        "selftext": "I believe I did pretty well in the market this year. My networth increased ~65% since its lowest point in March, [~350k to 620k](https://imgur.com/a/3Vu6u2f). 20k from the car I bought in March. I rolled over a 401k and it messed up Mint's reporting, hence the spike from Jul -&gt; Aug. \n\nI beat the [SP500 by 40%](https://imgur.com/a/adeDokD) in my YOLO account, my FAANG account went from [180-&gt;300](https://imgur.com/a/kBmBp1O)\n\nI did this by following some basic investing principles, buying and holding for the most part, being patient, and only investing in areas which I have expertise in. \n\nI did not buy into the TSLA hype, nor do I play options, nor do I play crypto. \n\n#High level advice:\n=========================================\n\nhttps://www.simplysafedividends.com/intelligent-income/posts/37-top-10-pieces-of-investment-advice-from-warren-buffett\n\nI picked the 7 I agree with.\n\n1. Invest in what you know\u2026and nothing more.\n2. Never compromise on business quality\n3. When you buy a stock, plan to hold it forever\n4. Diversification can be dangerous\n5. Most news is noise, not news (don't read articles about investing)\n8. The best moves are usually boring (buy and hold)\n10. Only listen to those you know and trust \n\nI firmly believe that anyone who follows those concepts, they will find success in investing.  \n\n#General mindset:\n================\n- Keep emotions out of the market\n- Don't bother timing the market. Don't get ruled by FOMO.\n- Understand that for some stocks, you can't really average cost down. You will have to stomach buying the stock at a higher entry point. My refusal to average up early on caused me to miss out on a lot of gains. \n- Understand the difference between trading, investing, and gambling. \n- Have an exit strategy (stop losses would have helped me a lot in March, I now learned from my expensive mistake)\n- Be greedy-- not TOO greedy. If a stock pops 10%, I will sell half to lock in profits. It's super common to see a lot of companies pop and the next day dip a bit due to sell off. Perfect time to grab more on the dip. This is obviously impossible to time, which is why I only sell half. \n\n#Application:\n==================================================================\nI was very specific in the types of companies I would choose to invest in within tech. I decided to follow my strengths. As a data engineer, I'm very intimate with cloud technologies, and I think I generally have pretty sharp business acumen and good strategic direction. \n\nAs a result, my day to day work had me using a ton of technologies in the cloud space. I've used Splunk, NewRelic, Twilio, AWS, GCP, Hortonworks/Cloudera, Oracle, Tableau, Datadog, Sendgrid (bought by Twilio), Dropbox/box, Slack, Salesforce, Marketo, Databricks, Snowflake, HP Vertica, just to name a few. I was familiar with CDN services like Fastly and Cloudflare because sometimes, I worked with the DevOps and IT guys. \n\nBased on industry hearsay, day to day work, eventually, I got a good \"feel\" of what technologies were widely adopted, easy to use, and had a good reputation in the industry. Similarly, I also got a feel for what tech were being considered 'dated' or not widely used (HP, Oracle, Cloudera, Dropbox, Box). \n\nI tend to shy away from companies that I don't understand. In the past, most times I've done that-- I got burned.  My biggest losers this year was betting on $NAT and $JMNA (10k total loss). After learning from those mistakes, I decided to only focus on investing in companies that either I or my peers have intimate first hand experience with using. Because of this rationale, the majority of stocks in my portfolio are products which I believe in, I thoroughly enjoy using, and I would recommend to my friends, family, and colleagues. \n\nPost COVID, due to the shift to remote work and increase in online shopping I decided to double down on tech. I already knew that eCommerce was the next big thing. I made very early investments into SHOP and Amazon in 2017 for that reason.\n\nMy hypothesis was that post-COVID, the shift on increased online activity, remote work, and eCommerce would mean that companies which build tools to support increased online activity should also increase. I decided to choose three sectors within tech to narrow down-- these were three sectors that I had a good understanding of, due to the nature of my work and personal habits. \n\n1. eCommerce + AdTech \n2. IT/DevOps (increased online activity means higher need for infra)\n3. FinTech (increased shopping activity means more transactions)\n\nThese are the points I consider before I consider jumping into a stock:\n\n1. Do I feel good about using the company? Do I believe in the company's vision?\n2. Where do I see this company in 5 years? 10 years? Do I see my potential children being around to use these companies?\n3. What does YoY, QoQ growth look like for this company? \n4. Is/Will this product be a core part of how businesses or people operate?\n5. Who are their customers and target demographic?\n6. (SaaS) Customer testimonials, white papers, case studies. If it's for a technology, I'm going to want to read a paper or use case.\n\nIn March, I took what I believe to be an \"educated gamble\". When the market crashed, I liquefied most of my non tech assets and reinvested them into tech. Some of the holdings I already had, some holdings were newly purchased.\n\nI have 50% of my networth in AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, FB, NFLX, and the rest in individual securities/mutual funds. I have 3 shares of TSLA that I got in @1.5.\n\nHere are the non FAANGs I chose.\n\n1. $SQ. I had already been invested in SQ since 2016. I made several bad trades, holding when it first blew past 90 until I sold it at 70... bought in again last year at 60s, after noticing that more and more B&amp;M stores were getting rid of their clunky POS systems and replacing it with Square's physical readers. After COVID, I noticed a lot of pop up vendors, restaurants doing take out. A Square reader made transactions very easy to make post-COVID. \n\n2. $ATVI. Call of Duty and Candy Crush print money for them. I've been a Blizzard fanboy since I was a kid, so I have to keep this just out of principle.\n\n3. $SHOP. They turned a profit this year, and I think there is still a lot more room to grow. It's become somewhat of a household name. I've met quite a few people who mentioned that they have a Shopify site set up to do their side hustle. I've tried the product myself, and can definitely attest that it's pretty easy to get an online shop up and running within a day. I 5.5xed my return here. \n\n4. $BIGC. I bought into this shortly after IPO. I'm very excited to see an American Shopify. BigC focuses on enterprise customers right now, and Shopify independent merchants, so I don't see them directly competing. I'm self aware this is essentially a gamble. I got in at 90, sold at 140, and added more in 120s. I def got lucky here... it's not common for IPOs to pop so suddenly. I honestly wasn't expecting it to pop so soon.\n\n5. $OKTA. Best in class SSO tool. Amazing tool that keeps tracks of all of my sign-ons at work. \n\n6. $DDOG. Great monitoring tool. Widely adopted and good recommendations throughout the industry. Always had a nice looking booth at GoogleNext.\n\n7. $ZM. Zoom was the only video conf tool at work which I had a good time using. Adoption had blown up pre-COVID already in the tech world, and post-COVID, they somehow became a noun. \"Zoom parties\" and \"Zoom dates\" somehow became a thing interwoven into peoples' day to day lives.\n\n8. $TWLO. Twilio sells APIs which allow applications to send messages like text, voice, and video chat. For example, when DoorDash sends you a text at 1 AM reminding you that your bad decision has arrived, that text is powered by Twilio. In March, New York announced that they were going to use Twilio to send SMS notifs for COVID contact tracing. \n\n10. $NET/$FSTY. These two two seem like the ones best poised for growth in the CDN space. This is based off of industry exposure and chatting with people who work in DevOps.\n\n11. $DOCU. people aren't going to office to sign stuff, super easy to use, I like their product. \n\n12. $WMT. eComm, streaming, and a very substantial engineering investment makes me think they have room to grow. Also I really need to diversify. \n\n13. $COST. When is the last time you heard someone say \"Man I hate going to Costco and paying $1.50 for a hotdog and soda?\" Diversification. Also cheap hotdogs.\n\n14. $NVDA/AMD. GPUs are the present and the future. Not only are they used for video games, but Machine Learning now uses GPU instead of CPU to do compute (Tensorflow for example). Crypto is still a thing as well, and there will always been a constant need for GPUs.\n\nMutual funds/ETFs\n1. $FSCSX. MF which focuses on FinTech. \n\n2. $VTSAX Pretty much moves with the SP500. \n\n3. $WCLD. Holdings include Salesforce, Workday, Zuora, Atlassian, Okta, New Relic, Fastly... \n\nTitanvest:\nI was an early access user, and I was able to secure 0% fees for my accout. 36% gains so far. I like them, because their portfolio happens to include shares of tech giants that I either don't have individual stocks for or my stake is low (CRM, PPYL). It nicely complements my existing portfolio.\n\n#Some things I do that that are against the grain:\n\n- Not really diversified. 80% is in tech. They are in very different sectors of tech, but the truth is, when tech falls, all of these companies fall. I'm obviously long tech and I do not believe that tech will fall anytime soon. What about the dot com bubble? There wasn't a single dot com company that was integral in our lives. The internet was in its infancy then. Techonology is now such an interwoven part of our lives and I see companies like Apple, Amazon, Google to be sticking around for several generations.\n\n- I don't read investing articles. I think people who write articles about a stock all have ulterior motives-- to pump or to dump. Case in point-- Citron Research spent years writing articles telling people how SHOP was overvalued. Why did they do that? Because they were shorters at the time. I turned 5k into 27k, because I held on to most of my SHOP shares.\n\n- I don't take much value from balance sheets, other than net loss, income, YoY growth. Instead, I use my business acumen to try to pick up on info that isn't super apparent from Google. For example, one thing I always do is that I look at the career page to see how the business is growing. Increase on marketing/sales/implementation engineers is typically a solid sign that a company is preparing headcount to take new deals in the upcoming quarters. I look at the product road map, supported integrations, and customer base. \n\nOne example was how I applied the above principle was to WalMart. In 2018 I noticed that I was getting targeted by a lot of Data engineering job listing for WalMartLabs-- WarMart's tech division. The role was to build out a big data pipeline to support their eCommerce platform. WalMart's online store released in Q3 of 2019. Post COVID, I used their online store and it was a seamless experience. They even offer a 5% cash back card like Amazon. They reported strong Q4 sales last year, and they did very well post COVID. Why did I choose to invest in $WMT? Because I believe that Wal-Mart has room to grow for their online platform. \n\nLastly... remember that wealth isn't accrued over time. It takes years to build. The quickest way to increase your wealth is by investing in yourself-- your career and earning potential. The sooner my income increased, the quicker I had more capital to buy into stocks. \n\nAlso, if you've gotten this far, the point of my post isn't to say that you should invest into tech. The message I'm trying to get across is-- when picking companies, pick companies in fields or verticals you have good knowledge in. Heed Buffet's advice to only pick companies you believe in and understand. Play to your strengths, don't mindless toss money based on one person's posts on Reddit-- always do your own due diligence. Use DD as a guide and use personal research and experience to drive your decision.",

        "selftext": "NFA (Not Financial Advice)\n\nHere's another round of some fairly comprehensive fundamental DD on a stock I believe is well positioned to provide many tendies going forward. If you hate reading, but want to spend your parent's inheritance on something that is somewhat defensible / not retarded, skip to the bottom for the bolded call.\n\n**I. The Company - CrowdStrike Holdings**\n\nIntroducing CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ: CRWD). Founded in 2011 by George Kurtz a former EVP @ McAfee &amp; 2 other guys (including a Russian hacking genius), the Company is a cloud native endpoint security provider. Google's venture capital arm initially put in $100mm into the Company &amp; while private, took in funding from a couple big names in the VC/PE space then went public in mid-2019. What the fuck does cloud native endpoint security mean? In an era where everything is shifting to the 'cloud' &amp; more folks work from home, this Company focuses on developing/implementing/selling cloud-based software that provides security to all 'endpoint' devices (laptops, servers, phones, tablets, etc.). Do I need to say more on how big this market opportunity is? Should be common sense at this point. To put some numbers to this - in June 2020, the endpoint security market was estimated to be \\~$8Bn total, &amp; adding up the other verticals CRWD participates in, the TAM (Total Addressable Market) of their line of products totals \\~$27Bn \\[9\\], though there are estimates that this is much higher. \n\nSo far, CRWD's products protect 49% of the Fortune 100's Company's endpoint devices \\[9\\], but before I go into more detail on what differentiates CrowdStrike from its competitors, I want to highlight a couple recent themes that are emerging which formed the pillars to my investment thesis.\n\n**II. CIO Investment Spending Surveys as of August 2020**\n\nAt the beginning &amp; midpoint of each year, the big investment banks conduct surveys from CIOs of major corporations to gain insight into where they intend to invest going forward. I have the most recent Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, &amp; Stifel surveys summarized here, which became publicized this month (8/2020)\n\n\\- JPM surveys 130 CIOs responsible for \\~$88Bn in annual enterprise IT spending, average IT budget of \\~$675mm per firm\n\n\\- GS compiles the results &amp; tracks an \"IT Spending Index\"; the latest results? IT Spending Index fell to 21.5 from 60.5 in 12/2019, which is the lowest level since GS began the index tracking in 2002\n\n\\- IT budgets set to shrink by \\~5%, removing the largest IT budgets (Companies with budgets &gt;$1Bn), set to shrink by \\~7% this year (JPM)\n\nSo, IT budgets are overall shrinking &amp; expected to be down. Let's get to the good shit:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Question to CIOs: Please describe the categories of project that will be impacted positively\\/negatively by the COVID-19 pandemic &amp; global economic recession](https://preview.redd.it/mdbqee86i9j51.jpg?width=485&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=399ea22eb349e284f06ac8902efe53ee4e6bf691)\n\n\\- 79% of CIOs believe COVID is acting as a forcing function to make them digitally transform &amp; move to the public Cloud even faster than they had planned with 36% of them increasing their spend in these areas for 2020 &amp; beyond (JPM)\n\n\\- Security remains the top spending priority, followed up with Collaboration Applications, Business Intelligence/Analytics, Workflow Automation &amp; Public Cloud (GS)\n\n\\- Within Security, Identity, Firewall, &amp; Endpoint are top priorities - 36% of CIOs polled expect Security spending to accelerate in 2020. Caveat: Is down compared to 10-year average of 38% (GS)\n\n\\- Endpoint screened at #3, down from #1 for the first time since June 2016 - believe drop in ranking is temporary as shift in spending priorities to ensure seamless provisioning/de-provisioning of user rights accesses &amp; secured traffic workflow to corporate network for WFH. This also may be due to the significant decline in PC spending from the 12/2019 survey (21% expected to increase PC spending vs. 33% prior) - more on this below (GS)\n\n\\- Percentage of survey respondents that mentioned 'endpoint security' as a highly prioritized area of security investment expanded from 42.4% in the 1Q'20 VAR survey to 81.3% in the 2Q'20 VAR survey (Stifel)\n\n**III. WTF is Endpoint Security &amp; Comparable Products from a Computer Autist**\n\nSince I'm fairly new to what the fuck \"cybersecurity\" is, I'm assuming most of you autists are as well. Here are my findings on 3 major components of cybersecurity - Identity, Firewall &amp; Endpoint.\n\nThink of Identity/Firewall as basically the Security implementations a Company deploys that occur 'outside' of your Company issued device. Basically, it is all the encryption &amp; other shit that secures your user ID/password &amp; engages in the web traffic, etc. you go through. \n\nEndpoint on the other hand is basically 2 parts. 1st part is akin to your Anti-Virus bloatware shit that comes pre-installed on most retail laptops, etc. &amp; runs in the background of your device constantly monitoring everything going on to make sure some weird file with an embedded virus ends up on your device. I might get shit from the real cybersecurity folks on this, but I'm not an IT guy - I'm the user of these devices, I'm the one fucking paying you. Your 'endpoint' security thing is software that replaces my anti-virus, so I see it as similar. Deal with it fucking nerds. \n\nThe 2nd part is what sets it apart from traditional AV software - which is some magical, computer geek shit that monitors 'network' activity that occurs as your device sends information out of your device &amp; receives information from the web, usb devices, or whatever. This is where the 'Cloud' &amp; 'AI' stuff occurs - a bit more on this later. \n\nPicture this: if you've ever worked on a Company issued device in the past, there's one thing that always sticks out. The AV is fucking annoying - when working with large excel files/presentations, basically anything outside of web surfing/email, there is a noticeable lag that really pisses you off, especially when you're in time-crunch situations &amp; need to get work done quickly. On your personal devices, you can just pause the scans or whatever, but on Company issued devices you'll get random lag spikes &amp; from my personal experience it is usually due to the security bloatware that you cannot uninstall. \n\nSo what differentiates CRWD? There are a bunch of benchmarks full of computer-geek jargon but overall, the top products block \\~99% of threats &amp; deal with them in their own manners that are OK to me. So what do I want to focus on, &amp; what matters to me as a non-IT employee is efficiency. So, I've done some research into CRWD's claim that they provide a 'light-weight' solution to all this. I don't give a fuck about how the Samsung Galaxy Note has a pen &amp; all those gimmicks if it isn't executed well. I like my iPhone not because it can do all those weird things Androids can do, I like it b/c out of all the simplistic things I want a phone to do, it does it well, does it without lag, &amp; does it predictably. CRWD seems to aim for this type of experience for the end user while providing top of the line cybersecurity. \n\nThe market leaders in the endpoint security space based on market share as of July 2019 are: Symantec (16%), Trend Micro (12%), McAfee (12%) &amp; a few steps down is Crowdstrike (5%) \\[6\\]. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[As of July 2019](https://preview.redd.it/tbatexuog9j51.jpg?width=344&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ea99f254dc8f92597b75a3a84df4bfebf64fd49)\n\nSo based on these comps, I want to try to proxy for which of the companies above offer an Endpoint Protection product that fits me, the most likely average user.\n\nI'm going to proxy the 'load' of each Company's product, proxied by RAM Usage:\n\n\\- Symantec: 25MB of RAM, takes up \\~450MB of hard drive \\[1\\]\n\n\\- McAfee: Claims 75MB of RAM, complaints of 150-200MB+ \\[2\\]\n\n\\- Trend Micro: Requirements of &gt;256MB of RAM, install size of \\~350MB \\[3\\]. They have all these configurations on how to reduce CPU usage but I'm going to ignore that as I want to compare standard installs. Google is full of complaints on how much memory usage other Trend Micro products utilize that bogs down computer performance\n\n\\- **CrowdStrike: \\~25MB of your hard drive &amp; uses 2MB of RAM; also consumes 4-6MB of bandwidth/day \\[4\\]** \n\nClearly the winning solution is CrowdStrike. With the previously mentioned finding that there will be a decline of PC buying as a CIO priority, older systems will be utilized for a bit longer than usual going forward. However, the size &amp; complexity of software will continue to demand more &amp; more computing power, paving the path for CRWD implementation as one of the easiest ways for an organization to improve efficiency while retaining the most advanced modern form of cybersecurity - a tailwind many might be overlooking, &amp; something the Sales teams at CRWD are undoubtedly pushing. \n\n**IV. What else differentiates CrowdStrike &amp; Total Addressable Market Continued**\n\nSo we've gone over the market opportunity size &amp; why CRWD's main product, Endpoint Security (called Falcon Prevent) would be the preferred choice for regular autistic users like myself, but couple other things:\n\n\\- On Gartner.com - which reviews &amp; compiles customer experiences of cybersecurity products, CRWD is the most highly rated &amp; has one of the leading \"would recommend\" %s of 98% \\[5\\]  \n\n\\- While every fucking Company in the Tech space likes to throw around the term \"AI\" &amp; \"Cloud\", these guys are legit in their claims. The reason their Endpoint Security is so lightweight is because it is Cloud-based &amp; is AI-based in its architecture. Meaning - for every incremental customer added, the Endpoint Security collects more data &amp; gets smarter. \n\nI'll get into how the Company scales financially later, but it's important to note that the product exhibits similar characteristics. Their product, along with its revenues, will scale with each additional customer added.\n\nCRWD's host of products are offered in 10 distinct modules across endpoint security, security &amp; operations, &amp; threat intelligence:\n\n\\- Endpoint Security: Falcon Prevent (Nextgen AV - AI-based), Falcon Insight (Endpoint Detection &amp; Response), &amp; USB Device Control\n\n\\- Security &amp; Operations: Falcon Overwatch (Prov. customers with access to dedicated experts - managed threat hunting solution), Falcon Discover (gives deep visibility into endpoints on a customer's network), Falcon Spotlight (IDs unpatched vulnerabilities in real time running on endpoints), Falcon Complete (Comprehensive managed solution)  \n\\- Threat Intelligence: Falcon X (Leading threat research &amp; intelligence), Falcon Search Engine, Falcon Sandbox.   \n\\- Crowdstrike Store: Provides 3rd party app developers the ability to leverage CRWD's cloud native architecture &amp; lightweight agent to create custom 3rd party apps\n\nAll said, CRWD charges $6.99 - $17.99 per endpoint, per month.\n\nIn the U.S., it's estimated that there are \\~1.2 endpoints per employee at every company in the US with &gt;100 employees. At the aforementioned pricing, this represents potential revenues per year of $8.2Bn - $21.1Bn \\[6\\]. Remember this is the U.S. only - in 2019, CRWD generated 23% of its revenues outside of the U.S., and as of the most recent quarter, this came in at 27%. Globally, Morgan Stanley predicts the IT security spending market to reach $128Bn; while currently, 24% of IT security spend is spent on Endpoint Security. Putting these 2 together implies a TAM of \\~$31Bn. \\[8\\] All of these calcs from extremely credible sources seem to imply that management's use of IDC's estimate that CRWD's 2020E TAM of $8Bn is an extremely conservative estimate (also something to note: what goes in each Company's investor presentations is highly scrutinized by internal legal counsel, so they play it as safe as they can - unless you're Elon Musk).\n\n**V. Financials** \n\nCRWD likes to market themselves to the investor community as the category-defining cloud platform for Security. CRM Cloud is dominated by SalesForce, Service Management by ServiceNow, HR by Workday, &amp; Security by CRWD. So from the angle of a SaaS investment opportunity, the main things to focus on are subscription customers, ARR (annual recurring revenue) &amp; billings plus the corresponding growth rates in each of the categories.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s64sdnjqi9j51.jpg?width=895&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd78748412a99433eaecb54229b89c42a2c2e8af\n\nCRWD as of the most recent quarter has 6,261 customers which grew by +105% YoY, adding +830 from the previous quarter. ARR came in at $686mm which grew +88% YoY. Billings came in at $231mm, representing +90% YoY growth. \n\nThis is cool &amp; all, but let's look at some ratios, &amp; how they compare relatively to other SaaS peers.\n\nLTV (Lifetime Value) to CAC (Customer Acquisition Costs) ratio -&gt; higher ratio means Company is acquiring new customers at higher levels of profitability &amp; S&amp;M investments will translate to higher profitability over time:\n\nCRWD is in the top 5 out of 34 SaaS companies with a LTV:CAC of 5.8x as of the most recent quarter vs. a 2.6x Median across SaaS companies \\[6\\]\\[7\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[CRWD as of MRQ - Remainder as of 7\\/2019](https://preview.redd.it/doj9bjpxg9j51.jpg?width=535&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb0c696c6d5772caf2b0e6446ccfc4296b8dfc86)\n\nAnother interesting feature is they went EBITDA positive for the 2nd quarter in a row - a first in the Company's history; also want to add their EBITDA went bigly positive, growing by +270% QoQ from barely eeking out EBITDA of $0.3mm a quarter ago. \n\nWhat about sales efficiency? This is important as we want to assess the variable costs associated with generating incremental ARR &amp; can be defined as the LTM S&amp;M Expense / New ARR. As of the most recent quarter, CRWD clocks in a ratio of 0.9x, &amp; is in the top 10 out of the 34 SaaS comparables \\[6\\]\\[7\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[CRWD as of MRQ - Remainder as of 7\\/2019](https://preview.redd.it/qcvf2hk3h9j51.jpg?width=532&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d4b83a2bcadc9d7bd7e6cb8a1118834ec292d9f)\n\n**Final Remarks - Valuation / Is Everything Priced In? &amp; Quick Management Overview**\n\nSo far we've covered the scope &amp; size of the Cybersecurity market, gone over some reasons why CRWD is differentiated, &amp; have shown that their unit economics / business model is being executed at the highest levels. How does all this translate into a stock price?\n\nLet's start with market share. Goldman estimates that these guys crank out \\~$780mm of Revenues this year, &amp; based on Management's conservative view of TAM totaling \\~$27Bn this year \\[9\\], that shakes out to a *paltry 3% market share* for CRWD. Other analysts (JPM, Stifel) are pegging Rev. to this \\~$770-$780mm mark, &amp; based on everything said about the Company, their recent performance, all of these estimates seem to be *'playing it safe'* which should result in the Company positioned to 'beat' earnings expectations going forward. If you've done this autistic earnings play shit for long enough, you'll learn quickly that this is how the game is played; especially for high growth companies. \n\nAll of this put together, I am **modeling a near/medium-term share price target of $120 - $135 per Share**. This represents a 21x - 24x EV/Sales multiple on \\~$1.3Bn of Sales, which corresponds to a \\~4.8% market share. Other SaaS companies like CRM, SHOP, NOW &amp; WDAY trade at an average EV/2021E Sales of 17.4x, with 3-year Rev. CAGRs of \\~28%. More importantly, SHOP trades at 33x EV/2021E Sales &amp; has a 3-year Rev. CAGR of 44% &amp; on the low end is CRM (more mature now) which trades at 9.6x EV/Sales with a 21% 3-year Rev. CAGR. The unit economics &amp; current macro backdrop suggests CRWD should be at least a 30% Rev. CAGR company, which warrants the \\~20x EV/Sales price target. \n\nMore on the Rev figures: \\~$1.3Bn of Rev. shakes out to Subscription Customers totaling \\~11,800 based on their most recent ARR/Subscription Customer of \\~$110k (which is below their '19 &amp; '20 figures). While this may seem like some insane figure to reach given their most recent quarter had total subscription customers of 6,261, it is easy to make sense of if you think about how at the end of 2019, they had total subscription customers of 2,516 - so from then to now they've grown by \\~2.6x! I will re-evaluate my positions if the stock breaches $140/Share. As a side note: Salesforce went from 10.5% market share in 2008 to 16.4% in 2009, their biggest jump in Company history. These SaaS companies really start to accelerate when shit hits the fan, CRWD is well positioned to mimic this phenomenon. \n\nQuick management overview: \n\nGeorge Kurtz is their CEO - has \\~30% of total Class B shares, controls \\~23% of CRWD's voting power. Dude is 49 years old, been doing cybersecurity for nearly 30 years, &amp; prior to CRWD was the worldwide CTO of McAfee. He later resigned from McAfee (where he was undoubtedly probably getting paid millions with a good shot at becoming CEO) to found CRWD with Dmitri Alperovitch &amp; Gregg Marston. There are stories about what prompted the move, &amp; one he usually talks about is how while at McAfee &amp; on an international flight, he saw one of the passengers seated next to him boot up his laptop &amp; wait 15 minutes for the McAfee AV software to load up to begin working. This story jives with my previous observation on the light-weightedness of CRWD's product vs. competitors. Anyway, this dude is definitely in line to produce as many tendies as possible along with us as he has a million shares that vest in 48 equal monthly installments that began on 11/2018 &amp; another 350k shares that vest over 24 equal monthly installments beginning in 11/2022. On top of this, he has $131mm / 2mm additional RSUs that vest in 16 equal *quarterly* installments which began on 12/2018 - meaning this huge chunk of RSUs are starting to hit their stride this year, &amp; you know Kurtz is definitely going to do what it takes to maximize the value of this. \\[10\\]\n\n\\[1\\] [https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/communities/community-home/digestviewer/viewthread?MessageKey=7101aafb-4290-4945-af3a-dd1e79f73659&amp;CommunityKey=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&amp;tab=digestviewer](https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/communities/community-home/digestviewer/viewthread?MessageKey=7101aafb-4290-4945-af3a-dd1e79f73659&amp;CommunityKey=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&amp;tab=digestviewer)\n\n\\[2\\] [https://community.mcafee.com/t5/Endpoint-Security-ENS/ENS-10-6-10-5-4-McShield-Average-Memory-Usage/td-p/596633](https://community.mcafee.com/t5/Endpoint-Security-ENS/ENS-10-6-10-5-4-McShield-Average-Memory-Usage/td-p/596633)\n\n\\[3\\] [http://www.ingrammicro.com/healthcare/TrendMicro\\_enterprise-security-endpoints.pdf](http://www.ingrammicro.com/healthcare/TrendMicro_enterprise-security-endpoints.pdf)\n\n\\[4\\] [https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ-266/images/WhitepaperGuidetoAVReplacement.pdf](https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ-266/images/WhitepaperGuidetoAVReplacement.pdf)\n\n\\[5\\] [https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/endpoint-protection-platforms/vendor/crowdstrike/product/falcon/alternatives](https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/endpoint-protection-platforms/vendor/crowdstrike/product/falcon/alternatives)\n\n\\[6\\] Goldman Sachs CrowdStrike Holdings Initiation - July 8, 2019\n\n\\[7\\] [https://ir.crowdstrike.com/node/7686/pdf](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/node/7686/pdf)\n\n\\[8\\] [https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2020/04/05/2020-roundup-of-cybersecurity-forecasts-and-market-estimates/#1dd80739381d](https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2020/04/05/2020-roundup-of-cybersecurity-forecasts-and-market-estimates/#1dd80739381d)\n\n\\[9\\] [https://ir.crowdstrike.com/static-files/547e5c92-3594-4eef-9dfc-9eca37b635f4](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/static-files/547e5c92-3594-4eef-9dfc-9eca37b635f4)\n\n\\[10\\] [https://www.bamsec.com/filing/104746920003177?cik=1535527](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/104746920003177?cik=1535527)",

        "selftext": "Hey guys, it's the \"$CRM\" guy from last ER season (You can see my post history to find it since I've only posted twice). If you've been following me on Twitter you'd know I have hit my goal of 1M since starting with 10k in June 2018. I've been consistently playing the earnings run ups and scalping until stumbled up a gem of a play I think that everyone can get in &amp; benefit in time, this is $CSCO. Earnings Aug 12.   \n\n\nThe $CSCO weekly/daily chart is beautifully intact on an uptrend and creating lower lows &amp; looking to bust out with a higher high. [https://i.imgur.com/JkmLeBm.png](https://i.imgur.com/JkmLeBm.png) The target is a run up to $50-51 which would increase the calls by 200-300% minimum. Besides the target, why is this a great play? Because this stock DOES NOT MOVE, it's FLAT. This means that the options are priced INCREDIBLY cheap. Take a look at Aug 21 $52 calls, going for .22 &amp; Aug 21 $53 calls going for .14. That's absolutely insane &amp; if anyone remembers last ER season, $CSCO ran up and IV premiums spiked hard to give call holders profit. A great risk/reward set up, IMO the worst case is the stock continues flat/down &amp; premiums barely spike and it leaves you with close to a break even or small loss but the best case can be a 8-10% run up into 500% returns BEFORE earnings are out. As you can see, I don't care about whether the actual ER will beat or not (it should) but I am only concerned with the run up, you cannot beat the market makers majority of time by holding through earnings.   \n\n\nDisclosure: I own $CSCO $50 $51 $52 $53 calls Aug 21 expiry. Some of you may take Aug 14, but I would do Aug 21 because I think as we head closer, people will pay for TIME premium.",

        "selftext": " \n\nI want to first preface this by saying that is an unconventional DD - read at your own risk. I will not be going into TA nor FA to justify why $WORK is the next big play.\n\n**Recap &amp; Highlights:**\n\n\\- $WORK reports its earnings on 09/02\n\n\\- $WORK is currently trading between $29-$30\n\n\\- $WORK beat its earnings expectations last quarter (Actual -0.02 vs Expected -0.06)\n\n\\- After $WORK reported earnings, its share price plummeted down to \\~$32\n\n\\- $WORK is expected to report -0.03 EPS for the upcoming quarter\n\n**Due Diligence:**\n\n\\- The hype hasn't yet started. And once it starts, it\u2019ll explode. Hype is the only reason why $WORK was trading near $40 pre-ER 2 months ago. Hype is the reason why $TSLA saw 70% capital appreciation in 3 weeks. Hype is the reason why PRPL - sorry. I guess it\u2019s too soon for you sad fucking sheeptards, I\u2019ll stop right here.\n\n[No recent $WORK posts](https://preview.redd.it/yg6dk94wtlf51.png?width=1554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fa49c22cd73e7b926d81e42c466ca12fd02363b)\n\n[No recent Slack posts](https://preview.redd.it/ask5fiv3ulf51.png?width=1564&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f4bfbf3c8ed0f1fe94ea57aefb849a34a729d90)\n\n\\- Other dogshit, popular tech companies like $DBX, $PD, $SNAP, $CRM, $WDAY, $SPLK, $ATVI, $ROKU and $DDOG all had their run ups to new ATH pre-ER despite their shitty/decent performances from last quarter, so why not $WORK?\n\nThat's it. That\u2019s my entire rendition.\n\nIt's a shit stock, but people will still hype it up because it's tech and it's popular. The hyped up buying power could kick in as early as next week, but it will surely kick in within a few weeks time. Don\u2019t you want to get in on the train early before it takes off like PRPL, $SLV and $NKLA? Then just buy your September calls right now. Who cares if you lose time-value when the increase in IV due to the earnings hype can compensate for it? $WORK was one of the most hyped up tech stocks before last ER. Just close the position out right before it. It\u2019s trading near \\~$29 without any hype whatsoever. Perfect entry.\n\n**Proof of 9.5k yolo:**\n\n[31.5c 09/11 9.5k YOLO](https://preview.redd.it/96yswmoptlf51.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bffdccbc9eca09d2dd6416aece94a824a5c2aaae)\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nWill it beat earnings? - Who cares?\n\nHow does it compare with its competitors? - Equally shitty if not shittier.\n\nIs the company profitable? - Not yet, and the future outlook looks grim when it's still going under during an all WFH-age.\n\nWhat do you think about the stock? - It's shit. There are better options.\n\nBut will it have a run-up and hype? - Absolutely. Just close before ER.\n\nDon\u2019t follow the hype. Create it.\n\n$WORK 31.5c 09/11",

        "selftext": "**The Case for Zuora: The Growth Stock of a Lifetime**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nZuora focuses on one, simple to understand niche; cloud software to enable subscription-based services. A subscription-based model is one in which a business may lend or sell goods based on recurrent payments made at decided intervals. Now as you may be able to tell based on news, ads, or generally being a consumer this is a fast-growing and competitive environment where almost all sectors are participating in, and the model has existed since the early 17th century when book publishers had used these platforms to generate consistent revenues from their most loyal readers. The CEO of Zuora believes their product is like CRM for a subscription-based economy: \u201cCRM and ERP systems, however, were designed for products, not for companies with subscription business models. In a world where every customer is now a subscriber, companies must adopt new technology to manage the entire subscriber lifecycle, including new subscriber acquisition, subscription management (i.e. enabling subscribers to upgrade, downgrade, renew and otherwise modify their subscriptions), automating recurring billing and payments, and measuring recurring revenue and subscription metrics\u201d, and in a basic sense this would make Zuora a fintech company, like Square (SQ) or even Rocket Companies (RKT) via automating billing solutions, but Zuora also provides analytics for subscription-based producers such as market trends and relation analysis with subscribers. Zuora\u2019s RevPro accounting and revenue solution aims to \u201cMeet compliance for the latest revenue standards and accelerate your time to close\u201d, and in this subscription-based economy, that efficiency will mean everything. Automating accounting, CRM, sales and marketing, and product management make Zuora the one-stop-shop for SaaS companies like Zoom, DocuSign, and BetterCloud. Considering their new partnership with GoCardless ([Zuora and GoCardless Expand Partnership to Revolutionize Global Subscription Payments](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zuora-gocardless-expand-partnership-revolutionize-120000704.html)) and the growing subscription based economy ([More Than Half Of US Households Now Subscribe To Multiple Streaming Services \u2013 Study](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/more-half-u-households-now-153943744.html)), ZUO only has room to grow. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2jhh49pfysj51.png?width=270&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2031aa4b890903bf76ce993d3110a96ab6502984\n\nIn terms of financials, Zuora has recently increased spending and debt, which is sort of a natural phase for growth stocks like them, but it can be a bit concerning\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9sg24ouhysj51.png?width=707&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42fb21aa89bf6bb1566b2b44d659fcc664e6a604\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut as you can also see here, they are consistently generating revenue directly as a result of their tie-ups with SaaS based platforms, and yes the below costs are going up but a majority of them have to do with levering and increased R&amp;D\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i7z5foikysj51.png?width=516&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e65ae7cc41e46b91bc311722b4bd7fbb4455d055\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I wouldn\u2019t concern myself with any of these effects as they are common out of growth stocks like ZUO which are constantly seeking out newer opportunities and require more financing. The best part of all this is that SG&amp;A is going down because they are becoming a well-known competitor and service in this space, and almost any other company in this space will look the same financially\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost of their assets are not financed by long term debt, so this will bring a great peace of mind to traditional investors who think debt is evil:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/boijqw6wysj51.png?width=627&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45e8dda2c3cdba51973ae170d10b43ae28d230dd\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd sales have increased so much, that the P/S ratio is lower than it was when the share prices peaked\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wf2cnkq4zsj51.png?width=630&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=806541fe93d99d688a86710983dfe0e183856ad9\n\nAnd most importantly, FCF has increased which means that the company\u2019s financial structure has allowed for more retention of cash, something that can be necessary when you\u2019re a fledgling company in a volatile and competitive market space.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vurn2ft7zsj51.png?width=429&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd88a9b57f889e70ee2fa65bd19d72d6141fba91\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn top of that, gross profit margins are finally turning around for this year, and should continue to increase for the future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sr4ysuw9zsj51.png?width=466&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f170c6dd8baa2c4867803ebd8d7d2d1052ec9764\n\nPeople are moving further and further away from owning goods which is why we\u2019ve seen the rise in SaaS and PaaS, even from companies like Caterpillar who make industrial equipment for construction and mining, we\u2019ve seen revolutions in how we can be efficient with products and services, and companies like AirBnB and Turo have shown us the consumer mentality going forward. Caterpillar uses Zuora software to manage and interact with those who rent their machinery by installing sensors into the engines of trucks themselves to monitor fuel usage and tow haul, this gives them a better idea of what the consumer needs and makes an immediate impact on future engineering plans, so now even seemingly traditional industries have shifted their focus to subscription planning and management digitally. [https://www.thestreet.com/investing/zuoras-ceo-were-seeing-greater-interest-in-subscription-business-models-tien-tzuo?puc=yahoo&amp;cm\\_ven=YAHOO](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/zuoras-ceo-were-seeing-greater-interest-in-subscription-business-models-tien-tzuo?puc=yahoo&amp;cm_ven=YAHOO), in this interview the CEO of Zuora had to say this about their impact on the economy during covid: \u201c\"Absolutely. And that\u2019s what really excites us. Companies are...saying, \u2018Thank god we\u2019re a subscription business. Thank god we have the resiliency. We can\u2019t imagine managing through this current situation not as a subscription business. We\u2019re not seeing 50, 60, 70%, overnight drops in revenue, that\u2019s just not happening.'\n\nAnd even \\[among\\] the companies that are being adversely impacted by the current environment, they\u2019re shrinking, but they\u2019re shrinking slowly. They\u2019re doing a good job of hanging onto their subscriber bases\u201d,\n\nI\u2019m confident this company will outperform long and short term, and the fact that they\u2019ve picked out just one area to operate in will make it easier for them in the long term as well, and we\u2019ll see costs and debt be cut in the future so that retained earnings and EBITDA can increase causing more market interest in ZUO.\n\n\\*\\*Tl;dr ZUO calls for October/November (16c) , shares and LEAPs as deep as u want ;)",

        "selftext": "For many of you, Workday's 13% after hours jump yesterday was the first time you heard of Workday. And that's understandable. But wake up, Sheeple. Wake up and smell the roses.\n\nWorkday's Human Capital Management software is not sexy and curvy like most other cloud company offerings. But that's exactly why this stock is a steal right now.\n\n**FINANCIALS**\n\nThe market capitalization of \\~$50B is confoundingly rational and grounded. This is criminally low for a cloud software company with: \n\n* Over $1B in quarterly earnings\n* A track record of stellar quarterly earnings growth (&gt;=20% the past two years)\n* A SaaS business model\n* Widespread adoption among the S&amp;P 500\n* **A quarterly loss of only $16.8M compared to $122.5M in the same quarter last year.** Holy shit, these guys CFO\n* Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $2.75B (!!!!!!)\n\n**THE REAL JUICY DD FROM AN INDUSTRY INSIDER**\n\nYes, I am an industry insider.\n\n* [Look at their top executives.](https://www.workday.com/en-gb/company/about-workday/leadership.html) The vast majority of them are Ex-Oracle. Most of the rest are ex-SAP/Salesforce. These are not tech upstarts, they are industry veterans executing on a meticulous plan. They had excruciating familiarity with how shitty the Oracle HCM (PeopleSoft) was, and built the perfect product\n* Which brings me to my second point. HR insiders are unanimous in viewing Workday HCM as an upgrade over PeopleSoft and SAP. Because it is an upgrade. Whether the majority of employees are white collar or blue collar - it is a fucking upgrade. Oracle and SAP products are dying cash cows with Stone Age capabilities. Essentially, Workday's only competition is resistance to change and lack of resources on the behalf of HR leaders\n* This bullet point is what made me buy shares last year. **Workday's sales and distribution channels are fucking insane.** For example, all the major HR consulting firms sell Workday to their clients. Because it's a fucking upgrade. That's right, THERE ARE WHOLE OTHER COMPANIES THAT SELL WORKDAY TO CLIENTS. On top of that, Workday's own Sales and Marketing staff are overwhelmingly Ex-Oracle, so they leverage their connections to convert past clients\n\nIT STILL HAS ROOM TO RUN. RETAIL INVESTORS HAVEN'T CAUGHT ON YET.\n\nPosition: I have shares. Options at open and/or LEAPS are the play for gamblers.",

        "selftext": "VMWare has a really good set up right now and should easily beat earnings estimates. With the migration to the cloud, most companies are starting to at least adopt some form of a hybrid cloud solution. This also means that they're facing integration challenges and now have to invest in software to allow on-premise networks and public and private clouds to interface with each other, which is where VMWare comes in. It's already the best of breed service in terms of virtual machines, and it should keep in line with its ridiculous growth rate (\\~15% CAGR over the past few years) as it rolls out more software solutions for hybrid clouds and network virtualization. Trading multiples for VMWare are unreasonably low and the stock is significantly undervalued (should at least be 170 imo...200+ in a sane world). This is literally a GEM with very minimal downside, and rn is a perfect entry point. VMWare will absolutely run post earnings and calls will print (pretty low theta and IV on them too). Salesforce destroyed it and is now up 26% on the day, and my money is on VMWare to see a similar pump post earnings (should easily run up 10+% over the next few weeks/month)\n\nPlay: 10/16 150 call (September calls should also print)",

Although we respect it, we also are willing, and wanting to continue with everyday life. Principles for race, equality, fairness and environment wellness are still top of mind, despite virus news constantly being thrown in our face. Seems like we are getting over the whole ordeal.\n\nElections coming up, job recovery top of mind, more stimulus on the horizon and the seeming rift between the stock market and the real economy are all interesting factors that can affect in either direction the stock market.\n\nNevertheless, there is one reality that is undeniable. The markets have never been more skewed with technology and pharmaceuticals at the forefront of the whole thing. The top 5 stocks on the S&amp;P500 now account for more than 20% of its value!\n\nIn any case, historically strong sectors like energy, Real estate, travel and tourism are still down anywhere from 30% to 70% from their pre-covid levels.\n\nArguably the most important catalyst the stock market waits for right now is the official approval of a vaccine that is \u201caccepted\u201d by the authorities. Once this happens, for sure airlines and tourism will catch a breather, also energy as demands open back up, and simply pent up demand from being in quarantined.\n\nI guess my though is the following: Assuming an approval is around the corner anywhere from now to the next 6 or 8 months, once that happens what does the market correction look like?\n\nWill it be an overall push higher for the market as a whole? Or will it be a massive redistribution of capital where a lot of what is tied up in tech and stay-at-home stocks goes back to these more traditional asset classes?\n\nThoughts of a Psycho Trader\u2026.",

        "selftext": "Swaggy is back with his Sunday morning read of Unusual Options Activity. I get a lot of DMs asking about the activity, so if you want to read a bit about option flow, I made [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwaggyStocks/comments/i2cwm1/unusual_options_activity_option_flow_what_it_is/) describing how it works.\n\nIn addition, if you would like to check out the option flow tool and scan for yourself, here is the [option flow tool](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/option-flow).\n\nAs for unusual trades, it\u2019s been pretty quiet the last two weeks. Most flow is coming into big tech stocks and pumping them higher. I caught a few other smaller plays that I\u2019ll get into the details of here.\n\n**MSFT \u2013 Microsoft Corporation**\n\nMicrosoft has been a repeat name for some bullish flow in the last months. Looks like players have been opening bull call spreads with relatively medium-term expirations (end of the year) expecting the stock to continue it\u2019s slow rise up. The range of strike prices has been $215-$240. MSFT has been one of the companies looking to acquire TikTok in the latest rumors. Other names that have seen some similar flow last week were AMZN, FB, ADBE, and of course, AAPL.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tmrkvz3e4ri51.png?width=2150&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5128bc760d4ad4905cf479242fa4be52c7dfcd5\n\n**NVDA \u2013 NVIDIA Corporation**\n\nNVDA reported earnings last week and although they blew estimates out of the water, the stock remained flat post-earnings. NVDA demonstrated some high growth in their server market and overall they have been one of the best performing tech stonks. Flow has been mixed, but leaning on the bullish side. Overall activity has picked up greatly since last week as traders could be expecting another move up.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1klzg6ze4ri51.png?width=2430&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d91676e3f077ecd17e9a2f2d604de2ac8b64563\n\n**QCOM \u2013 QUALCOMM Incorporated**\n\nQCOM is another semi-conductor company that has seen a good run over the last several months. Players placed bets that the company would continue it\u2019s steady rise up as demand for chips in a more data-driven world are becoming the new norm. A lot of calls were traded with strikes in the $105-$120 range. These mostly have expirations from November to January 2021, so they are mid-term in the timeframes and expectations.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rv6wpktf4ri51.png?width=1610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f5f1ed70da42174709714410765d64535b69f56\n\n**ORCL \u2013 Oracle Corporation**\n\nORCL has seen an uptick in activity on the bullish side. Rumors are they are making a bid for the TikTok acquisition as well. ORCL\u2019s stock price has been somewhat stagnant over the last several months and they didn\u2019t rally as hard as the rest of big tech from the March lows. The option flow might indicate a bullish move in the future for this stock.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j6njzexg4ri51.png?width=2420&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fcb092d4b6735bb223c38bedc6fff892e0e33f7\n\n**LYFT \u2013 Lyft Inc**\n\nLYFT and UBER have shut down service in California due to a new ruling that would require them to treat independent contractors as employees with benefits moving forward. Their rebuttal was to simply shut-down service and put the pressure back on the government to make their next move. Soon it will show that these ride-sharing companies have become a staple in our societal culture as they have made our lives so much easier. A whole slew of some pretty large calls were opened last week that was caught as bullish flow. I\u2019m not sure what the catalyst would be here, maybe it\u2019s because the stock is near the lows and shutting down service actually induces less losses on the company. Who knows.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0pxz92li4ri51.png?width=2020&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5eed0add829b6b63c17a73322ccab635ca8d309\n\n**DLTR \u2013 Dollar Tree Inc**\n\nDollar Tree caught some unusual call volume last week. Looks like players are betting on a 10% gain in the stock price with the October strike. These bets weren\u2019t unusually large in size, but for a company like DLTR they were pretty significant. The plays were sweeps at the $108 strike in Sept 25/Oct 02 expirations. The stock has had a decent run over the last several months and the players are expecting another leg up soon. We\u2019ll see about this one.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k3dkhbkj4ri51.png?width=1902&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1de6a827de4fd6572df1600de3f839783271624\n\n**CRM \u2013 Salesforce**\n\nCRM/Salesforce has been a hot stock recently. There was some bullish flow earlier this month and again into last week. My scanner picked up two long position, although in my opinion it looks like a spread was opened (still bullish). The spread was actually opened when the stock was trading at $197, and it is currently $10 higher at $207. The player bought to open 11,000 calls at the $200 strike and sold 11,000 calls at the $220 strike, paying $9 million for the position. They are already profitable on their position, but if CRM closes above $220 by February, they will have a net profit of $22 million.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qkw6lpok4ri51.png?width=1612&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4cf3112c70a994a5724707e18b3376cb6490b43d\n\n**CZR \u2013 Caesars Entertainment Inc**\n\nCZR caught some bullish activity last week when players opened January and March 2021 calls. The stock has already had an unbelievable recovery from the March lows, but is still nowhere near the highs. Looks like as the country opens back up again (if it stays that way), they expect the company to continue it\u2019s good performance. Some of the bullish flow was put-selling, which suggests the stock will have already reached it\u2019s long-term bottom.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uzkpssol4ri51.png?width=1620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7978edf9012a3334d7978075da93bac94215fd1",

        "selftext": "VMware is a cloud infrastructure and SaaS company that has been growing every product line double digits for the past few years. Their stock has been flying under the radar for a long time, mostly due to the technical nature of their products and services. Since most of their products are the backbone to a lot of the cloud services businesses &amp; consumers use and given the recent push towards cloud and digital transformation because of coronavirus, they have stated in earnings call that they expect increased demand and continuous growth. At the very least, their stock should follow the same trajectory of other cloud service providers such as Microsoft.\n\nCurrently, the stock price has been pretty stagnant but the P/E ratio is around 9, which is oddly low for a company that competes with AWS and Microsoft, in addition to providing more niche services. The P/B ratio is insanely good as well, with nearly $30B in assets, they are essentially a classic value stock. With recent announcements of partnerships and spin-offs with Dell, as well as rumors of acquisitions from Microsoft, this company is on a path to become the next Salesforce or at least a major acquisition.\n\nMy Rating: Strong Buy &amp; Hold\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n    Ticker: NYSE: VMW\n    Market Cap ~ $57B\n    Stock Price ~ $136\n    P/E Ratio ~ 9\n    P/B Ratio ~ 1.8\n    Next Earning Release Date: August 27th\n    Overview of VMware based on their recent documents: \n    VMware, Inc.

        "selftext": "Biotechnology stocks have been crushed due to pandemic. I wanted to share with you all a full DD for MNLO. I really believe this is a special stock.\n\nMNLO UPDATE 28 AUG 2020 \u2013 Talk with Menlo's CEO, CFO, CCO\n\n27 Aug 2020 call with Menlo (NASDAQ: MNLO)'s CEO (David Domzalski), CFO (Andrew Saik), CCO (Matt Wiley)\n\nDear All\n\nYesterday I had a one hour call with Menlo Therapeutics' CEO, CFO, CCO. The CEO said they appreciate my communications, insights, recommendations that I've been sending over the course of the past year (directly to management, since some of us investors consider Menlo's IR (commissioned to LifeSci) as non-existent.\n\nDave is a breath of fresh air compared to many biotech CEOs I've dealt with. Dave has it all: management skills, sales blood, soft skills, subject matter expertise, big mind. Andrew and Matt are also best-in-class :-)\n\nWe covered a lot of areas. I had 6 pages of questions. Here's a summary of my impressions. To be clear, I did not receive any insider information, and this is not an investment advice.\n\nMy background is not biotech (it's computer science, management, philosophy, music, law), but have been through thick and thin in biotech as an investor and seen first hand, and battled first hand, with the worst of unethical Wall Street, and kicked some ass in the process (e.g., in collaboration with FINRA).\n\nCurrent headcount is 100. It was 150 post merger. Some cuts due to Covid (not salesforce) mainly in overseas operations (future of small footprint unknown -- new legislation reduced tax benefit). They've migrated from an internal development model to partnerships/outsourcing so can dial-up/down easily (development, clinical trials). Salesforce consists of 65 people -- 51 reps, 6 managers, head of sales, and admin / marketing / managed care. The organization is lean (can probably be leaner).\n\nCowan issued a nice note (see below) after the latest prescription data titled \"Recent Amzeeq Rx Trends Are Gaining Nice Momentum And Are Cause For Optimism\". And a price target of $10/share. Current price: $1.43 !!\n\nCEO said they've seen a meaningful inflection in recent week and they're pleased with the progress [although it could have been a lot better if it wasn't for Covid-19].\n\nThe company receives weekly IMS data, as well as historical claims data for the entire dermatology space which helps them target with strategic planning, knowing location of patients, predictive modeling, etc.\n\nRevenue per script: it was anticipated that in the first couple of quarters the company would absorb a lot of the script costs. Coverage is increasing, the third and last PBM should be on board in Q4. Revenue per script should increase as coverage increases. In steady state it\u2019ll be a lot higher than last quarter's average. Net price per plan for payer is $200 to $400.\n\nI asked Matt about the post-Covid-outbreak market \u201chealing\u201d. He said it\u2019s going in the right direction. August should seasonally be a strong month. While scripts have grown, the bounce is not as much as it would have been without Covid19 -- but market is coming back in a reasonable way.\n\nReverse Stock Split: They had 90% shareholder approval and have a year to do it -- and think about it like I do -- that it should be done at a strategic time for maximum benefit. I've changed my mind about this topic in the last weeks -- I used the Arena model, but Arena hadn't just gone through a bloody merger before their reverse split. They're absolutely not under any pressure to do it (they are not desperate or need to do it). It will happen at the right time.Why max RSS ratio 7 and not 10? One of their main goals for the RSS is to get the share price to a level where some major funds can buy the shares. Some of those funds have a $7 min. Some even have a $10 min. If the conversion is too high, it reduces the size of the float too much and that reduces liquidity (my idea: though a fund can bid up the price to get in). The optimum float size is 30 to 40 mil shares.\n\nCapital Raise: CEO alluded that they're not looking to do a capital raise anytime soon. CFO said they have enough cash till end of 2021. And depending on Covid-19 effect, if sales are good, they may never need to do another raise.\n\nCompetition: They monitor competition closely and consider it in their planning. They\u2019re seeing what they saw in market research as well \u2013 that topical minocycline is very unique and therefore very disruptive (good). They monitor competition. If competition comes in, it creates \u201cnoise\u201d in the market (e.g. acne or rosacea), and noise is considered good in the branded market (helps boost demand). Amzeeq has a very good position in the market irrespective of any newcomers.\n\nDTC: DTC makes sense 6 to 9 month after launch so doctors have enough experience with the drug as new patients are coming to them. Covid changed that timeline. They\u2019re turning on various DTC channels in this and next quarter. Search trends on Amzeeq is not a reliable metric because most new patients don\u2019t know about the drug. So DTC terms help patient land on pages that help educate them about Amzeeq, e.g. acne treatment\u2026\n\nName Change: The sites of Foamix and Menlo are not fully integrated -- hard to interpret but my sense is they're looking at name change. It\u2019s not that expensive. They\u2019re aware of the baggage after the acquisition. They think about it. Of course they couldn\u2019t tell me if they will or not but I think it makes sense that they do it \u2013 and am guessing that they will. And I guess they will do it soon (as postlude to the merger). The CFO has been engaged in name changes before with bigger companies. For a smaller company like us it\u2019s a lot easier.\n\nOptions: Options market makers do not consult with the company \u2013 and the company is suppose to not be involved in that. So they don\u2019t know. I assume there will be options once we get through this transition.\n\nCash: Core of expenses in Q2 was 30.5M which was a big decrease. The huge burn in Q2 was related to working capital. At end of Q1 there was a huge accrued liability related to trials. We should not see any more quarterly burn rates like last quarter. They have cash till end of next year. If they hit their revenue targets we may never do another raise. Covid makes it hard to predict.\n\nCost savings: CEO said he sees it the same was as I that there\u2019s always room for belt tightening (best and most profitable companies still do that). Of course you need to spend money when you need to, but he assured me that they\u2019re mindful of operating efficiently, and running a lean organization, with focus on sales activity and launch. They're selective in their pipeline activity (good; I'm happy they don't start P3 for a while).\n\nBoard: We talked about the board of directors, my experience with Lazy-Boy(and Girl) board members in other biotechs. Also, executive management seems top heavy for the small pipeline. Encouraged CEO to be disruptive -- the Board needs him -- he's the boss and should call the shots, and cut, even at the very top. I'm totally for rightsizing, including the board.\n\nOpen market buys: CEO will convey message that we want to see Board members buy in open market. He said he likes the idea and is looking into it. Of course he's restricted by MNPI (material nonpublic info) constraints.\n\nStock action: They're not aware of any institution selling out -- they've asked about the stock action and feedback was it's mainly retail selling -- and probably related to automatic transaction (Stop Loss Orders) [where a market participant who sees a SL-order manipulates the price down to make the shareholder lose the shares at that manipulated low price -- a practice that can be unlawful -- in fact, I'm planning to make a report to my FINRA contacts to investigate it].\n\nInstitutions: They've had discussions with large institutional investors, and the feedback is supportive. Institutions have told them, continue to execute and it will work out. Those institutions know what they're talking about :-)\n\nRoadshow: We didn't specifically talk about that but I guess that there may be a road show to present the company to more institutions. Again, purely my guess: I think they will do a name change -- a reverse split -- launch in mid-Sep as they've said before -- and then it makes sense to get out there and promote the new company :-)\n\nTrust: I shared my experience in this field: Don't trust anybody on Wall Street -- and I know this from very high levels, that surprise is their enemy, and everything you say you will do and won't do can be used against you. So confidentiality is key. And of course, under-promise, over-deliver. And integrity and truthfulness is most important (which they have). Wall Street, as dishonest as it is, punishes management it cannot trust. Also it's documented that some big pharmas which want to buy a small company have engaged in manipulating the stock down. I am happy Dave grasps all these.\n\nPartnership: Cutia partnership: how did they find you? Cutia came to us via their parent organization. They found us. That's awesome :-) -- Dave was only interested if there was a good up front payment. Forget these deals with promises for later. Cash is king now (my words). Very low risk transaction. Small market. Nice up front payment. They will commercialize in China etc. in the future.\n\nEU, CH: They have had and continue to have discussions. The deal just has to make sense. They won't go alone (of course). Main focus in US. But license partner in Ex-US makes sense.\n\nAlliance Management: Is part of the legal group. Not a dedicated person. Makes sense. They are small co, and wear many hats.\n\nFair Value: What price would you consider for a buyout? This triggered an interesting discussion with Andrew talking about his model for calculating fair value based on peak revenue expectation, but of course, they wouldn't give me a number. But I did some calculations myself -- if you take a couple of drugs at a couple of hundred million peak sale each, you get something like $21 / share which makes analyst estimates conservative.\n\nBuyout: They're open to consider any compelling offer. They're not out shopping the company. They're focused on building the company. I have a sense that a buyer will step up with a compelling offer. I bluntly asked if there's been any interest. That put them into a limbo and a laughing session ensued. Of course I knew they couldn't answer. One commented that they're usually asked that in face-to-face meetings. I said I can read minds even on the phone ;-) -- and the CEO remarked that he likes my style :-)\n\nLeo Pharma: Rumor is they may be a buyer. My sense is that Leo has a lot on their hand and I don't think they're not The one (just my guess). They have a good relationship.\n\nGave them some feedback on some things, e.g., company presentation, e.g. dominance of while old men with beard that's not our patient space ... anyway I think / hope they will revamp company's IR / PR... and other topics.\n\nIR: We discussed IR at length. They're aware of the concerns and looking at it... I think dedication is very important -- even if it's an internal person who is 30% dedicated to it. Current model with LifeSci seems very expensive and ineffective. Zeno works project based.\n\nOverall, I sensed a lot of confidence in them. COWAN'S NOTE\n\nMenlo Therapeutics (NASDAQ: MNLO)\n\nOutperform\n\nPrice Target: $10.00\n\nRecent Amzeeq Rx Trends Are Gaining Nice Momentum And Are Cause For Optimism\n\nThe Cowen Insight\n\nThe Amzeeq launch was solid up until the pandemic-driven office closures. However, recent Rx trends show a nice recovery/inflection, and with the broadening payor coverage, it does appear that Amzeeq is back on track. With Amzeeq setting a nice foundation, Zilxi for rosacea (Q4 launch) should further leverage. We continue to believe combined Amzeeq/Zilxi sales could eventually exceed $500MM+.\n\nAlthough the pandemic has had an obvious impact on what was, by any objective measure, a solid initial Amzeeq launch, we believe management now has this critical franchise back on track. Notably, Amzeeq prescriptions are inflecting, with the most recent weekly figures (via both IQVIA and Symphony) showing levels that exceed the pre-pandemic highs, and nicely ahead of our expectations.For perspective, utilizing the most recent weekly total Rx figures and a normalized pricing of roughly $200-250 per Rx would suggest an annualized run-rate of $30-35MM, which is an encouraging recovery post the most onerous part of the pandemic. And with most target physician practices now open (90%+), we believe this Amzeeq momentum should continue, and will soon be leveraged by the Zilxi Q4 launch.\n\nAmzeeq Prescription Trajectory\n\nRecall, Amzeeq launched in January, and despite the pandemic setback, management has already secured roughly 65% commercial lives and should reach 80% by Q4. We believe this underscores Menlo's pragmatic pricing strategy for Amzeeq that should allow for broad coverage to capture of meaningful volumes while still maintaining a healthy $200-250 prescription value (note, management continues to indicate that value per Rx should trend in the $200-400 range although we are using the lower end for conservatism). Our conversations with other dermatology industry participants indicate that they believe this volume-based pricing strategy that will allow for broad coverage makes complete sense given the size of the potential market, and should allow for constructive payor negotiations for Zilxi. And lastly, it does appear that the number of unique prescribers has continued to grow despite the pandemic (to 4,200), another very positive metric this early in its launch.",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 24th, 2020.\n\n# **Markets look to the Fed again to build on S&amp;P 500 record as Congress continues to disappoint  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/21/markets-look-to-the-fed-again-to-build-on-sp-500-record-as-congress-continues-to-disappoint.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Market pros hold out little hope that Congress will agree to a stimulus package before September, but they will look to Jerome Powell in the coming week to provide a roadmap for what else the Fed might do to help the economy.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed holds its annual Jackson Hole symposium starting Thursday, and it will conduct the Kansas City Fed-sponsored meeting virtually rather than against the backdrop of the Grand Tetons as it normally does at this time of year. The Fed chairman speaks Thursday morning on the implications for monetary policy and the Fed\u2019s anticipated policy framework review.\n*****\n&gt; The past week was a big week for markets, with the S&amp;P 500 finally recovering its losses from the pandemic selloff and setting new all-time highs. Stocks have been big beneficiaries of the Fed\u2019s easy policies and low interest rates, and Fed officials are widely expected to sound dovish when they meet in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think we know the Fed\u2019s all in. If anything they want the mechanicals to work right,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cThe basic Fed policy is crystal clear. You\u2019re going to have low rates for the foreseeable future. They will do whatever it takes.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But Fed watchers expect Powell to go further than the Fed\u2019s already extraordinary support for the economy and financial conditions, and offer guidance on new language and policies that will help the markets understand how long it might hold those low rates and extraordinary policies in place.\n*****\n&gt; For instance, the Fed was expected to provide a more explicit forward guidance policy, and it could also introduce inflation averaging, meaning the Fed could specify that it could both undershoot and overshoot its 2% inflation target. Inflation has only occasionally surpassed its target over the past dozen years, since the financial crisis.\n*****\n&gt; Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays, said he expects the Fed will introduce forward guidance and average inflation targeting at its September meeting. He expects the Fed\u2019s policy review to examine all of its policies to determine which work best in different circumstances.\n*****\n&gt; Since the markets collapsed in February and March, the Fed has cut rates to zero and helped increase liquidity with different facilities for different areas of the capital markets like commercial paper, municipal bonds and corporate bonds. It also created lending programs and continues to buy a large amount of Treasury securities and mortgages. Its balance sheet has now ballooned to $7 trillion.\n*****\n&gt; With average inflation targeting, the Fed would allow the economy and inflation to run hotter than target, without immediately taking steps to tighten policy, according to Jim Caron, fixed income portfolio manger with Morgan Stanley Investment Management.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat they\u2019re saying is if the economy starts to recover, let\u2019s say we get a vaccine, or the rate of infection goes down, and the equity market is on a tear, they\u2019re not going to stop it,\u201d said Caron. \u201cThey\u2019re going to stay there for awhile. That\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to communicate.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Where\u2019s the stimulus?\n&gt; As markets await clarity from the Fed, market pros are expecting less from Congress after first initially anticipating a stimulus package by early August.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAt this point, the thing I\u2019m most thinking about is are we going to get a stimulus deal or not,\u201d said Keon. \u201cI think the politics are shifting beneath that.\u201d He said some Republicans in Congress may be less inclined to spend on a big package ahead of the election.\n*****\n&gt; Democrats and Republicans have been far apart in terms of the contents of the package. One hot button issue is the $600 supplemental weekly aid for the unemployed. It expired on July 31, and Republicans want to cut it to $200 a week while Democrats want to keep current levels. The White House meanwhile has moved to provide $300 a week in aid from FEMA funds but the states have to process those payments.\n*****\n&gt; The two parties are also still far apart on the size of the package, after initially starting out with Democrats at $3 trillion and Republicans with $1 trillion.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cSome folks are discovering their inner budget hawks. It looks like the positions of the two sides are moving further away rather than closer together,\u201d said Keon. \u201cAs the election moves up on us, the possibilities of a deal are going down...the markets are slowly moving toward the idea we don\u2019t get stimulus deal and we might get a Biden presidency. It\u2019s not panicking about it.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The Democratic party held its convention this past week, formally nominating former vice president Joseph Biden to head the Democratic ticket. The Republican convention begins Monday. Biden leads President Donald Trump by an average 7.4 percentage points in the major polls, according to RealClearPolitics.com.\n*****\n&gt; Michael Schumacher, director rate strategy at Wells Fargo, said he too is becoming more skeptical a stimulus deal will get done. \u201cAs the election season gets going, it appears to be getting harder and harder, not from a timing standpoint but from a lack of goodwill standpoint,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said if the economic data weakens, that could hurt stocks and get Congress back to negotiating a new package. There had been expectations a package would include a one-time payment for individuals and families, enhanced unemployment payments and aid for state and local governments.\n*****\n&gt; Raymond James Washington policy analyst Ed Mills said the two sides are likely to come together, but without a catalyst forcing them it may wait until they need to pass a continuing resolution on the budget Sept. 30. \u201cDemocrats are not going to allow for an appropriations bill to pass that does not include additional support for the economy,\u201d said Mills.\n*****\n&gt; # It\u2019s the economy\n&gt; There is some key data in the week ahead that should show how manufacturing and the consumer are faring.\n*****\n&gt; Durable good is reported Wednesday, while personal income and spending data is reported Friday. Consumer confidence is Tuesday and consumer sentiment is released Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Energy markets will be keeping a close eye on two tropical storms that are heading into the Gulf of Mexico and could make landfall early Wednesday. One storm, Laura is tracking close to Florida, and a second storm, possibly to be named Marco looks to be heading across the Yucatan Peninsula before entering the Gulf.\n*****\n&gt; It would be unprecedented in the era of satellites and modern hurricane tracking technology for two storms to arrive within 24 hours. The Weather Channel reports there was such an occurrence in September, 1933.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/0FgKliy.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/yHvkn2w.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/L2S9kUV.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/kgk42Nv.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cMOmbjC.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kCvYfYX.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jwR8nq6.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nSC6K2N.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/YSNdrT9T/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/bwcCQMYv/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/yxfJ72fy/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/3Nr453Zw/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # September Almanac: Only Modest Improvement in Election Years\n\n&gt; Start of business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Sizable gains in September 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2017 have lifted Russell 2000 to second worst (since 1979). September was creamed four years straight from 1999-2002 after four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble buildup.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e4e433c87c6e4c76cefda4ccffbf5ab0/cfdd6d36ba180c35-7f/s400x600/836cc65ffaba5c46d56ea4566614d200638be344.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Bullish election-year forces do little to improve on September\u2019s poor overall performance over the same time frame. September\u2019s performance does improve slightly in election years, but it is still negative nearly across the board. Only the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have been able to escape negative territory and post modest 0.2% and 0.8% average gains respectively in the last ten election year Septembers.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5 Charts To See With Stocks At New Highs\n\n&gt; \u201cBetter late than never.\u201d\n\n&gt; It took a while, but the S&amp;P 500 Index finally made a new all-time high, coming all the way back from the vicious 34% bear market in less than six months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pic-8.19.20-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It might bring back some scary memories, but back in March it took the S&amp;P 500 only 16 days to go from new highs to a bear market (down 20%), the fastest ever.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThis will go down as the fastest bear market ever, but also one of the fastest recoveries ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThen again, we\u2019ve never quite seen a recession and recovery like this, so maybe it isn\u2019t a shock to see new highs this quickly.\u201d\n\n&gt; The bear officially lasted one month and took five months to recover the losses. Usually when there\u2019s a bear market during a recession, it takes 30 months to recover those loses. This was the third-fastest ever, with only 3 months to recover from a bear market recession in the early \u201880s and 4 months to recover from a bear market in the early \u201890s.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It seems like earlier this year and new highs were a lifetime ago, but the S&amp;P 500 finally moved off unlucky 13, notching the 14th new high of 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, returns after a long time without new highs actually get better. One, three, six, and 12 months after the first new high in more than five months show stronger performance than average or after any new highs. Yet another reason to think that this bull market from a long-term point of view could have some more tricks up its sleeve.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Last, we found there were four other times the S&amp;P 500 made a new high during a recession: In February \u201961, July \u201980, November \u201982, and March \u201991. Incredibly, a new expansion started the following month every single time. Could stocks at new highs be signaling an end to this recession? We think that very well could be the case again this time.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Largest S&amp;P 500 Stocks + Tesla (TSLA)\n\n&gt; Tesla (TSLA) is now up 50% over the last 10 calendar days dating back to August 11th. This has propelled the company way up the list of the largest US companies.\n\n&gt; Below is a table of the largest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 with Tesla (TSLA) included. As shown, Tesla's $382.7 billion market cap would rank it as the 9th largest stock in the S&amp;P 500 were it in the index.\n\n&gt; On August 11th, Tesla's market cap was just $256 billion, so over the last ten days it has leapfrogged companies like Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), JP Morgan (JPM), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Mastercard (MA), and NVIDIA (NVDA). Next up would be Visa (V) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), which have market caps just under $400 billion.

Tips - Earnings Season and Top Triple Plays\n\n&gt; Walmart (WMT) wrapped up the Q2 2020 earnings reporting period on Tuesday with a huge beat on both the top and bottom line. It was a fitting end to what turned out to be a record-setting earnings season.\n\n&gt; As we highlighted in our Q2 Earnings Season preview in early July, analysts were rapidly increasing earnings estimates leading up to earnings season. Normally when that happens, stocks have trouble performing well during earnings season because the expectations bar has been set higher. This season, even with analyst estimates on the rise in the four weeks leading up to the start of the reporting period, companies managed to beat bottom-line EPS estimates at the highest rate in the history of our database going back to 1999.\n\n&gt; As shown below, 76% of companies reported stronger-than-expected EPS numbers this season, which eclipsed the prior record high of 73% seen during the Q3 2006 reporting period.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/beatratesbyquarter.png))**\n\n&gt; Long-term Bespoke subscribers know how much we like earnings triple plays, but for those that haven\u2019t heard of the term, we came up with it back in the mid-2000s. An earnings triple play is a company that beats EPS estimates, beats revenue estimates, and raises forward guidance all in the same quarterly earnings report. Investopedia.com is one of the best online resources for financial markets education, and they\u2019ve actually given us credit for coining the \u201ctriple play\u201d term on their website. We consider triple play stocks to be the cream of the crop of earnings season, and we are constantly finding new long-term buy opportunities from this basket of names each quarter.\n\n&gt; This earnings season there were a massive number of earnings triple plays. We went through the list of this season's triple plays to find the ones that have the most attractive set-ups heading into the earnings off-season.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending August 21st, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGhxT3rxKxc))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 8.23.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCwfvNh2iXU))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$BBY** \n&gt; * **$DG** \n&gt; * **$CRM** \n&gt; * **$DLTR** \n&gt; * **$INTU** \n&gt; * **$DKS** \n&gt; * **$MDT** \n&gt; * **$PANW** \n&gt; * **$SJM** \n&gt; * **$ICLK** \n&gt; * **$OKTA** \n&gt; * **$MRVL** \n&gt; * **$ADSK** \n&gt; * **$HRL** \n&gt; * **$WDAY** \n&gt; * **$BIG** \n&gt; * **$COTY** \n&gt; * **$ULTA** \n&gt; * **$BOX** \n&gt; * **$SPLK**\n&gt; * **$BNS** \n&gt; * **$TOL** \n&gt; * **$VMW** \n&gt; * **$BMO** \n&gt; * **$TD** \n&gt; * **$VEEV** \n&gt; * **$HPE** \n&gt; * **$DELL** \n&gt; * **$BILI** \n&gt; * **$BURL** \n&gt; * **$PLCE** \n&gt; * **$ANF** \n&gt; * **$OLLI** \n&gt; * **$PLAN** \n&gt; * **$FLWS** \n&gt; * **$VIOT** \n&gt; * **$RY** \n&gt; * **$HPQ** \n&gt; * **$SOL** \n&gt; * **$BITA** \n&gt; * **$ATHM** \n&gt; * **$NTAP**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/YSNdrT9T/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/FKXPQh9j/ervol1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST INCREASE IN EARNINGS EXPECTATIONS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/G3q2ZwT4/erincrease1.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.24.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RwgQ9SD.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/mvBOGth.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.25.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/aY6k2e0.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.25.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/rx2gJbQ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.26.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/zKSTcN5.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.26.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/B3hFxJN.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.27.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wqQ6cS6.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Tln4z5V.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.28.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7xetbo6.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.28.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best Buy Co., Inc. $114.00\n&gt; **Best Buy Co., Inc.

Their stock has been flying under the radar for a long time, mostly due to the technical nature of their products and services. Since most of their products are the backbone to a lot of the cloud services businesses &amp; consumers use and given the recent push towards cloud and digital transformation because of coronavirus, they have stated in earnings call that they expect increased demand and continuous growth. At the very least, their stock should follow the same trajectory of other cloud service providers such as Microsoft.\n\nCurrently, the stock price has been pretty stagnant but the P/E ratio is around 9, which is oddly low for a company that competes with AWS and Microsoft, in addition to providing more niche services. The P/B ratio is insanely good as well, with nearly $30B in assets, they are essentially a classic value stock. With recent announcements of partnerships and spin-offs with Dell, as well as rumors of acquisitions from Microsoft, this company is on a path to become the next Salesforce or at least a major acquisition.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was wondering if this has come across anyone else's radar and if anyone knows why the PE ratio is this low?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n    Ticker: NYSE: VMW Market Cap ~ $57B\n    Stock Price ~ $136\n    P/E Ratio ~ 9\n    P/B Ratio ~ 1.8\n    Next Earning Release Date: August 27th\n    Overview of VMware based on their recent documents:\n    VMware, Inc.

While we all enjoy epic loss porn when it happens to someone else, personally, I'd rather be winning.\n\nInstead of throwing money away based on another degenerate's writing skills, how about backing up bets with knowledge of what the big money is doing *right now*? Still gamble in the WSB casino, but increase the odds of winning by betting *with* that flow. \n\nI've been using [TradeIV](https://tradeiv.com/) to keep an eye on the real-time options sweeps, and yesterday afternoon I saw an alert for the CRM 9/4 240c. Seemed like a bold move to put $125k on, so I looked at the other CRM sweeps, and the sentiment was strongly bullish for the weeks post-earnings. Also checked the other 9/4 options on TOS, and noticed crazy volume on the 250c, so I threw some money at it without more thought.\n\nThat turned into a 9 bagger when I sold at open today (I know... could have been 25x if I waited an hour): \n\n[https://imgur.com/YiKl0CB](https://imgur.com/YiKl0CB)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWSB DD is great for ideas, but anytime a post seems interesting, I've started checking the sweeps to see which direction the big boy bets are going.\n\nFB 9/18 300c that I bought on 8/19 and still hold (up 900%) is another example. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - Do 60 seconds of research before lighting your money on fire.

        "selftext": "New to investing and realizing I should diversify my portfolio a bit by adding more stocks. I currently hold LVGO/AYX and have enjoyed success looking for smaller (under 10B) subscription based service companies with good management and a large TAM. \n\nMy question is what other companies are out there that are worth researching and potentially investing into the growth story? I am currently watching a few (don\u2019t all meet my criteria above). \n\n- NCINO: I like that Salesforce is a buyer and a leading investor. Was waiting for the price to dip below 70. \n\n- PINS: Speculative TAM play and I like the concept of being able to buy what\u2019s pinned. Missed the rip this week and it\u2019s ~20B now. \n\n- LMND: Really likes this company at first and was going to buy sub 60. But the more I read about it the more I think they\u2019re going to get eaten alive and the real play in this space is a company that either doesn\u2019t exist, or adapts. I think of it like Rocket Mortgage, but still in its infancy and too weak too defend its position. \n\n- Palantir: Hasn\u2019t IPO\u2019d yet and I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s chart post IPO is more like Livongo than what we\u2019ve been seeing recently with the share price doubled at open. \n\nWhat else should I be looking at?",

While other large cap tech/WFH stocks like $DDOG, $CHGG, $SNAP, $ZM reached new ATH, $WORK had been sitting quietly at the sidelines just watching the scene unfold. \n\nRecently, the stocks that saw major selloffs post ER last ER release, notably, $CRM and $BOX, are seeing massive upticks. $WORK too was one of the stocks that had major run-ups but was followed by major selloffs post ER due to the lack of guidance despite beating analysts\u2019 forecast. \n\nThis time around, it will be different. $WORK was seeing mostly red the last few months, but that all changed this week. It\u2019s showing so much activity consistently with high volume. \n\nI\u2019m not here to assess the fundamentals of $WORK, but the bigger institutional investors are loading up on these bad boys probably for that same reason: It\u2019s underpriced. I think you guys can safely get in this as it will see massive strides leading up to the ER.",

        "selftext": "Social Media Feed-Based Trading\nScanning real-time social media feeds from known sources and trusted market participants is another emerging trend in automated trading. It involves a predictive analysis of social media content to make trading decisions and place trade orders. For example, assume Paul is a reputed market maker for three known stocks. His dedicated social media feed contains real-time tips for his three stocks. Market participants, who trust Paul for his trading acumen, can pay to subscribe to his private real-time feed. His updates are fed into computer algorithms that analyze and interpret them for content and even for the tone used in the language of the update. Along with Paul, there can be several other trusted participants, who share tips on a particular stock. The algorithm aggregates all the updates from different trusted sources, analyzes them for trading decisions, and finally places the trade automatically. Combining social media feed analysis with other inputs like news analysis and quarterly results can lead to a complex, but reliable way to sense the mood of the market on a particular stock\u2019s movement.\n\n\n\n\n[Cash](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/081215/new-alternatives-highfrequency-trading.asp)\n\n\n\n\n[evidence ](https://youtu.be/cNWshKyfHBg)\n\n\nWhat Is Quote Stuffing?\nQuote stuffing is the practice of quickly entering and then withdrawing large orders in an attempt to flood the market with quotes, causing competitors to lose time in processing them.\n\nUnderstanding Quote Stuffing\nQuote stuffing was coined by Eric Scott Hunsader, founder of financial data company Nanex, and is a strategy that high frequency traders (HFT) use to gain a pricing edge over competitors. It is made possible by high-frequency trading programs that can execute market actions with incredible speed\u2014generating hundreds or thousands of orders per second. High frequency trading is now estimated to account for at least 50% of total market volume. These programs allow HFTs to make money by arbitrage: exploring temporary pricing efficiencies before others have time to notice and/or react to them.\n\n\n\nWith now tiktok level data they execute trades even better than before your tendies are in Trouble if there is another flash crash it might be terribly bad \n\n\n\nPOSITIONS OR BAN\n+2 CRM 192.50 call 8/28\n+25 ARKK  3/19/21",

        "selftext": "**Context -**\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 (+0.4%) and Nasdaq Composite (+0.8%) rose to record highs today. The market found continued support in the mega-caps following a disappointing consumer confidence report.\n\nConference Board's Consumer Confidence Index dropped to 84.8 in August (consensus 93.0) from 91.7 in July for its lowest reading since May 2014.\n\nPresumably, there were some concerns that the decline in consumer confidence would translate to less consumer spending, absent another round of fiscal stimulus. In addition, the report overshadowed new home sales showing a marked increase of 13.9% m/m in July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 901,000 (consensus 787,000).\n\nAmazon (AMZN 3346.49, +39.03, +1.2%), Facebook (FB 280.82, +9.43, +3.5%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1608.22, +20.02, +1.3%), which have performed well throughout the pandemic, posted strong gains after a slow start. Apple (AAPL 499.30, -4.13, -0.8%) was a notable exception.\n\nIn key stock news, Salesforce (CRM 216.05, +7.59, +3.6%), Amgen (AMGN 248.22, +12.65, +5.4%), and Honeywell (HON 164.53, +5.16, +3.2%) will replace Exxon Mobil (XOM 40.89, -1.33, -3.2%), Pfizer (PFE 38.41, -0.43, -1.1%), and Raytheon Technologies (RTX 60.95, -0.93, -1.5%) in the Dow 30 average prior to the open on Aug. 31.\n\nThe change was enacted to account for Apple's 4:1 stock split, as its lower price would reduce the price-weighted Dow's exposure to the technology sector.\n\nThe U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.3% to 93.01. WTI crude futures rose 1.7%, or $0.72, to $43.33/bbl.\n\nInvestors will receive Durable Goods Orders for July and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.\n\n**Index Summary -**\n\nS&amp;P 500 +0.35%; Nasdaq +0.79%;\n\nDOW -0.2%; Russell 2000 +0.11%\n\nVIX: 22.03 -0.34,( -1.52%)\n\n**Sector Summary -**\n\n*The three highest sectors for today were :*\n\nCommunication Services +0.94%; Health Care +0.68%; Information Technology +0.5%;\n\n*The three lowest sectors for today were :*\n\nEnergy -1.41%; Utilities -0.95%; Materials -0.4%;\n\n**Commodities -**\n\nGold - 1933.1,( -0.31%); Crude - 42.79,( +0.4%)\n\n*Today\u2019s Option Activity Fast Facts -*\n\n**CBOE Put/Call Ratio -** 0.42\n\n***Highest Multiple Over Daily Average -*** TOL with 15 x the ADV of 4294.

        "selftext": "**The Case for Zuora: The Growth Stock of a Lifetime**\n\nZuora focuses on one, simple to understand niche; cloud software to enable subscription-based services. A subscription-based model is one in which a business may lend or sell goods based on recurrent payments made at decided intervals. Now as you may be able to tell based on news, ads, or generally being a consumer this is a fast-growing and competitive environment where almost all sectors are participating in, and the model has existed since the early 17th century when book publishers had used these platforms to generate consistent revenues from their most loyal readers. The CEO of Zuora believes their product is like CRM for a subscription-based economy: \u201cCRM and ERP systems, however, were designed for products, not for companies with subscription business models. In a world where every customer is now a subscriber, companies must adopt new technology to manage the entire subscriber lifecycle, including new subscriber acquisition, subscription management (i.e. enabling subscribers to upgrade, downgrade, renew and otherwise modify their subscriptions), automating recurring billing and payments, and measuring recurring revenue and subscription metrics\u201d, and in a basic sense this would make Zuora a fintech company, like Square (SQ) or even Rocket Companies (RKT) via automating billing solutions, but Zuora also provides analytics for subscription-based producers such as market trends and relation analysis with subscribers. Zuora\u2019s RevPro accounting and revenue solution aims to \u201cMeet compliance for the latest revenue standards and accelerate your time to close\u201d, and in this subscription-based economy, that efficiency will mean everything. Automating accounting, CRM, sales and marketing, and product management make Zuora the one-stop-shop for SaaS companies like Zoom, DocuSign, and BetterCloud. Considering their new partnership with GoCardless ([Zuora and GoCardless Expand Partnership to Revolutionize Global Subscription Payments](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zuora-gocardless-expand-partnership-revolutionize-120000704.html)) and the growing subscription based economy ([More Than Half Of US Households Now Subscribe To Multiple Streaming Services \u2013 Study](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/more-half-u-households-now-153943744.html)), ZUO only has room to grow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pzbb3gi98tj51.png?width=270&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f46a7fd639c23e5a8fceb93dc307af23e770a60c\n\nIn terms of financials, Zuora has recently increased spending and debt, which is sort of a natural phase for growth stocks like them, but it can be a bit concerning\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/niysykaa8tj51.png?width=707&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=058d6968afb61aa097ee7b8668ab9b0617a748ac\n\nBut as you can also see here, they are consistently generating revenue directly as a result of their tie-ups with SaaS based platforms, and yes the below costs are going up but a majority of them have to do with levering and increased R&amp;D\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/soh7l37b8tj51.png?width=516&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f531d19bb6ff45fda35734b9c446ebb57412e6f0\n\nBut I wouldn\u2019t concern myself with any of these effects as they are common out of growth stocks like ZUO which are constantly seeking out newer opportunities and require more financing. The best part of all this is that SG&amp;A is going down because they are becoming a well-known competitor and service in this space, and almost any other company in this space will look the same financially\n\nMost of their assets are not financed by long term debt, so this will bring a great peace of mind to traditional investors who think debt is evil:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bs7jetbc8tj51.png?width=627&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a90570d8cc60ddfd19d4efee26523b21e96c2d1\n\nAnd sales have increased so much, that the P/S ratio is lower than it was when the share prices peaked\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l0x6omld8tj51.png?width=630&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a672cef076826a2f21d0c8b0bf7f3204053dfb60\n\nAnd most importantly, FCF has increased which means that the company\u2019s financial structure has allowed for more retention of cash, something that can be necessary when you\u2019re a fledgling company in a volatile and competitive market space.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tb6xi3ue8tj51.png?width=429&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa52548832bf7189ad7566c3df7a8584ca2f25e8\n\nOn top of that, gross profit margins are finally turning around for this year, and should continue to increase for the future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9s0d33pf8tj51.png?width=466&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28782f6bd56f557c9a6e258e9cf7c738753da345\n\nPeople are moving further and further away from owning goods which is why we\u2019ve seen the rise in SaaS and PaaS, even from companies like Caterpillar who make industrial equipment for construction and mining, we\u2019ve seen revolutions in how we can be efficient with products and services, and companies like AirBnB and Turo have shown us the consumer mentality going forward. Caterpillar uses Zuora software to manage and interact with those who rent their machinery by installing sensors into the engines of trucks themselves to monitor fuel usage and tow haul, this gives them a better idea of what the consumer needs and makes an immediate impact on future engineering plans, so now even seemingly traditional industries have shifted their focus to subscription planning and management digitally. [https://www.thestreet.com/investing/zuoras-ceo-were-seeing-greater-interest-in-subscription-business-models-tien-tzuo?puc=yahoo&amp;cm\\_ven=YAHOO](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/zuoras-ceo-were-seeing-greater-interest-in-subscription-business-models-tien-tzuo?puc=yahoo&amp;cm_ven=YAHOO), in this interview the CEO of Zuora had to say this about their impact on the economy during covid: \u201c\"Absolutely. And that\u2019s what really excites us. Companies are...saying, \u2018Thank god we\u2019re a subscription business. Thank god we have the resiliency. We can\u2019t imagine managing through this current situation not as a subscription business. We\u2019re not seeing 50, 60, 70%, overnight drops in revenue, that\u2019s just not happening.'\n\nAnd even \\[among\\] the companies that are being adversely impacted by the current environment, they\u2019re shrinking, but they\u2019re shrinking slowly. They\u2019re doing a good job of hanging onto their subscriber bases\u201d,\n\nI\u2019m confident this company will outperform long and short term, and the fact that they\u2019ve picked out just one area to operate in will make it easier for them in the long term as well, and we\u2019ll see costs and debt be cut in the future so that retained earnings and EBITDA can increase causing more market interest in ZUO.\n\n\\*\\*Tl;dr ZUO calls for October/November (16c) , shares and LEAPs as deep as u want ;)",

        "selftext": "Taser and police body camera manufacturer, **Axon Enterprise** $AAXN jumped on Tuesday after several announcements that show the company is continually developing new products;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- a new artificial intelligence tool which will allow police to \"use artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate the review and transcription of evidence, generating significant time and cost saving benefits for agencies.\"\n\n\\- \"a new real-time operations platform ... to connect dispatch, patrol officers, field sergeants and tactical officers\" that it is calling \"Axon Respond.\"\n\n\\- a partnership with Fotokite to provide \"live-streamed footage within Axon's digital evidence management solution, Axon Evidence.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith a market cap of $5.4bn Axon has become the trusted go to provider for tasers and police evidence solutions.  Signing up Axon is the safe bet for police departments in a market that Axon has conservatively estimated at $8.4 billion (excluding opportunities in US federal law enforcement, international Axon Fleet, and prisons and corrections).  Recent results and developments suggest the actual TAM is probably a lot larger.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[**Salesforce.com**](https://Salesforce.com) $CRM shares were sharply higher in late trading Tuesday after the company\u2019s fiscal second-quarter results thrashed Wall Street\u2019s estimates with revenue of $5.15 billion, up 29% from a year ago.  Trading on a valuation of 11x revenues and almost 100x EPS I would expect as much.  For the full year, the company forecasts revenue of $20.7 billion to $20.8 billion, with non-GAAP profits of $3.72 to $3.74 a share compared to estimates projecting $20.1 billion revenues and $2.96 a share.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn a much more reasonable valuation (TTM PE 13.34), **Toll Brothers** $TOL also beat expectations in its Q3 with EPS of $0.90 and sales of $1.65bn versus forecasts of $0.71 and $1.5bn.  The company pointed to growing demand, driven by historically low interest rates, the undersupply of homes, and the COVID pandemic leading to consumers focusing on the importance of a home \u201cmore than ever.\u201d  Forward looking gauges \u2014 pending sales, housing starts and building permits \u2014 suggest that, against all odds, the US housing market is holding up. However the FT Lex points to timber prices, which have more than doubled, as a headwind for the sector.  Framing timber, along with installation, accounts for nearly a fifth of the cost of a house, according to the National Association of Home Builders. Thats going to hit margins.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally **BigCommerce Holdings** $BIGC spiked 37% after the company announced that its e-commerce checkout service would be available through Facebook's Instagram app.  The app allows consumers to check out on Instagram, instead of leaving the app and going to a merchant's website to finalize an e-commerce sale and could help merchants (who sign up) more easily sell their products to Instagram\u2019s 1 billion  users.  It could also help BigCommerce get a foot in the door with merchants before going on to cross sell other products and build their online store (similar to Shopify). \n\n \n\nShopify shareholders don\u2019t seem too worried just yet.  Shopify is about 15x larger by sales, cashflow positive and building out a fulfilment network that could end up challenging Amazon.  Nevertheless, it\u2019s a huge development for $BIGC who, with a market cap of just $7bn, are still at an early stage of growth with a long runway in front of them.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not a recommendation to buy or sell.  Stocks are not suitable for everyone.  Some of the stocks mentioned are risky small cap and/or highly speculative.  Please do your own research.",
