        "selftext": "The reason palantir was down recently was due to lockup expiration, which happened on Feb 18.\n\nEarly investors and employees that hold their shares for over a decade was able to sell portion of their shares to buy their new shiny car, house, and/or other reasons, had already done so. This create a very healthy pullback.\n\nNow is your chance to pick up the best long term AI and data analytic company with the biggest moat in tech.\n\nConsider these factors:\n\n\\-High Growth in the hottest AI and data analytic industry with a lot of IP.\n\n\\-Very low debt with $2 billion hand in hand.\n\n\\-Very high Gross Margin and Operating margin that keep going up as revenue increase at the same time, means that are really well run and they'll be very profitable in the future. They would have made a profit of $170million from the last 2 quarters if it wasn't for stock-based compensations.\n\n\\-Sticky customers that include governments and big expertises.\n\n\\-Limitless use case across almost any industry. Help BP become greener. Aid in cancer research. Help prevent wildfire in california. Help distribute the vaccine for covid-19. Help prevent future pandemic and disasters. Basically limitless use cases that help any corporation or government run large amount of data to discover the truth behind their data.\n\n\\-Palantir create disruptive future software that is ready for prime time and only recently started to get adopted by large corporation.\n\n\\-Great leadership\n\n\\-Cream of the crop employees. Beat out all of the FANNG companies.\n\n\\-No real competitors. Huge moat. One of the co-founder is Peter Thiel, also a co-founder of Paypal, and the author of \"Zero to One\". Where his philosophy is  always \"aim for monopoly, competition is for losers \".\n\n\\-Very forward looking. They create technology not for the past, but for the future need. Karp, their CEO said their goal is to become the world most \"important software company\" in the future.\n\n\\- They are able to create test simulation on your whole companies to see how different components affect your overall business from top to bottom and see how one change can affect the entire organization.\n\n\\-Create massive value for their clients by saving cost and becoming more efficient.\n\n\\-Allow any employees from your organization to make meaningful contribution without hiring costly data scientist that only perform ad-hoc task.\n\n\\-SaaS with apollo. Apollo allow SasS to be in almost anything like a submarine, with little or unstable internet connection, harsh environments, humvees, and etc. Before Apollo everything is frozen in time with old and unsecured legacy preinstalled software.\n\n\\- Interactive and easy to use user interface that is customizable to whatever you want.\n\n\\-Can be integrated with private cloud, AWS, google cloud, hybrid cloud, etc.\n\n\\-Highest level security trusted by the government.\n\n\\-They can now massively scale their services.\n\n\\-Significantly reduced their deployment from Months down to Hours and Days.\n\n\\-Ontology create a overview and blueprint of the entire organization and see how each component interact in real-time.\n\n\\-Modular of their foundry software for small and mid-size business\n\n\\-Recent partnership with IBM increase palantir's Sales force from less than 30 to over 2000. Palantir was able to grow to \\~1 Billion annually revenue with virtually no salespeople before 2020.\n\n\\-no code, abstract away time consuming processes, saving organization from hiring costly computer scientist, giving business managers/executive with no coding background, no CS degree, or no data science degree ability to contribute and make meaning decisions from the bottom up. Just like Windows did for the personal PC, Palantir is doing it for data analytics and AI. This is a big deal. The next frontier of technology after data analytics and AI, It is going to be bigger than the internet.\n\n\\-Allow data from different silos and types to flow in real-time to make better decisions. What life have taught me is that making the right decision at the right time is the most important thing in the world.\n\n\\-Constantly adding new features and making improvements to existing product line. Foundry for business was only released in a couple years ago and Apollo was only released in 2020, but it already made significant impact on their up and bottom line.\n\n\\- There is no doubt that big data analytics and AI is next technology that is going starting to go mainstream and is going to be a big game changers and will create massive wealth for first adaptors because it is a winner takes all market.\n\nThe progress of technology:\n\nInternet-&gt;Personal PC-&gt;Web Search-&gt;Ecommerce-&gt;Social Media-&gt;Smartphone-&gt;Cyber Security-&gt;Cloud Computing-&gt;Streaming-&gt;cryptocurrency-&gt;Automation-&gt;Data Analytics-&gt;AI\n\nData Analytics-&gt;AI is the last frontier and will create the most value and wealth because their application is limitless.",

        "selftext": "TL, DR: $PLTR is **a huge long play** and the company has its toes dipped in essentially every single industry.\n\nHere are some fundamentals: market cap 44.6bn, 2020 revenue 1.1bn (482m from commercial, 618m from the government), and consistent earnings beat. \n\nIn 2020, their revenue increased by 47% and they signed 21 contracts during Q4 2020 (21 in 13 weeks = **avg 2 contracts a week last quarter**) and they are working with 8 companies of Fortune 100, 12 of Global 100, and 24 of Global 300 (LARGE potential growth in the future).\n\nFrom 2019 to 2020 they increased their revenue from the commercial sector by **107%.** This is very important as the commercial sector is where they will profit from the most. \n\nPalantir currently has two products Gotham and Foundry, with Gotham being used mostly by the US government and Foundry is for the commercial sector. Essentially these two software work by integrating with the customer's existing system and simulating different operational models and outcomes for different decisions that the customer makes. To me, this technology is revolutionary as proven by how unpredictable the state of the world economy is right now. \n\nA few of the big names that are working with them now is **IBM**, **PG&amp;E**, **BP**, and many hedge funds and banks, and a big one recently is a 31m contract with **NHS England** where they are working to handle vaccine allocation **(**this is significant as the UK is facing a historically tough recession**)**\n\nThey have been consistently working with the US government on multiple contracts using Gotham, from finding bin Laden to verifying Iran's nuclear presence in 2018. Palantir is **one of the four** institutions that were given DoD IL-5 and on their way to DoD IL-6, to give you a scale Google is DoD IL-2 and Oracle is DoD IL-4, meaning they are responsible for handling extremely sensitive information for the DOD, their most recent contract is *project Maven*. Essentially Palantir is the CIA's AI twin.\n\nLooking back at the fundamentals, especially with the P/S ratio of over 40 right now, it can be overpriced to get in. But in the near future, PLTR will be the best stock to hold for 5+ years as the sky is their limit.\n\nEdit: forgot to put my position 300 @24.9",

        "selftext": "Karp's interview is being overblown.  The headlines are clickbait.  He talks America needing software(pure software/AI) that is the best to AVOID conflict in order to stay ahead of America's adversaries. Basically he's claiming Palantir Technologies to be S class disruptive Tech that can lead future innovations for America.\n\nKarp would rather put his focus on having the company put its \"best foot forward\" for the sake of protecting America and its private and public interests.\n\nHe was asked in the middle of the interview \"How would he entice new commercial customers?\"\n\nHe then starts talking about the how Foundry and Gotham are unique technically speaking ( claims his tech is 5 years ahead of everyone else low key), and the way they do business is unique.  For example he explains that Palantir  in the commercial space, Foundry is a Finished product as opposed to other ERP systems that require you to do an entire IT installation that can take months.  Foundry can be installed as a whole stack in a few days!  That difference is how Karp and Palantir thinks Software companies will sell their products.  He mentions that typically ERP systems entice customers with Jargon that promises to deliver instead of providing a product that stands out from the rest.  He truly believes Palantir is in a class of its own.   He actually believes despite having Elite tech that he provides for the biggest companies in the word, he thinks that Palantir can provide a ton of value to smaller to medium companies by offering superior ERP Software transforming their business to save them millions of dollars.\n\nThey talk little bit about PLTRs partnerships including 3M, BP, IBM, and AWS.  They talk about how IBM and AWS were thought to be rival companies to Palantir but instead decided to join forces because those companies understand how difficult it is to build what Palantir built with Foundry and Gotham.\n\nHE LIKES THE RETAIL INVESTORS, he HATES the \"INVESTORS\" who buy and sell the stock who don't have any clue about the company or its Tech.\n\nHe can't on camera \"PUMP\" the stock, so he just talks about how he's more focused on building the Company for the long-term.\n\nTLDR\n\nSo about a fucking hour talking about how superior the tech( Foundry/Gotham) is compared to any other software company's tech and how Karps ideological view of supporting America and its western values by providing Superiority and Complexity in order to stay ahead of its adversaries.\n\nFoundry is 5 years ahead of any other ERP software in the market.  IBM and AWS bow down to PLTR.\n\nIntrigued yet?\n\nI plan to hold this 10 years plus.\n\n235 shares@ 24.68, 6x  PLTR 4/1 30c",

        "selftext": "I'm sorry for everyone that has been stressing themselves out about SPACs the last couple of weeks. It's not an easy burden to carry with everything else going on. I myself was up about 60% on IPOD, IPOF before watching them tank (I'm now -15% on IPOF, oops!)\n\nA lot of folks will leave the SPAC world and the stock market all together (and probably crypto, if you think this stock market bubble is bad \ud83e\udd2a)\n\nRemember, if you listen to the news, you'll lose. You're supposed to buy low, sell high, not the opposite!\n\nI can't say the same about the rest of the market, but I can say that I would encourage you to start looking at re-entering many of your favorites at bargain prices:\n\n\\- **GHVI** (Matterport) $14.88: Matterport has a lot of potential as a long term value buy. It might drop a bit over the week, but I'm not the only one starting to notice.\n\n\\- **IPOF/IPOD** PRE-DA $11.99 / $11.43: Say what you will about Chamath, but I'm still very long. There's a lot of stupid news about him right now, don't let that get to you. He's still going to have his blockbuster hits. It's only been a couple of weeks. People have bad memories.\n\n\\- **CCX** PRE-DA $10.01: Remember CCIV? Churchill has a few more tricks up their sleeves. They're in my top 5 of management teams. Please tell me you're salivating as much as I am\n\n\\- **CHRC** PRE-DA $10.09: IBM team. There's a lot going on in that big ass company, including the opportunity to spin off parts of the business. Trading at $10.08. C'mon, folks.\n\n\\- \\*\\*FAII (\\*\\*ATI Physical Therapy) POST-DA $10.07 : No its not an EV spac but they are fkin huge in Illinois (where I'm from). I'm long ATI.  \n\\- **NGAC** 10.31 (XoS) POST-DA: If you thought this was a steal at 12.4, its an even better steal at 10.31\n\n\\- **VGAC** (23 &amp; Me): 10.54 Don't tell me that an ex-Googler isn't going to figure their shit out. 23 &amp; Me is still an enormous business opportunity and will continue to be.\n\nThis isn't advice, I'm not an adviser, I'm just sharing my opinion. I wish this was implicit, I hate constantly writing it! I own several of these, not all of them. I plan on owning all of them in the next day or two.",

        "selftext": "I don't fuck around. You can check my post history. Last year in June my picks were Apple, GM, BA, Disney, and Pinterest. If you bought all 5 you made a lot of money. I don't know how much. Someone else can do that math cause math is work and I don't get paid for this. I posted about Moderna shortly after at around $65 a share. Again same deal. Lots of money, don't know how much, fuck math.\n\n\\*\\*1. $AMRS - Amyris\\*\\*\n\nAmyris is one of the most complex companies on the market. I won't even bother trying to explain everything myself. But here is a quick summary. The company uses  machine learning to guide their biotechnology, and they use biotechnology to manufacture molecules very easily and cheaply, where the alternative is extracting it from nature or convoluted \"legacy\" manufacturing processes. For example, there are only two ways to get the chemicals squalene and squalane. A) Kill a shark or B) go to Amyris. And that is just one ingredient, where Amyris is manufacturing dozens of ingredients, and each of those ingredients are being leveraged in dozens of products. The most notable is Biossance, one of the fastest growing beauty brands.\n\nThey have so many other segments it would take a novel, so just trust me or read the link. Anyway, over the past year they have cut their debt by 60%, grown revenues by over 50%, and finished the year with $170M in revenues. They project $400 M for next year, and are now self funding, something not true for any other non-pharmaceutical biotech on earth (ie: all biotechs other than the ones making drugs). This is an enormous growth opportunity as they will easily dominate several manufacturing markets for years to come. There are some good articles out there on the internet that dissect this company further.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*2. $KLR - Kaleyra\\*\\*\n\nThis one is easy. It\u2019s literally just a smaller Italian Twilio. I call them Pizza-Twilio.\n\nCommunication+analysis services is becoming a huge business in the B2B segment.\n\nBoth Twilio and Pizza-Twilio do the same thing. Twilios current price is x45 their current sales. Pizza-Twilio\u2019s current price is only approx x3 sales. Now valuations are assigned for a reason and KLR hasn\u2019t earned a x45 multiple until they start growing faster, but still. There\u2019s a whole lot of numbers between x3 and x45. Even x10 is a pretty conservative multiple that would give you huge profits at this price.\n\nCommunication as a Service is an incredibly crowded industry and it will be a grind forever. I have no illusions that Kaleyra will ever end up comfortably on top all by itself. However, the industry is still so undeveloped. It is very much a race to capture new markets. One company can't possibly capture every market, since it is a sales-based industry. That means Twilio has to actually send their sales dudes out to places or set up zooms, meaning only so many customers can be gained at once. Which is all to say that Kaleyra will be just fine even if they don't beat Twilio or other competitors. They are very well positioned to dominate a few markets, namely India and the spicy parts of Europe (Italy, France, etc...). So far, they are doing exactly that. Q4 2020 India revenues are up 36% from the prior year. Q4 2020 USA revenues are up 100% from the prior year. Overall, 24% revenue growth.\n\nAnd all of this was true before 2 weeks ago when they acquired mGage, a wireless company that will allow KLR to sell its mass-text and calling services at much better margins since it will now have direct access to several major wireless networks in the US and Europe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*3. $DIS - Disney\\*\\*\n\nI don't need to explain Disney's business to you. The bull case here is very simple. The market has always given an enormous premium to companies with recurring service revenues. That's why companies like Microsoft trade more richly than companies like IBM or Intel. I predicted this phenomena 2 years ago with Apple, that's why I heavily advocated buying Apple (again, check my history). Now the same thing is about to unfold here. Netflix has a Price/Sales ratio of 9.5 and a PE of 86. Disney has a price/sales of 5.6. Their PE is a little bonkers due to park closures but when the dust settles in a year or so, PE would be around 40-50 if the market cap is unchanged. If Disney+ becomes Netflix, then the upside is double.  If Disney+ becomes even half as successful as Netflix, then that means a third of Disney would be streaming. .33 \\* 9.5 + .66 \\* 5.5 = 6.5 price/sales, or 16% upside \\*on top\\* of their regular growth from parks, media, etc... That is crude and oversimplified math but the point remains. Their multiple \\*is\\* going to change.\n\nWhat's more is that Disney has one enormous advantage over Netflix and other competitors, in that it already owns the media it is displaying. For Disney, content creation is a sunk cost because they were doing that anyway. While Netflix has to spend billions every year on original content JUST for streaming, Disney is already creating that content regardless. Basically, Disney is profiting 3 times off the same content expenses: in parks, in theaters, and on streaming services. Netflix doesn't have that economic efficiency and never will. I don't know if theaters will still be as relevant in 2 years. But either theaters rebound or the streaming market triples, because all that entertainment viewing demand has to go \\*somewhere\\*, and those are the only two media options that are viable right now. Either way, a win for Disney.\n\nPlus they have a dividend. If you are risk averse then Disney is my top pick on the \"stable side\" of stocks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHonorable Mentions:\n\n\\- Renalytix They make a kidney diagnostic that works way earlier than anything else that currently exists. No one else makes this. They are working on finishing their clinical testing and already have been in talks with insurers on price agreements.\n\n\\- Pinterest. I called Pinterest last year and they are still a solid buy. However, they probably grew too much, and now have to deal with re-opening pressures. So expect some volatility in the short term.\n\n\\- Drive Shack. They do golf stuff like Top Golf. COVID destroyed this company but if they can survive they have enormous upside. They have made some good decisions and are executing well on a plan to make Golf fun while still covid-friendly.\n\n\\- Bloom Energy. Green energy is not the best place to be in the first half of 2021, but they are by far the cheapest, and they have some great energy-storing technology that leverages hydrogen. There are so many green energy competitors but this is by far my favorite.",

        "selftext": "I'm 18 years old, and today I put most of my life savings dollars on IPOF options. Call me stupid, but my reasoning and proof are below.\n\n**Reasoning/DD:**\n\nChamath was almost solely responsible for the revival of SPACs with IPOA. For the past few years, he's been lauded by most of retail. Recently, however, Chamath is receiving the most backlash I've ever seen. For this reason IPOF is trading much lower than before. Is questioning Chamath warranted? Let's examine:\n\n**Reason 1 for Chamath hate: Selling his SPCE shares:**\n\nI don't understand the hate for this at all. Social Capital still owns some crazy amount of SPCE shares. The man is allowed to do whatever tf he wants with his money (especially since he was prob just margin called). I had a lot of SPCE too, so this was obviously disappointing, but maybe we should be mad at the company that said they would do commercial space flights in Summer 2020, and now plans to start them in 2022 (which will most likely be delayed).\n\n**Reason 2 for Chamath hate: CLOV has been shitty and he wasn't forthright about it/He's just a pump and dump artist**\n\nNot going to defend what Chamath did with CLOV, but let's look at his investing track record to see if he's really just a \"snake oil salesman.\"\n\n**Good Investments**\n\n**BTC:** \\&gt; 200x since he was first talking about it on MSNBC\n\n**TSLA:** \\&gt; 10x since he first talked about it\n\n**AMZN:** Don\u2019t know when he first talked about this but probably 2-4x since then\n\n**Slack:** 2.5x\n\n**VIRGIN GALACTIC:** (3x was a 6x not too long ago)\n\n**OPENDOOR:** (2x was nearly a 4x not too long ago)\n\n**SOFI:** (1.8x was nearly a 3x not too long ago)\n\n**PIPES**: A lot of the PIPES he's lead like MP or DM are up double/triple/quadruple.\n\n**Bad Investments**\n\n**CLOV:** Down about 15%. I'm not gonna defend this. Every part of this was absolutely terrible on his part. However, CLOV did hit $15 and hovered around $11 for quite some time. If you hated the investment which most people did, you could\u2019ve still gotten out gaining 10-50%.\n\n**BOX:** Hasn\u2019t done anything since he talked about it.\n\nAt the end of the day, if we had followed Chamath since he started gaining traction we would be rich despite the whole shitty CLOV situation. What Chamath did with CLOV was inexcusable, yes. But it is also the outlier of all his investments. Warren Buffett isn't defined by KHC or IBM, and Chamath isn't defined by CLOV or BOX. I think there's a great chance IPOF (which is of HUGE importance for Chamath) is a great company like Plaid, not a shitty one like CLOV.\n\n**Reason 3 for Chamath hate: He doesn't actually care about me :(**\n\nOh Whoopty Fucking Do. The billionaire doesn't care about you. SHOCKER. You are in this to make money, but you are also in this on your OWN. Never forget that. You and only you will look out for yourself. And as I outlined in reason 2, if you had followed Chamath, you would've made a shitload of money. His SPACS are almost guaranteed to 2x. Hell IPOF hit $17.81 without a fucking target. If you wanna make money, then following his investments is a good idea. If you're so deeply hurt that the billionaire is trying to make money for himself (which he literally said was his biggest goal during a talk at Stanford) then go cry about it while the rest of us make money.\n\n**Reason 4: He's a jerk and he left his wife**\n\nA lot of successful people are assholes. It's just the way it is. I'm here to make money. I could care less how he treats his employees even though it's a bit disappointing if true. As for the wife bullshit, none of us know what happened behind closed doors. If he left her to bang some hot actress, that's obviously a POS move. But again, I'm here to make money. I could care less what the man does with his dick.\n\n**Why I'm Buying:**\n\nI suspect there's about a pretty decent chance Chamath already has a deal for IPOF or is close to inking one. Several reasons for this. One, IPOE landed SOFI, which was suspected to be IPOF. This means that Chamath might've found/been talking to another larger company. Two, the trenches and weird snake tweet. And three, it's already been more days since Chamath announced IPOF than it took him to he amount to land targets for IPOB/IPOC. If Chamath can get Plaid (which is used by SOFI), IPOF could easily hit $25-30/share. If this is the case my options will 2000-3000x in value, and I will have life-changing money (maybe not that much for you coastal folk, but a lot for a rural kid like me). If not, I think it's quite likely that SPACS bounce back in the next month and IPOF reaches a similar price to what it was before the dip. Again, let's not forget IPOF almost hit $18 not too long ago. What has changed since then? Not much. Chamath will ink this deal and I (and potentially you) will hit big.\n\n**TLDR: The reasons for doubting Chamath are unfounded, and thus so too is the recent dip in IPOF. IPOF is likely to be a great company, and if the announcement comes soon: IPOF** **April Options** \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

They also announced on February 17, that they are debt free.\n\nHere's where things get interesting\n\nLooking at their financials, they are losing money on the bottom line every year, which is pretty common for a tech company, however, their revenue has grown YoY since they first started posting financials in 2017 and they reported 288% growth in revenues last year. Revenues in 2020 were $44 million and they announced yesterday that they are on track to meet their projection of $60.5 million in revenue.\n\nThis means that at the current share price and share structure, their market cap is below their 2021 projections for revenue AND they also announced yesterday that they are anticipating increasing their revenue projections by the end of Q2 through consolidation of their subsidiaries into one entity and through M&amp;A.\n\nAdditionally, they are currently working on beginning field testing a IoT communication platform for the chemical industry and signed an LOI with a prominent Fortune 500 company within the global chemical industry. That company has yet to be announced and the field testing is set to begin in April 2021.

There service is anticipated to launch in June and is expected to generate up to $128 million in revenue over 5 years\n\nI highly recommend looking at their website as it has a lot of information on it and it's pretty easy to follow a long with. I have also posted a link below to the PR from yesterday.\n\nWebsite: [https://www.iqstel.com/](https://www.iqstel.com/)\n\n3/25 PR: [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/iqst--iqstel-announces-ma-campaign-with-potential-to-push-revenue-over-60-5-million-forecast-301256102.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/iqst--iqstel-announces-ma-campaign-with-potential-to-push-revenue-over-60-5-million-forecast-301256102.html)",

        "selftext": "If Warren Buffett is known for anything, it is for his legendary patience. He is willing to build up tens of billions in cash, even well over 100 billion, and not feel compelled to use it until the deal is right. According to Buffett, who has compared investing to being a baseball batter waiting for just the right pitch, the stock market is the ideal place for such patience.\n\n\u201cThe stock market is the most obliging, money-making place in the world because you don\u2019t have to do anything,\u201d Warren Buffett said at the 2012 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting. \u201cYou know, you sit there with thousands of businesses being priced at the same price for the buyer and the seller\u2026 and it changes every day, and you\u2019ve got lots of information about most of those businesses, and you don\u2019t have to do anything. Compare that to any other investment alternative you\u2019ve got. I mean, you can\u2019t do that with farms. If you own a farm and the guy has the farm next to you and you\u2019d kind of like to buy him out or something, he\u2019s not going to name a price every day at which he\u2019ll buy your farm or sell you his farm, but you can do that with Berkshire Hathaway or IBM. It\u2019s a marvelous game. The rules are stacked in your favor, if you don\u2019t turn those rules upside down and start behaving like the drunken psychotic instead of the guy that\u2019s there to take advantage of it.\u201d\n\n**See Buffett\u2019s full explanation on being a patient investor, and the complete Lessons From Warren Buffett Series**\n\n[https://mazorsedge.com/lessons-from-warren-buffett-the-stock-market-is-the-most-obliging-money-making-place-in-the-world/](https://mazorsedge.com/lessons-from-warren-buffett-the-stock-market-is-the-most-obliging-money-making-place-in-the-world/)",

        "selftext": "On Friday, CTAC announced a definitive agreement with KORE software, the world leader in IoT and 5G enterprise software. I think this is a fundamentally sound company with the right SPAC partnership to accelerate the company\u2019s role in the future of IoT and 5G software. I put together some initial thoughts and due diligence, let me know what y\u2019all think!\n\n**Business Overview**\n\n* \\#1 global leader in IoT / 5G software with a large diversified customer base, including many Fortune 500 companies\n* Kore\u2019s solution provides a one-stop-shop for enterprises to use and deploy IoT devices and software\n* Kore\u2019s solution is a middleware product that connects IoT devices across an organization and layers on additional security protocols to ensure protection against cybersecurity threats\n* Also sells third-party IoT hardware devices and bundles them into their proprietary software platform\n* Presence in 5 separate verticals including healthcare, industrial, fleet vehicles, asset management, and communications\n* These verticals represent 80% of the worldwide IoT market and are expected to grow at a 25%+ CAGR on average over the next 5 years\n\n**Economic Moat**\n\n* Products are mission-critical for customers\u2019 daily operations (some of the world's top vertical market software-focused funds like Constellation Software or Vista Private Equity) would salivate over an acquisition like this. \n* Extremely sticky customer base, high barriers to entry, and high switching costs\n* Growth will pick up as society continues to embrace smart devices and connectivity\n* Positioned for a global 5G transition by offering multi-carrier gateways and private networks\n* Kore has strong relationships and contracts with the world\u2019s largest telecoms for near-term 5G deployment into enterprise IoT systems\n   * i.e., AT&amp;T, Vodafone, T-mobile, Rogers, Telefonica, Vivo\n\n**Ownership**\n\n* SPAC shareholders to own \\~36% of pro-forma company \u2013 this is very high compared to other SPACs where SPAC shareholders usually own less than 10% of the entity\n* Current owner, Abry Private Equity, will not take any cash proceeds at close and instead rollover 100% of their current investment \u2013 shows a high degree of conviction in KORE\n* PIPE investment is anchored by BlackRock, who has been involved in many successful SPACs\n\n**Management Team**\n\n* Kore\u2019s executive management team have decades of experience at leading public tech and consulting companies including AT&amp;T, IBM, Deloitte, Booz Allen, and Oliver Wyman\n* CTAC\u2019s sponsor is arguably one of the most well-suited teams to drive Kore\u2019s growth trajectory and bring it to the next step in its corporate evolution\n* CTAC\u2019s management are the founding members of Cerberus Capital, one of the largest and most reputable alternative investment managers with over $50bn AUM\n* CTAC\u2019s board of directors include the ex-CEO and Chairman of Nextel/Sprint and the CTO of Nokia\n\n**Financials**\n\n* Already generating 238M of revenue and is cash flow positive\n* 92% recurring revenue provides strong earnings and cash flow visibility\n* High margins (57% gross margin and 28% EBITDA margin)\n* Historic growth is lackluster (1-3% revenue growth over last few years)\n* This might have been a function of Covid and new customers delaying software/server installations on site\n* Expected near-term growth will pick up significantly as IoT and 5G rollouts increase among the Fortune 500 and small-medium sized enterprises\n* Forecasted 17% revenue growth CAGR over the next 5 years driven by higher IoT and 5G adoption from major end-markets\n\n**Valuation**\n\n* Reasonable valuation considering public software companies are currently running at high multiples (i.e., 25x EV/EBITDA for U.S. vertical market software companies)\n* 1bn EV and 900mm market cap (at $10 share price)\n* 16.9x 2021E Adj. EBITDA\n* 15.2x 2022E Adj. EBITDA",

        "selftext": "Teradyne Inc, Ticker: **TER (+38% mentions)**\n\nMarket cap: $19.5Bn\n\nTeradyne Inc supplies automation test equipment for semiconductors, wireless products, data storage and complex electronic systems in the consumer electronic, automotive, industrial, communications and aerospace sector.\n\nEssentially, the chip powering the phone or laptop you are reading this from has most likely been tested by Teradyne.\n\nTeradynes biggest customers include Samsung, Qualcomm, Nvidia, Intel, Boeing, Texas Instruments, 3M, and IBM.\n\nDon\u2019t have time to read the whole thing? I\u2019ll summarise below\n\n3 main reasons why I like this stock:\n\n* Overall semiconductor market future\n* Finances and balance sheet\n* Cathie Wood investment\n\n2 possible downsides:\n\n* Low future earnings forecasts\n* Recent price volatility\n\nFuture\n\nAlmost everything requires a semiconductor now, and that will only grow further in the future, some of the biggest examples are:\n\n* The majority of mobile phones sold nowadays are smartphones, and while that growth has slowed down over the last few years, 1.5 billion a year are still sold.\n* The ecosystem surrounding mobile phones is growing rapidly, think tablets, smart watches, headphones, laptops, speakers.\n* Internet-of-things devices are booming, think Alexa, smart lighting, ovens, fridges,heating, mirrors etc.\n* Car technology (especially in electric cars) is mostly driven by semiconductor technology, shifting further and further away from analog technology\n* Gaming, from Playstations to VR headsets, again all require semiconductor technology\n* Automated manufacturing\n\nEven without COVID, supply cannot keep up. There have been huge shortages this year for semiconductors causing pinches everywhere *(have you tried purchasing a PS5 recently?)* meaning lots of pent-up demand, even without, a number of HUGE factories have been built or will be built that are expected to ramp up supply. examples of those:\n\n* [Samsung\u2019s $17bn factory](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/319926-samsung-files-documents-to-build-new-17-billion-fab-in-the-united-states)\n* [TSM\u2019s $12bn plant](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/15/taiwan-semiconductor-to-build-a-12-billion-chip-pl.aspx)\n* [Intel\u2019s $7bn plant, completed in 2020](https://hexus.net/tech/news/cpu/145990-intel-fab-42-now-ready-pump-leading-edge-products/)\n* [List of all current fabrication plants to give you an idea of size of market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_semiconductor_fabrication_plants)\n\nAll of this will require automation and testing.\n\nLong-term, it\u2019s very safe to assume that irrespective of economic or technological shifts, semiconductor demand will not only sustain, but surge. A few things on the horizon that will likely affect this:\n\n* 5G technology being rolled out worldwide\n* Space technology &amp; tourism growth\n* AI &amp; data technology\n\nThe biggest kicker? Teradyne provide the majority of the automation and testing for all of these sectors, meaning any growth here only benefits them.\n\nFurthermore, to me they are also proofed from the whole *\u201ceconomy opening up means a move away from tech\u201c* as it\u2019s not like people will stop using electronic devices, unlike companies like Zoom which will see a big drop in usership as normality returns.\n\nFinances\n\nEven during a COVID year, Teradyne grew revenues from $2.29bn to $3.12bn, an increase of 36%.\n\nThey grew their net income even further, going from $467m to $784m, an increase of 67%.\n\nEarnings per share *(profit by number of shares)* also grew, from $2.6 to $4.28 (**+64%**) last year which is astounding. (*general consensus is anything above 25% growth is good).*\n\nWhen taking the price of the stock into account, and looking at Price-to-Earnings ratio *(Price of the stock vs the earnings per share of a stock, the lower the better)* Teradyne has a PE ratio of 24.9x, which is way better than the industry average of 38x.\n\nFrom a debt position, Teradyne is very healthy with an equity-to-debt ratio *(the lower the better, below 1 means more equity than debt)* of 0.18.\n\nCathie Wood Investment\n\nCathie Wood, the very aggressive bullish investor whos ETF [ARK Invest](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ARKK/performance/) saw returns of 152% last year, [has recently purchased a further 139,619 shares](https://247wallst.com/investing/2021/03/12/cathie-woods-ark-invest-buys-and-sells-3-12/) to add to the current position.\n\nExtra purchasing here shows long-term confidence, as this was added after ARK had to rebalance and sell some Teradyne shares last year.\n\nPossible Downsides\n\nSome analysts are predicting modest future revenue growth at 5.8%, compared to the industry average of 16.2%.\n\nFurthermore, the price this year has seen some large volatility, suffering from the sell-off that affected technology and growth stocks earlier this year. If more sell-offs ensue, this could cause the price to drop further in the short term.\n\nSummary\n\nTeradyne commands a large portion of a market that is only growing further every year. A financially healthy and well managed company, with high revenue and EPS growth, along with some strong investment backing. While there may be some volatility in the price of the stock short-term, long-term this company still has tremendous potential.",

        "selftext": "**TLDR**\n\n* EVIO Labs specializes in marijuana testing\n* Good early growth, new labs, acquisitions\n* 2020 impact from Covid-19 and lawsuit led to cost reduction and paying debt off\n* Sold some assets including share dilution, CEO resigned\n* Pivoting start to the year in 2021, organizational turnaround\n* Jan/Feb - New CEO appointed, including other new members of SLT\n* March - Lab Upgrade, new contract with $CBDL, fillings in audit, waiting for catalysts\n\n**Post and Research Updates**\n\nFYI \u2013 this post has been updated based on further research, errors, CEO update and suggestions from the community. Some of those include edits to changes in Price Target, Senior Leadership Team, Sociability Factors, Upcoming Catalyst, concerns regarding EVIO Labs in 2020.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nDear Redditors! Here I present you with an in-depth DD on $EVIO. I have spent a lot of hours researching and reading through the history, current state, and the potential future for this ticker. This is a speculative play that is high reward and high risk, however I personally sit more on the bullish side based on some of the things I have uncovered during my research that are presented here below and recent milestones like securing a contract with $CBDL a week ago, new SLT (all women led), lab upgrade in Steep Hill.\n\nShould that be the case, we could expect this ticker reach its previous share price highs in the future that were ranging from **$0.017 \u2013 0.020 cents in August 2020 and beyond depending on business growth. This PT has been tested on two occasions already, on 15 Jan 2021 and 9 Feb 2021. Based on current share price this could equate to 5 x multiplier.**\n\nPlease note this is only my opinion and please if I missed anything out do let me know in the comments and I will re-update just like this version.\n\n* Market Cap \u2013 4,632,831\n* Share Price \u2013 0.0029\n* Float - 89,142,473 \u2013 September 3rd, 2020 (waiting for an update \u2013 share price represents dilution already taken into effect however Float is not represented yet)\n\n**Upcoming Catalyst**\n\n* Updating SEC fillings **(already in Audit and confirmed by Lori on 28/03/2021)**\n* Removing Stop Sign\n* Becoming Current\n* More Contracts\n* Social Media Engagement\n* New Labs partnerships, licencing, and acquisition\n* Legalization!!!\n\n**EVIO Labs**\n\nWas founded back in 2014, with an aim to become the leading provider of cannabis, hemp, and CBD testing, providing highest quality analytical, R&amp;D and consulting services.\n\nEvio Labs offers all types of cannabis and CBD testing for flower, trim, manufactured products, biomass, crude oils, isolates, distillates, edible, and difficult to test items like patches and aerosols. Their capabilities include up to 13 cannabinoids, 42 terpenes, 66 pesticides, heavy metals, residual solvents, microbial tests, plant leaf ratios, plant inspections, and more.\n\n**Operating EVIO Lab locations**\n\n* Alberta Canada (Keystone Labs)\n* Berkeley, California (Steep Hill)\n\n**History**\n\nEvio Labs had a lot of success in the early days, being most respected and reputable organization within the CBD testing. They excelled and stood out from their competition by building a world class team to ensure they provide high levels of testing accuracy, exceptional customer service and professionalism.\n\nYear on year end they have demonstrated financial growth with a focus on expanding and acquiring new labs. Most recent reports indicate EVIO Lab **revenue increased 12.3%** increase during the first quarter ending December 31, 2019 and an **18% increase** during second quarter ending March 31, 2020.\n\n**However (concerns)!**\n\nCovid-19 had massive impact on the organization **resulting in 45% reduction** in revenue during the third quarter ending June 30, 2020. They were also being sued by the State of Oregon for allowing employees to take marijuana home instead of destroying the residue (why waste stuff \u2639). This forced them to sell of assets and dilute shares to settle the debts. This included the sale of their labs in Massachusetts and Oregon. This is where, we can see the dip in share value, alerting investors to re-strategize for the right reasons.\n\nFurthermore, the CEO, co-founder William Waldrop has decided to resign and stepdown in December 2020 (3 months ago). Due to change in leadership and organizational re-structuring they have failed to report to SEC and received a STOP sign, in my view probably because they were themselves in the midst of major re-structuring.\n\n**Bullish Future State and Market Needs**\n\nDespite, the concerns mentioned in the above, to me, this ticker presents an exciting opportunity to be a part of a turnaround story for this organization. In my view, this where investors can make huge returns by identifying and speculating future organizational states before they come to fruition and, this could be one of those tickers.\n\nFor one, the most obvious fact, that weed is getting legalized suggesting favourable market growth. Weed stocks are hot, and they will remain hot for the next couple of years. I am sure, most of you guys noticed how some of those have already blown up and are not planning to stop. More weed = more testing.\n\n**But enough of that**, Lori Glauser, is the new CEO of EVIO labs since recent William\u2019s departure. She is also the co-founder of EVIO, and her track record from previous organizational experience suggest she has more than enough capability to run and take this business forward. She worked at IBM, and most recently at EY (the BIG 4) and consulted various utility executives of multinational organizations. Since being appointed, she started picking up the pieces and is preparing the organization for growth in 2021 and beyond. She has built a completely new SLT (women led), that are currently settling in their roles. Here below are milestones she achieved so far suggesting so.\n\n**Evidenced Milestones**\n\n* New website, 2020 - [https://hemptesting.com/](https://hemptesting.com/)\n* Management transition, January / February 2021\n* Lab Facility Upgrades, March 2021 (you can see the pictures on her FB profile and IG)\n* Getting verified on OTC, March 2021 (OTC official website)\n* New contract with $CBDL, March 2021\n* These step-by-step milestone achievements suggest to me they are looking to turnaround in 2021 which was also raised by EVIO SLT previously suggesting they anticipate full recovery in this fiscal year.\n\n**Sociability Factor**\n\nThese guys have quite a large following across social media platforms, however, have been quite inactive, which of course is expected as of my previously raised concerns. Although, this is expected to change over the next couple of months when Lori finally gets the core business objectives achieved like SEC filings and removing the STOP sign.\n\nThis is already becoming evident based on their recent Facebook (FB) and Instagram (IG) post updating followers on their lab developments, changes to SLT and responding to investor questions. You can also view their upgraded lab facilities via FB and IG.\n\nPlease also note there is a website called ***\u201cOTCBBSTOCKNEWS\u201d*** that is spreading false news, so please ignore news updates from them.\n\n* IG - [https://www.instagram.com/evio\\_labs/](https://www.instagram.com/evio_labs/)\n* Facebook - [https://www.facebook.com/eviolabs/](https://www.facebook.com/eviolabs/)\n* Twitter - google it, can\u2019t paste it here \n* LinkedIn - [https://www.linkedin.com/company/eviolabs/](https://www.linkedin.com/company/eviolabs/)\n\n**Senior Leadership Team (SLT)**\n\nAs mentioned in the above EVIO Labs had a complete sweep through their previous SLT to such extent that it is now all woman led. Management transition has only just taken place around Jan/Feb timeframe. I think this is a good step in direction towards diversity and inclusion and likewise demonstrates an attempt for a turnaround. Photos of SLT can be viewed on FB post as I found that not everyone has LinkedIn profiles.\n\n**Lori Glauser, MBA - CEO**\n\nMs. Glauser co-founded EVIO (previously Signal Bay) in 2014 as an advisory services firm, which has evolved to become a multi-state operator of analytical testing laboratories. Lori is also the founding chair of Women Grow \u2013 Las Vegas, served on FOCUS standards committee, co-author of Medical Marijuana Desk Reference, and continues to provide advisory services to entrepreneurs.\n\nLori has 25 years prior experience in engineering, management consulting, and start-ups. Her expertise lies in business planning and operations, business process design, financial forecasting, risk, customer experience, and regulatory and policy. Ms. Glauser previously worked with **Ernst &amp; Young, IBM, and Financial Times Group**. She also launched two startups. Lori has a BS in Mechanical Engineering from the University of New Hampshire and an MBA from University of Alabama.\n\nLinkedIn - [https://www.linkedin.com/in/loriglauser/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/loriglauser/)\n\n**Kawai Medeiros - Lab Director**\n\n**Claudia Crouse - Operations and HR**\n\n**Kathryn Darby \u2013 VP Client Services**\n\n**Svetlana Ageyava - Lab Director**\n\n**Sara Garcia - Operations Manager**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nEVIO labs was a successful start-up, growing, expanding, and become the number one in CBD and Hemp testing and consulting services, resulting in increasing revenue year on year. However, Covid-19 has impacted the business greatly, including a lawsuit, forcing the organization to re-structure, sell assets and dilute some shares. Although, the new CEO has started to pick up the pieces to ensure 2021 acts as a pivotal year to resume and maintain the brand image.\n\n**References**\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cbd-life-sciences-inc-cbdl-110000869.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cbd-life-sciences-inc-cbdl-110000869.html)\n\n[https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/EVIO/security](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/EVIO/security)\n\n[https://sec.report/CIK/0000715788](https://sec.report/CIK/0000715788)\n\n[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200915005498/en/EVIO-Inc.-Provides-Shareholder-Update](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200915005498/en/EVIO-Inc.-Provides-Shareholder-Update)\n\n[https://ksusentinel.com/2021/03/23/cannabis-testing-services-market-projected-to-witness-a-double-digit-cagr-during-2020-to-2026-coherent-market-insights/](https://ksusentinel.com/2021/03/23/cannabis-testing-services-market-projected-to-witness-a-double-digit-cagr-during-2020-to-2026-coherent-market-insights/)",

        "selftext": "DISCLAIMER: Please do your own research - no investment is without risk, and may lose value.\n\nMarket Cap = 146M. Share price at close = $7.91\n\nSECTOR: Information Technology, INDUSTRY: Technology Hardware, Storage &amp; Peripherals\n\nSummary: One Stop Systems, Inc. designs, manufactures, and markets custom **high-speed computing systems** for high-performance edge computing applications in the US and internationally. Its GPU expansion units add hundreds of computing cores and teraflops of computing performance to virtually any original equipment manufacturer server. OSS' flash storage arrays provide hundreds of terabytes of storage and **millions of input/output operations per second** (see applications, below). It also offers servers for PCI express-over-cable expansion; desktop expansion appliances in various configurations that add input/output flexibility to any user's desktop system; **PCIe expansions,** and ruggedized mobile high-performance compute devices to meet specialized requirements for devices deployed at the edge in **various environmental conditions**. One Stop Systems, Inc. was founded in 1998 and is headquartered in Escondido, California. \n\nAPPLICATIONS \\- buckle in, exciting stuff.\n\nWith wide-ranging applications like AI, autonomous cars, and military technologies we don't even know exist yet (laser tech, threat detection, missile targeting), \"edge computing\" is sure to expand and meet growing demand for high-performance computing able to provide millions of actionable data points every second. In January 2021, OSS announced their 4th military contract via project \u201cOrange Gear,\u201d an AI system that enables U.S. Navy aircraft to conduct real-time AI-powered threat detection. Shooting down enemy assets, what guides the weapon? OSS enables the second-to-second calculations to achieve such precision. \n\nInteresting fact: OSS chief sales and marketing officer Jim Ison says they are going to \u201cexpand the support of wartime theater applications for [land, sea, air and space](http://www.globenewswire.com/fr/news-release/2021/01/05/2153506/0/en/OSS-Wins-Fourth-Program-with-Major-Military-Contractor.html).\u201d ***SPACE***. What an incredible hint of things to come! The final frontier, space exploration represents a vast yet untapped potential area of edge computing expansion. Heck, the previous administration just created a new *branch of the military* specifically for protecting America\u2019s interests above the stratosphere. Also consider that the USA, with a defense budget of $700 billion annually, will likely purchase American-made edge computing tech in-house, avoiding adversaries like China. OSS seems here to stay.\n\nWhile military contracts might not whet your appetite, consider autonomous driving. OSS\u2019 ingenious \u201cAI on the Fly\u201d enables in-vehicle \u201cruggedized\u201d autonomous driving. Here is a company rep, much smarter than myself, excited to provide more detail on [OSS' computing devices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAagBi_j4cA&amp;ab_channel=InsideHPCReport) in self-driving vehicles.\n\nSo what is a PCIe? The PCIe is the motherboard site that interfaces with a computer's graphics cards, hard drive adapter, SSDs, Wi-Fi, and Ethernet hardware connections. In June 2020, OSS introduced the [world\u2019s first](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/06/22/2051412/0/en/OSS-Introduces-World-s-First-PCIe-Gen-4-Expansion-System-for-NVIDIA-A100-PCIe-GPUs.html#:~:text=(Nasdaq%3A%20OSS)%2C%20a,20X%20over%20the%20previous%20generation) PCIe Gen4 Expansion System that fully supports NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs, which can boost computing performance up to 20X over the previous generation. The OSS Gen4 Expansion System allows system developers to scale out almost any Gen4 server by adding up to eight NVIDIA A100 GPUs. The system is ideal for boosting the performance of compute-intensive applications like **AI training, AI inference, video analytics and XR rendering**. What is XR rendering? X is just a placeholder! Virtual, Mixed, or Augmented reality (VR, MR, or AR, respectively) experiences include those where users generate new forms of reality by bringing digital objects into the physical world and those that see the bringing physical world objects into the digital world. Yes, OSS also powers augmented reality applications.\n\nINDUSTRY - is there growth to \u201cEdge Computing\u201d as a field? \n\n[MarketsandMarkets](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/edge-computing-market-133384090.html#:~:text=Edge%20computing%20can%20be%20used,%2C%20healthcare%2C%20and%20many%20others) projects the global edge computing market to grow from **$3.6 billion in 2020 to $15.7 billion by 2025**, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 34.1% during the forecast period. Factors such as the growing adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) across industries; rising demand for low-latency processing and real-time, automated decision-making solutions; and a need for surmounting exponentially increasing data volumes and network traffic.\n\nPARTNERSHIPS\n\nOSS is diversified in its partnerships with the big boys - Apple, Nvidia, Intel, AMD, Boeing, IBM, Lenovo, HP, and [many others](https://www.onestopsystems.com/partners).\n\nMEAT AND POTATOES - finances \n\nFollowing IPO in 2018, OSS already generates $60 million in revenue, increasing 45% YOY. \n\nHow about its market share? To find a company\u2019s size, or \u201cmarket cap,\u201d multiply the current share price by the number of shares. OSS clocks in with 16,620,000 shares x $7.91 = 131M. For a company with a 130M market cap, $60M in revenue represents very strong revenue (46%) to its size. For comparison\u2019s sake, NVDA market cap is 335B and generates 16.7B annually (5%). With 31% institutional ownership \u2013 and [increasing](https://fintel.io/so/us/oss) \u2013 this is certainly on the radar of the big players.\n\nA note about earnings per share (EPS) - OSS\u2019 earnings announcement is coming between March 19 and 25. Based on two analyst forecasts, the consensus EPS forecast for the quarter is $0.04 with 12.17M revenue. Indeed, OSS has quickly transformed itself into a profitable enterprise with [consistent revenue beats](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OSS/earnings) to boot. \n\nBALANCE SHEET\n\nIn short, OSS has 40M in assets, 11M in liabilities and 2M total debt. \n\n*Processing img 0357jvc0uok61...*\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nFormerly the interim head, now-CEO [David Raun](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/06/25/2053412/0/en/OSS-Appoints-David-Raun-Technology-Industry-Veteran-as-President-CEO.html) has two decades of experience in the PCIe area, and led PLX Technology to record revenue and profits before getting acquired by Broadcom (AVGO).\n\nCOMPETITORS\n\nForget the stellar partnerships, what about the competition? Within the well-differentiated industry of Hardware, Storage, and Peripherals are 40 companies ranging from Apple to Ricoh. The direct competitor to watch for is Supermicro (SMCI). SMCI, however, makes no mention of cloud-readiness in its press release (coincidentally publicized merely hours after OSS, on the very same day - nervous, perhaps?). \n\nOn the other hand, the OSS 4UV can connect almost any Gen 4 server to eight A100 PCIe GPUs and two NICs, also offering a complete NVIDIA GPU **cloud-ready solution** with the OSS 4UV pre-installed in an OSS 2U-EOS-4a Gen 4 server.\n\nOFFERING\n\nPremarket Tuesday, March 2nd, OSS announced a 1.5M share offering to an institutional investor. Remarkably, OSS showed strength into the mid-morning, after opening at $7.56 it hit a high of $8.79 before succumbing to general market weakness and closing at $7.91, down 11% (see daily chart below). A green candle the day after an offering? Sounds like a great dip to buy. \n\nTECHNICALS\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tf412r4quok61.jpg?width=1522&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d061155dc969bb6663af3fd38c9d1014ed799264\n\nVolume has been readily coming in. A stock that previously traded around 40k volume is now averaging big volumes, over 1M+ daily. What happened? I think institutions are beginning to catch on. Currently above the 5, 20, and 50 moving averages, OSS bounced nicely off the 20 MA during a big intra-day rally (40%+) on March 1st, 2021 hitting a fresh 52-week high of $9.50 without apparent news. \n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nInvestors should ask the question, \"where could this company be in 2 to 3 years?\" With OSS, we have a case study in a profitable company meeting big revenue expectations relatively soon after IPO, invaluable partnerships, military contracts, and anticipatory growth in the industry and beyond.\n\nPOSITIONS: I am in for 1300 shares at $8.60.",

They will have less Expenses on their Balance Sheets both CAPEX (Capital Expenditure think maintenance and renovation) as well as OPEX (Operating Expenses think salaries, inventory of food and beverage.)\n\nWe will be significantly more PROFITABLE already in the second half of 2021. AMC is already growing. The Movies and the experience will only continue to get better with time. Waiters/waitresses. Lazy boys. Massive Screens. I'm watching the numbers everywhere. Imagine what the future has in store. Yeah it could use a little cleanliness and some creativity, but Aron has already touched on these subjects and they are in all stages of renovation and upgrading. The technology is only getting better. they do drone course, Weekly Gaming tournaments on all the different gaming consoles. The ideas are endless.\n\nAMC has already cleared a shitload of debt, and we thank Silver Lake and Wanda. It helped take bankruptcy off the table just a very short time ago. Look at the progress they've made since then. But mainly for me its about the system.\n\nnetflix is dead. everyone wants to get out of their house. vaccines are coming out. ex hedge fund portfolio managers need a place to take their kids to the movies. I say they go to AMC.\n\n**The MovIement is here.**\n\nThis is my humble opinion - I will never sell you pipe dreams - **it very well could go higher than $198.45** \\- but the **POINT** is we can **BREAK** \\- the system - and put the SEC and HEDGEFUNDS feet to the fire.\n\n\"It was never about money for **us** it was about **us against the system**.

Some of those include edits to changes in Price Target, Senior Leadership Team, Sociability Factors, Upcoming Catalyst, concerns regarding EVIO Labs in 2020.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nDear Redditors! Here I present you with an in-depth DD on $EVIO. I have spent a lot of hours researching and reading through the history, current state, and the potential future for this ticker. This is a speculative play that is high reward and high risk, however I personally sit more on the bullish side based on some of the things I have uncovered during my research that are presented here below and recent milestones like securing a contract with $CBDL a week ago, new SLT (all women led), lab upgrade in Steep Hill.\n\nShould that be the case, we could expect this ticker reach its previous share price highs in the future that were ranging from **$0.017 \u2013 0.020 cents in August 2020 and beyond depending on business growth. This PT has been tested on two occasions already, on 15 Jan 2021 and 9 Feb 2021. Based on current share price this could equate to 5 x multiplier.**\n\nPlease note this is only my opinion and please if I missed anything out do let me know in the comments and I will re-update just like this version.\n\n* Market Cap \u2013 4,632,831\n* Share Price \u2013 0.0029\n* Float - 89,142,473 \u2013 September 3rd, 2020 (waiting for an update \u2013 share price represents dilution already taken into effect however Float is not represented yet)\n\n**Upcoming Catalyst**\n\n* Updating SEC fillings **(already in Audit and confirmed by Lori on 28/03/2021)**\n* Removing Stop Sign\n* Becoming Current\n* More Contracts\n* Social Media Engagement\n* New Labs partnerships, licencing, and acquisition\n* Legalization!!!\n\n**EVIO Labs**\n\nWas founded back in 2014, with an aim to become the leading provider of cannabis, hemp, and CBD testing, providing highest quality analytical, R&amp;D and consulting services.\n\nEvio Labs offers all types of cannabis and CBD testing for flower, trim, manufactured products, biomass, crude oils, isolates, distillates, edible, and difficult to test items like patches and aerosols. Their capabilities include up to 13 cannabinoids, 42 terpenes, 66 pesticides, heavy metals, residual solvents, microbial tests, plant leaf ratios, plant inspections, and more.\n\n**Operating EVIO Lab locations**\n\n* Alberta Canada (Keystone Labs)\n* Berkeley, California (Steep Hill)\n\n**History**\n\nEvio Labs had a lot of success in the early days, being most respected and reputable organization within the CBD testing. They excelled and stood out from their competition by building a world class team to ensure they provide high levels of testing accuracy, exceptional customer service and professionalism.\n\nYear on year end they have demonstrated financial growth with a focus on expanding and acquiring new labs. Most recent reports indicate EVIO Lab **revenue increased 12.3%** increase during the first quarter ending December 31, 2019 and an **18% increase** during second quarter ending March 31, 2020.\n\n**However (concerns)!**\n\nCovid-19 had massive impact on the organization **resulting in 45% reduction** in revenue during the third quarter ending June 30, 2020. They were also being sued by the State of Oregon for allowing employees to take marijuana home instead of destroying the residue (why waste stuff \u2639). This forced them to sell of assets and dilute shares to settle the debts. This included the sale of their labs in Massachusetts and Oregon. This is where, we can see the dip in share value, alerting investors to re-strategize for the right reasons.\n\nFurthermore, the CEO, co-founder William Waldrop has decided to resign and stepdown in December 2020 (3 months ago). Due to change in leadership and organizational re-structuring they have failed to report to SEC and received a STOP sign, in my view probably because they were themselves in the midst of major re-structuring.\n\n**Bullish Future State and Market Needs**\n\nDespite, the concerns mentioned in the above, to me, this ticker presents an exciting opportunity to be a part of a turnaround story for this organization. In my view, this where investors can make huge returns by identifying and speculating future organizational states before they come to fruition and, this could be one of those tickers.\n\nFor one, the most obvious fact, that weed is getting legalized suggesting favourable market growth. Weed stocks are hot, and they will remain hot for the next couple of years. I am sure, most of you guys noticed how some of those have already blown up and are not planning to stop. More weed = more testing.\n\n**But enough of that**, Lori Glauser, is the new CEO of EVIO labs since recent William\u2019s departure. She is also the co-founder of EVIO, and her track record from previous organizational experience suggest she has more than enough capability to run and take this business forward. She worked at IBM, and most recently at EY (the BIG 4) and consulted various utility executives of multinational organizations. Since being appointed, she started picking up the pieces and is preparing the organization for growth in 2021 and beyond. She has built a completely new SLT (women led), that are currently settling in their roles. Here below are milestones she achieved so far suggesting so.\n\n**Evidenced Milestones**\n\n* New website, 2020 - [https://hemptesting.com/](https://hemptesting.com/)\n* Management transition, January / February 2021\n* Lab Facility Upgrades, March 2021 (you can see the pictures on her FB profile and IG)\n* Getting verified on OTC, March 2021 (OTC official website)\n* New contract with $CBDL, March 2021\n* These step-by-step milestone achievements suggest to me they are looking to turnaround in 2021 which was also raised by EVIO SLT previously suggesting they anticipate full recovery in this fiscal year.\n\n**Sociability Factor**\n\nThese guys have quite a large following across social media platforms, however, have been quite inactive, which of course is expected as of my previously raised concerns. Although, this is expected to change over the next couple of months when Lori finally gets the core business objectives achieved like SEC filings and removing the STOP sign.\n\nThis is already becoming evident based on their recent Facebook (FB) and Instagram (IG) post updating followers on their lab developments, changes to SLT and responding to investor questions. You can also view their upgraded lab facilities via FB and IG.\n\nPlease also note there is a website called ***\u201cOTCBBSTOCKNEWS\u201d*** that is spreading false news, so please ignore news updates from them.\n\n* IG - [https://www.instagram.com/evio\\_labs/](https://www.instagram.com/evio_labs/)\n* Facebook - [https://www.facebook.com/eviolabs/](https://www.facebook.com/eviolabs/)\n* Twitter - [https://twitter.com/eviolabs](https://twitter.com/eviolabs)\n* LinkedIn - [https://www.linkedin.com/company/eviolabs/](https://www.linkedin.com/company/eviolabs/)\n\n**Senior Leadership Team (SLT)**\n\nAs mentioned in the above EVIO Labs had a complete sweep through their previous SLT to such extent that it is now all woman led. Management transition has only just taken place around Jan/Feb timeframe. I think this is a good step in direction towards diversity and inclusion and likewise demonstrates an attempt for a turnaround. Photos of SLT can be viewed on FB post as I found that not everyone has LinkedIn profiles.\n\n**Lori Glauser, MBA - CEO**\n\nMs. Glauser co-founded EVIO (previously Signal Bay) in 2014 as an advisory services firm, which has evolved to become a multi-state operator of analytical testing laboratories. Lori is also the founding chair of Women Grow \u2013 Las Vegas, served on FOCUS standards committee, co-author of Medical Marijuana Desk Reference, and continues to provide advisory services to entrepreneurs.\n\nLori has 25 years prior experience in engineering, management consulting, and start-ups. Her expertise lies in business planning and operations, business process design, financial forecasting, risk, customer experience, and regulatory and policy. Ms. Glauser previously worked with **Ernst &amp; Young, IBM, and Financial Times Group**. She also launched two startups. Lori has a BS in Mechanical Engineering from the University of New Hampshire and an MBA from University of Alabama.\n\nLinkedIn - [https://www.linkedin.com/in/loriglauser/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/loriglauser/)\n\n**Kawai Medeiros - Lab Director**\n\n**Claudia Crouse - Operations and HR**\n\n**Kathryn Darby \u2013 VP Client Services**\n\n**Svetlana Ageyava - Lab Director**\n\n**Sara Garcia - Operations Manager**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nEVIO labs was a successful start-up, growing, expanding, and become the number one in CBD and Hemp testing and consulting services, resulting in increasing revenue year on year. However, Covid-19 has impacted the business greatly, including a lawsuit, forcing the organization to re-structure, sell assets and dilute some shares. Although, the new CEO has started to pick up the pieces to ensure 2021 acts as a pivotal year to resume and maintain the brand image.\n\n**References**\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cbd-life-sciences-inc-cbdl-110000869.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cbd-life-sciences-inc-cbdl-110000869.html)\n\n[https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/EVIO/security](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/EVIO/security)\n\n[https://sec.report/CIK/0000715788](https://sec.report/CIK/0000715788)\n\n[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200915005498/en/EVIO-Inc.-Provides-Shareholder-Update](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200915005498/en/EVIO-Inc.-Provides-Shareholder-Update)\n\n[https://ksusentinel.com/2021/03/23/cannabis-testing-services-market-projected-to-witness-a-double-digit-cagr-during-2020-to-2026-coherent-market-insights/](https://ksusentinel.com/2021/03/23/cannabis-testing-services-market-projected-to-witness-a-double-digit-cagr-during-2020-to-2026-coherent-market-insights/)",

Here I present you with an in-depth DD on $EVIO. I have spent a lot of hours researching and reading through the history, current state, and the potential future for this ticker. This is a speculative play that is high reward and high risk, however I personally sit more on the bullish side based on some of the things I have uncovered during my research that are presented here below and recent milestones like securing a contract with $CBDL a week ago, new SLT (all women led), lab upgrade in Steep Hill.\n\nShould that be the case, we could expect this ticker reach its previous share price highs in the future that were ranging from **$0.017 \u2013 0.020 cents in August 2020 and beyond depending on business growth. This PT has been tested on two occasions already, on 15 Jan 2021 and 9 Feb 2021. Based on current share price this could equate to 5 x multiplier.**\n\nPlease note this is only my opinion and please if I missed anything out do let me know in the comments and I will re-update just like this version.\n\n* Market Cap \u2013 4,632,831\n* Share Price \u2013 0.0029\n* Float - 89,142,473 \u2013 September 3rd, 2020 (waiting for an update \u2013 share price represents dilution already taken into effect however Float is not represented yet)\n\n**Upcoming Catalyst**\n\n* Updating SEC fillings **(already in Audit and confirmed by Lori on 28/03/2021)**\n* Removing Stop Sign\n* Becoming Current\n* More Contracts\n* Social Media Engagement\n* New Labs partnerships, licencing, and acquisition\n* Legalization!!!\n\n**EVIO Labs**\n\nWas founded back in 2014, with an aim to become the leading provider of cannabis, hemp, and CBD testing, providing highest quality analytical, R&amp;D and consulting services.\n\nEvio Labs offers all types of cannabis and CBD testing for flower, trim, manufactured products, biomass, crude oils, isolates, distillates, edible, and difficult to test items like patches and aerosols. Their capabilities include up to 13 cannabinoids, 42 terpenes, 66 pesticides, heavy metals, residual solvents, microbial tests, plant leaf ratios, plant inspections, and more.\n\n**Operating EVIO Lab locations**\n\n* Alberta Canada (Keystone Labs)\n* Berkeley, California (Steep Hill)\n\n**History**\n\nEvio Labs had a lot of success in the early days, being most respected and reputable organization within the CBD testing. They excelled and stood out from their competition by building a world class team to ensure they provide high levels of testing accuracy, exceptional customer service and professionalism.\n\nYear on year end they have demonstrated financial growth with a focus on expanding and acquiring new labs. Most recent reports indicate EVIO Lab **revenue increased 12.3%** increase during the first quarter ending December 31, 2019 and an **18% increase** during second quarter ending March 31, 2020.\n\n**However (concerns)!**\n\nCovid-19 had massive impact on the organization **resulting in 45% reduction** in revenue during the third quarter ending June 30, 2020. They were also being sued by the State of Oregon for allowing employees to take marijuana home instead of destroying the residue (why waste stuff \u2639). This forced them to sell of assets and dilute shares to settle the debts. This included the sale of their labs in Massachusetts and Oregon. This is where, we can see the dip in share value, alerting investors to re-strategize for the right reasons.\n\nFurthermore, the CEO, co-founder William Waldrop has decided to resign and stepdown in December 2020 (3 months ago). Due to change in leadership and organizational re-structuring they have failed to report to SEC and received a STOP sign, in my view probably because they were themselves in the midst of major re-structuring.\n\n**Bullish Future State and Market Needs**\n\nDespite, the concerns mentioned in the above, to me, this ticker presents an exciting opportunity to be a part of a turnaround story for this organization. In my view, this where investors can make huge returns by identifying and speculating future organizational states before they come to fruition and, this could be one of those tickers.\n\nFor one, the most obvious fact, that weed is getting legalized suggesting favourable market growth. Weed stocks are hot, and they will remain hot for the next couple of years. I am sure, most of you guys noticed how some of those have already blown up and are not planning to stop. More weed = more testing.\n\n**But enough of that**, Lori Glauser, is the new CEO of EVIO labs since recent William\u2019s departure. She is also the co-founder of EVIO, and her track record from previous organizational experience suggest she has more than enough capability to run and take this business forward. She worked at IBM, and most recently at EY (the BIG 4) and consulted various utility executives of multinational organizations. Since being appointed, she started picking up the pieces and is preparing the organization for growth in 2021 and beyond. She has built a completely new SLT (women led), that are currently settling in their roles. Here below are milestones she achieved so far suggesting so.\n\n**Evidenced Milestones**\n\n* New website, 2020 - [https://hemptesting.com/](https://hemptesting.com/)\n* Management transition, January / February 2021\n* Lab Facility Upgrades, March 2021 (you can see the pictures on her FB profile and IG)\n* Getting verified on OTC, March 2021 (OTC official website)\n* New contract with $CBDL, March 2021\n* These step-by-step milestone achievements suggest to me they are looking to turnaround in 2021 which was also raised by EVIO SLT previously suggesting they anticipate full recovery in this fiscal year.\n\n**Sociability Factor**\n\nThese guys have quite a large following across social media platforms, however, have been quite inactive, which of course is expected as of my previously raised concerns. Although, this is expected to change over the next couple of months when Lori finally gets the core business objectives achieved like SEC filings and removing the STOP sign.\n\nThis is already becoming evident based on their recent Facebook (FB) and Instagram (IG) post updating followers on their lab developments, changes to SLT and responding to investor questions. You can also view their upgraded lab facilities via FB and IG.\n\nPlease also note there is a website called ***\u201cOTCBBSTOCKNEWS\u201d*** that is spreading false news, so please ignore news updates from them.\n\n* IG - [https://www.instagram.com/evio\\_labs/](https://www.instagram.com/evio_labs/)\n* Facebook - [https://www.facebook.com/eviolabs/](https://www.facebook.com/eviolabs/)\n* Twitter - [https://twitter.com/eviolabs](https://twitter.com/eviolabs)\n* LinkedIn - [https://www.linkedin.com/company/eviolabs/](https://www.linkedin.com/company/eviolabs/)\n\n**Senior Leadership Team (SLT)**\n\nAs mentioned in the above EVIO Labs had a complete sweep through their previous SLT to such extent that it is now all woman led. Management transition has only just taken place around Jan/Feb timeframe. I think this is a good step in direction towards diversity and inclusion and likewise demonstrates an attempt for a turnaround. Photos of SLT can be viewed on FB post as I found that not everyone has LinkedIn profiles.\n\n**Lori Glauser, MBA - CEO**\n\nMs. Glauser co-founded EVIO (previously Signal Bay) in 2014 as an advisory services firm, which has evolved to become a multi-state operator of analytical testing laboratories. Lori is also the founding chair of Women Grow \u2013 Las Vegas, served on FOCUS standards committee, co-author of Medical Marijuana Desk Reference, and continues to provide advisory services to entrepreneurs.\n\nLori has 25 years prior experience in engineering, management consulting, and start-ups. Her expertise lies in business planning and operations, business process design, financial forecasting, risk, customer experience, and regulatory and policy. Ms. Glauser previously worked with **Ernst &amp; Young, IBM, and Financial Times Group**. She also launched two startups. Lori has a BS in Mechanical Engineering from the University of New Hampshire and an MBA from University of Alabama.\n\nLinkedIn - [https://www.linkedin.com/in/loriglauser/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/loriglauser/)\n\n**Kawai Medeiros - Lab Director**\n\n**Claudia Crouse - Operations and HR**\n\n**Kathryn Darby \u2013 VP Client Services**\n\n**Svetlana Ageyava - Lab Director**\n\n**Sara Garcia - Operations Manager**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nEVIO labs was a successful start-up, growing, expanding, and become the number one in CBD and Hemp testing and consulting services, resulting in increasing revenue year on year. However, Covid-19 has impacted the business greatly, including a lawsuit, forcing the organization to re-structure, sell assets and dilute some shares. Although, the new CEO has started to pick up the pieces to ensure 2021 acts as a pivotal year to resume and maintain the brand image.\n\n**References**\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cbd-life-sciences-inc-cbdl-110000869.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cbd-life-sciences-inc-cbdl-110000869.html)\n\n[https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/EVIO/security](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/EVIO/security)\n\n[https://sec.report/CIK/0000715788](https://sec.report/CIK/0000715788)\n\n[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200915005498/en/EVIO-Inc.-Provides-Shareholder-Update](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200915005498/en/EVIO-Inc.-Provides-Shareholder-Update)\n\n[https://ksusentinel.com/2021/03/23/cannabis-testing-services-market-projected-to-witness-a-double-digit-cagr-during-2020-to-2026-coherent-market-insights/](https://ksusentinel.com/2021/03/23/cannabis-testing-services-market-projected-to-witness-a-double-digit-cagr-during-2020-to-2026-coherent-market-insights/)",

        "selftext": "Just an odd observation...\n\nFor the last couple of months I\u2019ve noticed a trend. I have 2 stock watchlists that I look at everyday. We\u2019ll call group A) full of companies like Apple, Facebook, NIVIDIA, Wayfair, AirBNB, Disney, Apple, and a bunch of other companies that fall into that group. And then I have group b) with GameStop, AMC,  SLGG, UW MC, BABA, Volkswagen, IBM, and a few others. And I find probably 95% of the time if not more often than that, the days that I see group A is in the green, group B is in the red and then the days group A is in the red, group B is in the green.  Obviously, this is probably just some dumb observation, but I just find it odd how often this happens. I happened to,listen to Dave Portnoy one morning about a week ago just for the hell of it, and he actually brought up the same kind of scenario about some of the same stocks I mentioned. If anyone else has noticed this and has some type of logical reason for why they think this happens, I\u2019d love to hear what you have to say. And not that any of it really matters, just an observation. Cuz no matter what, I just continue to Buy/HODL our beloved GME! \u270b\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\ud83c\udffc\ud83e\udd8d",

The SPAC is seeking to acquire a firm in the health technology sector.\n\nCoupled with this news,\nIBM explores sale of Watson Health.\n\nSource:\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/ibm-explores-sale-of-ibm-watson-health-11613696770\n\nInternational Business Machines Corp. is exploring a potential sale of its IBM Watson Health business, according to people familiar with the matter, as the technology giant\u2019s new chief executive moves to streamline the company and become more competitive in cloud computing.\n\nIBM is studying alternatives for the unit that could include a sale to a private-equity firm or industry player or a merger with a blank-check company, the people said. The unit, which employs artificial intelligence to help hospitals, insurers and drugmakers manage their data, has roughly $1 billion in annual revenue and isn\u2019t currently profitable, the people said.\n\nIts brands include Merge Healthcare, which analyzes mammograms and MRIs; Phytel, which assists with patient communications; and Truven Health Analytics, which analyzes complex healthcare data.\n\n\nWith that being said, this might be a great target.

        "selftext": "I've run into stocks listed across multiple exchanges before, but was fuzzy on the requirements/process.\n\nCompanies can list on a foreign exchange without a domestic entity, however [investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duallisting.asp) asserts that:\n\n&gt;Considering exchange rates and other complications, stock price should remain the same on both exchanges. If not, an arbiter will bring them together.\n\nWhich confused me, until I came across the wikipedia [cross-listing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_listing#Difference_with_Depository_Receipts) article which states:\n\n&gt;...the stock is *technically* fungible between exchanges.

        "selftext": "I  watched the Jim Cramer interview again where he admits to some of the games he played when he owned a hedge fund and It got me thinking. He describes times he would take 5 to 12 million to manipulate a stock when he was short or long and needed a boost in his direction. He gives an example of IBM.\n\nThere is talk of Hedge Funds playing our side, the long game, knowing there is a lot of money on this side. That explains the volume we see at times. $GME got stopped the first time cause it was going supersonic to the moon. If this time it takes a slow pace to the moon like it's doing the last few days would the SEC/Government step in and shut it down? If HFs are playing this side, and Cramer used to drive up or down prices to start a trend, it seems like that tatic could be used here over a slow pace to ensure the price keeps climbing but at a slower pace not to trip any of the alarms. It would seem so questionable if it climbs slow, and the government steps in and says \"no more\" if done at such a slow pace.\n\nI'm curious, cause i see some people (outside this forum) saying it will never hit 1K or 10K, but if there is HFs playing our side and the pace stays slow, seems inevitable to me.",

        "selftext": "**TLDR**\n\n* EVIO Labs specializes in marijuana testing\n* Good early growth, new labs, acquisitions\n* 2020 impact from Covid-19 and lawsuit led to cost reduction and paying debt off\n* Sold some assets including share dilution, CEO resigned\n* Pivoting start to the year in 2021, organizational turnaround\n* Jan/Feb - New CEO appointed, including other new members of SLT\n* March - Lab Upgrade, new contract with $CBDL, fillings in audit, waiting for catalysts\n\n**Post and Research Updates**\n\nFYI \u2013 this post has been updated based on further research, errors, CEO update and suggestions from the community. Some of those include edits to changes in Price Target, Senior Leadership Team, Sociability Factors, Upcoming Catalyst, concerns regarding EVIO Labs in 2020.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nDear Redditors! Here I present you with an in-depth DD on $EVIO. I have spent a lot of hours researching and reading through the history, current state, and the potential future for this ticker. This is a speculative play that is high reward and high risk, however I personally sit more on the bullish side based on some of the things I have uncovered during my research that are presented here below and recent milestones like securing a contract with $CBDL a week ago, new SLT (all women led), lab upgrade in Steep Hill.\n\nShould that be the case, we could expect this ticker reach its previous share price highs in the future that were ranging from **$0.017 \u2013 0.020 cents in August 2020 and beyond depending on business growth. This PT has been tested on two occasions already, on 15 Jan 2021 and 9 Feb 2021. Based on current share price this could equate to 5 x multiplier.**\n\nPlease note this is only my opinion and please if I missed anything out do let me know in the comments and I will re-update just like this version.\n\n* Market Cap \u2013 4,632,831\n* Share Price \u2013 0.0029\n* Float - 89,142,473 \u2013 September 3rd, 2020 (waiting for an update \u2013 share price represents dilution already taken into effect however Float is not represented yet)\n\n**Upcoming Catalyst**\n\n* Updating SEC fillings **(already in Audit and confirmed by Lori on 28/03/2021)**\n* Removing Stop Sign\n* Becoming Current\n* More Contracts\n* Social Media Engagement\n* New Labs partnerships, licencing, and acquisition\n* Legalization!!!\n\n**EVIO Labs**\n\nWas founded back in 2014, with an aim to become the leading provider of cannabis, hemp, and CBD testing, providing highest quality analytical, R&amp;D and consulting services.\n\nEvio Labs offers all types of cannabis and CBD testing for flower, trim, manufactured products, biomass, crude oils, isolates, distillates, edible, and difficult to test items like patches and aerosols. Their capabilities include up to 13 cannabinoids, 42 terpenes, 66 pesticides, heavy metals, residual solvents, microbial tests, plant leaf ratios, plant inspections, and more.\n\n**Operating EVIO Lab locations**\n\n* Alberta Canada (Keystone Labs)\n* Berkeley, California (Steep Hill)\n\n**History**\n\nEvio Labs had a lot of success in the early days, being most respected and reputable organization within the CBD testing. They excelled and stood out from their competition by building a world class team to ensure they provide high levels of testing accuracy, exceptional customer service and professionalism.\n\nYear on year end they have demonstrated financial growth with a focus on expanding and acquiring new labs. Most recent reports indicate EVIO Lab **revenue increased 12.3%** increase during the first quarter ending December 31, 2019 and an **18% increase** during second quarter ending March 31, 2020.\n\n**However (concerns)!**\n\nCovid-19 had massive impact on the organization **resulting in 45% reduction** in revenue during the third quarter ending June 30, 2020. They were also being sued by the State of Oregon for allowing employees to take marijuana home instead of destroying the residue (why waste stuff \u2639). This forced them to sell of assets and dilute shares to settle the debts. This included the sale of their labs in Massachusetts and Oregon. This is where, we can see the dip in share value, alerting investors to re-strategize for the right reasons.\n\nFurthermore, the CEO, co-founder William Waldrop has decided to resign and stepdown in December 2020 (3 months ago). Due to change in leadership and organizational re-structuring they have failed to report to SEC and received a STOP sign, in my view probably because they were themselves in the midst of major re-structuring.\n\n**Bullish Future State and Market Needs**\n\nDespite, the concerns mentioned in the above, to me, this ticker presents an exciting opportunity to be a part of a turnaround story for this organization. In my view, this where investors can make huge returns by identifying and speculating future organizational states before they come to fruition and, this could be one of those tickers.\n\nFor one, the most obvious fact, that weed is getting legalized suggesting favourable market growth. Weed stocks are hot, and they will remain hot for the next couple of years. I am sure, most of you guys noticed how some of those have already blown up and are not planning to stop. More weed = more testing.\n\n**But enough of that**, Lori Glauser, is the new CEO of EVIO labs since recent William\u2019s departure. She is also the co-founder of EVIO, and her track record from previous organizational experience suggest she has more than enough capability to run and take this business forward. She worked at IBM, and most recently at EY (the BIG 4) and consulted various utility executives of multinational organizations. Since being appointed, she started picking up the pieces and is preparing the organization for growth in 2021 and beyond. She has built a completely new SLT (women led), that are currently settling in their roles. Here below are milestones she achieved so far suggesting so.\n\n**Evidenced Milestones**\n\n* New website, 2020 - [https://hemptesting.com/](https://hemptesting.com/)\n* Management transition, January / February 2021\n* Lab Facility Upgrades, March 2021 (you can see the pictures on her FB profile and IG)\n* Getting verified on OTC, March 2021 (OTC official website)\n* New contract with $CBDL, March 2021\n* These step-by-step milestone achievements suggest to me they are looking to turnaround in 2021 which was also raised by EVIO SLT previously suggesting they anticipate full recovery in this fiscal year.\n\n**Sociability Factor**\n\nThese guys have quite a large following across social media platforms, however, have been quite inactive, which of course is expected as of my previously raised concerns. Although, this is expected to change over the next couple of months when Lori finally gets the core business objectives achieved like SEC filings and removing the STOP sign.\n\nThis is already becoming evident based on their recent Facebook (FB) and Instagram (IG) post updating followers on their lab developments, changes to SLT and responding to investor questions. You can also view their upgraded lab facilities via FB and IG.\n\nPlease also note there is a website called ***\u201cOTCBBSTOCKNEWS\u201d*** that is spreading false news, so please ignore news updates from them.\n\n* IG - [https://www.instagram.com/evio\\_labs/](https://www.instagram.com/evio_labs/)\n* Facebook - [https://www.facebook.com/eviolabs/](https://www.facebook.com/eviolabs/)\n* Twitter - [https://twitter.com/eviolabs](https://twitter.com/eviolabs)\n* LinkedIn - [https://www.linkedin.com/company/eviolabs/](https://www.linkedin.com/company/eviolabs/)\n\n**Senior Leadership Team (SLT)**\n\nAs mentioned in the above EVIO Labs had a complete sweep through their previous SLT to such extent that it is now all woman led. Management transition has only just taken place around Jan/Feb timeframe. I think this is a good step in direction towards diversity and inclusion and likewise demonstrates an attempt for a turnaround. Photos of SLT can be viewed on FB post as I found that not everyone has LinkedIn profiles.\n\n**Lori Glauser, MBA - CEO**\n\nMs. Glauser co-founded EVIO (previously Signal Bay) in 2014 as an advisory services firm, which has evolved to become a multi-state operator of analytical testing laboratories. Lori is also the founding chair of Women Grow \u2013 Las Vegas, served on FOCUS standards committee, co-author of Medical Marijuana Desk Reference, and continues to provide advisory services to entrepreneurs.\n\nLori has 25 years prior experience in engineering, management consulting, and start-ups. Her expertise lies in business planning and operations, business process design, financial forecasting, risk, customer experience, and regulatory and policy. Ms. Glauser previously worked with **Ernst &amp; Young, IBM, and Financial Times Group**. She also launched two startups. Lori has a BS in Mechanical Engineering from the University of New Hampshire and an MBA from University of Alabama.\n\nLinkedIn - [https://www.linkedin.com/in/loriglauser/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/loriglauser/)\n\n**Kawai Medeiros - Lab Director**\n\n**Claudia Crouse - Operations and HR**\n\n**Kathryn Darby \u2013 VP Client Services**\n\n**Svetlana Ageyava - Lab Director**\n\n**Sara Garcia - Operations Manager**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nEVIO labs was a successful start-up, growing, expanding, and become the number one in CBD and Hemp testing and consulting services, resulting in increasing revenue year on year. However, Covid-19 has impacted the business greatly, including a lawsuit, forcing the organization to re-structure, sell assets and dilute some shares. Although, the new CEO has started to pick up the pieces to ensure 2021 acts as a pivotal year to resume and maintain the brand image.\n\n**References**\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cbd-life-sciences-inc-cbdl-110000869.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cbd-life-sciences-inc-cbdl-110000869.html)\n\n[https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/EVIO/security](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/EVIO/security)\n\n[https://sec.report/CIK/0000715788](https://sec.report/CIK/0000715788)\n\n[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200915005498/en/EVIO-Inc.-Provides-Shareholder-Update](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200915005498/en/EVIO-Inc.-Provides-Shareholder-Update)\n\n[https://ksusentinel.com/2021/03/23/cannabis-testing-services-market-projected-to-witness-a-double-digit-cagr-during-2020-to-2026-coherent-market-insights/](https://ksusentinel.com/2021/03/23/cannabis-testing-services-market-projected-to-witness-a-double-digit-cagr-during-2020-to-2026-coherent-market-insights/)",

Some of those include edits to changes in Price Target, Senior Leadership Team, Sociability Factors, Upcoming Catalyst, concerns regarding EVIO Labs in 2020.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nDear Redditors! Here I present you with an in-depth DD on $EVIO. I have spent a lot of hours researching and reading through the history, current state, and the potential future for this ticker. This is a speculative play that is high reward and high risk, however I personally sit more on the bullish side based on some of the things I have uncovered during my research that are presented here below and recent milestones like securing a contract with $CBDL a week ago, new SLT (all women led), lab upgrade in Steep Hill.\n\nShould that be the case, we could expect this ticker reach its previous share price highs in the future that were ranging from **$0.017 \u2013 0.020 cents in August 2020 and beyond depending on business growth. This PT has been tested on two occasions already, on 15 Jan 2021 and 9 Feb 2021. Based on current share price this could equate to 5 x multiplier.**\n\nPlease note this is only my opinion and please if I missed anything out do let me know in the comments and I will re-update just like this version.\n\n* Market Cap \u2013 4,632,831\n* Share Price \u2013 0.0029\n* Float - 89,142,473 \u2013 September 3rd, 2020 (waiting for an update \u2013 share price represents dilution already taken into effect however Float is not represented yet)\n\n**Upcoming Catalyst**\n\n* Updating SEC fillings **(already in Audit and confirmed by Lori on 28/03/2021)**\n* Removing Stop Sign\n* Becoming Current\n* More Contracts\n* Social Media Engagement\n* New Labs partnerships, licencing, and acquisition\n* Legalization!!!\n\n**EVIO Labs**\n\nWas founded back in 2014, with an aim to become the leading provider of cannabis, hemp, and CBD testing, providing highest quality analytical, R&amp;D and consulting services.\n\nEvio Labs offers all types of cannabis and CBD testing for flower, trim, manufactured products, biomass, crude oils, isolates, distillates, edible, and difficult to test items like patches and aerosols. Their capabilities include up to 13 cannabinoids, 42 terpenes, 66 pesticides, heavy metals, residual solvents, microbial tests, plant leaf ratios, plant inspections, and more.\n\n**Operating EVIO Lab locations**\n\n* Alberta Canada (Keystone Labs)\n* Berkeley, California (Steep Hill)\n\n**History**\n\nEvio Labs had a lot of success in the early days, being most respected and reputable organization within the CBD testing. They excelled and stood out from their competition by building a world class team to ensure they provide high levels of testing accuracy, exceptional customer service and professionalism.\n\nYear on year end they have demonstrated financial growth with a focus on expanding and acquiring new labs. Most recent reports indicate EVIO Lab **revenue increased 12.3%** increase during the first quarter ending December 31, 2019 and an **18% increase** during second quarter ending March 31, 2020.\n\n**However (concerns)!**\n\nCovid-19 had massive impact on the organization **resulting in 45% reduction** in revenue during the third quarter ending June 30, 2020. They were also being sued by the State of Oregon for allowing employees to take marijuana home instead of destroying the residue (why waste stuff \u2639). This forced them to sell of assets and dilute shares to settle the debts. This included the sale of their labs in Massachusetts and Oregon. This is where, we can see the dip in share value, alerting investors to re-strategize for the right reasons.\n\nFurthermore, the CEO, co-founder William Waldrop has decided to resign and stepdown in December 2020 (3 months ago). Due to change in leadership and organizational re-structuring they have failed to report to SEC and received a STOP sign, in my view probably because they were themselves in the midst of major re-structuring.\n\n**Bullish Future State and Market Needs**\n\nDespite, the concerns mentioned in the above, to me, this ticker presents an exciting opportunity to be a part of a turnaround story for this organization. In my view, this where investors can make huge returns by identifying and speculating future organizational states before they come to fruition and, this could be one of those tickers.\n\nFor one, the most obvious fact, that weed is getting legalized suggesting favourable market growth. Weed stocks are hot, and they will remain hot for the next couple of years. I am sure, most of you guys noticed how some of those have already blown up and are not planning to stop. More weed = more testing.\n\n**But enough of that**, Lori Glauser, is the new CEO of EVIO labs since recent William\u2019s departure. She is also the co-founder of EVIO, and her track record from previous organizational experience suggest she has more than enough capability to run and take this business forward. She worked at IBM, and most recently at EY (the BIG 4) and consulted various utility executives of multinational organizations. Since being appointed, she started picking up the pieces and is preparing the organization for growth in 2021 and beyond. She has built a completely new SLT (women led), that are currently settling in their roles. Here below are milestones she achieved so far suggesting so.\n\n**Evidenced Milestones**\n\n* New website, 2020 - [https://hemptesting.com/](https://hemptesting.com/)\n* Management transition, January / February 2021\n* Lab Facility Upgrades, March 2021 (you can see the pictures on her FB profile and IG)\n* Getting verified on OTC, March 2021 (OTC official website)\n* New contract with $CBDL, March 2021\n* These step-by-step milestone achievements suggest to me they are looking to turnaround in 2021 which was also raised by EVIO SLT previously suggesting they anticipate full recovery in this fiscal year.\n\n**Sociability Factor**\n\nThese guys have quite a large following across social media platforms, however, have been quite inactive, which of course is expected as of my previously raised concerns. Although, this is expected to change over the next couple of months when Lori finally gets the core business objectives achieved like SEC filings and removing the STOP sign.\n\nThis is already becoming evident based on their recent Facebook (FB) and Instagram (IG) post updating followers on their lab developments, changes to SLT and responding to investor questions. You can also view their upgraded lab facilities via FB and IG.\n\nPlease also note there is a website called ***\u201cOTCBBSTOCKNEWS\u201d*** that is spreading false news, so please ignore news updates from them.\n\n* IG - [https://www.instagram.com/evio\\_labs/](https://www.instagram.com/evio_labs/)\n* Facebook - [https://www.facebook.com/eviolabs/](https://www.facebook.com/eviolabs/)\n* Twitter - [https://twitter.com/eviolabs](https://twitter.com/eviolabs)\n* LinkedIn - [https://www.linkedin.com/company/eviolabs/](https://www.linkedin.com/company/eviolabs/)\n\n**Senior Leadership Team (SLT)**\n\nAs mentioned in the above EVIO Labs had a complete sweep through their previous SLT to such extent that it is now all woman led. Management transition has only just taken place around Jan/Feb timeframe. I think this is a good step in direction towards diversity and inclusion and likewise demonstrates an attempt for a turnaround. Photos of SLT can be viewed on FB post as I found that not everyone has LinkedIn profiles.\n\n**Lori Glauser, MBA - CEO**\n\nMs. Glauser co-founded EVIO (previously Signal Bay) in 2014 as an advisory services firm, which has evolved to become a multi-state operator of analytical testing laboratories. Lori is also the founding chair of Women Grow \u2013 Las Vegas, served on FOCUS standards committee, co-author of Medical Marijuana Desk Reference, and continues to provide advisory services to entrepreneurs.\n\nLori has 25 years prior experience in engineering, management consulting, and start-ups. Her expertise lies in business planning and operations, business process design, financial forecasting, risk, customer experience, and regulatory and policy. Ms. Glauser previously worked with **Ernst &amp; Young, IBM, and Financial Times Group**. She also launched two startups. Lori has a BS in Mechanical Engineering from the University of New Hampshire and an MBA from University of Alabama.\n\nLinkedIn - [https://www.linkedin.com/in/loriglauser/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/loriglauser/)\n\n**Kawai Medeiros - Lab Director**\n\n**Claudia Crouse - Operations and HR**\n\n**Kathryn Darby \u2013 VP Client Services**\n\n**Svetlana Ageyava - Lab Director**\n\n**Sara Garcia - Operations Manager**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nEVIO labs was a successful start-up, growing, expanding, and become the number one in CBD and Hemp testing and consulting services, resulting in increasing revenue year on year. However, Covid-19 has impacted the business greatly, including a lawsuit, forcing the organization to re-structure, sell assets and dilute some shares. Although, the new CEO has started to pick up the pieces to ensure 2021 acts as a pivotal year to resume and maintain the brand image.\n\n**References**\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cbd-life-sciences-inc-cbdl-110000869.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cbd-life-sciences-inc-cbdl-110000869.html)\n\n[https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/EVIO/security](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/EVIO/security)\n\n[https://sec.report/CIK/0000715788](https://sec.report/CIK/0000715788)\n\n[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200915005498/en/EVIO-Inc.-Provides-Shareholder-Update](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200915005498/en/EVIO-Inc.-Provides-Shareholder-Update)\n\n[https://ksusentinel.com/2021/03/23/cannabis-testing-services-market-projected-to-witness-a-double-digit-cagr-during-2020-to-2026-coherent-market-insights/](https://ksusentinel.com/2021/03/23/cannabis-testing-services-market-projected-to-witness-a-double-digit-cagr-during-2020-to-2026-coherent-market-insights/)",

        "selftext": "Teradyne Inc, Ticker: **TER (+38% mentions)**\n\nMarket cap: $19.5Bn\n\nTeradyne Inc supplies automation test equipment for semiconductors, wireless products, data storage and complex electronic systems in the consumer electronic, automotive, industrial, communications and aerospace sector.\n\nEssentially, the chip powering the phone or laptop you are reading this from has most likely been tested by Teradyne.\n\nTeradynes biggest customers include Samsung, Qualcomm, Nvidia, Intel, Boeing, Texas Instruments, 3M, and IBM.\n\nDon\u2019t have time to read the whole thing? I\u2019ll summarise below\n\n3 main reasons why I like this stock:\n\n* Overall semiconductor market future\n* Finances and balance sheet\n* Cathie Wood investment\n\n2 possible downsides:\n\n* Low future earnings forecasts\n* Recent price volatility\n\n### Future\n\nAlmost everything requires a semiconductor now, and that will only grow further in the future, some of the biggest examples are:\n\n* The majority of mobile phones sold nowadays are smartphones, and while that growth has slowed down over the last few years, 1.5 billion a year are still sold.\n* The ecosystem surrounding mobile phones is growing rapidly, think tablets, smart watches, headphones, laptops, speakers.\n* Internet-of-things devices are booming, think Alexa, smart lighting, ovens, fridges,heating, mirrors etc.\n* Car technology (especially in electric cars) is mostly driven by semiconductor technology, shifting further and further away from analog technology\n* Gaming, from Playstations to VR headsets, again all require semiconductor technology\n* Automated manufacturing\n\nEven without COVID, supply cannot keep up. There have been huge shortages this year for semiconductors causing pinches everywhere *(have you tried purchasing a PS5 recently?)* meaning lots of pent-up demand, even without, a number of HUGE factories have been built or will be built that are expected to ramp up supply. examples of those:\n\n* [Samsung\u2019s $17bn factory](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/319926-samsung-files-documents-to-build-new-17-billion-fab-in-the-united-states)\n* [TSM\u2019s $12bn plant](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/15/taiwan-semiconductor-to-build-a-12-billion-chip-pl.aspx)\n* [Intel\u2019s $7bn plant, completed in 2020](https://hexus.net/tech/news/cpu/145990-intel-fab-42-now-ready-pump-leading-edge-products/)\n* [List of all current fabrication plants to give you an idea of size of market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_semiconductor_fabrication_plants)\n\nAll of this will require automation and testing.\n\nLong-term, it\u2019s very safe to assume that irrespective of economic or technological shifts, semiconductor demand will not only sustain, but surge. A few things on the horizon that will likely affect this:\n\n* 5G technology being rolled out worldwide\n* Space technology &amp; tourism growth\n* AI &amp; data technology\n\nThe biggest kicker? Teradyne provide the majority of the automation and testing for all of these sectors, meaning any growth here only benefits them.\n\nFurthermore, to me they are also proofed from the whole *\u201ceconomy opening up means a move away from tech\u201c* as it\u2019s not like people will stop using electronic devices, unlike companies like Zoom which will see a big drop in usership as normality returns.\n\n### Finances\n\nEven during a COVID year, Teradyne grew revenues from $2.29bn to $3.12bn, an increase of 36%.\n\nThey grew their net income even further, going from $467m to $784m, an increase of 67%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img et37l5sf9ln61...*\n\nEarnings per share *(profit by number of shares)* also grew, from $2.6 to $4.28 (**+64%**) last year which is astounding. (*general consensus is anything above 25% growth is good).*\n\nWhen taking the price of the stock into account, and looking at Price-to-Earnings ratio *(Price of the stock vs the earnings per share of a stock, the lower the better)* Teradyne has a PE ratio of 24.9x, which is way better than the industry average of 38x.\n\nFrom a debt position, Teradyne is very healthy with an equity-to-debt ratio *(the lower the better, below 1 means more equity than debt)* of 0.18.\n\n### Cathie Wood Investment\n\nCathie Wood, the very aggressive bullish investor whos ETF [ARK Invest](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ARKK/performance/) saw returns of 152% last year, [has recently purchased a further 139,619 shares](https://247wallst.com/investing/2021/03/12/cathie-woods-ark-invest-buys-and-sells-3-12/) to add to the current position.\n\nExtra purchasing here shows long-term confidence, as this was added after ARK had to rebalance and sell some Teradyne shares last year.\n\n### Possible Downsides\n\nSome analysts are predicting modest future revenue growth at 5.8%, compared to the industry average of 16.2%.\n\nFurthermore, the price this year has seen some large volatility, suffering from the sell-off that affected technology and growth stocks earlier this year. If more sell-offs ensue, this could cause the price to drop further in the short term.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Choppy price action for TER this year, dropping from all time highs of $148.](https://preview.redd.it/lxmx8hhh9ln61.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec2e87089db55b57a7494d10096876124ffd1b66)\n\n### Summary\n\nTeradyne commands a large portion of a market that is only growing further every year. A financially healthy and well managed company, with high revenue and EPS growth, along with some strong investment backing. While there may be some volatility in the price of the stock short-term, long-term this company still has tremendous potential.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNone of this is financial advice, only my personal opinion. please do your own research before dealing into any stocks.",

I just can't seem to figure out why this isn't being talked about as much.\n\nDD:  \n-Walmart &amp; Ecoark had a contract which allowed Walmart to use the ZEST technology and work with Ecoark in order to help Walmart's supply chain in the produce world. It allowed Walmart to save billions on wasted food that went bad too quickly. A couple of years ago, Walmart terminated the contract and made their own program (with the help of IBM) called Eden, which did the exact same thing.  \n-Walmart got caught with their hand in the cookie jar and Ecoark is suing them. \n- Every instance of Walmart in court is to either wait their opponents out until they cannot pay for the long court cases, or buy out the company/ its product so they can continue to make money on it.\n-You can check the court documents on Pacer with Judge Moody presiding over the case.  \n- Yahoo there are a bunch of bashers, but there is one person whom has done a workup of those owning shares and how much they would be worth, he goes by \"Zest vs Walmart Jury trial 3/29\" and has been very thorough throughout the entire process and ignores a lot of the bashers which are paid to downplay certain stocks.\n-It was recently a penny stock but the company did a reverse split to bring it onto the nasdaq. \n-court case started today and a jury was chosen upon, ecoark wants to see this through to the end, and with messages coming from the head of the company at the time, there isn\u2019t much that Walmart can do to say they didn\u2019t steal a product under contract. \n\nPlease do your DD, I put the details to get someone interested in helping their financial future, but there is so much info on this that can be found by a simple search.",

In my view, this where investors can make huge returns by identifying and speculating future organizational states before they come to fruition and, this could be one of those tickers.\n\nFor one, the most obvious fact, that weed is getting legalized suggesting favourable market growth. Weed stocks are hot, and they will remain hot for the next couple of years. I am sure, most of you guys noticed how some of those have already blown up and are not planning to stop. More weed = more testing.\n\n**But enough of that**, Lori Glauser, is the new CEO of EVIO labs since recent William\u2019s departure. She is also the co-founder of EVIO, and her track record from previous organizational experience suggest she has more than enough capability to run and take this business forward. She worked at IBM, and most recently at EY (the BIG 4) and consulted various utility executives of multinational organizations. Since being appointed, she started picking up the pieces and is preparing the organization for growth in 2021 and beyond. She has built a completely new SLT (women led), that are currently settling in their roles. Here below are milestones she achieved so far suggesting so.\n\n**Evidenced Milestones**\n\n* New website, 2020 - [https://hemptesting.com/](https://hemptesting.com/)\n* Management transition, January / February 2021\n* Lab Facility Upgrades, March 2021 (you can see the pictures on her FB profile and IG)\n* Getting verified on OTC, March 2021 (OTC official website)\n* New contract with $CBDL, March 2021\n* These step-by-step milestone achievements suggest to me they are looking to turnaround in 2021 which was also raised by EVIO SLT previously suggesting they anticipate full recovery in this fiscal year.\n\n**Sociability Factor**\n\nThese guys have quite a large following across social media platforms, however, have been quite inactive, which of course is expected as of my previously raised concerns. Although, this is expected to change over the next couple of months when Lori finally gets the core business objectives achieved like SEC filings and removing the STOP sign.\n\nThis is already becoming evident based on their recent Facebook (FB) and Instagram (IG) post updating followers on their lab developments, changes to SLT and responding to investor questions. You can also view their upgraded lab facilities via FB and IG.\n\nPlease also note there is a website called ***\u201cOTCBBSTOCKNEWS\u201d*** that is spreading false news, so please ignore news updates from them.\n\n* IG - [https://www.instagram.com/evio\\_labs/](https://www.instagram.com/evio_labs/)\n* Facebook - [https://www.facebook.com/eviolabs/](https://www.facebook.com/eviolabs/)\n* Twitter - [https://twitter.com/eviolabs](https://twitter.com/eviolabs)\n* LinkedIn - [https://www.linkedin.com/company/eviolabs/](https://www.linkedin.com/company/eviolabs/)\n\n**Senior Leadership Team (SLT)**\n\nAs mentioned in the above EVIO Labs had a complete sweep through their previous SLT to such extent that it is now all woman led. Management transition has only just taken place around Jan/Feb timeframe. I think this is a good step in direction towards diversity and inclusion and likewise demonstrates an attempt for a turnaround. Photos of SLT can be viewed on FB post as I found that not everyone has LinkedIn profiles.\n\n**Lori Glauser, MBA - CEO**\n\nMs. Glauser co-founded EVIO (previously Signal Bay) in 2014 as an advisory services firm, which has evolved to become a multi-state operator of analytical testing laboratories. Lori is also the founding chair of Women Grow \u2013 Las Vegas, served on FOCUS standards committee, co-author of Medical Marijuana Desk Reference, and continues to provide advisory services to entrepreneurs.\n\nLori has 25 years prior experience in engineering, management consulting, and start-ups. Her expertise lies in business planning and operations, business process design, financial forecasting, risk, customer experience, and regulatory and policy. Ms. Glauser previously worked with **Ernst &amp; Young, IBM, and Financial Times Group**. She also launched two startups. Lori has a BS in Mechanical Engineering from the University of New Hampshire and an MBA from University of Alabama.\n\nLinkedIn - [https://www.linkedin.com/in/loriglauser/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/loriglauser/)\n\n**Kawai Medeiros - Lab Director**\n\n**Claudia Crouse - Operations and HR**\n\n**Kathryn Darby \u2013 VP Client Services**\n\n**Svetlana Ageyava - Lab Director**\n\n**Sara Garcia - Operations Manager**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nEVIO labs was a successful start-up, growing, expanding, and become the number one in CBD and Hemp testing and consulting services, resulting in increasing revenue year on year. However, Covid-19 has impacted the business greatly, including a lawsuit, forcing the organization to re-structure, sell assets and dilute some shares. Although, the new CEO has started to pick up the pieces to ensure 2021 acts as a pivotal year to resume and maintain the brand image.\n\n**References**\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cbd-life-sciences-inc-cbdl-110000869.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cbd-life-sciences-inc-cbdl-110000869.html)\n\n[https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/EVIO/security](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/EVIO/security)\n\n[https://sec.report/CIK/0000715788](https://sec.report/CIK/0000715788)\n\n[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200915005498/en/EVIO-Inc.-Provides-Shareholder-Update](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200915005498/en/EVIO-Inc.-Provides-Shareholder-Update)\n\n[https://ksusentinel.com/2021/03/23/cannabis-testing-services-market-projected-to-witness-a-double-digit-cagr-during-2020-to-2026-coherent-market-insights/](https://ksusentinel.com/2021/03/23/cannabis-testing-services-market-projected-to-witness-a-double-digit-cagr-during-2020-to-2026-coherent-market-insights/)",

I\u2019ll summarise below:\n\n3 main reasons why I like this stock (GME puns end here):\n\n* Overall semiconductor market future\n* Finances and balance sheet\n* Cathie Wood investment\n\n2 possible downsides:\n\n* Low future earnings forecasts\n* Recent price volatility\n\n# Future\n\nAlmost everything requires a semiconductor now, and that will only grow further in the future, some of the biggest examples are:\n\n* The majority of mobile phones sold nowadays are smartphones, and while that growth has slowed down over the last few years, 1.5 billion a year are still sold.\n* The ecosystem surrounding mobile phones is growing rapidly, think tablets, smart watches, headphones, laptops, speakers.\n* Internet-of-things devices are booming, think Alexa, smart lighting, ovens, fridges,heating, mirrors etc.\n* Car technology (especially in electric cars) is mostly driven by semiconductor technology, shifting further and further away from analog technology\n* Gaming, from Playstations to VR headsets, again all require semiconductor technology\n* Automated manufacturing\n\nEven without COVID, supply cannot keep up. There have been huge shortages this year for semiconductors causing pinches everywhere *(have you tried purchasing a PS5 recently?)* meaning lots of pent-up demand, even without, a number of HUGE factories have been built or will be built that are expected to ramp up supply. examples of those:\n\n* [Samsung\u2019s $17bn factory](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/319926-samsung-files-documents-to-build-new-17-billion-fab-in-the-united-states)\n* [TSM\u2019s $12bn plant](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/15/taiwan-semiconductor-to-build-a-12-billion-chip-pl.aspx)\n* [Intel\u2019s $7bn plant, completed in 2020](https://hexus.net/tech/news/cpu/145990-intel-fab-42-now-ready-pump-leading-edge-products/)\n* [List of all current fabrication plants to give you an idea of size of market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_semiconductor_fabrication_plants)\n\nAll of this will require automation and testing.\n\nLong-term, it\u2019s very safe to assume that irrespective of economic or technological shifts, semiconductor demand will not only sustain, but surge. A few things on the horizon that will likely affect this:\n\n* 5G technology being rolled out worldwide\n* Space technology &amp; tourism growth\n* AI &amp; data technology\n\nThe biggest kicker? Teradyne provide the majority of the automation and testing for all of these sectors, meaning any growth here only benefits them.\n\nFurthermore, to me they are also proofed from the whole *\u201ceconomy opening up means a move away from tech\u201c* as it\u2019s not like people will stop using electronic devices, unlike companies like Zoom which will see a big drop in usership as normality returns.\n\n# Finances\n\nEven during a COVID year, Teradyne grew revenues from $2.29bn to $3.12bn, an increase of 36%.\n\nThey grew their net income even further, going from $467m to $784m, an increase of 67%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 0i9lfxyo8ln61...*\n\nEarnings per share *(profit by number of shares)* also grew, from $2.6 to $4.28 (**+64%**) last year which is astounding. (*general consensus is anything above 25% growth is good).*\n\nWhen taking the price of the stock into account, and looking at Price-to-Earnings ratio *(Price of the stock vs the earnings per share of a stock, the lower the better)* Teradyne has a PE ratio of 24.9x, which is way better than the industry average of 38x.\n\nFrom a debt position, Teradyne is very healthy with an equity-to-debt ratio *(the lower the better, below 1 means more equity than debt)* of 0.18.\n\nCathie Wood Investment\n\nCathie Wood, the very aggressive bullish investor whos ETF [ARK Invest](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ARKK/performance/) saw returns of 152% last year, [has recently purchased a further 139,619 shares](https://247wallst.com/investing/2021/03/12/cathie-woods-ark-invest-buys-and-sells-3-12/) to add to the current position.\n\nExtra purchasing here shows long-term confidence, as this was added after ARK had to rebalance and sell some Teradyne shares last year.\n\nPossible Downsides\n\nSome analysts are predicting modest future revenue growth at 5.8%, compared to the industry average of 16.2%.\n\nFurthermore, the price this year has seen some large volatility, suffering from the sell-off that affected technology and growth stocks earlier this year. If more sell-offs ensue, this could cause the price to drop further in the short term.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img gobsit0q8ln61...*\n\n# Summary\n\nTeradyne commands a large portion of a market that is only growing further every year. A financially healthy and well managed company, with high revenue and EPS growth, along with some strong investment backing. While there may be some volatility in the price of the stock short-term, long-term this company still has tremendous potential.\n\n*None of this is investment advice, please do your own research before taking out any positions.*",

        "selftext": "ZEST (Ecoark), is coming up soon to be a good play for those interested in seeing Walmart take an L. Eden, their program they use to track produce was stolen from Ecoark as a replica of their ZEST technologies. Walmart and Ecoark has a contract which used the ZEST technology to track said produce, until Walmart discarded their contract and came out with Eden directly after terminating the contract.  \nThe trial was set for June 2020, but was move to the end of March 2021 due to Cov-SAR. You can (an should always) do your own due diligence on the protrack website which shows the court documentation. With text messages between corporate leaders, and the timing of everything that came about of Eden, it seems as if Walmart had their hand in the cookie jar and was caught.   \nBasically when the settlement occurs (which is the best way for Walmart to keep using Eden), the amount won get spread between stock holders  in their share price. A small $15/ share could be a retirement fund for someone looking for a home run.   \n\n\nPlease do your own due diligence, but I have done mine and have been in this over a year.   \n\n\nIBM was also involved which will result in a second lawsuit later on when Walmart had IBM help tweak the ZEST technology, so it would not be one lawsuit, but a second that could help the price go up a second time.",

He talks America needing software(pure software/AI) that is the best to AVOID conflict in order to stay ahead of America's adversaries. Basically he's claiming Palantir Technologies to be S class disruptive Tech that can lead future innovations for America.\n\nKarp would rather put his focus on having the company put its \"best foot forward\" for the sake of protecting America and its private and public interests.\n\nHe was asked in the middle of the interview \"How would he entice new commercial customers?\"\n\nHe then starts talking about the how Foundry and Gotham are unique technically speaking ( claims his tech is 5 years ahead of everyone else low key), and the way they do business is unique.  For example he explains that Palantir  in the commercial space, Foundry is a Finished product as opposed to other ERP systems that require you to do an entire IT installation that can take months.  Foundry can be installed as a whole stack in a few days!  That difference is how Karp and Palantir thinks Software companies will sell their products.  He mentions that typically ERP systems entice customers with Jargon that promises to deliver instead of providing a product that stands out from the rest.  He truly believes Palantir is in a class of its own.   He actually believes despite having Elite tech that he provides for the biggest companies in the word, he thinks that Palantir can provide a ton of value to smaller to medium companies by offering superior ERP Software transforming their business to save them millions of dollars.\n\nThey talk little bit about PLTRs partnerships including 3M, BP, IBM, and AWS.  They talk about how IBM and AWS were thought to be rival companies to Palantir but instead decided to join forces because those companies understand how difficult it is to build what Palantir built with Foundry and Gotham.\n\nHE LIKES THE RETAIL INVESTORS, he HATES the \"INVESTORS\" who buy and sell the stock who don't have any clue about the company or its Tech.\n\nHe can't on camera \"PUMP\" the stock, so he just talks about how he's more focused on building the Company for the long-term.\n\nTLDR\n\nSo about a fucking hour talking about how superior the tech( Foundry/Gotham) is compared to any other software company's tech and how Karps ideological view of supporting America and its western values by providing Superiority and Complexity in order to stay ahead of its adversaries.\n\nFoundry is 5 years ahead of any other ERP software in the market.  IBM and AWS bow down to PLTR.\n\nIntrigued yet?\n\nI plan to hold this 10 years plus.\n\n235 shares@ 24.68, 6x  PLTR 4/1 30c",

(*general consensus is anything above 25% growth is good).*\n\nWhen taking the price of the stock into account, and looking at Price-to-Earnings ratio *(Price of the stock vs the earnings per share of a stock, the lower the better)* Teradyne has a PE ratio of 24.9x, which is way better than the industry average of 38x.\n\nFrom a debt position, Teradyne is very healthy with an equity-to-debt ratio *(the lower the better, below 1 means more equity than debt)* of 0.18.\n\n### Cathie Wood Investment\n\nCathie Wood, the very aggressive bullish investor whos ETF [ARK Invest](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ARKK/performance/) saw returns of 152% last year, [has recently purchased a further 139,619 shares](https://247wallst.com/investing/2021/03/12/cathie-woods-ark-invest-buys-and-sells-3-12/) to add to the current position.\n\nExtra purchasing here shows long-term confidence, as this was added after ARK had to rebalance and sell some Teradyne shares last year.\n\n### Possible Downsides\n\nSome analysts are predicting modest future revenue growth at 5.8%, compared to the industry average of 16.2%.\n\nFurthermore, the price this year has seen some large volatility, suffering from the sell-off that affected technology and growth stocks earlier this year. If more sell-offs ensue, this could cause the price to drop further in the short term.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Choppy price action for TER this year, dropping from all time highs of $148.](https://preview.redd.it/e5rxrx48aln61.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27d012a19c15c1664614c9c953adcee881b4020f)\n\n### Summary\n\nTeradyne commands a large portion of a market that is only growing further every year. A financially healthy and well managed company, with high revenue and EPS growth, along with some strong investment backing. While there may be some volatility in the price of the stock short-term, long-term this company still has tremendous potential.",

        "selftext": "Karp's interview is being overblown.  The headlines are clickbait.  He talks America needing software(pure software/AI) that is the best to AVOID conflict in order to stay ahead of America's adversaries. Basically he's claiming Palantir Technologies to be S class disruptive Tech that can lead future innovations for America.\n\nKarp would rather put his focus on having the company put its \"best foot forward\" for the sake of protecting America and its private and public interests.\n\nHe was asked in the middle of the interview \"How would he entice new commercial customers?\"\n\nHe then starts talking about the how Foundry and Gotham are unique technically speaking ( claims his tech is 5 years ahead of everyone else low key), and the way they do business is unique.  For example he explains that Palantir  in the commercial space, Foundry is a Finished product as opposed to other ERP systems that require you to do an entire IT installation that can take months.  Foundry can be installed as a whole stack in a few days!  That difference is how Karp and Palantir thinks Software companies will sell their products.  He mentions that typically ERP systems entice customers with Jargon that promises to deliver instead of providing a product that stands out from the rest.  He truly believes Palantir is in a class of its own.   He actually believes despite having Elite tech that he provides for the biggest companies in the word, he thinks that Palantir can provide a ton of value to smaller to medium companies by offering superior ERP Software transforming their business to save them millions of dollars.\n\nThey talk little bit about PLTRs partnerships including 3M, BP, IBM, and AWS.  They talk about how IBM and AWS were thought to be rival companies to Palantir but instead decided to join forces because those companies understand how difficult it is to build what Palantir built with Foundry and Gotham.\n\nHE LIKES THE RETAIL INVESTORS, he HATES the \"INVESTORS\" who buy and sell the stock who don't have any clue about the company or its Tech.\n\nHe can't on camera \"PUMP\" the stock, so he just talks about how he's more focused on building the Company for the long-term.\n\nTLDR\n\nSo about a fucking hour talking about how superior the tech( Foundry/Gotham) is compared to any other software company's tech and how Karps ideological view of supporting America and its western values by providing Superiority and Complexity in order to stay ahead of its adversaries.\n\nFoundry is 5 years ahead of any other ERP software in the market.  IBM and AWS bow down to PLTR.\n\nIntrigued yet?\n\nI plan to hold this 10 years plus.\n\n235 shares@ 24.68, 6x  PLTR 4/1 30c",
