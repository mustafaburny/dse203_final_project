        "selftext": "RKT - Earnings tomorrow and short interest is now at 41%!\n\nRocket mortgage reports earnings tomorrow after the bell. Rocket is currently the largest mortgage brokerage platform (Fintech) in the industry.  They currently have about 9% of the space and are projecting 25% within 5 years. \n\nReports from the CEO teased that they are partnering with the largest financial institution. Rumor suggest Berkshire since they are the largest. Their partner ships with companies like Intuit have dramatically grown their revenues so I expect the \u201clargest financial institution\u201d to dramatically boost their forecasts. \n\nNov 2020 their announced a 1 billion dollar buyback option that lasts 2 years.  I\u2019m not sure they will need to execute the buyback but this shows the board of directors they are serious about killing off this short fund.  \n\nOver the last 6 months this stock has been channel traded as hedge funds like BlackRock recently doubled their positions.  \n\nIt pattern trades 3-4 day spikes followed by 10-15 days declines with a solid support at $20. \n\nToday the short interest reported showed an increase to 41%.  With 5 days to cover.  This is insanely high.  \n\nLet me preface I\u2019m not advocating a squeeze im just simply giving my opinion on above news will cause. I believe RKT was attacked by the same short funds shorting all meme stocks as this was the darling back when it IPO\u2019d in here and got smacked down by shorts.  Back then short interest was at mid 20\u2019s when it spiked to $35.  \n\nThe big complaint was that 10 year treasuries were rising and inflation will kill mortgage stocks.  Powell spoke today and said they would try to keep rates low around 2% for a long time. \n\nToday\u2019s housing report showed a surprise of 4% new home purchases vs .9% projected.  This is a huge beat and only fuels suspicions that Rocket will have a massive quarter report. \n\nRocket has the best refinance / return customer of any company.  They have a 70% refinance rate because they track their customers logging In to their account.  The industry avg is 23%.  \n\nThe one downside is the 8% economic interest the A shares have.  If rocket grows their projected 25% market share then their value is somewhere around $40-$60 in my opinion.  If they maintain 10% market share then they shouldn\u2019t be worth more than the $20 they have now.  Might be the reason a short hedge fund is piling on them to halt their growth.  Maybe a competitor.  Speculating so I digress. \n\nWhen looking at the chart.  Look at the strength at holding $20.  Is this a moon shot, probably not... However with the volatility happening in GME and AMC I believe any pressure put on RKT shorts will force them to cover while the market piles in because this is a damn good company being held down by a hedgie bastard.",

        "selftext": "Hello r/pennystocks community,  \n\n\nThis post is meant to address ETFM/FOMO Corp hypothetical concerns which arise when considering the safety of any penny stock - is this a P&amp;D? Is this thing going to crash immediately? It will touch on the following:  \n\n\n1) Motivations for Posting - The Problem of establishing confidence in upward trends\n\n2) Recent History of ETFM/FOMO corp stock price movement - How did we get to the recent green?\n\n3) Reflecting on recent volume data according to the recent P&amp;D test methodology posted last week by u/alexsmith2332 (here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ljj57a/how\\_to\\_recognize\\_a\\_pump\\_and\\_dump/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ljj57a/how_to_recognize_a_pump_and_dump/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) )  \n\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a professional. I am not a financial adviser. I have limited experience trading penny stocks. I have no formal training in these matters. Do not interpret this post as financial advisory.\n\n**1) Motivations for Posting**\n\nThose who have and will read my posts may notice I have commented a few times on this forum in my efforts to find, consolidate, and present my research on ETFM/FOMO Corp.\n\nI myself, though only several months into the penny stock game, find myself continually trying to answer the question of \\*reliability\\* with respect to my picks. Thus far, I have avoided getting myself stuck in penny situations which result in losses. However, a streak of continued success, I intuit, is all the more reason to be skeptical.\n\nThat being said, this post is not exactly a DD, as there are several good DDs out there on this sub (not referring to my small updates) and even on video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u\\_rAPq83kn4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_rAPq83kn4)\n\nThus, this post is meant to directly evaluate the recent price movement and whether it is the result of a P&amp;D.\n\n**2) ETFM/FOMO recent price movement - How did we get to the green?**\n\nIn order to make sense of ETFM/FOMO Corp's current pricing, it is necessary to take a look at its price history over the past few years. This is in line with u/alexsmith2332 's recommendation: \"look to the left.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[5 Year](https://preview.redd.it/vguy025s8nh61.jpg?width=217&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f14680234e3ae5f88f4b1395a4a814d556601e0a)\n\nGoing back to 2015, when the company was still an EV company by the name of 2050 Motors, we can see a volatile, yet steady downward trend into an abyss of dereliction by 2017. There, largely, the company's price remained at an abysmal .0001 USD/share (or less) until Fall 2020 with little movement occurring with a notable exception at the news of Vik Grover's accession to the position of CEO in March 2019.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img tygi22mu8nh61...*\n\nHowever, in Fall 2020, beginning in September, we can see the stock price come back to life (though not necessarily dramatically) coinciding the company statements regarding their acquisition of Purge Virus, AGILE, and their rebranding and self-reinvention as FOMO Corp - an incubator for innovative technologies primarily - but not exclusively - related to high-intensity light sanitation and disinfection technologies.  \n\n\n*Processing img ud28d2iw8nh61...*\n\nThe 6-month chart shows a very slight upward aggregate trend in share price dotted by four moderate to large price spikes and regressions - Sept, Oct, Nov 2020 and Jan 2021. These spikes appear to coincide with company news bear the characteristic heart-monitor pattern that P&amp;Ds can often hold.  \n\n\n*Processing img ftr62kfy8nh61...*\n\nThis brings us to our most recent price increase here in Feb 2021 which is much more pronounced than any of the others and has largely been sustained in an increasing upward trend for the past two weeks.  \n\n\n3) Volume reflections\n\nSo now we've laid out our data. Let's apply some analysis and answer our question: is this a P&amp;D? In light of u/alexsmith2332 's recommendations in his post here: \\[insert\\] , we will look at the relation between price fluctuations and trading volume. I now draw my attention to several key price points which I outlined for myself in section 2, namely Sept, Oct, Nov 2020, Jan and Feb 2021.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSept 2020\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 5qxi2yp0anh61...*\n\nWe can see an abrupt jump in stock price here which appears to coincide with the company coming back to life from a largely derelict status. This point marks the beginning of ETFM/FOMO corp's acquisition and debt elimination program, coinciding with their planned and then actualized acquisition of Purge Virus. Investment interest appears to have kicked up with this news and company action.  \n\n\nOct, Nov, Jan 2021\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8tll4i82anh61.jpg?width=295&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f78295c463343e0ac99dd0462c1894955e1cb187\n\nTogether with Sept, these round-date price point data represent large spikes (at least 100% value increases) followed by steep regressions to the mean ultimately resulting in share valuations approximately 10-20% higher than the price points preceding the spikes. In each of these examples, trading volume skyrocketed approximately 20x volume levels of the preceding day with near-equivalent volume accompanying the spikes on the day following the volume and price spikes, yet with counterbalancing decrease in share valuation instead of increase.\n\nAt each of these points, this could read, much as outlined in r/alexsmith2332 's post, like archetypal P&amp;D movement.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\***HOWEVER\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\***\n\nFeb 2021\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m2ghsqn3anh61.jpg?width=157&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d13af28225dd8b7e9390389e95ba6474026b820\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur final and most recent price movement - far more dramatic in its upward movement than any of the prior price points - bears two characteristics that separate it from these earlier four identified points.\n\n1) Unlike the earlier spikes in share valuation which rose and sank over the course of a single day, the upward movement experienced since the beginning of February 2021 has compounded and been sustained over the course of a 10-14 day interval.\n\n2) The Sept-Jan price spikes were accompanied by intense 1-2 spikes in trading volume. The past 10-14 days in upward price movement, despite being more dramatic in absolute value of share price increase, do not represent an aberrant spike in trading volume corresponding to share price increase. Indeed, trading volume has increased, but trading volume has increased gradually, suggesting that recent price movement has corresponded to genuinely bullish appraisal of share valuation compared to momentary valuation spikes and drop-offs from sensationalism.\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nSo does this mean ETFM/FOMO is headed to the moon? I don't know.\n\nDoes this mean ETFM/FOMO is not being pumped for an imminent dump? I don't know.\n\n**Well, what do you know, then?** \\- The data which I have laid out above - and which I have examined for my own benefit, potential profit, and peace of mind - suggest one thing with certainty: \n\nAt least as our data stand now, the volume and price movement relationships in Feb 2021 DO NOT match sensationalist-archetypal volume-price spike patterns, nor do they match those pattern correlates which were present during the Sept, Oct, Nov 2020, and Jan 2021 dramatic price movements in ETFM/FOMO Corp. \n\nThis does not necessarily mean I am \\*certain\\* this is not happening now across a greater frame of reference. This is potentially the case and we won't know whether that is indeed occurring on a 1-month vs 1-day scale until more time has passed. To paraphrase Kierkegaard: Life is a process that can only be understood in reverse, but must be lived forward.\n\nSo how can I make a reasonable decision about buying/selling/HODLing, etc.? - I can't advise you to take any particular course of action or make any particular decision. I can, however, share my decision-making process. \n\nAs a current investor in ETFM/FOMO corp, the recent relationship between price and volume data as I have compared them to prior relationships (at the data points I have discussed above) and to archetypal relationships (as outlined in u/alexsmith2332 's post) suggests to me that currently ETFM/FOMO corp does not appear subject to P&amp;D-type activity. Additionally, recent DD information - company news, CEO updates, company document analysis - increases my own confidence in my discernment of the current situation. This does not make it certain, but it does provide additional information that - at least for now - corroborates my interpretation.\n\nThat being said, I am always looking for new information to either prove my prior interpretations wrong or confirm my fundamental presuppositions for another day.\n\nWith all this taken into consideration, at the very least I am happy to have performed this as an exercise in the hopes it will improve my decision-making as a trader and investor. I am open to comments, concerns, and any potential flaws in this very elementary examination of these data. I hope, in no matter what context, this thinking process may serve as useful to the general community and make us all wiser and sounder in the days ahead.  \n\n\nYours",

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/smallstreetbets sub! Welcome to Wednesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Wednesday, February 24th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/24/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-24-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Stocks set to rise after Tuesday\u2019s turnaround on Wall Street\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures rose on Wednesday, a day after Wall Street\u2019s wild ride that saw the Nasdaq claw back nearly all of a nearly 4% loss to close down just 0.5%. The S&amp;P 500 reversed a 1.8% decline to close up slightly, breaking a five-session losing streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average wiped about a drop of 360 points, or more than 1%, to close modestly higher for the third straight session.\n\n&gt; * Tuesday\u2019s turnaround, especially in tech stocks, came after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told the Senate Banking Committee that inflation is still \u201csoft\u201d and the economic outlook is still \u201chighly uncertain\u201d due to the pandemic. That eased fears of a central bank policy change. Powell appears before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday in the second and final part of his mandated semiannual economic testimony to Congress.\n\n&gt; * The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s staff endorsed Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use, a critical step in bringing a third shot to the U.S. marketplace. The staff report is meant to brief the FDA\u2019s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, which will meet Friday to review J&amp;J\u2019s request for emergency use authorization.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. Tesla bounces and a fund manager with a hot-hand may be the reason\n\n&gt; * Tesla rose more than 4% in premarket trading after staging a major comeback Tuesday. At one point, as bitcoin prices sank, shares plunged 13%. By the close, it recouped most of those losses to finish down only nearly 2.2%. However, Tesla\u2019s four-session slide did total more than 11%, dragging the high-flying stock into the red by nearly 1% for 2021. Over the past 12 months, it was still up a whopping 287%.\n\n&gt; * Ark Invest\u2019s Cathie Wood, who\u2019s had a hot hand recently, scooped up more than $120 million worth of Tesla shares during Tuesday\u2019s rout and subsequent comeback. Wood\u2019s buying may have helped spark the Tuesday turnaround in Tesla. CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer tweeted that \u201cCathie puts the bottom in Tesla!\u201d\n\n&gt; * Wood told Bloomberg Radio on Tuesday she\u2019s particularly bullish on Tesla\u2019s ride-hailing service as a bridge to autonomous driving. \u201cWe do not think many analysts are giving Tesla credit for autonomous. If they were, the stock would be a lot higher,\u201d he added.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. Bitcoin rebounds, surging back above $50,000\n\n&gt; * Wood, also a bitcoin bull, told Bloomberg, \u201d\u201cWe\u2019re very positive on Bitcoin, very happy to see a healthy correction here, no market is straight up.\u201d Bitcoin climbed back above the $50,000 on Wednesday, after a brutal sell-off earlier this week. Bitcoin is up more than 70% year-to-date and over 400% in the last 12 months.\n\n&gt; * Square said Tuesday it bought $170 million worth bitcoin. The fintech firm, run by Jack Dorsey who\u2019s also CEO of Twitter, bought $50 million worth of the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency last year. Dorsey, one of bitcoin\u2019s most well-known proponents, once predicted it would eventually become the \u201csingle currency\u201d of the internet.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. GameStop CFO to step down after Reddit-driven stock rally\n\n&gt; * GameStop CFO Jim Bell will step down next month. The video game retailer said Bell\u2019s resignation was not due to any disagreement with the company relating to its operations, including accounting principles and practices. However, a source told Reuters that Bell\u2019s exit was unrelated to the recent Reddit-fueled wild swings in GameStop\u2019s stock. However, the source said his departure was initiated by GameStop, in a sign he was not viewed as the right fit as the retailer transitions into a tech-oriented business.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5.

Adjusted quarterly earnings of $1.33 per share on revenue of $20.31 billion both beat expectations. Lowe\u2019s reiterated the forecast it gave at an investor day in December. Chief Financial Officer David Denton had said home improvement sales will likely decline in 2021 as more people get Covid-19 vaccines and spend more time outside their homes.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/fi9hqg4.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Wi0fT78.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.postimg.cc/MTzr3NG5/econcal1.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/TIhMYEf.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/7Bu1KiL.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/uT5kxuP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.postimg.cc/fy84vZjY/eram0111.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/EierTCy.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/0bTAqfb.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/iXLEMTe.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/2Uo3hJ6.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/B6Gxyy4.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/pdRZP8tX/upgradesdowngrades1.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/wjh2K2ZG/upgradesdowngrades2.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/wjK2bZfN/upgradesdowngrades3.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/wgGUiRC.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/am9gbmC.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* WKHS\n* JMIA\n* FRSX\n* SQ\n* RTP\n* OSK\n* SOAC\n* FSR\n* RMGB\n* SNAP\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/24/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-lowes-gamestop-square-intuit-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Lowe\u2019s (LOW)** \u2013 The home improvement retailer reported quarterly profit of $1.33 per share, 12 cents a share above estimates.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, February 24, 2021**\n\nStocks rose on Wednesday, with each of the three major indices closing the day positive. Shares of technology companies, which were hit the hardest by the pullback, shook earlier losses, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) closing 0.82% higher. \n\nIn the past week, the rotation from high-flying growth stocks into cyclical and value investments picked up steam as fears of higher Treasury yields pressured stocks across the board this week, with higher prices and increased borrowing costs for companies seen as an emerging threat for high valuation companies. \n\nDuring his semiannual testimony on monetary policy, Chair of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell said that rising Treasury yields are, \u201ca statement of confidence on the part of markets that we\u2019ll have a robust and ultimately complete recovery\u201d. As a reminder, Treasury yields are the total amount of money you earn by owning U.S. Treasury bills, notes, bonds or inflation-protected securities. The U.S. Department of the Treasury sells them to pay for the US debt and when the timeframe of the note expires, the government pays back the face value plus states interest. Essentially, Powell is saying that Treasury yields are going up because investors believe in the US\u2019 ability to pay back the interest of those yields when the time expires, which implies the economy will recover.\n\nIn his remarks, Powell reaffirmed that the Federal Reserve was looking to maintain its current accommodative policy posturing for the time being, keeping benchmark rates near zero and asset purchases at the current pace of $120 billion per month. He said, \"The economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved. We will continue to clearly communicate our assessment of progress toward our goals well in advance of any change in the pace of purchases.\" Supportive monetary policy from the Federal Reserve is one of the reasons we think the factors are in place for a sustained bull market even after the pandemic is over. While there are certainly short-term headwinds in the market, our long-term outlook remains bullish.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Incredible, in the last few hours of the market, \u201cmeme stocks\u201d like AMC and Gamestop (GME) gapped up strongly. Including after-hours movement, GME is up more than 120% on the day at the time of writing. This really is Psycho!!\n* President Joe Biden will sign an executive order on Wednesday aimed at addressing a global semiconductor chip shortage that has forced U.S. automakers and other manufacturers to cut production. The order will launch a 100-day review of supply chains for four critical products: semiconductor chips, large-capacity batteries for electric vehicles, rare earth minerals, and pharmaceuticals.\n* After the recent pullback in Tesla (TSLA), Cathie Woods, portfolio manager at ARK Investments, upped the bet on Tesla by $121 million in her ETF ARKK, the top-performing ETF of last year. We\u2019re huge fans of Cathie Woods here at PsychoTrader, we pay attention when she does something. We think you should as well. \n* U.S. new home sales jumped by 4.3% in January over December, the [Commerce Department reported Wednesday ](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf)morning, far exceeding expectations as a jump in housing market activity last year extended into the beginning of the new year. We have been banging the table on mortgage REITs for a while now, still way below pre-pandemic levels and a great long-term opportunity in our view.\n* The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said Johnson &amp; Johnson's (JNJ) single-shot COVID-19 vaccine appeared safe and effective in trials, paving the road for the third vaccine to receive emergency use authorization in the US.\n* Despite a recent video showing one of their engines catching on fire, shares of Boeing (BA) gapped up today.\n* Dell Tech (DELL) target raised by JP Morgan (JPM) from $85 to $90 at Overweight. Stock currently around $80\n* Intuit (INTU) with two target raises. Stock currently around $400\n   * Wells Fargo (WFC) from $440 to $450\n   * Stifel Nicolaus from $400 to $425\n* Jazz Pharma (JAZZ) with two target raises.

Stock currently around $109. Shares of Workhorse (WKHS) another company that was vying for the same contract, plummeted on the news.\n* Nordson (NDSN) target raised by Wells Fargo (WFC) from $220 to $230 at Overweight. Stock currently around $188\n* Palo Alto Networks (PANW) target raised by Argus from $10 to $440 at Buy. Stock currently around $378\n* Snapchat (SNAP) with a host of positive target raises.

It features unprecedented safety for disinfecting PPE while remaining safe on skin.\n* Clyraguard is [available](https://www.amazon.com/Clyraguard-Personal-Protection-Spray-mineral-based/dp/B08JNFJ38F/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=JZWQMUZGCA0K&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=clyraguard%2Bhospital-grade%2C%2Bfda-registered%2C%2Bppe%2Bdisinfectant%2Bspray&amp;psc=1&amp;qid=1608239102&amp;source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyWVlSOTdBS1k5QzVTJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNDg4OTE4MUY1REJTVERNVldVNyZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwODkyNTg4MTZQTTNYSDQ0Qk5TJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ&amp;sprefix=clyragu%2Caps%2C286&amp;sr=8-1-spons) on Amazon and other distribution channels and early sales are just beginning (NOTE FROM MODERATOR - PUT ON HOLD WHILE WORKING ON LABEL EXPANSION)\n* BioLargo also developed disruptive solutions for the giant water treatment industry, stormwater, and food processing industries and the company reports it is getting ready to deliver its first AOS Water Treatment System valued at $500,000 and has a major commercial pilot underway with a leading municipality in Montreal\n* BioLargo\u2019s growth and sales trajectory are pointing to positive net cash flow in well under one year\n* Positive net cash flow would immediately reduce or eliminate the need for raising additional operating capital from convertible lenders that has a history of depressing the share price. We believe the supply of shares that have been sold into the market from convertible note sellers has created a remarkable buying opportunity today\n* With Pros heavily outweighing the Cons, BioResearchAlert finds BioLargo shares highly attractive and undervalued. Perhaps most importantly we find that investment timing couldn\u2019t be better than now because the company\u2019s sales are growing at a pace that is very close to achieving positive net cash flow that will work to reduce the supply of shares and increase buying. All factors are converging and pointing to substantially higher prices in the near term and for the long haul\n\nSavvy investors know from experience that one of the biggest investment challenges is timing. Almost every publicly traded company has a story so good that it entices many investors, but the two most obvious questions that always seem to pop up are; First, will they succeed? And second, WHEN? Experienced investors know only too well the importance of timing. After all, the amount of time spent in any investment is directly related to the real Return On Investment or \u201cROI\u201d. And ROI is always measured in units of time - typically one year.\n\nA deep dive into BioLargo, Inc. (BLGO: OTCQB) demonstrates a company that has spent several long and challenging years, and approximately $25 million building the company while developing technologies that are finally now ready for prime-time commercialization.\n\nFast forward to today. Their first successful commercial product is called CupriDyne Clean that in 2016 was introduced to the Waste Handling and Cannabis industries. Competing odor control products work by masking problematic odors with an overpowering scent of lemon or cherry or some other acceptable smell. Odor masking does not eliminate the source of the problem, but CupriDyne Clean actually breaks down the odor causing compounds for complete elimination. When witnessed in person it\u2019s simply amazing.\n\nThis recent short [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link&amp;v=ReI9CB0eluE) presentation at the most recent LD Micro Investor Conference is a definite must for serious investors. It highlights BioLargo\u2019s impressive progress and how close they are to busting out on their way to becoming a unicorn with their first $1 billion market capitalization.\n\nThe following illustrations, charts, and product descriptions were presented at this conference:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/26wk9mqo7qj61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b90e432766d37997da8635874e00423bdf89f94\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g91peiur7qj61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a2a1a541720370772c9dbad8b922d2ae1bb333f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4d4zvz0w7qj61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eff6d1eb3ba645385a309a16deaa2673557ebe72\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b68g5bxx7qj61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b45a5f96f9a91c25e6263efca30f2b163314cec\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/41wynjpz7qj61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46feb8259eae0b7417f5b91771a3914c8506dbb4\n\n**Investment Pros**\n\nManagement has proven they are committed and has navigated an incredible journey to develop unrivaled proprietary products for very large markets. Their financials are improving and their timing to market ranges from now to the very short-term horizon.\n\n**Investment Cons**\n\nThe company will have to pick partners very carefully, uplist to the larger NASDAQ market, and once they generate positive cash flow, they will require additional capital to accelerate their growth trajectory.\n\nESG or Green Tech Investments\n\nBioLarge is an outstanding ESG company and #ESG or #GreenTech Investments are becoming an integral part of a preponderance of institutional and individual investors. Following is a partial list of ESG tickers: \u00a0EW, EQIX, POD, EME, CDNS, NRC, NED, MSFT, HAS, OC, HD, MLHR, ORA, TXN, BFAM, CRM, AMAT, KEYS, WST, DECK, IDXX, CPB, CBRE, PWR, ES, PG, RMD, A, AXTA, GOOG, MKC, VRTX, TNDM, KSU, SRE, GIS, AMGN, TNET, GWW, TROW, ADBE, BWXT, MMC, PEAK, ACM, PEP, INTU, CMI, WAT, MEI, AMPE, GAXY, INO, SRNE, MRNA, HTBX, IBIO, VXRT, VBIV, ONTX, TNXP, CODX, NVAX, VIR, APT\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe believe BioLargo\u2019s share price of $.14 per share and market cap of $30 million represents an exceptionally well-timed investment opportunity. With the company decisively shifting gears from R&amp;D to launching disruptive products to fill large market needs and convertible debt financing coming to a close, we foresee rising share prices beginning very shortly and continuing for years to come. BioLargo is a very impressive company that after a long and challenging development cycle is now poised to see shares trading at strikingly higher prices beginning in the near future.\n\nDennis Calvert, BioLargo\u2019s CEO says, *\u201cIf you want the prize, you have to do the hard work. BioLargo is a company that has done the hard work and is about to get the prize.\u201d*",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, February 19, 2021**\n\nAfter opening the day higher, stocks pulled back throughout the session to finish in the red, closing out a very volatile week in the stock market. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 0.17% down, the tech-heavy Nasdaq closed 0.44% down, and the Dow (DIA) closed 0.03% down. Even though the major indexes pulled back this week, they continue to hover near record levels as optimism over additional stimulus continues to fuel higher levels of risk tolerance among market participants. \n\nThere are many encouraging developments surrounding the coronavirus. This week, the United States averaged 77,665 new coronavirus cases per day, a drop of 43% from the average of two weeks ago, according to data analyzed by the New York Times. Furthermore, [analysis from Bloomberg on Thursday ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-18/how-many-vaccine-doses-are-available-u-s-should-see-a-surge?srnd=premium)showed that the U.S. vaccine supply is poised to double from the current rate of 10 million to 15 million doses per week within the next few weeks, allowing more shots to be given in the near-term.\n\nThursday night, in an interview with CNBC, Treasury Secretary Yellen said a large stimulus package is still necessary to build up sufficient momentum for economic recovery to take off on its own. She said, \u201cWe think it\u2019s very important to have a big package \\[that\\] addresses the pain this has caused \u2013 15 million Americans behind on their rent, 24 million adults and 12 million children who don\u2019t have enough to eat, small businesses failing. I think the price of doing too little is much higher than the price of doing something big. We think that the benefits will far outweigh the costs in the longer run,\u201d she added.\u201d \n\nDespite a record low supply and a temporary pullback in December, the housing market remains very strong. According to a report by the National Association of Realtors, sales ended the month of January at a seasonally adjusted, annualized rate of 6.69 million units. That figure is 0.6 higher than December and 23.7% higher when compared with January 2020 and the second-highest sales pace since April 2006.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison vowed on Friday to press ahead with laws to force Facebook (FB) to pay news outlets for content, saying he had received support from world leaders after the social media giant blacked out all news media in the country. The US State Department said it sees the dispute as a business matter between a company and a country and is unlikely to get involved.\n* A SPAC called Forest Road Acquisition Corp recently announced a merger with Beachbody and Myx Fitness. The company\u2019s first SPAC raised $300 million and included one third of a warrant with units. Shaquille O\u2019Neal is a strategic advisor for this merger. \n* Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) impressive rally vaulted the cryptocurrency to a market cap larger than $1 trillion for the first time and well above $50,000 per coin\n* Analog Devices (ADI) target raised by Argus from $155 to $180 at Buy. Stock currently around $158\n* Applied Materials (AMAT) with a host of target raises. Consensus price target is $140 at Overweight. Stock currently around $113\n* Arista Networks (ANET) with a host of target raises. Consensus price target around $350 at Outperform. Stock currently around $308\n* Baidu (BIDU) target raised by UBS Group from $315 to $400 at Buy. Stock currently around $298\n* Crocs (CROX) target raised by Pivotal Research from $87 to $92 at Buy. Stock currently around $80\n* Intuit (INTU) target raised by Barclays from \n* 4455 to $480 at Overweight. Stock currently around $415\n* Sunnova Energy (NOVA) target raised by B. Riley from $55 to $60 at Buy. Stock currently around $47\n* Palo Alto Networks (PANW) target raised by Morgan Stanley (MS) from $425 to $515. Stock currently around $390\n* After positive earnings report, (ROKU) with a host of target raises. Conensus price target $575 at Buy. Stock currently around $450\n* The Trade Desk (TTD) with two target raises. Stock currently around $846\n   * Pivotal Research from $950 to $1010 Buy\n   * Oppenheimer from $900 to $950 at Outperform\n* WorkDay (WDAY) target raised by Evercore ISI from $290 to $320 at Outperform. Stock currently around $272\n\n\u201cAn investment in knowledge pays the best interest. \u201c Benjamin Franklin",

These investment principles do not constitute investment advice, but rather are general principles one might employ in reaching his or her overall financial goals. *All* investing bears risk, including possible loss of capital.\n\n**#1 Create a healthy balance in your portfolio between risky and less risky investments**\n\n\u201cFurthermore, a truly conservative investor will be satisfied with the gains shown on half his portfolio in a rising market, while in a severe decline he may derive much solace from reflecting how much better off he is than many of his more venturesome friends.\u201d \u2013 quote from Benjamin Graham\n\nA conservative investor may have 50% of his or her portfolio in risky assets like stocks and real estate and 50% in less risky investments like US treasury bonds (which you can buy either directly from the US Treasury or through ETFs like Charles Schwab Short Term Treasuries ETF (Ticker: SCHO) as well as through investments in gold (SPDR Gold Trust (Ticker: GLD)) which tends to be a good portfolio hedge against volatile markets and inflation (at least historically).\n\nBenjamin Graham\u2019s formula for calculating the percentage of assets that should be in risky vs. less-risky investments is to subtract your age from 100 and invest that percentage of your assets in risky investments (like stocks), with the rest in relatively safer assets like cash and gold. For instance, if you are 35 years old, you might invest 65% of your investible assets (not including savings) into risky assets like stocks and 35% of your investible assets in less volatile assets like cash (USD/euro or another stable currency) and gold. A 70-year-old, on the other hand, would only invest 30% (rather than 65%) of his or her assets in risky investments (like stocks) and the balance in more stable assets like cash (again, assuming the cash is in US dollar, euros or another relatively stable \u201clow\u201d inflation currency.)\n\nBenjamin Graham formula for proper investment portfolio balance:\n\n100 \u2013 your age = risky assets (such as stocks), with the balance in less risky assets\n\nOf note, most of us might categorize real estate investments as safe investments (which may be the case relative to stocks). That said, as Benjamin Graham reminded us over half a century before the 2007-2008 Great Recession, \u201cUnfortunately, real-estate values are also subject to wide fluctuations; serious errors can be made in location, price paid, etc.\u201d With most financial assets highly correlated these days due to the high interconnectivity of markets and economies, there are few truly uncorrelated and riskless assets. Real estate prices are as high as ever in 2021 thanks to over a decade of easy monetary policy, along with a dwindling inventory of available homes for sale in the US.\n\n**#2 Have an emergency fund**\n\n\u201cThe unexpected can strike anyone, at any age. Everyone must keep some assets in the riskless haven of cash.\u201d Quote from Benjamin Graham\n\nWe never know when emergencies may strike. We might be fired. Our division at work might be cut. Our spouse or child may experience a significant setback. The 2020 Year from Hell and Covid-19 should remind the world and each of us that disaster can strike at a moment\u2019s notice. We must be prepared for these uncertainties. While volunteering at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), a patient once inadvertently taught the author of this piece, Henry Gindt, to \u201calways expect the unexpected.\u201d This particular patient happened to be in the hospital following a heart attack\u2026in his mid-40s\u2026as a marathon runner. (As a side-note, some of the best life lessons and principles can be learned through volunteering. If 2020 taught us anything, it might be that there are plenty of our fellow men and women out there who could use a helping hand. Find a great volunteer opportunity near me.) \u201cEmergencies\u201d happen all the time in life. Oftentimes these emergencies spill over into the financial side of the house. Vanguard Investments suggests as a rule of thumb to maintain at least 3-6 months of income in such an emergency fund in order to cover things like food, mortgage payments/rent, credit card bills, and ongoing health insurance or COBRA in the event of a lost job. This emergency fund should not be invested except in low-risk securities like US Treasuries.\n\n**#3 Choose ETFs over individual stocks**\n\n\u201cThere are two ways to be an intelligent investor: by continually researching, selecting, and monitoring a dynamic mix of stocks, bonds, or mutual funds; or by creating a permanent portfolio that runs on autopilot and requires no further effort (but generates very little excitement).\u201d Quote from Benjamin Graham\n\nBroad market ETFs can curb our emotional impulses to buy and sell to some degree as these broad market index funds are less volatile than most any single individual security. The framework around how we might build an optimal portfolio might be to create balance in your portfolio by 1) conducting ongoing and rigorous homework analyzing stocks (\u201cactive investor\u201d) or by selecting a few ETFs and dollar-cost-averaging your investments into these funds over time (see points below). In the Intelligent Investor\u2019s prologue, Warren Buffett reminds us that \u201cWhat\u2019s needed is a sound intellectual framework for making decisions and the ability to keep emotions from corroding that framework.\u201d\n\nStep 1 might be to determine a fixed split between risky and less risky assets as part of your investment portfolio (perhaps using Graham\u2019s formula above based on your age).\n\nStep 2 might then be to select a few US and world market ETFs.\n\nThis approach might be thought of as setting your portfolio on autopilot as Graham suggests. Some example ETFs offering broad market exposure to US markets include ETFs under the tickers SPY (S&amp;P 500), QQQ (Nasdaq) and DIA (Dow Jones). You can also gain exposure to global markets and global economic growth through even broader market ETFs and mutual funds from Vanguard (ticker VTI), Charles Schwab (ticker SWTSX), and Fidelity (ticker FZROX). These ETFs can be purchased through whichever financial app you use: You Invest (JPMorgan), Fidelity, E\\*TRADE, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, Ally Invest, or any other.\n\nThis simple framework may likely do the trick in meeting your financial goals (as well as outperforming any active portfolio management you might pursue). See also how the KISS principle might relate to other areas of your life.\n\n**#4 If you insist on owning individual stocks (active investor) vs. ETFs (passive investor), create a well-balanced and diversified portfolio**\n\n\u201cGraham\u2019s guideline of owning between 10 and 30 stocks remains a good starting point for investors who want to pick their own stocks, but you must make sure that you are not overexposed to one industry.\u201d Quote from Jason Zweig\n\nIf you insist on picking your own stocks vs. using a basket of stocks through ETFs, try to have between 10-30 stocks to get the benefit of good diversification and do not choose all of these stocks from the same industry. A well-balanced portfolio means selecting at least 10 stocks from at least 3 or 4 different industries, according to Graham. For instance, you might balance some investments in high-growth technology sectors with conservative non-cyclical companies that likely pay dividends and have stable growth such as the best healthcare and insurance companies (what some think of as \u201cboring\u201d companies). Experts disagree on how many stocks you must own to have a well-diversified portfolio, but the benefits of diversification tend to experience diminishing marginal benefit as you go over 30 stocks. Additionally, your life becomes increasingly complicated if you are actively managing 30+ stocks. Hedge fund professionals spend 100% of their work time focused on tracking their investments. Do you have time to dedicate 40-60 hours+/ week on researching and monitoring your portfolio? If so, and for advanced investors, including hedge fund traders, you might read Benjamin Graham\u2019s textbook Security Analysis. It is quite amazing how few professional investors on Wall Street and elsewhere have ever read Security Analysis. Graham reminds us that:\n\nThere is a close logical connection between the concept of a safety margin and the principle of diversification. One is correlative with the other. Even with a margin in the investor\u2019s favor, an individual security may work out badly. For the margin guarantees only that he has a better chance for profit than for loss\u2014not that loss is impossible. But as the number of such commitments is increased the more certain does it become that the aggregate of the profits will exceed the aggregate of the losses. That is the simple basis of the insurance-underwriting business.\n\n**#5 Don\u2019t overpay for stocks (or real-estate investments, cryptocurrency or any other investment)**\n\n\u201cThe investor should impose some limit on the price he will pay for an issue in relation to its average earnings over, say, the past seven years. We suggest that this limit be set at 25 times such average earnings, and not more than 20 times those of the last twelve-month period.\u201d Quote from Benjamin Graham\n\nDon\u2019t overpay for stocks just because momentum is good for the moment. In fact, Graham suggested paying an average P/E multiple of 12-13 across an intelligent investor\u2019s portfolio with a maximum P/E of 15 for any individual security. While these P/E ratios are likely overly conservative and represent outdated valuation rules of thumb in the era of pre-rapid technology innovation/adoption and hyper-globalization, one shouldn\u2019t simply ignore a company\u2019s current and future earnings prospects in assigning a value. Benjamin Graham reminds us that \u201cthe time everyone decides that a given industry is \u2018obviously\u2019 the best one to invest in, the prices of its stocks \\[or other assets\\] have been bid up so high that its future returns have nowhere to go but down.\u201d (See points below on analyzing company fundamentals including both value and growth). If you are investing in some of the latest technology stocks or household name companies like Tesla, Uber, AirBNB, Poshmark, etc., you might notice that the P/E multiple is either non-existent or extremely high. This is because the company is not yet earning much (or any) profit. Instead, the market is valuing the company based on its growth profile which, over time, assuming all goes according to plan, will turn into healthy earnings and profit. However, the second the growth assumptions are tweaked by equity research analysts on Wall St. (or a string of bad news hits the company, its industry or the market overall), the initial rosy valuation assumptions of these high-growth/loss-making companies will swiftly be revised downwards, leading to an almost immediate or rapid decline in value. The collapse in value of your securities and investments will be at least twice as painful as the pleasure from the ride up, according to world-renown psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. Importantly, never forget that the rosy growth assumptions under which are investing today may experience a sharp reversal when you have ceased actively monitoring these investments months or years later. Even if you choose to become an active investor (rather than a passive investor primarily invested in ETFs), by the time the bad news hits, the damage will already be done due to the rapid price movements following breaking news.\n\nGraham and many other notable investors like Warren Buffett and Seth Klarman, billionaire and founder of the investment firm Baupost Group, often speak of creating \u201cmargin of safety\u201d when making investments by buying significantly below a company\u2019s intrinsic value. This built-in \u201cpricing buffer\u201d creates some wiggle room and margin for when things don\u2019t work out as planned, as they inevitably do in both financial markets and life more generally. Graham tells us that \u201cIf the purchases are made at the average level of the market over a span of years, the prices paid should carry with them assurance of an adequate margin of safety. The danger to investors lies in concentrating their purchases in the upper levels of the market, or in buying nonrepresentative common stocks that carry more than average risk of diminished earning power.\u201d In other words, Graham himself speaks to the value of dollar-cost-averaging, where the intelligent investor is consistently buying over time, during good times, as well as during bad times.\n\nThe Acorns investment app is an interesting app that can help smooth the average \u201cbuy-in price\u201d to avoid concentrating investments when markets are hot and selling when markets are depressed by trickling in investments consistently every day/week/month without any active engagement\u2026over decades. This \u201cdollar-cost-averaging\u201d approach is likely a much better approach for most all of us in the long run, particularly those of us with a few decades to go until retirement. Consider using investment apps like Acorns or talk to your investment advisor about dollar-cost averaging your investments each week or month. **If you'd like to help the OP develop a competitor to Acorns, I'm all in.**\n\n**#6 Focus on the \u201cfundamentals\u201d (earnings and growth) assuming you choose to be an active investor as opposed to a passive investor**\n\n\u201cExperience has shown that in most cases safety resides in the earning power, and if this is deficient the assets lose most of their reputed value.\u201d Benjamin Graham\n\nCompanies like Amazon, Google and Apple are now worth over $1 trillion each as their earnings power is so solid and market dominance so secure (for now). In the case of Google, for example, the company prints billions of dollars annually from Google Ads alone. When selecting individual stocks, focus on the earnings power and repeatability of those earnings in a normal year (\u201cnormalized earnings\u201d). Also, pay close attention to the company\u2019s growth prospects. Growth is a much more important factor in the 2020s due to the current pace of globalization compared with Benjamin Graham\u2019s era where markets weren\u2019t as interconnected and the United States market offered nearly all the great investment opportunities in his day.\n\nGraham\u2019s formula for selecting growth-oriented companies (as opposed to value-oriented companies below) is Value = Current (Normal) Earnings \u00d7 (8.5 plus twice the expected annual growth rate), where the annual growth rate can reasonably be expected from the company for at least 7 to 10 years. This formula might be revised to reflect current growth and technology assumptions. However, having some sort of investment formula (which perhaps you develop) as a guide might come in handy as much today as it did in 1949. If you can hold yourself to this investment formula, you might avoid serious mistakes. You might also stress test each of your stock investment ideas (or investment formula) with 2-3 trusted advisers to gain an \u201coutside view.\u201d\n\nFor more value-oriented investments, Graham lists 7 key requirements:\n\n1. Adequate size\n2. Sufficiently strong financial condition\n3. Continued dividends for at least the past 20 years\n4. No earnings deficit in the past ten years\n5. Ten-year growth of at least one-third in per-share earnings\n6. Price of stock no more than 1\u00bd times net asset value\n7. Price no more than 15 times average earnings of the past three years.\n8. In developing your own formula for investing in today\u2019s markets, you might take some example key requirements above and revise them to fit your investment strategy.\n\n**#7 Have patience. (This is hard. Very hard. Extremely hard.)**\n\n\u201cA defensive investor runs\u2014and wins\u2014the race by sitting still. Patience is the fund investor\u2019s single most powerful ally.\u201d Quote from Benjamin Graham.\n\nWhen markets are panicking and you don\u2019t know what to do, do nothing. Panicking only makes matters worse as you try to sell or make other rash decisions. The Intelligent Investor is patient and knows that the best investment holding period is forever, followed by a lifetime, followed by 30 years, followed by 10 years, followed by 3-5 years, followed by at least 1 year in order to reap the capital gains tax benefits (see point below on optimizing taxes). Benjamin Graham reminds us that \u201cIn the financial markets, the worse the future looks, the better it usually turns out to be.\u201d\n\n**#8 Set rules for when to sell**\n\n\u201cReversals \\[of fortune\\] will have more meaning for the active than for the passive investor. But they suggest that even defensive portfolios should be changed from time to time, especially if the securities purchased have an apparently excessive advance and can be replaced by issues much more reasonably priced.\u201d Quote from Benjamin Graham\n\nIt may be assumed that a stern and uniform policy of selling at 25% or 30% profit will work out best as applied to many holdings.\u201d Quotes from Benjamin Graham\n\nSet rules for when to sell such as after a certain time period has elapsed (say 2-5 years) or profit goal or loss limit has been reached. Instituting rules such as selling all securities at a 30%/50%/100%/3x etc. profit (or at a 10%/30% loss to cap losses) can take some of the emotion out of investing. Make sure whatever specific goal you set when making the investment in a stock(s) or other security aligns with your long-term financial goals. Setting rules on the front-end that align well with your overall long-term financial goals should include setting rules for both downside scenarios and upside scenarios. The best financial and investment apps are pretty good about making it easy to set \u201cstop losses\u201d or sell at a predetermined profit level. We might also be reminded by Benjamin Graham\u2019s most famous student, Warren Buffett, about the two key rules of avoiding loss of principal so that you can stay in the game: #1 Don\u2019t lose money and #2 See rule #1.\n\nSome of the best online trading apps and investment apps include Fidelity, E\\*TRADE, TD Ameritrade, You Invest (JPMorgan), Charles Schwab and Ally Invest. If you don\u2019t have time to do the arduous and consistent research required on the 10-30 stocks in your balanced investment portfolio, a better approach is to use the Acorns app which automates your investments into the most well-known and diversified ETFs from Vanguard. **If you'd like to help the OP develop a competitor to Acorns, I'm all in.**\n\n**#9 Don\u2019t chase the latest shining star**\n\n\u201cWhat you don\u2019t do is as important to your success as what you do. The lesson is clear: Don\u2019t just do something, stand there. It\u2019s time for everyone to acknowledge that the term \u2018long-term investor\u2019 is redundant. A long-term investor is the only kind of investor there is. Someone who can\u2019t hold on to stocks for more than a few months at a time is doomed to end up not as a victor but as a victim.\u201d Quote from Benjamin Graham\n\nDon\u2019t jump on the latest stock or other \u201chot\u201d investment bandwagon. If the stock is front-page news all over the world and is skyrocketing, it is 9 times out of 10 too late to get onboard for profit. Momentum plays a big role in stock prices in the short term, but over the long run, a company is valued on its earnings and growth trajectory. Oftentimes, technology companies receive such a lofty valuation based on future growth expectations, such as Tesla\u2019s historic rise in 2020. If growth does not end up meeting these expectations, you can expect a company\u2019s publicly traded valuation to decline as quickly as it rose. See cryptocurrency analysis here: [https://gocheezy.com/crypto-bonanza/](https://gocheezy.com/crypto-bonanza/)\n\n**#10 Ignore \u201cthe charts\u201d**\n\n\u201cIf you look at a large quantity of data long enough, a huge number of patterns will emerge\u2014if only by chance.\u201d Quote from Benjamin Graham\n\nThe only metrics you should be focused on are the fundamentals of the company (earning and growth). Many investors these days are fixated on \u201cthe charts\u201d such as various moving averages. These are all non-sense. These charts are simply reflections of the latest emotion of an entire market consisting of billions of people reacting to the latest positive or negative news. Ignore these human emotions masquerading as indicators and charts. They will not serve you well in the end. Benjamin Graham refers frequently to the stock market as the emotional and moody \u201cMr. Market,\u201d which is subject to the daily whims and emotions of\u2026the people trading the stocks on the market. Are there market dislocations and can some investors make money by spotting those temporary market anomalies and market dislocations? Sure. Can they do so repeatedly and consistently over time such that they beat the overall stock market? Many experts think not. In fact, Barrons\u2019 research showed that hedge funds only beat the market by an average of 1.5% annually over the past 20 years. After subtracting the 2% annual fees these investment managers charge the pensions and endowments which are their own investors, they lose money. Think you can beat the average hedge fund manager? Statistically, it\u2019s possible. For a while. Until you don\u2019t. See later points on automating portions (or a substantial amount) of your investments. As humans, we all like crunching data and seeking out patterns. It\u2019s usually not wise in the realm of public markets investing.\n\n**#11 Look for large undervalued companies**\n\nThe market is fond of making mountains out of molehills. If we assume that it is the habit of the market to overvalue common stocks which have been showing excellent growth or are glamorous for some other reason, it is logical to expect that it will undervalue\u2014relatively, at least\u2014companies that are out of favor because of unsatisfactory developments of a temporary nature. Quote from Benjamin Graham.\n\nHunt for true bargains. Graham defines a true bargain as a company that is currently trading at a 50% or more discount from its inherent/intrinsic value. For instance, Facebook was a good example of an interesting investment opportunity for growth at a reasonable price (GARP) during the major market crash in 2020 and when the company made global headlines for it\u2019s privacy issues. See the referenced two major dips on Google Finance here. The global food giant Wal-Mart provides another good example of a value-oriented investment with a healthy long-term dividend. Wal-Mart was trading in the low $80s/ share in 2018 when Amazon was soaring. Check Wal-Mart today. As conventional wisdom goes, markets tend to overcorrect during negative news cycles and overbuy/overpay when the sky is blue, the sun is out and wind behind the sails is plentiful.\n\n**#12 Expect market volatility (and have nerves of steel during this time)**\n\n\u201cIn any case the investor may as well resign himself in advance to the probability rather than the mere possibility that most of his holdings will advance, say, 50% or more from their low point and decline the equivalent one-third or more from their high point at various periods in the next five years.\n\nIn the end, how your investments behave is much less important than how you behave.\u201d Quotes from Benjamin Graham\n\nManage your emotions. If you can\u2019t (like most all of us), read the following two points on micromanaging investments and market volatility. Re-read them. Then, re-read them again. Jason Zweig points to the work of world-renown psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, whose studies have shown that we experience negative emotions and pain from loss twice as intensely as we experience joy and pleasure from gain. This \u201closs aversion\u201d principle applies not only to financial markets but to many aspects of life. You might check out Daniel Kahneman\u2019s bestseller Thinking Fast and Slow to dig deeper into these psychological forces that influence how we react and behave every day. Markets will inevitably decline, sometimes by as much as 50% or more. Remain focused on the long-run by having nerves of steel. Remember the 2007-2008 Great Recession and the 2020 Covid-19 Global Pandemic and analyze those stock market dips in the context of current market prices. Graham reminds us that:\n\nFor indeed, the investor\u2019s chief problem\u2014and even his worst enemy\u2014is likely to be himself. (\u201cThe fault, dear \\[investor/Brutus\\], is not in our stars\u2014\\[and not in our stocks\\]\u2014but in ourselves\u2026.\u201d \u2013 William Shakespeare). We have seen much more money made and kept by \u201cordinary people\u201d who were temperamentally well suited for the investment process than by those who lacked this quality, even though they had an extensive knowledge of finance, accounting, and stock-market lore.\n\n**#13 Do not micromanage your investments**\n\n\u201cIt is for these reasons of human nature, even more than by calculation of financial gain or loss, that we favor some kind of mechanical method for varying the proportion of bonds (less risky) to stocks (more risky) in the investor\u2019s portfolio.\u201d- Quote from Benjamin Graham.\n\nAvoiding micromanaging of investments ties into the point above on keeping emotions in check. You might focus on rebalancing your portfolio between risky and less risky assets 1-2 times/ year rather than choosing new stocks endlessly throughout the year. Graham proposes a rule of thumb for maintaining a split in your portfolio of 100 \u2013 your age in risky assets (like stocks) and the balance in less risky assets like treasuries, cash and gold. Spending your time balancing and rebalancing your investment portfolio 1-2 times a year, for instance, is likely far better than readjusting your portfolio daily or weekly, which is a common investment mistake made by the best of us and is largely based on human emotion and current market news and headlines rather than based on sound financial analysis.\n\nDon\u2019t overreact to the headlines. Everyone sees the headline and sells or buys depending on whether the headline was positive or negative. Challenge yourself to take a strong mental note (or better yet keep a log of your notes) and consider the particular headline in light of all the other news and headlines the next time you rebalance your portfolio (at most 1-2x/ year). Ben Graham reminds us that \u201cmost businesses change in character and quality over the years, sometimes for the better, perhaps more often for the worse. The investor need not watch his companies\u2019 performance like a hawk; but he should give it a good, hard look from time to time. Basically, price fluctuations have only one significant meaning for the true investor. They provide him with an opportunity to buy wisely when prices fall sharply and to sell wisely when they advance a great deal.\u201d In other words, you might take a contrarian approach when looking for interesting market dislocations.\n\n**#14 Automate. Automate. Automate.**\n\n\u201cIt is for these reasons of human nature, even more than by calculation of financial gain or loss, that we favor some kind of mechanical method for varying the proportion of bonds to stocks in the investor\u2019s portfolio.\u201d Quote from Benjamin Graham\n\n\u201cIf your investment horizon is long\u2014at least 25 or 30 years\u2014there is only one sensible approach: Buy every month, automatically, and whenever else you can spare some money.\u201d Quote from Jason Zweig.\n\nChoose a financial investment app like Acorns to mechanize and automate the process of investing. If you are starting out investing in your 20s or 30s, you will have plenty of decades for the markets to work for you. You might trickle in however much you can afford in order to make these investments consistently. The beauty of Acorns is you can set up a recurring investment (of say $100 per week) without having to actively remember to invest daily/weekly/monthly. A unique feature of Acorns is that you can link your credit cards so that for every purchase you make, the \u201cpurchase amount\u201d is rounded up to the next dollar and instantaneously invested in a broad set of index funds. Further, you can decide whether the funds are invested in broad index funds falling into a conservative, moderate, or aggressive approach, depending on your age and financial goals. Benjamin Graham explains the concept of \u201cdollar-cost-averaging\u201d (the approach used by the financial investment app Acorns), in the following way **(If you'd like to help the OP develop a competitor to Acorns, I'm all in):**\n\n\u201cThe third is the device of \u201cdollar-cost averaging,\u201d which means simply that the practitioner invests in common stocks the same number of dollars each month or each quarter. In this way he buys more shares when the market is low than when it is high, and he is likely to end up with a satisfactory overall price for all his holdings.\u201d\n\nYou might also consider using a personal financial app like Mint from Intuit or Plaid to manage your overall financial goals, which offer tools and features like a personal budget planner, credit monitoring, and \u201ctrack my spending.\u201d\n\n**#15 Never forget the reason for investing in the first place**\n\n\u201cAfter all, the whole point of investing is not to earn more money than average, but to earn enough money to meet your own needs.\u201d Quote from Jason Zweig.\n\nMany investors focus on either getting rich or making more money than their peers or simply beating the stock market averages. These investors tend to lose sight of the overall purpose of investing. Focus on your unique goals for investing as it relates to your unique financial situation. Are you trying to meet your and your family\u2019s financial needs for this month or this year? Are you on the verge of retirement? Are you in the prime of your career? Each person\u2019s financial situation is unique because the timing of our financial needs depends on our situation. However, all of us might benefit from reminding ourselves why we invest in the first place. Separate from investing, it\u2019s also worth considering how much of our time we\u2019re willing to trade in order to earn money, oftentimes to buy things we don\u2019t need to impress people we don\u2019t care about impressing in the first place. Time is the most valuable asset for anyone. Invest as much as you can in yourself through ongoing education, learning, and spending time with friends and family. In terms of your financial goals, specifically, see the point above on finding and using one of the best personal finance apps like Mint or Plaid.\n\n**#16 Understand the definition of the phrase \u201clong-term\u201d investments (as well as long-term financial goals)**\n\n\u201cPsychologists have shown that humans have an inborn tendency to believe that the long run can be predicted from even a short series of outcomes.\u201d Quote from Benjamin Graham\n\nTry to think about the \u201clong-run\u201d in blocks of 10/20/30/50 years from now, depending on your age. The two most glaring examples of \u201cshort-term\u201d market disruptions in the context of true \u201clong-term\u201d investments or \u201clong-term\u201d personal or financial goals might be the 2007-2008 Great Recession or the 2020 Covid-19 Global Pandemic (see also WHO). While both crises were undoubtedly severe during the time, markets typically recover within a decade or less. Why is this? If you consider that \u201cthe stock market\u201d is simply a marketplace for buying and selling ownership interests in companies and that you can own a small sliver of the US or world economy through broad market ETFs, it might not be surprising that over time there will be growth. The aggregate of companies nearly always grows over time because the global population of people is growing and collectively building and creating new cities, companies, patents, inventions, ideas, etc. Companies routinely collapse and fall out of the various stock market indices while other companies soar. Some recent examples include Tesla being incorporated into the S&amp;P 500 in 2020 on the one hand while GE was delisted from the S&amp;P 500 in 2018 as the last of the original members of the exchange and replaced by Walgreens on the other hand. Walgreens itself may ultimately fall (or be diminished) due to competition from Amazon, which is rolling out a healthcare platform of its own with online pharmacy delivery following the acquisition of PillPack.) You might track how some of the best consumer startups from 2021 or social media 3.0 startups are doing in the year 2030. Some of these companies may appear on the Nasdaq and be household names. Others might be totally forgotten. These concrete examples of market forces represent the most authoritative definition of American capitalism or American innovation. One of Henry Gindt\u2019s colleagues characterized the United States as the largest business incubator the world has ever known.\n\nYou can gain exposure to this collective economic growth in the United States through broad market ETFs like SPY (S&amp;P 500), QQQ (Nasdaq) or DIA (Dow Jones). You can also gain exposure to global economic growth through even broader market ETFs and mutual funds from Vanguard (ticker VTI), Charles Schwab (ticker SWTSX), and Fidelity (ticker FZROX) which all track the collective global stock market and have close to zero fees. Benjamin Graham tells us that \u201cthe intelligent investor has no interest in being temporarily right.\u201d\n\n**#17 Tax optimize by holding investments for at least one year to reap benefits of the lower capital gains tax rate**\n\nOur new Constitution is now established, and has an appearance that promises permanency; but in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes. \u2013 Quote from Benjamin Franklin in 1789\n\nThe long-term capital gains tax rate for 2020-2021 is 15% for most single tax filers, but is 0% if annual income is below $80,000 and 20% if annual income is over $441,450. See the IRS page on capital gains for more detail. Aside from incurring high transaction costs from daily (or otherwise frequent) stock trading, when you sell an investment prior to holding that investment for at least one year, your profit will be subject to your typical income tax rate rather than the lower capital gains tax rates above.\n\n**Disclaimer:** The views above represent the opinions of the OP and are supported by research from Benjamin Graham's Security Analysis from 1934 and The Intelligent Investor from 1949, along with Google and Yahoo Finance and public statements from Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, February 24, 2021**\n\nStocks rose on Wednesday, with each of the three major indices closing the day positive. Shares of technology companies, which were hit the hardest by the pullback, shook earlier losses, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) closing 0.82% higher. \n\nIn the past week, the rotation from high-flying growth stocks into cyclical and value investments picked up steam as fears of higher Treasury yields pressured stocks across the board this week, with higher prices and increased borrowing costs for companies seen as an emerging threat for high valuation companies. \n\nDuring his semiannual testimony on monetary policy, Chair of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell said that rising Treasury yields are, \u201ca statement of confidence on the part of markets that we\u2019ll have a robust and ultimately complete recovery\u201d. As a reminder, Treasury yields are the total amount of money you earn by owning U.S. Treasury bills, notes, bonds or inflation-protected securities. The U.S. Department of the Treasury sells them to pay for the US debt and when the timeframe of the note expires, the government pays back the face value plus states interest. Essentially, Powell is saying that Treasury yields are going up because investors believe in the US\u2019 ability to pay back the interest of those yields when the time expires, which implies the economy will recover.\n\nIn his remarks, Powell reaffirmed that the Federal Reserve was looking to maintain its current accommodative policy posturing for the time being, keeping benchmark rates near zero and asset purchases at the current pace of $120 billion per month. He said, \"The economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved. We will continue to clearly communicate our assessment of progress toward our goals well in advance of any change in the pace of purchases.\" Supportive monetary policy from the Federal Reserve is one of the reasons we think the factors are in place for a sustained bull market even after the pandemic is over. While there are certainly short-term headwinds in the market, our long-term outlook remains bullish.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Incredible, in the last few hours of the market, \u201cmeme stocks\u201d like AMC and Gamestop (GME) gapped up strongly. Including after-hours movement, GME is up more than 120% on the day at the time of writing. This really is Psycho!!\n* President Joe Biden will sign an executive order on Wednesday aimed at addressing a global semiconductor chip shortage that has forced U.S. automakers and other manufacturers to cut production. The order will launch a 100-day review of supply chains for four critical products: semiconductor chips, large-capacity batteries for electric vehicles, rare earth minerals, and pharmaceuticals.\n* After the recent pullback in Tesla (TSLA), Cathie Woods, portfolio manager at ARK Investments, upped the bet on Tesla by $121 million in her ETF ARKK, the top-performing ETF of last year. We\u2019re huge fans of Cathie Woods here at PsychoTrader, we pay attention when she does something. We think you should as well. \n* U.S. new home sales jumped by 4.3% in January over December, the [Commerce Department reported Wednesday ](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf)morning, far exceeding expectations as a jump in housing market activity last year extended into the beginning of the new year. We have been banging the table on mortgage REITs for a while now, still way below pre-pandemic levels and a great long-term opportunity in our view.\n* The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said Johnson &amp; Johnson's (JNJ) single-shot COVID-19 vaccine appeared safe and effective in trials, paving the road for the third vaccine to receive emergency use authorization in the US.\n* Despite a recent video showing one of their engines catching on fire, shares of Boeing (BA) gapped up today.\n* Dell Tech (DELL) target raised by JP Morgan (JPM) from $85 to $90 at Overweight. Stock currently around $80\n* Intuit (INTU) with two target raises. Stock currently around $400\n   * Wells Fargo (WFC) from $440 to $450\n   * Stifel Nicolaus from $400 to $425\n* Jazz Pharma (JAZZ) with two target raises. Stock currently around $157\n   * Piper Sandler from $175 to $205 at Overweight\n   * Jefferies from $209 to $214 at Buy\n* After securing USPS contract, Oshkosh (OSK) target raised by Keycorp from $104 to $125 at Overweight. Stock currently around $109. Shares of Workhorse (WKHS) another company that was vying for the same contract, plummeted on the news.\n* Nordson (NDSN) target raised by Wells Fargo (WFC) from $220 to $230 at Overweight. Stock currently around $188\n* Palo Alto Networks (PANW) target raised by Argus from $10 to $440 at Buy. Stock currently around $378\n* Snapchat (SNAP) with a host of positive target raises. Consensus price target is $85 at Buy. Stock currently around $70.50\n\n\u201cBe fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful\u201d - Warren Buffet (This is so true guys, think of yesterday)",

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Wednesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Wednesday, February 24th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/24/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-24-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Stocks set to rise after Tuesday\u2019s turnaround on Wall Street\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures rose on Wednesday, a day after Wall Street\u2019s wild ride that saw the Nasdaq claw back nearly all of a nearly 4% loss to close down just 0.5%. The S&amp;P 500 reversed a 1.8% decline to close up slightly, breaking a five-session losing streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average wiped about a drop of 360 points, or more than 1%, to close modestly higher for the third straight session.\n\n&gt; * Tuesday\u2019s turnaround, especially in tech stocks, came after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told the Senate Banking Committee that inflation is still \u201csoft\u201d and the economic outlook is still \u201chighly uncertain\u201d due to the pandemic. That eased fears of a central bank policy change. Powell appears before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday in the second and final part of his mandated semiannual economic testimony to Congress.\n\n&gt; * The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s staff endorsed Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use, a critical step in bringing a third shot to the U.S. marketplace. The staff report is meant to brief the FDA\u2019s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, which will meet Friday to review J&amp;J\u2019s request for emergency use authorization.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. Tesla bounces and a fund manager with a hot-hand may be the reason\n\n&gt; * Tesla rose more than 4% in premarket trading after staging a major comeback Tuesday. At one point, as b/itcoin prices sank, shares plunged 13%. By the close, it recouped most of those losses to finish down only nearly 2.2%. However, Tesla\u2019s four-session slide did total more than 11%, dragging the high-flying stock into the red by nearly 1% for 2021. Over the past 12 months, it was still up a whopping 287%.\n\n&gt; * Ark Invest\u2019s Cathie Wood, who\u2019s had a hot hand recently, scooped up more than $120 million worth of Tesla shares during Tuesday\u2019s rout and subsequent comeback. Wood\u2019s buying may have helped spark the Tuesday turnaround in Tesla. CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer tweeted that \u201cCathie puts the bottom in Tesla!\u201d\n\n&gt; * Wood told Bloomberg Radio on Tuesday she\u2019s particularly bullish on Tesla\u2019s ride-hailing service as a bridge to autonomous driving. \u201cWe do not think many analysts are giving Tesla credit for autonomous. If they were, the stock would be a lot higher,\u201d he added.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. B/itcoin rebounds, surging back above $50,000\n\n&gt; * Wood, also a b/itcoin bull, told Bloomberg, \u201d\u201cWe\u2019re very positive on B/itcoin, very happy to see a healthy correction here, no market is straight up.\u201d B/itcoin climbed back above the $50,000 on Wednesday, after a brutal sell-off earlier this week. B/itcoin is up more than 70% year-to-date and over 400% in the last 12 months.\n\n&gt; * Square said Tuesday it bought $170 million worth b/itcoin. The fintech firm, run by Jack Dorsey who\u2019s also CEO of Twitter, bought $50 million worth of the world\u2019s biggest c/ryptocurrency last year. Dorsey, one of b/itcoin\u2019s most well-known proponents, once predicted it would eventually become the \u201csingle currency\u201d of the internet.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. GameStop CFO to step down after Reddit-driven stock rally\n\n&gt; * GameStop CFO Jim Bell will step down next month. The video game retailer said Bell\u2019s resignation was not due to any disagreement with the company relating to its operations, including accounting principles and practices. However, a source told Reuters that Bell\u2019s exit was unrelated to the recent Reddit-fueled wild swings in GameStop\u2019s stock. However, the source said his departure was initiated by GameStop, in a sign he was not viewed as the right fit as the retailer transitions into a tech-oriented business.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. Lowe\u2019s tops earnings estimates as same-store sales jump\n\n&gt; * Lowe\u2019s shares rose 2% in premarket trading after the home improvement retialer said Wednesday its fourth-quarter same-store sales climbed 28% as consumers spent more on home projects during Covid. Adjusted quarterly earnings of $1.33 per share on revenue of $20.31 billion both beat expectations. Lowe\u2019s reiterated the forecast it gave at an investor day in December. Chief Financial Officer David Denton had said home improvement sales will likely decline in 2021 as more people get Covid-19 vaccines and spend more time outside their homes.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/fi9hqg4.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Wi0fT78.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.postimg.cc/MTzr3NG5/econcal1.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/TIhMYEf.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/7Bu1KiL.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/uT5kxuP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.postimg.cc/fy84vZjY/eram0111.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/EierTCy.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/0bTAqfb.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/iXLEMTe.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/2Uo3hJ6.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/B6Gxyy4.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/pdRZP8tX/upgradesdowngrades1.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/wjh2K2ZG/upgradesdowngrades2.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/wjK2bZfN/upgradesdowngrades3.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/wgGUiRC.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/am9gbmC.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/24/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-lowes-gamestop-square-intuit-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Lowe\u2019s (LOW)** \u2013 The home improvement retailer reported quarterly profit of $1.33 per share, 12 cents a share above estimates.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, February 19, 2021**\n\nAfter opening the day higher, stocks pulled back throughout the session to finish in the red, closing out a very volatile week in the stock market. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 0.17% down, the tech-heavy Nasdaq closed 0.44% down, and the Dow (DIA) closed 0.03% down. Even though the major indexes pulled back this week, they continue to hover near record levels as optimism over additional stimulus continues to fuel higher levels of risk tolerance among market participants. \n\nThere are many encouraging developments surrounding the coronavirus. This week, the United States averaged 77,665 new coronavirus cases per day, a drop of 43% from the average of two weeks ago, according to data analyzed by the New York Times. Furthermore, [analysis from Bloomberg on Thursday ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-18/how-many-vaccine-doses-are-available-u-s-should-see-a-surge?srnd=premium)showed that the U.S. vaccine supply is poised to double from the current rate of 10 million to 15 million doses per week within the next few weeks, allowing more shots to be given in the near-term.\n\nThursday night, in an interview with CNBC, Treasury Secretary Yellen said a large stimulus package is still necessary to build up sufficient momentum for economic recovery to take off on its own. She said, \u201cWe think it\u2019s very important to have a big package \\[that\\] addresses the pain this has caused \u2013 15 million Americans behind on their rent, 24 million adults and 12 million children who don\u2019t have enough to eat, small businesses failing. I think the price of doing too little is much higher than the price of doing something big. We think that the benefits will far outweigh the costs in the longer run,\u201d she added.\u201d \n\nDespite a record low supply and a temporary pullback in December, the housing market remains very strong. According to a report by the National Association of Realtors, sales ended the month of January at a seasonally adjusted, annualized rate of 6.69 million units. That figure is 0.6 higher than December and 23.7% higher when compared with January 2020 and the second-highest sales pace since April 2006.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison vowed on Friday to press ahead with laws to force Facebook (FB) to pay news outlets for content, saying he had received support from world leaders after the social media giant blacked out all news media in the country. The US State Department said it sees the dispute as a business matter between a company and a country and is unlikely to get involved.\n* Analog Devices (ADI) target raised by Argus from $155 to $180 at Buy. Stock currently around $158\n* Applied Materials (AMAT) with a host of target raises. Consensus price target is $140 at Overweight. Stock currently around $113\n* Arista Networks (ANET) with a host of target raises. Consensus price target around $350 at Outperform. Stock currently around $308\n* Baidu (BIDU) target raised by UBS Group from $315 to $400 at Buy. Stock currently around $298\n* Crocs (CROX) target raised by Pivotal Research from $87 to $92 at Buy. Stock currently around $80\n* Intuit (INTU) target raised by Barclays from \n* 4455 to $480 at Overweight. Stock currently around $415\n* Sunnova Energy (NOVA) target raised by B. Riley from $55 to $60 at Buy. Stock currently around $47\n* Palo Alto Networks (PANW) target raised by Morgan Stanley (MS) from $425 to $515. Stock currently around $390\n* After positive earnings report, (ROKU) with a host of target raises. Conensus price target $575 at Buy. Stock currently around $450\n* The Trade Desk (TTD) with two target raises. Stock currently around $846\n   * Pivotal Research from $950 to $1010 Buy\n   * Oppenheimer from $900 to $950 at Outperform\n* WorkDay (WDAY) target raised by Evercore ISI from $290 to $320 at Outperform. Stock currently around $272\n\n\u201cAn investment in knowledge pays the best interest. \u201c Benjamin Franklin",

        "selftext": "First of all, I can't wait to be berated in the comments. \n\nI'm gonna be blunt, I have seen a whole lot of dumb shit over the last week.  A lot more than normal.  And compounding all of that is an unprecedented amount of legitimate emotional involvement here.  So let me get started by saying outright that people getting emotionally involved with trading stocks always lose.  Short, long, whatever.  It doesn't matter if you're a 19 year old throwing in your life savings or Bill fucking Ackman not being able to admit he was wrong with Herbalife.  Letting your emotions be a major factor in trading is a fantastic way to lose money. \n\nAnd a whole lot of you are really emotionally involved with this GME, AMC, whatever.\n\nTo the point: I am not making a buy/sell/hold/whatever recommendation.  I have no special insight in to what's happening with GME or whatever else.  What I can tell you is that it is for sure not worth $300.\n\nSo let's dispel one quick thing: this is not David vs Goliath.  It also isn't the little man vs hedge funds or WSB vs big finance.  It might have started out that way, but if you only read one thing [read this](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-29/reddit-traders-on-robinhood-are-on-both-sides-of-gamestop): \n\n&gt;Many of the big retail brokerages, including Robinhood, route a lot of their customer orders to Citadel Securities, so it ends up seeing a large percentage of retail trades in U.S. stocks. It can see if retail traders are mostly buying or mostly selling or mostly pretty balanced. You might expect\u2014I certainly expected\u2014to see that retail traders were buying more than they were selling this week. The stock seemed to be rocketing up on frenzied retail sentiment, and the posters on WallStreetBets were all claiming that they would never sell and keep buying until it hit $1,000.\n\n&gt;But here\u2019s what Citadel Securities\u2019 retail flow looked like in GameStop this week: 1\n\n&gt;[Graphic here](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i9SnRzR8AM1c/v0/800x-1.png)\n\n\n&gt;Retail investors were net buyers on Monday but net sellers for the rest of the week (through yesterday), and all in all quite balanced: About 49.8% of retail orders (that Citadel Securities saw) were to buy, and 50.2% were to sell.\n\n&gt;What do you make of that? One reading would be: \u201cRetail investors on Reddit might have started the GameStop rally, but they\u2019re not piling into this stock now, and the price action this week is coming from professionals.\u201d Or as one Twitter user put it, \u201cpast the retail ignition, the rocket ship was mostly intra-fast money warfare.\u201d\n\n\n\nSo, just to be clear about this, there is massive institutional money on both sides of this trade, and retail is a toddler sitting at the world series of poker.  \n\n**Understand that melvin does not need to cover in the way a retail trader needs to cover**.  \nYou, and everyone else, have no idea what Melvin's position looks like, and they can reorganize and exit a position before you ever knew it happened.  You don't know how hedged they are, you don't know what their collateral looks like, and you don't know if they've covered and restructured a short at last week's prices.  You simply don't know.  You only know what's been presented in the news, which is almost certainly bullshit.  \n\nThis thing could come to an end as fast as it started and you won't know what happened for weeks.  You might go take a shit at 1pm today and come back to GME trading at $16 because Ken Griffin got on CNBC and announced they restructured their short at an average price of $200, and were happy to sit on it.  Make no mistake, you'll get kicked in the nuts and have your ball taken away faster than you can comprehend.    \n\n**Emotions**\nThe problem with this whole \"strike back at wall street\" narrative is that lots of you are getting really worked up over this trade.  Losing money sucks, but losing money and feeling like you got shit on by the big guy is going to hurt.  This isn't a moral crusade to them, it's 25 billion dollars.  So if you're out here putting money and emotions on the line that you can't afford to lose there won't be a happy ending. \n\nWant to fight the good fight against wall street? Write your congressman, Tweet AOC or Ted Cruz, get you a fucking picket sign and go wave it around on the streeet.  But dropping money on GME that you need in life ain't gonna change anything except your net worth.\n\nTLDR: \n\n1) know and understand who is playing this game.  And that they have access to tools, leverage, and markets that you do not.  You're playing Le Chiffre at Casino Royale right now, you might think you're James Bond but there's a good chance that you're just the fat dude in the corner. \n\n2) Short squeezes end fast.  As fast as they started.  If you're new to trading then understand buying GME at this price can mean all of your money will evaporate before you had time to make a TikTock about it.\n\n3) Get your emotions out of play here.  This whole nonsense political narrative is only going to cause you to make trading mistakes.  Can't handle that?  then maybe it's not a good idea to sit at this table.  \n\nLastly, if you really just can't get yourself out of the whole \"fight the hedge funds\" nonsense, at least understand that you're spending money that you likely won't get back.  If that's worth it to you then have at it.  But don't fool yourself  in to thinking otherwise.\n\n**E: Completely unrelated**: I hate reddit awards, reddit doesn't need your money.  Go buy like a hundredth of a share of VTI or something.",

I have no idea how this simple metric isn't widely reported. \n\nHedge funds get paid more by fraudulently creating more shares when the stock goes under. They cannot cover anywhere near this price level because the shares don't exist. Manipulating the number of shares also dilutes the reported short float. Retail is holding on to shares they need and just not letting go, as some of those shares retail has are fraudulent. By the time they run out of money in interest payments dragging this out, it'll be a massive shitshow.\n\n[KEEP IT UP](https://i.redd.it/4fllvoc68we61.jpg)\n\nMore info: http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html\n\n:edit: 84 GME @ $87.16 avg.\n\n:edit 2: Please note one reason prices are still high is to encourage retail go to other stocks (looking at you AMC, BB, NOK), or get more easily duped by some scam like silver. It's always been about GME.\n\nWhen it comes time for them to pay up, expect the price to drop first.\n\n:edit 3: The price is now around where the volume dropped off.

In 1980, a rule change by the government destroyed the corner.  #silverthursday.\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday\n\n&gt;Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers\u2019 attempt to corner the market on the metal.\n\n-\n&gt;Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926\u20132014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers\u2019 Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.\n\n-\n&gt;By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged\u2014March 27\u2014silver fell to $10.80, the metal\u2019s biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, \u201cA billion dollars isn\u2019t what it used to be,\u201d the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.\n\n-\n&gt;To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978\u201391) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.",

        "selftext": "If you are panicking go to your shitty robinhood app and change it from a line chart to a candle chart, the top will show you a volume. The total since 9:30 is less than 2 million. Think logically, if this was a true panic sell do you really think the volume would be 2 million. There is 7.9 million retards in here. If we all panicked the volume would go through the roof.\n\nThis is another attack by hedge funds to force a sell-off and is absolutely meaningless since no retail investors are selling.\n\nBUY THE FUCKING DIP. WE CAN REMAIN RETARDED LONGER THAN THEY REMAIN SOLVENT\n\nEDIT: I believe Robinhood does not even report volume properly on their charts. Anyone who was saying the volume on the day is 15 million or whatever is correct and I should have thought to check a better platform before making this post. However, there is no denying that this is just another ladder attack that will prove to be ineffective as anything under 250 is a fucking discount.

Now look at the bar under that dildo, that is the volume. Is that move remotely justified by that little volume? Look at the previous days where there was massive amount of buying going on, volume was 4x on those days compared to Thursday and yet those candle sizes do not even compare.\n\nTo make this more understandable look at the retard on your left and then look at the retard on your right.

        "selftext": "We\u2019re not. Plain and simple. Anyone who frequents WSB knows this. \n\nThis means whatever media source is indicating this to be the case is a sellout and their credibility should be in serious question since they either 1) don\u2019t do their due diligence, or 2) are okay with getting their strings pulled to be used as tools by the wealthy to manipulate masses.\n\nIf there was any doubt of these hedge fund\u2019s influence and manipulate, this whole \u201cWSB going silver\u201d just put that conspiracy theory to rest and only does more to confirm that the game has always been rigged against the average person.\n\n\n\n**Edit:** You know what would be AMAZING?? This was an idea already thrown out there, but if the mods could use twitter (and by pinning a statement on this subreddit) to invalidate the silver BS... That would be SUCH a great fucking move. Maybe a message like **\"There is no sentiment among WSB members to buy SLV stock and the little that exists is under scrutiny of WSB members\"**. That would just slam the door on any sources propagating that false information and call them out on their BS (because it's just so obviously untrue). It would also make it clear for those checking the credibility of this fake news that the silver hype is a fabrication by variables outside of WSB and inform them of how convenient it is for hedge funds if people pulled from GME, and supported a stock they own massive shares of.\n\nThis goes without saying that I'm holding GME till the very end. Given how the media and some brokerages have gotten involved (and in a not so subtle way that benefits the hedge funds), it's not even about the money anymore. And that's coming from someone with student loans who stands to profit by exiting right now. Money comes and goes, but getting to witness firsthand just how rigged the system is and knowing **who's** involved in keeping people in line is just something you can't put a price tag on.",

        "selftext": "[https://i.imgur.com/6BGahUN.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/6BGahUN.jpg)\n\nBeen supporting the WSB fight against the Hedge Funds since I found out about it around a week ago. Then I found this information a few hours ago, and it has me worried for the people indefinitely holding, with the expectation of a squeeze coming soon. I'm new to the stock market but have learned a bit in the last week. Am I reading this wrong, or have the percentage of shorted shares dropped to 49.21%?\n\nIf the squeeze already happened last ~~friday~~ thursday, how is lying about it or hiding this information to keep people buying/holding GME stock, to increase personal profits, ANY different then the bullshit that Hedge Funds do? That is active manipulation and deception for personal gain, not an altruistic attempt to 'take down Goliath', which is why many people (myself included) supported/support the GME/AMC fight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven ASKING for people to explain this information to me has resulted in mass downvotes, ZERO direct responses explaining why I am wrong, and a post I made about it on WSB, was deleted within 30 seconds by mods. No explanation was provided for the quick deletion, and after asking why it was deleted, I was ignored. (edit - AND Shadowbanned, as I recently just noticed.)\n\nIs this a \"David vs. Goliath\" type of fight, or essentially a Ponzi scheme for people who invested early and/or with large funds?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I crazy/wrong, or is ignorance and greed now fueling this 'movement'? ***ANY*** explanation is greatly appreciated.\n\nedit- Shoutout to the mods here for reinstating this post after it was initially removed. The mods over at WSB shadowbanned me after I asked the same question.\n\nedit 2- Said Friday, meant Thursday.",

        "selftext": "# Remember hedge funds have the weak hand\n\nThey had to realise gains from other investments just to cover losses from GME. Thursday and Friday were the days with the biggest deleveraging sisnce March 2020. Each day they have to pay high interest just to mantain the short positions, and you know what? Every time they realise gains to cover losses their performance gets worse, and this makes them look like idiots in front of their clients, putting their business in danger.\n\n# Expect some crazy volatility\n\nRemember you are playing against hedge funds, they are not going to give you free money. There is no free money in the stock market. GME investors hit them hardly, and for them is not just about losses but they have to proof to their clients that they cannot be beaten by a bunch of redditors. They may suppress the price or manipulate it. There are some excellent posts on this sub about how they manipulate the stock price (ladder attacks, MSM misinformation, etc).\n\n# Manage your risk\n\nI hold GME since $20s. For me right now there is no risk in holding the stock because it will never go back to that level. If you just bought at $300 have in mind they may be able to supress the price for days or weeks to $100-$200 level, so you must be able to stomach this volatility. I would recommend only investing money you can afford to lose to not panic sell if you see this wild volatily.\n\nThe important thing as an investor is to hold, more than to buy like crazy.\n\n# Be a critical thinker, do your DD\n\nThere is nothing that the MSM wishes more than to see loss porn from retail investors to say \"see, they didn't know what they were doing\". Please, don't give them the opportunity to say that.\n\nDo your DD, check user history whenever you read something to make sure users are no hedge fund trolls. Hedge funds are now trying to focus you attention on everything except GME. The Silver play is a trap. Citadel is long silver. \n\n# BEWARE THAT IF YOU BUY SILVER, you are helping Citadel to cover losses with their gains and give them the chance to fight on GME.\n\nMaybe mods should ban silver posts as lots of people could potentially lose money on that play.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR:\n\nDO YOUR OWN DD. BE CRITICAL.\n\nHOLD. THEY HAVE THE WEAK HAND, NOT YOU.\n\nBEWARE OF SILVER.\n\nFor SEC minions reading this: this is not investment advice.\n\nEdit 1: many thanks for the awards guys.\n\nEdit 2: WSJ and Bloomberg are pushing the silver narrative and creating the impression that somehow people here are coordinated which is complete false. Also Citadel is long silver and it seems posts are being created mainly by bots. I definitely think mods should take action.\n\nEdit 3: about silver, it is not my call, I am just sharing my point of view, I totally get the people who says nothing should be banned. Just have in mind MSM are depicting WSB as a group of organized investors that are colluding to target different assets, which is completely false. Should their message gets acceptance because of SLV they could try to ban this sub. So I think mods should at least check if those posts are legit, and if they comply with the rules. Nothing else.",

On WeBull, I see commenters seeing short squeezes going on EVERYWHERE - including stocks with under 20% short interest. We have here an influx of retail investors. Many of them have never had a penny in the stock market before. Many of them don't understand the situation beyond what the price reflects at the moment and think that every dip is a short ladder...what's worse, many of them are vulnerable to emotional trades, having put in more than they can afford to lose but without the conditioning many traders develop after years of seeing the ups and downs.\n\nNot everything is a short squeeze.\n\nNot everything is a conspiracy theory (although the recent $SLV situation given Citadel's positions is very suspect - infer what you will)\n\nThere is no set date for the squeeze - There is NO set date for shorts to have to cover unless market conditions force them to.\n\nThe only way to win this, is to hold. Turn your share lending off if your broker allows. Ride the ups and the downs. Set you limit sell much higher than the market value - this will influence the price.\n\nMost importantly, understand: a true short squeeze will happen if shorts are FORCED to cover their positions at whatever the current price is. This is not the same as contract expiry - they are two different things.\n\nShort sellers have likely been covering as much as they can on every dip, to cover themselves. This is because shares are still being traded.\n\nDon't sell. We need to limit the supply.

We never know how far he will take this, but I know the dude is fucking brilliant. So fucking brilliant that I'm willing to give him my entire 401k to make this happen.\n\nGameStop is no longer a retailer, it is a viral company. We need to value it like a viral company.

I believe GameStop has more value. They are going to increase sales 3x or 4x. They will increase their online presence and start selling more products. This is going to be huge.

The article in question was from FD, basically the Dutch Financial Times.\n\nIt's about the following article;[https://fd.nl/beurs/1372360/gamestop-beleggers-richten-zich-op-zilvermarkt](https://fd.nl/beurs/1372360/gamestop-beleggers-richten-zich-op-zilvermarkt)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe all know damn well that the ones who bought GME are still holding it, and that no OG WSB member cares about SLV. So I asked them about their sources to justify an article about Redditors buying silver and they replied with these two sources. They basically said that they get first hand information from analysts and that they are not writing anything that is not truthful. Additionally they said they are aware of the market sentiment but that they are also aware of ''redditors driving  up the price of silver''. I sent them eight of the most popular posts of WSB of the past 24 hours to point out the market sentiment (which is GME). They provided these sources for their article;\n\n1. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6novm/the\\_real\\_dd\\_on\\_slv\\_the\\_worlds\\_biggest\\_short/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6novm/the_real_dd_on_slv_the_worlds_biggest_short/)\n2. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l68ill/the\\_biggest\\_short\\_squeeze\\_in\\_the\\_world\\_slv\\_silver/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l68ill/the_biggest_short_squeeze_in_the_world_slv_silver/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of these posts has even been deleted! I pointed out that the accounts that promote silver are mostly new accounts, or accounts that have been inactive for a long time. They said they did not see any proof for that statement and referred back to two SLV posts here.\n\nTLDR; Media ignoring the actual market sentiment\n\nPS; Yes, I can provide screenshots of the emails I wrote, but they are not in English so I figured there would be no point it posting those in WSB.\n\nDisclaimer; not financial advisor.

I'm a pants-on-head wearing retard and have possibly missed key points that would contradict my statements. Invest at your own risk.**\n\n**And yes, I own GME.**\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs we've been seeing this weekend, multiple bots have been hard pushing silver. At almost exactly the same time as this happened (EOD Friday) it was announced that SLV and futures were rising rapidly due to the 'Reddit mob' even though the vast majority of retail has no way to trade on weekends or touch futures.\n\nThis is obviously because no one has jumped on silver. Or at least not retail. The banks sure do love silver, and so do the boys at Shitadel. Shitadel is the fifth largest holder, along with several large banks.\n\n**Their strategy is probably something like this:**\n\nThey are running out of ammunition and their investors are scared. They love to hedge with commodities, and because they and their investors are scared now is the time to stock up. They've bought out most major suppliers and at the same time pushed the narrative that it was done by Reddit. Why?\n\nBecause they don't want people to know they're scared. They don't want people to know they are losing and buying commodities. This is their hedge, this is their attempt to cover their losses. They want to stock up on silver, but when they do that in large numbers the tickers and futures will spike. How do they explain that without giving away their position? \"Reddit did it.\"\n\nAfter they cause silver to spike in a meaningful way, they need someone to sell it off to. They've artificially created demand for silver and prevented suppliers from being able to sell to retail, and now it's trending on social media and boomer media. So what's the next step? How will they sell? Later on, they will push the silver narrative once more even harder, blaming Reddit for trying to collapse the dollar (because let's be real we fucking love clout) and all of the suppliers will suddenly have large amounts of silver available again for Reddit to get their hands on.\n\nThey want to egg you on, show you the proof by raising silver prices, and then sell it to you and line their pockets with your cash. Artificially raising the price and then selling it off the moment they can. There's a phrase for this but I think it keeps getting my posts removed.\n\nAnyone you see pushing SLV, AG, and physical silver is either heavily misinformed, a(u)(r)tistic beyond all belief, or paid off by a bank.\n\nYes, silver is heavily shorted. No, Reddit will not win a commodity war. Banks control actual physical supply lines, not just paper shares. There is no beating them at this game. People have tried and all but disappeared for it, multiple times.\n\nIf you want to ride their rise of silver then by all means go for it, but be aware that it is not retail investors causing this to rise. It is likely the people that need more ammo for this next week: Banks and HFs.\n\n\\-------------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\ude80 G\ud83d\ude80M \ud83d\ude80E\ud83d\ude80\n\nTL;DR\n\nBanks are blaming a spike in silver futures on Reddit to hide their own hedging, and are shilling silver here so that when it becomes available for purchase retail will pay a premium to 'get in' on a short that doesn't exist. Retail lines their pockets with money, and they get to empty their mansions of all the silver they hoarded.",

        "selftext": "Edit 1: More ARKQ buying today (~50k shares). Thank you everyone for the positive feedback and discussion! \n\nBottom Line Up Front (BLUF) or TL;DR for the non-military types:\n\nLMT is a good target if you want to literally go to the moon, and my PT is $690.26 in two years (more than 2x from current levels). Justification and some possible trade ideas are listed below, just CTRL-F \u201cTrade Ideas\u201d. I hope you guys enjoy this work and would appreciate any discussion or feedback. I hope to catch you in the comments.\n\nTeam,\n\nWe interrupt today\u2019s regularly scheduled short squeeze coverage to discuss a traditionally boring stock, LMT (Lockheed Martin), with significant upside potential. To be clear, this is NOT a short squeeze target like many reddit posts are keying on. I hope that this piece sparks discussion, but if you are just looking for short squeeze content, all I have to say is BUY, HOLD, and GODSPEED.\n\nThe source of inspiration for me writing this piece is threefold; first, retail investors are winning, and I believe that we will continue to win if we continue to identify opportunities in the market. In my view, the stock market has always been a place for the public to shine a light on areas of innovation that real Americans are excited about and proud to be a part of. Online communities have stolen the loudspeaker from hedge fund managers and returned it to decentralized online democracies that quickly and proudly shift their weight behind ideas they believe in. In GME\u2019s case, it was a blatant smear campaign to destroy a struggling business. I think that we should continue this campaign by identifying opportunities in the market and running with them. It may sound overly idealistic, but if reddit can take on the hedge funds, I non-ironically believe that we can quite literally take good companies researching space technology to the moon. I think LMT may be one of several stocks to help get us there.\n\nSecond, a video where the Secretary of State of Massachusetts argues that internet boards are full of a bunch of unsophisticated, thoughtless traders really ticked me off. This piece is designed to show that \u2018the little guy\u2019 is ready to get into the weeds, understand business plans, and outpace analysts that think companies like Tesla are overvalued by comparing them to Toyota. That is a big reason that I settled on an old, large, slow growth company to do a deep-dive on, and try my best to show some of the abysmal predictive analysis major \u2018research firms\u2019 do on even some of the most heavily covered stocks. LMT is making moves, and the suits on wall street are 10 steps behind. At the time of writing this piece, Analyst Estimates range from 330-460 (what an insane range).\n\nThird, and most importantly, I am in the US military, and I think that it is fun to go deep into the financials of the defense sector. I think that it helps me understand the long-term growth plans of the DoD, and I think that I attack these deep-dives with a perspective that a lot of these finance-from-day-one cats do not understand. Even if no one ever looks at this work, I think that taking the time to write pieces like this makes me a better Soldier, and I will continue to do it in my spare time when I am feeling inspired. I wrote a piece on Raytheon Technologies (Ticker: RTX) 6 months ago, and I think it was well-received. I was most convicted about RTX in the defense sector, but I have since shifted to believing LMT is the leader in the defense space. I am long both, though. If this inspires anyone else to do similar research on other companies, or sparks discussion in the community, that is just a bonus. Special shout-out to the folks that read more than just the TL;DR, but if you do just read the TL;DR, I love you too!\n\nNow let us get into it:\n\n**Leadership**\n\nI generally like to invest in companies that are led by people that seem to have integrity. Jim Taiclet took the reins at LMT in June of last year. While on active duty, he served as a C-141B Starlifter pilot (a retired LMT Aircraft). After getting out he went to work for the American Tower Corporation (Ticker: AMT). His first day at American Tower was September 10, 2001. The following day, AMT lost 13 employees in the World Trade Center attack. He stayed with the company, despite it being decimated by market uncertainty in the wake of 9/11. He was appointed CEO of the very same company in 2004. Over a 16 year tenure as CEO of AMT the company market cap 20x\u2019d. He left his position as CEO of AMT in March of last year, and the stock stagnated since his departure, currently trading at roughly the same market cap as to when he left.\n\nJim Taiclet was also appointed to be the chairman of the board this week, replacing the previous CEO. Why is it relevant that the CEO came from a massive telecommunications company?\n\nRightfully, Taiclet\u2019s focus for LMT is bringing military technology into the modern era. He wants LMT to be a first mover in the military 5G space, military application of AI space, the\u2026 space space, and the hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV) space. These areas are revolutionary for the boomer defense sector. We will discuss this in more detail later when we cover the company\u2019s P/E multiple and why it is absolute nonsense.\n\nIt is not a surprise to me that they brought Taiclet on during the pandemic. He led AMT through adversity before, and LMT\u2019s positioning during the pandemic is tremendous relative to the rest of the sector, thanks in large part to some strong strategic moves and good investments by current and past leadership. I think that Taiclet is the right CEO for the job.\n\nIn addition to the new CEO, the new Secretary of Defense, Secretary Lloyd Austin, has strong ties to the defense sector. He was formerly a board member for RTX. He is absolutely above reproach, and a true leader of character, but I bring this up not to suggest that he will inappropriately serve in the best interest of defense contractors, but to suggest that he speaks the language of these companies effectively. I do not anticipate that the current administration poses as significant of a risk to the defense sector as many analysts seem to believe. This will be expanded in the headwinds section below.\n\n**SPACE**\n\nCathie Wood and the ARK Invest team brought a lot of attention to the space sector when the ARKX, The ARK Space Exploration ETF, Form N-1A was officially filed through the SEC. More recently, ARK Invest published their Big Ideas 2021 Annual Report and dedicated an entire 7-page chapter to Orbital Aerospace, a new disruptive innovation platform that the ARK Team is investigating. This may have helped energize wall street to re-look their portfolios and their investments in space technology, but it was certainly not the first catalyst that pushed the defense industry in the direction of winning the *new* space race.\n\nIn June 2018, then President Trump announced at the annual National Space Council that \u201cit is not enough to merely have an American presence in space, we must have American dominance in space. So important. Therefore, I am hereby directing the Department of Defense (DoD) and Pentagon to immediately begin the process necessary to establish a Space Force as the sixth branch of the Armed Forces\". Historically, Department of Defense space assets were under the control of the Air Force. By creating a separate branch of service for the United States Space Force (USSF), the DoD would allocate a Chairman of Space Operations on the Joint Chiefs of Staff and clearly define the budget for space operations dedicated directly to the USSF. At present, this budget is funneled from the USAF\u2019s budget. The process was formalized in December of 2019, and the DoD has appropriated \\~$15B to the USSF in their first full year of existence according to the FY21 budget.\n\nAmong the 77 spacecraft that are controlled by the USSF, 29 of them are Lockheed Martin GPS satellites, 6 of them are Lockheed Martin Space-Based Infrared Systems (SBIRS), and LMT had a hand in creating and/or manufacturing for several of the other USSF efforts. The Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared Missile Warning Satellites (also known as Next-Gen OPIR) were contracted out to both Northrup Grumman (Ticker: NOC) and LMT. LMT\u2019s contract is currently set at $4.9B, NOC\u2019s contract is set at $2.37B.\n\nTangentially related to the discussion of space is the discussion of hypersonic glide vehicles (HGVs). HGVs have exoatmospheric and atmospheric implications, but I think that their technology is extremely important to driving margins down for both space exploration and terrestrial point-to-point travel. LMT is leading the charge for military HGV research. They hold contracts with the Navy, Air Force, and Army to develop HGVs and hypersonic precision fires. The priority for HGV technology accelerated significantly when Russia launched their Avangard HGV in December of 2019. Improving the technology for HGVs is a critical next-step in maintaining US hegemony, but also maintaining leadership in both terrestrial and exoatmospheric travel.\n\n**LARGE SCALE COMBAT OPERATIONS (LSCO)**\n\nThe DoD transitioning to Large-Scale Combat Operations (LSCO) as the military\u2019s strategic focus. This is a move away from an emphasis on Counter-Insurgency operations. LSCO requires effective multi-domain operations (MDO), which means effective and integrated strategies regarding land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace. To have effective MDO, the DoD is seeking systems that both expand capabilities against peer threats and increase the ability to track enemy units and communicate internally. This requires a modernizing military strategy that relies heavily on air, missile, and sensor modernization. Put simply, the DoD has decided to start preparing for peer or near-peer adversaries (China, Russia, Iran, North Korea) rather than insurgencies. For this reason, I believe that increased Chinese and Russian tensions are, unfortunate as it may be, a boon to the defense industry. This is particularly true in the missiles/fires and space industry, as peer-to-peer conflicts are won by leveraging technological advantages.\n\nThere are too many projects to cover in detail, but some important military technologies that LMT is focusing on to support LSCO include directed energy weapons (lasers) to address enemy drone technology, machine learning / artificial intelligence (most applications fall under LMT\u2019s classified budget, but it is easy to imagine the applications of AI in a military context), and 5G to increase battlefield connectivity. These projects are all nested within the DoD\u2019s LSCO strategy, and position LMT as the leader in emergent military tech. NOC is the other major contractor making a heavy push in the modernization direction, but winners win, and I think a better CEO, balance sheet, and larger market cap make LMT the clear winner for aiding the DoD in a transition toward LSCO.\n\n**SECTOR COMPARISON (BACKLOG)**\n\nThe discussion of LSCO transitions well into the discussion of defense contractor backlogs. Massive defense contracts are not filled overnight, so examining order backlogs is a relatively reliable way to gauge the interest of the DoD in a defense contractor\u2019s existing or emerging products. For my sector comparison, I am using the top 6 holdings of the iShares U.S. Aerospace &amp; Defense ETF (Ticker: ITA). I hate this ETF, and ETFs like it (DFEN) because of their massively outsized exposure to aerospace, and undersized allocation to companies like LMT. LMT is only 18% smaller than Boeing (Ticker: BA) but is only 30.4% of the exposure of BA (18.46% of the fund is BA, only 5.62% of the fund is LMT). Funds of this category are just BA / RTX hacks. I suggest building your own pie on a site like M1 Finance (although they are implicated in the trade restriction BS\u2026 please be advised of that\u2026 hoping other brokerages that are above board will offer similar UIs like the pie design\u2026 just wanted to be clear there) if you are interested in the defense sector.\n\nThe top 6 holdings of ITA are:\n\nBoeing Company (Ticker: BA, MKT CAP $110B) at 18.46%\n\nRaytheon Technologies (Ticker: RTX, MKT CAP $101B) at 17.84%\n\nLockheed Martin (Ticker: LMT, MKT CAP $90B) at 5.62%\n\nGeneral Dynamics Corporation (Ticker: GD, MKT CAP $42B) 4.78%\n\nTeledyne Technologies Incorporated (Ticker: TDY, MKT CAP $13B) at 4.74%\n\nNorthrop Grumman Corporation (Ticker: NOC, MKT CAP $48B) at 4.64%\n\nAs a brief aside, please look at the breakdowns of ETFs before buying them. The fact that ITA has more exposure to TDY than NOC and L3Harris is wild. Make sector ETFs balanced how you want them to be balanced and it will be more engaging, and you will likely outperform. I digress.\n\nBacklogs for defense companies can easily be pulled from their quarterly reports. Here are the current backlogs in the same order as before, followed by a percentage of their backlog to their current market cap. All numbers are pulled from January earning reports unless otherwise noted with an \\* because they are still pending.\n\n**Boeing Company** backlog (Commercial: $282B, Defense: $61B, Foreign Military Sales (FMS, categorized by BA as \u2018Global\u2019): 21B, Total Backlog 364B): BA\u2019s backlog to market cap is a ratio of 3.32, which is strong, but most of that backlog comes from the commercial, not the defense side. Airlines have been getting decimated, I am personally not interested in having much of my backlog exposed to commercial pressures when trying to invest in a defense play. Without commercial exposure, their defense only backlog ratio is .748. This is extremely low. I understand that this does not do BA justice, but I am keying in on defense exposure, and I am left thoroughly unsatisfied by that ratio. Also, we have seen several canceled contracts already on the commercial side.\n\n**Raytheon Technologies** backlog (Defense backlog for all 4 subdivisions: 67.3B): Raytheon only published a defense backlog in this quarter\u2019s report. That is further evidence to me that the commercial aerospace side of the house is getting hammered. They have a relatively week backlog to market cap as well, putting them at a ratio of .664, worse off than the BA defense backlog.\n\n**Lockheed Martin** backlog (Total Backlog: $147B): This backlog blows our first two defense backlogs out of the water with a current market cap to backlog ratio of 1.63.\n\n**General Dynamics Corporation** backlog (Total Backlog: $89.5B, $11.6B is primarily business jets, but it is difficult to determine how much of their aerospace business is commercial): Solid 2.13 ratio, still great 1.85 if you do not consider their aerospace business. The curveball here for me is that GD published a consolidated operating profit of $4.1B including commercial aerospace, whereas LMT published a consolidated operating profit of $9.1B. This makes the LMT ratio of profit/market cap slightly in favor of LMT without accounting for the GD commercial aerospace exposure. This research surprised me; I may like GD more than I originally assumed I would. Still prefer LMT.\n\n**Teledyne Technologies Incorporated** backlog (Found in the earnings transcript, $1.7B): This stock is not quite in the same league as the other major contractors. This is an odd curveball that a lot of the defense ETFs seem to have too much exposure to. They have a weak backlog, but they are a smaller growing company. I am not interested in this at all. It has a backlog ratio of .129.\n\n**Northrop Grumman Corporation** backlog ($81B): Strong numbers here. I see NOC and LMT as the two front-runners in the defense sector. I like LMT more because I like their exposure to AI, 5G, and HGVs more than NOC, but I think this is a great alternative to LMT if you like the defense sector. Has a ratio of 1.69, slightly edging out LMT on this metric. LMT edges out NOC on margins by \\~.9%, though, which has significant implications when considering the depth of the LMT backlog.\n\nThe winners here are LMT, GD, and NOC. BA is attractive if you think anyone will have enough money to buy new planes. BA and RTX are both getting hammered by commercial aerospace exposure right now and are much more positioned as recovery plays. That said, LMT and NOC both make money now, and will regardless of the impact of the pandemic. LMT is growing at a slightly faster rate than NOC. Both are profit machines, but I like LMT\u2019s product portfolio and leadership a lot more.\n\n**FREE CASH FLOW**\n\nDespite the pandemic, LMT had the free cash flow to be able to pay a $2.60 per share dividend. This maintains their \\~3% yearly dividend rate. They had a free cash flow of $6.4B. They spent $3.9 of that in share repurchases and dividend payouts. That leaves 40% of that cash to continue to strengthen one of the most stalwart balance sheets outside of big tech on the street. Having this free cash flow allowed them to purchase Aerojet Rocketdyne for $4.4B in December. They seem flexible and willing to expand and take advantage of their relative position during the pandemic. This is a stock that has little downside risk and significant upside potential. It is always reassuring to me to know that at the end of the day, a company is using its profit to continue to grow.\n\n**HEADWINDS**\n\n**New Administration** \u2013 This is more of an unknown than a headwind. The Obama Administration was not light on military spending, and the newly appointed SecDef is unlikely to shy away from modernizing the force. Military defense budgets may get lost in the political shuffle, but nothing right now suggests that defense budgets are on the chopping block.\n\n**Macroeconomic pressure** \u2013 The markets are tumultuous in the wake of GME. Hedgies are shaking in their boots, and scared money weighed on markets the past week. If scared money continues to exert pressure on the broader equity markets, all boomer stocks are likely weighed down by slumping markets.\n\n**Non-meme Status** \u2013 The stocks that are impervious to macroeconomic pressures in the above paragraph are the stonks that we, the people, have decided to support. From GME to IPOE, there is a slew of stonks that are watching and laughing from the green zone as the broader markets slip deeper into the red zone. Unless sentiment about LMT changes, I see no evidence that LMT will remain unaffected by a broader economic downturn (despite showing growth YoY during a pandemic).\n\n**TAILWINDS**\n\n**Aerojet Rocketdyne to the Moon** \u2013 Cathie Wood opened up a $39mil position in LMT a few weeks ago, and this was near the announcement of ARKX. The big ideas 2021 article focuses heavily on satellite technology, deep learning, and HGVs. I think that the AR acquisition suggests that vertical integration is a priority for LMT. They even fielded a question in their earnings call about whether they were concerned about being perceived as a monopoly. Their answer was spot on\u2014the USFG and DoD have a vested interest in the success of defense companies. Why would they discourage a defense contractor from vertical integration to optimize margins?\n\n**International Tensions** \u2013 SolarWinds has escalated US-Russia tensions. President Biden wants to look tough on China. LSCO is a DoD-wide priority.\n\n**5G.Mil** \u2013 We still do not have a lot of fidelity on what this looks like, but the military would benefit in a lot of ways if we had world-wide access to the rapid transfer of encrypted data. Many units still rely on Vietnam-era technology signal technology with abysmal data rates. There are a lot of implications if the code can be cracked to win a DoD 5G contract.\n\n**TRADE IDEAS**\n\n**Price Target:** LMT is currently at a P/E of \\~14. Verizon has roughly the same. LMT\u2019s 5-year P/E ratio average is \\~17. NOC is currently at a P/E of \\~20. TSLA has a P/E Ratio of 1339 (disappointingly not 1337). P/E is a useless metric because no one seems to care about it. My point is that LMT makes a lot of money, and other companies that are valued at much higher multiples do not make any money at all. LMT\u2019s P/E ratio is that of a boomer stock that has no growth potential. LMT\u2019s P/E is exactly in line with the Aerospace and Defense Industry P/E ratio standard. LMT\u2019s new CEO is pushing the industry in a new direction. I will arbitrarily choose a P/E ratio of 30, because it is half of the software industry average, and it is a nice round number. Plus, stock values are speculative and nonsense anyway.\n\nShare price today: $321.82\n\nShare price based on LMT average 5-year P/E: $384.08 (I see this as a short term PT, reversion to the mean)\n\nShare price with a P/E of 30: $690.26\n\n**Buy and Hold:** Simple. Doesn\u2019t take much thought. Come back in a year or two and be happy with your tendies (and a few dividends to boot).\n\n**LEAPS Call Debit Spread (Based on last trade prices):** Buy $375 C 20 JAN 23 for $26.5, Sell $450 C 20 JAN 23 for $12. Total Cost $14.5 for a spread width of $75. Max gain 517% per spread. Higher risk strategy.\n\n**LEAPS**: Buy $500 C 20 JAN 23 for $7.20. Very high-risk strat. If the price target is hit within two years, these would be in the money $183 per contract for a gain of 2500%. This is the casino strat.\n\n**SOURCES**\n\n[https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/news/features/2020/james-taiclet-from-military-pilot-to-successful-ceo.html](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/news/features/2020/james-taiclet-from-military-pilot-to-successful-ceo.html)\n\n[https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/in-response-to-senator-warrens-questions-secretary-of-defense-nominee-general-lloyd-austin-commits-to-recusing-himself-from-raytheon-decisions-for-four-years](https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/in-response-to-senator-warrens-questions-secretary-of-defense-nominee-general-lloyd-austin-commits-to-recusing-himself-from-raytheon-decisions-for-four-years)\n\n[https://news.lockheedmartin.com/2019-08-30-Lockheed-Martins-Expertise-in-Hypersonic-Flight-Wins-New-Army-Work](https://news.lockheedmartin.com/2019-08-30-Lockheed-Martins-Expertise-in-Hypersonic-Flight-Wins-New-Army-Work)\n\n[https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/hypersonics.html](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/hypersonics.html)\n\n[https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1\\_Download\\_Files\\_ARK-Invest/White\\_Papers/ARK%E2%80%93Invest\\_BigIdeas\\_2021.pdf?hsCtaTracking=4e1a031b-7ed7-4fb2-929c-072267eda5fc%7Cee55057a-bc7b-441e-8b96-452ec1efe34c](https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ARK-Invest/White_Papers/ARK%E2%80%93Invest_BigIdeas_2021.pdf?hsCtaTracking=4e1a031b-7ed7-4fb2-929c-072267eda5fc%7Cee55057a-bc7b-441e-8b96-452ec1efe34c)\n\n[https://www.deseret.com/2018/6/19/20647309/twitter-reacts-to-trump-s-call-for-a-space-force](https://www.deseret.com/2018/6/19/20647309/twitter-reacts-to-trump-s-call-for-a-space-force)\n\n[https://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/Documents/defbudget/fy2021/fy2021\\_Budget\\_Request\\_Overview\\_Book.pdf](https://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/Documents/defbudget/fy2021/fy2021_Budget_Request_Overview_Book.pdf)\n\n[https://www.airforcemag.com/lockheed-receives-up-to-4-9-billion-for-next-gen-opir-satellites/](https://www.airforcemag.com/lockheed-receives-up-to-4-9-billion-for-next-gen-opir-satellites/)\n\n[https://spacenews.com/northrop-grumman-gets-2-3-billion-space-force-contract-to-develop-missile-warning-satellites/](https://spacenews.com/northrop-grumman-gets-2-3-billion-space-force-contract-to-develop-missile-warning-satellites/)\n\n[https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/directed-energy/laser-weapon-systems.html](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/directed-energy/laser-weapon-systems.html)\n\n[https://emerj.com/ai-sector-overviews/lockheed-martins-ai-applications-for-the-military/](https://emerj.com/ai-sector-overviews/lockheed-martins-ai-applications-for-the-military/)\n\n[https://www.defenseone.com/business/2020/07/new-ceo-wants-lockheed-become-5g-player/167072/](https://www.defenseone.com/business/2020/07/new-ceo-wants-lockheed-become-5g-player/167072/)\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/defense-firms-expect-higher-spending-11548783988](https://www.wsj.com/articles/defense-firms-expect-higher-spending-11548783988)\n\n[https://www.etf.com/ITA#efficiency](https://www.etf.com/ITA#efficiency)\n\n[https://s2.q4cdn.com/661678649/files/doc\\_financials/2020/q4/4Q20-Presentation.pdf](https://s2.q4cdn.com/661678649/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/4Q20-Presentation.pdf)\n\n[https://investors.rtx.com/static-files/dfd94ff7-4cca-4540-bc4b-4e3ba92fc646](https://investors.rtx.com/static-files/dfd94ff7-4cca-4540-bc4b-4e3ba92fc646)\n\n[https://investors.lockheedmartin.com/static-files/64e5aa03-9023-423a-8908-2aae8c7015ac](https://investors.lockheedmartin.com/static-files/64e5aa03-9023-423a-8908-2aae8c7015ac)\n\n[https://s22.q4cdn.com/891946778/files/doc\\_financials/2020/q4/GD\\_4Q20\\_Earnings\\_Highlights-Outlook-Final.pdf](https://s22.q4cdn.com/891946778/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/GD_4Q20_Earnings_Highlights-Outlook-Final.pdf)\n\n[https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/teledyne-technologies-inc-tdy-q4-2020-earnings-cal/](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/teledyne-technologies-inc-tdy-q4-2020-earnings-cal/)\n\n[https://investor.northropgrumman.com/static-files/6e6e117f-f656-4c68-ba7f-3dc53c2dd13a](https://investor.northropgrumman.com/static-files/6e6e117f-f656-4c68-ba7f-3dc53c2dd13a)",

        "selftext": "So there's a lot of controversy going on regarding the idea of a silver squeeze. After what happened with gamestop, I'm convinced that this shit really might work out. On the other hand there are a lot of people thinking that this is just something to draw attention away from GME and withdraw fund from the stock. Let me assure you this is not my attention. And if you're all about GME I suggest reading here because it's a waste of time.\n\nI personally think that slv really might be the next big thing that could work out. Therefore I'd suggest to not go against the idea generally. Keep your hands at gamestop as long as you want, but once work is done, get together into this next big thing.\n\n\\*\\*Here's what happens or might happen:\\*\\*About the theory of the silversqueeze. Can't really be compared to the GME squeeze as it is not about squeezing out hedgefunds shortsellers in particular. The idea is that the silver price is priced way too low for the amount of silver that physically exists. The silvermarket volume on paper (exchanges/Futures..) is 250 times bigger than the supply of physical silver (just read this and didn't do my own DD if numbers are correct). The Idea is that a physical shortage will be caused and this would really let slv skyrocket with all that derivatives that are not backed. Now imagine some 7 million apes and the following retail investors that come after suddenly plunger the physical silver market...\n\nExample: Let's assume there is a shortage and Person A wants physical delivery of the future he bought. Person B as the seller needs to deliver 5000 ounces of silver. If supply is short, the person buys another future from Person C in order to be able to deliver the slv needed. You understand the reaction this causes.\n\nAlso the silver market is said to be manipulated and kept low for a long time. I have no opinion on this.\n\n\\*\\*What happened on the weekend?\\*\\*Silver already surged 20% since friday morning which was most likely a result of the news of \"Wallstreetbets taking over silver\" and \"Shortage in silver supply\".example: [https://twitter.com/bitpanda/status/1356023060814585859](https://twitter.com/bitpanda/status/1356023060814585859)Also I noticed several locals stores and online stores being sold out completely on silver and it looks like this is not only regarding a few small dealers.[https://www.theepochtimes.com/reddit-forum-sparks-physical-silver-shortage-on-major-dealers-websites\\_3679079.html](https://www.theepochtimes.com/reddit-forum-sparks-physical-silver-shortage-on-major-dealers-websites_3679079.html)Also social media generates a lot of heat.\n\nSo it look's like it's happening - if we're heading to a global shortage, prices could absolutely go to the moon and this is a big time chance to be with it at the beginning right now. Additionally there is a good chance that shortsellers have learnt from what was happening with GME and they might get out of their short positions earlier which will generate further momentum.\n\n**What you can do** in order to participate and make this work:It does not help the cause if you buy mining companys (even though it might generate good income). But still, in order moon the prices, you'll need to invest physically. The options are:\\* Buying silver futures and let it physically deliver. Only possible if you can easily invest some 150k.\\* Buying slv or pslv if you live at the hamburgers, and for instance \"Xtrackers physical silber\" if you're from Europe. It's really important that you check if the fund needs to fully physically cover it's assets (=buy silver). Because not all do so.\\* The next option is to physically buy silver at your local store or webshop.\\* At last, you can buy options. Your counterpart might want to hedge the positions and therefore will potentially be covered. This is also obviously the part where you can win big time (or lose everything). My weapon of choice is:  34.00C expiring in April\n\nI prefer a mix of above.\n\nBut as we all know, I'm just another ape sharing brainfarts, hence I'm definitely not in the position to give financial advice. Also I'm long on slv, silver options and bought the silver of some local shops.\n\nTL;DR:This post is **NOT about GME**. No selly selly - I get the hype! But silver might be one of the best chances for the upcoming weeks I believe. And today it's still a chance to get in early at low prices.\n\ne/okay, guess we have to wait until GME is through. Looks like most in here aren't open for a new relationsship. Anything that's not GME/AMC gets downvoted to hell. ITT: People with weak hands scared of any funds going from gme to slv - this is ridiculous.  \n\ne2/ Thx for gold, even though silver would have done it!",

        "selftext": "Here is a follow-up to my trending stocks experiment. I choose the top 10 stocks from a website that I have previously posted about. (I think the auto-mod is deleting my post if I put the link). I then choose this sub in the 48 hr time frame. I put 5% of my account balance into it. if it doubles, I sell half. If it drops 40%, I sell it all. If it doesn't show up any longer in the top 50 for the last 7 days, I sell it all. (This last past is somewhat of a moving target. I haven't quite figured out when to sell if it isn't trending. I have actually had stocks continue to have a solid upward trend in their price, but nobody talks about them anymore for some reason. I have had others that continue to be talked about but have had significant losses).\n\nI had meant to do an update over the weekend, but just got busy with life. Anyway, last week was a crazy week. At one point I was up by a ton but then when the frenzy surrounding a few unnamed stocks hit, I had some substantial losses as well.

Specifically, GTCH, ATVK, OBLN. I think with each, I happened to buy the peak and rode it down.\n\nI did make an executive decision to not buy any of the stocks that are being manipulated by WSB, shorters and hedge funds. I just didn't think it would be good for the experiment. It would have thrown off the numbers dramatically and it could have been huge gains or huge losses depending on when I bought or sold. If there are those that made some good gains and went ahead and bought them, good for you. Overall, the account balance is about $2700. It started at $1900 20 days ago, so a total gain of 50%.

        "selftext": "**Current Conditions of the Market:**\n\nLet me be clear: this is not the typical conditions of the market where stocks fluctuate double and triple digit percentages per day. There\u2019s a place for that - the casino. In recent weeks, herds of new traders are pouring into the trading scene hoping to get a piece of the volatile market that has turned the rags to riches, or the other way around. The stock market as a whole, under normal conditions, moves gradually in both directions, guided by trends, innovation, speculation, earnings report, and financial changes. What we are in right now is a hysteria-filled environment that is risky for both veteran traders and novices. Any uninformed, reckless decision can produce different results - by chance. Be wise and do not let chance underlie your success or bankruptcy stories. Please do your research first before investing into anything and whatever you do, do not make the mistake of over-extending yourself with margin (brokerage-provided capital) that you cannot repay should things go south. People have and continue to make this fundamental mistake that will ruin them financially for years. Stock investments should be about long-term growth, stability, and supplemental to your income. Investments should give you access to the opportunity of financial freedom, but should not be your primary source for income. Do not listen to stock gurus and paid-only discord groups - they don\u2019t make money from stocks, they make money from you. Lastly, this atypical market condition is the perfect storm for spontaneous \u201cpump and dumps\u201d where stocks become inflated, and based on fool\u2019s theory or musical chairs (whichever you prefer), the last one that gets out gets burned. Be smart, be patient, do the research.\u00a0\n\n**Basic Stock Jargons &amp; Short/Long Positions:**\n\n*Long* \\- you\u2019re buying and holding a stock with the intention for it to increase in value.\n\n*Short* \\- you\u2019re borrowing shares from a lender (brokerage, investment firm, individual investors), selling it to someone, and hoping to buy it back at a lower price. Your profit is the difference in the sell and buy back price. I\u2019ll provide a real world example because this concept it a bit more complex:\n\n* Person A is a share lender. They want to lend the share and get paid a small interest rate as compensation.\n* Person B asks Person A to lend him that share temporarily. Person B does not pay anything upfront, but he promises to pay Person A in the form of interest over time.\n* Person B finds a buyer Person C. Person C wants to buy a stock so it can go up. Person C is \u201clong\u201d on this stock. Person B, however, is short on this stock because he wants the value of the stock to go down.\n* Person C pays Person B $10 for the stock. Now, Person C has spent $10, and Person B has gained $10.\u00a0\n* Two hypothetical situation happens now:\n   * Scenario 1: Stock value increases to $15. Person C is now up $5 and he sells because he\u2019s making nice gains. Person B needs to buy back that share at $15, but he only gained $10 profit initially. Now he needs to fork up $5 to buy back the share, and then return the share back to the lender + any interest accrued. In this scenario, the \u201cshort\u201d lost money, the \u201clong\u201d gained money, and the \u201clender\u201d made interest money.\u00a0\n   * Scenario 2: Stock value decreases to $5. Person C is now down $5 and he sells to cut losses. Person B needs to buy back that share at $5, but he already has $10 in profit initially. Now he pays $5 for the share, leaving him still with $5 profit, and returns the share back to the lender + any interested accrued. In this scenario, the \u201cshort\u201d made money, the \u201clong\u201d lost money, and the \u201clender\u201d made interest money.\u00a0\n* The above scenarios help to show why \u201cshorts\u201d (typically hedge funds or experienced traders) might want to manipulate the stock price to go down. Hedge funds have an incredible amount of power in the market, which I will explain in a bit, and can often create serious price movements to invoke price action that benefits themselves. Shorts, therefore, have the opposite intention of longs. They want share prices to go down, and in the process, can bankrupt certain companies that rely on the stock market liquidity to stay afloat. In other words, when investors leave a stock because it is dropping in value, the company loses that money that they could have used to pay off debt, grow the business, develop new products, pay for expenses, etc.\u00a0\n\n**Market Manipulation:**\n\nMarket manipulation is not new to the scene. Investors have long known of the existence of stock market manipulation tactics, and every day, we may observe some levels of manipulation in specific stocks, specific categories or industries of stocks, or the entire market. Market manipulation is defined as any actions performed with the intention of moving a certain stock price in favor of the manipulator. In this case, these are the wealthy \u201cwhales\u201d or hedge funds, both of which have enormous capital capable of shifting stock prices at alarming speeds. Keep in mind, not all hedge funds do this and not all hedge funds are \u201cshorts\u201d. Some are \u201cneutral\u201d and act as lenders to make money, some are \u201cgrowth-based\u201d and invest just like everyday traders with the intention of raising share prices, and others are \u201cshort\u201d which are probably perceived to be the sadistic groups of the bunch. Below, I will be discussing how manipulation occurs and on different scales.\n\n**Manipulation Tactics on a Spectrum:**\n\nMarket manipulation can happen in certain stock, sectors, or the entire market. There are probably far more types of manipulative tactics than we know, but I will describe the most basic types and the strategies behind it.\n\n*Scenario 1:*\n\nLet\u2019s say a hedge fund just opened a short position on stock X. Stock X is rising in value because general investors see it as a potential growth stock. Hedge funds are not too excited about this increased share value, so they can \u201chedge\u201d or protect themselves, by selling put options. When they sell puts, they are anticipating that the stock will continue to surge, which causes the puts to become worthless at expiration, but on the contrary, they will be collecting the \u201cpremium\u201d or money paid upfront by traders that bought the put. At the same time, this hedge fund will slowly \u201ccover\u201d, or buy shares of Stock X, so that the increased value of the shares will offset the short position which is losing money. The manipulation here is by using the sheer amount of capital in hand to bolster the stock, both creating favorable conditions for the puts that they sold and the share that they purchased as cover. If they want to add another level of manipulation to this, they can also purchase call options, which will result in profit if the stock price goes up. In this scenario, hedge funds make money at the expense of put option buyers and other shorts that do not have manipulative power or capital to recreate this same strategy.\n\n*Scenario 2:*\n\nLet\u2019s say a hedge fund just opened a short position on Stock X. Stock X is rising in value because general investors see it as a potential growth stock. This hedge fund does not want to risk extra capital to cover their short position (by buying shares, selling put options, or buying call options), so they try a different route. Keep in mind that hedge funds are typically heavily invested in many stocks and assets, meaning they have a lot of power in deciding the direction of many stocks that have potential to instill widespread fear across the entire market if it drops. Take for example, if Apple and Google began to hurl downwards, this can create panic in the market where everyday traders might sell their shares at a loss. This in turn might ripple through the market as other investors in other stocks are predicting a downward trajectory across the market since these big name stocks are losing value so rapidly. Conveniently enough, hedge funds own a lot of these big name \u201cFANG\u201d stocks.\n\n\u00a0If I am a moderately sadistic hedge fund, I can sell off a large holding of shares (in the scale of multi millions or billions) that are in the same sector as Stock X, which would incite fear across the sector, creating panic sell offs. The price will drop sharply across the board, including Stock X, and the short position will produce big profits. Because this hedge fund sold off a large chunk of their shares at a good price, they can now cover their short position (essentially getting rid of it), and then buy up these same stocks that were let go earlier, only this time at a much cheaper price. The hedge fund has now made money not only on the short position, but now they got into the stock at a cheap price in which they can explore other manipulative tactics to bolster the price again. This can be done by encouraging analyst upgrades, publicizing \u201cnewly\u201d purchased positions without disclosing the fact that they previously owned it, etc.\u00a0\n\n*Scenario 3:*\n\nThis one involves technology: algorithm trading (commonly referred to as algo trading). This one is a really intricately designed manipulative tactic that investors really have no way of getting around. Algorithm trading is the process of using high-speed super-computers and a team of traders to constantly monitor market activity and trade when opportunities arise. In this case, the hedge funds do not have to do any direct manipulation of the market, which makes this 100% legal. How this works is by taking advantage of how trading works and the time it takes for a trade to be made. For you general investors, we have mobile apps and web-based trading platforms to trade. When we like a stock, we have to go through the motion of inputting the stock ticker symbol, the amount of shares, the price we are willing to pay, hit submit, and confirm the trade. For hedge funds using algorithm trading, all this is done autonomously, which makes submission of an order several magnitudes quicker. When an order is submitted, it goes through a brokerage (Fidelity, Webull, ETrade, TDA, RH, etc.) and the data is rerouted to a clearing house (intermediate party that verifies and processes the trade). Clearing houses are responsible for making sure your orders are filled, but they take it on a first come first serve basis. So if a stock is moving quickly, hedge funds have a serious edge in getting in cheaper and faster as well as getting out higher and faster.\u00a0\n\nAlgorithm trading is integratable as part of the buying and selling strategies mentioned in the two previous scenarios, which is why they can almost guarantee profit. Algorithm trading also uses a lot of data in their backbone to determine the trades that have a high chance of profitability, and it acts on various factors such as volatility, volume, interest activity, news, etc. In some cases, these algorithms can be set to do some extremely sadistic things. I\u2019ll start by talking about \u201cmarket orders\u201d vs \u201climit orders\u201d. Before you make a trade on your brokerage, you will notice an option that says \u201cmarket order\u201d or \u201climit order\u201d. Market orders are an agreement that you will purchase the stock or option contract at the best price in the market in the momentary space in time. There is of course a huge risk to that because in that short moment in time, there may not be anyone selling at a good price, and instead, some people might set sell limits at ridiculous prices. For example, some people set a sell limit at $1000 for GME. If you did a market order, and you get really unlucky, you might end up snagging a share for $1000 each, when the actual share value might be $300. However, when you set a \u201climit order\u201d, you are agreeing to buy a share at a maximum price that you designated.\u00a0\n\nIn the event that a hedge fund siphons a ton of shares of a company, the algorithm can be set to sell these shares at a ridiculous sell limit. Remember, when they buy or sell, it\u2019s processed significantly faster at the clearing houses, so if you\u2019re that one unlucky trader that went for a market order on a stock, you might end up purchasing it at a huge premium set by the hedge funds themselves. Moral of the story: DO NOT PURCHASE AS MARKET ORDER - ALWAYS PURCHASE AT LIMIT ORDER.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m am not a financial advisor, so take everything I said as gibberish.",

So WELCOME TO THE GANG, GANG &amp;lt;3_\n\n**\n\nTHESIS: The big short squeeze has already happened.**\n\n**\n\nWhen?**\n\nApproximately from the when our lord and savior Burry probably cashed out\n(sometime before his settlement date for 13-F filing coming out in 2 weeks\ntime) to when the news broke and Cramer shat his pants on CNBC last Monday.\n\n**\n\nWhy do you think this?**\n\nFirst, MELVIN was NOT the ONLY ones SHORT, they were just\nthe slowest ones to cover (and hence probably will continue to be the poster-child for\nbukkake gang-rape by millennials and zoomers with stimmy checks).\n\nSecond, GME literally went from $5 per share to $37 per\nshare by January 15, 2021, the settlement date for the latest short float\nupdate (I\u2019ll come back to your fucking daily updates from S3 Partners and Ortex\nlater on, and why I don\u2019t trust them).\n\nTo put it into perspective for these unscrupulous, criminal,\nBIG money positions on the short-side that have been here a LOOOONG time,\nthat\u2019s already a 750% loss.\n\nIf someone had put in **JUST** $1M in August 2020 (by the\nway, the short float % was around 99% at this time, so I KNOW more got in short\nafter this) hoping for a Gamestop bankruptcy, by Jan 15, 2021 these fuckers\nwould have lost $8M in total (initiating position would have been about 200K\nshares short, by the time it gets to 1/15/2021, $37 x 200K shares =\u00a0 $7.4M.\n\nSo, by wagering $1M on the short side, you now have to buy\nback and return your shares. You now have a $6.4M loss.\n\n**WELL THAT FUCKING SUCKS? Right? Well then what does a 400-IQ,\nuncircumcized-dick hedgie with a wedgie want to do about this situation? They\nGOTTA make that loss back SOMEWAY SOMEHOW.**\n\nYou could suck trucker dick or deal drugs, but these\nwhite-collar yuppies have enough power to NOT have to stoop down to that level.\n\n**\n\nHere is how they CAN, and probably ARE, doing it right\nnow:**\n\nMelvin wasn\u2019t the only short position. Just the most\nretarded one that didn\u2019t cover in time, so they had to go through a whole\nfucking liquidity crisis, class action lawsuit, and dick-eating meme-fest while\nliterally asking for sugar-daddy money. What about the less retarded short\npositions? Well, they probably have some losses too, because I mean, they did\nget squeezed in the earlier portion of the play, but now they have sights on\nsomething else.\n\n**First, your hedgies (excluding Melvin &amp; Citron)\ncontinue to push the narrative: \u201cThrow Melvin &amp; Citron to the masses and\nkeep the retail investors coming in with their diamond hands and high school\ndiplomas.\u201d**\n\nSecond, **hedgies go LONG on GME shares now**. WTF HOW?\nWell remember that for short positions, there are LENDERS of these shares.\nThese lenders would happily let go of their positions at the \u201ctop\u201d of a\nsqueeze. (It\u2019s ez fucking profit, and they want none of this mess).\n\nThird, you now have a long position with underlying shares.\nWhat\u2019s the best play here? You fucking write call options because the vol\npremiums are literally mooning at the moment. And I\u2019ve been on WSB long enough\nto know that WSB\u2019s risk management is literally just selling one-paired organ\nto afford the option premium on FDs.\n\nLastly, you push the narrative of a \u201cGAMMA SQUEEZE\u201d which is\nJUST a little bit too hard for your average joe from Mississippi to understand\nwith his Algebra 2 from high school \u2013 Essentially telling him, \u201cHEY THERES\nSTILL MORE TO SQUEEEEEZE.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n**\n\nREAL Gs MOVE IN SILENCE:**\n\nLook at the volumes, the float rotation in the past week for\nGME is already enough to have fucked virgins 20 times and sacrificed them to\ncapitalist gods. \n\nWhich means for hedgies with wedgies, it\u2019s no longer a\ntail-risk, blind-side event, it\u2019s time to REAP the souls of every stimmy check\nfool, by \u201cMaRkET MAkInG\u201d.\n\nIf I am that Hedgie, I write call options, while maintaining\na fa\u00e7ade that I will \u201crationally\u201d hedge those positions by buying more of the\nunderlying shares. FUN FACT: I already have them.\n\nYou stimmy check tards will keep buying into GME, because\nyou heard about it in the news over the weekend and want to get in on this\naction to \u201cSTICK IT TO THE MAN\u201d because 2020 has been an absolute suicidal\ndescent into madness because of COVID. You will probably go on for a couple\nmore days this upcoming week, now that liquidity restrictions are slowly being\nlifted on trading platforms.\n\nSO, while you fools supply buying volume, all I have to do\nis collect my premiums on option sales, while slowly unwinding my underlying\nshare positions, and thereby also managing risk of option assignment since I\u2019ll\nsell shares into every spike and swerve the price away from the strike price of\nYOUR options.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll also have an expectation as to where GME could\npotentially rise to. You just look at the WSB subscriber count, multiply that\nby the avg retail trader account liquidity.\n\nYou guys will think you have stuck it to the man, but the\nman is sticking your wife ALREADY, ever since the moment you got angry and\nemotional about an opportunity to unleash your pent up hatred towards the Wall\nStreet system. All I am saying is, for every tard like Melvin, there\u2019s 20 other\nhedgies out there to fuck you up without you even realizing it. After all it\u2019s\ndone, they\u2019ll even make you feel bad, saying you were \u201cGreedy\u201d and \u201cReckless\u201d,\nfurther perpetuating emotional volatility in markets that they will keep\nprofiting off of.\n\nSo while the retail GME HODLER thinks there\u2019s still enough\ngold raining from the top of midtown Manhattan, all they\u2019re getting is piss and\npre-cum.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**\n\nAPPENDIX \u2013 Ortex &amp; S3 Partners**\n\nIf you got all the way through until now, I apologize for my\nlack of presentation in this thesis, it\u2019s literally 3AM in the East Coast US\nbecause I\u2019m up for 4AM pre-market (don\u2019t fucking judge me, I\u2019m a retard too).\n\nSo I\u2019ll explain that point from WAY up there about short\ninterest estimates.\n\nI don\u2019t give a flying fuck what Ortex and S3 Partners says.\nI do NOT believe that short float is STILL above %100 after the official data\ncame out on 1/27 with a lag of two fucking weeks from its settlement date on\n1/15. The stock price moved so egregiously that every autist in Manhattan would\nhave literally gone bankrupt if they\u2019re still short, NOT just Melvin.\n\nSee, here\u2019s the thing. If the system is ALREADY built with\nthis **two weeks lag** on short data for individual stocks, what fucking\ndata analytics company in their right mind would NOT try to take advantage of\nthis time &amp; information arbitrage? The system is FUCKED, but it gets\nperpetuated because the ones perpetuating this have the MOST to gain.\n\nOrtex and S3 Partners is purely a marketing ploy, they\nhopped on this gravy train to get your subcriptions and some more clicky-clicks\non their website traffic so they can use those metrics to raise some more funds\nlater on.\n\nAnd even if they believed in your cause, no smart data\nanalytics firm would willingly give up that information arbitrage to the\npublic, if they want to ever think about doing business with ANY hedge-fund in\ntown.\n\nTherefore, I am sticking to my autistic thought that the\nsystem is stacked (which most of you agree) against us. BUT, I urge you to be a\nlittle bit more careful, because short float data can be misleading at best and\na total fraudulent bull-trap at worst. \n\nAgain, If you are new here, welcome to the gang. This sub\nwill always be about losing money and becoming best friends with your wife\u2019s\nboyfriend. But over time, it will be about the friends and knowledge you gained\nalong the way.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**\n\nThank you for listening to my ted-talk. I expect a PHD\ntag for my 8-inch dick.**",

        "selftext": "Full Disclosure: I still have long options and hold a small number of shares but cashed much of my position late last week.  I'm down on what's in play, but overall way ahead. \n\n\\----\n\n Many here will immediately downvote this because they do not want you to consider any potential future other than the rosy, all your dreams will come true picture they've been hyping over the last several days. They want you to hold no matter what happens. That's not because it's in your best interests but because it's in theirs.  They'll tell you to ignore the naysayers. Ignore those trying to keep you from achieving your dreams and that anyone telling you to do anything other than HOLD is a corporate shill working for the hedge funds. Now ask yourself, why? \n\nWhat you have to remember is that you are playing against the smartest, most well capitalized and technologically sophisticated people and organizations on the planet.  Yes this is an unprecedented event, but that doesn't mean there aren't ways for this to be resolved and avoiding the infinity squeeze that everyone here is praying for.  You're fighting an uphill battle against a relatively small number of organizations that are playing both sides of this trade already. \n\n**There's still time to limit your downside risk**\n\nGains and losses don't exist until you exit your position. Until then, all you have is a paper gain or a paper loss.  If you have gains, you should take some money off of the table. If you have losses, ask yourself how you would feel if you woke up tomorrow and that money was gone. If you are truly ok with that, then by all means, ride this roller-coaster to its end, whatever that end may be. If not, however, you should really think twice about whether you are ok with that.  \n\n**THIS ISN'T FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt). THIS IS COMMON SENSE**\n\nI'm ok losing the remaining holdings i have in $GME. This is a small amount of my personal portfolio. Many on here may not be in the same position. I've read countless threads and posts of people taking their last dollar, siphoning credit cards for cash advances, taking loans on their homes...it's insane. Yes it's a unique situation, but the professional traders who have done this and do this every day, all day for years and years can act faster than you, have a strategy and have the capital to chip away at this making money regardless of what happens going forward.  \n\n**Wallstreetbets is not some magical subreddit with inside info and guaranteed path to millions** \n\nthere are some very smart people here, don't get me wrong. I've made a lot of money that i never would have had i not dug into the info that I was first exposed to here.  But, for every legitimately smart investor/trader/autist on the sub, there's a cohort of people who want nothing more than to separate others from their money and have no qualms about manipulating you and your desire for an easy win. It's human nature and it's been happening for as long as people could understand the concept of easy money.  If you've read the recent reports on Silver, that's an example of a small group of well-coordinated people taking advantage of the situation with newbies and others who may not even be on here. That said, im limiting this to $GME. \n\n**NOBODY IS GOING TO TELL YOU IT'S TIME TO SELL. THEY'LL ONLY TELL YOU WHEN YOU SHOULD HAVE SOLD**\n\nIt's easy to get everyone on board with idea to buy, and when you're being told the price can go to $10,000 (I've actually seen people legitimately saying it could go much higher), the price you buy at doesn't matter. The same cannot be said for the price at which you sell.  Reading the threads, it might feel like everyone is acting in concert, but not everyone on here is honest. Not everyone here is doing what they say they're doing. Not everyone here gives a damn about you, even if they say they do. Don't allow your confirmation bias to convince yourself to do something you know inside is a bad decision. Invest only what you can afford to lose - period. \n\n**Winning a war against Wall St. sounds great, but you really need to understand what you're up against**\n\nShares are bought and sold by professionals in fractions of a second. In the time it took you to read this, the price of GME has fluctuated by as much as $60.  Those who want to pull on your emotions are going to do whatever they can to have you focus on the Us against Them argument, but the fact of the matter is Robinhood isn't a very well capitalized organization, which is why they aren't allowing larger share purchases. Other brokers that don't have the volume that RH has had are taking orders without restriction, but that's because they have not yet hit the level of volume where their clearing capabilities and capital requirements will come into play. If everyone from RH suddenly went to WeBull  for example, you'd likely see the same thing happen there once volume in GME spiked. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBE SAFE. BE SMART. RISK ONLY WHAT YOU CAN LOSE. \n\nTL/DR: Think for yourself and make decisions based on your own risk tolerance. There are people acting in their own best interests who need you to act in a certain way in order for it to work. This is a zero-sum game. if there's going to be winners, there have to be losers.",

        "selftext": "Before going into news about short interest, I want to make clear that this data is generally not exhaustive and can never be seen as real-time. Also in light of the diversion and fake news tactics we can now observe, e. g. concerning silver, all data has to be regarded with caution.\n\nShort positions have to be filed officially but with some delay. The last official update is from January 15th, 2021 and showed around 123% of GME float shorted. In the meantime, market intelligence firms provide reports about estimated short interest, which they sell as a product along with news and analytics services. Among these firms are IHS Markit Ltd. and S3 Partners.\n\nAccording to Markit, short interest is now about 39%, S3 Partners states around 50%. Both values would be well elevated compared to the rest of the market. We also don't know to what extent these alleged numbers include new short positions at higher prices.\n\nHowever, since the enormous short percentage of GME and the extreme increase in price, it can be argued that the short squeeze is not over and will continue, if the stock price stays elevated.\n\nThe short squeeze will only be over, if the shortsellers have abandoned old positions and are comfortable in new positions, if the intend to open them.\n\nGME's stock price over time is one of the deciding factors here. If the price moves in favour of shorts still holding their positions, the may decide not to close them. If price stays elevated, additional shortsellers may need to close their positions, sending the price up.\n\nSource: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-01/gamestop-short-interest-plummets-in-a-sign-traders-are-covering](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-01/gamestop-short-interest-plummets-in-a-sign-traders-are-covering)\n\nSorry if this has been posted in the meantime. I always take my time writing posts because I crosscheck with other information sources available to me.\n\n\\#WeLikeTheStock\n\n\\#Edit 1: For anybody criticizing this post: the percentages are, regardless if the allegedly came down, extreme numbers. It is logical that the massive increase in share price came due to some positions being closed and therefore Hedge Funds suffering. But the shorts are still in and that is why they use all their foul play. Someone on here recently deducted how high the percentage of retail holders could be. It was estimated 10 shares per user. The float is only 50m. The big squeeze is not off the table. Don't jump to conclusions because my post doesn't contain rockets and so forth. The best rocket is the one in your portfolio.",

If you\u2019re questioning if something is a good opportunity, you can probably afford to wait for a better one.\n\nEdit: WHO THE FUCK GAVE ME SILVER YOU FUCKING MONSTER",

        "selftext": "Here are the main questions many have. Post will be updated with more answers and questions from the comments. This will help a lot of people!\n\n#**Q1) The short float % seems to be going down from a number of sources. Why are these not correct?**\n\nResponses:\n\n- From u/kevinjing11: Short float % is what's publicly reported. Many ways that MMs and hedge funds can essentially fake this number through unreported phantom shares\n- From u/Candle-Sticks: The short float % numbers we've been seeing are all estimates. The official reports don't come out until 2/9.\n- From u/JesusHimself69: There's no way the hedges could have paid out their shorts that fast without the stocks rocketing up. Some on Thursday/Friday? Sure. But not over the weekend. It's just a scare tactic.\n\n- From u/ whateverathrowaway00: \nhttp://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html and \nhttps://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf\nThe documents listed here show that the DTC ( central clearing house for stock trading ) has allowed counterfeit stock trading to occur for a long time. It is this environment that allows naked shorting to occur.\nThe SEC article above is from 2008 basically laying out how the restrictions put in place could be side stepped and it lines up. With this explanation, no one needed to call the DTC. There are no more shares of GME... period. That\u2019s why even though short interest is being manipulated exactly as spelled out in the SEC paper above, there are no available shares to short in most brokers. The DTC raised deposit prices. They didn\u2019t need a phone call. They\u2019re not doing it to help any brokerages or hedge funds. They\u2019re doing it to save their own ass. This is an opaque company that has the ability to shrug off congressional subpoenas. Independant actors all acting for their own gain is a much more likely explanation then widespread collusion. This is what makes sense to me. DTC raised deposits, allowing the shorts to unwind over time. The media will vilify the brokerages and hedge funds and no-one will ever ask where all the shares are. If that tactic does not work they will crash the economy in response.\n\n\n#**Q2) Can't the hedge funds just keep doing more short ladder attacks and drive the price down?**\n\nResponses: \n\n- From u/FudgieThaWhale: No, because they're losing money doing ladders in an attempt to acquire additional shares. If investors don't sell a dip then they just flat lose the money. They won't keep doing it because they can't.\n- From u/Candle-Sticks: The ladder attacks rely on the HF holding shares, they can keep selling and laddering until they run out of shares. Of course they can easily buy more at the dips they artificially create.\n- From u/storyhungry: Interactive Brokers currently says that the borrow rate is 16.97% for HFs\n\n\n#**Q3) All these hedge funds are saying they're out of their short positions to align with question #1, we obviously don't believe them and they're probably racking up a ton of fees. How long can they really last?**\n\nResponses:\n\n- From u/FudgieThaWhale: It can last as long as they want to pay margin fees. I imagine that won't be for very long.\n\n- From u/autodrafter2020: There is a massive amount of Failure to Deliver, and short sellers have to pay the clearing houses soon, it could be just days: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\n\n#**Q4) When the short squeeze happens, what period of time are we talking about? Does it last 10 mins, 2 days, etc?**\n\n\n#**Q5) How do I know if it's a short ladder attack?**\n\nResponses:\n\n- Click and read through this comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la7bhj/gme_mms_have_until_tomorrow_22_to_buy_shares_it/glmatag?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3\n\n\n#**Q6)  What % of the float do we need to own before this starts to squeeze (and is this publicly available)?**\n\nResponses: \n\n- From u/thejewsdidnothing :It is possible (and likely imo) that we already hold over 100% of GME\u2019s float. Why haven\u2019t we squeezed? Because the shorts are able to dilute the float with fake shares as much as they want. The real question that should be asked then is \u201cat what point does the government step in to stop them, or when do the shorts accrue such heavy losses that they have to cover?\u201d The answer is that we don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s only a matter of time.\n\n#**Q7)  Why can't I buy more on Vanguard (relevant to other brokers too)**\n\nResponses: \n\n- From u/Tainthairtwizzler : Vanguard no longer allowing you to use money transferred immediately. Just got off the phone with support and the funds need to be cleared through the 7 Day Hold before you can spend them. Must have been set over the weekend/today because I was able to buy BB from the same account but wasn't allowed to buy GME all during this morning.\n\n#**Q8) Isn\u2019t it plausible that HF have been shorting at 300- 400$ level and are now taking in big time on their own ladder attacks to around the 250$ level?**\n\nResponses: \n\n- From u/Thefsm93: It is possible that they have been shorting at 300-400, except that the volume of shares being traded doesn't match the volume of shares needed for the short. If the question is more geared at them buying in at 300-400 and trying to short at 250, that would just make this situation worse because they would still then need to BUY.\nPlus, why would they be artificially driving the price down with ladder attacks?\n\n#**Q9)  How does the short % of the float matter if there are approximately 10M shares to cover with?**\n\n#**Q10) (from others) I\u2019m trying to get into the gme/amc craze but public / webull apps is taking anywhere between 1-7 days to confirm deposits before i can use the funds in my bank account. is this new? is there a way to expedite the process?**\n\nResponses: \n\n- From u/waqas961: If you have a cash account linked to your bank on webull and you transfer an amount it will be available same day if did in morning or available next day as provisional funds to trade with until your actual deposit goes through which can take upto 5 days. I bought on 27th and 28th Jan but my actual deposits still show pending. Wire transfer however is different and for that you need to actually wait the whole time till it gets processed.\n- From u/sutsusame: If you want to invest money right away, see if the brokerage will let you do a wire transfer. I use E*TRADE and incoming wire transfers usually clear within minutes, with no hold period. You will probably need to pay a fee to your bank.\n\n#**Q11) What are some in depth posts that people believe should be read?**\n\nResponses: \n\n- An insane amount of deception has been in the works for a long time: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\n\n- Shit's about to get crazy: https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/\n\n- Why the squeeze hasn't happened:\n https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ladv7v/gme_will_squeeze_and_heres_the_10_reasons_why_i/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\n\n- Shorts covering:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lae73m/psa_remember_shorts_have_two_days_to_deliver_this/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\n\n\n#**Q12) I've read a couple of posts that casually mention the possibility that GameStop could issue more shares, pulling in a bunch of money and essentially letting the shorts off the hook. Can GameStop do that? If so, why the hell wouldn\u2019t they?**\n\n\n#**Q13) What happens if HFs have artificially created the counterfeit shares to the amount we hold which they exactly need and then when the short squeeze takes place, restrict all of us \ud83e\udd8d and basically resell it to themselves and make our shares burn to the ground?**\n\n\n#**Q14) What happens if the short squeeze takes place and all of the brokerage houses crash, as we have seen they have restricted us from buying? Wouldn\u2019t be surprised of seeing them not allowing us to sell at the most important moment. Btw, as we see that there is an insane amount of counterfeit shares, does that mean that this is hope they will save their asses by restricting the fake shares to be sold?**\n\n----\n\n\nI really want this to be helpful for everyone. If you are an expert or have other questions for me to ask, please comment and I will update this post. \n\nHolding 10 GME shares from $90/share. Got another one on Friday at $320 a share. I can't buy anymore but wish i could!\n\nUPDATE: Keep the responses coming please, and note: we are not financial advisors, just awesome retards!",

        "selftext": "Despite all the shit being tossed around here about silver, here is the deal.\n\nThere is a VERY real situation on the available PHYSICAL silver you can buy. The stock SLV is so trash, it doesn't even keep up with Physical silvers price.\n\nTD Precious Metals has been down for 2 days. Online stores are VERY low on stock.\n\n&gt;In response to the rapidly-evolving COVID-19 situation, the TD Precious Metals digital store is currently unavailable, but please check back later. Thank you for your patience\n\nLocally you could call up your silver dealers and a lot of them are simply NOT SELLING! It's WILD. Just think, about this idea. let it ponder. Back in the day, 1 oz of silver = 1 dollar. If 1 OZ of silver was worth even 1% of our monetary system it would equal 2 MILLION DOLLARS an OUNCE!\n\nBuying silver right now is insurance you have for THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. You really can't go wrong.\n\nIf even 6M people (IN THE WHOLE WORLD) bought 1500 worth of physical silver, the shortage would be SO GREAT, the price would increase over 1,000 / oz.\n\n[https://www.mining.com/silver-is-now-even-more-precious-than-gold-do-you-own-any/](https://www.mining.com/silver-is-now-even-more-precious-than-gold-do-you-own-any/)\n\n&gt;**Constraints in Supply**Why can\u2019t we just mine more silver? The reason we cannot \u201cfix\u201d the problem by mining more silver is the cost. Today for example, to mine gold, it takes $350 \\[to $450\\] to mine, refine, and bring to market one ounce of the yellow metal. With gold trading around \\[$1200\\] an ounce, that is a profitable endeavor. Silver however, is mined \\[primarily\\] as a by-product. In order to mine one ounce of silver as a primary metal, the cost associated with it is similar to the cost of mining one ounce of gold and with silver trading around \\[$17 \u2013 $18\\] an ounce and would not even be close to profitable when the mining costs are factored in. Currently we mine around six hundred million ounces of silver each year while industry consumes about eight hundred and seventy million ounces. Can you see a disparity developing? The market is tightening.\n\n***TL;DR Read the constraints in supply, and this -&gt; 130% of YEARLY silver harvested, is used in Industry!!***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/silver-retail-sites-grind-halt-190456039.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/silver-retail-sites-grind-halt-190456039.html)\n\nNOT A RED HEARRING BOYS.

        "selftext": "**EDIT 2: INCASE NOT CLEAR FROM THE BELOW I CLEARLY THINK THIS IS A GOOD SPAC AND HAVE A POSITION.** \n\n**Hello All!**\n\nHere to talk about a SPAC that's really underappreciated. **TPG Pace Tech Opportunities Corp. (PACE)** has recently announced a definitive agreement to merge with Nerdy and is currently trading at $10.88.\n\nLearning is critical, as evidenced by the fools that shorted a stock by over140% the world is clearly not receiving the education it needs.\n\nSo it's time for a deep dive.\n\n**Website (investor page):** [Investors \u2014 Nerdy](https://www.nerdy.com/investors) (investor presentation can be accessed here and there is a nice video)\n\n**Learning platform:** [Online Tutoring, Classes, and Test Prep - Varsity Tutors](https://www.varsitytutors.com/) (note you can be taken to this page if you go to the Nerdy website an click learning platform.\n\n**Investor Presentation Key Takeaways:**\n\nExisting Nerdy Investors consist of a group of investors that hit homeruns out of the park, these are:\n\n* **TCV:** early stage investors in AIRBNB, PELOTON, SPOTIFY, ZILLOW and NETFLIX. They have been right 5 times, I expect they are right again with Nerdy.\n* **Learn capital:** they have invested across top learning platforms, Udemy, Coursera &amp; VIPKID. They know the market.\n* **Zuckerberg:** I assume you have heard of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp?\n\nLets looks into the financials next:\n\n* **Earnings growth historic:** Q4-20E year on year revenue growth of 87%, this may have been influenced by lockdown but nonetheless is truly remarkable.\n* **Paid online session growth**: +169% as this service grows faster it will pull up the overall revenue growth.\n* **Projected compound annual growth rate (forecasted revenue growth):** 45%\n* **Total addressable market:** $1.3 trillion offline direct to consumer market is expected to move online quickly. In my view online learning can provide higher quality learning at a lower cost at a time more suitable to students.  The shift to online learning is inevitable and catalysts such as the pandemic and the emergence of reliable technologies such as zoom will continue to accelerate this trend.\n\n**The product:** why is it superior Cal? I hear you ask.\n\nVarsity Tutors, Nerdy's client facing platform current has provided 4.7m+ hours of live instruction hours in 2020 alone with a service offering of over 3000 subjects. It's legacy businesses include Veritas Prep and First Tutors (a UK business). Service offerings include: one-on-one, adaptive self study, small group classes and large group classes. This swath of subjects means Nerdy is providing everything that the market could possibly demand.\n\nAritficial intelligence. Nerdy uses AI to insure that the best experts are identified for each respective student, this is done based on earning from last interactions in order to identify critical traits etc. This key feature will make the platform extensively more sticky with users and make it harder for competitors to move in. Essentially providing a MOAT.\n\nThe user interface is slick (see examples on website or page 23 of investor presentation), it provides 2 ways video calls with a slide for learners to interact on either through drawing, pointing, typing etc. Hence providing both tutors and students to interact however works best for them.\n\nConsumer scores of 68 echo my sentiment above with Netflix having a matching score and only AirBnB having a better score.\n\n**Growth Vectors:**\n\nThere are numerous growth vectors to consider:\n\n* **Subject expansion:** new subjects can attract additional students or be provided to existing students who like the platform.\n* **Professional:** professional qualification training such as the CPA, ACCA, CFA etc costs $1000s and can easily be provided on the Nerdy playform;\n* **Format expansion:** varying formats from larger classes to more self study options can be added;\n* **International:** there is a whole world of learners out there with huge swathes not having access to affordable adequate education. A budget large classroom option would be perfect for these less well off countries.\n* **M&amp;A:** with the businesses expertise in learning and understanding of the market they can use the funds from the deal to acquire competitors. Existing investors like Mark Zuckeberg are familiar with this strategy, see his acquisition of Facebook competitors Instagram and Whatsapp.\n\n**Valuations / Comparables (see slides 43 and 44 of investor presentation):**\n\nNerdy is expected to grow at a rate (see above) twice as fast as its competitor CHEGG (forecast 20%). As well as faster than similar online businesses. With a basket of Chegg, Fiverr, Airbnb, doordash, Etsy, MatchGroup and Teladoc all forecasting an average 26% revenue growth and gross margin of 72%.\n\nNerdy is valued at a 7.1x multiple of forecasted 2022 revenue compared to an average multiple of 16.9x for the aforementioned comparables. Of note Fiverr and AirBnB trade at multiples of 24.7x and 22.5x. I however feel Teladoc health with its online one to one Doctor interaction presents the most similar business model, Teladoc trade at a multiple of 16.4x. Should Nerdy trade at such a multiple than the SP will be greater than 20.4. I believe this presents a reasonable price target noting that Nerdy is growing at a faster rate.\n\n**Possible catalysts:**\n\nThe main issue with a business like this from an investor perspective is that the public may not appreciate its appeal and potential. However, I see Nerdy as highly likely Cathie Wood pickup given its similar operating model to Teladoc, a business she has been investing in heavily. Should Cathie Wood invest then I expect to see a very large following.\n\nAdditionally, the investment by Zuckerberg could also draw attention to the stock\n\nEdit: current positions include, FTOC, FUSE, CCIV, ALUS and PACE.

        "selftext": "\\*\\*\\* Because several people have misunderstood this: OAC reached $18 in on January 14th -- before Cathie was in the picture at all (ARKK added OAC at the end of January). \\*\\*\\*\n\nOn the day of the DA with Hims, OAC dropped 8% to $10.8. Most dismissed Hims as a 'dick pill company' and/or claimed that the valuation was too high, which was quite ironic given that many of these same people thought EV SPACs were a buy at much higher valuations. If people had read the investor presentation and looked into the backgrounds of the Oaktree team, it'd have been patent that this was a tier-1 sponsor that struck a deal with a high-caliber company with substantial revenue and revenue growth as well as gross margins -- and at a compelling valuation.\n\nYet the proceeding weeks OAC bled to *below* trust ($10 at one point) and the warrants dropped to $1.4. I was an early believer in Hims, but my confidence was shaken a bit by this all (at one point I was down 40K on my position) . So I did not double down like I should have, though I didn't jump ship either thankfully.\n\nWhat caused this all and prevented so many from taking advantage of an incredible opportunity? Too few people did their own research or went against the crowd that hastily dismissed Hims/OAC. If you had done so, you would have made a *literally risk free* 80% return on the common shares (which got to $18 pre-merger) and a relatively low risk (for warrants) 680%+ gain on the warrants if you held through the merger. Instead, people were buying CIIC at $30 and SBE at $40 because of the hype surrounding them.\n\nThis is why we should think for ourselves and sometimes go against the crowd. If this were more common practice, the SPAC space would be much healthier and more sustainable. My conclusion: The herd mentality that prevails in SPAC land can be greatly frustrating at times. But it can also make for fantastic buying opportunities for those who dig deeper and go against the grain.\n\nThe SPAC market is so hot right now that I doubt there are many -- but if anyone can think of a similar mispricing in the SPAC market at the moment, I'd be interested to hear your reasoning!",

        "selftext": "Preface: BUY GME DONT SELL HOLD AND FUCK CITADEL.\n\nI am not preaching for people to buy into paper silver stocks. The criticism that the market is too big to be influenced is correct. There are way more paper silver shares in circulation than there is physical silver to back it up.   \n\n\nI hope you all realize that the Hedgies understand that this sub will have an adverse reaction to anything they do to try and move people off of GME. They understand that promoting silver will get the reaction that it currently is: people saying that silver is a trick and to forget about it. \n\nPaper silver shares are not the move, obviously, but Silver still has the potential to be the next big move if we approach it correctly. EMPHASIS ON NEXT\\* DO NOT SELL GME OR MOVE INTO THIS POSITION UNTIL THIS WAR IS OVER.\n\nIf people start buying physical silver and demanding delivery of their paper shares, it will result in devastation for the Hedgies and Big Banks. This is why they are pushing paper shares so hard to get WSBs to call off the dogs on silver all together. Don't underestimate your enemy, they understand what reactions their actions will get.   \n\n\nSilver can be the bullet that pops the everything bubble, but it needs to be done in a specific way. If the tutes that are trading all these paper shares that represent far more silver than actually physically exists, then demanding delivery will force them to pay any price to get the material. If the retail market is buying up that physical stock before that happens, they are fucked,   \n\n\nThis is still the long play imo, but I have been in this space for many many years. It is a solid investment regardless of what the outcome is in terms of damage to the tutes. It could be the best next move in this war, but we will see. I am long silver, but I am a physical collector. I think the anti silver hype that has gained traction here is exactly what they are after.   \n\n\nMy suggestion is that we just ignore silver all together for now, but don't forget about it when the GME stage finally resolves. That is what they want. Let's win this GME short squeeze before we promote any other moves, but be extra vigilant of any moves they are making through their media cronies. They are learning what their actions result in, and they will use that to manipulate you away from the things they don't want you focusing on. I truly believe this is a fake out, and we are giving them the reaction they desire by killing any and all moves into the PM space.   \n\n\nThats just my opinion though. Do as you see fit.

        "selftext": "I opened a fidelity account and transferred money into an account. Enough for 6 shares of GME. \n\nI purchased it this morning via the active trader pro application, and it just said error.

        "selftext": "Something to think about. Over 30% of GME sales were online last quarter, Ryan Cohen is trying to pivot to ecommerce which trades on the stockmarket at many higher multiples on revenues than retail orientated businesses. \n\n\nGamestop is going to be frothing at the mouth to do some kind of capital raise with stocks at these prices, be it to shorts, banks, issuing shares, etc. This isn't a bad thing, it takes the pump and dump risk out of the equation and sets a fundamental floor. If they had 5 billion sitting in the war chest, just based on the cash alone the floor would be set at the 150-200$ mark, let alone the trading multiples seen for ecommerce focused companies compared to the really low multiples that retail businesses have been getting the past few years (and even worse with covid now).\nWith literally billions in cash, they could aggressively grow into ecommerce / online markets. \n\n\nThere could be talks with the short hedge funds to just do a big deal that lets them off the hook without going bankrupt. 300$ a share for 20 million shares, would be 6 BILLION$ IN CASH!!!!!!!! That's #%!@#$ing insane man, like literally insane.  They could go on a  buying spree with sexy emerging businesses, the possibilities are actually pretty wild. Not to mention the floor would be set in the 250-350 range once things equalize.   The short interest after that would still be VERY high, and it would be an unbelievably small dilution to raise that amount of cash.  Now the shorts left over are in a new precarious situation, where GME is an entirely different company with the chance for explosive growth, backed by cash, and it would be a fundamentally different company they were betting against with the chance to grow far higher than the current 250-350$ range seen in the last week. \n\n\nI mean ultimately who knows how this all unfolds lol, but I think this was a saving grace for gamestop and it is not going to look like the business we knew 5 years ago moving forward.  They could go global, tap into way different international online markets, do some cool things with digital sales / esports. Just straight up buy a bunch of incredibly profitable companies that synergize with ecommerce. The options would be limitless for them. \n\n\nI mean christ, the sheer name exposure they got in 5 days, that's easily worth like a billion dollars in advertising. I don't think there is a person on the world with internet access who hasn't heard of gamestop now. \n\n\nEveryone here is thinking this will be a pump and dump squeeze, with a straight up singular parabolic move and then straight down... but I think there is a potential if they can raise significant cash from desperate shorts, this just becomes a long hold with cash raises and a fundamental restructuring of the business model from here on out. Will be interesting to see what gamestop is up to 3-5 years from now when this all settles.\n\n\n\n\nEdit TLDR (Since people replying obviously didn't read my post lol):  If gamestop can raise 6 billion $ in cash at these levels, it changes everything for the company including it's longterm prospects, floor valuation, and opportunity for growth. \n\n\nYES GAMESTOP IS OVERVALUED RIGHT NOW, BUT NOT IF THEY RAISE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN CASH BY ISSUING A RELATIVELY SMALL AMOUNT OF SHARES.

        "selftext": "Preface: Everyone hates GME thoughts that appear negative, if you hate this I get it. This is not meant as a negative scare tactic but only a potential hypothesis of what may occur.\n\n1. GameStop has the ability to raise a secondary offering by issuing more shares into either the public or private markets. Technically, they can issue 300 million shares. Here is an SEC Filing from 2005 [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000119312513364182/d569889dex31.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000119312513364182/d569889dex31.htm)\n2. Even if the above SEC filing did not exist they would probably structure something to allow a secondary offering as the market has given them a second lifeline ( Just 1 year ago they were a company worth $200m today they are worth 100x that).\n3. It is highly unlikely that GameStop will issue 300 million shares or even 100 million shares\n4. I believe it is realistic to think that they may raise $1-2 Billion in a secondary offering probably some portion of debt and equity (not just flooding the market).\n5. They could do this by either offering a non-dilutive secondary offering by selling their shares they currently hold, or by causing a dilution event and issuing more shares\n6. In a dilution event this would look like adding 10% of shares to the market which will have some impact but doubt it will crater the stock.\n7. Google raised about $4 Billion through something similar in 2005 [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondaryoffering.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondaryoffering.asp)\n8. In some ways it would be foolish for the company not to take advantage of the current situation and raise some amounts of additional capital.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: GameStop will likely do a secondary offering but it will be unlikely flood the market with 300 million shares.\n\nThese are just my best guesses not facts.",

Sure you can say pre 1998 there was some red years in there, but that was also before the iphone, ipads, and the tech boom...what am I missing here? I am not talking 100k, I am just sayin, if I have 5-7k I can invest...I could put in the SP and watch it double every decade....orrrrrr I could put it in apple and watch it quadruple? Obviously with a risk of one stock, you never know...but I guess my point of this is why does everyone say you can't beat the SP? Is that looking at 100 years of data, or what?",

        "selftext": "Good morning autists! Due to the large influx of new users, I think it's a good idea to go over a *very* important aspect of trading -- taxes.\n\nNow, there have been multitudes of sick gains posted over the past weeks. You may be thinking of dropping yours on a new Lambo, and rightly so, but before you do, make sure you determine how deep the Tax Man is going to have his hand in your pockets come next year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Capital Gains\n\nA Capital gain is exactly what you should expect: a gain realized from trading something of value. When you bought 1 GME share for $20 and sold for $500, you realized a $480 capital gain.\n\nCapital gains are taxed through two different schedules in the U.S.: Long-term Capital Gains tax and Short-term Capital Gains tax. Again, as you might suspect, these taxes are applied based on how long you held the capital. **To qualify for the long-term capital gains tax, you must hold the capital for more than one year**. Everything else is taxed as short-term.\n\nNote that this only applies to those without \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50, as you are only taxed on gains made from closing a position (*realized* gains).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Long-term Capital Gains\n\nNow, if you saw the original comment by our lord and savior u/DeepFuckingValue and jumped in at the same time, you would qualify for the long-term capital gains tax:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|$ Amount|Tax Rate|\n|:-|:-|\n|$0 - $40,000|0%|\n| $40,000 - $441,450 |15%|\n| $441,450 - \u221e |20%|\n\nThe brackets above represent taxation on a Single taxpayer. [You can find the brackets for Married (filing jointly or separately) and Head of Household here.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/101515/comparing-longterm-vs-shortterm-capital-gain-tax-rates.asp)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Short-term Capital Gains\n\nI would imagine that most of you did *not* jump in with DFV over a year ago, and thus are subject to the short-term capital gains tax. Short term capital gains are taxed as regular income, meaning that it is summed with any additional income you make throughout the year at a regular job.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|$ Amount|Tax Rate|\n|:-|:-|\n| 0 - $9,875 |10%|\n| $9,876 - $40,125 |12%|\n| $40,126 - $85,525 |22%|\n| $85,526 - $163,300 |24%|\n| $163,301 - $207,350 |32%|\n| $207,351 - $518,400 |35%|\n| $518,400 - \u221e|37%|\n\nThe brackets above represent taxation on a Single taxpayer. [You can find the brackets for Married (filing jointly or separately) and Head of Household here.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/101515/comparing-longterm-vs-shortterm-capital-gain-tax-rates.asp)\n\nThere is a caveat to the tax brackets above -- Federal income tax is applied at a *progressive rate*. \n\nIf you make $100,000 at your job this year and a $70,000 short-term gain with GME, you might expect to pay a 32% tax and owe $54,400. However, you actually would only owe $35,415.50. \n\nThe progressive rate schedule means that the first $9,875 you earn is taxed at 10%, then the next $30,249 ($40,125 - the $9876 which was already taxed at 10%) is taxed at 12%, then the next $45,399 is taxed at 22%, and so on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can see, it is much more tax advantageous to hold. Even the federal government wants you to hold. **SO HOLD.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a tax professional. This only applies to U.S. residents. The information herein is only in respect to **Federal** tax. There may or may not be state-specific tax as well. There are *many* other factors that may increase or decrease your taxable income. Certain equities/equity derivatives are taxed differently than stated above. If you made bank over the past few weeks, **TALK TO A CPA**. My limited knowledge of tax law could be wrong -- if you see a mistake, leave a comment and I will correct it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**tl;dr:** [Ben Franklin once wrote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_and_taxes_(idiom)) that in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except **death and taxes.** Do not spend all of your gains without accounting for taxes. The tax man *will* have you pay in some form or fashion; whether it's in cash, repossession, wage garnishment, or jail is up to you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Sources:\n\n[Investopedia: Understanding Long-Term vs. Short-Term Capital Gains](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/101515/comparing-longterm-vs-shortterm-capital-gain-tax-rates.asp)\n\n[IRS: Capital Gains Tax Rates](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc409)\n\n[IRS: RP-19-44 (Income Tax)](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rp-19-44.pdf)",

        "selftext": "Hi guys, I been looking for a good stock under the radar and managed to find one finally\n\nI will be talking about $INKW (Greene Concepts)\n\nThe company came back to life because of their new product BeWater and they are looking really good and have a strong future ahead.\n\nLet's get straight to the facts.\n\n\\- CEO is talking about listing in the NASDAQ and has a future in being in the NASDAQ. They have already 4m in assets which is a requirement for the NASDAQ. I don't think I have seen any CEO's of any penny stock companies talking about listing in NASDAQ this early so this is a good sign to me.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/greene-concepts-prepared-rise-steadily-152500531.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/greene-concepts-prepared-rise-steadily-152500531.html)\n\n\\-2 months ago they restructured their share structure. They retired 285 million shares from their OS. Now why would a company that is just getting started do that? Think guys.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/greene-concepts-announces-284-million-150100223.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/greene-concepts-announces-284-million-150100223.html)\n\n\\- They got into amazon and sold out in less than a hour. They are also looking to expand into Walmart and global markets which is a very very strong sign imo.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/greene-concepts-water-product-online-145400843.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/greene-concepts-water-product-online-145400843.html)\n\namazon listing - [https://www.amazon.com/Artesian-Natural-Alkaline-Artisanal-Springs/dp/B08QF9CB9L/ref=sr\\_1\\_6?dchild=1&amp;keywords=be+water+artesian&amp;qid=1611925054&amp;sr=8-6](https://www.amazon.com/Artesian-Natural-Alkaline-Artisanal-Springs/dp/B08QF9CB9L/ref=sr_1_6?dchild=1&amp;keywords=be+water+artesian&amp;qid=1611925054&amp;sr=8-6)\n\nrestocking amazon inventory - [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/consumer-demand-high-greene-concepts-145400877.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/consumer-demand-high-greene-concepts-145400877.html)\n\nThere is also very strong buys indicator from different analysts from what I can find online.\n\n[https://otcbb.swingtradebot.com/equities/INKW:OTC](https://otcbb.swingtradebot.com/equities/INKW:OTC)\n\n\\- this is a example, don't want to link every site\n\nAlso in between the lines of one of the news article the CEO states \"  This is just the beginning of many wonderful things to come and I would like to thank Amazon for helping us get this wonderful product to the masses. This is an immensely powerful step in our quest to reach NASDAQ and continual incremental growth as a company\". So my question is not only are they releasing water will they be coming out with new products? And after the performance of the opening day of BeWater, I wonder how strong the new products will be.\n\nI think this stock will get the attention it deserves when earnings report is out because a stock evaluated at 0.015 right now with this strong of a profile is really rare.\n\nMy opinion on the CEO - I also strongly believe in this company because of the CEO. I like how he talks about his vision and his plans months before he does it. He claimed to moving into amazon 3 months ago and as soon as he puts his product on amazon, it sells out in less than a hour. Keep in mind this was the #1 new best seller in mineral water when it came out.\n\nVideo on why you should hold the stock- \n\nhttps://youtube.com/watch?v=ByDuChGGIzM&amp;feature=share",

Here\u2019s why I am long the sector and eyeing options..\n\nLast week, Chuck Schumer accounced that Marijuana Reform Bills are being merged as Congress moves to legalize.\n\nThis is massive news, in fact, Stifel is calling this a Goldilocks Scenario for companies like Tilray.\n\n&gt;This could potentially foreshadow the most significant catalyst in the history of the U.S. cannabis industry\n\nThe ~~Roaring~~ Rolling 2020s 'Will Be Fueled By Weed' As Cannabis Experts Predict Regulatory Shakeups In 2021\n\n&gt;2021 should be a year of ongoing regulatory movement; expecting 2022 to mark the biggest wave the reform movement has seen so far\n\nThe marijuana industry is a beaten down industry with banking restrictions &amp;amp; short interest through the roof. \n\nUS Legalization is just around the corner and no one is talking about it. \n\nI strongly encourage everyone to research some companies and potentially get in before the media gets ahold of this story.\n\nHere are a list of cannabis related companies you can look into with options:\n\nAphria, Tilray, Canopy Growth, Organigram, Aurora, HEXO\n\n(Many MSOs still trade on the OTC, but will be pushing to uplist in the near future. Keep an eye on Curaleaf, Trulieve, Cresco Labs &amp; Green Thumb)\n\nThere are also ETFs available with US exposure such as $MSOS\n\nAlso, it is important to deepdive the management in this industry, as it is with any other. A good management with tegrity goes a long way. I won\u2019t go into detail, but, we\u2019ve seen behind some curtains(walls) and it wasn\u2019t pretty.\n\nPolitico said \u2018There\u2019s no stopping the industry now\u2019: Democratic control is a big win for marijuana \n\nStay safe &amp; GLTA!\n\nI am eyeing APHA 1/20/23 20 Cs @ 4.20 (currently long)\n\nCheck out that bullflag forming on the monthly.\n\nEdit: Here\u2019s a list of other cannabis related companies...

        "selftext": "**Stocks end their worst week since October at their lowest point on Friday. Is the Short-Squeeze Over? Over 100 companies report earnings this week. Let\u2019s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of Friday as we saw the stock market finish with another sell-off, as the big 3 indices finished with the worst week since late October with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Vpq92y3) losing almost 2%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/yN3b3RQ) losing exactly 2% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/D7Cy2YQ) shedding 620 points and dropping below 30k. All 3 of them finished the week down more than 3% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/cgz4N3r) spiked yet again on Friday, rising by almost 10% and finishing the week up more than 40%.\n\nWe saw over 70% of the companies declining [Friday](https://ibb.co/G3rX22D), as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average dropped under 50%, with all 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/HKhY6hC) finishing in the red again, as Energy &amp; Tech were the biggest losers. \n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/jVFqVbH). It\u2019s really hard to find any gaining companies, with big tech companies selling off yet again, as most of the small gainers were found in the Health Care sector. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/5Y5HR4q)  though, Microsoft was the only big tech name that managed to gain ground after smashing the earnings report, while most of the stock market faced sell-off pressures as the short squeeze mania might have pushed investors into a risk-off approach.\n\nWe also got some economic data on Friday as the December personal disposable [INCOME](https://ibb.co/Khyh7mP) increase by 0.6%, more than expected as this mostly reflected an increase in social benefits &amp; compensations, with the Q4 employment cost [INDEX](https://ibb.co/QcqbM5y) also rising by 0.7% to close out the year.\n\nMeanwhile we saw the Consumer Sentiment [INDEX](https://ibb.co/pX3mFgt) coming in at 79, slightly lower than expected, as this was also seen in the December pending home sales [NUMBER](https://ibb.co/m4tbnWN), which also came in with a 0.3% decrease month/month.\n\nThis week we have somewhat of a quiet economic [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v), with a couple of interesting numbers through the week, while [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/rxmpwVK) take center stage yet again, with interesting reports coming from companies like Amazon, Google &amp; Alibaba on Tuesday, while Wednesday we hear from PayPal, Qualcomm &amp; Spotify. We also get earnings reports from some recent favorites like Pinterest, Snap, Ford, Peloton and Penn on Thursday as the earnings season with over 100 companies from the SP500 reporting, might help push the stock market higher after the sell-off last week.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/C0CSdJJ) reporting a new monthly record with 7225 vehicles delivered in the first month of 2021\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80, an increase of more than 350% Y/Y as the company is still ramping up production in an attempt to challenge Tesla\u2019s EV dominance. Nio has had a huge run in the past months but has a long way to go to grow into the big valuation, though the trajectory of the company looks very promising.\n\nMeanwhile the biggest development in the markets was the trading platforms [imposing](https://ibb.co/y5sPVJv) restrictions on the squeezed stocks and even many other stocks that didn\u2019t have such a big short % of the float with big names like AMD, Starbucks &amp; Moderna being affected. These restrictions were reduced back to only 8 companies [Sunday](https://ibb.co/GV5TKxf), but are still limited to whole share aggregate buy limits on the crowd favorites\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.\n\nThe recent moves in the stock market have made some big changes in the social world as Steve Cohen deactivate his [Twitter](https://ibb.co/0KK2P59) \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80, while a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/Mf6V8tz) showed that more than \u00be of respondents are planning on leaving RBNHD while 13% already did it, with the limiting tactics being probably the biggest reason for retail investors to make this change.\n\nInteractive [Brokers](https://ibb.co/JzR5qCC) also re-opened trading on these names on Sunday, which brings to question if these platforms have insider knowledge of the future of the stocks, or did they just increased their liquidity just like [RBNHD](https://ibb.co/P6WXwDj) after they raised more than $1B earlier in the week.\n\nSo\u2026 I think the stock market is still very volatile and the short squeezes can keep on going for an unknown period of time as markets can act in an unusual pattern for longer than anyone can anticipate, or the short squeeze can vanish in a second\u2026 this one is very hard to predict\u2026 Yes, keep the pedal to the medal in the hot stocks\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 but also stay invested in great companies as good earnings reports haven\u2019t helped most stocks again this quarter, but may provide good buying opportunities for the long-term.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nAnd finally, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wc2P16r) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way as we await to see the Manufacturing Indexes numbers in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v).\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "First of all, I can't wait to be berated in the comments. \n\nI'm gonna be blunt, I have seen a whole lot of dumb shit over the last week.  A lot more than normal.  And compounding all of that is an unprecedented amount of legitimate emotional involvement here.  So let me get started by saying outright that people getting emotionally involved with trading stocks always lose.  Short, long, whatever.  It doesn't matter if you're a 19 year old throwing in your life savings or Bill fucking Ackman not being able to admit he was wrong with Herbalife.  Letting your emotions be a major factor in trading is a fantastic way to lose money. \n\nAnd a whole lot of you are really emotionally involved with this GME, AMC, whatever.\n\nTo the point: I am not making a buy/sell/hold/whatever recommendation.  I have no special insight in to what's happening with GME or whatever else.  What I can tell you is that it is for sure not worth $300.\n\nSo let's dispel one quick thing: this is not David vs Goliath.  It also isn't the little man vs hedge funds or WSB vs big finance.  It might have started out that way, but if you only read one thing [read this](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-29/reddit-traders-on-robinhood-are-on-both-sides-of-gamestop): \n\n&gt;Many of the big retail brokerages, including Robinhood, route a lot of their customer orders to Citadel Securities, so it ends up seeing a large percentage of retail trades in U.S. stocks. It can see if retail traders are mostly buying or mostly selling or mostly pretty balanced. You might expect\u2014I certainly expected\u2014to see that retail traders were buying more than they were selling this week. The stock seemed to be rocketing up on frenzied retail sentiment, and the posters on WallStreetBets were all claiming that they would never sell and keep buying until it hit $1,000.\n\n&gt;But here\u2019s what Citadel Securities\u2019 retail flow looked like in GameStop this week: 1\n\n&gt;[Graphic here](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i9SnRzR8AM1c/v0/800x-1.png)\n\n\n&gt;Retail investors were net buyers on Monday but net sellers for the rest of the week (through yesterday), and all in all quite balanced: About 49.8% of retail orders (that Citadel Securities saw) were to buy, and 50.2% were to sell.\n\n&gt;What do you make of that? One reading would be: \u201cRetail investors on Reddit might have started the GameStop rally, but they\u2019re not piling into this stock now, and the price action this week is coming from professionals.\u201d Or as one Twitter user put it, \u201cpast the retail ignition, the rocket ship was mostly intra-fast money warfare.\u201d\n\n\n\nSo, just to be clear about this, there is massive institutional money on both sides of this trade, and retail is a toddler sitting at the world series of poker.  \n\n**Understand that melvin does not need to cover in the way a retail trader needs to cover**.  \nYou, and everyone else, have no idea what Melvin's position looks like, and they can reorganize and exit a position before you ever knew it happened.  You don't know how hedged they are, you don't know what their collateral looks like, and you don't know if they've covered and restructured a short at last week's prices.  You simply don't know.  You only know what's been presented in the news, which is almost certainly bullshit.  \n\nThis thing could come to an end as fast as it started and you won't know what happened for weeks.  You might go take a shit at 1pm today and come back to GME trading at $16 because Ken Griffin got on CNBC and announced they restructured their short at an average price of $200, and were happy to sit on it.  Make no mistake, you'll get kicked in the nuts and have your ball taken away faster than you can comprehend.    \n\n**Emotions**\nThe problem with this whole \"strike back at wall street\" narrative is that lots of you are getting really worked up over this trade.  Losing money sucks, but losing money and feeling like you got shit on by the big guy is going to hurt.  This isn't a moral crusade to them, it's 25 billion dollars.  So if you're out here putting money and emotions on the line that you can't afford to lose there won't be a happy ending. \n\nWant to fight the good fight against wall street? Write your congressman, Tweet AOC or Ted Cruz, get you a fucking picket sign and go wave it around on the streeet.  But dropping money on GME that you need in life ain't gonna change anything except your net worth.\n\nTLDR: \n\n1) know and understand who is playing this game.  And that they have access to tools, leverage, and markets that you do not.  You're playing Le Chiffre at Casino Royale right now, you might think you're James Bond but there's a good chance that you're just the fat dude in the corner. \n\n2) Short squeezes end fast.  As fast as they started.  If you're new to trading then understand buying GME at this price can mean all of your money will evaporate before you had time to make a TikTock about it.\n\n3) Get your emotions out of play here.  This whole nonsense political narrative is only going to cause you to make trading mistakes.  Can't handle that?  then maybe it's not a good idea to sit at this table.  \n\nLastly, if you really just can't get yourself out of the whole \"fight the hedge funds\" nonsense, at least understand that you're spending money that you likely won't get back.  If that's worth it to you then have at it.  But don't fool yourself  in to thinking otherwise.\n\n**E: Completely unrelated**: I hate reddit awards, reddit doesn't need your money.  Go buy like a hundredth of a share of VTI or something.",

In 1980, a rule change by the government destroyed the corner.  #silverthursday.\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday\n\n&gt;Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers\u2019 attempt to corner the market on the metal.\n\n-\n&gt;Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926\u20132014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers\u2019 Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.\n\n-\n&gt;By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged\u2014March 27\u2014silver fell to $10.80, the metal\u2019s biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, \u201cA billion dollars isn\u2019t what it used to be,\u201d the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.\n\n-\n&gt;To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978\u201391) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.",

        "selftext": "We\u2019re not. Plain and simple. Anyone who frequents WSB knows this. \n\nThis means whatever media source is indicating this to be the case is a sellout and their credibility should be in serious question since they either 1) don\u2019t do their due diligence, or 2) are okay with getting their strings pulled to be used as tools by the wealthy to manipulate masses.\n\nIf there was any doubt of these hedge fund\u2019s influence and manipulate, this whole \u201cWSB going silver\u201d just put that conspiracy theory to rest and only does more to confirm that the game has always been rigged against the average person.\n\n\n\n**Edit:** You know what would be AMAZING?? This was an idea already thrown out there, but if the mods could use twitter (and by pinning a statement on this subreddit) to invalidate the silver BS... That would be SUCH a great fucking move. Maybe a message like **\"There is no sentiment among WSB members to buy SLV stock and the little that exists is under scrutiny of WSB members\"**. That would just slam the door on any sources propagating that false information and call them out on their BS (because it's just so obviously untrue). It would also make it clear for those checking the credibility of this fake news that the silver hype is a fabrication by variables outside of WSB and inform them of how convenient it is for hedge funds if people pulled from GME, and supported a stock they own massive shares of.\n\nThis goes without saying that I'm holding GME till the very end. Given how the media and some brokerages have gotten involved (and in a not so subtle way that benefits the hedge funds), it's not even about the money anymore. And that's coming from someone with student loans who stands to profit by exiting right now. Money comes and goes, but getting to witness firsthand just how rigged the system is and knowing **who's** involved in keeping people in line is just something you can't put a price tag on.",

        "selftext": "# Remember hedge funds have the weak hand\n\nThey had to realise gains from other investments just to cover losses from GME. Thursday and Friday were the days with the biggest deleveraging sisnce March 2020. Each day they have to pay high interest just to mantain the short positions, and you know what? Every time they realise gains to cover losses their performance gets worse, and this makes them look like idiots in front of their clients, putting their business in danger.\n\n# Expect some crazy volatility\n\nRemember you are playing against hedge funds, they are not going to give you free money. There is no free money in the stock market. GME investors hit them hardly, and for them is not just about losses but they have to proof to their clients that they cannot be beaten by a bunch of redditors. They may suppress the price or manipulate it. There are some excellent posts on this sub about how they manipulate the stock price (ladder attacks, MSM misinformation, etc).\n\n# Manage your risk\n\nI hold GME since $20s. For me right now there is no risk in holding the stock because it will never go back to that level. If you just bought at $300 have in mind they may be able to supress the price for days or weeks to $100-$200 level, so you must be able to stomach this volatility. I would recommend only investing money you can afford to lose to not panic sell if you see this wild volatily.\n\nThe important thing as an investor is to hold, more than to buy like crazy.\n\n# Be a critical thinker, do your DD\n\nThere is nothing that the MSM wishes more than to see loss porn from retail investors to say \"see, they didn't know what they were doing\". Please, don't give them the opportunity to say that.\n\nDo your DD, check user history whenever you read something to make sure users are no hedge fund trolls. Hedge funds are now trying to focus you attention on everything except GME. The Silver play is a trap. Citadel is long silver. \n\n# BEWARE THAT IF YOU BUY SILVER, you are helping Citadel to cover losses with their gains and give them the chance to fight on GME.\n\nMaybe mods should ban silver posts as lots of people could potentially lose money on that play.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR:\n\nDO YOUR OWN DD. BE CRITICAL.\n\nHOLD. THEY HAVE THE WEAK HAND, NOT YOU.\n\nBEWARE OF SILVER.\n\nFor SEC minions reading this: this is not investment advice.\n\nEdit 1: many thanks for the awards guys.\n\nEdit 2: WSJ and Bloomberg are pushing the silver narrative and creating the impression that somehow people here are coordinated which is complete false. Also Citadel is long silver and it seems posts are being created mainly by bots. I definitely think mods should take action.\n\nEdit 3: about silver, it is not my call, I am just sharing my point of view, I totally get the people who says nothing should be banned. Just have in mind MSM are depicting WSB as a group of organized investors that are colluding to target different assets, which is completely false. Should their message gets acceptance because of SLV they could try to ban this sub. So I think mods should at least check if those posts are legit, and if they comply with the rules. Nothing else.",

So fucking brilliant that I'm willing to give him my entire 401k to make this happen.\n\nGameStop is no longer a retailer, it is a viral company. We need to value it like a viral company. Look at Dollar Shave Club. (Almost) everyone buys razors and doesn't give a shit where they come from. But DSC changed everything. People WANTED to buy razors from DSC. I believe we will WANT to buy from GameStop. Fuck, I love this company (and stock) so much, if GameStop starts selling razors, I will buy them.\n\nDollar Shave Club was sold to Unilever for $1billion when sales were around $100million ($200million projected). I believe GameStop has more value. They are going to increase sales 3x or 4x. They will increase their online presence and start selling more products. This is going to be huge. My valuation of GameStop is 15x current sales, or $1,398.85 per share and my target price is $2,797.70 within 2 years. \n\nThe short squeeze will push this stock even higher, but for the long term the current price is a bargain.\n\nI'M HOLDING THIS STOCK!\n\nI know GameStop is a good retail company and I'm confident they will grow after this, but it is also personal. The criminals who paused my trades need to go to jail. When they get out, I want them to see a fucking GameStop store everywhere they go. Every shopping center, every mall, fucking everywhere!

I'm a pants-on-head wearing retard and have possibly missed key points that would contradict my statements. Invest at your own risk.**\n\n**And yes, I own GME.**\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs we've been seeing this weekend, multiple bots have been hard pushing silver. At almost exactly the same time as this happened (EOD Friday) it was announced that SLV and futures were rising rapidly due to the 'Reddit mob' even though the vast majority of retail has no way to trade on weekends or touch futures.\n\nThis is obviously because no one has jumped on silver. Or at least not retail. The banks sure do love silver, and so do the boys at Shitadel. Shitadel is the fifth largest holder, along with several large banks.\n\n**Their strategy is probably something like this:**\n\nThey are running out of ammunition and their investors are scared. They love to hedge with commodities, and because they and their investors are scared now is the time to stock up. They've bought out most major suppliers and at the same time pushed the narrative that it was done by Reddit. Why?\n\nBecause they don't want people to know they're scared. They don't want people to know they are losing and buying commodities. This is their hedge, this is their attempt to cover their losses. They want to stock up on silver, but when they do that in large numbers the tickers and futures will spike. How do they explain that without giving away their position? \"Reddit did it.\"\n\nAfter they cause silver to spike in a meaningful way, they need someone to sell it off to. They've artificially created demand for silver and prevented suppliers from being able to sell to retail, and now it's trending on social media and boomer media. So what's the next step? How will they sell? Later on, they will push the silver narrative once more even harder, blaming Reddit for trying to collapse the dollar (because let's be real we fucking love clout) and all of the suppliers will suddenly have large amounts of silver available again for Reddit to get their hands on.\n\nThey want to egg you on, show you the proof by raising silver prices, and then sell it to you and line their pockets with your cash. Artificially raising the price and then selling it off the moment they can. There's a phrase for this but I think it keeps getting my posts removed.\n\nAnyone you see pushing SLV, AG, and physical silver is either heavily misinformed, a(u)(r)tistic beyond all belief, or paid off by a bank.\n\nYes, silver is heavily shorted. No, Reddit will not win a commodity war. Banks control actual physical supply lines, not just paper shares. There is no beating them at this game. People have tried and all but disappeared for it, multiple times.\n\nIf you want to ride their rise of silver then by all means go for it, but be aware that it is not retail investors causing this to rise. It is likely the people that need more ammo for this next week: Banks and HFs.\n\n\\-------------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\ude80 G\ud83d\ude80M \ud83d\ude80E\ud83d\ude80\n\nTL;DR\n\nBanks are blaming a spike in silver futures on Reddit to hide their own hedging, and are shilling silver here so that when it becomes available for purchase retail will pay a premium to 'get in' on a short that doesn't exist. Retail lines their pockets with money, and they get to empty their mansions of all the silver they hoarded.",

        "selftext": "So there's a lot of controversy going on regarding the idea of a silver squeeze. After what happened with gamestop, I'm convinced that this shit really might work out. On the other hand there are a lot of people thinking that this is just something to draw attention away from GME and withdraw fund from the stock. Let me assure you this is not my attention. And if you're all about GME I suggest reading here because it's a waste of time.\n\nI personally think that slv really might be the next big thing that could work out. Therefore I'd suggest to not go against the idea generally. Keep your hands at gamestop as long as you want, but once work is done, get together into this next big thing.\n\n\\*\\*Here's what happens or might happen:\\*\\*About the theory of the silversqueeze. Can't really be compared to the GME squeeze as it is not about squeezing out hedgefunds shortsellers in particular. The idea is that the silver price is priced way too low for the amount of silver that physically exists. The silvermarket volume on paper (exchanges/Futures..) is 250 times bigger than the supply of physical silver (just read this and didn't do my own DD if numbers are correct). The Idea is that a physical shortage will be caused and this would really let slv skyrocket with all that derivatives that are not backed. Now imagine some 7 million apes and the following retail investors that come after suddenly plunger the physical silver market...\n\nExample: Let's assume there is a shortage and Person A wants physical delivery of the future he bought. Person B as the seller needs to deliver 5000 ounces of silver. If supply is short, the person buys another future from Person C in order to be able to deliver the slv needed. You understand the reaction this causes.\n\nAlso the silver market is said to be manipulated and kept low for a long time. I have no opinion on this.\n\n\\*\\*What happened on the weekend?\\*\\*Silver already surged 20% since friday morning which was most likely a result of the news of \"Wallstreetbets taking over silver\" and \"Shortage in silver supply\".example: [https://twitter.com/bitpanda/status/1356023060814585859](https://twitter.com/bitpanda/status/1356023060814585859)Also I noticed several locals stores and online stores being sold out completely on silver and it looks like this is not only regarding a few small dealers.[https://www.theepochtimes.com/reddit-forum-sparks-physical-silver-shortage-on-major-dealers-websites\\_3679079.html](https://www.theepochtimes.com/reddit-forum-sparks-physical-silver-shortage-on-major-dealers-websites_3679079.html)Also social media generates a lot of heat.\n\nSo it look's like it's happening - if we're heading to a global shortage, prices could absolutely go to the moon and this is a big time chance to be with it at the beginning right now. Additionally there is a good chance that shortsellers have learnt from what was happening with GME and they might get out of their short positions earlier which will generate further momentum.\n\n**What you can do** in order to participate and make this work:It does not help the cause if you buy mining companys (even though it might generate good income). But still, in order moon the prices, you'll need to invest physically. The options are:\\* Buying silver futures and let it physically deliver. Only possible if you can easily invest some 150k.\\* Buying slv or pslv if you live at the hamburgers, and for instance \"Xtrackers physical silber\" if you're from Europe. It's really important that you check if the fund needs to fully physically cover it's assets (=buy silver). Because not all do so.\\* The next option is to physically buy silver at your local store or webshop.\\* At last, you can buy options. Your counterpart might want to hedge the positions and therefore will potentially be covered. This is also obviously the part where you can win big time (or lose everything). My weapon of choice is:  34.00C expiring in April\n\nI prefer a mix of above.\n\nBut as we all know, I'm just another ape sharing brainfarts, hence I'm definitely not in the position to give financial advice. Also I'm long on slv, silver options and bought the silver of some local shops.\n\nTL;DR:This post is **NOT about GME**. No selly selly - I get the hype! But silver might be one of the best chances for the upcoming weeks I believe. And today it's still a chance to get in early at low prices.\n\ne/okay, guess we have to wait until GME is through. Looks like most in here aren't open for a new relationsship. Anything that's not GME/AMC gets downvoted to hell. ITT: People with weak hands scared of any funds going from gme to slv - this is ridiculous.  \n\ne2/ Thx for gold, even though silver would have done it!",

        "selftext": "I have been mulling over getting a position into Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co for the past week. It has had a nice little correction in the last couple weeks. I feel like the world is dangerously dependent on them and as EV boom continues the demand for semiconductors is only going to increase. \n\nThen, I just happened to stumble upon the HSBC MSCI Taiwan UCITS ETF. It is 32% exposure to TSM and 5% each to couple of other solid Taiwanese companies like Media Tek and Hon Hai. It also has ~3% in United Microelectronics Corp which is another solid company! \n\nI feel like the ETF would be a better choice than going for a single stock in TSM. Does anyone else have a position in either of the two or care to share their two cents?\n\nThanks!",

        "selftext": "**TLDR: \"CoNtrARiaN\" but actually just a\ndick-eating bear thesis that the SQUEEZE has in fact, been ALREADY SQUOZE.**\n\n_Let me preface that for all the 5M newbies to this sub, I\nam saddened that my favorite sub since 2017 has been invaded by normies. But at\nthe same time, I am excited for all the new amount of fodder (yeah, you) for\nmemes. So WELCOME TO THE GANG, GANG &amp;lt;3_\n\n**\n\nTHESIS: The big short squeeze has already happened.**\n\n**\n\nWhen?**\n\nApproximately from the when our lord and savior Burry probably cashed out\n(sometime before his settlement date for 13-F filing coming out in 2 weeks\ntime) to when the news broke and Cramer shat his pants on CNBC last Monday.\n\n**\n\nWhy do you think this?**\n\nFirst, MELVIN was NOT the ONLY ones SHORT, they were just\nthe slowest ones to cover (and hence probably will continue to be the poster-child for\nbukkake gang-rape by millennials and zoomers with stimmy checks).\n\nSecond, GME literally went from $5 per share to $37 per\nshare by January 15, 2021, the settlement date for the latest short float\nupdate (I\u2019ll come back to your fucking daily updates from S3 Partners and Ortex\nlater on, and why I don\u2019t trust them).\n\nTo put it into perspective for these unscrupulous, criminal,\nBIG money positions on the short-side that have been here a LOOOONG time,\nthat\u2019s already a 750% loss.\n\nIf someone had put in **JUST** $1M in August 2020 (by the\nway, the short float % was around 99% at this time, so I KNOW more got in short\nafter this) hoping for a Gamestop bankruptcy, by Jan 15, 2021 these fuckers\nwould have lost $8M in total (initiating position would have been about 200K\nshares short, by the time it gets to 1/15/2021, $37 x 200K shares =\u00a0 $7.4M.\n\nSo, by wagering $1M on the short side, you now have to buy\nback and return your shares. You now have a $6.4M loss.\n\n**WELL THAT FUCKING SUCKS? Right? Well then what does a 400-IQ,\nuncircumcized-dick hedgie with a wedgie want to do about this situation? They\nGOTTA make that loss back SOMEWAY SOMEHOW.**\n\nYou could suck trucker dick or deal drugs, but these\nwhite-collar yuppies have enough power to NOT have to stoop down to that level.\n\n**\n\nHere is how they CAN, and probably ARE, doing it right\nnow:**\n\nMelvin wasn\u2019t the only short position. Just the most\nretarded one that didn\u2019t cover in time, so they had to go through a whole\nfucking liquidity crisis, class action lawsuit, and dick-eating meme-fest while\nliterally asking for sugar-daddy money. What about the less retarded short\npositions? Well, they probably have some losses too, because I mean, they did\nget squeezed in the earlier portion of the play, but now they have sights on\nsomething else.\n\n**First, your hedgies (excluding Melvin &amp; Citron)\ncontinue to push the narrative: \u201cThrow Melvin &amp; Citron to the masses and\nkeep the retail investors coming in with their diamond hands and high school\ndiplomas.\u201d**\n\nSecond, **hedgies go LONG on GME shares now**. WTF HOW?\nWell remember that for short positions, there are LENDERS of these shares.\nThese lenders would happily let go of their positions at the \u201ctop\u201d of a\nsqueeze. (It\u2019s ez fucking profit, and they want none of this mess).\n\nThird, you now have a long position with underlying shares.\nWhat\u2019s the best play here? You fucking write call options because the vol\npremiums are literally mooning at the moment. And I\u2019ve been on WSB long enough\nto know that WSB\u2019s risk management is literally just selling one-paired organ\nto afford the option premium on FDs.\n\nLastly, you push the narrative of a \u201cGAMMA SQUEEZE\u201d which is\nJUST a little bit too hard for your average joe from Mississippi to understand\nwith his Algebra 2 from high school \u2013 Essentially telling him, \u201cHEY THERES\nSTILL MORE TO SQUEEEEEZE.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n**\n\nREAL Gs MOVE IN SILENCE:**\n\nLook at the volumes, the float rotation in the past week for\nGME is already enough to have fucked virgins 20 times and sacrificed them to\ncapitalist gods. \n\nWhich means for hedgies with wedgies, it\u2019s no longer a\ntail-risk, blind-side event, it\u2019s time to REAP the souls of every stimmy check\nfool, by \u201cMaRkET MAkInG\u201d.\n\nIf I am that Hedgie, I write call options, while maintaining\na fa\u00e7ade that I will \u201crationally\u201d hedge those positions by buying more of the\nunderlying shares. FUN FACT: I already have them.\n\nYou stimmy check tards will keep buying into GME, because\nyou heard about it in the news over the weekend and want to get in on this\naction to \u201cSTICK IT TO THE MAN\u201d because 2020 has been an absolute suicidal\ndescent into madness because of COVID. You will probably go on for a couple\nmore days this upcoming week, now that liquidity restrictions are slowly being\nlifted on trading platforms.\n\nSO, while you fools supply buying volume, all I have to do\nis collect my premiums on option sales, while slowly unwinding my underlying\nshare positions, and thereby also managing risk of option assignment since I\u2019ll\nsell shares into every spike and swerve the price away from the strike price of\nYOUR options.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll also have an expectation as to where GME could\npotentially rise to. You just look at the WSB subscriber count, multiply that\nby the avg retail trader account liquidity.\n\nYou guys will think you have stuck it to the man, but the\nman is sticking your wife ALREADY, ever since the moment you got angry and\nemotional about an opportunity to unleash your pent up hatred towards the Wall\nStreet system. All I am saying is, for every tard like Melvin, there\u2019s 20 other\nhedgies out there to fuck you up without you even realizing it. After all it\u2019s\ndone, they\u2019ll even make you feel bad, saying you were \u201cGreedy\u201d and \u201cReckless\u201d,\nfurther perpetuating emotional volatility in markets that they will keep\nprofiting off of.\n\nSo while the retail GME HODLER thinks there\u2019s still enough\ngold raining from the top of midtown Manhattan, all they\u2019re getting is piss and\npre-cum.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**\n\nAPPENDIX \u2013 Ortex &amp; S3 Partners**\n\nIf you got all the way through until now, I apologize for my\nlack of presentation in this thesis, it\u2019s literally 3AM in the East Coast US\nbecause I\u2019m up for 4AM pre-market (don\u2019t fucking judge me, I\u2019m a retard too).\n\nSo I\u2019ll explain that point from WAY up there about short\ninterest estimates.\n\nI don\u2019t give a flying fuck what Ortex and S3 Partners says.\nI do NOT believe that short float is STILL above %100 after the official data\ncame out on 1/27 with a lag of two fucking weeks from its settlement date on\n1/15. The stock price moved so egregiously that every autist in Manhattan would\nhave literally gone bankrupt if they\u2019re still short, NOT just Melvin.\n\nSee, here\u2019s the thing. If the system is ALREADY built with\nthis **two weeks lag** on short data for individual stocks, what fucking\ndata analytics company in their right mind would NOT try to take advantage of\nthis time &amp; information arbitrage? The system is FUCKED, but it gets\nperpetuated because the ones perpetuating this have the MOST to gain.\n\nOrtex and S3 Partners is purely a marketing ploy, they\nhopped on this gravy train to get your subcriptions and some more clicky-clicks\non their website traffic so they can use those metrics to raise some more funds\nlater on.\n\nAnd even if they believed in your cause, no smart data\nanalytics firm would willingly give up that information arbitrage to the\npublic, if they want to ever think about doing business with ANY hedge-fund in\ntown.\n\nTherefore, I am sticking to my autistic thought that the\nsystem is stacked (which most of you agree) against us. BUT, I urge you to be a\nlittle bit more careful, because short float data can be misleading at best and\na total fraudulent bull-trap at worst. \n\nAgain, If you are new here, welcome to the gang. This sub\nwill always be about losing money and becoming best friends with your wife\u2019s\nboyfriend. But over time, it will be about the friends and knowledge you gained\nalong the way.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**\n\nThank you for listening to my ted-talk. I expect a PHD\ntag for my 8-inch dick.**",

        "selftext": "Preface: Everyone hates GME thoughts that appear negative, if you hate this I get it. This is not meant as a negative scare tactic but only a potential hypothesis of what may occur.\n\n1. GameStop has the ability to raise a secondary offering by issuing more shares into either the public or private markets. Technically, they can issue 300 million shares. Here is an SEC Filing from 2005 [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000119312513364182/d569889dex31.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000119312513364182/d569889dex31.htm)\n2. Even if the above SEC filing did not exist they would probably structure something to allow a secondary offering as the market has given them a second lifeline ( Just 1 year ago they were a company worth $200m today they are worth 100x that).\n3. It is highly unlikely that GameStop will issue 300 million shares or even 100 million shares\n4. I believe it is realistic to think that they may raise $1-2 Billion in a secondary offering probably some portion of debt and equity (not just flooding the market).\n5. They could do this by either offering a non-dilutive secondary offering by selling their shares they currently hold, or by causing a dilution event and issuing more shares\n6. In a dilution event this would look like adding 10% of shares to the market which will have some impact but doubt it will crater the stock.\n7. Google raised about $4 Billion through something similar in 2005 [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondaryoffering.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondaryoffering.asp)\n8. In some ways it would be foolish for the company not to take advantage of the current situation and raise some amounts of additional capital.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: GameStop will likely do a secondary offering but it will be unlikely flood the market with 300 million shares.\n\nThese are just my best guesses not facts.",

        "selftext": "There's a lot of confirmation bias around (mainly on /r/WSB) and anything against the grain gets shot down for the most part. **Nothing in this comment is financial advice.**\n\nI think people need to expect a &lt;$1000 share price at the height of the squeeze.\n\n[S3 stating that the short float has significantly reduced](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356017621649383426) as of data available last night. Admittedly, no exact figures here, but that is due this morning - People on this sub and /r/WSB have been using these as a source of truth since this started and discount them as soon as it goes against the narrative. People seem to be dismayed at this due to the low volume of trades on the last few days of last week, but consider whether Melvin covered their shorts [off-market](https://www.outlookindia.com/outlookmoney/equity/all-you-need-to-know-about-off-market-trading-3291#:~:text='Off%20Market%20Trade'%20is%20one,by%20one%20individual%20to%20another.) using other HFs (such as BlackRock who had an approx. 9million long position). I'm sure BlackRock would be up for protecting the integrity of the market for a guaranteed share price.\n\n[The avg. interest rate on the shorts has reduced.](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) Again, another source of truth used by this sub. Less interest could indicate a reduction in the number of open shorts. This also suggests that they could last a lot longer holding onto their short position.\n\nThere's a QAnon-level of conspiracy surrounding this and with Melvin having around ~30 employees, I just can't see them pulling the level of media/market manipulation that people are accusing them of without the help of their investors Point72 &amp; Citadel, at least.\n\nWhat are peoples' thoughts? How much *really* can the share price increase? Have we already seen the peak?\n\nFor transparency, my open positions is 80 long @ $75.",

        "selftext": "**Stocks end their worst week since October at their lowest point on Friday. Is the Short-Squeeze Over? Over 100 companies report earnings this week. Let\u2019s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of Friday as we saw the stock market finish with another sell-off, as the big 3 indices finished with the worst week since late October with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Vpq92y3) losing almost 2%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/yN3b3RQ) losing exactly 2% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/D7Cy2YQ) shedding 620 points and dropping below 30k. All 3 of them finished the week down more than 3% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/cgz4N3r) spiked yet again on Friday, rising by almost 10% and finishing the week up more than 40%.\n\nWe saw over 70% of the companies declining [Friday](https://ibb.co/G3rX22D), as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average dropped under 50%, with all 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/HKhY6hC) finishing in the red again, as Energy &amp; Tech were the biggest losers. \n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/jVFqVbH). It\u2019s really hard to find any gaining companies, with big tech companies selling off yet again, as most of the small gainers were found in the Health Care sector. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/5Y5HR4q)  though, Microsoft was the only big tech name that managed to gain ground after smashing the earnings report, while most of the stock market faced sell-off pressures as the short squeeze mania might have pushed investors into a risk-off approach.\n\nWe also got some economic data on Friday as the December personal disposable [INCOME](https://ibb.co/Khyh7mP) increase by 0.6%, more than expected as this mostly reflected an increase in social benefits &amp; compensations, with the Q4 employment cost [INDEX](https://ibb.co/QcqbM5y) also rising by 0.7% to close out the year.\n\nMeanwhile we saw the Consumer Sentiment [INDEX](https://ibb.co/pX3mFgt) coming in at 79, slightly lower than expected, as this was also seen in the December pending home sales [NUMBER](https://ibb.co/m4tbnWN), which also came in with a 0.3% decrease month/month.\n\nThis week we have somewhat of a quiet economic [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v), with a couple of interesting numbers through the week, while [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/rxmpwVK) take center stage yet again, with interesting reports coming from companies like Amazon, Google &amp; Alibaba on Tuesday, while Wednesday we hear from PayPal, Qualcomm &amp; Spotify. We also get earnings reports from some recent favorites like Pinterest, Snap, Ford, Peloton and Penn on Thursday as the earnings season with over 100 companies from the SP500 reporting, might help push the stock market higher after the sell-off last week.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/C0CSdJJ) reporting a new monthly record with 7225 vehicles delivered in the first month of 2021\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80, an increase of more than 350% Y/Y as the company is still ramping up production in an attempt to challenge Tesla\u2019s EV dominance. Nio has had a huge run in the past months but has a long way to go to grow into the big valuation, though the trajectory of the company looks very promising.\n\nMeanwhile the biggest development in the markets was the trading platforms [imposing](https://ibb.co/y5sPVJv) restrictions on the squeezed stocks and even many other stocks that didn\u2019t have such a big short % of the float with big names like AMD, Starbucks &amp; Moderna being affected. These restrictions were reduced back to only 8 companies [Sunday](https://ibb.co/GV5TKxf), but are still limited to whole share aggregate buy limits on the crowd favorites\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.\n\nThe recent moves in the stock market have made some big changes in the social world as Steve Cohen deactivate his [Twitter](https://ibb.co/0KK2P59) \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80, while a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/Mf6V8tz) showed that more than \u00be of respondents are planning on leaving RBNHD while 13% already did it, with the limiting tactics being probably the biggest reason for retail investors to make this change.\n\nInteractive [Brokers](https://ibb.co/JzR5qCC) also re-opened trading on these names on Sunday, which brings to question if these platforms have insider knowledge of the future of the stocks, or did they just increased their liquidity just like [RBNHD](https://ibb.co/P6WXwDj) after they raised more than $1B earlier in the week.\n\nSo\u2026 I think the stock market is still very volatile and the short squeezes can keep on going for an unknown period of time as markets can act in an unusual pattern for longer than anyone can anticipate, or the short squeeze can vanish in a second\u2026 this one is very hard to predict\u2026 Yes, keep the pedal to the medal in the hot stocks\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 but also stay invested in great companies as good earnings reports haven\u2019t helped most stocks again this quarter, but may provide good buying opportunities for the long-term.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nAnd finally, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wc2P16r) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way as we await to see the Manufacturing Indexes numbers in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v).\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "You know, traditionally r/wsb smooth brain has been a simple animal with a heart of gold. If things have gone wrong, you guys haven't learned anything at all from it. But if you have hit a jackpot, you have been generous with donations to charities.\n\nBut the one thing we haven't really shared as much has been the deep wisdom of the ordinary people from all walks of life. I mean, we would teach our own kids everything we know, so why not do the same for those struggling hedge fund managers, right? I mean, they are only trying to make living and are clearly in a need for some fatherly guidance (just not in the Vatican way of giving it), so I just though it would be time to make a concerted effort to give something back.\n\nI was very inspired by the comments section at r/news, where people are already giving some very helpful advice.\n\nu/Blank_bill suggested that they should invest their money. This is a solid advice. I've heard that McDonald's has been known to help learning this, so hedge fund managers really should give it a shot getting a job there. Like u/GhostofRimbaud said it, they should try looking in the paper and going into establishments with resume in hand, give the boss a firm handshake and ask for a job. I like this, it gives a good impression.\n\nu/bill_hilly also very helpfully noted, that stock market has an inherent risk, so they should not invest more than they are willing to lose. But they could use that stimulus check to do that, u/dietsaddad was kind enough to point that one is coming in no time at all, just 10 short months.\n\nMany people, including but not limited to u/BrownSugarBabe, rightfully pointed that skipping the avocado toast and Starbucks coffee and maybe driving an Uber would help to make up the difference. As u/artbored noted, they wouldn't be struggling nearly as much if they just skipped those $7 lattes.\n\nThat's an amazing insight and managers clearly should learn from this. They just have to, as u/csirke4 and many others pointed out, pull themselves by the bootstraps. Maybe learn to code Python or something.\n\nOr perhaps, like u/WeAllSuk pointed, maybe they have some old video games that they could sell.\n\nBut if they can't get a job (although u/coachmdubz said the nearest Amazon warehouse is hiring), they could just, as kindly noted by u/Brewboo, \"maybe take that unpaid internship and through hard work and determination one day they too can have a lucrative career.\"\n\nThis is amazing, with this advice those poor managers on a good career path in no time at all. Or like u/HeyItsTheShanster said, they could learn a trade and be their own bosses.\n\nPersonally, I believe families should help and support each other and it's very normal in most part of the world for the children to help out their struggling parents. I mean, camgirls are always wanted and there is always that occasional r/wallstreetbets millionaire in need of that special massage, that could really help to pay for a tuition if the hedge fund manager's paycheck from the Wendy's is not quite enough.\n\nNow, I know what you guys are thinking: \"hedge fund managers don't read reddit and those texts in billboards and behind flying airplanes are too damn short!\" This is why we could use some outside help to make all the users' helpful advice more visible to them. Just like John Oliver always helped Trump on Fox commercial breaks.\n\nBut I'm sure those poor, struggling hedge fund managers could use all the advice $GME holders can give them from their vast life experiences. Now, we wouldn't want them have to sell one of their yachts, would we?\n\nI am eagerly waiting to hear all the nuggets of wisdom you guys have to give for those poor folks at Melvin Capital and their friends.\n\nEdit: grammar\n\nEdit 2: since some people seem confused, let me clarify. Point is that one of the great pleasures of life is to piss people off by making them eat their own words. If you can make it publicly in an incredibly sarcastic and passive-aggressive tone, even better.\n\nIn this case, giving the reckless billionaire fucks running the hedge funds the same condescending advice \"lazy\" young people struggling with a low-wage dead-end jobs have been receiving for years.\n\nEdit 3: It's one thing to shit on hedge funds by refusing to sell, but we can do better, we can really rub it in while we still have the media attention. \n\nIf even one person with journalistic or otherwise relevant background or any connection to reporters, actors, screenwriters or other people sees this and sees some potential comedic value in it and any of the lines end up being used somewhere, we might have been able ruin some bigwig's day. And it won't cost us a penny.",

Respectively, that\u2019s a share\nprice increase of 77% and 225%. A critical note is that these ratings are quite recent, not historic. For example, Mizuho upgraded Selecta Biosciences as recently as [last week](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-selb-a-buy-or-sell-right-now-2021-01/), while HC Wainwright issued a buy rating on January 7th, and Canaccord Genuity set a $13.00 [price target](https://www.analystratings.com/articles/canaccord-genuity-sticks-to-its-buy-rating-for-selecta-biosciences-selb/) also on January 7th. \n\n &gt; The stock currently trades at a 21% discount from its 52 week high of $4.83.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**COMPANY OVERVIEW**\n\nSelecta Biosciences is a clinical-stage biotechnology company, headquartered in Watertown, Massachusetts, and led by President and CEO, Dr. Carsten Brunn, who previously served as the President of Pharmaceuticals at Bayer (American Region). Selecta Biosciences was founded in 2008, and initiated their public offering on June 22nd, 2016. Their flagship product is the clinically-validated ImmTOR platform, a system for developing antigen-specific tolerogenic therapies. They have acquireed partnerships with multiple major pharmaceutical\ncompanies, including [Sobi](https://www.sobi.com/), [Serepta Therapeutics](https://www.sarepta.com/), and [AskBio](https://www.askbio.com/), and they have recently received a consensus analyst buy rating, with an upper end price target of $13, representing a 225% increase from the current share price. The science behind Selecta, and their ImmTOR technology, is largely based on a 1994 [research paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8128245/) published in the journal *Science*. In 2006, [Dr. Omid Farokhzad](https://farokhzad.bwh.harvard.edu/wp/members/principal-investigator/), a professor at Harvard Medical school and the director of [The Center for Nanomedicine at BWH](https://nanomedicine.bwh.harvard.edu/), along with prolific MIT inventor, [Dr. Robert Langer](https://www.statnews.com/2016/05/31/robert-langer-biotech-new-york-city/), published a [highly cited paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17070960/) showing how to use synthesized nanoparticles to deliver drugs to cancer cells. In 2008, they founded Selecta Biosciences with Harvard immunologist Ulrich von Andrian.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHAT DOES THE COMPANY MANAGEMENT LOOK LIKE?**\n\nIf you have followed some of my previous posts and comments, you will know that I consider management to be the most important factor. Regardless of the product, industry, or finances, it is the people running the company that will determine its success. In my opinion, among every biotechnology company that I have evaluated, Selecta Biosciences has the strongest management team.\n\nSelecta Biosciences is led by President and CEO, Dr. Carsten Brunn, who holds a Ph.D\nin chemistry, from the University of Hamburg. Prior to his work at Selecta, Dr. Brunn was\nthe president of Pharmaceuticals for the Americas Region at Bayer. He served as chairman\nof the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations Japan, and he held senior leadership positions at Eli Lilly, Novartis, Basilea, and Bausch &amp; Lomb.\n\nSelecta\u2019s Chief Scientific Officer is Dr. Takashi Keisters Kishimoto, who holds a Ph.D in immunology\nfrom Harvard University. Dr. Kishimoto was previously the Vice President of Discovery\nResearch at Momenta Pharmaceuticals, a biotechnology company that was purchased\nBy Johnson &amp; Johnson in October of 2020, for $6.5 billion. Over the course of his career, \nDr. Kishimoto has published over 50 peer-reviewed articles in major scientific journals, \nIncluding Nature, Science, and The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nAmong their all-star Board of Directors is [Dr. Goran A. Ando](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/gran-ando), a 37 year veteran in the\npharmaceutical industry. Dr. Ando is the former Chairman of the Board of Novo Nordisk, one \nof the world\u2019s leading pharmaceutical companies. Prior to that, Dr. Ando held executive\npositions at Pfizer and Bristol-Myers. \n\nFor a full list of leadership, please use [this link](https://selectabio.com/about-us/).\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHAT IS THE ImmTOR PLATFORM?**\n\nLet\u2019s start with an introduction to the problem. Immunogenicity is the ability of a substance to stimulate an antigen-specific immune response. Antigens include a wide array of substances produced by cells,\nbacteria, fungi, or other organisms, but they are typically proteins. Unfortunately, immunogenicity can cause unwanted immune responses, such as the formation\nof anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), which can alter the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of different drugs, or the induction of hypersensitivity reactions, which have life-threatening\nconsequences. ImmTOR is coadministered with biologic therapies, and it is shown to restore natural tolerance and enable patients to remain on therapies longer.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**HOW DOES THE ImmTOR PLATFORM WORK?**\n\nFrom Selecta Biosciences,\n\n&gt; ImmTOR is designed to induce antigen-specific immune tolerance by targeting rapamycin to immune cells using nanoparticle technology, which has been clinically proven as an effective delivery system. When administered to a patient, ImmTOR nanoparticles are filtered out by lymph nodes, spleen and liver, where they are taken up by antigen-presenting cells (APC), such as dendritic cells (DC), a type of APC which can trigger immunogenic as well as tolerogenic responses from T cells. ImmTOR promotes the induction of tolerogenic DC which go on to activate antigen-specific regulatory T cells to suppress the immune response to the antigen.\n\nFor a more in-depth look at ImmTOR, please refer to [this article](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.00969/full#:~:text=general%20immune%20suppression%20is%20supported,to%20subsequent%20challenge%20with%20antigen), which discusses\nThe development of ImmTOR Tolerogenic Nanoparticles.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHAT DOES THEIR PIPELINE LOOK LIKE?**\n\nFor a portfolio overview, please use [this link](https://selectabio.com/portfolio/)\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHERE CAN I FIND PEER-REVIEWED RESEARCH?**\n\nYou can find a selection of peer-reviewed research [here](https://selectabio.com/resources/).\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHAT PARTNERSHIPS HAS SELECTA SECURED?**\n\nSelecta has several research and commercial rights partnerships with global pharmaceutical companies. These \ninclude [Sobi](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/06/11/2047185/0/en/Sobi-and-Selecta-announce-strategic-licensing-agreement-for-SEL-212-a-phase-3-ready-novel-treatment-for-Chronic-Refractory-Gout.html), for strategic licensing of SEL-212, [AskBio](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/12/19/1962801/0/en/AskBio-Licenses-Rights-to-Selecta-Biosciences-ImmTOR-Immune-Tolerance-Platform-for-the-Treatment-of-Pompe-Disease.html) for the use of ImmTOR in the treatment\nof Pompe Disease, and [Serepta Therapeutics](https://investorrelations.sarepta.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sarepta-therapeutics-and-selecta-biosciences-enter-research)\nfor the use of ImmTOR for the treatment of neuromuscular diseases.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHAT IS THE VALUE PROPOSITION?**\n\nThis is likely one of the easiest questions to answer. A large amount of drugs provoke unwanted immune responses, which reduce a drug\u2019s efficacy\nand exacerbate adverse effects. The ImmTOR platform creates drug-specific immune tolerance, enhancing the effectiveness of drugs, as well\nas its safety profile. This means the ImmTOR platform can be used in cooperation with a substantial amount of other drugs. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHAT IS SELECTA BIOSCIENCES FINANCIAL SITUATION?**\n\n\n*Recent Financing:* \n\nOn June 11th of 2020, Selecta entered into a [strategic licensing agreement](https://www.sobi.com/en/press-releases/sobi-and-selecta-announce-strategic-licensing-agreement-sel-212-phase-3-ready-novel)\nwith [Sobi](https://www.sobi.com/en/about), and international biopharmaceutical company worth $48 billion. \nThe agreement is for SEL-212, Selecta\u2019s phase-3-ready therapy powered\nby ImmTOR, their immune tolerance platform. Included in the deal is an initial\npayment of $100 million, commercial and milestone payments of up to\n$630 million, tiered double-digit royalties on net sales, and equity purchases at $4.62/share.\nThis means you can currently purchase shares at a discount to what Sobi paid. \n\n\nOn September 1st of 2020, Selecta Biosciences secured up to [$35 million in debt financing](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/09/01/2086854/0/en/Selecta-Biosciences-Secures-Up-To-35-Million-Debt-Financing-with-Oxford-Finance-LLC-and-Silicon-Valley-Bank.html#:~:text=Under%20the%20terms%20of%20the,achievement%20of%20two%20development%20milestones%3A), available in two tranches, \nwith $25 million issued at closing, and an additional $10 million available through September 30th of 2021. Part of these proceeds will be used to retire $12.6 million\nin existing debt.\n\n*Cash Position:* \n\nSelecta had $147.6 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash as of September 30, 2020, which compares to cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $91.6 million as of December 31, 2019. Selecta believes its available cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash as of September 30, 2020 will enable Selecta to fund operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the first quarter of 2023.\n\n*Revenue:* \n\nRevenue recognition for the third quarter 2020 was $4.6 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2020, we recognized $4.3 million under the license agreement with Sobi resulting from the shipment of clinical supply and the reimbursement of costs incurred for the Phase 3 DISSOLVE clinical program and $0.3 million for shipments under the collaboration agreement with Sarepta. During the three months ended September 30, 2019, Selecta did not recognize revenue.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHAT KEY MILESTONES HAVE RECENTLY BEEN ACHIEVED?**\n\n* **1.** In September, Selecta commenced the Phase 3 clinical program, known as [DISSOLVE](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/09/23/2097859/0/en/First-Patient-Randomized-in-the-Phase-3-DISSOLVE-Clinical-Program-of-SEL-212-for-Chronic-Refractory-Gout.html) for the clinical evaluation of SEL-212, which is the foundation\nfor Selecta\u2019s pipeline of tolerogenic therapies. \n\n* **2.** In October, the FDA granted Selecta the [Rare Pediatric Disease Designation](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/20/2111023/0/en/Selecta-Biosciences-and-AskBio-Receive-FDA-Rare-Pediatric-Disease-Designation-for-their-Gene-Therapy-for-Methylmalonic-Acidemia.html) for MMA-101, used in the treatment of\nIsolated methylmalonic academia. This designation highlights the significant unmet medial need that Selecta is seeking to address. Phase 1 clinical trials\nare expected to begin in the first half of 2021, with data expected before the end of the year. \n\n* **3.** Also in October, Selecta and IGAN Biosciences entered into a [research license and option agreement](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/08/2105919/0/en/Selecta-Biosciences-and-IGAN-Biosciences-Enter-into-Research-License-and-Option-Agreement-to-Study-Selecta-s-ImmTOR-Immune-Tolerance-Platform-in-Combination-with-IGAN-s-IgA-Proteas.html)\nwhich provides Selecta with the option to exclusive licensure for the rights to develop and commercialize the ImmTOR platform in\ncombination with IGAN\u2019s [IgA protease](https://www.iganbio.com/iga-protease-for-igan/), which is used to treat [IgA Nephropathy](https://igan.org/)\n\n* **4.** On January 6th, Selecta announced pre-clinical data in non-human primates\nthat validated the ImmTOR platform\u2019s ability to enhance the efficacy, safety and durability of \nadeno-associated viral vector gene therapies. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHAT DOES THE INSIDER ACTIVITY LOOK LIKE**\n\nInsider activity is an excellent way to assess the confidence of the company executives. I\u2019m sure most of you are familiar with the phrase, \u201cput your money\nwhere your mouth is\u201d. I prefer to speculate on companies where the executives have a large incentive for success.\n\nOver the last twelve months, we\u2019ve seen a staggering 9,351,485 [shares purchased by insiders](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/selb/insider-activity), compared against 13,314 that were sold.\nOn January 4th of 2021, we saw 262,000 non-open market shares acquired by company officers, and in October, Timothy Springer [purchased a whopping](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/timothy-springer-just-bought-25-142015780.html)\n$5.4 million worth of stock.\n\nIn addition to this, Selecta has an astounding institutional ownership of 64.41%, compiled from 98 different institutional holders.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHAT DOES THE OPTION CHAIN LOOK LIKE?**\n\nSelecta has options available with three strike prices and expirations on March 19th, June 18th, and September 17th. The March 19th $5 call options have recently seen a volume spike, and had\nan open interest of 2564 as of Friday, January 29th. These are the highest volume of all available options. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHY AM I PURCHASING THE STOCK NOW?**\n\nIn my opinion, all clinical-stage biotechnology companies present three obvious challenges. Will their product work, do they have enough capital to reach commercialization, and have they partnered with any major company that can accelerate their product or service? Prior to discovering these answers, biotechs are highly speculative. After years of development, I believe that Selecta has reached all three milestones. In light of these milestones, as well as analyst endorsements, FDA approvals, institutional and insider purchasing, option volume and volatility, and growing sentiment, I think Selecta is poised for significant growth. Beyond this, I find tremendous value in a company that has licensing deals worth more than the companies entire market capitilization. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**TL:DR;**\n\nSelecta Biosciences is a Watertown, Massachusetts based biotechnology company. They are engaged in the \nresearch and development of nanoparticle immunomodulatory drugs that work in conjunction with existing\nbiologics, for the treatment and prevention of numerous human diseases. Their flagship product\nis the ImmTOR Tolerogenic Nanoparticle Platform, a technology used to mitigate anti-drug antibodies (ADAs)\nin response to life-sustaining drugs. Their lead pharmaceutical candidate is SEL-212, a Phase 3 enzymatic \ntherapy for the treatment of gout, one of the most common forms of arthritis. The company is managed by\na cast of successful executives, many of whom previously held leadership roles at Pfizer, Novo Nordisk, Bayer,\nand other global pharmaceutical companies. They are financed through 2023, and have recently received\na consensus buy rating from major analysts, with a price target range of $7-$13. The stock is majority held by \ninstitutional investors, and insiders have made large volume share acquisitions over the past several months. \nTheir partnership with Sobi, an international pharmaceutical juggernaut, is worth $100 million in\ninitial payments, and over $630 million in commercial and milestone payments. This deal alone\nis worth more than Selecta\u2019s entire market capitalization. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**POSITIONS**\n\n4,000 shares at $4.28, but I plan to increase my position this week.",

        "selftext": "Well, here they come hold on to your seats girls. Even CCIV has a mention. Chamath too. \n\nARTICLE (abbreviated):\n\n[WSJ:  GameStop Day Traders Are Moving Into SPACs](https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestop-day-traders-are-moving-into-spacs-11612175401)\n\nDay traders fueling enormous gains in popular stocks such as GameStop Corp. GME 67.87% are also powering big swings for another suddenly hot investment: so-called blank-check companies. \n\nSpecial-purpose acquisition companies\u2014shell companies planning to merge with private firms to take them public\u2014are rising more than 6% on average on their first day of trading in 2021, up from last year\u2019s figure of 1.6%, according to University of Florida finance professor Jay Ritter. Before 2020, trading in SPACs was muted when they made their debut on public markets. \n\nNow, shares of blank-check companies almost always go up. The last 140 SPACs to go public have either logged gains or ended flat on their opening day of trading, per a Dow Jones Market Data analysis of trading in blank-check companies through Thursday. One hundred and seventeen in a row have risen in their first week. The gains tend to continue, on average generating bigger returns going out to a few months. \n\nThe gains in companies that don\u2019t yet have any underlying business underscore the wave of speculation in today\u2019s markets. Merging with a SPAC has become a popular way for startups in buzzy sectors to go public and take advantage of investor enthusiasm for futuristic themes.\n\nBut lately, day traders are even putting money into SPACs before they have revealed what company they are buying. At that stage, they are pools of cash, so investors are wagering that the company will eventually complete an attractive deal. \n\nDespite the risks, many are embracing the trade, underscoring how online investing platforms and social-media groups now send individuals flocking to new corners of markets, including shares of unprofitable companies such as GameStop and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. AMC 53.65% That trend also is playing out in everything from shares of silver miners to SPACs, which were relatively rare before last year but are suddenly ubiquitous in finance. \u201cI would just have a bad case of FOMO if I wasn\u2019t in SPACs,\u201d said Marco Prieto, a 23-year-old real-estate agent living in Tucson, Ariz., referring to the fear of missing out that is driving many individuals to put money into markets.\n\nHe has a roughly $50,000 portfolio and about 60% of his holdings tied to blank-check companies. Some of his positions are early on in shell firms such as Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp. VI, while others are based on rumors tied to possible deals by companies including Churchill Capital Corp. IV.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/05bjlwom0ve61.png?width=894&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7df4064e2799ed07d29f21944c621d77fb6f8c1a\n\nShares of that company have more than doubled since Bloomberg News reported on Jan. 11 that it is in talks to combine with electric-car firm Lucid Motors Inc. Trading got so frenzied that the SPAC put out a statement a week later saying it wouldn\u2019t comment on the report and that it is always evaluating a number of possible deals. The stock has still been gyrating in the days since. Investors betting on SPACs even before such reports is extraordinary because the underlying value of a blank-check firm before it pursues a deal is the amount of money it raises for a public listing. That figure is typically pegged at $10 a share. \n\nStill, it has become common for investors to buy at higher prices such as $11 or $12 to back big-name SPAC founders such as venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya and former Citigroup Inc. deal maker Michael Klein. In another sign blank-check firms are now frequently traded by individuals, several SPACs and companies that have merged with them recently joined GameStop and AMC on a list of stocks that have position limits on Robinhood Markets Inc., a popular brokerage for day traders. Those restricted include Mr. Klein\u2019s Churchill Capital IV and a few of Mr. Palihapitiya\u2019s SPACs in the Social Capital Hedosophia SPCE 2.74% franchise.\n\nMods: thanks for allowing this to be posted, it clearly is not pumping any of the companies that have recently gone up by 3000%",

        "selftext": "Hello stocks,\n\nI'm a relatively newer investor and have been picking up new information and gaining skills as I go along. With all this craziness happening in the stock market I had a really sobering experience that I've been having trouble with. This is maybe more of a mental and emotional self-care question than it is a stock question, but I figure some people here have had a similar experience and can help me out or share some advice or stories or something.\n\nI started accumulating some GME at the end of November based on all the DD that was floating around. I bought slowly and ended up with 255 shares at 55 cost bases and 7(!) april 29 $25 calls. I really didn't expect something like this to actually happen. I had a loss on this all through December so when the price shot up the first time in January I sold 4 calls for a $3000 profit. Thats the first big ouch. Those would be worth more than 100,000 right now.\n\nThe remaining securities I kept until the commotion last week. I had never expected to have so much money in my whole life. My account blew up to 250,000 at the peak on Friday (I started with 20,000). I had already taken some profits at 320, 100 shares. Then when the huge spike to 490 and dip to 115 happened on Friday I freaked out and sol 100 shares and 2 calls when GME was around $140.  was trading emotionally and scared and not logically. I had even laid out an exit strategy and I ignored it. This was obviously an incredibly stupid play and I feel heavy regret about it. I know I shouldn't. I made 1000x my initial investment already. Yet I still feel depressed. I don't feel like I gained 100,000. I feel like I lost 400,000.\n\nI know it's stupid and I'm incredibly lucky to have found myself in this incredible trade as such a new investor. But I still feel heavy regret and it's really getting me down at a moment in my life when I should be celebrating. How do you all deal with regret?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR\n\nI panic sold GME and made a 1000x profit but I traded emotionally and left so much money on the table. How do I get over the regret and be happy about my profit and remaining position?\n\nStill in for a call and 55 shares!",

        "selftext": "Second time posting....hopefully the mods approve:\n\nHey fellow retards, I just wanted flag this great post by [u/MarioBuzo](https://www.reddit.com/u/MarioBuzo/) and offer a high-level version for those in the trenches. Basically, you're not only fighting the shorts, but the media (surprise!), the DTCC and its clearing agents while the regulatory bodies remain indifferent (complicit?). As always, assume what you will. Synopsis post below.\n\n1. First, the shorts work with the banks to create fraudulent shares to drive the price down. This was most likely the cause of Thursday\u2019s dip in GME\u2019s shares. The HFs and the bank literally trade the same shares back and forth with each other to drive the price down in larger volumes than the buy orders and then never deliver the shares because they never own them in the first place. This technique is known as \u201cstrategic fails-to-deliver\u201d and is basically given a pass by the SEC.\n2. Next, the shorts work with the usual media suspects and research analysts to push their lies.\n3. Third, the DTCC, which is the central repository for all shares and owned by the brokerages, allows the creation of billions of counterfeit shares through a process called Continuous Net Settlement (CNS) that never even make it to the SEC. This is where everything gets very murky. Naturally, the DTCC has resisted every effort at transparency.\n4. Fourth, brokerages pull margin from customers causing a flood of margin selling, which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares that they need to cover. (Anyone seen that recently?)\n\nThe short's playbook today is the same as its always been. Only it never accounted for a WSB rebellion.\n\nI highly suggest reading the articles because I\u2019m only skimming the surface of how complicated and rigged the entire system is. Not surprisingly the root cause is the sheer amount of money involved for all the players.\n\nTLDR: HOLD! \ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "Too Long Can't Read: HOLD GME!!! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf19\n\nFirst, I'm not an advisor or some quant with some bullshit MBA from a Top Tier school trying to scare anybody. \n\nWith everybody dropping RH like my ex-wife dropping me for Chad, I wanted to read on the process during the transfer of these accounts. \n\nI noticed a post where Fidelity was up 700% in transfer requests this weekend. I would assume the same for other non BROKErages. \n\nI have Fidelity and I use ToS for charting, but I read up on the process for transfer from RH. First you have to pay $75 bucks to get transferred from RH. That's a crock of shit but I guess its still \"free\" trading. \n\nSecondly, RH will sell your fractional shares prior to transfer through ACATS (This is the system for \"transferring\" shares from one brokerage to another). This will take place prior to T+2 which is the SEC standard. Now when your transfer is taking place you do not have access to trading your stonks at all. Time to bring back the old PornHub..\n\nThirdly, all your limit orders have been canceled during this process. This means that if GME tanks (HOLD you dumbfuck) you will be out of it and just screaming at the screen seeing dildos (green or red) while your wife is boned by her bf.\n\nLastly, the process fully takes 10-14 days to \"settle\". You get credit for the stonks at T+2 but there could be restrictions on trading depending on the brokerage. Fidelity does not have this issue...\n\nBut broneilbro...what does this mean for GME? Well, kid...\n\n1. RH will clump all the fractional shares from the transferees together and dump them at market per RH \n&gt; \"If you have any fractional shares during a full account transfer, they will be sold, and the resulting funds will be transferred to the other brokerage as cash during a residual sweep.\" https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/transfer-stocks-out-of-your-robinhood-account/** \n\n  These will be gobbled up by hopefully the GMEGang but it will supply shares to the market. Depending on how many full shares this could minimal if assuming a .99 fractional share x RH transferees...\n\n2. The GME shares that are transffered will effectively be \"off the table\" during the ACAT process which will lead to a massive \"group\" HOLD for T+2 days depending on when RH autists transferred out. This should cause a drop in volume since GME retards won't be able to trade but will help out as the shorts cannot buy these shares as they are out of play.\n\n3. The process for getting margin approval and options access could take a few days due to the volume of transferees. This will show up as a general \"pause\" within GME as traders are waiting for account access. This could be good or bad depending on the view. \n\n4. This mass transfer out of RH will be a blessing to them as they will not have to deal with the GME liquidity funding mechanisms. \n\nJust my thoughts on everybody fleeing RH...there will be a slight pause but that will give people a chance to poke around the platforms and get used to it prior to going all in on GME...\n\nTLDR: HOLD GME!!! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf19 &lt;Almost forget these...&gt;\n\nLong: GME = 500 at 38 at Fidelity...",

        "selftext": "\ud83d\ude80MAC\ud83d\ude80 is the best short squeeze play at the moment. If you missed the GME train then MAC is definitely what you have been waiting for. Mac has only increased by 80% since December, from 10$ to 16.8$, meaning this is a squeeze where you still have the opportunity to come aboard early.\n\nMAC is a solid company with short % of Float 85.84%, Short % of Shares Outstanding 52.55%, Shares Short 78M as of 30/1. This is even a good longterm play as they are currently severely undervalued &amp; has a good balance sheet.\n\nI think MAC can short squeeze much faster as well due to all the hype surrounding short squeezes in the market &amp; MAC being insanely undervalued. Which is making shorts very scared meaning they are more likely to cover way faster.\n\nMac recovered in 2009 after being fucked over by shorts and the same is guaranteed to happen now, the biggest difference is that this squeeze will be way bigger:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qxgv3570rue61.png?width=377&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a0bb0eb6053d67e8bdc79ee99bff77bd869e1c9\n\nMy pos:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/11vqyhg2rue61.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23deaff86a9461712581eb402e1def7ed4fa64d0\n\nThis is for sure the next short squeeze that will gain hype, you just need to join the MAC gang ride to tendie-town\u2122 and make more posts on different subreddits so MAC can gain hype even faster and to not to be paper-hand bitches. You need to hold the fucking line, buy the dips don't let the shorts scare you with their pathetic dips.\n\nWE ARE IN WAR WITH THE WALL STREET CORRUPTION, MELVIN CAPITAL AND CITADEL SHORT HEDGE FUND MANIPULATION.\n\nSTAY STRONG.\n\nTLDR:\n\n\\- Been shorted the fuck out of (Top 4)\n\n\\- Undervalued as fuck atm\n\n\\- The train has barely left the station compared to the other possible squeezes\n\n\\- A very low-risk play that has huge upside potential\n\n\\- Solid fundamentals, this is a good long term and short term play.\n\nSee you guys in tendie town \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is just a repost from Jussi Askola\u00b4s DD:\n\n* GameStop is going through a monumental short squeeze.\n* We think that its landlord, Macerich, is poised for a similar short squeeze.\n* MAC offers significant upside potential but with much better downside protection. For this reason, we believe that it is your next best short squeeze investment opportunity.\n\n**GameStop** (NYSE:GME) is up by nearly 200% in a single day\n\nContrarian investors who bought early into this short squeeze made fortunes in the process, and as a result, many of these same investors are today asking themselves:\n\n&gt;What the next best candidate for another short-squeeze?\n\nIf you look at a list of the most heavily shorted-stocks, you will find companies like Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY), AMC , Dillard's (DDS), and BlackBerry (BB), all of which are up significantly over the past weeks:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/55brjuc4rue61.png?width=635&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5002e77edf8d237d2d21e9a2f3147296f3c94704\n\nWe think that all of these companies offer significant upside potential as short sellers attempt to cover positions in fear of seeing another GME-like short squeeze.\n\nBut there is an even better short squeeze candidate, and it is called **Macerich** (MAC).\n\nMacerich is the landlord of all these companies. It owns some of the highest quality malls in the US and it is the fourth most heavily shorted company at the moment:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7dby1816rue61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c85ee9015d6708382622db784ba861902263d182\n\nf you are looking for a company with the potential to offer a GME-like short squeeze, but with better downside protection, MAC is your best pick.\n\nHere are 3 reasons why:\n\nReason #1: Significant Similarities to GameStop Will Attract Short Squeeze Hungry Investors\n\nUnlike other short squeeze candidates, MAC is actually in a direct business relationship with GME.\n\nGME is a mall-based video game retailer. MAC is the owner of the highest quality malls in the US, some of which are occupied by GME.\n\nAs such, MAC is the landlord and GME is the tenant. Both companies work hand in hand and MAC earns steady rental revenue from GME and other similar retailers.\n\nTherefore, anything that benefits GME also benefits MAC.\n\n&gt;**What are some other similarities between the two companies?**\n\n* They are some of the most heavily shorted companies in the world.\n* They have a small enough size to grow significantly.\n* They enjoy rapidly improving fundamentals.\n* They have an active options market.\n* And finally, they have a short thesis that's falling apart (more than in section #2 and #3)\n\nMAC is up by 30% over the past few days, but it remains down by 80% since 2015. Just to get to where it was, it would need to quadruple from here.\n\nIn comparison, GME is already trading at more than the triple of its previous all-time highs in 2007.\n\nIf MAC is going to follow GME's path, the short squeeze is just getting started.\n\nThat thought alone should be very scary to MAC short sellers. MAC is very similar to GME, and knowing what happened to GME, the risk-to-reward of shorting MAC has deteriorated very significantly over the past few days.\n\nHolding your short could literally ruin you.\n\nAs the shorts realize this, increasingly many may cover their position, causing the share price to rise, forcing others to cover too, causing the share price to rise even further, etc... It is the same virtuous cycle we have seen happen with GME.\n\nHowever, MAC enjoys better downside protection than GME, and this brings us to our next point:\n\nReason #2: Prime Real Estate Ownership And Sizable Cash Flow Provide Downside Protection\n\nGameStop, BlackBerry, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, AMC, and most other short squeeze candidates suffer one major issue:\n\nThey are extremely speculative companies.\n\nThey operate declining or even unprofitable businesses and offer little downside protection if and when the bubble bursts.\n\nA company like GameStop could drop back to where it was just as fast as it rose up. The company is losing money and it does not hold much tangible value.\n\nIn comparison, MAC is a much safer company with a resilient business, cash flow, and staying power.\n\nMAC owns the very best malls in the nation. These properties are not dying. Opposite of that, they have enjoyed steady sales and rent growth over the past decade:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uch3eh78rue61.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82e04be0f4a6b57520db1ce60b96c11fa2a47a7e\n\nEven through the Covid crisis, MAC has remained profitable and kept paying a dividend to shareholders. In the third-quarter conference call, the management noted that many of its malls have already recovered to \\~90% of pre-crisis sales per square foot.\n\nThis may surprise you, but there are good reasons why MAC's malls have so much staying power even in a highly digitized world.\n\nFirst of all, not all retail is created equal. The mall market is oversupplied in the US and as result, many of the lower-quality malls are dying. However, since MAC owns the highest quality malls, it actually benefits from this. As lower quality malls die, the supply of malls goes down, there is less competition, and the traffic consolidates towards the best malls, which are often owned by MAC.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u9gru9r9rue61.png?width=623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfc890012abc4311fc4bc9cf321b6f2519fbc745\n\nThe consolidation toward the best malls will only continue in the coming years and it will benefit MAC's properties.\n\nMoreover, MAC is busy redeveloping its malls to make them **Amazon**\\-proof (AMZN). Back in the day, malls were only for retail. You would go there for shopping, maybe there was a food court to grab a snack, and that's it.\n\nBut already today, MAC's malls are very different from what they used to be. They have become mixed-use destinations with large entertainment, service, hospitality, office, and even residential components.\n\nToday, retail is only one piece of the puzzle and all the other uses bring steady traffic and sales to the malls. Below you see a picture of Santa Monica Place, a MAC mall, with **Nike** (NKE) on the ground floor, and **Cheesecake Factory** (CAKE) right above it.\n\nIn short, we don't think that such properties are going anywhere.\n\nMAC owns highly valuable assets that generate significant cash flow that is likely to grow in the long run as a result of traffic consolidation towards the best malls and the continued redevelopment and densification of its assets.\n\n**Simon Property Group** (SPG) is one of the biggest and most successful real estate investors in the world and it offered to buy MAC at $95.50 per share back in 2015.\n\nSince then, the cash flow of its properties has only grown further, and yet, it trades at just below $20 as of right now.\n\nThe point that I am trying to make here is that investing in MAC today is much safer than investing in other popular short squeeze candidates. Regardless of what happens in the short run, we think that an investment in MAC will do well in the long run. We cannot say the same thing about GameStop, BlackBerry, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, or even AMC.\n\nReason #3: The Short Thesis is Falling Apart and a Number of Catalysts Could Force the Short Squeeze\n\nAs of right now, MAC is one of the most heavily shorted stocks in the world.\n\nIt is so heavily shorted because it is a highly leveraged mall REIT in the midst of a pandemic. Put simply, the short thesis is that malls are dying and MAC's covenant breach could force it to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.\n\nThese are legitimate risks to consider, but our recent shows that MAC's covenant situation is unlikely to pose an issue, and our long-term outlook for MAC's high-quality malls is very positive.\n\nMeanwhile, vaccinations are now well underway and the world is quickly returning back to normal, causing the short thesis to fall apart.\n\nEven then, MAC is still trading at a significant discount to fair value.\n\nThis is made evident by the fact that MAC's two closest peers (Taubman Centers (TCO &amp; Brookfield Property Partners (BPY)) are being bought out by other players. MAC is now the last remaining pure-play Class A mall REIT, and it is a prime target for a buyout and/or short squeeze. In fact, a large private equity firm bought a 6.8% stake in 2020, and more recently, it filled a 13-D with an amendment that allows them to acquire up to 14.9% of the equity.\n\n&gt;**Are they currently buying shares? Is this why MAC is rising? Are they preparing a buy-out?**\n\nWe don't know.\n\nBut what we do know is that MAC is extremely heavily shorted, deeply discounted, profitable, and things will only get better from here as the world returns to normal.\n\nWith all of that in mind, the risk-to-reward of shorting MAC is deteriorating even from a fundamental perspective.\n\nBottom Line\n\nIt offers similar potential as all the other popular short squeeze candidates (GameStop, BlackBerry, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, AMC), but the difference is that MAC actually has a real business with significant underlying value and recurrent cash flow.\n\nDisclaimer this is not investment advice do your own research",

        "selftext": "  Just wanted to say you are my favorite broker and it's been tough sending you business once you turned off fractionals for GameStop and possibly other shares. I think it's pretty weak if that was your decision to do so.\n\nThere's a lot of people flooding to your business and your mobile app now because of this subreddit. Even though the UI for your mobile app is pretty bad compared to ROBEMGOOD.\n\nAs a suggestion could you possibly open fractional investing up for people with the minimum deposit required to open an account with you? $100. Or maybe allocate a little of your large amount of shares for these retail investors?\n\nThere's a lot of people who would like to buy fractional shares in these companies you turned off and they have the right to do so. You were offering this option before. When everything went down and people couldn't buy shares you turned that option off.\n\nIf there's a reason these retail investors can't buy fractional shares, can you at least release an announcement as to why that is? And don't bullshit us?\n\nIf you have already turned the option back on, please disregard. With your Quick Ticket system that you have to use in order to buy fractional shares, you can't place an order until market opens.  So I haven't been able to check since Friday and it was still off. \n\nHere's an article from Reuters you posted that says ROBEMGOOD still isn't offering fractional shares.\n\nNeither was Fidelity last I checked even though I tested it prior to the whole fiasco and it worked. \n\n[https://www.fidelity.com/news/article/top-news/202101281910RTRSNEWSCOMBINED\\_KBN29X12T-OUSBS\\_1](https://www.fidelity.com/news/article/top-news/202101281910RTRSNEWSCOMBINED_KBN29X12T-OUSBS_1)\n\nDisclaimer: Not an advisor just think it's kind of shitty to turn off an option for investors with smaller amounts of capitol, unless you were forced by regulators to do so.  Then it's the regulators who are shitty. Unless there is no more actual shares to buy and that doesn't seem to be the case. What's going on with that?",

        "selftext": "First of all, major credit to u/johnnydaggers for the [original DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/) If you haven't read that yet, go take a look.\n\nInspired by his analysis, I wanted to investigate the SEC's publicly available Failed to Deliver data and see how it compared to other companies over time.\n\nI wrote some code to process the the raw SEC data and normalize the shares that failed to deliver by the total number of outstanding shares of the company. This gives us a view that where each company's FTD shares are expressed as a percentage of the outstanding, so we can fairly compare companies to one another.\n\n(Before you ask, yes I account for fluctuating values of outstanding shares.)\n\nI went back to the beginning of 2019, looking at a few of the recent meme stocks with short squeezes as well as the top 10 (by weight) in the S&amp;P 500 as well as GE (as an example of a stock with very low short interest). Here's what I found.\n\n[This is not normal.](https://preview.redd.it/9us7kdme1ue61.png?width=2554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ddf843285adac642c3d15360c71e14ed04566a38)\n\nShares can fail to deliver for many reasons, but when large numbers of shares fail to deliver a likely explanation is naked short selling. For a thorough explanation of this, see [this article](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html).\n\nBack in early 2019, both GME and AMC look like the others. All had sub-1% of their outstanding shares end up as FTD. But starting in mid 2019, both GME and AMC experienced three waves of progressively larger naked short selling attacks. This is known as [scaling in](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/scale-in.asp).\n\nI wanted to see if I could find corroborating evidence of news and price data which aligned in time with these waves of naked shorting. What I found were two stories, both similar, explaining how GME and AMC got to where they are today.\n\n# GameStop\n\nThe first wave (small bet) of naked shorts occurred in June and July of 2019. GME reported Q1 '19 earnings on June 4th after hours, with a [bleak future outlook](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/06/05/gamestop-stock-plunges-nearly-percent-gamers-brace-new-era-consoles/). Overall sales was down $1.5B, net income plunged by 78%. This story is what formed the core of the bear thesis. The stock dropped 36% on the news.\n\n[GME Q1 '19 Earnings. Oof.](https://preview.redd.it/vbrosels1ue61.png?width=2804&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b04f103567aa52b8af929191f14fbae86a41f0e4)\n\nBut things changed when Q2 '19 earnings came around. Yes, sales were down again and the numbers didn't look good, but the company announced it was going to [reboot with a major strategic update](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/09/10/1913815/0/en/GameStop-Reports-Second-Quarter-Fiscal-2019-Results.html). They were going to make their retail stores more efficient by closing some locations, focus on becoming a social hub for gaming, and build a digital platform around the relaunched GameStop website.\n\nInvestors liked the news and the stock tries to move upwards, but is repeatedly beaten down. This lines up with the second wave of naked shorting. The original short sellers couldn't let the price float up, so they resorted to more than doubling down on their original naked short bet to keep the stock trending downward.\n\n[Naked Shorts double down, gotta drive it to zero faster than they can rebuild!](https://preview.redd.it/p6x5x8zw1ue61.png?width=2772&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=382b78b87a737dc480f85bccea573096ca681706)\n\nFinally COVID hits the US in March and April. Lockdowns happen and it becomes clear that nobody is going to malls anytime soon. This is where the third and final massive wave of naked short selling happens, attempting to push GME into bankruptcy. Remember, that's always the goal with naked short selling. If the company goes bankrupt, especially with a convenient parallel story (\"It was a failing company anyway and COVID was the nail in the coffin!\"), then nobody bothers to look into how many counterfeit shares might be floating around out there. They aren't worth anything, so who cares!\n\nAt its peak, **over 20% of the company's entire outstanding shares were failing to deliver every month**. This is confirmed by a tweet from Michael Burry (since deleted, he scrubs his tweets) that says when he tried to recall his lent-out shares, it took his broker **many weeks** to locate them. Remember, companies normally have well below 1% of their outstanding shares fail to deliver every month.\n\n# AMC Entertainment\n\nTo understand how we got here with AMC, you need to look back further, to 2017. AMC has been struggling to be profitable for a while. They had a history of posting very small net profits along with many net losses. Their cash on hand was hovering around $300M and their corporate borrowing had been going up.\n\n[Trying to hard to not lose money.](https://preview.redd.it/g7zugy792ue61.png?width=1876&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f580cf12bad13197ed1426466d8b183a4191933e)\n\n[Surely borrowing will make this problem go away!](https://preview.redd.it/jtgjqlu92ue61.png?width=1876&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93a8ac04fd426390354024ce016a2a08df36c79f)\n\nWhat coincided with the first small naked short bet on AMC in June/July of 2019? Their cash on hand just dipped below $200M (from being stable around $300m). The last time that happened, AMC more than doubled its corporate loans. The short hedge funds smelled blood in the water.\n\nThe second bet, where the naked shorts doubled down occurred in November of 2019. What happened then? AMC Q3 earnings, which showed that cash on hand had dropped to a precipitous $100M. Bankruptcy was in sight for the hedge funds...\n\nAnd then COVID hit. Their massive third wave bet was similar to GameStop, though slightly more delayed. Why? May 2020 was the peak of naked short selling, around the time when some businesses were able to reopen with restrictions, but it was clear that **movie theaters**, among a few other things, would be staying closed until the pandemic was completely over.\n\nAlso like GameStop, at its peak **over 20% of the company's outstanding shares were failing to deliver**. This is not normal.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nI think the evidence shows there is a strong reason to believe that one or more hedge funds, probably in collusion with broker dealers or the DTCC, have been deliberately naked short selling both GME and AMC since mid-2019. They made small bets to start with in the first wave, doubled down a few months later, but stupidly went all-in for the kill when COVID hit the US. It presented a unique scapegoat that nobody would question for pushing a failing mall retailer and a dwindling movie chain out of business.\n\nWhere does this leave us? I don't know. Unless this results in some kind of economic crisis (and I'm beginning to think it will), I don't see anything getting seriously investigated or changing. This is the same crap that happened with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2008, but nobody was went to jail for it. Of course they were going to keep doing it.\n\n**This is not financial advice. I eat crayons and paste.**\n\nPositions: 100 GME @ $36, 500 AMC @ $2.75 (but I wrote $3 calls before it mooned... GUH)\n\nIf anyone wants to play around with the code or data I used to generate the first plot (monthly normalized failure to deliver data), [I put it on GitHub](https://github.com/bobsomers/evidence_of_naked_short_fraud_in_gme_and_amc).",

AMC, though it is shorted, it is no where near to the level of GME. don't expect it to rise at the same rate. it is a good stock for the long term, if you want quick gains and are willing to take a risk, BUY GME INSTEAD. \n\njust saying this as there are a lot of misconceptions that any stock can be like GME if people band together. that is not the case, GME is a very unique situation and it's conditions probably wont be replicated again in our lifetime, assuming wall street learns their lesson. \n\nand the gme short squeeze HAS NOT HAPPENED YET idk why people think it's too late to buy. $1000 per share is very conservative at this point once the squeeze happens.\n\nthis came out kinda preachy but if your really trying to moon and hurt wall street going all in into GME is the best choice rn. if your looking for a more long term stock then ignore this, AMC is great.",

        "selftext": "Since I wrote a comment with some news as people seems confused on the NOK play and the catalysts, it might as well serve as a DD for new people and interested people in NOK.\n\nKeep in mind that NOK (as others) is getting much hate from greedy boys that are autistically focused on GME only. This is for people who have a long view. We remember that when GME was 4 dollars to 9 dollars, we got the same hate and trolls.

NOK is NOT a short squeeze and a totally different play from GME.\n\nNOK could be an undervalued stock with much room for growth, but I am just a retard so no financial advice here indeed.

Another fact: on 27th january Volume was up 3400% and billions of shares were traded, the price jumped to 9 and back to 6 and would have been there if NOK wasn't put under restrictions. If this was possible in 1 single day of trading, what could happen in normal conditions in a medium-long term?\n\nAlso, Ericcson has 3B float shares and the price is at 12.50. Nokia is at 4.5 now.\n\nBB was at 9 and went to 24 in a week before restrictions. There is PLENTY of potential room for growth for NOK, which is a solid player, and million of traders traded billion of share in one single day already.\n\nTL;DR Nokia is a great opportunity for having a stock that is cheap and has potential to grow. It is NOT a short squeeze but a normal company growing with moon potential (fucking LITERALLY). \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nEDIT - corrected typos and adding this post which had even more news&amp;rumors I was not aware of:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Nok/comments/la3ak2/i\\_just\\_called\\_nokia\\_customer\\_servicethey\\_asked\\_me/?utm\\_medium=android\\_app&amp;utm\\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nok/comments/la3ak2/i_just_called_nokia_customer_servicethey_asked_me/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)  \n\n\nEDIT2 - recent great DD on wsb with news about bullish sentiment, positions of top investors and other, EPS updates and other:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lafy84/nokia\\_nok\\_is\\_bad\\_idea\\_not\\_really\\_its\\_brilliant/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lafy84/nokia_nok_is_bad_idea_not_really_its_brilliant/)",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone!\n\nI spent the weekend looking for good opportunities to flip wall street. I set out looking for stocks that have good technicals to pull off a GME style short squeeze. I think DMC Global Inc, trading as BOOM (yep, that really is the ticker), is our best play. Here is why.\n\nTo find a play, I am looking for companies that are way over shorted, that aren\u2019t too big and that could be squeezed by a WSB onslaught. I looked for these things:\n\n1. Stock where there is **more than 100% institutional hold**, which indicates naked short selling\n2. Stock where there is **more than 15% of float that is openly shorted**, these are shares that have been borrowed and shorted.\n3. Stock with a **reasonable market cap** so we can move it, smaller is better here.\n4. Any other factors revealed by a review of the company.\n\nI am not an investment advisor and I am not giving any investment advice. #DYOR I have an MBA and know how markets work. I\u2019m a geek who got into coding and finance in high school and working and investing for more than 20 years. I bought my first Jag with investment gains and people asked if I was old enough to drive it! I also got screwed over multiple times by banks and institutional investors. In 2008, I lost 3 years of my hard work investing when a broker closed out some of my positions at the worst possible crashing moment (to protect me!) and left me holding a bag of shit. I watched my broker front run my trades. When started with OTC, I saw them settle their prop desk\u2019s least favorable trades of the day to me. Robinhood didn\u2019t invent this stuff. If you\u2019re in this to change Wall Street, let\u2019s break their trades and take back the markets.\n\nFirst, I think targeting companies like Nokia is a bad idea. **NOK has a market cap of 25.6 billion and not enough shorts on it. It will be very hard to move such a monster. BB is another case with few shorts and almost 9bil mkt cap.** AMC with a cap of 4.5 billion is already a challenge. GME was around 2 billion when we started this and it\u2019s 22 billion now - very hard to hold at this level. We have to ask: **\u201cHow big is this challenge - a mountain or a boulder?\u201d and \u201cWho\u2019s on the other side of  the trade and how deep?\u201d** Keep these questions in mind before we move.\n\nSecondly, **this is not long term investing** \\- we are playing a hard game vs. wall street. It\u2019s about momentum and trade positions. Company data doesn\u2019t matter: EPS, EBITDA, cash flow - it doesn\u2019t matter for a short squeeze trade. With GME, we have given the company a great opportunity to raise funds and pivot, but its future depends on management. We bankrupted Melvin. That is our achievement. Our goal is hitting the crooks on the other side of these trades: Citadel, SAC, Robinhood, etc. The company is just the football in this game.\n\nTwo interesting companies are Teradata Corp and Allogene Therapeutics Inc. These are short squeeze opportunities as well. TDC, has a 105.98% institutional and a 19.46% short interest with a cap of 2.9billion. TDC is almost 4x bigger than BOOM, so it will be harder to move with lower beta and a lower institutional so moves will have less impact. ALLO, has a 61.46% institutional and a 19.52% short interest with a cap of 4.9billion. Price action is not aggressive either but Allogen 8x bigger than BOOM and could be much harder to move.\n\nAfter looking at these and several other candidates, I found the best option, one that I believe could be successful in less than 3 days. It is DMC Global Inc. (NASDAQ:BOOM)\n\n1. **DMC has 114.49% institutional hold** \\- this means that there are hedge funds that have big short positions on this stock, many of which are naked. Naked shorts create the phantom shares representing 15% more than the float. Naked short is when you short the stock and the lender who let you short sell the stock actually didn\u2019t deliver the stock to you. This creates phantom shares. *Let me say that again:* there are 115% of the issued shares in play, that extra 15% in play *does not exist, but is owed*. These shares have been short sold without actually having shares to sell.\n2. **DMC has 17.46% Short Interest**, so pretty heavily shorted. This means that pushing the stock up will squeeze that like a big zit on a small face.  This is way bigger % than NOK and BB who have a little zit on a big face.\n3. **The market cap is just around 1 billion**. It won\u2019t take huge volume to squeeze this one.\n4. Other interesting features are a) **beta of 1.3**. The stock historically moves more than the market and b) recent price moves are up, but the **stock hasn\u2019t had any crazy big run**, so there is a lot of room to push this up really fast. c) fyi: DMC has a real business manufacturing metal parts and accessories using explosives for the energy industry,\n5. **It trades under ticker BOOM. This is a poetic bonus for this story.**\n\nAfter looking at these and lots of others. I concluded that the best play is BOOM, it\u2019s just like a ripe cherry waiting to be picked. I can find no better chance of success than this: a perfectly sized company that is as leveraged and as owned by hedgies as this. **I put this out for everyone and let the WSB mods decide.** The situation won\u2019t stay like this for long in these volatile markets, so if we decide to act, it must be now. Let\u2019s make this week another one for the history books. This is our moment. Let\u2019s change the world, one BOOM at a time!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Edit**: Position long: GME, BOOM, G bee tee cee, NO SHORTS and NO UNDIES EITHER.",

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nWith the price of Silver going up (I'm not going to speculate on whether there is a short squeeze), there are a lot of silver companies who's price mimic that of silver. \n\nI've done a lot of research to figure out which companies are being missed and I think I found a winner.\n\nIntegra Resources ($ITRG) is a Canadian mining company that's been growing lately. It started on the Toronto Stock Exchange and now has a foothold in the United States. It's price is currently at $3.26, but it has been following the price of silver since it's been public. \n\nThis is a small cap company (197 million), but it's spent the past year expanding its operations in silver mines. It's even gone on to acquire a large positions (5%+) in an old established Mining company that's seen better days ($CDE, used to be $200 - $300 WAY back in the day, currently trades at $11.85). I personally believe that there will be an acquisition or merger between these two companies at some point in the future.\n\nThough most silver companies are following in step with Silver, this one is lagging behind. With silver jumping over the weekend, this company hasn't moved pre-market, but it should catch up within the next day or so. At the rate that it's followed silver, I believe that a $6 or $7 target by the end of the month is doable. I believe this is the value play on the silver pump.\n\nPositions - 78 shares at $3.37.

        "selftext": "So I'm still new to investing and had extra money saved and wanted to be apart of this stock market history so I bought a GME share - ON LIKE 4AM MONDAY - at $312 as a Market Order, but I was wondering if I should cancel it and instead use a limit order, because I don't know how Market orders work exactly. My question is, even though I was under the assumption I bought my share at/around an exact price of $312, if the markets open and it's at - for example - gets to $400, does that mean I would have bought the share at $400 when the stock market actually opens, or would it still be around the $312 of when I bought it during before/aftermarket hours?",

        "selftext": "I'm not financially well versed; I get that people are hyped up about the GME short squeeze where hedge funds who shorted the stock have to cover their positions, and start buying back shares thus driving up demand and prices. The alternative is that they dont cover and they get charged a crazy amount of interest by their brokers. Either way they go bankrupt. But what if they choose the alternative route, out of spite, to stick it to the retail investors?\n\nWhat is the liklihood of that happening? Also I heard that there isn't a set date on when the hedge funds are going to be asked by their brokers to cover, right? So it could be today, tommorow, next week, next month, right? So essentially this squeeze, if it occurs, can happen any time?",

        "selftext": "\\[Update\\] Posting here  \\[WSBN\\] as WSB did not allow me to.\n\n\\[Update 2\\] Do not listen to news that talk about Silver or any other catalyst. It is part of their distraction plan. Expect DIPS, BIG DIPs. Understand that they will try to scare the hell out of us and bring it as low as possible.\n\nLink to [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/l7po3s/situation_from_europe_plan_for_next_days_and/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFellow retards,\n\nAllow me to keep sharing my thoughts with you as it clears my mind and it gives me a path forward.\n\nAlso, I see that a lot of people lost here, missing basic knowledge on the stock market. I hope this adds a new perspective that helps you grow as a trader.\n\nNow, first, understand that I am in no way giving you any financial advise. You must do your own DD, understand your financial situation and take decisions based on your own research. I am just an autist that is most likely wrong so you should just read this for fun.\n\n## What to take into account on the current bet\n\nThere are three pillars in the current trade\n\n* Owners of stocks holding\n   * This caps how many shares are available, causing lack of liquidity (necessary for a short squeeze)\n* High Short interest remaining  (30-50+M)\n   * Main requirement for a short squeeze\n* Buys strength (retailer or institutional)\n   * To keep removing liquidity and pushing the price up (which triggers a gamma and short squeeze)\n\n# Short interest (SI) situation\n\nThis section is going to be complex, there is a lot of ground to cover, but hopefully you will get my point.\n\n## What we DO know\n\nSI is published every 15 days. The last time NYSE released GME SI data was on Jan 15th. All the information in between is based on different algorithms that companies such as ORTEX and S3Partners. These results might be wrong.\n\nAs of 15th of January the data was: 61.78m Shorts - 131.76%\n\n[FYI, DTC is totally misleading for GME. Ignore that number](https://preview.redd.it/2xrzp52g3ue61.png?width=349&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa27ab67688a290b0984144a3105e6902a9b76a8)\n\nNext time we will hear about SI will be on the **9th of February** [according to the NYSE calendar](https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/data/NYSE_Group_Short_Interest_Calendar.pdf). Remember this date for later.\n\n# Jan 22-29th RECAP - Understand where do we stand before setting expectations for next week\n\n**JAN 22-26th** AFAIK, a fair amount of -old- Shorts were covered on the squeeze that happened on Jan 25th and 26th (Tuesday) which helped rocket GME price from $50 to $250.\n\n[The first 350M volume was followed by an avg. of 145M+ the next two day. It is likely that many Short positions closed](https://preview.redd.it/f1ip3z2l3ue61.png?width=882&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f30113682c228e83904fc28a9877314f1b214ff3)\n\nNow, those Shorts, according to Ortex and S3Partners were replaced with new ones too. Something that -according to me- it is quite reasonable, as we will see below.\n\n**JAN 27-29th** On Jan 27th (Wed) after our friend Elon tweeted GameStonks!, New opened Shorts positions trembled. The MarketMaker(MM) forced to cover Call options as the price skyrocket (gamma squeeze) and Shorts covering pushed the price from $220 to $380.\n\nJan 26th aside, I believe the 27th was the biggest retail day with massive internet coverage and stock purchases.\n\n[Week event - Melvin Capital could say whatever, I do not believe it, and even if I would, well, as sure as hell they reopened new shorts \\(them or others\\)](https://preview.redd.it/i6b61z6w3ue61.png?width=753&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=418599684c1ca7179a990ada9ef7565e4bccdbcd)\n\nWe cannot be certain of how many Shorts remained after the market closed on Jan 27th (Wed). Regardless, with such home-run, **the HUGE squeeze was imminent.** Do not be fooled, there was no other legit reason to close retail traffic on Jan 28th when the price hit $500 (check what my best friend ever [IBKR Thomas P.](https://streamable.com/ycdec9)  said about it).\n\nThis makes me believe that at least 40+M shorts were still hanging in there.\n\n## WowowW, but wait, What happened with the volume?\n\nThe volume has massively gone down **and I take that as a real dam good sign**. From the initial 350M we have gone down to the 25M as of Friday 29th.\n\nOn Thursday, the short ladders had barely 2-4M in volume. Day volume was 34M.\n\nThis -to me- means that Retail might own a bigger chunk of the pie than we expected. **Easy 20M shares that Retail Holds and no way is going to fucking sell.**\n\n# So now what? What is the Short Interest situation?\n\nIf there is something that I have learn from the last days research is this: **SHORT INTEREST DATA is** \\- for GME most likely - **MANIPULATED.**\n\nIn the past week, we have seen nasty plays. Short ladders, retailers blocked from buying, and fake news and now... -in my opinion- short positions estimation manipulation.\n\nLong story short, I have seen a sudden HUGE change on the short interest estimates out of the blue on both ORTEX and S3Partners. Luckily, S3Partners had been very vocal and very public about the news related to short positions which has helped me consolidate the idea that currrent estimates are bullshit.\n\nIn less than 12h, S3Partners has gone from  their ***Hey mates! we still see 58+M shorts!\"*** to ***\"Well, markets are fluid and I am not gonna give you any data but be scared because a lot of Shorts are closed\"***. This [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356017621649383426) is pretty pathetic/fun to read.\n\n# Play for the next 2 weeks\n\nDuring the past week, you thought you sweated and shitted your pants like a master and, over everything else, you consider yourself a \ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32. Well, you are not, at least, not yet.\n\n## Shorts play - How I think they will manipulate Retai\n\nHere is the thing. If I were them, what would I do? I would have covered as many shorts as possible as low as possible by Friday 29th and would have made special deals so I can keep my game on.\n\nThe first week of February I would open a shit ton of new Shorts because I know that people, as much as they call themselves retards, on the deep inside they are paper hands and they will sell as the time passes.\n\nThen on the 9th with the next Short Interest NYSE report showing 20-30M shorts and all reddit full of bots giving the news of the Armageddon, all of Retail will run to hit the sell to market button as the explosive diarrea ruins their ergonomic gamer chairs and few of them make 3 or 4 bucks.\n\nAnd Retail fools will be left holding the bags while I would recover all the money I have lost in the previous weeks/squeezes as the price sinks to $2\n\n**THINK!!!** If you were them, would you not open shorts like a fucking demon at top prices? 420, 500, 470, 350, 320. We have seen many resistance points with plenty of volume and we have not really broken it.\n\nThey have 2 top opportunities to win. Sink the price next week so everyone sells or control the price raise until the new NYSE report comes out and gives bad news.\n\nIf I had to bet, I would say they will do both.\n\nLook at this: MUST VIEW: [`https://www.youtube.com/embed/QFfjX8dW-QQ`](https://www.youtube.com/embed/QFfjX8dW-QQ)\n\n## But mate, Is Retail big enough to keep this going?\n\nA big chunk of GameStop is owned by Blackrock and other huge wales. They are going to be rich as fuck and yes, they can do deals under the table. So what.\n\nBy no short of imagination -according to my estimates- they can prevent the squeeze from happening. Retail owns at least 20+M shares. I have seen numbers that say that retail only owns 13%. NO WAY. Last week, 500k-1M+  people jumped into GME. Some buying fractions, some buying few stocks and some buying tens or hundreds.\n\n**Even at a low average of 20 Retail easily owns 15M-20M+ shares .**  Taking into account the shares owned by funds that GME just as part of the portfolio and the insider ownership, my estimate is that **there are around 20-30M shares available to trade.**  Do not be fooled by the volume. The same stock could be traded 10 times, still one stock cannot close 10 shorts.\n\n## What will I do\n\nThis is war. Personally, I am financially strong. I doubled my account in the past 6 months so I keep having money to through at this.\n\nI'll continue to Buy DIPs and HOLD and I will be very careful to believe the information that is published that it is not official and based on estimates. \"Information\" is the wales game. They play it however they want, so better use some logic -like the one above- to understand how to play my cards.\n\nAll the people around me, tell me I am fucking crazy. That I should get the gains or put a stop loss. But being a trader is going against what other think or do. Is about having your dam plan clear, based on your believes an executing it.\n\n## Exit strategy\n\nI am more and more inclined to just do some \ud83c\udf7fseat-back and watch how it keeps climbing. Now, there will be dips as the rocket refuels, but there ain't stopping it. Maybe sell some at 15k? This is so big, that I have no idea.\n\nIf it SINKs, I'll just never sell, I'll pass them to my sons when I die with the promise that they will never sell.\n\n## Interactive brokers Update\n\nTaking into account how much they have fucked me already, I trust them shit. Should I have had paper hands I will be out of the game long ago (I could not buy again until Friday, where I bought in the last minutes).\n\nFor Europe, I fear there is no real alternative. So, braze yourselves.\n\n## Final disclaimer\n\nDo not follow what I said here, just because you liked it. Do you DD, understand you financial situation and do not fuck yourself over a bet. As probable as it might seem there is always a chance for all to go to shit. Do not allow yourself to be in a bankrupt risk.\n\nI am not a financial advisor, I do not have the knowledge nor do I want to be one. I am simply sharing my thoughts, but I can be completely wrong and it would not be the first time. Be safe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know in the comments if you have any correction or additional information and I will keep this post up to date.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/user/DeepFuckingValue/) In the name of those who will YOLO, we salut you.\n\nREF: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l78uct/gme\\_yolo\\_update\\_jan\\_28\\_2021/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l78uct/gme_yolo_update_jan_28_2021/)\n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32 and fucking GME \ud83d\ude80 to Alpha centaury.",

        "selftext": "Turquiose hill resources a already profitable leveraged copper miner is one of the most valuable copper miners on the planet plagued with uncertainty, government, corporate, and media interference.\n\nThe stock currently trades around .2 book value.  The most recent Q3 2020 earnings was GAAP EPS of $0.64 and the stock is trading around $11. Meanwhile FCX one of the largest copper miners posted a Q4 2020 GAAP EPS of $0.48 and trades around $28. This means TRQ is trading at a 300% discount relative to earnings and Q3 copper prices were much lower than Q4.\n\nA quick look at TRQ stock price has indicated it has been on a 10 year downtrend.  The company is a single asset copper miner located in Mongolia which has a decent production on its open pit mine and is developing Oyu Tolgoi, an expansive very deep underground mine the size of Manhattan that will start sustainable production on October 2022 and eventually make it the 3rd/4th largest lowest cost producer copper mine on the planet when ramped up over the following years.\n\nSo why has the performance of the stock been in the dumps even when copper and gold are near all time highs? There are a couple of factors making the stock trade at just 20% of book value. \n\n1. Government of Mongolia (GoM) and its constant trashing of the the Oyu Tolgoi.  GoM made a deal to have 33.3% equity stake in the mine but didn\u2019t have money so they borrowed it. The mine is one of largest inflow of foreign direct investment ever negotiated and in the last decade loss out on the bet as copper and gold were in a bear market.  The expansion of the underground mine also significantly expensive and over budgeted have given ammo to the fire of trashing all the international agreements that they want to negotiate.  Every other year there are presidential or parliamentary elections and they trash the investment putting constant pressure on the TRQ stock. Currently a presidential election is taking place in June 2021 and the debate on Mongolians getting ripped off has heated up with politicians and citizens feel like they are being cheated. They compare their asset to the great riches of Saudi princes, which is not a fair comparison as oil has been in decades long Bull market\n\n2. Sometime in the early decade Rio Tinto was able to purchase the majority of TRQ shares to get a controlling interest in the company but decided not to pay a premium on the rest of the company.  RIO became the project manager for the Oyu Tolgoi mine. Meanwhile TRQ was systematically turned into a shell company of RIO by removing all former employees and replacing the board with hand picked Ex-RIO executives. RIO had no interest in defending the stock when GoM tensions flared up as this decreased  the value of TRQ and had no interest in negotiating with GoM as this benefitted their end goal of getting TRQ for free. Analyst several years ago thought that TRQ would be bought out by RIO to increase their copper and diversify away from Iron Ore revenues.  In July 2019 it was announce that there was a funding shortfall of 1.9 B and a 30 month delay.  This caused the stock to trash amazingly which has not yet recovered.  As momentum started building in September 2020 RIO revealed their end goal of acquiring TRQ, by attempting to limit the amount of debt TRQ could issue as well as request for the funding gap to be covered by a share offering which RIO would backstop. TRQ already had an ability under the agreements issue up to an additional 1.6 B debt but RIO was seeking to limit it to 500 M. \n\n3. Due to the delay in the launch of the mine by 22 months and the funding gap the stock faces liquidity risk uncertainty. RIO manufactured a crisis by trying to limit debt that TRQ could raise. This caused TRQ to see RIO as an existential threat and they have since launched financing arbitration in Canada which is friendly to minority shareholders. TRQ had announce today that RIO was trying to pre empt the financing arbitration decision by trying to pursue financing options that would limit TRQ\u2019s ability to finance their preferred options. TRQ had filed an injunction to stop RIO.\n\n4. Financial Times has taken the side of the TRQ short seller Odey and has multiple times crashed the stock through unethical journalism.  Odey even in 2020 was able to feed a nonsense open letter article that triggered a 10% crash.\n\nGoM a democracy due to their free speech and Oyu Tolgoi bashing has created downward pressure on the stock.  Most of the speech is rubbish but money is scared especially when dealing with an untested emerging market.  This has caused Oyu Tolgoi to be the only major investment in Mongolia and it already accounts for 1/3rd of their economy.  They seek to change the international iron clad agreements, which due to RIOs new management might receive some concessions.\n\nRIO a hostile controlling shareholder has successfully through years of TRQ pain caused investors to discount the stock at just .2 of book value despite gold and copper near all time highs. They had Temasak Singapore sovereign wealth fund liquidate and take considerable losses over a billion dollars. \nThey had Sailingstone which went all in TRQ turn a 5B hedge fund to a 250 M hedge fund. In my opinion RIO has done just as much damage as GoM.\n\nThe history of TRQ is important as to the context of why the stock is trading at such a depressed value.   Going forward as the underground mine nears completion the facts are:\n\n1. TRQ is extremely profitable at these commodity prices.  The amounts are projected to be able to fund the remaining capital investments and still be cash flow positive.\n\n2. TRQ date of which cash will be depleted keeps getting pushed back as commodity prices remain strong currently their estimate is Q2 2022. RIOs plan to get TRQ shares for free are almost certain to fail. Financing Arbitration should de-risk liquidity. Once this happens the price will increase multiple folds and the RIO buyout may become an option. \n\n3. TRQ has broken pact with RIO and has taken GoM side and voted for an independent investigation on the cost overrun and disagreed with RIO criteria to be met by GoM in order to continue key milestones of underground mining development.\n\n4. TRQ will soon benefit from a decade long continued copper growth production at the lowest cost curve quartile. At current commodity prices the mines NPV discounted at 8% is 15B as quoted from last years OTTR report which is available on their website.\n\nDespite the massive upcoming copper growth of TRQ and the huge discount the stock is trading at investors are trigger happy and sell when any type of news hits the stock.  The stock may be a roller coaster for the next few months but the trend is clear, the underground mine is almost complete, copper and gold continue to be near all time highs and TRQ is extremely profitable and well run mine with lowest injury rate and a 90% plus Mongolian workforce. To get to book value the stock will rise 4x and most stocks of this size trade at multiples of book value.\n\nDisclosure: I am long TRQ",

        "selftext": "Morning folks, I come in peace. I hope non GME stock talk is ok this week, if not, please let me know. I'm *much* more of a guns/ammo guy than a stock guy, so I was hoping some of you fine folks could shed some light on this for me. A few months ago, I realized **Barnes Bullets and Sierra Bullets had been purchased by Clarus Corp (CLAR)**. Obviously I didn't realize it when they were acquired, but I did remember a bit of supply disruption last year, which is why I was poking around. Now I know people love their guns and ammo stocks with Biden in office, but why is CLAR the red-headed stepchild in all this in terms of interest and stock price when compared with OLN POWW and VSTO? Sorry I don't have any market knowledge to share with you guys, but Sierra is well represented on my reloading bench and their bullets are definitely hard to find over here. They also make loaded ammunition (ready to shoot) which is also sold out everywhere. Barnes is an extremely well known component maker for reloaders as well. Does this company have room to run?",

        "selftext": "Over the weekend, it\u2019s become clear that restrictions on Robinhood\u2019s margin requirements for settling transactions with clearinghouses was the primary reason why buying in some stocks were and are restricted.\n\nI\u2019m not suggesting lube wasn\u2019t also used or not used between Citadel and Robinhood, but this technical liquidity requirement is a big deal. It\u2019s also important to remember that Robinhood is a startup and the demand in our prized GME and AMC was a shock to multiple brokerages.\n\nHERE IS THE POINT: Our movement is driven by retail investors, and Robinhood is the home to the greatest volume of dating trading retail investors. Based on a conversation in Clubhouse yesterday, it appears that Robinhood has addressed their liquidity issues and should be able to unrestrict the stocks soon.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re on Robinhood, get ready to buy and BUY THE INEVITABLE DIP CAUSED BY ARTIFICIAL BUY RESTRICTIONS.\n\nBecause as soon as restrictions are lifted, the #1 stock trading app in the world for retail traders will effectively be lifting capital costs currently impacting many billions of dollars that would be flying into AMC and GME right now. \n\nYou are also very encouraged to transition your funds to other platforms in order to benefit from artificially low pricing. Because, even if our prized stonks appreciate 250% over the next couple days, you can know that most \ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d don\u2019t know how to change brokerages and it will at least take time.\n\nYOU NEED TO HOLD \ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\ude4c , because our movement\u2019s capital is artificially restricted for the moment or is in the middle of relocating to other brokerages.\n\nAND DON\u2019T PANIC. \ud83e\udd8d can breathe on the \ud83c\udf1a.",

        "selftext": "**Stocks end their worst week since October at their lowest point on Friday. Is the Short-Squeeze Over? Over 100 companies report earnings this week. Let\u2019s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of Friday as we saw the stock market finish with another sell-off, as the big 3 indices finished with the worst week since late October with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Vpq92y3) losing almost 2%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/yN3b3RQ) losing exactly 2% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/D7Cy2YQ) shedding 620 points and dropping below 30k. All 3 of them finished the week down more than 3% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/cgz4N3r) spiked yet again on Friday, rising by almost 10% and finishing the week up more than 40%.\n\nWe saw over 70% of the companies declining [Friday](https://ibb.co/G3rX22D), as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average dropped under 50%, with all 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/HKhY6hC) finishing in the red again, as Energy &amp; Tech were the biggest losers. \n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/jVFqVbH). It\u2019s really hard to find any gaining companies, with big tech companies selling off yet again, as most of the small gainers were found in the Health Care sector. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/5Y5HR4q)  though, Microsoft was the only big tech name that managed to gain ground after smashing the earnings report, while most of the stock market faced sell-off pressures as the short squeeze mania might have pushed investors into a risk-off approach.\n\nWe also got some economic data on Friday as the December personal disposable [INCOME](https://ibb.co/Khyh7mP) increase by 0.6%, more than expected as this mostly reflected an increase in social benefits &amp; compensations, with the Q4 employment cost [INDEX](https://ibb.co/QcqbM5y) also rising by 0.7% to close out the year.\n\nMeanwhile we saw the Consumer Sentiment [INDEX](https://ibb.co/pX3mFgt) coming in at 79, slightly lower than expected, as this was also seen in the December pending home sales [NUMBER](https://ibb.co/m4tbnWN), which also came in with a 0.3% decrease month/month.\n\nThis week we have somewhat of a quiet economic [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v), with a couple of interesting numbers through the week, while [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/rxmpwVK) take center stage yet again, with interesting reports coming from companies like Amazon, Google &amp; Alibaba on Tuesday, while Wednesday we hear from PayPal, Qualcomm &amp; Spotify. We also get earnings reports from some recent favorites like Pinterest, Snap, Ford, Peloton and Penn on Thursday as the earnings season with over 100 companies from the SP500 reporting, might help push the stock market higher after the sell-off last week.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/C0CSdJJ) reporting a new monthly record with 7225 vehicles delivered in the first month of 2021, an increase of more than 350% Y/Y as the company is still ramping up production in an attempt to challenge Tesla\u2019s EV dominance. Nio has had a huge run in the past months but has a long way to go to grow into the big valuation, though the trajectory of the company looks very promising.\n\nMeanwhile the biggest development in the markets was the trading platforms [imposing](https://ibb.co/y5sPVJv) restrictions on the squeezed stocks and even many other stocks that didn\u2019t have such a big short % of the float with big names like AMD, Starbucks &amp; Moderna being affected. These restrictions were reduced back to only 8 companies [Sunday](https://ibb.co/GV5TKxf), but are still limited to whole share aggregate buy limits on the crowd favorites.\n\nThe recent moves in the stock market have made some big changes in the social world as Steve Cohen deactivate his [Twitter](https://ibb.co/0KK2P59), while a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/Mf6V8tz) showed that more than \u00be of respondents are planning on leaving RBNHD while 13% already did it, with the limiting tactics being probably the biggest reason for retail investors to make this change.\n\nInteractive [Brokers](https://ibb.co/JzR5qCC) also re-opened trading on these names on Sunday, which brings to question if these platforms have insider knowledge of the future of the stocks, or did they just increased their liquidity just like [RBNHD](https://ibb.co/P6WXwDj) after they raised more than $1B earlier in the week.\n\nSo\u2026 I think the stock market is still very volatile and the short squeezes can keep on going for an unknown period of time as markets can act in an unusual pattern for longer than anyone can anticipate, or the short squeeze can vanish in a second\u2026 this one is very hard to predict\u2026 Yes, keep the pedal to the medal in the hot stocks but also stay invested in great companies as good earnings reports haven\u2019t helped most stocks again this quarter, but may provide good buying opportunities for the long-term.\n\nAnd finally, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wc2P16r) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way as we await to see the Manufacturing Indexes numbers in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v).\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "So to sum up a previous post, I bought 25 shares of $GME back in 2019 on RH and forgot about my account until a normal e-mail changed my entire outlook on life. Most of my life I've been broke, my mom was a waitress and restaruant worker, my dad laid carpet and worked as a truck driver. We always had what we needed but we didn't always have what we wanted. I watched money pass through my parents hands as quickly as they got it and until recently I had followed the same trend, until 25 shares of $GME changed my prespective. When I started reseaching and found out that r/wallstreetbets and u/deepfuckingvalue started this ride I was thrilled, I watched in horror 2008 when my grandfather lost his manufatruing business, my dad lost his floor covering business and we for years I watched as they fought banks because the bank said they hadn't been paying their mortage, when they had records they had. The home I grew up in was foreclosed on and bulldozed over for a shopping mall....\n\nThis made me hate the system more than anything else it was in that moment that I suddenly became frugal 'Ballin on a Ramen Budget' is what I'd tell my friends, I had money but I would skip meals to save money never wanting to find myself in the postion my parents found themselves in at 35 years old (I'm 30) so I fought and clawed and saved every little bit. I however forgot about the 25 stocks I bought two years ago.... So when I discovered my 25 shares where worth 8k I was thrilled I mean it's not a life changing amount but it could make things a little more comfortable for me, but research brain took over and I had to learn why this was happening and when I realized that there was a community that hated this system as much as me I sat and smiled at my computer screen for a solid ten mins. so I read, read and read some more. There are so many of you to many to list that who's OP's and stories I read about what was going on and it helped make my decison even easier. \n\nI took all of my savings (less one years worth of expenses for me) roughtly around $70k and I dumped it into the market, then I was so disguested with what RH pulled this week taking our ability to trade I left the shares I had parked at RH (roughtly 100) and then I transfered my cash to TD then through the help of a trusted friend who works in the market over the course of a week we grew that money into $200K in buying power and it's all thanks to you! IT WAS ALL YOU! \n\nI want to see the system fucking burn, If I go broke then let it happen I've been broke before but I will not fucking sell! This is for my Mom, Dad, Grandfather, This Is For All of You!\n\nI love you fucking guys, thanks for this ride it's one I'll never forget! I can't thank you enough! I'll leave you with these words from the man himself \n\n\u201cI want you to back yourself into a corner. Give yourself no choice but to succeed. Let the consequences of failure become so dire and so unthinkable that you\u2019ll have no choice but to do whatever it takes to succeed.\u201d \u2015 **Jordan Belfort**\n\n**I'm not fucking selling! HOLD THE LINE!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[I'm not FUCKING SELLING!](https://preview.redd.it/wpukqn75hue61.png?width=1531&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=397d5658b31ce3fd0d764e2499af223e92182899)",
