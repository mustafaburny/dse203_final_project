Due to a lot of reasons which are not important to us in effect, this is more something that some \"smart\" HFs are trying to front run than something which actually exists. This sets them up for a massive squeeze &lt; 17 May\n\nBesides these little quircks QQQ is FAR below where it should be given the EXTREMELY NEW ACCOMODATIVE stance that the FED is giving us and the EXTREMELY GOOD earnings. \n\nsome sellside analysts already have a 5K target for AMZN since the earnings ... \n\n**TLDR Buy QQQ 350 for any expiration after 17 May depending on your risk tolerance**",

The follow companies in Tech (XLK) have shown some strength and gone on a bit of a run.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/utk79n1qlo171.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c33200cbf190f0898afe16c76a22a9353257f036\n\nThe following companies are showing signs they may run up in the coming months. Personally, I\u2019d narrow my research to these companies. I\u2019m a semiconductor nerd, so I\u2019m happy to see signs of a turnaround in INTC, AMD, and MU.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sz9ubhkslo171.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43812473c30a230ed2108ef37c6954bb2e3cda64\n\n**What\u2019s a good bet in the long term?**\n\nUtilities (XLU), Consumer Staples (XLP), and Healthcare (XLV) all look like good sectors for long term bets. The problem is that they are starting to underperform the SPY in the short term.\n\nXLRE seems to be floating around with the SPY, and slightly outperforming in the short term. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019m going to focus on short term investments within strong short term sectors until I see the trajectory for these long term plays start to turn around in the short term.\n\n**This is a Casino Sir - My Bets/Positions:**\n\n**XLK -\u2013 Long Call - 7/16 @ 0.7 delta**\n\n**XLY -\u2013 Long Call - 7/16 @ 0.7 delta**\n\nWanted to enter a PAYC PCS but the B/A was too wide.\n\n**MU \u2013- PCS \u2013 7/16 @ 0.7 delta for credit &gt; 1/3 strike width**\n\n\u201cThe men who have succeeded are men who have chosen one line and stuck to it.\u201d \u2013 Some Rich Asshole \n\n**Can I get a TL;DR?**\n\n*TL;DR \u2013 Ride waves to the moon.

        "selftext": "Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. I wanted to provide a different perspective on investing that might entertain or help others. Nothing I say should be considered fact, but instead my opinion. There is no guarantee of returns, but I believe my method lowers the long term risk while maximizing on potential less volatile gains. I do not have any positions in these companies, but I intend to add some or all of these positions to my portfolio.        \n\nMy thesis is generated around the semiconductor meeting held by the White House. I believe the White House tipped their hand into which companies will be their preferred partners of the future. This article will provide a layout of which stocks may be considered attractive from a long term speculative point of view. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-09/white-house-to-host-over-a-dozen-companies-at-chips-meeting.          \n\nStellantis NV, General Motors, Cummins and Ford: old school American companies with a large number of employees and a large supply chain that relies on Ford and GM to remain in business. I believe they were invited to the meeting because of their relationship with Biden from the Obama administration. Gas for tronics 2.0?       \n\nAlphabet: tech company that has government contracts. Can provide unique insight into current and future trends based on search history.           \n\nDell, HP, Medtronic: computer and medical equipment manufacturers. It\u2019s interesting how Nvidia and AMD were left off the invite list.         \n\nMicron, Taiwan Semiconductor, Samsung, Intel: semiconductor manufacturers. We all know about the chip shortage.       \n\nAT&amp;T: possible link to 5g capabilities/access. I\u2019m wondering who the government is going to give their grant money to for providing rural areas with affordable internet and broadband.         \n\nNorthrop Grumman: we all know about the b-21. I believe that is likely why they got the invite, but there is also the potential that they are developing the 6th gen fighter of choice for the military.         \n\nNo price points, no buy or sell recommendations, do your own research if you\u2019re looking for reasons to buy or sell.",

        "selftext": "The research community is critical to developing breakthrough innovations in regenerative medicine. 3D Systems, with the addition of\u00a0Allevi Inc, is now able to provide a robust set of Allevi by 3D Systems bioprinting solutions to researchers and industry giants in hundreds of labs globally.\n\nAllevi is a leading innovator in the bioprinting space with an exclusive focus on the research and development community. Leading laboratories leverage Allevi\u2019s portfolio of hardware, biomaterials and software to design, engineer and build solutions for tissue engineering, organ-on-a-chip research, pharmaceutical validation, biomaterial development, and regenerative medicine.\n\nAllevi\u00a0desktop 3D bioprinters are among the most versatile, powerful and easy-to-use bioprinters on the market.\u00a0Customers also have access to a wide range of biomaterials\u2014bioinks, bioink additives, cells, reagents and consumables\u2014as well as an intuitive software interface.\n\nIn the medical field, 3D Sytems has delivered additive manufacturing solutions to the healthcare community for more than 30 years. Having produced more than 2,000,000 serial component medical devices and 140,000 patient-specific surgical cases, the company is now scaling the production of bioprinted clinical applications. This technology will elevate patient care through various clinical applications ranging from acellular bioresorbable devices to functionalized solid organs for transplantation.\n\nBefore bioprinter hardware manufacturer Allevi, 3D Systems had already entered the bioprinting services market. Together with United Therapeutics Corporation and its organ manufacturing and transplantation-focused subsidiary, Lung Biotechnology PBC, the company achieved significant progress in the development of next-generation bioprinting solutions for lung scaffolds that are capable of full size, vascularized, rapid, micron-level printing.\n3D Systems\u2019 capabilities as a technology innovator, spanning hardware, software, and materials science, combined with United Therapeutics\u2019 renowned expertise in regenerative medicine has enabled advances in lung modeling, 3D printing, as well as material formulation and material handling to yield significant capabilities in bioprinters and biomaterials for the eventual production of transplantable organs.\nTo meet the evolving needs of the clinical and R&amp;D communities, 3D Systems continues to push technologies to facilitate advanced application development. The Print to Perfusion process enables 3D printing of high-resolution scaffolds, which can be perfused with living cells to create tissues.\nThe ability to print large, vascularized, highly detailed hydrogel scaffolds at rapid speeds is opening new opportunities for a range of tissue applications. In addition, we are developing bioprinting solutions that are both commercially viable and scalable from prototype to production.\n\nLink: https://www.3dprintingmedia.network/3d-systems-continues-push-into-bioprinting-with-allevi-partnership/",
