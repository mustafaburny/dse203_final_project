        "selftext": "I posted yesterday about the upcoming tik tok deal and what it could mean regarding Microsoft stock price. As I\u2019m currently heavily invested in Microsoft calls I thought I\u2019d share with you all this incredible opportunity for a big cash out. \n\nContext: ByteDance is a Chinese company that owns tik tok. US Companies have been looking to purchase the US version of TikTok. Trumpie doesn\u2019t like the idea of the Chinese owning tik tok to SPY on us, and last month signed an executive order that will effectively ban tik tok unless it is sold to a US company by mid September. \n\nCurrently, the main players looking to purchase tik tok are Microsoft teamed up with Walmart, and oracle. \n\nNow between the top bidders it makes much more sense for Microsoft to be selected as the winning buyer. Oracle does not own any type of social platform whereas Microsoft owns Xbox and other communication channels such as teams. Additionally, the tik tok interim CEO herself said that she saw great synergy potential with Walmart as they could sell products through the app. \n\nBased on the above, it seems like a no brainer that Tik Tok will be sold to Microsoft and Walmart....\n\nBut hold the phone, yesterday news came out that China has now put a limit on its data exports which would include tik tok. This limit acts as a retaliation against trumpie and many believe it could prolong the deal. \n\nNow if you\u2019ve seen anything this administration it\u2019s Trump not giving a shit about the right thing to do. He stated 9/20 as tik tok shutting off unless it\u2019s sold and honestly seems like a win win if the deal goes through. \n\nBecause there is uncertainty on if the deal goes through, but it should theoretically happen, this makes NOW a great time to buy MSFT/WMT calls. \n\nMy guess is that if the biggest new social media platform is sold to Microsoft, you could see a jump up to $240-$250 overnight for some hugeeee gains. \n\nHappy trading! \n\nMSFT $230 c 9/18, 10/2",

I\u2019m slightly out of balance because I have more options than shares.  $196k in calls vs $162k in shares.  So I\u2019m like $34k out of balance, somewhat breaking my own rule.  So I\u2019m living a little dangerously until 9/18 at which time I\u2019m going to execute 4 apple calls and 2 msft calls.  Which will bring my share total up like $65k.  I might have to sell some options so I have the buying power in my account to get this done.  At that point, I will have more shares than options so I\u2019ll be green lit to buy more calls.  This is how I enforce discipline on myself to not get to overextended.  Leverage, but not too much leverage.  Good luck to us all!",

How they wish they had gotten in at $1000, $1300, $1500, $1750, $2000.\n\nEveryone asking about best price to get in, whether it will go higher, etc.\n\nWell, now TSLA is down almost 40% from its ATH post-split. Pre-split it was at $2200. Then there was a 5:1 split, which drove the price to $440, at which point it rocketed up to $500 (or $3000 pre-split).\n\nNow TSLA has cratered all the way to $340 (or $1700 pre-split). Its back at the price point it was at right after the split was announced. Its still high for some people here, but its trading at a discount from its ATH of $3000.\n\nTo all those TSLA FOMO-er's, its time to step up to their conviction. Do you believe in TSLA as the \"company of the future\" that has a valuation potential that can't be captured (ie. ARKK's perspective, and hence their $7000 pre-split price target potential).\n\nAdded fun: AMD, BA, MSFT, AAPL are all hammered right now. Again, these are all stocks that I've seen people have incredible FOMO about missing the August run up. If you genuinely believe these stocks have a future, and are thinking long term (ie. over 1 year holdings), these price points are good entries for a DCA strategy. Basically, all these stocks gave up ALL their August gains, which means if you missed the boat at the end of July, nows the time to get back in because the train came back to the station.\n\nIf you believe the valuations of these stocks are still too high, then feel free to disregard this entire post.",

        "selftext": "Thursday was the Nasdaq's largest one-day decline from a record high in its history, according to Bespoke Investment Group.\n\nAll three major indexes finished the day sharply lower. The Nasdaq closed down nearly 5%, and the S&amp;P fell 3.5%, while the Dow finished 2.8%, or 808 points, lower.\n\nSo, what happened?\n\nFor one, the Nasdaq has been outperforming the other two major stock indexes \u2014 the Dow (INDU) and the S&amp;P 500 (SPX) \u2014 for months. The rally has been going on for long enough that investors are now taking profit.\n\nEven so, the Nasdaq remains up nearly 28% in 2020, still far outpacing its counterparts. The Dow, which only recently turned positive for the year, is back in the red.\n\n\"Although there is no single driver for the weakness, it seems as if investors all of a sudden realized how overbought stocks are and sold. Someone yelled fire in a crowded theater and everyone left at once,\" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial, in emailed comments.\n\nBut there are also technical reasons for Thursday's decline: As US-China relations sour, investors are moving money out of tech, which could get hit the hardest from a potential increase in tariffs.\n\n\"The Nasdaq is getting hit hard with the continued rotation into cyclicals and expectations big-tech will ultimately pay the cost to a further deterioration with US-Chinese relations,\" said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.\n\nStocks in cyclical sectors are expected to perform better as the economy is recovering.\n\nThe Big Tech companies such as Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT), all of which are part of the Nasdaq, have become the safe-haven investment of the summer. But investors have beginning to wonder when the rally will run out of steam, either because of increased regulation or because the economy as a whole picks up enough to void the need for safety picks altogether.\n\n\\-- [https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/03/investing/nasdaq-selloff-stock-market-today/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/03/investing/nasdaq-selloff-stock-market-today/index.html)",

        "selftext": "Needham:\n\n\"Yesterday, at AMZN's devices and services event, AMZN announced Luna+, a $6/month (intro price) cloud gaming subscription competitor to Google's Stadia ($10/month), Microsoft xCloud($15/month), and EA's Origin Access ($15/month). **Although AMZN's content is inferior to competitors today, we expect its Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) to be below competitors, thanks to its Twitch and AWS integrations.**\"\n\n\"We believe additional value from Luna+ comes from: a) building brand trust with the next generation (16-26 year olds); b) upside from sub revs, which are valued at 9x Rev vs AMZN's avg of 4x; and, c) a new rev stream using AWS &amp; Twitch that raises AMZN\u2019s barriers to entry.\"\n\n\"**We calculate that AMZN's media revenue streams are worth nearly $600B, or about 40% of AMZN's total EV, suggesting these businesses are the most undervalued piece of AMZN.**\"\n\n\"Advertising's Hidden Value. The \"hidden\" value of AMZN's advertising's expected 50% y/y growth in FY21E is important because many public companies with comparable ad rev growth rates trade above 7x and up to 22x revs. We use an average of 14.5x EV/Rev.\"\n\n\"Subscription Revs Hidden Value. Similarly, subscription revenue streams typically trade at much higher EV/Rev multiples than AMZN's core business, so anything that adds revenue in subscription silos grows AMZN's value faster, we believe. Consumer-facing subscription revenue is generally predictable, sticky, has upside optionality to add more rev/month over time, and has high switching costs and barriers to entry. As a consequence, many subscription business models trade at 7x-12x EV/Rev, well above AMZN's avg.\"\n\n\"Luna. By implication, successful growth of subscriber revenue streams suggests faster upside valuation revisions for AMZN. A gating factor to this potential upside value driver is introducing new subscription services, like Luna.\"\n\n\"Twitch and AWS Integrations Lower AMZN's Risks. AMZN's economic risks of Luna failing is lower than its competitors because it already owns the cloud servers required through AWS, and it also owns the dominant video game viewing platform in Twitch, which it is integrating into Luna. Both AWS and Twitch should lower Luna's CAC. Therefore, even if Luna fails, it should cost far less than other companies that don't already own cloud servers and a huge number of video gamers already spending hours per day on a sister-platform.\"",

        "selftext": "I will start off my discsussion using a couple of examples where investors/analysts missed the big picture and the company/stock has proven that they're much more than that.\n\n**Microsoft**\n\n\nIn July 2013, Microsoft stock had the biggest drop of the century after reporting their earnings. The stock dropped because of investors disappointment in the Surface RT laptop. They ignored the biggest elephant in the room that is Windows Azure, now known as Microsoft Azure. Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing division and it has been the major growth driver for Microsoft. Of course, the CEO change from Steve Ballmer to Satya Nadella helped but Satya's vision was all about cloud computing and it was completely ignored by investors at that time. \n\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2013/07/19/as-shares-fall-12-percent-microsoft-experiences-its-biggest-drop-since-2000/\n\n**Apple**\n\nBack in 2018, investors/analysts were focusing on iPhone X sales figures. Warren Buffett saw the big picture. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett said long-term investors of Apple\u2019s stock shouldn\u2019t obsess with near-term iPhone sales. \u201cThe idea that you\u2019re going to spend loads of time trying to guess how many iPhone X are going to be sold in a three-month period totally misses the point,\u201d he stated. His big picture was looking at Apple as a brand and its ecosystem\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/30/warren-buffett-says-he-bought-just-a-little-more-apple-recently.html\n\nLook at where Microsoft and Apple stocks were then and where they are trading at now.\n\n\n**Intel**\n\nI'd like to use the same logic for Intel. It dropped 20% after the earnings call last quarter in July. The big picture  Intel's Investors/analysts are  missing is that they are ignoring this industry leader\u2019s methodical transition into higher growth businesses and focusing solely on solvable supply chain problems ( 10 nm/7 nm transistor density issues). I will not be discussing the fact that AMD/NVidia are using 7 nm process and that Intel isn't. Also, the fact that TSMC will be on 5 nm by the time Intel fixes the 10 nm/7 nm node problems. Those are problems I'm well aware of and they have been beaten to death already. There is nothing I can add to that. I will talk about that later on but in the end as not the focal points. What I'd like to talk about and focus on is the data-centric transformation and its MobilEye division.\n\n\n**Data Centric Transformation**\n\nIntel in 2019 pivoted from being a PC centric business to a data centric business. The TAM of this is 250 billion dollars. Revenue in this business group has grown from 42% of revenue in 2015 to 51% of revenue over the TTM. While many business transitions result in periods of low performance, as firms switch focus from declining to new businesses, Intel has managed to grow its revenue by 12% compounded annually over the past four years as it better positions itself for future growth.\n\nhttps://channelbuzz.ca/2019/04/intel-emphasizes-data-centric-transformation-of-company-at-new-xeon-launch-30025/\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/08/18/put-your-chips-on-the-table-with-intel-corporation/#527d69d35951\n\n**Self driving business**\n\nIntel purchased MobilEye in 2015. It is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Intel . Mobileye has a plan to dominate self-driving. Self driving taxis and cars are a big growth business. MobilEye is in a great position to capitalize on this business. Mobileye says it shipped 17.4 million systems last year. Today, over 40 million cars have Mobileye technology installed, and its products have been selected for implementation in serial production of 313 car models from our 27 OEM partners by 2017 (compared to 36 car models across seven OEMs in 2010). Some of the partners include Volkswagen, BMW, Nissan, Ford. It also has partnered with NIO, a Chinese EV company which people have dubbed the Chinese Tesla.\n\nThe firm\u2019s acquisition of Mobileye strategically positions it to build out its driverless technology business as well. In just three years, Mobileye has experienced rapid growth, with revenue increasing from $210 million in 2017 to $879 million in 2019. Its share of automobile semiconductor sales increased from just 0.5% to 1.9% over the same time. If Mobileye continues taking market share in this fast-growing segment, Mobileye\u2019s could provide a meaningful contribution to Intel\u2019s operations, as it made up just over 1% of revenue in 2019. ResearchAndMarkets.com expects the autonomous/driverless market to grow 18% compounded annually from 2020 to 2025. Intel is positioned to grow with this new market.\n\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/ford-expands-partnership-with-mobileye-intels-autonomous-driving-business/\n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2018/10/29/18039216/volkswagen-intel-mobileye-self-driving-ride-hailing-israel-2019\n\nhttps://newsroom.intel.com/news/mobileye-nio-partner-bring-level-4-autonomous-vehicles-consumers-china-beyond/\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/08/18/put-your-chips-on-the-table-with-intel-corporation/#527d69d35951\n\nhttps://www.engadget.com/mobileye-testing-autonomous-cars-germany-104521486.html\n\n\n**PC Business**\n\nThis is the side of Intel most people immediately associate Intel with. Intel\u2019s PC-centric business is not something to write-off. There is still a piece of the PC-centric market where Intel has an opportunity to grow: graphics processing units (GPU). Allied Market Research, expects the GPU market to grow from $19.8 billion in 2019 to nearly $201 billion in 2027 or by 34% compounded annually. For example, Intel is aggressively entering the discreet GPU business, which is about 80% of the current GPU market. The iGPU processors codenamed Tiger Lake just released September 2nd. Intel poached AMD's GPU guy Raja Koduri and nVidia's Tom Peterson. Intel hired engineers and marketing experts from Advanced Micro Devices and NVIDIA, the market leader in the space, to assemble a team to develop and rollout the firm\u2019s Intel Xe GPU.\n\nIntel is also releasing entry level processors. The entry-level processors will be targeted at budget-tier laptops and fanless mini desktops when they launch in early 2021. \n\nhttps://www.nextplatform.com/2020/09/02/intel-puts-its-xe-gpu-stakes-in-the-ground/\nhttps://wccftech.com/intel-jasper-lake-10nm-tremont-atom-cpus-leak-pentium-celeron-skus-2021/\n\n\n**7 nm/10 nm process**\n\nSince I have your attention until here - I'd like to say one final thing about this debacle. Lot of people assume that Intel's problems with this are due to complacency. Its not. Its due to Intel attempting to achieve and do something others have been unable to do, which is the exact opposite of complacency. Intel tried to use GAAFET for 7 nm when TSMC and Samsung warned Intel not to.  Intel was warned by TSMC and Samsung that the GAA-FET technique is too challenging to implement at this point in time, but Intel\u2019s pride and persistence led it to stubbornly try and tackle the GAA-FET problem, until it finally conceded this July.\n\nI agree Intel fucked up here but the point I'm trying to make is that this was not due to complacency as widely believed. Intel has a lot of management problems, hostile work environment etc but complacency is not one of them.  Intel never got complacent about its objectives, but it may have gotten complacent about its approaches, methods, and processes.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/i8qrx4/intel_exemployee_reveals_insider_details_on/\nhttps://www.dvhardware.net/article73530.html\n\n\n**Tl/DR; Post Summary / Post Script** : \n\nI'm perfecty aware that AMD and nVidia are eating Intel's lunch and have better more powerful CPUs/GPUs. However, Intel is much more than that and its other divisions are what will drive future growth. Analysts and investors are missing this big picture.",

Don't try to be a hero calling bottom when a clear bottom has not shown itself.\n\nTaking a look at AMZN, MSFT, &amp; GOOGL charts should help paint this picture better.\n\n[AMZN Daily Candle Chart](https://preview.redd.it/a4cg6rl2zsm51.png?width=1543&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1efead5e7afd376ec9bd6856857cdd0a0891f80)\n\n[MSFT Daily Candle Chart](https://preview.redd.it/zutwr967zsm51.png?width=1543&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30030941855be77df09ca3d001ca8fbd452522ce)\n\n[GOOGL Daily Candle Chart](https://preview.redd.it/ggbp5b29zsm51.png?width=1543&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9177952a6ebf33ac4c4885dd213664b2c5cd15c)\n\nAll three of these tech giants have broken the trend line, retested it on the Wednesday/Thursday bounce, and gone back down. Closing the week at new lows for MSFT and AMZN. AMZN even sporting a bearish divergence with RSI over 70 since the July high.\n\nWith 10 week and 40 week moving averages as far apart as they are, major price corrections could take place and it would be nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nWe all just like to make money. But I know many will be mad even looking at charts pointing towards further downside corrections for their beloved tech giants. I don't want them to but its what i think will happen.\n\nFeel free to discuss future market possibilities, rip me apart for making lines on a chart, or comment a nice \"fuck you gay bear\".\n\nIf the market turned around early next week and SPY never looked back at 330 I would turn bullish very easily.

        "selftext": "Back in July, Barron\u2019s ran a story profiling the rise of Nvidia (NVDA) as the company moved past Intel (INTC) in market cap to become the most valuable US semiconductor company. The  article cited Nvidia\u2019s favorable exposure to data center, gaming, and  AI as major reasons why the company overtook top spot from Intel. Only  two months later, Nvidia is now worth $107bn more than Intel. In other  words, Nvidia is worth more than an AMD more than its Santa Clara rival.  Around the same time, AMD (AMD)  also began to see significant out-performance relative to Intel shares.  With continued momentum in the PC market on the back of its Ryzen  processors and increased success in data center with the EPYC product  line, AMD has risen 57% since the start of July. Over that period, Intel  declined 15%. \n\nIn contrast to Nvidia and AMD, Intel is disproportionately associated with  the PC. Yet even within the PC market, analyst commentary has been  overwhelmingly positive on AMD whereas doubts have surfaced over Intel\u2019s  ability to innovate and remain competitive. In the span of a week at  the end of July, Intel announced a major delay with its 7nm chips and  AMD beat Q2 earnings, raised guidance, and hit its highest PC market  share since 2013. However, the focus on Intel as a struggling PC player  has wrongly overlooked several important developments that set the company up for a near-term rebound in PC and [long-term revenue opportunities in the same higher growth end markets that have fueled premium valuations for both Nvidia and AMD](https://blackjacketco.com/f/new-brand-new-intel-growth-ahead-for-tiger-lake-edge-and-av).\u00a0\n\n1. Release of Tiger Lake processor, expanded efforts in graphics via  Xe architecture, and development of discrete GPUs for data center and  desktop\n2. Continued momentum in company shift to data-centric business first and PC business second\n3. Expanded Total Addressable Market (TAM) associated with edge computing and edge-enabled technologies\n4. Competitive positioning in autonomous vehicle technology\n\nIntel is currently priced for stagnant to declining revenues, further market share erosion, and lower  relative probability of success compared to Nvidia and AMD. Given recent  product releases and refreshes, as well as a strong strategic vision to  increase share in these higher growth end markets, Intel revenue is  more likely to accelerate and lead to significant multiple expansion in  the coming years.\u00a0\n\n* Assigning Intel CY23 PT of $125 per share\n* FY23 revenue projected at $100bn\n* FY23 net income projected at $34bn delivering 7.55 in EPS\n* Applying 16.55x P/E and 4.55 P/S\u00a0\n\nFor an in-depth and comprehensive breakdown on Intel's competitive positioning, see below:\n\n**Tiger Lake and Renewed PC Innovation**\u00a0\n\nYesterday  Intel finally revealed the highly anticipated Tiger Lake 11th  generation processors for ultra-thin high-performance laptops. Industry  reporting in previous months had speculated that the new system-on-chip  (SoC \u2013 incorporates different components like graphics and AI into one  integrated unit) would offer CPU performance advances and improvements  in graphics and AI. Intel even leaked some specs on Monday that seemed  to confirm some of the performance metrics. Although independent  industry studies are required to run Tiger Lake through its full paces,  the event demonstrated that not only can Intel still innovate, it is  more than premature to start counting the company out on PCs.\u00a0\n\nTiger  Lake clocks up to 20% higher frequencies compared to the 10th  generation Ice Lake family and can reach a single core turbo of 4.8 GHz.  During the presentation, Intel noted that the integrated Iris Xe  graphics perform better than 90% of PCs sold last year, on-board AI is  up to 5x more effective, and WiFi connectivity is up to 3x faster. In a  like-for-like comparison to AMD, Tiger Lake enabled 4x faster photo  upscaling, 2x faster video processing and exporting via Adobe Pro, and  20% faster performance in both Microsoft Word and PowerPoint. For  gaming, Intel conducted side-by-side tests using Gears Tactics. Laptops  running AMD 4800U with integrated graphics and a Nvidia MX350 discrete  graphics card (with Intel 10th Gen i7) performed worse than Tiger Lake.  Intel\u2019s test showed that Tiger Lake handled the game at up to 66% higher  frames per second versus the AMD and Nvidia-powered laptops.\u00a0\n\nBarring significant discrepancies found during independent reviews, Intel just  delivered performance on 10nm that is equivalent to what is possible on  7nm. With the simultaneous launch of the Evo brand to encompass the new  11th generation-powered ultra-thin high-performance laptop range, Intel  can begin building customer brand recognition and altering perceptions  that Intel has lost competitive footing in the PC market. With 50 PC  designs set to ship with Tiger Lake as soon as this fall, and at least  150 designs anticipated from partner OEMs, Intel may see a very  near-term recovery in its PC market share even despite the 7nm delay.\u00a0 \n\n**Transition to Data-Centric Business and Future at the Edge**\n\nMore  important to Intel\u2019s future is the multi-year shift towards  higher-growth end markets associated with cloud, edge, and data. Rather  than PCs, Intel sees its primary business as the Data-Centric reporting  segment that now comprises 52% of revenues. That figure is likely to  expand in coming quarters following 34% YoY growth in the most recent  earnings report. In FY19 Q2, the Data-Centric segment only accounted for  46% of revenues.\u00a0\n\nThat  Data-Centric segment includes: The Data Center Group (36.3% of total  Intel revenues); Non-Volatile Memory Storage Group (8.5%);  Internet-of-Things Group (3.4%); Programmable Solutions Group (2.6%);  and Mobileye (0.7%). The two largest contributors to the segment are  performing extremely well. The Data Center Group grew 43% YoY and saw  operating income climb 72%. The second largest business in the segment,  Non-Volatile Memory Storage, grew 76% YoY for record revenue on the back  of NAND demand growth and higher Average Selling Prices (ASPs).\u00a0\n\nBy  2024, Intel expects its TAM to reach $300bn. But $230bn of this is  attributed to the Data-Centric TAM. And Intel\u2019s own calculations may be  slightly conservative. In the company\u2019s analysis of its various end  markets, Intel only mentioned the edge compute market in general terms.  Yet that market alone is projected to surpass $100bn by 2030. As much as  public cloud adoption drove demand for server-related products over the  past five years, the edge could end up being a far more important  trend. That is because, in addition to further server demand, the edge  will enable billions of IoT devices to finally become widespread after  years of hype. With TAM growth associated with edge server CPU, GPU, and  storage, plus IoT and edge AI solutions, Intel can achieve growth into  the 2030s so long as the company can execute on its strategic vision. \u00a0\n\n*Edge Server*\u00a0\n\nAn S&amp;P Global study  in spring 2020 estimated that Intel has 90-95% share of the data center  CPU market despite recent share gains by AMD. While edge server  architectures and processes differ versus hyperscale cloud servers, this  figure is testament to the strength of Intel\u2019s relationships with the  leading cloud providers that are also among the early movers in the edge  computing space \u2013 namely Amazon with its Lambda@Edge platform,  Microsoft with Azure Functions, and Google with Google Cloud Functions. \u00a0\n\nFor  smaller edge providers especially, like Fastly, Akamai, or Cloudflare,  there will be particular emphasis on price-per-performance for server  components. Until recently, that dynamic favored AMD whose EPYC Rome  7742 processor rivals Intel\u2019s Xeon Platinum 8280 on performance yet  undercuts it on price by about 60%. The cost efficiency of EPYC led to  some important edge server design wins for AMD, including Cloudflare\u2019s  new GenX server that excluded Intel parts for the first time.\u00a0\n\nThe  latest Xeon processors had been on the market for a couple years,  though, and Intel refreshed the product line earlier this year in an  attempt to greatly reduce cost while maintaining performance. In its 24  February press release, Intel directly addressed the need to become more  competitive with AMD on price-per-performance noting that the Xeon  refresh: \u201c\u2026\\[reinforces\\] Intel\u2019s data center leadership by providing  greater performance and performance-per-dollar choices for\u2026customers  across cloud, network and edge.\u201d While Intel compromised on  compatibility with certain server designs, the result is 1.42x better  price-per-core-performance and a cost of $141 per-core for the Gold  6258R. The price tag puts Xeon in a much stronger position relative to  EPYC Rome 7742 which goes for $108 per-core.\u00a0\n\nDespite  early advantages in cost-per-performance for AMD, Intel still managed  to double its edge deployments year-over-year according to Forbes. And  its impressive partner list includes Lenovo, Red Hat, Advantech,  Caswell, Inventec, Lanner, Nexcom, World Wide Technology, Ericsson, ZTE,  Verizon, Vodafone, Nokia, and China Telecom, among others. With drastic  improvements in price-per-performance, Intel could very well see  additional customer wins in upcoming quarters.\u00a0\n\nBeyond  CPU, edge applications will see an increase in demand for integrated  and hybrid GPUs. Between advancements in Intel Xe graphics and its  development of discrete graphics cards, the company will become better  positioned to take advantage of the more than 33% CAGR projected for  GPUs from 2020 to 2027 \u2013 taking the market from just under $20bn in 2019  to over $200bn according to Deloitte.  Even if Nvidia and AMD maintain large leads over Intel in GPU market  share for edge servers, even a marginal portion of the market could be  meaningful to the Data Center Group which measured around $7bn in Q2.\u00a0\n\nIn  addition, edge servers present an unprecedented opportunity for NAND  solutions as well \u2013 specifically flash storage that utilizes the NVMe  (Non-Volatile Memory Express) protocol. Edge servers have strong need  for high-performance startup operations and extremely reliable storage.  That is because rapid startup times are critical for edge providers to  quickly launch computing instances and deliver the lowest possible  latency for their customers. Improvements in NVMe NAND greatly shrink  the physical storage footprint, reduce power and cooling costs, all the  while improving the overall speed, flexibility, and failure rates. And  Intel Optane and 3D NAND SSDs are exceptionally reliable for storage and  offer performance improvements over legacy storage solutions.\u00a0\n\n*IoT and AI*\n\nMuch  like edge servers, edge deployed IoT devices will similarly boost  demand for Intel processors. For workload intensive industrial IoT,  Intel has its Core processor. And the Intel Atom processor is  purpose-built for lower-power or embedded applications. Because IoT  devices will collect and process vast amounts of data, these  applications will also require significant amounts of flash memory \u2013  specifically NAND. On-device NAND SSD can increase data transfer speeds  while also integrating module-level security features, remote  management, and more flexible power configurations. Collectively,  improvements in NAND will lower total cost of ownership for these  machines. \u00a0\n\nThe edge will lead  to rapid growth for edge AI chipsets that enable IoT devices to deploy  machine learning at the edge without having to send data via internet  back to a centralized data center. Deloitte notes that around 300  million edge AI chips were sold in 2017, but this year could see more  than 750 million units hit the market. With compounded annual growth in  edge AI chipsets anticipated to outpace the broader semiconductor  industry by a considerable amount, ABI research predicts that these edge chips will surpass the market for cloud AI chips by 2025 \u2013 marking a massive shift.\u00a0\n\n**Mobileye and Autonomous Driving Technology**\u00a0\n\nIt  is interesting the extent to which mainstream conversations in media  and financial commentary largely exclude Intel\u2019s Mobileye and instead  focus on Tesla as the technology leader in autonomous vehicles and  Nvidia as the chipmaker best positioned to disrupt. Although Telsa  claims to offer autonomous modes for its vehicles, based on the 5-level  autonomous capability hierarchy \u2013 the industry standard established by  the Society of Automotive Engineers \u2013 the most advanced cars currently  on the market only operate at level 2+. Level 2+ falls between levels 2  (partial automation) and 3 (conditional automation). The hardware to  support full level 5 autonomy does exist in 2020, and the software  necessary to manage these systems is not too far behind. However, it  will likely take 5-7 years before manufacturing volumes reach levels to  drive down hardware prices, the necessary regulatory frameworks come  into place, and fully autonomous vehicles gain broad consumer  acceptance. \u00a0\n\nIn the  intermediary period, the progression towards level 5 autonomy will  continue to be gradual and incremental. Higher degrees of autonomy will  be achieved by increasingly sophisticated advanced driver assistance  systems (ADAS) that prove out the viability of these technologies and  underpin the manufacturing, regulatory, and consumer environment that  will facilitate the future arrival of self-driving cars. Beyond this, in  many cases the same technology at the center of levels 4 and 5 builds  on the existing foundations of ADAS capabilities. And the dominant  player in the ADAS market is not Tesla, Waymo, or Nvidia. It is  Mobileye.\u00a0\n\nMobileye\u2019s market  share has consistently stayed above 70% for years, even as competition  from other players has ramped up \u2013 Nvidia in particular. The Mobileye  solution is noteworthy, pairing its SoC \u2013 the EyeQ family \u2013 to support a  range of ADAS capabilities using only a single camera sensor. This  differs from the LiDAR and radar-based systems favored by Waymo, Uber,  GM-owned Cruise, and Nvidia. Tesla \u2013 who previously used Mobileye  technology until the two parted ways in 2016 \u2013 also leverages a  camera-based system. However, Tesla deploys ultrasonic sensors and  radars in combination with billions of miles of driver data.\u00a0\n\nMobileye\u2019s  commanding market share in ADAS means that its technology is used by  more than 300 models from 25 global automakers, resulting in 60 million  vehicles on the road worldwide. In contrast, Tesla currently has fewer  than 1 million vehicles on the road equipped with variants of its  autopilot technology. And Mobileye is already working with 4 major OEMs  to soon provide level 3 autonomous solutions. As part of its  arrangements with OEMs, Mobileye receives access to sensor data from  customer vehicles. At present, Mobileye is collecting 3.7 million miles  per day and growing as another 2 million vehicles from these OEMs are  set to join the data-sharing program over the next two years.\u00a0\n\nWhat  this translates to is a massive partner network with the world\u2019s  leading auto OEMs who will all have a vested interest in competing with  Tesla both in autonomous but also electric vehicles. This also means  that Mobileye has a significant advantage over Nvidia in getting its  ADAS and future autonomous solutions on vehicles. As Mobileye further  prioritizes its fully autonomous solutions, its leading competitive  positioning in ADAS, as well its strong relationships with OEMs, gives  the company a strategic advantage over its competitors as higher levels  of autonomous technologies go to market. This is evidenced by Mobileye\u2019s  strategic partnership with Tesla EV rival NIO to offer level 4 consumer  vehicles by 2022.\u00a0\n\nEven though  Mobileye made its name based on its single camera platform, the company  is separately developing what is called a full autonomous stack,  incorporating the necessary LiDAR, radar, non-camera sensors, GPS,  modems, and other hardware components that will run on its 5thgeneration  EyeQ processor. In the meantime, Mobileye recently demoed a  self-driving vehicle that navigated the congested streets of Jerusalem  using only 12 cameras and no LiDAR, radar, or non-camera sensors.\u00a0\n\nOn  the back of the hyperbolic move in Tesla shares YTD, numerous articles  have lauded the company\u2019s so-called multi-year advantages over rivals in  the space. Notably, in July Elon Musk stated that Tesla is \u201cvery close\u201d  to level 5 autonomy with no updates needed to hardware as the company\u2019s  Tesla Computer processor currently supports full autonomy. Mobileye\u2019s  EyeQ 5 also supports level 5 autonomy, however. And although the Tesla  Computer exceeds EyeQ 5 on tera operations per second (TOPS), EyeQ 5  offers footprint and power consumption advantages. Moreover, unlike most  other players in autonomous systems, Mobileye has opted for an open  architecture that enables OEMs to program their own software on top of  Mobileye hardware.\u00a0\n\nTesla has a  lead in data collected per mile at over 3 billion miles, but Mobileye is  catching up and its data repositories also exceed the billion-mile mark  on an annual run rate basis. To deepen the data sets available to  Mobileye, Intel also bought Israeli mobility-as-a-service company Moovit  for $900mn this year. Like Tesla, Mobileye is set to offer its  technology in the important robotaxi market that many in the industry  view as the precursor to consumer-adopted fully autonomous vehicles down  the line. Mobileye is launching pilot robotaxi fleets in Tel Aviv,  Paris, and Daegu City in 2022.\u00a0\n\nMobileye  still accounts for less than 1% of total Intel revenues despite  doubling sales since being acquired by Intel. Given the strength of  Mobileye\u2019s position in the ADAS market that is expected to grow to more  than $80bn by 2030, as well as the prospects in robotaxis and level 4/5  autonomous systems, Mobileye has strong potential to develop into a  major growth engine for Intel over the next 4-5 years.\u00a0\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIntel  shares are roughly flat since early 2018 despite revenues up almost 20%  from FY19 Q2 to FY20 Q2. The relative out-performance in Nvidia and AMD  shares over that time has furthered perceptions that Intel could fall  behind as the former two companies achieve sustained revenue growth tied  to more attractive end markets like data center, gaming, AI, and  autonomous vehicles.\u00a0\n\nHowever,  recent struggles with certain products and lost PC market share to AMD  have distracted investors from Intel\u2019s ongoing transition to a more data-centric business. With a $230bn TAM projected by 2024 for this  operating segment alone, Intel has multiple opportunities to likewise  drive revenue growth over the long-term.\u00a0\n\nGiven  the company\u2019s recent advancements with its 11th generation Tiger Lake SoC, continued progress in improving price-per-performance for edge  server components, and the vastly underrated leadership of Mobileye in  the ADAS and autonomous vehicle markets, Intel offers an extremely  compelling opportunity for investors seeking exposure to these  technology trends at a more reasonable valuation.\u00a0\n\n*You can find me on Twitter* [@BlackjacketCo](https://twitter.com/BlackjacketCo) *where I write about emerging technologies, industry news, and long-term market trends.

        "selftext": "Please stop pumping a 3.3 Billion dollar company, that just had price targets jump 75 to 120 (60% price increase) with no underlying changes to its fundamentals. Any google search will bring up a million article giving glowing praises that SNOW can be the next AAPL or MSFT, sure anything can happen, but that's 10 years down the road if at all. \n\nThere are no options yet for this company, so there are few metrics to determine the expected moves in price, but you can do simple DD before making this sort of commitment. \n\nWant to know how you can tell a bad buy from a good buy?\n\n two main categories I use are \n\n## Future Growth Indicators \n\nWhen gauging future growth of a company just ask yourself these questions and try to find answer. \n\n* What are you (the investor) waiting for now that you bought 275 dollars of SNOW?\n * Do they have a roadmap of future services ?\n  * What sort of revenue streams will they be focusing on in this pandemic, will it be investing into growing existing contract or spend liquid cash on advertising? \n  * Will they focus on more research and development? And if so OF WHAT?\n  * How will they KEEP existing revenue streams? Undercutting competition's prices,  what do previous customers think of them vs competitors? \n* What sort of long term plan do they have if any for a growth from a their expected 3.3 billion dollar funding to a now  `70.4 billion` market valuation. \n\n\nThese are questions which are not answered yet, and If you look at the wiki for the company, all of the information will be about their IPO and valuation at launch and none of it will be about any product, service or asset they have because they don't have any. They are an unremarkable company that has potential to carve out a piece of a field only because the field has so much growth potential.  \n\n&gt; Snowflake Inc. is a cloud-based data-warehousing startup that was founded in 2012. It has raised more than $1.4 billion in venture capital, and is based in San Mateo, California.

In IPOs everything is laid naked in-front of investors when they set the price targets. On [page 13 of their IPO](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1640147/000162828020013381/snowflakes-1a1.htm) they have a whole section listing risk factors, here is  exact excerpts of that section: \n\n\n&gt; We have a history of operating losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\n&gt; We have experienced net losses in each period since inception.\n\nand \n\n&gt; In addition, our platform currently operates on public cloud infrastructure provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure (Azure), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and our costs and gross margins are significantly influenced by the prices we are able to negotiate with these public cloud providers, which in certain cases are also our competitors.\n\n\n\nYou may also be asking \"but they could get bought out\" \n\nDataware houses are not sexy startups that highly innovate, most of the innovation in that field is with the experts in the field, the direct competitors to SNOW\nActually, google or amazon are more likely to just hire their lead engineers at double pay and get everything they could have wanted from the company. If they were going to buy out this company they would have done it at IPO when shares were 75-85$ and asking for 3.3 billion in valuation. \n\n\nDon't get trapped in a long investment if you can't tie up that sort of liquidity for a very long time. I am sure one day this company will wedge itself into a more serious position in the field, but right now during a pandemic that is largely impacting the state this company is from, \n\n this is not an opportunity unless you are getting it at warren buffet prices.",

        "selftext": "In a market with massively inflated valuations across the board (especially so in the technology sector), it feels like a breath of fresh air to see Intel trading at a P/E of less than 10. What I can't quite figure out is *why*.\n\nI know about the 7nm chip delay. I know AMD's 7nm chips are already out. I know Intel has been losing ground to AMD in the desktop market for years now. Yet, the magnitude of these factors has been completely exaggerated by Mr. Market. Intel recently released its 11th generation of CPUs, the 10nm Tiger Lake series, and benchmarks have put their performance up to 30% higher than that of AMD's 7nm chips (that metric comes from the Intel Core i7-1165G7, which isn't even the flagship chip of this generation of processors). However, even if we assume that AMD's 7nm chips are going to finally establish them as the dominant company in the desktop market, so what?\n\nIt may seem odd for me to brush off that particular loss of market share for a company that built itself on desktop CPU sales, but hear me out. Desktop sales have been in decline for years now, with laptop sales almost doubling those of desktops in 2019, and Intel's market share in the laptop market is still over 80%. Intel's management no longer considers it critical to dominate an industry in decline, and I tend to agree with them.\n\nTo offset the loss in desktop market share, Intel has increased its market share in data servers (a rapidly growing sector) to well over 90%. With massive corporations like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google making fortunes off of cloud services, Intel is taking a \"picks and shovels\" approach to profiting off of this trend (during the California gold rush, finding gold wasn't the only way to strike it rich. Many made enormous profits by selling picks and shovels to the miners). When PCs were revolutionizing the world, Intel took this same approach, and in an era when PC sales growth is dwindling, Intel is being proactive about expanding into new high-growth markets.\n\nIntel's current fundamental position has drawn comparisons to that of Apple in 2016, and I agree with the analysis. In 2016, Apple was widely considered to be a company whose upside had run out. They were fighting stiff competition in a saturated, slow-growth market, and their yearly revenue growth had started to reflect that fact. The stock fell out of favor with the market, and at one point fell to a P/E below 10. Any of this sound familiar? It gets better. What the market had neglected to realize was that Apple was still diversifying its product line (the purchase of Beats Audio, the release of the Apple Watch and Apple AirPods, etc.), was still a high-margin earner (net profit margins of \\~21% in comparison to INTC's historical margins of \\~20% and current margins of \\~30%), was beginning to reward shareholders through dividends and massive stock buybacks (INTC pays a safe dividend yielding 2.7% at current prices and is in the process of executing $10 billion worth of share buybacks before the end of this year), was in a great balance sheet position (\\~60% debt/equity in comparison to INTC's \\~50%), and had fantastic ratios (\\~40% ROE compared to INTC's \\~30%).\n\nI'd list Intel's intrinsic value at about $85/share, giving the stock a 40%+ margin of safety at the time of this writing. INTC is currently my second-largest holding, and I'll likely buy more if the share price declines further.\n\nMy primary inspiration for writing this (and the source of lots of my information) was a Seeking Alpha article that I'm not allowed to leave a link to because the auto-mods will remove this post lol. It's titled \"Intel: A Market Leader At A Great Price\" and goes over a lot of the same points as I did, but it's still worth a read imo.\n\nTLDR: INTC's recent price decline is attributable more so to overreaction and irrationality on the market's part than to the company's fundamental situation, which is reminiscent of AAPL's in 2016.",

        "selftext": "**Walmart Due Dilligence**\n\n**PARTNERSHIPS**\n\n\\- Partnership with Instacart\n\nRecently Walmart and Instacart have founded a partnership that will allow Walmart to use Instacart their same-day shipping service. \\[Walmart and Instacart together make up for nearly 50% of the online grocery sales.\\]( [https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GroceryDelivery-chart2png-1024x631.png](https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GroceryDelivery-chart2png-1024x631.png)) Walmart\u2019s vast inventory and Instacart their network and experience will only strengthen their position as the dominant grocery delivery providers, and thus putting more pressure on Amazon.\n\n\\- Partnership with Shopify\n\nIn addition to Instacart Walmart has also partnered with Shopify. This new partnership will allow third-party sellers to directly sell their item\u2019s on the Walmart marketplace. This new partnership will greatly expand Walmart\u2019s inventory while giving small businesses the opportunity to reach a bigger demographic. Walmart is expecting to add 1200 Shopify sellers in 2020. Listing an item on Walmart\u2019s marketplace allows Walmart to pick up some fees and generate greater traffic to the website. Another interesting possibility to consider is the fact that Walmart could be used as a Shopify returns hub, with a Walmart being within 10 miles of 90% of the US population it is the ideal candidate for further strengthening their relation with Shopify and saving both parties a lot of money.\n\n\\- Partnership with ThredUp\n\nWalmart has also partnered with Thredup. ThredUp is basically an online thrift shop for clothes and wearable\u2019s. This brilliant partnership means Walmart can now offer both normal and high-end clothing on their marketplace for an affordable price and expose customers to nearly 750,000 pre-owned items. Who would\u2019ve ever thought you could tell someone that you bought your Michael Kors or Calvin Klein at Walmart.\n\n\\- Google\n\nWalmart has been partners with Google for over 3 years now. This partnership allowed Walmart to enter the domain of voice ordering groceries. Simply ask one of your Google devices to buy milk and it will add milk to your Shopping cart. This Partnership might just be the beginning of a strong bond between Google and Walmart as both companies are interested in competing with Amazon.\n\n\\- Microsoft (+ Possible TikTok acquisition)\n\nWalmart has been partnered with Microsoft for about 2 years with 3 more years to go.\n\nSince the partnership Walmart has been using the full range of Microsoft cloud solutions in a bid to accelerate their digital transformation, innovation and efficiency.\n\n**Acquisitions**\n\n\\- Bonobos, ModCloth, ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, Parcel\n\nLet\u2019s start at the beginning, with these acquisitions Walmart stated entering the e-commerce market in 2016-2017. Sadly as is known none of these are particularly success stories with the companies being sold again, being discontinued or CEO\u2019s leaving. However Walmart learned a lot from these companies and has used this knowledge to further try to expand in the e-commerce market.\n\n\\- Jet.com\n\nThe first big step in the fight against Amazon. When amazon acquired Jet.com it was a clear signal of what its intentions were. Jet.com was one of the fastest growing U.S. e-commerce companies and Walmart acquired them in September 2016. Since then a lot has happened, Jet.com has been discontinued but the knowledge, progress and technology gained due to Jet.com is irreplaceable and has given Walmart a brilliant boost into the e-commerce with their e-commerce sales increasing 29%. Furthermore (ex)CEO of jet.com Marc Lore is now the CEO of Walmart\u2019s e-commerce.\n\n\\- Flipkart\n\nEver heard of the small startup company called Flipkart? Maybe you have not, you should though. Flipkart owns 35% of the Indian e-commerce market, a true giant. Walmart acquired Flipkart in 2018 and ever since then it has been expanding its influence in India and fighting against Amazon for market dominance. This year Flipkart took over Walmart\u2019s 28 Indian stores in order to expand its wholesale growth. Another interesting thing is that Walmart might make Flipkart public within the next 3 years.\n\n\\- TikTok acquisition\n\nSome very recent news of their Partnership with Microsoft is to potentially acquire TikTok. TikTok\u2019s enormous userbase and the current pressure in the US and India have made for an interesting situation causing the partnership to push forward in the bid to acquiring TikTok. In my opinion Walmart has a very decent chance of getting TikTok and making it work. One factor that plays a big role in this is Walmart\u2019s presence in India due to Flipkart. Flipkart is India\u2019s biggest online store for; phones, electronics, books, home appliances, etc. With Walmart having a presence in both countries where TikTok is (going to be) banned might mean some positive things for the future, but for now that is speculation. The acquisition of TikTok would allow Walmart to use its genius algorithm and massive userbase to further promote and integrate its Walmart marketplace.\n\n**Walmart PLUS**\n\nWord is finally out, in September Walmart will be launching its Amazon competitor called Walmart plus. It will give numerous benefits to the user such as; Unlimited free delivery(with 2700 stores having same day delivery), fuel discounts and scan&amp;go a tool to make shopping faster, all for the price of $98 per year\n\n**2 Hour Delivery**\n\nWalmart recently launches its new delivery service, called Express Delivery. This new service will allow customers to place their order online and receive their groceries (for a 10$ fee) within 2 hours. Walmart express delivery is currently available in 800 stores with plans to expand to 2000 stores. In addition to 2 hour delivery Walmart also offers same-day delivery in almost the entire United States.\n\n**5000+ US stores.**\n\nThis is Walmart\u2019s biggest weapon. The thing Amazon lacks the most is physical stores. Walmart has over 5000 stores while Amazon has just over 600 (worldwide!). If Walmart can find a way to combine e-commerce with its enormous physical presence then it could give Amazon an absolute run for its money. Remember that 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart.\n\n**Some other interesting facts to consider.**\n\n\\- 90% of US population live within 10miles of a Walmart.\n\n\\- Walmart\u2019s e-commerce sales are currently up 97%\n\n\\- Walmart\u2019s expansion in Africa, India, China.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion/TLDR**\n\nLet me first state with you that this has been my first Due Dilligence and that English is not my first language.\n\nWalmart is currently the underdog, and not many people are expecting them to properly fight Amazon. However its recent spree of partnerships and acquisitions have been a brilliant and very clear move in the direction of e-commerce. If Walmart fully utilized its massive physical network together when their growing fresh e-commerce, I see no other outcome then for Walmart to grow, grow, grow. Covid has given Walmart customers the push they needed to fully explore Walmart their marketplace, the marketplace that is now starting to fill up with thousands of sellers and endless products. Walmart VS Amazon, here we go, my money is on Walmart.\n\nSources:\n\nInstacart:\n\n[https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GroceryDelivery-chart2png-1024x631.png](https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GroceryDelivery-chart2png-1024x631.png)\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/walterloeb/2020/08/12/walmart-teams-up-with-instacart-to-rival-amazons-fast-grocery-delivery/#3bde97546010](https://www.forbes.com/sites/walterloeb/2020/08/12/walmart-teams-up-with-instacart-to-rival-amazons-fast-grocery-delivery/#3bde97546010)\n\n[https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363507/walmart-instacart-partnership-same-day-grocery-delivery-amazon-whole-foods-rivalry](https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363507/walmart-instacart-partnership-same-day-grocery-delivery-amazon-whole-foods-rivalry)\n\nShopify:\n\n[https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2020/06/15/walmart-expands-its-ecommerce-marketplace-to-more-small-businesses](https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2020/06/15/walmart-expands-its-ecommerce-marketplace-to-more-small-businesses)\n\n[https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/walmart-partners-with-shopify-to-expand-its-online-marketplace/](https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/walmart-partners-with-shopify-to-expand-its-online-marketplace/)\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherwalton/2020/06/15/walmarts-new-shopify-partnership-is-another-stroke-of-digital-genius/#26a4e18e3025](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherwalton/2020/06/15/walmarts-new-shopify-partnership-is-another-stroke-of-digital-genius/#26a4e18e3025)\n\nThredUp\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherwalton/2020/06/05/walmarts-thredup-partnership-is-the-best-digital-move-walmart-has-made-in-the-last-3-years/#265d62952172](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherwalton/2020/06/05/walmarts-thredup-partnership-is-the-best-digital-move-walmart-has-made-in-the-last-3-years/#265d62952172)\n\n[https://www.walmart.com/browse/clothing/thredup-shop-all/5438\\_6272369\\_7404214](https://www.walmart.com/browse/clothing/thredup-shop-all/5438_6272369_7404214)\n\nGoogle:\n\n[https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/02/walmart-partners-with-google-on-voice-enabled-grocery-shopping/](https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/02/walmart-partners-with-google-on-voice-enabled-grocery-shopping/)\n\n[https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/walmart-and-google-partner-on-voice-based-shopping/](https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/walmart-and-google-partner-on-voice-based-shopping/)\n\nMicrosoft

This behavior is  common during market recoveries throughout history. The increase in  darkpool buying supports the idea that we are either at the bottom of  this dip, or nearing it, based on historical DIX numbers during pull  backs and corrections. This is encouraging, perhaps its time to start looking for entries.",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 14th, 2020.\n\n# **Investors will look to the Fed to soothe the market next week, but that may be a tall order  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/11/investors-will-look-to-the-fed-to-soothe-the-market-next-week-but-that-may-be-a-tall-order.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Markets are looking to the Federal Reserve to be a soothing force when it meets in the week ahead, but stocks could remain choppy if the central bank disappoints and as investors focus on the election and the economic recovery.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting is expected to end Wednesday with minor tweaks to its statement and some clarity on how it plans to use forward guidance. The Fed also updates its economic and interest rate outlook, including forecasts for 2023 for the first time.\n*****\n&gt; But Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at Prudential Financial, said the stock market could easily be disappointed because the Fed is unlikely to offer more clarity on monetary policy, such as plans for bond buying.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market is concerned the Fed is not going to give us explicit readings on their plans for monetary policy,\u2033 she said. The Fed\u2019s extraordinary policies have been an important factor behind the stock market\u2019s 50% surge from the March 23 low, and it\u2019s also seen as a major factor limiting the depth of the market\u2019s sell-off.\n*****\n&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the Fed is not likely to tweak much and it continues to buy $80 billion a month in Treasurys. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll do anything to the markets either way,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were volatile in the past week, falling hard, rallying, falling and rallying again. That left the S&amp;P 500 with a weekly decline of about 2.5%, its worst week since June. The harder hit Nasdaq was down about 4.1% for the week, its worst weekly decline since March. The quadruple expiration of options and futures at the end of the coming week could add to the volatility.\n*****\n&gt; Bank of America strategists said the bond market is watching the Fed for any balance sheet adjustments and the changes to its forward guidance, which includes the Fed\u2019s recent tweak in its inflation policy. The Fed changed its policy of focusing on a target inflation rate to an average rate, meaning it may not tighten policy if inflation overshoots its 2% target.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe see risk the rates market is underwhelmed by the guidance provided by the Fed, which would support higher back-end rates and a steeper curve,\u201d the Bank of America strategists noted. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield slid in the past week, touching 0.67% Friday, and it could move higher, meaning bonds may sell-off, if the Fed does not clarify policy around its bond buying program.\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said the stock market is hoping for a dovish Fed. \u201cThe market needs that now because fiscal policy is going nowhere,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; BTIG strategist Julian Emanuel said the market could focus on the fact that Congress failed to make headway on fiscal stimulus, if the economic data begins to disappoint.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales for August are expected Wednesday morning, as the Fed meets. They are expected to rise by 1%, and that should be an important look at whether the lack of enhanced unemployment benefits, which expired July 31, impacted consumer spending. Among other things, Republicans and Democrats could not agree how to replace the $600 weekly payment to the unemployed.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cDepending on the polls and the economic data, the probability of stimulus rises and falls,\u201d said Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOur view is that next week is just going to be lots of back and forth with the potential for a further extension of the range for the downside, if the political narrative gets more inflamed,\u201d said Emanuel. Emanuel expects the market to remain choppy and fall further into the month of October, as investors worry about the uncertainty around the presidential election.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s meeting this week is its last before the election, and analysts expect Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to sound reassuring that the Fed will do whatever it takes to support the economy. Powell holds a briefing after the meeting Wednesday, and he is expected to also be asked about the potential for higher inflation. The Fed has said it is more concerned about disinflation, but recent inflation data has been hotter than expected, though still well below 2%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere is a tug of war between those who say buy chips now because inflation is moving higher, versus those why are saying deflationary forces are still weaving their way into the economy,\u201d said Krosby.\n*****\n&gt; Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, said he expects the Fed to sound reassuring but it\u2019s not likely to discuss a target for bond purchases or the yield curve controls some investors were hoping for. Yield curve control would mean the Fed would try to manage interest rates by targeting its purchases of specific Treasurys. For instance, it may focus on trying to keep longer duration yields lower, and buy the 10-year.\n*****\n&gt; Chandler also noted the Fed\u2019s $7 trillion balance sheet has recently declined by about $100 billion from its peak, and its bond purchases are falling behind the European Central Bank.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMy sense is the Fed is going to keep saying it\u2019s not worried about inflation. Its bigger worry is downside risks. They\u2019ll repeat their call for fiscal stimulus which after this week seems less likely,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Chandler said the stock market could remain choppy in the coming week, but he does not expect a sharp selloff. The dollar could decline, if the Fed sounds dovish, and that is a positive for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI don\u2019t think a 10% pullback [in Nasdaq] has caused enough pain to have people capitulate. This is just an ordinary correction, and we\u2019re going to make new highs,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/N5HwCxp.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/jr7e4gT.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/z7gtiCt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/5tgPKm6Y/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/LUUHMDE.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CWgjO92.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/c37y9mp.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Eau1B5A.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/Mp84zhth/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SHieVRq.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/fTBYdV6v/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/05GY8WnF/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/qMk8gsZR/upgradesdowngrades3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Election Charts You Need To See: Part 1\n\n&gt; First off, our thoughts go out to everyone who was impacted by the tragic events of September 11, 2001\u201419 years ago today. It is a day to reflect and remember those who were lost.\n\n&gt; One of the top requests we\u2019ve had here at LPL Research is for more charts on the election. Over the next week, we will share some of our favorite charts on this very important subject.\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s how the S&amp;P 500 Index performs under various presidents and congressional makeups. The best scenario has historically been a Democratic president and Republican Congress, while a Republican president and Democratic Congress has been the weakest.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.11.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Building on this, a split Congress historically has been one of the best scenarios for investors.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.11.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The best scenario under a Republican president is a split Congress, a potential positive for 2020 that has played out after the massive reversal in the stock market since March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.11.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Looking at the four-year presidential cycle shows that stocks haven\u2019t been down during a year the president was up for a re-election since FDR in the 1940s, another bullish tailwind for 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.11.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s another look at this, as stocks historically have done much better when there isn\u2019t a lame duck president.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.11.20-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Active Managers Do an About Face\n\n&gt; The National Association of Active Investment Managers (NAAIM) has an index which tracks the exposure of its members to US equity markets. Each week, members are asked to provide a number that represents their exposure to markets. A reading of -200 means they are leveraged short, -100 indicates fully short, 0 is neutral, 100% is fully invested, and 200% indicates leveraged long. Two weeks ago, in our Bespoke Report, we highlighted the fact that the exposure index had moved to one of the highest levels in its 15-year history. Now, just two weeks later, these same active managers have reigned in their exposure considerably as this week's reading dropped from just under 100 to 53.1.\n\n&gt; This week's drop was the second-largest one week decline in the index's history and just the 10th time that the index lost more than a third (33 points) in a single week. The most recent occurrence was back in early March in the middle of the Covid crash, and every other prior period where the index saw a similar drop, the S&amp;P 500 was also down every time by an average of 2.3%. Therefore, it's not much of a surprise to see the big drop this week given the big declines in the market. But what about going forward? Do big drops in the NAAIM Index mean a bounce back for markets or further declines?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/091120-NAAIM.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # The Most and Least Heavily Shorted Stocks in the Russell 1,000\n\n&gt; Below is an updated look at the most heavily shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000. Each of these 30 stocks has at least 15% of its equity float sold short.\n\n&gt; At the top of the list is Nordstrom (JWN) with 38.66% of its float sold short. With a YTD decline of 61.86%, the shorts have crushed it with JWN this year.\n\n&gt; With its huge portfolio of office and retail real estate, Brookfield Property REIT(BPYU) has the second highest short interest in the Russell 1,000 at 33.7%. BPYU is down 35.7% YTD.\n\n&gt; There are plenty of other well-known companies on the list of the most heavily shorted stocks. Examples include American Airlines (AAL), Virgin Galactic (SPCE), LendingTree (TREE), Wayfair (W), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), ADT, TripAdvisor (TRIP), Beyond Meat (BYND), and Kohl's (KSS).\n\n&gt; One name that is no longer on the list of most shorted stocks is Tesla (TSLA). When we provided an update on short interest back in February (a pre-COVID world), Tesla (TSLA) had more than 17% of its float sold short, but that number is all the way down to 8.3% as of the most recent filing.\n\n&gt; These 30 stocks with the highest short interest are down an average of 3.01% since last Wednesday (9/2) when the S&amp;P 500 made its last closing high. That's actually a little bit better than the 3.55% average decline for the rest of the stocks in the Russell 1,000. And year-to-date, these 30 stocks are up an average of 0.60% versus an average gain of 0.81% for the rest of the index. That's not much of a difference!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/most-heavily-shorted.png))**\n\n&gt; Below is a list of the 30 least shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000 as a percentage of equity float. None of these stocks have more than 0.71% of their float sold short, and they're mostly made up of more conservative names in the Health Care and Consumer Staples sectors.\n\n&gt; Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) has the lowest short interest as a percentage of float in the Russell 1,000 at just 0.36%. Microsoft (MSFT) -- one of the key mega-cap Tech names -- has the second lowest short interest, followed by Merck (MRK), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Medtronic (MDT).\n\n&gt; Somewhat surprisingly, Amazon (AMZN) is the sixth least shorted stock in the entire Russell 1,000. While AMZN is still thought of as a high-flying momentum name by many investors, its short interest levels tell a much different story, painting it as more of a non-cyclical stock like Pepsi (PEP), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), or Coca- Cola (KO).\n\n&gt; While the 30 most heavily shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000 are up 0.60% YTD, the 30 least shorted stocks in the index are up much more at +8%. This group has MSFT, AMZN, HD, and AAPL to thank for that strong performance!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/leastshorted.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5 Lessons Learned About Rising Rates\n\n&gt; While the direction of the 10-year Treasury yield over the last cycle was decidedly lower, as shown in LPL\u2019s Chart of the Day, there were still six extended periods where it rose at least 0.75%, and in two of those it rose almost 2%. Looking ahead, economic growth below potential, slack in the labor market, and an extremely supportive Federal Reserve (Fed) may limit rate pressure in the near term, but with interest rates already low and massive stimulus in place, we believe the overall direction is likely to be higher.\n\n&gt; \u201cEven in a falling rate period there are lessons from the last cycle about rising rates,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cAmong them: Careful when the Fed stops buying and sometimes the best defense is a good offense.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.9.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; While every economic cycle is unique, the last cycle highlighted these key takeaways about periods of rising rates:\n\n&gt; * **Careful when the Fed stops buying.**  The two drivers of rising rates last cycle were economic growth and Fed bond purchases, also known as quantitative easing (QE). The Fed buys bonds to keep rates down, but the start of Fed buying has actually been the time when rates rise\u2014likely on expectations that the purchases would help strengthen the economy. These periods also often followed large rate declines either because markets anticipated the start of Fed buying or the economy was faltering. The takeaway: unless the economy is really taking off, any rising-rate period may pause for an extended period, or even reverse, when the Fed backs off bond purchases.\n&gt; * **Sometime the best defense is a good offense.** Lower-quality, more economically sensitive bond sectors actually performed well during periods of rising rates during the last cycle. Rate gains were largely driven by economic improvement rather than a large pick-up in inflation, and that\u2019s typically a good environment for sectors like high-yield bonds and bank loans. The downside is that these are much riskier bond sectors and don\u2019t provide the potential diversification benefits of higher-quality bonds during periods of stock declines.\n&gt; * **Don\u2019t expect TIPS to provide much resilience because of their inflation adjustment.** Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are high-quality bonds that have provided a little extra insulation against rising rates compared to similarly dated Treasuries when inflation expectations increased. TIPS prices are adjusted for inflation, but even with the adjustment, they are still very sensitive to rates.\n&gt; * **Investment-grade corporates can both hurt and help.** If credit spreads narrow when rates are rising, investment-grade corporates can post some solid gains in a rising-rate environment, but if spreads are holding steady or even widening, they can be very sensitive to changes in Treasury yields, potentially (although not often) even more sensitive than Treasuries.\n&gt; * **Mortgage-backed securities (MBS)** have not provided as much insulation as corporates, but they also have had less downside. While MBS have certainly outperformed Treasuries during periods of rising rates, they have not performed as well as investment-grade corporates. But they also have come with less downside, losing only 1.4% in their worst performing period compared to a 4% loss during the worst period for corporates.\nWith the Fed still providing strong stimulus and economic growth potentially poised to accelerate, we currently see an increased risk of rates moving higher. We are playing some offense with our equity exposure, which allows us to emphasize a focus on higher-quality bonds. Among bond sectors, we are emphasizing MBS and still prefer investment-grade corporates over Treasuries. History may not repeat, but if it rhymes, this positioning may help add resilience to a fixed income portfolio if rates extend their move off recent lows.\n\n&gt; With the Fed still providing strong stimulus and economic growth potentially poised to accelerate, we currently see an increased risk of rates moving higher.

Below we take a look at the best and worst performing stocks in the Russell 1,000 since the 9/2 high for the S&amp;P. For each stock, we also include its YTD total return and its percentage change from the 3/23 COVID Crash low through 9/2.\n\n&gt; Capri Holdings (CPRI) is up more than any other stock in the Russell 1,000 since 9/2 with a gain of 17.43%. Even after the recent gains, however, Capri -- the holding company for brands like Michael Kors, Jimmy Choo, and Versace -- is still down 52.9% year-to-date.\n\n&gt; Only four other stocks are up more than 10% since 9/2 -- Beyond Meat (BYND), PVH, Virtu Financial (VIRT), and Reinsurance Group (RGA). Interestingly, BYND and VIRT are also up big (~80%) year-to-date, while PVH and RGA are both down more than 35% year-to-date.\n\n&gt; What stands out the most about the list of winners is that only one Technology stock made the cut -- Sabre (SABR). Most names come from the two consumer sectors including cruise-liners like Carnival (CCL), Royal Caribbean (RCL) and Norwegian Cruise (NCLH), Kohl's (KSS), Williams-Sonoma (WSM), Six Flags (SIX), Foot Locker (FL), and Ralph Lauren (RL). Both UBER and LYFT also made the cut with gains of 6% since 9/2. The 30 biggest winners since 9/2 are still down an average of 20% year-to-date, while the rest of the stocks in the Russell 1,000 are up an average of 1.46% YTD.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/bestsince92.png))**\n\n&gt; While only one Technology stock made the list of biggest winners since 9/2, the sector accounts for two-thirds of the 30 biggest losers over the same time frame. As shown below, since 9/2, the six worst performing stocks in the Russell 1,000 and ten of the worst twelve all come from Tech. Notably, though, these 30 stocks that have all fallen more than 12% since 9/2 are still up an average of 5.6% YTD. Were it not for the horrid YTD performance of the Energy stocks that made the list, the average YTD gain would be even higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/worstsince92.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Typical Early September Weakness Recovers Mid-Month Sells Off Month-End\n\n&gt; As of yesterday\u2019s close the market was down more than the historical average performance in September. DJIA was down nearly -3.3%, S&amp;P 500 was down -4.8%, NASDAQ was off 7.9%, Russell 1000 was down -5.2% and Russell 2000 lost 3.7%. Today\u2019s rally looks like the beginning of a textbook mid-month recovery rally However, the second half of September has historically been weaker than the first half. The week after options expiration week can be treacherous with S&amp;P 500 logging 23 weekly losses in 30 years since 1990. End-of-quarter portfolio restructuring, and window dressing can amplify the impacts of any negative headlines.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/75a927aee973e2c31a0d76ff0be15d59/fa78a7e1d90fbdef-fe/s500x750/8f217c04559740d2db6c24b7ea855ecd579ec195.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/Mp84zhth/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/3JGV5KjX/ervol1.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 9.14.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 9.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1LCuH7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  9.15.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/IU3xGVJ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 9.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EOC9Qwy.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 9.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/faX2lNR.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 9.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 9.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/CdwssKa.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 9.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 9.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 9.18.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # FedEx Corp. $232.79\n**FedEx Corp.

        "selftext": "Listen idiots, when the market goes full retard and becomes this volatile, you don't have to become a retard with it. Instead of throwing thousands on hourlies or on retarded OTM FDs expiring this friday, buy 1-2 long term calls or LEAPS. No, your fucking 10/16 or 9/20 calls aint LEAPS. LEAPs are options contracts with expiration dates that are longer than one year. Don't go all in at once. Shit is expensive but much much safer. LEAPS have a juicy delta and theta will be on your side. I know, this is unheard of on this sub but it's a thing. I'd recommend buying a LEAP as close to ATM as possible. Why? So you can sell weekly OTM calls on green days and profit off your fellow retards. You are basically converting your LEAP into a vertical spread and your long leg will act as collateral if shit goes wrong. If this is too technical for you, and are too retarded to google Options 101, just buy OTM 2022 LEAPs. There's a lot of shit on discount right now; $PYPL, $MSFT, $NVDA, $BA, etc. Since we are living on retarded times, be ready to average down when the market is period-red. Sell your average downs when green. Repeat.",

        "selftext": "2 days of rationalizing my S&amp;P500 losses went into this. \n\nI couldn't sleep, work or do literally anything else. I had to summarize what is happening in the market. \n\nTech did really well with Covid because the businesses weren't affected much by work@home. People still easly could buy Apple laptops or use Office365. Trade deals between tech companies were still happening and the only virus internet cares for is power outage. \n\nStonks were going up, high. So high that people got scared and started constantly yapping about a tech bubble. Weeks passed and we were still in the green. It was our trust that drove prices high. \n\nIn the next 10 years or so I don't see people putting a stop to purchasing smartphones or using cloud based product. It is not happening. More people are coming to this lovely planet every single day, by the end of 2030 we will have \\~8,5 bilion people that's 900 milion consumers more. We are still in very early stages of internet companies, they got huge valuations because of the value they provide. Heck, Apple so rich it created a credit card and we will se more of it. \n\nWe have no idea what Amazon will pull out 5 years from now. 15 years from now. WE HAVE NO IDEA. We know people are going to buy homes, take loans and go to vacations. Maybe Microsoft will create a ground breaking software that will replace every postman in the us with Amazon branded drones adding bilions of extra revenue each year? \n\nWe know that world relies on tech today. But how gigantic will it be in the future? We have no idea. \n\nAnd it is scary for old money. \n\nOld money likes to lock in average Joe into 30 year mortgage, put that brand new Sony TV on a 2 year credit payment + that sweet 5k loan for vacations in Paris. \n\nOld money likes real estate index funds, banks and travel industry (pre covid) because all of these businesses brought trilions in value of the decades. Tech is young and can lead the world in the near future. That's why the bears roared. Why bears roar? Cuz they scared.",

        "selftext": "**Walmart Due Dilligence**\n\n**PARTNERSHIPS**\n\n\\- Partnership with Instacart\n\nRecently Walmart and Instacart have founded a partnership that will allow Walmart to use Instacart their same-day shipping service. \\[Walmart and Instacart together make up for nearly 50% of the online grocery sales.\\]( [https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GroceryDelivery-chart2png-1024x631.png](https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GroceryDelivery-chart2png-1024x631.png)) Walmart\u2019s vast inventory and Instacart their network and experience will only strengthen their position as the dominant grocery delivery providers, and thus putting more pressure on Amazon.\n\n\\- Partnership with Shopify\n\nIn addition to Instacart Walmart has also partnered with Shopify. This new partnership will allow third-party sellers to directly sell their item\u2019s on the Walmart marketplace. This new partnership will greatly expand Walmart\u2019s inventory while giving small businesses the opportunity to reach a bigger demographic. Walmart is expecting to add 1200 Shopify sellers in 2020. Listing an item on Walmart\u2019s marketplace allows Walmart to pick up some fees and generate greater traffic to the website. Another interesting possibility to consider is the fact that Walmart could be used as a Shopify returns hub, with a Walmart being within 10 miles of 90% of the US population it is the ideal candidate for further strengthening their relation with Shopify and saving both parties a lot of money.\n\n\\- Partnership with ThredUp\n\nWalmart has also partnered with Thredup. ThredUp is basically an online thrift shop for clothes and wearable\u2019s. This brilliant partnership means Walmart can now offer both normal and high-end clothing on their marketplace for an affordable price and expose customers to nearly 750,000 pre-owned items. Who would\u2019ve ever thought you could tell someone that you bought your Michael Kors or Calvin Klein at Walmart.\n\n\\- Google\n\nWalmart has been partners with Google for over 3 years now. This partnership allowed Walmart to enter the domain of voice ordering groceries. Simply ask one of your Google devices to buy milk and it will add milk to your Shopping cart. This Partnership might just be the beginning of a strong bond between Google and Walmart as both companies are interested in competing with Amazon.\n\n\\- Microsoft (+ Possible TikTok acquisition)\n\nWalmart has been partnered with Microsoft for about 2 years with 3 more years to go.\n\nSince the partnership Walmart has been using the full range of Microsoft cloud solutions in a bid to accelerate their digital transformation, innovation and efficiency.\n\n**Acquisitions**\n\n\\- Bonobos, ModCloth, ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, Parcel\n\nLet\u2019s start at the beginning, with these acquisitions Walmart stated entering the e-commerce market in 2016-2017. Sadly as is known none of these are particularly success stories with the companies being sold again, being discontinued or CEO\u2019s leaving. However Walmart learned a lot from these companies and has used this knowledge to further try to expand in the e-commerce market.\n\n\\- Jet.com\n\nThe first big step in the fight against Amazon. When amazon acquired Jet.com it was a clear signal of what its intentions were. Jet.com was one of the fastest growing U.S. e-commerce companies and Walmart acquired them in September 2016. Since then a lot has happened, Jet.com has been discontinued but the knowledge, progress and technology gained due to Jet.com is irreplaceable and has given Walmart a brilliant boost into the e-commerce with their e-commerce sales increasing 29%. Furthermore (ex)CEO of jet.com Marc Lore is now the CEO of Walmart\u2019s e-commerce.\n\n\\- Flipkart\n\nEver heard of the small startup company called Flipkart? Maybe you have not, you should though. Flipkart owns 35% of the Indian e-commerce market, a true giant. Walmart acquired Flipkart in 2018 and ever since then it has been expanding its influence in India and fighting against Amazon for market dominance. This year Flipkart took over Walmart\u2019s 28 Indian stores in order to expand its wholesale growth. Another interesting thing is that Walmart might make Flipkart public within the next 3 years.\n\n\\- TikTok acquisition\n\nSome very recent news of their Partnership with Microsoft is to potentially acquire TikTok. TikTok\u2019s enormous userbase and the current pressure in the US and India have made for an interesting situation causing the partnership to push forward in the bid to acquiring TikTok. In my opinion Walmart has a very decent chance of getting TikTok and making it work. One factor that plays a big role in this is Walmart\u2019s presence in India due to Flipkart. Flipkart is India\u2019s biggest online store for; phones, electronics, books, home appliances, etc. With Walmart having a presence in both countries where TikTok is (going to be) banned might mean some positive things for the future, but for now that is speculation. The acquisition of TikTok would allow Walmart to use its genius algorithm and massive userbase to further promote and integrate its Walmart marketplace.\n\n**Walmart PLUS**\n\nWord is finally out, in September Walmart will be launching its Amazon competitor called Walmart plus. It will give numerous benefits to the user such as; Unlimited free delivery(with 2700 stores having same day delivery), fuel discounts and scan&amp;go a tool to make shopping faster, all for the price of $98 per year\n\n**2 Hour Delivery**\n\nWalmart recently launches its new delivery service, called Express Delivery. This new service will allow customers to place their order online and receive their groceries (for a 10$ fee) within 2 hours. Walmart express delivery is currently available in 800 stores with plans to expand to 2000 stores. In addition to 2 hour delivery Walmart also offers same-day delivery in almost the entire United States.\n\n**5000+ US stores.**\n\nThis is Walmart\u2019s biggest weapon. The thing Amazon lacks the most is physical stores. Walmart has over 5000 stores while Amazon has just over 600 (worldwide!). If Walmart can find a way to combine e-commerce with its enormous physical presence then it could give Amazon an absolute run for its money. Remember that 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart.\n\n**Some other interesting facts to consider.**\n\n\\- 90% of US population live within 10miles of a Walmart.\n\n\\- Walmart\u2019s e-commerce sales are currently up 97%\n\n\\- Walmart\u2019s expansion in Africa, India, China.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion/TLDR**\n\nLet me first state with you that this has been my first Due Dilligence and that English is not my first language.\n\nWalmart is currently the underdog, and not many people are expecting them to properly fight Amazon. However its recent spree of partnerships and acquisitions have been a brilliant and very clear move in the direction of e-commerce. If Walmart fully utilized its massive physical network together when their growing fresh e-commerce, I see no other outcome then for Walmart to grow, grow, grow. Covid has given Walmart customers the push they needed to fully explore Walmart their marketplace, the marketplace that is now starting to fill up with thousands of sellers and endless products. Walmart VS Amazon, here we go, my money is on Walmart.\n\nSources:\n\nInstacart:\n\n[https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GroceryDelivery-chart2png-1024x631.png](https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GroceryDelivery-chart2png-1024x631.png)\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/walterloeb/2020/08/12/walmart-teams-up-with-instacart-to-rival-amazons-fast-grocery-delivery/#3bde97546010](https://www.forbes.com/sites/walterloeb/2020/08/12/walmart-teams-up-with-instacart-to-rival-amazons-fast-grocery-delivery/#3bde97546010)\n\n[https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363507/walmart-instacart-partnership-same-day-grocery-delivery-amazon-whole-foods-rivalry](https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363507/walmart-instacart-partnership-same-day-grocery-delivery-amazon-whole-foods-rivalry)\n\nShopify:\n\n[https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2020/06/15/walmart-expands-its-ecommerce-marketplace-to-more-small-businesses](https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2020/06/15/walmart-expands-its-ecommerce-marketplace-to-more-small-businesses)\n\n[https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/walmart-partners-with-shopify-to-expand-its-online-marketplace/](https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/walmart-partners-with-shopify-to-expand-its-online-marketplace/)\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherwalton/2020/06/15/walmarts-new-shopify-partnership-is-another-stroke-of-digital-genius/#26a4e18e3025](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherwalton/2020/06/15/walmarts-new-shopify-partnership-is-another-stroke-of-digital-genius/#26a4e18e3025)\n\nThredUp\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherwalton/2020/06/05/walmarts-thredup-partnership-is-the-best-digital-move-walmart-has-made-in-the-last-3-years/#265d62952172](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherwalton/2020/06/05/walmarts-thredup-partnership-is-the-best-digital-move-walmart-has-made-in-the-last-3-years/#265d62952172)\n\n[https://www.walmart.com/browse/clothing/thredup-shop-all/5438\\_6272369\\_7404214](https://www.walmart.com/browse/clothing/thredup-shop-all/5438_6272369_7404214)\n\nGoogle:\n\n[https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/02/walmart-partners-with-google-on-voice-enabled-grocery-shopping/](https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/02/walmart-partners-with-google-on-voice-enabled-grocery-shopping/)\n\n[https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/walmart-and-google-partner-on-voice-based-shopping/](https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/walmart-and-google-partner-on-voice-based-shopping/)\n\nMicrosoft

        "selftext": "Yes we are only going down ~5,10,15% on certain stocks; all over the stock market, but would you guys consider tech still discounted? \n\nYes, tech hit insane ATH for huge companies that are staples in people\u2019s portfolio (Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, Apple, etc) and with the last week, the last months are still active, so if you invested earlier in August you essentially are where you started. Okay no problem it happens.\n\nMy question is - is tech still discounted though? Companies always have ATH and hitting ATH\u2019s are good, and no one believes that Apple will stay stagnant, or Microsoft, or whoever etc, but my question is, if we\u2019re buying these dips that were previous ATH, are these still considered discounted?\n\nThe reason I ask why is because a lot of people have been saying tech is over valued anyway, but honestly every ATH is the new ATH until they pass it, so it\u2019s kinda pointless to say no they just hit an ATH wait more. \n\nLong story short, is tech still discounted even after its exponential growth the past few months? These red days are seen as discount days to buy more.\n\nOr should I just shut the fuck up, cause these are all long term and I\u2019m not selling, I\u2019m just wondering about the dips and buying more and if people still see red days in tech as discounted considering how much green we had the past few months",

        "selftext": "*Disclaimer: I'm a geek and love data. Prepare yourselves for geekery. All data is sourced from SEC 13-F filings, and note that these figures are estimates and may differ significantly due to the recent large moves in tech stocks. For the most part the calculations should be accurate but because institutional ownership is relative to market cap, it can be skewed if there's a big change in stock price compared to the point the holdings data was reported. I've tried to ensure the market cap comparison is current, but it can still be a bit fucky due to the fact that the holdings data is from Q2 and Q3 hasn't been fully reported yet (for example TSLA market cap at the time of the 13F filings for Q2 was $200ish billion, so 97B in holdings represents 48% ownership. The value of those holdings should increase proportionately to the share price so theoretically if you extrapolate it out to today, it should be the same (96.11 million shares * 5 for the split) * 418.32 last close = $201 billion / current market cap of approx $400 billion, yadda yadda ... it's close enough). It's also possible I'm just dumb and my calculations are wrong, so take this w/ a grain of salt and please point out any errors you see! K. Onward, noble gentry.*\n\nSo for something I was working on for my personal website I wanted to create some new little code snippets that would aggregate and display various stats on price performance and institutional holdings. Watching institutional holdings has led to some interesting discoveries in the past, not the least of which is the recent one that [SoftBank basically went balls out and goosed the nasdaq like a WSB YOLO'er (Hey that's you!!)](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-nasdaq-whale-may-have-triggered-the-stock-markets-brutal-rout-claims-report-11599234572).\n\nSince I just finished these little snippets to aggregate this data, I decided to put them to use and check out how institutions as a whole have behaved over the last several years. I don't know if this really provides any interesting findings, but I'll share my thoughts along the way I guess and you can all argue and tell me I'm wrong/stupid/whatever ... it's the internet - have at it. Here's what I found: \n\n#AAPL:\n\nApple's institutional holdings have been pretty static over the last five years, increasing only about 2.47% over that time period. Whales seem to pretty much stick around 58-62% ownership in AAPL. That didn't stop that ownership from increasing over half a trillion bucks in value though, increasing from a value of $425 billion in 2015 to $931 billion in 2020. Over that time, Apple's share price has appreciated 330% from $28 to $120 (split adjusted). Summary: https://i.imgur.com/JhkdjnV.png (Note that shares for institutional ownership are pre-split, so multiply the share numbers by 4 to get current holdings. The percentages don't change) What I find interesting about AAPL is that as a whole, institutions actually decreased their holdings over the last three months (by 137M shares/548M post split) and still \"made\" $276B thanks to the massive tech rally (note I say \"made\" because this isn't profit, per say, it's an increase in the value of their holdings, which obviously (hopefully? lol) they're not going to dump, but it's still interesting to me!) Ok anyway - onto the next:\n\n#AMZN:\n\nAmazon has seen institutions decrease their holdings about 10% over the last five years. Compared to Apple's increase of 2.47% this is a pretty drastic difference, but still the whales hold 287.43 million shares of AMZN worth almost $800 billion, or about 57.47% of the company. Over that time, the value of their holdings has appreciated over $654B despite their decreasing stake, thanks to AMZN's colossal 536.59% return over that time period. AMZN's institutional holdings also decreased over the last three months, like AAPL's, but still increased in value over $230 billion or about 41.45% over that time, compared to the price appreciation in AMZN of only 30.53%. Does that mean they \"beat\" the market? Maybe I'm misinterpreting that data but that's what it seems to suggest to me. Maybe I'm retarded, please share your thoughts there. Here's a summary: https://i.imgur.com/v9Hpccy.png\n\n#MSFT:\n\nMicrosoft is similar to AAPL in that their institutional holdings seem to hover around the same level. It's about 70% owned by institutions and has hovered between 70-75% over the last five years. MSFT has appreciated 388% during that time, while the value of whale holdings has increased from $255B to over $1T (323%). I dunno about you guys, but my portfolio hasn't increased $824 billion in the last five years. Pretty wild. Here's a summary: https://i.imgur.com/dp4YyjW.png\n\n#FB:\n\nFacebook is the first one we're looking at with a significant INCREASE in institutional holdings over the last five years, as whales have increased their stake about 10.42% from 54.85% to the current 65.27%. Over that same time period, Facebook stock has appreciated 215%, taking the value of their holdings from $132B to $422B, an increase of about 219% which is pretty much in line w/ the market. Here's a summary: https://i.imgur.com/UPFiXY4.png\n\n#NFLX:\n\nWhales have been unloading Netflix over the last five years, down about 6% over that time period, but NFLX has by far the highest institutional ownership level of any we've looked at so far, at over 80% of the company valued at $161 billion. Over the last five years the value of these holdings has increased from $34 billion to $161 billion, an increase of 373% vs the stock's appreciation of 443.5%. Summary: https://i.imgur.com/CFX0Bmw.png\n\n#GOOGL:\n\nGoogle is another pretty boring one IMO. It's about 66% owned by whales, a level which has stayed pretty static over the last five years. It's only dropped about 2.5% over that time. Institutions seem to be pretty chill holding onto GOOGL and just maintaining their investment. Over that time the value of these holdings has gone from $251B to $637B as the stock increased 145% from $643 to its current price. Here's the summary: https://i.imgur.com/gd9t0nS.png\n\nAnd last but not least ... \n\n#TSLA:\n\nI found this one the most interesting (I mean really what did we expect lol). Over the last five years institutions have decreased their stake by 13.75%, and 8.56% of that was in the last 12 months. Total institutional ownership right now hovers around 48%, which is worth about $97 billion (96 million pre-split shares, so about 500 million now). What I find most interesting about TSLA is that even though institutional ownership has decreased about 2% in the last three months, as a whole, institutions added about 2.53 million TSLA shares which means the reason that their percentage has decreased is related to the change in TSLA's market cap. I'm not an expert but I suspect this has something to do with the retard-strength rally of 120% over the last 3 months, or maybe the fact that TSLA has gone from a split-adjusted $49 to $418, a whopping 742% increase over the last five years. Here's the summary for that: https://i.imgur.com/Isjf9Gl.png\n\nAlright that's enough for now. I'll do more of these if people like them. Like I said I don't know if this really yields any interesting info but my takeaways from it are pretty straightforward:\n\n1) Whales are unloading TSLA, AMZN, and NFLX on average over the last 5 years, but they own a ton of NFLX relative to the others I looked at\n\n2) Whales are loading the boat on FB. Long FB calls or somethin, I dunno\n\n3) Whales are pretty static on GOOGL, AAPL and MSFT.\n\n4) I'm poor and whales are rich",

        "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/24/futures-rise-slightly-as-market-tries-to-avoid-loss-for-the-week.html\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 opened lower on Friday as Wall Street headed for its fourth consecutive week of losses. \n\nThe 30-stock average dipped 118 points, or 0.4%. The S&amp;P 500 slid 0.3%. The Nasdaq Composite outperformed, rising 0.2% as shares of Amazon, Apple and Microsoft traded slightly higher. \n\nFor the week, the Dow entered Friday\u2019s session down 3% while the S&amp;P 500 has lost 2.2%. The Nasdaq Composite is down 1.1% week to date. \n\nThe \u201csell-off has stabilized a bit over the last few days, but there are still no real signs of strength,\u201d said Mark Newton, managing member at Newton Advisors, in a note. \u201cThus, the trend remains bearish and not much to bet on a rebound.\u201d\n\nWall Street was coming off a choppy session in which the major averages eked out small gains as major tech shares saw broad gains. That outperformance for the tech-heavy index is a reversal from earlier during this market pullback.\n\nThe major averages have had a tough month, with the S&amp;P 500 falling more than 7% in September. The Dow has dropped 5.7% over that time period and the Nasdaq is down 9.4% month to date. \n\nMuch of September\u2019s losses have been concentrated in mega-cap tech stocks, which carry a heavy weight in the indexes. Shares of Apple \u2014 the largest publicly traded company in the U.S. by market cap \u2014 have dropped more than 19% this month. Microsoft, Alphabet, Netflix, Amazon and Facebook are all down at least 9.9% over that time period. \n\nRuss Koesterich, managing director and portfolio manager at BlackRock, said on CNBC\u2019s \u201cClosing Bell\u201d that his team took profits in some high-flying tech stocks at the end of August and then were buying more cyclical stocks during the recent drop for the market. \n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve been trying to do in recent weeks is take the cyclical exposure up a little bit ... it\u2019s not that we think tech is going to roll over. We still like the themes. But on a shorter-term tactical basis, we\u2019re comfortable with the economy, we think we\u2019re going to continue to see improvement, and we\u2019re looking for names that are levered to that improvement,\u201d Koesterich said. \n\nThe state of the economic recovery has become a hot topic in recent weeks on Wall Street, especially after the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg led many strategists to downgrade the chances for another relief package before the election. On Thursday, Goldman Sachs cut its fourth-quarter projection for gross domestic product growth to 3% on an annualized basis, down from 6%. \n\nHouse Democrats are preparing a $2.4 trillion relief package that they could vote on as soon as next week, a source familiar with the plans told CNBC. The bill would include enhanced unemployment benefits and aid to airlines, but the overall price tag remains well above what Republican leaders have said they are willing to spend.",

        "selftext": " \n\nShares in SoftBank retreated again on Tuesday, bringing losses in Japan to 7.7% over two days following reports that the conglomerate had [been making huge and risky bets](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/07/investing/softbank-stock-options-intl-hnk/index.html) on tech stocks.\n\nThe losses have wiped roughly $10 billion off the market value of SoftBank.\n\nHow big are the bets? SoftBank bought $4 billion worth of options tied to underlying shares it had earlier purchased in tech firms like Amazon ([AMZN](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=AMZN&amp;source=story_quote_link)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=MSFT&amp;source=story_quote_link)) and Netflix ([NFLX](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=NFLX&amp;source=story_quote_link)), according to the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbanks-bet-on-tech-giants-fueled-powerful-market-rally-11599232205). The newspaper said that the options generated an exposure of about $50 billion.\n\nThe size of the bets means that SoftBank ([SFTBF](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=SFTBF&amp;source=story_quote_link)) CEO Masayoshi Son is now being called a \"whale\" \u2014 a heavy hitter with the power to move markets on his own. But investors in his company are nervous.\n\nThe options could pay off for SoftBank. According to the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/75587aa6-1f1f-4e9d-b334-3ff866753fa2), which was first to report on the position, the company is sitting on trading gains of about $4 billion. But such trades are also risky, since they could lead to big losses if equity markets keep falling.\n\n**Remember:** The Nasdaq plunged more than 6% in two days last week before the Labor Day weekend. Futures are down sharply on Tuesday.\n\n**Why worry:** Son had been preaching a defensive strategy after his company reported a record 1.36 trillion yen ($12.7 billion) operating loss in May caused almost entirely by his $100 billion Vision Fund, which invests in tech startups.\n\nLast month, SoftBank announced that it would sell more than 1 million shares in its mobile carrier affiliate SoftBank Corp., worth 1.47 trillion yen (nearly $14 billion). That asset sale came on top of plans the firm announced in March to raise some 4.5 trillion yen ($42 billion) by selling assets.\n\n**What's next:** Analysts are questioning the rationale behind the options purchases, and wondering how they fit into a defensive strategy. SoftBank has so far declined to comment, but some investors have seen enough.\n\nAfter all, if investors want to purchase options on US tech stocks, they are able to do so without buying shares in SoftBank. \n\n [https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/08/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/08/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html)",

        "selftext": "I went to financial training seminar while in the military in November 1999 and the lady talked about how stocks like the second coming of christ as the only true path to increase your wealth. I sold all my silver age comics and things and sunk all my savings about 8000 dollars not much into the top growth stocks at the time. Nokia, JDSU, Qualcom (had a 5,000 percent spike that year), and GLW.    \n\n   Cell phones and fiber optics were where it was at in the late month of December Nokia was a 250 dollar a share darling at the time.  Well, one month later my portfolio was worth 1,500 dollars. I had one tech mutual fund i had sunk my whole paycheck of 1,500 dollars that was worth 200 dollars the next month. I held onto it for a while after the crash but by july I put 400 dollars each in XOm and LMT (20 dollars a share)  and rest in a Marvel trading around in the low 1 dollar range after the release of the first x-men movie. Now it was all about biotech companies and Yahoo post crash but i went for marvel. The stock was cheaper than the price of a comic book and  I thought, I was a genius when I sold marvel for 23 dollars a share a few years later such a bad decision. I used the money for my master's degree and housing.\n\nI invested a little in the 2000's, After 9/11 amazon was in the 25 dollar range and I picked up a few hundred dollars worth of it and google when it ipo'd at a 100 dollars a share. Google at the time was saying they were over priced at a hundred dollars a share. The hot stock at the time was Taser now AXXN. So, i've had a few years of success and decided sell my stocks to buy a car and put money toward my condo. I took all my saving and went all in october 2007. My dad convinced me to invest in Fannie Mae she looked so safe and respectable. I bought it at 61 dollars a share and it just started to decline right away but i held only to have my diamond hands cut off a few months later when the stock markets crashed in 2008 and I sold it at 60 cents a share. I was utterly destroyed and swore off stocks and cashed out till the recent market crash in march.  The only thing i had left were the stock certificates from Xom and LMT.\n\nI had developed what this one nurse i work with calls \"I want to see my money in front of me.\" I've had my money just sitting doing nothing in a money market for a decade.  i was just afraid to invest and i'd see facebook Ipo, apple's smartphone or the rise of netflix and think they'd be really good investments but was mortally afraid of repeating what happened twice before. But after the March crash I decided to jump back in and i've done really well these past few months with my early investments in NVDA, Adobe, apple, msft, apple and amazon. i've grown my portfolio from 5,000 dollars to 56k even after apple took a huge dive the past few days. Looking at the valuations of some of these stocks i did get the pangs of fear i felt in 99 and ended up selling nvda, adobe, amazon, msft and put it all on apple with 17k on the side for the future snowflake and air b&amp;b ipo. I did pick up more apple in the morning when it hit 113.  I feel staying the course even after a huge loss is the best long term strategy and avoid fannie mae she's a dirty dirty girl.

        "selftext": "Oil major Royal Dutch Shell and tech giant Microsoft have chosen to extend and expand upon their cooperation to adress the issue that so many people are currently talking about, carbon emissions and climate change. Below you can read the most important highlights of this alliance and what it means for both companies.\n\nHighlights of the expanded alliance include (as mentioned in the article):\n\n1. Shell will supply Microsoft with renewable energy, helping Microsoft to meet its commitment to having a 100% supply of renewable energy by 2025;\n\n2. The two companies will continue working together on artificial intelligence (AI), which has already driven transformation across Shell\u2019s operations through access to real-time data insights, contributing to worker and onsite safety, and delivering efficiencies that have helped reduce Shell\u2019s carbon emissions;\n\n3. Shell and Microsoft will work together on new digital tools so Shell can offer its suppliers and customers effective support in reducing their carbon footprints;\n\n4. Shell and Microsoft will explore working together to help advance the use of sustainable aviation fuels; and\n\n5. The companies will use Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud computing system and data from Shell assets to strengthen operational safety, by improving risk analysis, prediction and prevention.\n\nPersonally I am very bullish on Shell over the long term. They are currently trading at around half their fair value and have been punished way more than some of their counterparts. They are also diversified well into green energy alternatives and look to invest more into renewable energy sources at the cost of their oil and natural gas business. With natural gas however now also gaining a bit of traction and oil demand poised to come back as economies open back up, they are well positioned to take advantage of a variety of trends. Lastly Shell, although it has been cut this year for the first time since WW2, pays a healthy dividend which makes waiting for this stock to give you a healthy return all the more easy.\n\nThis deal with Microsoft might do more for Shell than it will for Microsoft, but it favors both parties and it is alliances like these that can push a company to the next level. I believe Shell is a great investment to make and hold for the coming decade, especially at the current price point.\n\n\nhttps://news.microsoft.com/2020/09/22/shell-and-microsoft-form-alliance-to-help-address-carbon-emissions/",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, September 9, 2020**\n\nStocks shot up today and recovered some losses after sharp declines in big tech stocks. After several red days, shares of Amazon (AAPL), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and other big companies rallied. On a dour note, reopening stocks (travel, cruise lines, airlines, hotels, etc) were down after AstraZeneca (AZN) announced it had its COVID-19 vaccine trial paused. \n\nThe S&amp;P finished 2.08% up, the Nasdaq was 2.92%, leading the day, and the Dow finished 1.68% up. The volatility index (VIX) was down 4.8%, indicating increased risk appetite in traders.\n\nToday, it was announced that AstraZeneca, a forerunner in the development of the COVID vaccine announced a pause of their experimental trial after one patient became more ill, pledging to make safety a priority and take the time necessary to let science prevail. This setback comes in stark contrast to politicians and governments who seem to imply a cure is just around the corner. Shares of AstraZeneca sank 2%, while those of companies competing to develop a Covid-19 vaccine including Moderna (MRNA) and Novavax (NVAX) rose. \n\nUS oil prices plunged nearly 7% today, after Saudi Aramco, the largest oil producer in the world, announced it would be slashing its selling price to Asia and the United States, per Bloomberg. \"Oil demand globally is really sluggish. All of the low hanging fruit from the global oil recovery has already happened,\" said Michael Tran, managing director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.\n\nAsia-Us cargo rates are at the highest since March lows. For bulls evidence of a rebounding economy, for bears activity is fueled by liquidity and the shoe has yet to drop.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* After falling nearly 20% in the week, Tesla (TSLA) stock roared back today, finishing the day 10.9% up.\n* Big Commerce (BIGC) reported earnings today. While estimates were beaten, investors were not impressed. Stock is down 10% today (4% during session (6% after-hour)\n   * EPS of -$0.38 v -$0.43 estimate\n   * Revenue of 36.3 million v 35.6 million estimate\n* Facebook (FB) underperformed the market, finishing a modest 0.94% up. \n* Precious metals were up today, with gold miners ($GDX) leading, up 4.34%. Silver was up 1.58% and gold was 0.92% up.\n* McConnell announced plans to unveil the new $300B relief bill and took procedural steps needed to set up a vote \"as soon as this week.\" Schumer and Pelosi said \"Republicans bill which doesn't come close to addressing the problems and is headed nowhere\"\n* Analyst Upgrades:\n   * $MSFT Microsoft had a nice boost by Morgan Stanley $MS who raised its price target from $230 to $245 \n   * $PTON Peloton had Price Target raised by Wedbush from $66 to $100\n   * $RPD Rapid7 Target raised by $MS Morgan Stanley $55 to $60 (nice stock check it out)\n   * $SFIX Stich Fix initiated by Deutsche Bank at BUY with pt $34\n   * $SPCE Virgin Galactic Upgraded by Credit Suisse from $22 to $24 and NEUTRAL to OUTPERFORM.\n\nNotable Earnings for Tomorrow Thur Sept 10: FuelCell FCEL (BO), Chewy CHWY (AH), Dave &amp; Busters PLAY (AH),  Oracle ORCL (AH), Peloton PTON (AH)\n\nInteresting recent CEO transactions: MNLO $100k, CWH $3MM, VST $750k, BKR $1MM, FRG $4.5MM, IVZ $3MM, SDC $10MM, PLAG $1.7MM",

        "selftext": "I'm not sure I buy this Oracle deal. \n\n**The \"Trump Connection\"**\n\nThe supposed close connection is one guy who hosted a fundraiser for him and is connected to a lady that was part of his transition team. The single fundraiser wouldn't likely represent something significant to Trump, as there are far bigger boosters that Trump seems to be genuinely unaware of ever meeting. \n\nMore significantly, the guy also has ties to China, so the \"connection\" that he might trust would be the woman from Trump's transition team. \n\nThe thing is, Trump was infamously uninvolved in his transition team. When he was told that, before you even know if you won, you put out millions to fund a transition team he balked at the idea. Instead he sat down with Chris Christie and another guy to quickly throw together a list, mostly consisting of people he's never heard of. \n\nThe refusal to pay for the traditional transition process was ultimately the cause of many of Trump's political problems. His administration was plagued from the onset by leaks and administration officials actively working against the administration's agenda. \n\n**The Deal**\n\nThe deal doesn't accomplish anything Trump set out to do. He would have to publicly change the stated terms of his executive order in order for this to be allowed.\n\nIt also does nothing significant to protect American data from spying. Without access to the algorithm, this basically just amounts to an American company with Chinese ties vouching for Tik Tok.\n\n**Trump absolutely prefers a deal with Microsoft**\n\nHe recently redirected the money the US was sending to the WHO to a Gates charity. They're also one of the only companies that isn't being actively targeted by the FCC or the DOJ.\n\nFurther, as Tik Tok's data and algorithm could be used to enhance Bing and finally make it viable MSFT would then pose a serious threat to Google, a company Trump has very publicly opposed due to perceived bias against him. \n\n**China doesn't actually have leverage**\n\nRetaliatory tech tariffs imposed by China would injure companies that Trump largely considers enemies. His proposed change in regulations such that moderated social media would be considered a publisher poses a far greater threat to those companies financially than anything China could do.\n\nFurther, if China doesn't ultimately capitulate Bytedance will lose billions and there will be a looming threat of similar restrictions being placed on other Chinese tech firms. It would likely result in companies like TENCENT taking significant hits. \n\n**Bad Optics**\n\nChanging the terms of his executive order to fit this deal would essentially be conceding defeat. As both candidates have argued that they will take firm stances against China, giving this much ground here would make Trump look incredibly weak. The fact that it might also be spun as corruption to benefit a campaign donor only makes the optics worse. \n\n**Kushner**\n\nThey sent Kushner on CNBC this morning to talk about the deal. While many of you will recognize that name as a significant Trump official, a couple months ago he was quietly demoted as the Trump campaign decided to go in a different direction.\n\nEven in his discussion of the deal this morning, he continued to stress that it will be reviewed by the appropriate regulatory agency and never gave any indication he believes it will pass that review. He had a poker face throughout the interview and had little hopeful commentary. \n\nTL;DR- I don't think this ORCL deal goes through.",

Reports throughout the week said that negotiations were bogged down on the precise details of the deal, including the ownership stakes of Oracle and ByteDance, and control of the recommendation algorithms TikTok uses to promote particular material.\u00a0\n\nOracle CEO Safra Catz was a member of President Trump\u2019s transition team, and Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison threw a fundraising event for Trump earlier this year.\n\nOracle already provides cloud infrastructure to online video services [8x8](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=EGHT) and [Zoom](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=ZM), among other clients, although [Amazon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AMZN), Microsoft and other companies picked up more cloud revenue than Oracle in 2019, according to [estimates](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-08-10-gartner-says-worldwide-iaas-public-cloud-services-market-grew-37-point-3-percent-in-2019) from industry research company [Gartner](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=IT).\n\n[Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=MSFT) had sought to acquire TikTok\u2019s operations in the U.S. Canada, Australia and New Zealand, with [Walmart](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=WMT) as a partner, but on Sunday said [ByteDance had decided not to do that deal](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/14/microsoft-bid-for-tiktoks-us-operations-rejected-by-bytedance.html).\n\nChina and the Trump administration have used tariffs in their trade war in recent years, and their disagreements have spilled over into the technology industry.\u00a0The Treasury Department\u2019s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States [pushed for a sale](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/06/grindrs-chinese-owner-says-to-sell-social-media-app-for-608-million.html) of dating app Grindr by the Chinese company that bought it in 2016, and the committee later\u00a0[looked into ByteDance\u2019s 2017 acquisition](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/29/mnuchin-confirms-tiktok-is-under-cfius-review.html) of Musical.ly, a video sharing app that ByteDance merged with TikTok in 2018, because of national security concerns.\u00a0A Trump executive order in August in August sought to [block U.S. transactions](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/07/trump-issues-executive-orders-to-ban-us-transactions-with-wechat-tiktok.html) with ByteDance, as well as\u00a0[Tencent](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=700-HK), which owns messaging app WeChat.\n\nPresident Trump had taken steps to [ban TikTok in the U.S.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/31/trump-says-he-will-ban-tiktok-through-executive-action-as-soon-as-saturday.html) or make ByteDance [sell the app\u2019s U.S. assets](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/14/president-trump-orders-bytedance-to-divest-from-its-us-tiktok-business-within-90-days.html).

        "selftext": "I took my car in to a local service center for some regular maintenance. While waiting in line, I overhear the 3 service technicians talking about stocks. All Caucasians for those interested. But nevertheless, piqued, my interest was, of course. I leaned over and started dropping some mad eaves. Fellow 1, let's called him Ball D., was asking Fellow 2, Beardfac\u00e8, if he should buy more shares of Tesla and Apple. Before Beardfac\u00e8 could reply, Fellow 3, Slagathor, chimes in with a \"Hell yea! Now's the time to buy!\" Beardfac\u00e8 starts talking about how stocks are only going to go up and how he's made so much money that he bought his girlfriend, now fiance, a new shiny rock. And this goes on for some time of Beardfac\u00e8 and Slagathor convincing Ball D. to add more money with absolutely 0 sentences inserted about fundamentals. To convince him they both opened up their Robinhood accounts and bought more shares. Ball D. fomo's and buys some too right there and then. They then get very excited and Slagathor seals the deal with the following statement \"scared money don't make money.\" \n\ntl;dr - when idiots start spouting \"scared money don't make money\" to other idiots without understanding anything.\n\nNow the actual dip that we all fear is probably some time away or tomorrow, who knows. But I've learned now that when you start hearing this sort of talk in public from Joe Shmoe, it's about to get ugly. When scared money enters irrationally, scared money exits irrationally. People will sell with the same exuberance that they bought with. \n\nComing back to me... I sold all my positions in Apple, Tesla, NVidia, Microsoft, Google, and Boeing. Since the beginning of the year, I've made 200k, with NVDA gaining me 100k of that with a 210% profit. Boeing, made me lose $5000. Which in retrospect, is not at all bad. But I bought it at $170 and sold at $157 (today). Airlines are not going to be recovering anytime soon and buying back in when there are actual orders of planes/profit from BA is plenty opportunity for future gains. \n\nThe current, metaphorical, well is too deep and you don't know if there's snakes at the bottom. With COVID, back to school/work cases unknown, commercial real estate not making money and people about to get evicted, banks making loans to Joe Shmoe's wife's boyfriend so he can buy a house for you because the Fed printer go brrr, the election, no working vaccines, and a bunch of other macro geopolitical issues, for anyone that actually watches global news -  I'm out. Now, with my earnings, not my savings, I'll buy options for things I know will happen. Like what you say? What happens when Apple reveals a new product? Go ahead and correlate product releases and stock price movement. \n\ntl;dr - I sold everything, made money, and I'll play options now like a good WSBer. \n\ntl;dr - I don't risk much and invest very conservatively. As much as I love seeing a 210% gain, that shit don't make any sense and I'm out with some profit until valuations meet MY expectations.",

DLSS is witch craft, able to easily double the FPS in games. it simply makes no more sense to buy amd gpu any more. plus nvidia has better drivers, as always.\n\nand dont forget the Samsung deal. nvidia's able to reduce price on 3000 series cards due to samsung offering very cheap price, rumor is half of what TSMC offers. this means much higher margins when it reports next earnings. the EPS gonna go through the roof.\n\ncloud gaming is booming. its a new industry that analysts expect to grow to 5 billion industry in just a few years. nvidia is including a 1 year free GFN subscription with 3000 series purchase by the way, in order to further kickstart the cloud gaming business. cloud gaming is bascially video game streaming, like netflix. so if netlifx get crazy valuation even though its only a pure play in streaming, why cant nvidia?\n\ndata center business is growing strong. it surpassed gaming revenue for the first time. the AI business will continue to be a secular trend. we're living increasingly in a digital world. think of all the surveilllence system, what do you think power them to do facial recognization? its the GPUs. china's been expanding its police state and will only require even more GPUs to do the tasks and the rest of the world will follow too.\n\nonce nvidia finish the ARM aquision, it will have CPU capabilities just like intel and amd. and ARM cpus has been growing stronger every year. nvidia, being a new player in the CPU space, gonna compete against intel data center business by releasing cheaper cpus. if AMD stock price is skyrocketing coz people think they gonna take intel's cake, imagine what gonna happen with nvidia when people realize nvidia poses an even stronger threat to intel than amd does?\n\nalso, nvidia has superb software. its CUDA ecosystem is industry standard. its very hard to break away from an ecosystem. CUDA is to AI what microsoft office is to office work. amd and intel are not gonna be able to take its place.\n\nnvidia market cap now is only 300 billion. 1 trillion is totally achievable within 1 year, honestly i wouldnt even be surprised if it achieves 700 billion before the end of 2020, especially with the QE environment we are in right now. it will be the first semiconductor company with 1 trillion valuation and it well deserves it.",

In fact, she said that if she had doubled her investment, she could have retired nearly 5 years ago.  This gpt me thinking that considering Big Tech's recent drop lately,that it might be a good time to invest i some TECH Leaps nearly 2 years out.  Inthis case I'd be looking at far OTM as I am only working with a small account, but this struck me as a very safe strategy..\n\nI mean, everyone big investor, small investor, and traders are bullish on AAPL long term.  This got me thinking that this could technically deliver far more returns than a traditional investing strategy..why not risk a small bit of capital on the leveraged gains of LEAP Options?\n\nObviously if AAPL goes under you lose your investment, but it seems like easy money to me as long as you're patient. Am I missing something?  Technically I'd say any of the major tech ckmapnies, MSFT, FB, AMZN, GOOG, TSLA, or even more value brand names like MCD, KO, JNJ, would be worth trying this simple simple strategy with..\n\nAny thoughts?",

        "selftext": "I tried to beat the market and made just 2.8% in unrealized gains until now in the year 2020. Here's how that happened.\n\nI invested a total of $65000 in stocks this year. I transferred money into my brokerage account in 16 installments, each time depositing anywhere from 1k to 10k. Instead of readily putting the deposited money into some kind of ETF like QQQ or SPY, I bought individual stocks like MSFT, AAPL, TEAM, BA, C, etc., without any homework at random times. Sometimes, I held cash waiting for the right time to buy something. During the covid-19 crash in march, I caught falling knife on couple of stocks like BA, C, BAC, etc. Due to those losses, I stopped investing for a couple of months exactly when the prices were at minimum of the year.\n\nAll of this lead to a significantly low % of returns on my investments. Recently, I calculated how much money I could have made if I immediately invested the deposited money on the same day into QQQ, ARKW, XSD, SPY, etc. and that revealed the bitter truth. QQQ would have given me 18%, ARKW 58%, XSD 14.8% and SPY 4.7%. I know what I did isn't smart. I want to know how can I feel less sad about this. \n\nEven after this realization, I tried to create my own ETF sort of thing with some proportions across individual stocks. For ex: AAPL 20%, MSFT 15%, AMZN 15%, NVDA 10%, a bunch of growth stocks at 1.5%, etc. When I backtested my ETF purchase across my deposit intervals, I found that I could have made 37.9% in returns. This higher percentage is stopping me from switching to QQQ. Although ARKW returned 58%, I don't want to put all my money in it because they rebalance their holdings every quarter and they hold TSLA and few other risky stocks at large proportions. Even though TSLA is doing very good now, I am concerned about using ARKW and not having stop-loss on TSLA holdings. If I can control my holdings, I can setup stop-loss and protect myself when risky stocks go down. The problem with my ETF is that it's difficult to maintain determined proportions and stop-loss orders. When I want to invest smaller amounts of money, I have to rely on fractional shares and my brokerage doesn't provide that, so I have to shift to Robinhood or other trading platform. What do you think about this?",

        "selftext": "I have seen post after post about these newbies to the market investing all of their very minimal net worth in FAANG at historically high valuations while unemployment is raging, fear and uncertainty are rampant. The sad thing is most people dabble in the market at some point in their lives and end up selling when they need the money for something else or they sell when the market goes down. \n\nYou may think I am going to say that you are going to vastly under preform with this strategy. I actually think over a 5+ year time horizon, a tech heavy portfolio will do well. \n\nHere is the real reason what you are doing is a bad idea: because most of you are spineless and will sell your entire portfolio the first time we get any serious correction. Tech has run up the most and will likely have the dramatic fall of any sector in a bear market. The reason to be diversified is that you\u2019ll have other holdings that are not falling nearly as much, or sometimes not at all. REITs for example are a great holding because they are not directly correlated with the rest of the market. They also produce income that you can use to add to positions. \n\nMark my words, 60% of these new \u201cinvestors\u201d don\u2019t have the stomach for it. ALWAYS hold at least 10% cash and be diversified across multiple industries. \n\nApple, Microsoft, Amazon Google and Netflix are all tremendous companies, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean their stocks will do well.

        "selftext": "I see Microsoft, Amazon, and Alibaba as the 3 best \"big tech\" stocks out there today in terms of safety vs upside potential. With that said, I am struggling to pick which one I like more, and was wondering if you guys could give me your opinion. I have provided my assessment of each below-\n\n**Alibaba-** \n\nThe \"Amazon &amp; PayPal of China\", Alibaba is growing even faster than Amazon and yet has a Microsoft-level PE ratio of 30. Propped up by the Chinese government and tied to the future of China, which I see as more than likely continuing to grow into a global superpower. \n\nWith that said, it carries obvious risks. Americans need to buy on the Hong Kong exchange or else they risk owning fake shares. Alibaba could be cooking their books and we would have little legal protection/suing power. \n\nThe Chinese economy could slow down or have a Japan-type economic collapse, though that's unlikely in my opinion due to their superior ability to protect themselves militarily from US economic sabotage like we did to Japan with the Plaza Accords \n\nI see Alibaba as clearly the highest risk-highest reward of the 3 stocks listed here. The risks are extreme, but the fact remains that if it was priced like Amazon, BABA would be 300% higher than it is right now. The upside is higher than practically any tech company out there right now...but so is the downside.\n\n**Amazon-** \n\nAmazon has massive and sustainable revenue growth from its eCommerce business, but this is a relatively low margin business in the short term. However, with automation and an improving supply-chain strategy (where they own the entire supply chain and cut out UPS/Fedex), they are gonna start improving margins and revenue growth will turn into actual gross profit. \n\nAWS will continue to grow alongside the broader cloud market, though they will have to contend with stronger competition from Microsoft's Azure and Google Cloud going forward. \n\nI see advertising as a very strong future growth driver as well.\n\nThis is one of the fastest growing companies on Earth in terms of revenue and I see them as a potential world conqueror ala Genghis Khan. \n\nBiggest risk factors going forward are political ones, the CEO is a little too vocal for his own good and he has a target on his back from progressive politicians due to his immense wealth. I don't see any near-term risks facing them, but could easily see them growing to old Microsoft/AT&amp;T monopoly levels and then needing to be broken up. \n\n**Microsoft-** \n\nProbably the most stable big tech company there is. Strongly diversified revenue between gaming industry, cloud, office suite, etc. It would take a meteor striking the Earth for Microsoft to go bankrupt, and maybe even that might not be enough, with how intertwined it is with global b2b and government  contracts. Larger than Amazon, but seems to have no targets on its back politically. \n\nAdditionally, actually offers a decent dividend, and valuation is a little more down to Earth than Amazon's (30 P/E vs 120). Azure is growing rapidly, and they are trimming the fat of their business (such as their retail locations) indicating they want to focus on their winners instead of trying to salvage their losers, something I see as a positive. \n\nWith that said, their actual revenue growth (22%) isn't as hyperbolic as Amazon's (40.23%). In general, they are less imperialistic than Amazon (which sometimes actually serves in their favor regarding avoiding political targeting and allowing for relationships with big companies like Walmart). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR- I see Alibaba as an amazon-esque tech company with ludicrous upside potential, hindered by equally significant geo-political risk factors. \n\nAmazon as an imperialist juggernaut of the tech industry which more than likely has an incredibly bright future ahead of it, but that carries with it heightened risk of political targeting and general risk from having such a high p/e ratio. \n\nMicrosoft has strong growth prospects and a relatively reasonable valuation for a big tech player. However, upside is not as strong as Alibaba or Amazon. I see them as virtually risk free, but at the cost of that aforementioned lower upside.\n\nWhat do you guys think about my assessment? Do you have any opinions on which of these 3 I should go long on, or do you think I should just mix all of them or something along those lines? \n\nCurrently positions relating to these stocks- long Microsoft 20 grand, retirement accounts are split 50/50 between VGT (heavy Apple/Microsoft weighting) and QQQ.",

        "selftext": "Ok i didn't intend on rhyming the title but I like it. Six Flags is a popular amusement park chain with 26 different parks spread across America. When the coronavirus happened, they quickly adapted the necessary changes they needed to re-open their parks as fast as possible and keep them clean.\n\nAccording to [this article](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200526005337/en/%C2%A0Six-Flags-Announces-Extensive-New-Safety-Measures-for-Reopening-Parks) they reopened their park, Frontier City on June 5th. (AMC finally opened their theaters last weekend  [\ud83d\ude34](https://emojipedia.org/sleeping-face/#:~:text=A%20yellow%20face%20with%20eyes,to%20indicate%20it's%20sound%20asleep.&amp;text=Generally%20used%20instead%20of%20%F0%9F%98%AA,to%20Emoji%201.0%20in%202015.)) Six Flags started with a minimal guest policy at first because of corona, and over time are becoming more lenient and letting more people in to keep boosting revenue.\n\nAlso they now use some king of IR thermal imaging device on your eyeball to see if you're healthy. They do that to everyone who goes in the park including employees. The rest of the article goes on about their social distancing policies and being sanitary.\n\nThey've been slowly opening up all of their parks and as of now Hurricane Harbor is the only park that's closed. That leaves them with 25 open parks to rake in those tendies for their earnings date (10/27/20) For people that had the season pass to that closed park, Six Flags guaranteed them free admission for all of 2021. They truly have very friendly staff  and with all the activities to do it's easy to be there literally all day. I've been to Six Flags Great America countless times. Go on the Raging Bull pussy, it's not that bad.\n\nThey had a fairly stable stock for years hovering around the high $50s to the high $60s. As of this very second $SIX is at $25.30 and their stock went up by over a dollar today alone with 3 hours left to go until the market closes. It's moving upwards at a modest pace and headed back towards their old levels. I suspect it will be at least two or three years before we see their old stock prices back again, but they're for sure on the road to success. This is such an easy play. to hop on.\n\nThis might be one of the rare DD you read about BEFORE it moons. \"~~This stock is up over 200% this year and 35% this week alone and you should buy it~~\" There's still time left with this one! Although I wish I learned all this back in June...we're not late to this bus.  \n\nI already bought my position this morning. I would buy two but I'm limited on capital.  Pretty sure I overpaid for the option by $40, but less than ten minutes later I was green. Up $45 right now\n\nPosition: 01/22/2022 $SIX $15c                                  Earnings: 10/27/2020\n\nAlternative Position: 01/20/2023 $SIX $12.5c\n\nI only bought the first position, but if you want to milk the living shit out of this I would go with the alternative position or why not both? I wouldn't skimp on the strike prices and go OTM because you'll wind up with theta deep up your ass. This stock doesn't have a whole lot to run, only up to $50 or so and if you're buying OTM leaps you will have to wait a long time for serious movement to get any decent gains that theta will rob from you anyways These ITM LEAPS only cost around twice as much as the slightly OTM LEAPS. My position above has 0.85 delta, so for every $1 the stock moves my/your contract value goes up $85.\n\nyes these are long-dated positions but you don't have to hold it for very long if you don't want to. I could cash out of this play right now and move on, but I know there's just so much more potential left inside. \n\n[Position Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/JHqo3ga.png)\n\n[My All-Time Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/6lVD2gb.png) ($3.8k buying power is because I just sold my MSFT leap at the beginning of today's dip but I plan on re-entering)\n\nWhy should you listen to me? Yes my account is small, but I only saved $300/paycheck for maybe 6 or 8 months and I played the stock market until the march crash where I was down around 30%. I spent two months learning about options during lockdown and made damn sure I knew what I was doing before trying it. May 14th was the first day I bought options, That's also exactly when the graph starts going vertical. See that peak? That's what happens when you buy TSLA calls pre-split and panic sell them. Also SNAP earnings followed by some SPY puts [\ud83e\udd21](https://emojipedia.org/clown-face/)\n\nAnyway, this is the only play on a company I've come up with where I can confidently share it with everyone knowing that you will make some money. It ain't super fast money but over time it will add up.  Good luck!",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 7th, 2020.\n\n# **The stock market shakeout is likely not over yet, even with Friday\u2019s comeback  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/04/the-stock-market-shakeout-is-likely-not-over-yet-even-with-fridays-comeback.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The tech wreck is probably not over, despite Friday\u2019s market comeback.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts expect the shakeout in stocks to continue after the long Labor Day weekend, especially in technology names and the Nasdaq, areas of the market that notched the sharpest gains.\n*****\n&gt; After August\u2019s 7% gain in the S&amp;P 500, stocks started September strong, and then just as quickly rolled over. The Nasdaq lost 5% Thursday and was down sharply Friday but pared losses to decline 1.5%. The S&amp;P 500 was down about 2.3% for the week, even after a 3.5% loss Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think this is a good wake-up call and a reminder that there are risks out there,\u201d said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management. \u201cIn August, we did take a little bit off the table.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Analysts expect the week ahead to be busy, with holidays ending and more market pros back at their desks. There is some economic data, most importantly Friday\u2019s consumer price index. The reading on consumer inflation is expected to show little change in core inflation with forecasts for a gain of just 0.2% in August, or 1.6% year over year.\n*****\n&gt; # Froth blowing off\n&gt; The stock sell-off came as market pros were becoming increasingly wary of froth in the market, particularly in tech and momentum names. On Friday, it was revealed that SoftBank was behind billions in large options bets on individual tech stocks, like Amazon, Microsoft, Apple and Tesla. News reports said the trades were made over the past month, and SoftBank had been building unusually large positions in call options, or those that bet the prices of underlying stocks would rise.\n*****\n&gt; One analyst said the fact that SoftBank was \u201cgunning the market\u201d makes him worry that there is more selling to come in Nasdaq names. As SoftBank bought call options, the sellers had to buy stocks, conceivably driving up prices in a trading feedback loop.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s just a trip to the casino,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. \u201cIf they\u2019re supposed to be an investment company taking a long-term horizon, then trying to juice your short-term return through options, you\u2019ve turned into a hedge fund.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; JPMorgan strategists said they expect the market to recover gradually, but there are still presidential election uncertainties looming in the next couple of months.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe significant reduction in previously extreme long positions in Nasdaq by momentum traders should allow the equity market to recover over the coming weeks, as happened after the June 11th correction,\u201d noted JPMorgan analysts. \u201cBut a repeat of the strong gains seen during July and August is less likely over the next two months.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Grohowski said there could be more selling in the tech and internet companies, or those that were viewed did well as workers stayed home and the economy was shutdown. \u201cIt\u2019s not the start of a big lasting correction, but a forewarning the next couple of weeks and months are going to be choppy. I think it\u2019s going to be a sideways kind of market,\u201d Grohowski said. He added the market could be choppy in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re a little more cautious, not to mention the market is trading at 23 times our earnings estimates for 2021,\u201d said Grohowski. He said the fact there is about $4.5 trillion in money market funds is a bullish signm since that money could find its way into the stock market.\n*****\n&gt; Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivatives strategy at BTIG, said the S&amp;P 500 could dip to its 200-day moving average, or 3,092, before rebounding, which would be about a 15% move in total.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI don\u2019t think the sell-off is over. Nasdaq is up 83%s since March 23, the S&amp;P is up 63%,\u201d said Emanuel.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/34qCxpv.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/1u5feMS.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/WfvTGox.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/sDw87zF7/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bUFp72p.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cgvDyfD.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SJ4plDu.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/g1WP8F6.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/GtFbRTWy/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NcrK823.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/NkAezup.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/D3X10mF.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Caps Best Day After Labor Day\n\n&gt; In the last 21 years, only Russell 2000 has registered an average gain of 0.16% on the Tuesday after the long Labor Day weekend. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have struggled with negative average performance. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have been up five of the last eight years, but DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 all have fallen for the last three years on Tuesday. On Wednesday the market\u2019s performance has been varied. DJIA has performed the best, up 76.2% of the time with an average gain of 0.25%. S&amp;P 500 is worst, up only 42.9% of the time with an average gain of 0.13%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/1422a049f2b0dbca39b1543c5cff0a42/172c7870552d9912-60/s500x750/ff92c03e01c3e886a523a64381a9c44745538da2.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Big August: Bullish or Bearish?\n\n&gt; Big August 2020 logged the 4th biggest August percent gain for the S&amp;P 500 since 1949 and the 6th biggest since 1930. But, is this bullish or bearish for the market in the coming months? Hopefully the table below provides some perspective by comparing the previous Top 20 S&amp;P 500 Augusts since 1949 to July, September, Q4 and the succeeding \u201cBest Six Months\u201d November-April.\n\n&gt; Subsequent Septembers were down 15 of 20 years for an average loss of -1.0% (median loss of -0.7%). Q4 is positive with gains in 13 of the 20 years for an average gain of 1.0% (median gain of 3.0%). The following Best Six Months are more bullish, up 16 of the 20 years with an average gain of 7.6% (median gain of 8.5%).\n\n&gt; Looking at just the 7 years that were preceded by big Julys shows some improvement for September but Q4s are worse, containing the largest Q4 losses. Back-to-back big Julys and big Augusts were followed by improved Best Six Months results, up in all 7 instances with a higher average and median gain and the top gain.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/7bd7299f2e7714adc709577da928964e/bd54fb998db4a9e1-46/s1280x1920/3363ff03bfc2dead6e88b387771b6bbad2aafece.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Analyzing the Jobs Report\n\n&gt; The jobs market remains strong, as the August nonfarm payrolls came in at a solid 1.37 million jobs created, right in line with expectations. This was the fourth consecutive month of gains, up 10.6 million over this time frame. In March and April more than 22 million jobs were lost, so we still aren\u2019t quite to half of the jobs recovered though.\n\n&gt; This was the second consecutive month there was a very weak ADP private payrolls number ahead of the monthly jobs report, adding to the worries, but the actual nonfarm payroll number was once again quite solid. Don\u2019t forget, just yesterday we saw initial jobless claims come in at 881,000, the lowest number since the week ending March 14, another improving employment number.\n\n&gt; The big surprise in today\u2019s report though was the unemployment rate fell to 8.4%, from 10.2% last month and an expected 9.8%. This was the lowest unemployment rate since 4.4% in March.\n\n&gt; \u201cThis was an impressive report and once again showed the economy remained quite resilient,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut 8% unemployment is 8% unemployment, so let\u2019s not get too excited, but we\u2019ll still take this improving trend in the employment picture.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, even though more than 10 million jobs have been created in the past four months, the sad truth is we are still quite a long way from recovering all the jobs lost due to the pandemic. In fact, looking at previous cycles, it has taken years for all of the lost jobs to come back and this time doesn\u2019t appear any different.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Blog-9.4.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; One thing to consider is could this solid number make it harder for Washington to agree on the next stimulus plan? We are watching this closely, but with the two sides still close to a trillion dollars apart, today\u2019s report will likely do little to help the two sides come to a quick resolution.\n\n&gt; Last, don\u2019t forget that stocks gained more than 60% in less than six months, so some weakness would be perfectly normal. In fact, looking at the two previous strongest starts to a bull market ever (\u201982 and \u201909) both saw some weakness right around now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Blog-9.4.20-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3 Charts To Watch If You Are Bullish\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index just closed the door on its best August since 1986, making new all-time highs along the way, while also closing up five months in a row.\n\n&gt; First things first, make no mistake about it; this is a new bull market. That of course doesn\u2019t mean it will last years like previous bull markets, but a nearly 57% gain in 5 months is what we\u2019d classify as a bull market.\n\n&gt; Here are all the bull markets going back to the Great Depression and where this one ranks.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.2.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Now let\u2019s dig into the 5 month win streak. It is quite rare for stocks to gain from April through August, as the summer months tend to be somewhat tricky. Yet, we found there were six other years that saw these 5 months all close higher and the rest of the year was higher five times, with some solid returns in there. In fact, the only year that was lower the rest of the year was 2018, mainly due to the Fed policy mistake in December 2018.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.2.20-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cWhat might surprise many investors is 5 month win streaks are actually incredibly bullish going forward,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIn fact, a year after a 5 month win streak has seen the S&amp;P 500 higher 25 of the past 26 times.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 Index gained more than 35% during this 5 month win streak, the most ever. Yet, the future gains after 5 month win streaks is very impressive, higher 25 out of 26 times a year later. An object in motion tends to stay in motion and this sure seems to be the case here.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.2.20-blog-chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Historic August Opens Door To Worst Month Of The Year\n\n&gt; What a month August has been so far, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up more than 7%, for the best August since 1984. Not to be outdone, this is the first time in history August saw two separate 6-day (or more) win streaks. Last, with one day to go, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 16 days so far this month, for the most since 16 in April 2019. Meanwhile, it is the most up days for any August since 2003.\n\n&gt; \u201cWell, 2020 has laughed at many of these things, but be aware September is indeed the worst month of the year on average,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut what caught our attention was both September and October have a negative return during election years, with October the worst month of the year. Could investors get election jitters again in 2020?\u201d\n\n&gt; As show in the LPL Chart of the Day, September tends to be a weak month. In fact, it is the weakest month on average since 1950. Additionally, the last two times August was up more than 5% were 1986 and 2000; the S&amp;P 500 fell 8.5% and 5.4% in September those years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Breaking things down by just an election year shows that August actually tends to be strong. That obviously played out this year, but now will the weakness we usually see in September and October play out?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.31.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Finally, after today, the S&amp;P 500 will be up 5 consecutive months. Looking at the other years that saw a similar summer rallies, there tended to be more strength the final 4 months of the year, with only the Federal Reserve policy mistake of December 2018 blemishing this impressive track record.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.31.20-Blog-Chaert-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Yes, this record equity run is extremely stretched, but we would continue to use any pullbacks as an opportunity to add to longer-term core equity holdings, as the economy continues to come back quicker than most expected.\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/GtFbRTWy/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/2yRCg7KY/ervol1.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 9.7.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.

        "selftext": "Mega-cap tech stocks like Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL?p=AAPL&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN?p=AMZN&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT?p=MSFT&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)), Facebook ([FB](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FB?p=FB&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)), and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA?p=TSLA&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)) (if you consider that a tech stock) have been hammered over the past few days, pulling down the S&amp;P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq.\u00a0\n\nDuring late afternoon trading Tuesday, Tesla was down nearly 20% amid news that it won\u2019t be part of the S&amp;P 500. Meanwhile, Facebook was down nearly 4%, Amazon and Microsoft over 4%, and Apple over 5%. And on Tuesday, workplace collaboration app Slack ([WORK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WORK/)) saw its stock plummet over 15% in after-hours trading [following a disappointing earnings report](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/slack-second-quarter-earnings-work-from-home-202052097.html).\n\nThat\u2019s led to rumblings that the market \u2014 which has been bounced around by these and other massive tech names \u2014 is careening toward a second coming of the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s that came crashing down 20 years ago. That era was best epitomized by Pets.com, which, despite a flashy advertising campaign, flamed out just 9 months after its initial public offering.\n\n But according to Capital Economics\u2019 senior markets economist Oliver Jones, the rapid growth in tech stocks is different from the dot-com bubble for two reasons \u2014 most big-name tech stocks are fundamentally sound companies, and, despite recent volatility, tech stocks have provided a safe haven as other industries have faltered amid the pandemic.\n\n## Tech firms are delivering on fundamentals\n\n[As Jones writes in a research note](https://www.capitaleconomics.com/clients/publications/capital-daily/capital-daily-publication/what-options-can-tell-us-about-the-latest-swings-in-stock-markets/?tk=c63709907946e8cbf7b30754fbfa76d993088517), one of the key differences between the dot-com bubble and the current Big Tech market leaders is that, unlike many of those first-generation websites that took off, firms like Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft have solid fundamentals.\n\n\u201cWhile options market shenanigans may have contributed a bit lately, the main catalyst for their rally is simply the fact that their businesses have done extremely well, in both absolute and relative terms, during the coronavirus crisis. That has not changed in the past week,\u201d Jones wrote in note.\n\nThe tech firms aren\u2019t just making money \u2014 they\u2019re doing so on a sustained basis and cruising past their prior year earnings even amid a global pandemic crippling other parts of the economy.\n\n\u201cBears will start to make comparisons to the \\[dot-com bubble\\] of the late nineties,\u201d David Nelson, chief strategist of Belpointe Asset Management, wrote in a note Tuesday. \u201cAs a veteran of that war I can tell you there's little resemblance. While valuations are stretched most of the big cap secular growth stocks are profitable. That was not the case in 2000.\u201d\n\n Take Apple. [In the second quarter of 2020](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-q2-earnings-2020-203115363.html), the pandemic shuttered production facilities in China and then forced it to close stores around the world outside of Mainland China. The company still managed to increase revenue year-over-year by 1% to $58.3 billion. [In Q3 2020](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-q3-earnings-2020-203224360.html), the company saw revenue grow 11% year-over-year to $59.7 billion.\n\nAmazon and Microsoft, meanwhile, have already been on a roll thanks to the performance of their cloud platforms as the pandemic spurs demand for such services. Amazon, of course, has also benefited immensely thanks to its positioning as a lifeline for essential goods when many people were stuck in their homes in the early portion of the pandemic.\n\nGoogle\u2019s parent Alphabet was the outlier, with revenue decreasing year-over-year [in Q2 2020](https://www.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-googl-q2-earnings-revenues-214509856.html) by 2%, partly due to a pullback in ad sales.\n\n## The tech industry has been a bright spot despite recent volatility\n\nThose performance metrics come as entire swaths of the economy have been decimated by the coronavirus pandemic including the hotel business and airlines. STR, [a data analytics firm for the hospitality industry](https://str.com/press-release/str-us-hotel-results-week-ending-29-august), found the U.S. hotel occupancy was down 27% year-over-year for the week ending Aug. 29. What\u2019s more, revenue per room was off 44.5%.\n\nThe airline industry has laid off thousands, as consumers either avoid airports entirely or are unable to travel internationally. Airlines including American ([AAL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAL?p=AAL&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)), Delta ([DAL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DAL?p=DAL&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)), and United ([UAL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/UAL?p=UAL&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)) have even gone as far as to eliminate change fees on domestic flights to further entice consumers to fly.\n\nThe restaurant industry has been similarly impacted by the virus, first by shutdowns and then by an inability to host in-door dining in some states.\n\nAs Jones explains, there\u2019s little else for investors to be excited about outside of Big Tech. According to his note, there\u2019s been no surge in call options for equity indices, indicating investors were willing to buy, while there has been a slight increase in put volumes, indicating investors are willing to sell if the price is right.\n\n\u201cThis suggests that investors\u2019 primary concern has been protecting themselves against broad-based weakness, the opposite of the caution-to-the-wind behavior you might expect to see in a bubble,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn other words, investors have likely been looking at tech as a safe haven while other industries struggled amid the pandemic. Now, they\u2019re looking to claim the profits they\u2019ve earned in the interim.\n\nSo don\u2019t break out those Pets.com sock puppets just yet.\n\n [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fears-of-new-dot-com-bubble-overblown-205319203.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fears-of-new-dot-com-bubble-overblown-205319203.html)",

        "selftext": "Oracle Corp. ORCL +5.49% won the bidding for the U.S. operations of the video-sharing app TikTok, people familiar with the matter said, beating out Microsoft Corp. MSFT +1.90% in a high-profile deal to salvage a social-media sensation that has been caught in the middle of a geopolitical standoff.\n\nOracle is set to be announced as TikTok\u2019s \u201ctrusted tech partner\u201d in the U.S., and the deal is likely not to be structured as an outright sale, the people said.\n\nThe next step is for the White House and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. to approve the deal, said one of the people, adding that the participants believe it satisfies the concerns around data security that have been previously raised by the U.S. government.\n\nOn Monday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed that his office received a bid proposal from Oracle for TikTok\u2019s operations over the weekend and said that the Treasury-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. would review it this week.\n\n\u201cWe will be reviewing that at the CFIUS committee this week and then will be making a recommendation to the president and reviewing it with him,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said on CNBC. \u201cFrom our standpoint, we\u2019ll need to make sure that the code is, one, secure, Americans\u2019 data is secure, that the phones are secure and we\u2019ll be looking to have discussions with Oracle over the next few days with our technical teams.\u201d\n\nMr. Mnuchin also said the Oracle deal includes a commitment to establish TikTok as a global company headquartered in the U.S., which he said would mean 20,000 new jobs.\n\nThe Treasury secretary said he wouldn\u2019t go into all the details of the plan, but clarified that the deadline for the sale of TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations is Sept. 20.\n\nThe move by TikTok\u2019s parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd., comes days after the Chinese government threw negotiations into doubt when it issued new export restrictions late last month on the kind of artificial intelligence technology TikTok uses. The algorithms, which determine the videos served to users and are seen as TikTok\u2019s secret sauce, were considered part of the deal negotiations up until the Chinese policy change raising questions among the parties involved in negotiations over how to value the social-media business.\n\nThe structure of Oracle\u2019s deal wasn\u2019t immediately known, including whether it includes transfer of the algorithms.\n\nTwo people familiar with the Oracle deal said it was more appropriate to call it a partnership, rather than an acquisition, suggesting that there wasn\u2019t an exchange of significant assets. At least some of ByteDance\u2019s existing investors, including U.S. investment firms Sequoia Capital and General Atlantic, will get stakes in the venture as part of the deal, said people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe possibility that a deal might not involve an outright sale was previously reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nPresident Trump has said repeatedly that he would shut down TikTok in the U.S. if it isn\u2019t sold to an American company. In an Aug. 6 executive order, the White House gave ByteDance a 45-day deadline before it would ban the app, which the Trump administration says poses an economic and national-security threat to U.S. interests, if it isn\u2019t sold to a U.S. buyer.\n\nMicrosoft, which had teamed up with Walmart Inc., earlier Sunday said in a statement that it was notified earlier in the day of the decision by ByteDance.\n\n\u201cWe are confident our proposal would have been good for TikTok\u2019s users, while protecting national security interests,\u201d the statement said. \u201cTo do this, we would have made significant changes to ensure the service met the highest standards for security, privacy, online safety, and combatting disinformation, and we made these principles clear in our August statement.\u201d\n\nDOES ORACLE\u2019S WINNING BID AVERT A BAN?\n\nA look at the state of play for the video app\u2019s ownership and the prospects for a deal.\n\nIn a statement late Sunday, Walmart suggested it is considering joining the Oracle group, saying it is continuing \u201cdiscussions with ByteDance leadership and other interested parties.\u201d\n\nWhile China\u2019s recently announced trade restrictions made acquiring TikTok\u2019s algorithm tricky, Microsoft remained committed to acquiring the app\u2019s powerful suggestion algorithms, said a person familiar with the matter. Without outright purchase of the algorithms, Microsoft wouldn\u2019t be able to follow through with its stated commitment to national security issues.\n\nOracle\u2019s interest in TikTok is primarily driven by kick-starting its fledgling cloud-computing business, which remains far behind market leaders Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s plans were more ambitious than Oracle, said one person. Owning TikTok would help Microsoft have more presence among everyday consumers, an area it had mostly abandoned to chase after corporate users with the exception of its Xbox gaming business. TikTok would also give Microsoft a treasure trove of data on young and mostly female users, an area it doesn\u2019t have much insight into now.\n\nThe New York Times reported earlier that Microsoft had been notified of the ByteDance decision.\n\nTikTok has soared to around 100 million monthly users in the U.S., from about 11 million in early 2018, and they are considered among the most lucrative in the app\u2019s global user base of about 689 million, though the app still loses money.\n\nOracle wasn\u2019t as obvious a winner in the race for TikTok as Microsoft. While both tech companies have sizable cloud-computing operations and technical capabilities, Oracle is mainly focused on serving business clients and has virtually no experience running a social-media platform or other major consumer-facing business. Microsoft is an even bigger player in business computing but also owns the LinkedIn social-media site and the Xbox videogame business. It also is a much bigger company and has about $136 billion of cash, some three times what Oracle has on hand.",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 14th, 2020.\n\n# **Investors will look to the Fed to soothe the market next week, but that may be a tall order  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/11/investors-will-look-to-the-fed-to-soothe-the-market-next-week-but-that-may-be-a-tall-order.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Markets are looking to the Federal Reserve to be a soothing force when it meets in the week ahead, but stocks could remain choppy if the central bank disappoints and as investors focus on the election and the economic recovery.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting is expected to end Wednesday with minor tweaks to its statement and some clarity on how it plans to use forward guidance. The Fed also updates its economic and interest rate outlook, including forecasts for 2023 for the first time.\n*****\n&gt; But Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at Prudential Financial, said the stock market could easily be disappointed because the Fed is unlikely to offer more clarity on monetary policy, such as plans for bond buying.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market is concerned the Fed is not going to give us explicit readings on their plans for monetary policy,\u2033 she said. The Fed\u2019s extraordinary policies have been an important factor behind the stock market\u2019s 50% surge from the March 23 low, and it\u2019s also seen as a major factor limiting the depth of the market\u2019s sell-off.\n*****\n&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the Fed is not likely to tweak much and it continues to buy $80 billion a month in Treasurys. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll do anything to the markets either way,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were volatile in the past week, falling hard, rallying, falling and rallying again. That left the S&amp;P 500 with a weekly decline of about 2.5%, its worst week since June. The harder hit Nasdaq was down about 4.1% for the week, its worst weekly decline since March. The quadruple expiration of options and futures at the end of the coming week could add to the volatility.\n*****\n&gt; Bank of America strategists said the bond market is watching the Fed for any balance sheet adjustments and the changes to its forward guidance, which includes the Fed\u2019s recent tweak in its inflation policy. The Fed changed its policy of focusing on a target inflation rate to an average rate, meaning it may not tighten policy if inflation overshoots its 2% target.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe see risk the rates market is underwhelmed by the guidance provided by the Fed, which would support higher back-end rates and a steeper curve,\u201d the Bank of America strategists noted. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield slid in the past week, touching 0.67% Friday, and it could move higher, meaning bonds may sell-off, if the Fed does not clarify policy around its bond buying program.\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said the stock market is hoping for a dovish Fed. \u201cThe market needs that now because fiscal policy is going nowhere,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; BTIG strategist Julian Emanuel said the market could focus on the fact that Congress failed to make headway on fiscal stimulus, if the economic data begins to disappoint.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales for August are expected Wednesday morning, as the Fed meets. They are expected to rise by 1%, and that should be an important look at whether the lack of enhanced unemployment benefits, which expired July 31, impacted consumer spending. Among other things, Republicans and Democrats could not agree how to replace the $600 weekly payment to the unemployed.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cDepending on the polls and the economic data, the probability of stimulus rises and falls,\u201d said Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOur view is that next week is just going to be lots of back and forth with the potential for a further extension of the range for the downside, if the political narrative gets more inflamed,\u201d said Emanuel. Emanuel expects the market to remain choppy and fall further into the month of October, as investors worry about the uncertainty around the presidential election.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s meeting this week is its last before the election, and analysts expect Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to sound reassuring that the Fed will do whatever it takes to support the economy. Powell holds a briefing after the meeting Wednesday, and he is expected to also be asked about the potential for higher inflation. The Fed has said it is more concerned about disinflation, but recent inflation data has been hotter than expected, though still well below 2%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere is a tug of war between those who say buy chips now because inflation is moving higher, versus those why are saying deflationary forces are still weaving their way into the economy,\u201d said Krosby.\n*****\n&gt; Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, said he expects the Fed to sound reassuring but it\u2019s not likely to discuss a target for bond purchases or the yield curve controls some investors were hoping for. Yield curve control would mean the Fed would try to manage interest rates by targeting its purchases of specific Treasurys. For instance, it may focus on trying to keep longer duration yields lower, and buy the 10-year.\n*****\n&gt; Chandler also noted the Fed\u2019s $7 trillion balance sheet has recently declined by about $100 billion from its peak, and its bond purchases are falling behind the European Central Bank.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMy sense is the Fed is going to keep saying it\u2019s not worried about inflation. Its bigger worry is downside risks. They\u2019ll repeat their call for fiscal stimulus which after this week seems less likely,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Chandler said the stock market could remain choppy in the coming week, but he does not expect a sharp selloff. The dollar could decline, if the Fed sounds dovish, and that is a positive for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI don\u2019t think a 10% pullback [in Nasdaq] has caused enough pain to have people capitulate. This is just an ordinary correction, and we\u2019re going to make new highs,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/N5HwCxp.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/jr7e4gT.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/z7gtiCt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/5tgPKm6Y/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/LUUHMDE.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CWgjO92.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/c37y9mp.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Eau1B5A.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SHieVRq.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/fTBYdV6v/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/05GY8WnF/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/qMk8gsZR/upgradesdowngrades3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Election Charts You Need To See: Part 1\n\n&gt; First off, our thoughts go out to everyone who was impacted by the tragic events of September 11, 2001\u201419 years ago today. It is a day to reflect and remember those who were lost.\n\n&gt; One of the top requests we\u2019ve had here at LPL Research is for more charts on the election. Over the next week, we will share some of our favorite charts on this very important subject.\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s how the S&amp;P 500 Index performs under various presidents and congressional makeups. The best scenario has historically been a Democratic president and Republican Congress, while a Republican president and Democratic Congress has been the weakest.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.11.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Building on this, a split Congress historically has been one of the best scenarios for investors.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.11.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The best scenario under a Republican president is a split Congress, a potential positive for 2020 that has played out after the massive reversal in the stock market since March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.11.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Looking at the four-year presidential cycle shows that stocks haven\u2019t been down during a year the president was up for a re-election since FDR in the 1940s, another bullish tailwind for 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.11.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s another look at this, as stocks historically have done much better when there isn\u2019t a lame duck president.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.11.20-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Active Managers Do an About Face\n\n&gt; The National Association of Active Investment Managers (NAAIM) has an index which tracks the exposure of its members to US equity markets. Each week, members are asked to provide a number that represents their exposure to markets. A reading of -200 means they are leveraged short, -100 indicates fully short, 0 is neutral, 100% is fully invested, and 200% indicates leveraged long. Two weeks ago, in our Bespoke Report, we highlighted the fact that the exposure index had moved to one of the highest levels in its 15-year history. Now, just two weeks later, these same active managers have reigned in their exposure considerably as this week's reading dropped from just under 100 to 53.1.\n\n&gt; This week's drop was the second-largest one week decline in the index's history and just the 10th time that the index lost more than a third (33 points) in a single week. The most recent occurrence was back in early March in the middle of the Covid crash, and every other prior period where the index saw a similar drop, the S&amp;P 500 was also down every time by an average of 2.3%. Therefore, it's not much of a surprise to see the big drop this week given the big declines in the market. But what about going forward? Do big drops in the NAAIM Index mean a bounce back for markets or further declines?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/091120-NAAIM.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # The Most and Least Heavily Shorted Stocks in the Russell 1,000\n\n&gt; Below is an updated look at the most heavily shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000. Each of these 30 stocks has at least 15% of its equity float sold short.\n\n&gt; At the top of the list is Nordstrom (JWN) with 38.66% of its float sold short. With a YTD decline of 61.86%, the shorts have crushed it with JWN this year.\n\n&gt; With its huge portfolio of office and retail real estate, Brookfield Property REIT(BPYU) has the second highest short interest in the Russell 1,000 at 33.7%. BPYU is down 35.7% YTD.\n\n&gt; There are plenty of other well-known companies on the list of the most heavily shorted stocks. Examples include American Airlines (AAL), Virgin Galactic (SPCE), LendingTree (TREE), Wayfair (W), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), ADT, TripAdvisor (TRIP), Beyond Meat (BYND), and Kohl's (KSS).\n\n&gt; One name that is no longer on the list of most shorted stocks is Tesla (TSLA). When we provided an update on short interest back in February (a pre-COVID world), Tesla (TSLA) had more than 17% of its float sold short, but that number is all the way down to 8.3% as of the most recent filing.\n\n&gt; These 30 stocks with the highest short interest are down an average of 3.01% since last Wednesday (9/2) when the S&amp;P 500 made its last closing high. That's actually a little bit better than the 3.55% average decline for the rest of the stocks in the Russell 1,000. And year-to-date, these 30 stocks are up an average of 0.60% versus an average gain of 0.81% for the rest of the index. That's not much of a difference!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/most-heavily-shorted.png))**\n\n&gt; Below is a list of the 30 least shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000 as a percentage of equity float. None of these stocks have more than 0.71% of their float sold short, and they're mostly made up of more conservative names in the Health Care and Consumer Staples sectors.\n\n&gt; Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) has the lowest short interest as a percentage of float in the Russell 1,000 at just 0.36%. Microsoft (MSFT) -- one of the key mega-cap Tech names -- has the second lowest short interest, followed by Merck (MRK), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Medtronic (MDT).\n\n&gt; Somewhat surprisingly, Amazon (AMZN) is the sixth least shorted stock in the entire Russell 1,000. While AMZN is still thought of as a high-flying momentum name by many investors, its short interest levels tell a much different story, painting it as more of a non-cyclical stock like Pepsi (PEP), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), or Coca- Cola (KO).\n\n&gt; While the 30 most heavily shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000 are up 0.60% YTD, the 30 least shorted stocks in the index are up much more at +8%. This group has MSFT, AMZN, HD, and AAPL to thank for that strong performance!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/leastshorted.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5 Lessons Learned About Rising Rates\n\n&gt; While the direction of the 10-year Treasury yield over the last cycle was decidedly lower, as shown in LPL\u2019s Chart of the Day, there were still six extended periods where it rose at least 0.75%, and in two of those it rose almost 2%. Looking ahead, economic growth below potential, slack in the labor market, and an extremely supportive Federal Reserve (Fed) may limit rate pressure in the near term, but with interest rates already low and massive stimulus in place, we believe the overall direction is likely to be higher.\n\n&gt; \u201cEven in a falling rate period there are lessons from the last cycle about rising rates,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cAmong them: Careful when the Fed stops buying and sometimes the best defense is a good offense.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.9.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; While every economic cycle is unique, the last cycle highlighted these key takeaways about periods of rising rates:\n\n&gt; * **Careful when the Fed stops buying.**  The two drivers of rising rates last cycle were economic growth and Fed bond purchases, also known as quantitative easing (QE). The Fed buys bonds to keep rates down, but the start of Fed buying has actually been the time when rates rise\u2014likely on expectations that the purchases would help strengthen the economy. These periods also often followed large rate declines either because markets anticipated the start of Fed buying or the economy was faltering. The takeaway: unless the economy is really taking off, any rising-rate period may pause for an extended period, or even reverse, when the Fed backs off bond purchases.\n&gt; * **Sometime the best defense is a good offense.** Lower-quality, more economically sensitive bond sectors actually performed well during periods of rising rates during the last cycle. Rate gains were largely driven by economic improvement rather than a large pick-up in inflation, and that\u2019s typically a good environment for sectors like high-yield bonds and bank loans. The downside is that these are much riskier bond sectors and don\u2019t provide the potential diversification benefits of higher-quality bonds during periods of stock declines.\n&gt; * **Don\u2019t expect TIPS to provide much resilience because of their inflation adjustment.** Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are high-quality bonds that have provided a little extra insulation against rising rates compared to similarly dated Treasuries when inflation expectations increased. TIPS prices are adjusted for inflation, but even with the adjustment, they are still very sensitive to rates.\n&gt; * **Investment-grade corporates can both hurt and help.** If credit spreads narrow when rates are rising, investment-grade corporates can post some solid gains in a rising-rate environment, but if spreads are holding steady or even widening, they can be very sensitive to changes in Treasury yields, potentially (although not often) even more sensitive than Treasuries.\n&gt; * **Mortgage-backed securities (MBS)** have not provided as much insulation as corporates, but they also have had less downside. While MBS have certainly outperformed Treasuries during periods of rising rates, they have not performed as well as investment-grade corporates. But they also have come with less downside, losing only 1.4% in their worst performing period compared to a 4% loss during the worst period for corporates.\nWith the Fed still providing strong stimulus and economic growth potentially poised to accelerate, we currently see an increased risk of rates moving higher. We are playing some offense with our equity exposure, which allows us to emphasize a focus on higher-quality bonds. Among bond sectors, we are emphasizing MBS and still prefer investment-grade corporates over Treasuries. History may not repeat, but if it rhymes, this positioning may help add resilience to a fixed income portfolio if rates extend their move off recent lows.\n\n&gt; With the Fed still providing strong stimulus and economic growth potentially poised to accelerate, we currently see an increased risk of rates moving higher.

Below we take a look at the best and worst performing stocks in the Russell 1,000 since the 9/2 high for the S&amp;P. For each stock, we also include its YTD total return and its percentage change from the 3/23 COVID Crash low through 9/2.\n\n&gt; Capri Holdings (CPRI) is up more than any other stock in the Russell 1,000 since 9/2 with a gain of 17.43%. Even after the recent gains, however, Capri -- the holding company for brands like Michael Kors, Jimmy Choo, and Versace -- is still down 52.9% year-to-date.\n\n&gt; Only four other stocks are up more than 10% since 9/2 -- Beyond Meat (BYND), PVH, Virtu Financial (VIRT), and Reinsurance Group (RGA). Interestingly, BYND and VIRT are also up big (~80%) year-to-date, while PVH and RGA are both down more than 35% year-to-date.\n\n&gt; What stands out the most about the list of winners is that only one Technology stock made the cut -- Sabre (SABR). Most names come from the two consumer sectors including cruise-liners like Carnival (CCL), Royal Caribbean (RCL) and Norwegian Cruise (NCLH), Kohl's (KSS), Williams-Sonoma (WSM), Six Flags (SIX), Foot Locker (FL), and Ralph Lauren (RL). Both UBER and LYFT also made the cut with gains of 6% since 9/2. The 30 biggest winners since 9/2 are still down an average of 20% year-to-date, while the rest of the stocks in the Russell 1,000 are up an average of 1.46% YTD.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/bestsince92.png))**\n\n&gt; While only one Technology stock made the list of biggest winners since 9/2, the sector accounts for two-thirds of the 30 biggest losers over the same time frame. As shown below, since 9/2, the six worst performing stocks in the Russell 1,000 and ten of the worst twelve all come from Tech. Notably, though, these 30 stocks that have all fallen more than 12% since 9/2 are still up an average of 5.6% YTD. Were it not for the horrid YTD performance of the Energy stocks that made the list, the average YTD gain would be even higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/worstsince92.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Typical Early September Weakness Recovers Mid-Month Sells Off Month-End\n\n&gt; As of yesterday\u2019s close the market was down more than the historical average performance in September. DJIA was down nearly -3.3%, S&amp;P 500 was down -4.8%, NASDAQ was off 7.9%, Russell 1000 was down -5.2% and Russell 2000 lost 3.7%. Today\u2019s rally looks like the beginning of a textbook mid-month recovery rally However, the second half of September has historically been weaker than the first half. The week after options expiration week can be treacherous with S&amp;P 500 logging 23 weekly losses in 30 years since 1990. End-of-quarter portfolio restructuring, and window dressing can amplify the impacts of any negative headlines.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/75a927aee973e2c31a0d76ff0be15d59/fa78a7e1d90fbdef-fe/s500x750/8f217c04559740d2db6c24b7ea855ecd579ec195.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending September 11th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKS55-50q60))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 9.13.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 9.14.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 9.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1LCuH7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  9.15.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/IU3xGVJ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 9.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EOC9Qwy.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 9.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/faX2lNR.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 9.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 9.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/CdwssKa.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 9.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 9.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 9.18.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket.",

        "selftext": "After cashing in on MU calls this morning, like the rest of us, I immediately noticed a sharp drop in tech stocks, which made me reconsider the future of the VIX, which has trended up more than 20% since Aug 18, even as the SPY continues to reach new highs.\n\nOur friend [Mohamed El-Erian](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-pros-are-getting-ready-for-a-market-crash-retail-investors-not-so-much-top-economist-warns-11598970447) credits the the decoupling of the of the VIX from the SPY largely on due to retail investors continuing to chase the parabolic climb in tech stocks with as many calls as they can, assuming the ride will never end. The last time this happened (think Sept '19 - Feb '20), the VIX eventually hit a new ATH and SPY fell 32%. I don't see this happening again at all, at least in the short term, especially if the recession turns into a depression and a longer term low forms below the bottom reached on March 23, 2020. \n\nWhile premiums are high on VXX and UVXY, they should imply that the market is anticipating an increase in volatilty leading up to the election, or for reasons yet to be understood. In my opinion, the SPY is being bought up even more intraday to counter the affects of rising volatility. Keep in mind that the increase in volatility is occuring alongside the continuous actions of the Fed. The last thing we should do is fight the Fed, but how long can this massive disconnect from reality continue?",
