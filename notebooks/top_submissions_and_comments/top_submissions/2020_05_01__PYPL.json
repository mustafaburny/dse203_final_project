        "selftext": "Warren Buffett made headlines recently after his recent [virtual Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69rm13iUUgE).\n\nBuffett sold of all his shares in the major US airlines, and Berkshire announced a record quarterly net loss of nearly $50BN. Berkshire *had* held sizeable positions (around 10%) in the major US airlines.\n\nAs well as this, Buffett also allowed Berkshire's cash stake to rise to a record $137.3BN from $128BN at the end of 2019.\n\nClearly, as he is selling at a significant loss, Buffett believes that there is further pain ahead for the airlines. \n\nThe GOAT is not one to fall for the sunk cost fallacy...\n\nMoreover, his cash position indicates that he doesn't believe that we have reached the stock market bottom yet, although he wouldn't give specifics.\n\nOthers however are more explicitly bearish.\n\nThe numbers are certainly [not looking good](https://fortune.com/2020/03/20/recession-us-gdp-negative-growth-q2-predictions/)...\n\n**TRUTH 1/2:**\n\n[1640 CEOs left their posts in 2019](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/07/2019-had-the-most-ceo-departures-on-record-with-more-than-1600.html), the highest year on record since tracking began in 2002.\n\nFor context, there were 1484 exits in *2008* when the country was embroiled in the financial crisis.\n\nThis trend has continued in 2020, [in January a record 219 CEOs left their posts](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/12/rapid-ceo-turnover-continues-with-a-record-number-of-top-executives-departing-in-january.html), the highest month on record.\n\nThe economy was going to crash anyway. It was inevitable.\n\nHowever, they were afraid of massive protests against corporate greed, massive social unrest, etc so they needed a diversion that would provide an excuse.\n\nPeople will think the crash was solely due to the virus and not the numerous fundamental economic and structural issues at play.\n\nTo highlight just a few: we've had the [yield curve inversion](https://www.businessinsider.de/international/yield-curve-inversion-explained-what-it-is-what-it-means-2019-8/?r=US&amp;IR=T), the [repo madness](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-08/repo-blowup-was-fueled-by-big-banks-and-hedge-funds-bis-says), the [record corporate debt](https://www.businessinsider.de/international/us-corporate-debt-10-trillion-record-percentage-economy-expert-warnings-2019-12/?r=US&amp;IR=T), and [corporations being the main source of demand for equities via stock buybacks](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/business/stock-market-buybacks.html) which enrich executives that hit certain earnings per share targets.\n\nLast year billionaire Peter Thiel, who was part of the notorious Paypal Mafia, [spoke on the dangers of American Exceptionalism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JRyy2MM-rI). He argues that this has made America \"exceptionally un-self-critical\"\n\nWarren Buffett concluded in his virtual meeting: \"Never bet against America\"\n\nIn other words, never bet against the military industrial complex to enforce American superiority and the power of the dollar as the de facto unit of exchange globally.\n\n**TRUTH 2/2:**\n\nAs smart contracts pioneer Nick Szabo has stated:\n\n\"Buffett's wealth can be measured less in present cash than in the future cash from the Fed he is right up there at the front of the Cantillon line to get.\"\n\n[The Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs) essentially refers to the fact that fiat printing itself increases inequality. \n\nOn a more general note, it is important to remember that, despite his gentle image, Buffett is ruthless in his craft. \n\nA [New York magazine profile from 1991](https://books.google.de/books?id=veTPZA9TWxsC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=1991+new+york+magazine+warren+buffett+Warren+looks+like+a+teddy+bear,+but+mentally+is+he+ever+tough&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OT8xAOp_-y&amp;sig=ACfU3U2s1_9PvAvkaw4w5BSh0l1KgG1yhA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjtvP2__ZzpAhUG3aQKHfcYA1kQ6AEwFXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=1991%20new%20york%20magazine%20warren%20buffett%20Warren%20looks%20like%20a%20teddy%20bear%2C%20but%20mentally%20is%20he%20ever%20tough&amp;f=false) stated: \n\n\"Though he appears homey and guileless and cultivates a hayseed image, Buffett can be iron-fisted.\"\n\nAccording to a senior Salomon trader: \"Warren looks like a teddy bear, but mentally is he ever tough.\"\n\nYes, Buffett has dropped numerous gems throughout the years, but ultimately his responsibility is to Berkshire Hathaway and his own, sizeable, bags.\n\nOverall, it would be foolish to overlook Buffett's current cash position.\n\nWhen everything is dirt cheap and we do eventually hit the bottom, he will be flush with cash and ready to aggressively sweep up bargains. \n\nAt the moment, it is clear that he believes these bargains are not present, and therefore it would be wise to consider the fact that we may have further downside in store...\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsAfJMNtxsU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsAfJMNtxsU)",

        "selftext": "Trading options during earnings season definitely adds to the intensity level, but makes it very interesting and rewarding. Yesterday I bought a 120 TWLO 5/22 p @5.30. I also bought a 135 TWLO c @ 6.10. Now, I have been buying calls in TWLO from 90 and up in the past month. I thought the recent run up provided for a difficult earnings season. However, I bought the call around 12:30pm because I didn\u2019t want to miss a potential pop. Got lucky. In retrospect I shouldn\u2019t have even bought the Put, but a little protection is fine if it fell hard. I sold the C this morning for a $2800 profit. The news was so good on TWLO, that I also bought an OTM, at the time, 165 C later on the day. Up another $1200 unrealized. \n\nI had 8 UBER calls. My strategy was to sell all if UBER traded above 30 in the AM which I did. After I had time to digest LYFTs report, I bought 4 ITM 28 UBER back. Still holding. \n\nROKU was another great holding of mine. However, I sold all three deep ITMs before the close because I was up over 6k from them. I did buy one OTM 145 C. Gone. \n\nI\u2019m a huge believer in SQ so I picked up 5 ITMs today. Granted, I sold all 10 ITM calls yesterday before earnings. I held 3 ITM PYPLs. I thought Square May have bad earnings based on the pre earnings trade and PYPL would be good. The markets could easily sell a stock no matter how good the earnings, INTC. AMZN, AMD for example but I held my PYPLs. \n\nAlso, during the day I kept buying and adding to my SBUX ITM C positions and bought more CRM options on the strength of TWLOs report. I\u2019m also holding several other positions. Very good day overall!! \n\nI\u2019m looking to create a good group discussion to bounce trade ideas and strategies. I welcome other successful trade stories! I\u2019m happy to help others also. As I said numerous times, I am a strong confident directional trader. Most of all, be patient, learn from your mistakes, take calculated risks and stay mentally strong. Good luck!!",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 4th, 2020.\n\n# **April\u2019s jobs report showing millions out of work looms large in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/01/aprils-jobs-report-showing-millions-out-of-work-looms-large-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Investors will focus on the slow reopening of the economy in the coming week, as Friday\u2019s dismal April employment report is expect to paint a frightening picture of the most rapid job losses in history.\n*****\n&gt; The unemployment rate is expected to jump from 4.4% to over 16.1% in April, the highest level since 1939, according to Dow Jones. Job losses are estimated to total 22 million, slightly below the entire number of jobs that were recovered since the Great Recession.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said the market will likely be able to look past the terrible jobs number as it has done with most bad data, showing the results of a sudden and unprecedented shutdown of the economy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think people are too gloomy about the unemployment situation. I think they think the unemployment rate is going to rise through the summer,\u201d said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont. \u201cI think the unemployment rate probably peaks in May.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Earnings season continues with dozens more companies reporting first-quarter results and talking about the impact of the virus and shutdowns on their businesses. So far, earnings appear to be down 12.7% in the first quarter, based on actual reports and estimates, according to Refinitiv. A diverse group of companies report, including Walt Disney, General Motors, CVS Health and Bristol-Myers Squibb.\n*****\n&gt; But investors are watching the restarting of the economy, now underway at some level in many states. \u201cIf they go well that\u2019s a good thing, but if in a week or two, you start to see some bad virus numbers, that\u2019ll be a blow to confidence,\u201d said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo.\n*****\n&gt; # Best April in years\nStocks started May with a sharp decline Friday, after a 12.7% gain in the S&amp;P 500 in April, its best month since 1987.\n*****\n&gt; Sam Stovall, CFRA chief investment strategist, said the market had been looking forward to the latest extension of fiscal stimulus, approved by Congress, and comments from the Fed, which reaffirmed after its meeting Wednesday that it will do whatever is needed to help the economy. \u201cNow there\u2019s not that much to look forward to,\u201d he said, adding the market would react negatively to any resurgence in the coronavirus outbreak.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe had a very nice April, the best April since 1938. May is sort of a ho-hum month,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cIt\u2019s in the bottom half in terms of average price change, slightly below average in terms of frequency of an advance. \u2026 Just looking at last year, May tends to digest April\u2019s gains.\u201d The S&amp;P 500\u2032s April gain was its best for the month in 82 years.\n*****\n&gt; # Virus economy\nEconomists and market strategists have been tracking the progress of the virus state by state, watching hospitalization rates, new cases and recoveries for clues on how quickly the economy might be able to restart. The economy is expected to have plunged into a deep recession in the second quarter, contracting by 35% or more, after a 4.8% decline in the first quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Stanley said he expects the unemployment rate to be a better-than-consensus 11.6% in April before it rises again in May. \u201cThis is all a stab in the dark,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s not going to come down as quickly as it went up,\u201d said Stanley. \u201cBut I do think you\u2019re going to see steady improvement. I think you\u2019re going to see millions of people brought back into the payrolls for several months in succession. I think we can get out of the double digits [unemployment] by the end of the summer.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Some workers are expected to return to their company payrolls as a result of the small business-focused Paycheck Protection Program, which encourages companies to keep workers on their payroll and bring back those who were cut. But that may not show up until May or June as a factor in the jobs data, Stanley said.\n*****\n&gt; Millions more are expected to have filed for unemployment claims in the week ending May 2, on top of the 30 million who filed in the previous six weeks. Economists say with such big unprecedented numbers, it is difficult to predict the unemployment rate since some people may have been temporarily unemployed and expect to return to work.\n*****\n&gt; But regardless, the number could be a shocker even though the market has shrugged off the big numbers of jobless claims and focused instead on the virus curve flattening.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it could spook people,\u201d said Schumacher. \u201cIn the markets, we\u2019ve been watching the weekly claims, but everybody knows what unemployment is.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stanley said he is also watching Tuesday\u2019s ISM nonmanufacturing data, a look at the services sector during April. A cross section of March data shows it was the services sector that took the biggest hit in the shutdowns, and it\u2019s unclear how quickly it can recover.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere are people who will go and do things as soon as they\u2019re allowed to, and there are people who are going to stay home for a month or two longer,\u201d he said. \u201cI do think expecting we\u2019re going to pack 100,000 people into a football stadium in September is way too optimistic.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stanley said some of the steep drop in consumer spending in March was the result of consumers stopping spending on health care, including elective surgery. That actually is an area that can bounce back quickly once the health care system is up and running for non virus related treatments.\n*****\n&gt; # A new 20-year bond\nThe Treasury could announce its new 20-year bond on Wednesday, when it discloses its quarterly refunding requirements, Schumacher said. He expects about $21 billion of the new 20-year to be issued in the second quarter.\n*****\n&gt; The amount of Treasury debt is expected to grow in the second quarter to help fund the growing deficit, made bigger by the trillions the government is spending to combat the virus.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe supply announcement we think is significant because you\u2019re going to see large auction increases, not just for one month but set in motion for many months to come,\u201d said Schumacher. He expects Treasury to announce $330 billion in notes and bonds in the refunding for the second quarter, up from $240 billion in the first quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury bill issuance is expected at $1.9 trillion in the second quarter but Schumacher expects that to fall to $260 billion in the third quarter. The bills were used to give the Treasury cash to pay for emergency programs and more of that debt will move to long term debt.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/lucZqhO.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ScMf5ki.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/lTrieA0.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/a6RSgrj.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9mfZglW.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Rkt7Uup.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8Ru9JJy.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1L1YEEG.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DwM4sys.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OxcbRYQ.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/zvZWYtm.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/93bme56.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/b57XIzN.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# US Manufacturing Sector Has Entered a Deep Recession\n\n&gt; It is a foregone conclusion that the US economy has entered recession, led by the consumer, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the US economy based on gross domestic product (GDP). The collapse of consumer spending was evident in March personal consumption expenditures data released on Wednesday that showed a record 7.5% month-over-month drop in consumer outlays. It would have been worse if we weren\u2019t stocking our refrigerators and pantries.\n\n&gt; The manufacturing sector is also contracting sharply, not surprisingly given the business shutdowns that began in March. Investors had a glimpse of the extent of the hit to manufacturing in the business investment component of first quarter GDP, which revealed a sharp 8.6% annualized decline, durable goods orders for March, which fell 14.4%, and Markit\u2019s preliminary Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) for manufacturing in April that came in at 36.9, a level consistent with a severe recession.\n\n&gt; Today\u2019s Institute for Supply Management (ISM) PMI for manufacturing\u2014the so-called official PMI\u2014provided more evidence of the depth of the manufacturing downturn. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the headline index fell 7.6 points to 41.5, better than Bloomberg\u2019s consensus forecast of 36, but a level consistent with prior recessions.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ISM-Chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; But that\u2019s the good news. Peeling back the onion in this report reveals that the headline number was inflated by the supplier deliveries component. Normally, lengthening supplier delivery times reflect strong demand, which prevents suppliers from keeping up. However, in this environment, it reflects supply chain disruptions from lockdowns around the world related to COVID-19.\n\n&gt; The new orders and employment components of the report, which both fell more than 15 points to around 27, are better indicators of where manufacturing activity in the US is right now. The new orders number just missed the December 2008 level of 25.9, while the employment component hit its lowest level since 1949, putting the slump into proper perspective.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe more forward-looking components of the ISM report clearly indicate the manufacturing sector is in the midst of one of the sharpest contractions ever,\u201d said LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. \u201cGiven the close relationship between manufacturing activity and corporate profits, the 25% cut to S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates for 2020 that we\u2019ve seen since March 1 is probably not enough.\u201d\n\n&gt; The ISM report points to a sharp upcoming drop in capital investment and a huge hit to earnings in the second quarter\u2014potentially down 40% year over year (FactSet consensus is calling for a 38% year-over-year decline in S&amp;P 500 earnings).\n\n&gt; Looking ahead, while the economic impact of the global lockdowns has been severe, we continue to be reassured by developing plans to reopen the economy, progress toward treatments and vaccines, and the resolve of Americans to get through this. We continue to expect a very strong rebound in manufacturing and the broad economy later this year.\n\n*****\n\n# Global Central Banks All In\n\n&gt; The Federal Reserve (Fed), the European Central Bank (ECB), and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) all met in the last week and while the show of power was minimal compared to recent weeks, they collectively reasserted their resolve to do whatever is necessary to support the global economy through the COVID-19 economic crisis. Rates are being held about as low as they can go, significant new programs to enhance market liquidity and support lending are in place, and, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, asset purchases have accelerated. In fact, with April not yet completed, central bank assets have risen over $3 trillion, the biggest two-month jump on record.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe central bank response to COVID-19 has been fast, effective, and built to impress,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAnd the market is seeing it. It\u2019s no coincidence that the market bottomed the day after the Fed rolled out a wide range of new programs addressing key areas of market and economic disruption.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Blog-Chart-20-04-30.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Overview of Recent Central Bank Activity\n\n&gt; The Fed concluded its most recent two-day meeting on Wednesday, April 29. Prior to the meeting the Fed had expanded its program supporting municipalities by lowering the minimum size of the city or county to qualify. The Fed left its target rate unchanged at 0 \u2013 0.25%. Through its policy statement and Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s comments, the Fed signaled that it is unlikely to remove its extraordinary policy support anytime soon, and we believe the Fed may hold its policy rate near zero into 2022. Asset purchases are currently open-ended and have expanded to include investment-grade and high-yield corporate exchange-traded funds.\n\n&gt; The BOJ met on Monday, April 27 and announced that it would lift its cap on buying government bonds, making purchases open ended, and triple the size of its corporate bond commercial debt purchases.\n\n&gt; The ECB met on Thursday, April 30 and announced new refinancing operations and that it would ease conditions on long-term loans to banks, encouraging banks to increase lending.\n\n&gt; With interest rates near zero, all major central banks have been expanding their economic support through new programs and increased asset purchases. Central bank are showing that in a time of crisis, their policy response is not limited to setting policy rates or even bond purchases. The expanded activity has all but eliminated the idea that the central banks are out of ammunition, both now and looking forward. There will come a time when these programs will end, balance sheets will unwind, and rates will rise. But until that time, central banks have shown that even prudent support in a time of economic distress is only limited by their imagination, keeping the old investing maxim \u201cDon\u2019t fight the Fed\u201d alive even in an age of zero rates.\n\n*****\n\n# Typical May Trading: A Month of Transition with Negative Predisposition\n\n&gt; Once again it is that time of the year where we increasingly see and hear \u201cSell in May.\u201d But when exactly in May is the \u201cbest\u201d time to sell? Based upon the last 21 years of data, the best time could be early in May. The month has opened well, on average, recently with strength on the first trading day and on the second trading day for the most part. Afterwards, DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 all tend to drift sideways to lower until around May\u2019s sixteenth trading day or so. It is on this day the NASDAQ and Russell 2000 begin to rally to finish the month. Beware though, this late-May rally typically fizzles before it can exceed the highs reached earlier in the month.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1df0a9e6bf9c57baf44e6917725a0b23/49574a3950141284-4d/s500x750/4f224d3ee89c6ef6d69c08facbac61a77da3fd3b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# This is Still an Election Year\n\n&gt; We have all been rather preoccupied with the coronavirus pandemic, market volatility and our individual situation. Meanwhile there is still a U.S. Presidential Election taking place this year. And folks are beginning to wonder what the next political alignment might be and the ramifications that alignment has had on the market historically.\n\n&gt; Six possible political alignments exist in Washington: Republican President with a Republican congress, Democratic congress or split Congress; and a Democratic President with a Democratic Congress, Republican Congress or split Congress. Data presented in the chart below begin in 1949 with the first full presidential term following WWII.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dce5f19dd2ccfc16a4e0795dd5a11f68/8033867962439c40-45/s500x750/8543ffd66d568035ffa681a3d72b861c8f84b996.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Election years are traditionally up years. Incumbent administrations shamelessly attempt to massage the economy so voters will keep them in power. But sometimes overpowering events occur and the market crumbles, usually resulting in a change of political control.\n\n&gt; Republicans won in 1920 (DJIA -32.9%) as the post-war economy contracted and President Wilson ailed. The Democrats came back during the 1932 (-23.1%) Depression when the Dow hit its lowest level of the 20th century. A world at war and the fall of France jolted the market in 1940 (-12.7%), but Roosevelt won an unprecedented third term. Cold War confrontations and Truman\u2019s historic upset of Dewey held markets down through the end of 1948 (-2.1%). Recently the Great Recession and bear market of 2008 (-33.8%) helped put Obama and the Democrats back in the White House.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fe57b47990e4b1b913e16595818a4df4/8033867962439c40-ea/s500x750/b5004568a1ca04f9004d23bd405de22f277408f2.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# 10-Day Advance/Decline Lines Running Hot\n\n&gt; The gains in the first half of the week lifted every sector but two\u2014Utilities and Financials\u2014above their 50-DMAs. Meanwhile, Health Care had even touched overbought territory (over 1 standard deviation above its 50-day) earlier in the week, making it the first sector to be overbought since late February.\n\n&gt; When it comes to another measure we monitor, the 10-day advance/decline line, conditions are more broadly appearing overbought. The 10-day advance/decline line measures the average number of daily advancers minus decliners in an index or sector over the last 10 trading days. Very high readings suggest that things have gotten extended in the very near term and downside mean reversion can be expected. Very low reading suggest the opposite.\n\n&gt; The 10-day A/D lines for sectors have been pretty strong recently indicating broad participation in the rally, but this has led these readings to become elevated indicating conditions may be running a bit too hot in the near term. Outside of the defensive sectors like Consumer Staples, Utilities, and Real Estate, every sector's 10-day A/D line has been in overbought territory at some point over the past week. The same can also be said for the 10-day A/D line for the S&amp;P 500. We'd note, though, that while A/D lines are extended, they're not at extreme levels seen at other points over the past year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/10day.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending May 1st, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWpVmNiVbw4))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 5.3.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

        "selftext": " Ok, hear me out.\n\nI made a stupid move and went with ZNGA instead of TWLO or Fastly or Paypal because I am an idiot and didn't think cloud CDN's would do as well as they have. Looking for revenge.\n\nI am pretty sure that I will FOMO into Cloudflare tomorrow but figured I would post up the DD I have done. Over 15 minutes was spent on this, top level DD.\n\n\\*\\*Pro's:\\*\\* Well regarded in the enterprise CDN space. Lots of loyal customers, good roster including large enterprise, government, foreign stuff, Trump's Campaign website, etc.\n\n\\*\\*Con's:\\*\\* Stock ran-up already, and I think we are going to see significant upward movement tomorrow AM due to TWLO and FSLY gains overnight. I think that Shopify is now using Fastly, but there is a lot of old case studies for Cloudflare and Shopify and I have no idea when that happened.\n\n**Last quarter (Feb 20, 2020), Fastly**, who jumped like 25% AH today, beat their earnings but only offered OK-ish guidance, and they transitioned in a new CEO and their stock dropped -9%. It did not recover before the crash in march. (https://seeking alpha.com/news/3544264-fastlyminus-9-after-beats-ceo-transition)\n\nAnd the fact that they beat Q1 2020 estimates, even after the estimates were revised is a good sign. But I think their gain is larger than we will see with CloudFlare because it is going to run-up now.\n\n**Cloudflare** beat it's last earnings estimates and saw a significant jump after earnings, and continued upward movement for several days. (https://news.alpha street.com/cloudfare-net-q4-2019-earnings-snapshot/)\n\n\\--\n\nSeeing Alpha reported today;\n\n(**FASTLY**) Over the last 3 months, EPS estimates have seen 2 upward revisions and 6 downward. Revenue estimates have seen 5 upward revisions and 3 downward. (https://seekin galpha.com/symbol/fsly/earnings/revisions)\n\n(**CloudFlare**) \"Over the last 3 months, EPS estimates have seen 1 upward revision and 6 downward. Revenue estimates have seen 9 upward revisions and 1 downward.\" (https://seeking   \n alpha.com/symbol/net/earnings/revisions)\n\nSo pretty similar estimations for both, and looking at Twilio and Fastly beating so handedly, I am hoping the same can be said for CloudFlare tomorrow. As stated above, it already ran-up so the gains are much smaller if you buy same day - but that is usually the case. I think I made some good tendies off PTON and I bought EOD today. Did the same with FB\n\n\\--\n\nTL;DR - Buy Cloudflare in the morning because it is going to run up after Fastly and Twilio move 25% after beating earnings.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not autistic and probably retarded.

        "selftext": "Hey All,\n\nThis experience takes on two different parts. A bit of a background, I knew the reaction of the \"dip\" would have been similar to what we are seeing, not to the extent, but usually, people rush to \"buy the dip\", I entered too late though, two weeks ago. \n\nNow two things to consider in my case, I have been trying to make a quick buck (10% or so) on my money, short term though as I expect a bigger crash (my opinion no need to fight me on it, just a guess, you might be smarter than me and have it all figured, good for you :) ). One thing to consider and what I learnt through my years of trading. \n\nIts a gamble for the short term, if you are putting your money in for a short term, in this current market, its similar to forex in terms of volatility, it will jump up and down, and the trickiest part is to time the right exact moment to get that increase, you can get lucky. Your best luck is to enter at around 3:50 PM, aftermarket usually positive and pre-market is usually positive these days, sell at 9:40 am and you will make a decent buck. \n\nNow, is it worth it making this gamble? well if you put into strong stocks that have a low chance of bankrupting and considered still cheap, if you mess up and you ride a crash, depending on how bad it is, you have a chance of getting your capital back in 2 years or so. \n\nNow what have I done? I entered a stock and it preformed well previously but took a hit, (hint its an oil company) , I bought them and it rode up for a couple of days then hit down crashing, I sold today at $80 loss (if I sold right now vs 9:30 am I would've been at $500).\n\nThe other elephant in the room. You will not feel well mentally, it will add a shit load of stress for short term (unless you crap money, then good for you).  Once I saw the crash, I had an appetite loss the entire day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo short term, not worth it (gambling)\n\n Midterm, very risky, there are some indications referring to another dip based on historical data, how accurate is this? No idea at all and no one knows (otherwise we all would be rich and don't argue this lol)\n\nLong term, entering right now might get you a sweet % but which companies take a larger amount of your portfolio? \n\nPS : Some stocks are almost at an all-time high, Paypal, Amazon, tesla, Shopify, I wouldn't touch them right now unless they see a 50% dip, how likely is that'? Not very likely at all, I would be dreaming lol.\n\nStocks is a side hustle with risks, It is not going to get you rich overnight, and whatever money you throw in here, consider it gone. Why do I say that? If you detach yourself emotionally from that hard made money, you will make smarter decisions than FOMO. If you make a wrong decision, you're not falling into depression.",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 4th, 2020.\n\n# **April\u2019s jobs report showing millions out of work looms large in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/01/aprils-jobs-report-showing-millions-out-of-work-looms-large-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Investors will focus on the slow reopening of the economy in the coming week, as Friday\u2019s dismal April employment report is expect to paint a frightening picture of the most rapid job losses in history.\n*****\n&gt; The unemployment rate is expected to jump from 4.4% to over 16.1% in April, the highest level since 1939, according to Dow Jones. Job losses are estimated to total 22 million, slightly below the entire number of jobs that were recovered since the Great Recession.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said the market will likely be able to look past the terrible jobs number as it has done with most bad data, showing the results of a sudden and unprecedented shutdown of the economy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think people are too gloomy about the unemployment situation. I think they think the unemployment rate is going to rise through the summer,\u201d said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont. \u201cI think the unemployment rate probably peaks in May.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Earnings season continues with dozens more companies reporting first-quarter results and talking about the impact of the virus and shutdowns on their businesses. So far, earnings appear to be down 12.7% in the first quarter, based on actual reports and estimates, according to Refinitiv. A diverse group of companies report, including Walt Disney, General Motors, CVS Health and Bristol-Myers Squibb.\n*****\n&gt; But investors are watching the restarting of the economy, now underway at some level in many states. \u201cIf they go well that\u2019s a good thing, but if in a week or two, you start to see some bad virus numbers, that\u2019ll be a blow to confidence,\u201d said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo.\n*****\n&gt; # Best April in years\nStocks started May with a sharp decline Friday, after a 12.7% gain in the S&amp;P 500 in April, its best month since 1987.\n*****\n&gt; Sam Stovall, CFRA chief investment strategist, said the market had been looking forward to the latest extension of fiscal stimulus, approved by Congress, and comments from the Fed, which reaffirmed after its meeting Wednesday that it will do whatever is needed to help the economy. \u201cNow there\u2019s not that much to look forward to,\u201d he said, adding the market would react negatively to any resurgence in the coronavirus outbreak.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe had a very nice April, the best April since 1938. May is sort of a ho-hum month,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cIt\u2019s in the bottom half in terms of average price change, slightly below average in terms of frequency of an advance. \u2026 Just looking at last year, May tends to digest April\u2019s gains.\u201d The S&amp;P 500\u2032s April gain was its best for the month in 82 years.\n*****\n&gt; # Virus economy\nEconomists and market strategists have been tracking the progress of the virus state by state, watching hospitalization rates, new cases and recoveries for clues on how quickly the economy might be able to restart. The economy is expected to have plunged into a deep recession in the second quarter, contracting by 35% or more, after a 4.8% decline in the first quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Stanley said he expects the unemployment rate to be a better-than-consensus 11.6% in April before it rises again in May. \u201cThis is all a stab in the dark,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s not going to come down as quickly as it went up,\u201d said Stanley. \u201cBut I do think you\u2019re going to see steady improvement. I think you\u2019re going to see millions of people brought back into the payrolls for several months in succession. I think we can get out of the double digits [unemployment] by the end of the summer.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Some workers are expected to return to their company payrolls as a result of the small business-focused Paycheck Protection Program, which encourages companies to keep workers on their payroll and bring back those who were cut. But that may not show up until May or June as a factor in the jobs data, Stanley said.\n*****\n&gt; Millions more are expected to have filed for unemployment claims in the week ending May 2, on top of the 30 million who filed in the previous six weeks. Economists say with such big unprecedented numbers, it is difficult to predict the unemployment rate since some people may have been temporarily unemployed and expect to return to work.\n*****\n&gt; But regardless, the number could be a shocker even though the market has shrugged off the big numbers of jobless claims and focused instead on the virus curve flattening.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it could spook people,\u201d said Schumacher. \u201cIn the markets, we\u2019ve been watching the weekly claims, but everybody knows what unemployment is.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stanley said he is also watching Tuesday\u2019s ISM nonmanufacturing data, a look at the services sector during April. A cross section of March data shows it was the services sector that took the biggest hit in the shutdowns, and it\u2019s unclear how quickly it can recover.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere are people who will go and do things as soon as they\u2019re allowed to, and there are people who are going to stay home for a month or two longer,\u201d he said. \u201cI do think expecting we\u2019re going to pack 100,000 people into a football stadium in September is way too optimistic.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stanley said some of the steep drop in consumer spending in March was the result of consumers stopping spending on health care, including elective surgery. That actually is an area that can bounce back quickly once the health care system is up and running for non virus related treatments.\n*****\n&gt; # A new 20-year bond\nThe Treasury could announce its new 20-year bond on Wednesday, when it discloses its quarterly refunding requirements, Schumacher said. He expects about $21 billion of the new 20-year to be issued in the second quarter.\n*****\n&gt; The amount of Treasury debt is expected to grow in the second quarter to help fund the growing deficit, made bigger by the trillions the government is spending to combat the virus.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe supply announcement we think is significant because you\u2019re going to see large auction increases, not just for one month but set in motion for many months to come,\u201d said Schumacher. He expects Treasury to announce $330 billion in notes and bonds in the refunding for the second quarter, up from $240 billion in the first quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury bill issuance is expected at $1.9 trillion in the second quarter but Schumacher expects that to fall to $260 billion in the third quarter. The bills were used to give the Treasury cash to pay for emergency programs and more of that debt will move to long term debt.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/lucZqhO.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ScMf5ki.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/lTrieA0.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/a6RSgrj.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9mfZglW.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Rkt7Uup.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8Ru9JJy.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1L1YEEG.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DwM4sys.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OxcbRYQ.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/zvZWYtm.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/93bme56.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/b57XIzN.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# US Manufacturing Sector Has Entered a Deep Recession\n\n&gt; It is a foregone conclusion that the US economy has entered recession, led by the consumer, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the US economy based on gross domestic product (GDP). The collapse of consumer spending was evident in March personal consumption expenditures data released on Wednesday that showed a record 7.5% month-over-month drop in consumer outlays. It would have been worse if we weren\u2019t stocking our refrigerators and pantries.\n\n&gt; The manufacturing sector is also contracting sharply, not surprisingly given the business shutdowns that began in March. Investors had a glimpse of the extent of the hit to manufacturing in the business investment component of first quarter GDP, which revealed a sharp 8.6% annualized decline, durable goods orders for March, which fell 14.4%, and Markit\u2019s preliminary Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) for manufacturing in April that came in at 36.9, a level consistent with a severe recession.\n\n&gt; Today\u2019s Institute for Supply Management (ISM) PMI for manufacturing\u2014the so-called official PMI\u2014provided more evidence of the depth of the manufacturing downturn. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the headline index fell 7.6 points to 41.5, better than Bloomberg\u2019s consensus forecast of 36, but a level consistent with prior recessions.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ISM-Chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; But that\u2019s the good news. Peeling back the onion in this report reveals that the headline number was inflated by the supplier deliveries component. Normally, lengthening supplier delivery times reflect strong demand, which prevents suppliers from keeping up. However, in this environment, it reflects supply chain disruptions from lockdowns around the world related to COVID-19.\n\n&gt; The new orders and employment components of the report, which both fell more than 15 points to around 27, are better indicators of where manufacturing activity in the US is right now. The new orders number just missed the December 2008 level of 25.9, while the employment component hit its lowest level since 1949, putting the slump into proper perspective.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe more forward-looking components of the ISM report clearly indicate the manufacturing sector is in the midst of one of the sharpest contractions ever,\u201d said LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. \u201cGiven the close relationship between manufacturing activity and corporate profits, the 25% cut to S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates for 2020 that we\u2019ve seen since March 1 is probably not enough.\u201d\n\n&gt; The ISM report points to a sharp upcoming drop in capital investment and a huge hit to earnings in the second quarter\u2014potentially down 40% year over year (FactSet consensus is calling for a 38% year-over-year decline in S&amp;P 500 earnings).\n\n&gt; Looking ahead, while the economic impact of the global lockdowns has been severe, we continue to be reassured by developing plans to reopen the economy, progress toward treatments and vaccines, and the resolve of Americans to get through this. We continue to expect a very strong rebound in manufacturing and the broad economy later this year.\n\n*****\n\n# Global Central Banks All In\n\n&gt; The Federal Reserve (Fed), the European Central Bank (ECB), and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) all met in the last week and while the show of power was minimal compared to recent weeks, they collectively reasserted their resolve to do whatever is necessary to support the global economy through the COVID-19 economic crisis. Rates are being held about as low as they can go, significant new programs to enhance market liquidity and support lending are in place, and, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, asset purchases have accelerated. In fact, with April not yet completed, central bank assets have risen over $3 trillion, the biggest two-month jump on record.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe central bank response to COVID-19 has been fast, effective, and built to impress,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAnd the market is seeing it. It\u2019s no coincidence that the market bottomed the day after the Fed rolled out a wide range of new programs addressing key areas of market and economic disruption.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Blog-Chart-20-04-30.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Overview of Recent Central Bank Activity\n\n&gt; The Fed concluded its most recent two-day meeting on Wednesday, April 29. Prior to the meeting the Fed had expanded its program supporting municipalities by lowering the minimum size of the city or county to qualify. The Fed left its target rate unchanged at 0 \u2013 0.25%. Through its policy statement and Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s comments, the Fed signaled that it is unlikely to remove its extraordinary policy support anytime soon, and we believe the Fed may hold its policy rate near zero into 2022. Asset purchases are currently open-ended and have expanded to include investment-grade and high-yield corporate exchange-traded funds.\n\n&gt; The BOJ met on Monday, April 27 and announced that it would lift its cap on buying government bonds, making purchases open ended, and triple the size of its corporate bond commercial debt purchases.\n\n&gt; The ECB met on Thursday, April 30 and announced new refinancing operations and that it would ease conditions on long-term loans to banks, encouraging banks to increase lending.\n\n&gt; With interest rates near zero, all major central banks have been expanding their economic support through new programs and increased asset purchases. Central bank are showing that in a time of crisis, their policy response is not limited to setting policy rates or even bond purchases. The expanded activity has all but eliminated the idea that the central banks are out of ammunition, both now and looking forward. There will come a time when these programs will end, balance sheets will unwind, and rates will rise. But until that time, central banks have shown that even prudent support in a time of economic distress is only limited by their imagination, keeping the old investing maxim \u201cDon\u2019t fight the Fed\u201d alive even in an age of zero rates.\n\n*****\n\n# Typical May Trading: A Month of Transition with Negative Predisposition\n\n&gt; Once again it is that time of the year where we increasingly see and hear \u201cSell in May.\u201d But when exactly in May is the \u201cbest\u201d time to sell? Based upon the last 21 years of data, the best time could be early in May. The month has opened well, on average, recently with strength on the first trading day and on the second trading day for the most part. Afterwards, DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 all tend to drift sideways to lower until around May\u2019s sixteenth trading day or so. It is on this day the NASDAQ and Russell 2000 begin to rally to finish the month. Beware though, this late-May rally typically fizzles before it can exceed the highs reached earlier in the month.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1df0a9e6bf9c57baf44e6917725a0b23/49574a3950141284-4d/s500x750/4f224d3ee89c6ef6d69c08facbac61a77da3fd3b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# This is Still an Election Year\n\n&gt; We have all been rather preoccupied with the coronavirus pandemic, market volatility and our individual situation. Meanwhile there is still a U.S. Presidential Election taking place this year. And folks are beginning to wonder what the next political alignment might be and the ramifications that alignment has had on the market historically.\n\n&gt; Six possible political alignments exist in Washington: Republican President with a Republican congress, Democratic congress or split Congress; and a Democratic President with a Democratic Congress, Republican Congress or split Congress.

Incumbent administrations shamelessly attempt to massage the economy so voters will keep them in power. But sometimes overpowering events occur and the market crumbles, usually resulting in a change of political control.\n\n&gt; Republicans won in 1920 (DJIA -32.9%) as the post-war economy contracted and President Wilson ailed. The Democrats came back during the 1932 (-23.1%) Depression when the Dow hit its lowest level of the 20th century. A world at war and the fall of France jolted the market in 1940 (-12.7%), but Roosevelt won an unprecedented third term. Cold War confrontations and Truman\u2019s historic upset of Dewey held markets down through the end of 1948 (-2.1%). Recently the Great Recession and bear market of 2008 (-33.8%) helped put Obama and the Democrats back in the White House.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fe57b47990e4b1b913e16595818a4df4/8033867962439c40-ea/s500x750/b5004568a1ca04f9004d23bd405de22f277408f2.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# 10-Day Advance/Decline Lines Running Hot\n\n&gt; The gains in the first half of the week lifted every sector but two\u2014Utilities and Financials\u2014above their 50-DMAs. Meanwhile, Health Care had even touched overbought territory (over 1 standard deviation above its 50-day) earlier in the week, making it the first sector to be overbought since late February.\n\n&gt; When it comes to another measure we monitor, the 10-day advance/decline line, conditions are more broadly appearing overbought. The 10-day advance/decline line measures the average number of daily advancers minus decliners in an index or sector over the last 10 trading days. Very high readings suggest that things have gotten extended in the very near term and downside mean reversion can be expected. Very low reading suggest the opposite.\n\n&gt; The 10-day A/D lines for sectors have been pretty strong recently indicating broad participation in the rally, but this has led these readings to become elevated indicating conditions may be running a bit too hot in the near term. Outside of the defensive sectors like Consumer Staples, Utilities, and Real Estate, every sector's 10-day A/D line has been in overbought territory at some point over the past week. The same can also be said for the 10-day A/D line for the S&amp;P 500. We'd note, though, that while A/D lines are extended, they're not at extreme levels seen at other points over the past year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/10day.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

The DJIA was +211.25 (.89%), NASDAQ +126.27 (1.41%), S&amp;P 500 +.32.77 (1.15%), the Russell +19.92 (1.58%) and the Transports +118.76 (1.5%).  The DJIA was split 16 up, 14 down with the biggest winner\u2019s BA +46, GS +37, HD +36, MCD +28 and V +27 DPs.  The only double-digit loser was UNH -26 DPs.  The strong sectors were Energy, Financials and materials and the weaker Consumer staples and healthcare.  Market internals were 2.5:1 up on the NYSE and 2.2:1 on NASDAQ.  Volume was light again.\nUnemployment numbers for April come at 8:30 tomorrow morning.  \n \n \nOur \u201copen forum\u201d on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.

The link is\nhttps://youtu.be/Y7H9RpWfLlo  Enjoy!!\n \nTonight\u2019s closing comment video\nhttps://youtu.be/gmdS65mok0Q\n \nSECTORS: Earnings played a part in today\u2019s market again.  The follow-thru from yesterday\u2019s numbers pushed PYPL +18 (14%) and LYFT +5.66 (21.7%).  Today\u2019s numbers were a mix with the hospitality booking firms the biggest losers.  BKNG was a miss and after closing $1443.91 +65 it fell as low as 1,381 -63 but bounced back to close $1,440 \u2013 only $3.91.  Trip Advisor (TRIP) was not quite so lucky.  They missed top and bottom lines and after closing $18.72 +.63 it fell to $17.35 and finished $17.86 -.86, but it is down 40% YTD.  \n \nUber reported horrendous numbers and it had closed $30.93 +3.11 on the strength of yesterdays LYFT numbers but the losses increased, and the company posted a loss of $2.9 billion vs. $1.4B expected and the stock fell to $29.50 before the CEO came on the call and spread some BS pixie dust about the last 4 weeks improving, but at the same time withdrew the guidance going forward.  He also said that UBER Eats grew, but that they lose money on every delivery.  At that point the stock turned and ran up to $34.19 before closing $32.80 + about $5 on the day.  Unbelievable.\n \nROKU reported a beat on revenues but another loss.  The stock had closed $137.50 +9.98 and guidance is for no profit in either 2020 or 2021.  The stock sold off to $123.11 and finished $123.50 -14.00 (3.73%).\n \n \nFOOD SUPPLY: was MIXED with TSN +2.62, BGS -.35, FLO +.14, CAG -.60, MDLZ +.02, KHC -.48, CALM +.84, JJSF +1.30, SAFM +5.91 and LANC -2.34.\n \n \nBIOPHARMA: was HIGHER with BIIB +7.22, ABBV -.96, REGN +6.55, ISRG +24.09, GILD +.38, MYL +.54, TEVA +1.06 (10.11%), VRTX +.94, BHC -1.27, INCY +.39, ICPT -3.34, LABU +.24 and IBB $127.17 +.17 (.13%).\n \nCANNABIS: This group was HIGHER with TLRY +.28, CGC +.16, CRON +.13, GWPH -.02, ACB +.003, PYX +.15, NBEV +.07, CURLF +.11, KERN +.28 and MJ $11.82 +.05 (.42%).\n\n \nDEFENSE: was HIGHER with LMT -.58, GD +5.79, TXT +.61, NOC +1.11, BWXT +.56, TDY +3.37, RTX -.56 and ITA $146.05 +1.62 (1.12%).\n \n \nRETAIL was HIGHER with M +.14, JWN +.26, KSS +1.56, DDS +.53, JCP +.004, WMT -.72, TGT +.21, TJX +.84, RL -.90, UAA +.62, LULU +2.87, TPR +.68, CPRI +.79 and XRT $36.53 +.22 (.61%).\n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were HIGHER with GOOGL +26.07, AMZN +19.54, AAPL +4.75, FB +3.71, NFLX +1.74, NVDA +9.21, TSLA +.92, BABA +2.08, BIDU +1.12, CMG +31.46, CAT +.08, BA +7.69, DIS +6.42, and XLK $93.88 +1.85 (2.01%).\n  \n \nFINANCIALS were HIGHER with GS +6.08, JPM +1.51, BAC +.70, MS +1.83, C +1.96, PNC +2.80, AIG +2.25, TRV +2.51, AXP +3.50, V +4.92 and XLF $21.82 +.50 (2.35%).\n \n \nOIL, $24.83 -.79. Oil was higher over-night and the rally continued early in the day to a slightly lower high of $27.79 before falling back and closing down on the day. The stocks were higher across the board with the XLE $37.09 +.94 (2.6%).\n \n \nMETALS, GOLD: $1,725.80 +37.30. After the recent gains, Gold broke below $1,700 and traded as low as $1683.90 before turning higher and breaking out again. last Wednesday. We are long NEM.\n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $10010 +670. After breaking out over $7500 we have consolidated and broken over 8,000 and 8,500 and again consolidated.  Last night I said \u201ctoday\u2019s close is the highest since BTC broke down in early March at $9385 and 9390.  $10,000-10,250 seems like the next stop.\u201d  But I didn\u2019t think it would be today. We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $11.98 +1.23 today.\n \n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

        "selftext": "I was wondering if someone could explain why a stock would suddenly no longer have an option to do a short term call? This morning I sold my short term call on PayPal for a decent profit because it was going to expire tomorrow, now usually on this day a new short term call would expire on the next Friday which the other call on Apple is doing (I\u2019ve done this style a lot so I know it rolls into the next week) but when I went to order a new short term call for PayPal it only allowed me to do a medium or long term. I have seen other stocks randomly do this before but I can\u2019t find why it would no longer be available, does anybody know why the short term call would disappear?",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 4th, 2020.\n\n# **April\u2019s jobs report showing millions out of work looms large in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/01/aprils-jobs-report-showing-millions-out-of-work-looms-large-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Investors will focus on the slow reopening of the economy in the coming week, as Friday\u2019s dismal April employment report is expect to paint a frightening picture of the most rapid job losses in history.\n*****\n&gt; The unemployment rate is expected to jump from 4.4% to over 16.1% in April, the highest level since 1939, according to Dow Jones. Job losses are estimated to total 22 million, slightly below the entire number of jobs that were recovered since the Great Recession.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said the market will likely be able to look past the terrible jobs number as it has done with most bad data, showing the results of a sudden and unprecedented shutdown of the economy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think people are too gloomy about the unemployment situation. I think they think the unemployment rate is going to rise through the summer,\u201d said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont. \u201cI think the unemployment rate probably peaks in May.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Earnings season continues with dozens more companies reporting first-quarter results and talking about the impact of the virus and shutdowns on their businesses. So far, earnings appear to be down 12.7% in the first quarter, based on actual reports and estimates, according to Refinitiv. A diverse group of companies report, including Walt Disney, General Motors, CVS Health and Bristol-Myers Squibb.\n*****\n&gt; But investors are watching the restarting of the economy, now underway at some level in many states. \u201cIf they go well that\u2019s a good thing, but if in a week or two, you start to see some bad virus numbers, that\u2019ll be a blow to confidence,\u201d said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo.\n*****\n&gt; # Best April in years\nStocks started May with a sharp decline Friday, after a 12.7% gain in the S&amp;P 500 in April, its best month since 1987.\n*****\n&gt; Sam Stovall, CFRA chief investment strategist, said the market had been looking forward to the latest extension of fiscal stimulus, approved by Congress, and comments from the Fed, which reaffirmed after its meeting Wednesday that it will do whatever is needed to help the economy. \u201cNow there\u2019s not that much to look forward to,\u201d he said, adding the market would react negatively to any resurgence in the coronavirus outbreak.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe had a very nice April, the best April since 1938. May is sort of a ho-hum month,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cIt\u2019s in the bottom half in terms of average price change, slightly below average in terms of frequency of an advance. \u2026 Just looking at last year, May tends to digest April\u2019s gains.\u201d The S&amp;P 500\u2032s April gain was its best for the month in 82 years.\n*****\n&gt; # Virus economy\nEconomists and market strategists have been tracking the progress of the virus state by state, watching hospitalization rates, new cases and recoveries for clues on how quickly the economy might be able to restart. The economy is expected to have plunged into a deep recession in the second quarter, contracting by 35% or more, after a 4.8% decline in the first quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Stanley said he expects the unemployment rate to be a better-than-consensus 11.6% in April before it rises again in May. \u201cThis is all a stab in the dark,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s not going to come down as quickly as it went up,\u201d said Stanley. \u201cBut I do think you\u2019re going to see steady improvement. I think you\u2019re going to see millions of people brought back into the payrolls for several months in succession. I think we can get out of the double digits [unemployment] by the end of the summer.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Some workers are expected to return to their company payrolls as a result of the small business-focused Paycheck Protection Program, which encourages companies to keep workers on their payroll and bring back those who were cut. But that may not show up until May or June as a factor in the jobs data, Stanley said.\n*****\n&gt; Millions more are expected to have filed for unemployment claims in the week ending May 2, on top of the 30 million who filed in the previous six weeks. Economists say with such big unprecedented numbers, it is difficult to predict the unemployment rate since some people may have been temporarily unemployed and expect to return to work.\n*****\n&gt; But regardless, the number could be a shocker even though the market has shrugged off the big numbers of jobless claims and focused instead on the virus curve flattening.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it could spook people,\u201d said Schumacher. \u201cIn the markets, we\u2019ve been watching the weekly claims, but everybody knows what unemployment is.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stanley said he is also watching Tuesday\u2019s ISM nonmanufacturing data, a look at the services sector during April. A cross section of March data shows it was the services sector that took the biggest hit in the shutdowns, and it\u2019s unclear how quickly it can recover.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere are people who will go and do things as soon as they\u2019re allowed to, and there are people who are going to stay home for a month or two longer,\u201d he said. \u201cI do think expecting we\u2019re going to pack 100,000 people into a football stadium in September is way too optimistic.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stanley said some of the steep drop in consumer spending in March was the result of consumers stopping spending on health care, including elective surgery. That actually is an area that can bounce back quickly once the health care system is up and running for non virus related treatments.\n*****\n&gt; # A new 20-year bond\nThe Treasury could announce its new 20-year bond on Wednesday, when it discloses its quarterly refunding requirements, Schumacher said. He expects about $21 billion of the new 20-year to be issued in the second quarter.\n*****\n&gt; The amount of Treasury debt is expected to grow in the second quarter to help fund the growing deficit, made bigger by the trillions the government is spending to combat the virus.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe supply announcement we think is significant because you\u2019re going to see large auction increases, not just for one month but set in motion for many months to come,\u201d said Schumacher. He expects Treasury to announce $330 billion in notes and bonds in the refunding for the second quarter, up from $240 billion in the first quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury bill issuance is expected at $1.9 trillion in the second quarter but Schumacher expects that to fall to $260 billion in the third quarter. The bills were used to give the Treasury cash to pay for emergency programs and more of that debt will move to long term debt.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/lucZqhO.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ScMf5ki.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/lTrieA0.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/a6RSgrj.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9mfZglW.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Rkt7Uup.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8Ru9JJy.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1L1YEEG.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DwM4sys.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OxcbRYQ.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/zvZWYtm.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/93bme56.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/b57XIzN.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# US Manufacturing Sector Has Entered a Deep Recession\n\n&gt; It is a foregone conclusion that the US economy has entered recession, led by the consumer, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the US economy based on gross domestic product (GDP). The collapse of consumer spending was evident in March personal consumption expenditures data released on Wednesday that showed a record 7.5% month-over-month drop in consumer outlays. It would have been worse if we weren\u2019t stocking our refrigerators and pantries.\n\n&gt; The manufacturing sector is also contracting sharply, not surprisingly given the business shutdowns that began in March. Investors had a glimpse of the extent of the hit to manufacturing in the business investment component of first quarter GDP, which revealed a sharp 8.6% annualized decline, durable goods orders for March, which fell 14.4%, and Markit\u2019s preliminary Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) for manufacturing in April that came in at 36.9, a level consistent with a severe recession.\n\n&gt; Today\u2019s Institute for Supply Management (ISM) PMI for manufacturing\u2014the so-called official PMI\u2014provided more evidence of the depth of the manufacturing downturn. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the headline index fell 7.6 points to 41.5, better than Bloomberg\u2019s consensus forecast of 36, but a level consistent with prior recessions.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ISM-Chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; But that\u2019s the good news. Peeling back the onion in this report reveals that the headline number was inflated by the supplier deliveries component. Normally, lengthening supplier delivery times reflect strong demand, which prevents suppliers from keeping up. However, in this environment, it reflects supply chain disruptions from lockdowns around the world related to COVID-19.\n\n&gt; The new orders and employment components of the report, which both fell more than 15 points to around 27, are better indicators of where manufacturing activity in the US is right now. The new orders number just missed the December 2008 level of 25.9, while the employment component hit its lowest level since 1949, putting the slump into proper perspective.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe more forward-looking components of the ISM report clearly indicate the manufacturing sector is in the midst of one of the sharpest contractions ever,\u201d said LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. \u201cGiven the close relationship between manufacturing activity and corporate profits, the 25% cut to S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates for 2020 that we\u2019ve seen since March 1 is probably not enough.\u201d\n\n&gt; The ISM report points to a sharp upcoming drop in capital investment and a huge hit to earnings in the second quarter\u2014potentially down 40% year over year (FactSet consensus is calling for a 38% year-over-year decline in S&amp;P 500 earnings).\n\n&gt; Looking ahead, while the economic impact of the global lockdowns has been severe, we continue to be reassured by developing plans to reopen the economy, progress toward treatments and vaccines, and the resolve of Americans to get through this. We continue to expect a very strong rebound in manufacturing and the broad economy later this year.\n\n*****\n\n# Global Central Banks All In\n\n&gt; The Federal Reserve (Fed), the European Central Bank (ECB), and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) all met in the last week and while the show of power was minimal compared to recent weeks, they collectively reasserted their resolve to do whatever is necessary to support the global economy through the COVID-19 economic crisis. Rates are being held about as low as they can go, significant new programs to enhance market liquidity and support lending are in place, and, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, asset purchases have accelerated. In fact, with April not yet completed, central bank assets have risen over $3 trillion, the biggest two-month jump on record.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe central bank response to COVID-19 has been fast, effective, and built to impress,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAnd the market is seeing it. It\u2019s no coincidence that the market bottomed the day after the Fed rolled out a wide range of new programs addressing key areas of market and economic disruption.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Blog-Chart-20-04-30.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Overview of Recent Central Bank Activity\n\n&gt; The Fed concluded its most recent two-day meeting on Wednesday, April 29. Prior to the meeting the Fed had expanded its program supporting municipalities by lowering the minimum size of the city or county to qualify. The Fed left its target rate unchanged at 0 \u2013 0.25%. Through its policy statement and Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s comments, the Fed signaled that it is unlikely to remove its extraordinary policy support anytime soon, and we believe the Fed may hold its policy rate near zero into 2022. Asset purchases are currently open-ended and have expanded to include investment-grade and high-yield corporate exchange-traded funds.\n\n&gt; The BOJ met on Monday, April 27 and announced that it would lift its cap on buying government bonds, making purchases open ended, and triple the size of its corporate bond commercial debt purchases.\n\n&gt; The ECB met on Thursday, April 30 and announced new refinancing operations and that it would ease conditions on long-term loans to banks, encouraging banks to increase lending.\n\n&gt; With interest rates near zero, all major central banks have been expanding their economic support through new programs and increased asset purchases. Central bank are showing that in a time of crisis, their policy response is not limited to setting policy rates or even bond purchases. The expanded activity has all but eliminated the idea that the central banks are out of ammunition, both now and looking forward. There will come a time when these programs will end, balance sheets will unwind, and rates will rise. But until that time, central banks have shown that even prudent support in a time of economic distress is only limited by their imagination, keeping the old investing maxim \u201cDon\u2019t fight the Fed\u201d alive even in an age of zero rates.\n\n*****\n\n# Typical May Trading: A Month of Transition with Negative Predisposition\n\n&gt; Once again it is that time of the year where we increasingly see and hear \u201cSell in May.\u201d But when exactly in May is the \u201cbest\u201d time to sell? Based upon the last 21 years of data, the best time could be early in May. The month has opened well, on average, recently with strength on the first trading day and on the second trading day for the most part. Afterwards, DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 all tend to drift sideways to lower until around May\u2019s sixteenth trading day or so. It is on this day the NASDAQ and Russell 2000 begin to rally to finish the month. Beware though, this late-May rally typically fizzles before it can exceed the highs reached earlier in the month.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1df0a9e6bf9c57baf44e6917725a0b23/49574a3950141284-4d/s500x750/4f224d3ee89c6ef6d69c08facbac61a77da3fd3b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# This is Still an Election Year\n\n&gt; We have all been rather preoccupied with the coronavirus pandemic, market volatility and our individual situation. Meanwhile there is still a U.S. Presidential Election taking place this year. And folks are beginning to wonder what the next political alignment might be and the ramifications that alignment has had on the market historically.\n\n&gt; Six possible political alignments exist in Washington: Republican President with a Republican congress, Democratic congress or split Congress; and a Democratic President with a Democratic Congress, Republican Congress or split Congress. Data presented in the chart below begin in 1949 with the first full presidential term following WWII.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dce5f19dd2ccfc16a4e0795dd5a11f68/8033867962439c40-45/s500x750/8543ffd66d568035ffa681a3d72b861c8f84b996.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Election years are traditionally up years. Incumbent administrations shamelessly attempt to massage the economy so voters will keep them in power. But sometimes overpowering events occur and the market crumbles, usually resulting in a change of political control.\n\n&gt; Republicans won in 1920 (DJIA -32.9%) as the post-war economy contracted and President Wilson ailed. The Democrats came back during the 1932 (-23.1%) Depression when the Dow hit its lowest level of the 20th century. A world at war and the fall of France jolted the market in 1940 (-12.7%), but Roosevelt won an unprecedented third term. Cold War confrontations and Truman\u2019s historic upset of Dewey held markets down through the end of 1948 (-2.1%). Recently the Great Recession and bear market of 2008 (-33.8%) helped put Obama and the Democrats back in the White House.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fe57b47990e4b1b913e16595818a4df4/8033867962439c40-ea/s500x750/b5004568a1ca04f9004d23bd405de22f277408f2.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# 10-Day Advance/Decline Lines Running Hot\n\n&gt; The gains in the first half of the week lifted every sector but two\u2014Utilities and Financials\u2014above their 50-DMAs. Meanwhile, Health Care had even touched overbought territory (over 1 standard deviation above its 50-day) earlier in the week, making it the first sector to be overbought since late February.\n\n&gt; When it comes to another measure we monitor, the 10-day advance/decline line, conditions are more broadly appearing overbought. The 10-day advance/decline line measures the average number of daily advancers minus decliners in an index or sector over the last 10 trading days. Very high readings suggest that things have gotten extended in the very near term and downside mean reversion can be expected. Very low reading suggest the opposite.\n\n&gt; The 10-day A/D lines for sectors have been pretty strong recently indicating broad participation in the rally, but this has led these readings to become elevated indicating conditions may be running a bit too hot in the near term. Outside of the defensive sectors like Consumer Staples, Utilities, and Real Estate, every sector's 10-day A/D line has been in overbought territory at some point over the past week. The same can also be said for the 10-day A/D line for the S&amp;P 500. We'd note, though, that while A/D lines are extended, they're not at extreme levels seen at other points over the past year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/10day.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

        "selftext": "For Trading MAY 8th\n \n \nNASDAQ Up on the Year\n \nAll the other Indexes Still Down\n \nEarnings Galore\n \n \nToday\u2019s market was another big open followed by sideways action all day and then the DJIA and S&amp;P finished on their lows.  The DJIA was +211.25 (.89%), NASDAQ +126.27 (1.41%), S&amp;P 500 +.32.77 (1.15%), the Russell +19.92 (1.58%) and the Transports +118.76 (1.5%).  The DJIA was split 16 up, 14 down with the biggest winner\u2019s BA +46, GS +37, HD +36, MCD +28 and V +27 DPs.  The only double-digit loser was UNH -26 DPs.  The strong sectors were Energy, Financials and materials and the weaker Consumer staples and healthcare.  Market internals were 2.5:1 up on the NYSE and 2.2:1 on NASDAQ.  Volume was light again.\nUnemployment numbers for April come at 8:30 tomorrow morning.  \n \n \nOur \u201copen forum\u201d on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.  It is informative and allows me to share insights as the market is open and moving.  The link is: https://discord.gg/ATvC7YZ  and I will be there and active from before the open and all day.  It\u2019s a great place to share ideas and gain some insights, and we\u2019ve grown to almost 1900 members.  I also did this video titled \u201cHow to survive being an options trader and not blow up your account,\u201d over the long weekend.  I think it\u2019s very informative as a guide to stock selection and option choices.  The link is\nhttps://youtu.be/Y7H9RpWfLlo  Enjoy!!\n \nTonight\u2019s closing comment video\nhttps://youtu.be/gmdS65mok0Q\n \nSECTORS: Earnings played a part in today\u2019s market again.  The follow-thru from yesterday\u2019s numbers pushed PYPL +18 (14%) and LYFT +5.66 (21.7%).  Today\u2019s numbers were a mix with the hospitality booking firms the biggest losers.  BKNG was a miss and after closing $1443.91 +65 it fell as low as 1,381 -63 but bounced back to close $1,440 \u2013 only $3.91.  Trip Advisor (TRIP) was not quite so lucky.  They missed top and bottom lines and after closing $18.72 +.63 it fell to $17.35 and finished $17.86 -.86, but it is down 40% YTD.  \n \nUber reported horrendous numbers and it had closed $30.93 +3.11 on the strength of yesterdays LYFT numbers but the losses increased, and the company posted a loss of $2.9 billion vs. $1.4B expected and the stock fell to $29.50 before the CEO came on the call and spread some BS pixie dust about the last 4 weeks improving, but at the same time withdrew the guidance going forward.  He also said that UBER Eats grew, but that they lose money on every delivery.  At that point the stock turned and ran up to $34.19 before closing $32.80 + about $5 on the day.  Unbelievable.\n \nROKU reported a beat on revenues but another loss.  The stock had closed $137.50 +9.98 and guidance is for no profit in either 2020 or 2021.  The stock sold off to $123.11 and finished $123.50 -14.00 (3.73%).\n \n \nFOOD SUPPLY: was MIXED with TSN +2.62, BGS -.35, FLO +.14, CAG -.60, MDLZ +.02, KHC -.48, CALM +.84, JJSF +1.30, SAFM +5.91 and LANC -2.34.\n \n \nBIOPHARMA: was HIGHER with BIIB +7.22, ABBV -.96, REGN +6.55, ISRG +24.09, GILD +.38, MYL +.54, TEVA +1.06 (10.11%), VRTX +.94, BHC -1.27, INCY +.39, ICPT -3.34, LABU +.24 and IBB $127.17 +.17 (.13%).\n \nCANNABIS: This group was HIGHER with TLRY +.28, CGC +.16, CRON +.13, GWPH -.02, ACB +.003, PYX +.15, NBEV +.07, CURLF +.11, KERN +.28 and MJ $11.82 +.05 (.42%).\n\n \nDEFENSE: was HIGHER with LMT -.58, GD +5.79, TXT +.61, NOC +1.11, BWXT +.56, TDY +3.37, RTX -.56 and ITA $146.05 +1.62 (1.12%).\n \n \nRETAIL was HIGHER with M +.14, JWN +.26, KSS +1.56, DDS +.53, JCP +.004, WMT -.72, TGT +.21, TJX +.84, RL -.90, UAA +.62, LULU +2.87, TPR +.68, CPRI +.79 and XRT $36.53 +.22 (.61%).\n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were HIGHER with GOOGL +26.07, AMZN +19.54, AAPL +4.75, FB +3.71, NFLX +1.74, NVDA +9.21, TSLA +.92, BABA +2.08, BIDU +1.12, CMG +31.46, CAT +.08, BA +7.69, DIS +6.42, and XLK $93.88 +1.85 (2.01%).\n  \n \nFINANCIALS were HIGHER with GS +6.08, JPM +1.51, BAC +.70, MS +1.83, C +1.96, PNC +2.80, AIG +2.25, TRV +2.51, AXP +3.50, V +4.92 and XLF $21.82 +.50 (2.35%).\n \n \nOIL, $24.83 -.79. Oil was higher over-night and the rally continued early in the day to a slightly lower high of $27.79 before falling back and closing down on the day. The stocks were higher across the board with the XLE $37.09 +.94 (2.6%).\n \n \nMETALS, GOLD: $1,725.80 +37.30. After the recent gains, Gold broke below $1,700 and traded as low as $1683.90 before turning higher and breaking out again. last Wednesday. We are long NEM.\n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $10010 +670. After breaking out over $7500 we have consolidated and broken over 8,000 and 8,500 and again consolidated.  Last night I said \u201ctoday\u2019s close is the highest since BTC broke down in early March at $9385 and 9390.  $10,000-10,250 seems like the next stop.\u201d  But I didn\u2019t think it would be today. We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $11.98 +1.23 today.\n \n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",
