This DD is split into 8 parts, so feel free to jump to whichever section you\u2019re most interested in.\n\n**Part 1 \u2013 Introduction**\n\n**Part 2 \u2013 Market Trends and Upcoming Catalysts**\n\n**Part 3 \u2013 Company Overview and Unique Value Proposition**\n\n**Part 4 \u2013 Recent Updates**\n\n**Part 5 \u2013 Financials and Valuation**\n\n**Part 6 \u2013 Bear Case**\n\n**Part 7 \u2013 SI and Squeeze Potential**\n\n**Part 8 \u2013 TL;DR**\n\n**Part 1 \u2013 Introduction**\n\nIt was a warm Monday morning on August 23rd almost a month back, when seemingly for no reason \u2013 **GOEV shot up from ~$5.9 to ~$8, a 30% gain on the day.** The next day \u2013 GME popped, for a 30% gain as well, with AMC and BB also making up big gains, leading to the \u2018meme mania\u2019 we\u2019ve been experiencing for the last couple of weeks. \n\nWhy\u2019d this happen? Well there were no company/industry catalysts. The only event that seemed to occur in the prior week was the expiration of monthly options. One of the theories going around is that there\u2019s an almost quarterly cycle going on at this point where FTD\u2019s are leading to a surge in prices in the next cycle for \u2018meme stocks\u2019 which tend to be heavily shorted for the most part. How accurate this is I have no clue and whether this applies to GOEV I don\u2019t know, haven\u2019t investigated that particular theory but there\u2019s plenty of posts/comments floating around for you to look into if you\u2019re so inclined. \n\nThe quick point I\u2019m trying to make here is that if a heavily shorted stock is popping 30% in a day, with no major catalyst for the industry or the company in question \u2013 and that company is now advancing towards realizing its major milestones with favorable tailwinds expected for the sector, it could pop a lot more than 30% in the months to come. **GOEV is among the youngest EV companies - having been around for less than 5 years, with arguably the most unique vehicles coming out (on schedule \u2013 seems to be pretty amazing in the EV space) that very few, if any, of the established or other up and coming competitors are producing, and has been shorted more it seems \u2013 for the failure of its peers than any real fault of its own.**\n\n**Part 2 \u2013 Market Trends and Upcoming Catalysts**\n\n* From an investment into equities point of view \u2013 S&amp;P 500 has fallen about 0.5%, on average, during the month of September. Stocks have tended to go up, on average, during every other month \u2014 other than a slight dip in February \u2014 over the past half century [link]( https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/01/investing/stock-market-september/index.html). However, this may soon be coming to an end as in the past week Investors stampeded into stocks and out of cash as global equity funds witnessed their biggest inflows since March 2021 while large-cap U.S. funds enjoyed a record haul, a weekly round-up by BofA showed. [link](https://www.investing.com/news/economy/monster-reallocations-to-stocks-as-us-tax-threat-recedes--bofa-2619022) \n\n* Let\u2019s take a look at the EV market dynamics and upcoming catalysts before getting into GOEV specifically, so we get a high-level understanding of the bigger picture. The global EV market is expected to be valued at $725.1 Billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 27.19% from $171.26 in 2021 [source](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/electric-vehicle-market). This is expected to grow to $1.007 trillion by 2027 which is an average of 2 sources - [source 1](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/electric-vehicle-market-analysis-size-regional-outlook-competitive-strategies-and-forecasts-to-2027-2021-07-12?tesla=y), [source 2](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/electric-vehicle-market-size-to-be-valued-at-1-212-1-billion-by-2027-owing-to-rising-number-of-government-initiatives-globally-to-promote-manufacturing--adoption-of-evs--million-insights-301238118.html), another source actually has the market valued at $2.5 trillion but it\u2019s a bit of an outlier compared to the other 2 [source 3](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/11/2227050/0/en/Electric-Vehicle-EV-Market-Worth-2-495-4-Billion-by-2027-Growing-at-a-CAGR-of-33-6-From-2020-Exclusive-Report-by-Meticulous-Research.html).   \n\n* Global EV forecast is for a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent achieved over the next ten years: Total EV sales growing from 2.5 million in 2020 to 11.2 million in 2025, then reaching 31.1 million by 2030. EVs would secure approximately 32 per cent of the total market share for new car sales.  Despite the pressure exerted on the market by the COVID-19 pandemic, the long-term outlook for EVs is strong. The significant shift in expected volume of BEVs and PHEVs by 2030 is based on four factors: consumer sentiment, policy and regulation, OEM strategy and the role of corporate companies. All four of these factors saw major changes in direction over the last year, prior to the emergence of COVID-19, and have since been shaped further by the pandemic. [link](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/future-of-mobility/electric-vehicle-trends-2030.html) \n\n* In November 2018, an article came out stating that the number of EVs on U.S. roads was projected to reach 18.7 million in 2030, up from 1 million at the end of 2018. This is about 7 percent of the 259 million vehicles (cars and light trucks) expected to be on U.S. roads in 2030. Annual sales of EVs will exceed 3.5 million vehicles in 2030, reaching more than 20 percent of annual vehicle sales in 2030. About 9.6 million charge ports will be required to support 18.7 million EVs in 2030. This represents a significant investment in EV charging infrastructure. [link]( https://www.eei.org/resourcesandmedia/newsroom/Pages/Press%20Releases/EEI%20Celebrates%201%20Million%20Electric%20Vehicles%20on%20U-S-%20Roads.aspx). \n\n* As it turns out, that number of annual EV sales of 3.5 million vehicles in 2030 was revised to almost double of that in a November 2020 report, just 2 years after the previous article. The US electric vehicles market is now expected to reach 6.9 million unit sales by 2025, up 5x from 1.4 million unit sales forecast for 2020, due to government incentives driving EV ownership. Over 90% of states offered incentives for setting up EV charging infrastructure, with meaningful quality of life incentives and exemptions are offered across 39 states in the US, including easier payment plans for the purchase of EVs, limited-time incentives to accelerate EV adoption/conversion and lack of requirements for emission inspections across several states. [link]( https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/111920-us-ev-market-sales-to-rise-to-69-million-units-by-2025-frost-amp-sullivan)\n\n* President Biden is seeking a pledge from auto manufacturers that would see EVs make up 40% - 50% of new U.S. vehicle sales by 2030 [link 1](https://www.forbes.com/wheels/news/40-percent-evs-2030/), [link 2](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/biden-set-target-50-evs-by-2030-industry-backs-goal-2021-08-05/) which is double of the 20% forecast just three years earlier in 2018, and would likely occur only with strong support on the supply side through infrastructural and other support that would enable EV manufacturers to develop the capacity to produce the target number of vehicles, and demand side with respect to incentivizing people to purchase EVs. \n\n* EV tax credits jump to $12,500 in proposed $3.5 trillion budget blueprint Democrats passed a couple of weeks ago. This bill adds $4,500 to the current $7,500 tax credit available for a total of $12,500 potentially available to EV buyers. It includes passenger vehicles and light-duty trucks. The proposal calls for $160 billion to fund subsidies and purchase incentives, EV charging infrastructure funding, EV manufacturing incentives, federal EV procurement requirements, and incentives to electrify heavy-duty commercial fleets. [link](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/ev-tax-credit-bill-biden/) \n\n* The proposed EV credits in the budget blueprint would last for 10 years and consumers would be allowed to deduct the value of the credit from the sales price at the time of purchase. In 2027, the $7,500 credit would only apply to U.S.-made vehicles. It would also create a new smaller credit for used EVs of up to $2,500. There are also lower credits for EVs with smaller battery packs. The bill says individual taxpayers must have an adjusted gross income of no more than $400,000 to get the new EV tax credit. It would limit the EV credit to cars priced at no more than $55,000, while trucks could be priced up to $74,000. In August, the Senate in a non-binding amendment narrowly voted in favor of prohibiting taxpayers from claiming EV tax credits if they make more than $100,000 annually or if vehicles cost more than $40,000. [link](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/11/us-democrats-propose-dramatic-expansion-of-ev-tax-credits-that-favors-big-three.html) \n\n* Furthermore, the bipartisan infrastructure plan, titled the American Jobs Plan, includes billions of dollars for other electrification efforts and for a national charging network. Specifically, the bipartisan plan includes $7.5 billion for a network of EV charging stations across the country. It also includes another $7.5 billion for electric buses and other transportation methods. [link](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/biden-infrastructure-ev-subsidies-charging-network/)  \n\n* States area also providing EV incentives to residents e.g. Gov. JB Pritzker signed Illinois\u2019 clean energy law which includes a $4,000 rebate for residents to buy an electric vehicle (EV). [link](https://www.mystateline.com/news/local-news/illinois-wants-to-give-you-4000-to-buy-an-electric-vehicle/). \n\n* By 2030, there\u2019s expected to be an 8% divergence between EV demand estimates and production plans, meaning there needs to be a massive scaling up of infrastructure/capacity of EV manufacturers over current projections in order to fill the gap in the market. [link](https://gyazo.com/66173e4431b4c6b30ac7ed0662f13f1c) \n\n**Part 2 \u2013 Company Overview and Unique Value Proposition**\n\n**Before we look into what\u2019s happened since my last post, let\u2019s go over a quick refresher on what the company does.** Canoo is a Los Angeles-based company that has developed breakthrough electric vehicles, with over 650 employees [link](https://investors.canoo.com/news-presentations/press-releases/detail/65/canoo-receives-initial-aa-esg-leader-rating-from-msci) from leading technology and automotive companies [link](https://www.canoo.com/about/). Canoo\u2019s Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that the company was focused on a product lineup that fits in the gaps of everybody else\u2019s lineup\u2026 take the turning radius of a Prius, the size of a Ford Ranger, Payload of F-150 and sell it as one vehicle [link](https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=1747). What makes this Canoo so special compared to other EVs is their modular platform, which is purpose-built to deliver maximum vehicle interior space and adaptable to support a wide range of vehicle applications for consumers and businesses. \n\nIt is this modular platform that led to Apple\u2019s interest and having talks with Canoo (the talks are assumed to have fallen apart because Canoo was looking for an investor while Apple was looking to for an acquisition), as the platform is different from ones developed by other startups and larger automakers because it integrates more of the car\u2019s electronics, allowing for greater flexibility in cabin design. It also features steer-by-wire technology, which also increases design flexibility and is not yet widely adopted in the industry. [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev).\n\nApple wasn\u2019t the only major company interested in Canoo, Hyundai Motor Group (Hyundai and Kia\u2019s parent company) actually went a lot farther than Apple did with Canoo, announcing a partnership in February 2020 to develop new electric vehicles based on the technological platform developed by Canoo [link](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia). This was extremely unusual and referred to as a significant victory for Canoo, as \u2018pretty much every electric vehicle startup has talked about wanting to license out their technology or partner with legacy automakers, almost none have landed a deal\u2026 Canoo now joins that small list despite only coming into existence at the end of 2017, when its founders started the company\u2019 [link](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia). \n\nUltimately this partnership did not go ahead because Canoo\u2019s chairman didn\u2019t feel as though it was worth it for Canoo, saying that the original deal with Hyundai didn\u2019t factor in the value of Canoo\u2019s IP, so a shift in strategy was made from licensing out the technology to protecting the IP and manufacturing and selling Canoo\u2019s own vehicles to commercial operators [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357318/canoo-hyundai-deal-dead-electric-vehicles-goev) \n\nRegarding the technology/IP - Canoo has developed the world\u2019s flattest skateboard platform, which enables class-leading passenger and cargo volume on a small vehicle footprint. For example, the lifestyle vehicle, which will offer the interior space of a large SUV, but on the exterior footprint of a compact car. To help achieve this, Canoo\u2019s suspension utilizes a double wishbone with two fiberglass leaf springs, mounted transversely in the front and rear of the platform. The dampers are mounted to the frame, eliminating the need for large shock towers that take up vital cabin space. The entire suspension system is incorporated into the skateboard and sits below the height of the tires. [link](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-shows-off-performance-and-versatility-of-skateboard-platform-for-the-first-time-in-video).\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the current automotive model and see how Canoo\u2019s approach and the use of the skateboard platform add so much more value than conventional ICE manufacturers [link](https://gyazo.com/041f5f426804ab087740da6c5b0b1aeb), currently the model is broken because 70-80% of the portion of vehicle lifetime profit is only generated after the first owner. The current model is geared towards the first owner and nothing more, with an assortment of OEMs/spare parts retailers/3rd party installers servicing vehicles after the initial sale. Canoo aims to change this by targeting multiple owners after the first purchase i.e. owners 2-4, offering customers the ability to upgrade the model of whichever vehicle they have or switch them entirely as the platform on which the vehicles are built is the same [link](https://gyazo.com/272959d52f3e8c169c711e9b18dbd98c). \n\nThe use, and subsequent re-use of the skateboard platform enables significant cost savings and risk reductions [link](https://gyazo.com/7ade9dac03f0e6fcbffc6b8f3942eb4c), with the platform providing a strong business advantage as it is consistent across Canoo\u2019s vehicle lineup. If a project is started for a new vehicle which will have the skateboard platform as its foundation, they will be able to carryover engineer and labor, ~half, from one project to the next. It\u2019s also worth pointing out that in traditional ICE, it would be exceptional if Bill of Materials cost carryover across variants reached 25%, with Canoo, this is exceeding 50%. The specific savings include:\n\n* 45% - 55% labor savings for new variants developed\n\n* 57% of the BOM cost carryover across variants\n\n* &gt;70% of critical functions are delivered by the platform.\n\nThese enable the development of space efficient cabins that integrate simply onto platform [link](https://gyazo.com/0a5777ed4387d9d9916a0c0d949f452e), and provide the key basis for engineering Canoo\u2019s new value proposition of having a harmonized and articulated 3 \u2013 layer vehicle concept that keeps fresh and returns capital over an entire vehicle lifecycle [link](https://gyazo.com/7992fbead2e3c724ec002333b8c909c8). This image also showcases how Canoo aims to capture the full vehicle lifecycle value [link](https://gyazo.com/ca0abdaece1006dbb34ad42b60bb2977) \n\nThe three vehicles that Canoo has publicly announced as part of its lineup are:\n\nLifestyle vehicle [link](https://www.canoo.com/canoo/) - Fully electric, highly versatile and offering more utility inside and out for city explorers, businesses, families and adventurers. The multi-purpose platform unlocks SUV-size interior space on a smaller exterior footprint. It\u2019s pretty hard to put into an image of the vehicle into words so I\u2019d recommend clicking on the above link to check it out for yourself. Some key figures (note the range provided in certain cases is for the variants):\n\n* Launching late 2022.\n\n* Starting at $34,750*\n\n* 2 seats - 5 seats - 7 seats\n\n* 250 mi range\n\n* Up to 350 Horsepower \n\n* 28min charge time 80%\n\n* 188 ft\u00b3 interior volume\n\n* 80 KWh battery\n\n* 1,464 lbs payload \u2013 2,000 lbs capacity\n\nMulti-purpose Delivery Vehicle [link](https://www.canoo.com/mpdv/) \u2013 Business ready vehicle that lowers the total cost of ownership while providing easy maintenance. More cargo in a small footprint to enable easy maneuverability. A productivity tool that enables you to plug in your tools and get to work. Some key figures (note the range provided in certain cases is for the variants):\n\n* Starting at $33,000*\n\n* 200 ft\u00b3 - 500 ft\u00b3 cargo volume\n\n* 130 \u2013 230 mi, 90 \u2013 190 mi range (EPA)\n\n* 1,540 to 1,980 lbs\n\nPickup [link](https://www.canoo.com/pickup/) \u2013 All Electric, All American, All Utility - The Pickup Truck is built to be the new standard in function, form and utility \u2014 ready for work and the weekend. The picup truck is as strong as the toughest trucks out there and includes features for people who use trucks on the job, weekend, and adventure. Some key figures (note the range provided in certain cases is for the variants):\n\n* Launching as early as 2023.\n\n* Price \u2013 Not currently listed, but during the Q&amp;A portion of the investor day portion on June 30th, somebody asked what the base pricing for the pickup was, given that the Ford lightning F-150 base price was being advertised at $32,000. Chairman Tony Aquila said Canoo was not prepared to announce the pricing at that time, but Canoo would not be beaten in this category \u2013 you can check it out at the following link [link](https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=10908)  \n\n* Targeted HP \u2013 500+\n\n* Payload Capacity \u2013 1800 lbs\n\n* Range \u2013 200+ mi\n\n* Powertrain \u2013 AWD or RWD\n\nThere\u2019s actually a fourth vehicle as well that hasn\u2019t been listed anywhere officially but was found by /u/Mcardiel007 when he was having issues communicating with Canoo and went to their Torrance location and spotted them unloading what is potentially the new sedan. All credits to him/her for the following pictures [pic 1](https://gyazo.com/5e84005c8399352f2de9efbedeb3d933), [pic 2](https://gyazo.com/608a14d42df52284544bfbf0cf4a2912?token=1800737b805fc34222e29805d032b29c), [pic 3](https://gyazo.com/906b46f350bed3e4ed10357422bf548a), [pic 4](https://gyazo.com/5dd4b620f07fcb72fdb2234dfc35a36a), [pic 5](https://gyazo.com/83e23a1219e08bd6a2d118138121a714). \n\nWe can see that Canoo is targeting the most attractive segments at a lower incremental cost. The most profitable and highest carbon dioxide emitting segments are pickups and SUVs, with $115B+ accounting for 90% of 2020 profit pool in US, and ~60% of the transportation emissions (Canoo is targeting these segments with its Lifestyle Vehicle and Pickup). One of the fastest growing segments is delivery vans, with ~2M more delivery vehicles needed globally by 2030 [link](https://gyazo.com/309703e692c4a4fa96cd91096b593ac4). It\u2019s important to keep in mind existing fleet conversion to EV as well. Using the common platform provides a pivot-ability to focus on high margin products and is a large and profitable opportunity \u2013 highly lucrative and accretive to overall margin [link](https://gyazo.com/51a7448bc7b0c236d6c4b528eb662dda). \n\nCanoo is also looking at car data and not just strictly being a vehicle manufacturer \u2013 with an opportunity for harmonizing hardware and software + superior cleaning leading to actionable data instead of the status quo of outsourced hardware + poor cleaning leading to disjointed data. Each connected vehicle offers 1 \u2013 2 TB of raw data per day, with car data monetization globally valued at $250 Billion - $400 Billion [link](https://gyazo.com/d1e6a55ce2f1bb3777020592281afe8f).\n\nTo sum it up \u2013 Canoo is well-positioned for success with a differentiated business model [link](https://gyazo.com/6b0ce0f9af42b090b04e970aafe696fe), developing exceptional products that are aimed at the most profitable segments ($115B+ for 90% 2020 profit pool) in the US, addressing upfitting and accessories market in the US by monetizing full vehicle lifetime value with emphasis on 2nd, 3rd and 4th customers (valued at $24B+), and monetization of car data globally through customer-centric, software ecosystem generating exponential network effect ($250B+).\n\n**Part 4 \u2013 Recent Updates**\n\n**Now let\u2019s take a look at some of the hires that the company\u2019s been making (note that almost all of these hires have happened since the last quarter, with most being in the last two months, and this is not an exhaustive list).

The facility will be built on a 400-acre site at the MidAmerica Industrial Park complex in Pryor, Oklahoma. It will house a paint shop, body shop, and general assembly plant. Oklahoma is providing an incentive package that totals over $300 million, and may kick in millions more based on whether Canoo hits or exceeds a target of hiring military veterans to make up 10 percent of the workforce at the facility [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538811/canoo-ev-factory-oklahoma-electric-vehicles-vdl-nedcar).\n\nPartnering with VDL Nedcar as a contract manufacturing partner to manufacture the Lifestyle Vehicle for the US &amp; EU markets while it builds its US-based mega micro-factory. By parallel pathing contract and owned manufacturing Canoo will meet its commitment to start production and deliver vehicles in Q4, 2022. Canoo Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that VDL Nedcar \u2018is the top trusted European manufacturer building high quality products for leading OEMs, and they significantly outcompeted the other contenders. VDL is also independently owned by the van der Leegte family of entrepreneurs - which aligns with our commitment to support businesses that form the backbone of communities.

Lafferty - $19 [link](https://www.investing.com/news/rf-lafferty-stick-to-their-buy-rating-for-canoo-2568124) \n\n* H.C. Wainright - $15 [link](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-goev-a-buy-or-sell-right-now-2021-09/) \n\n* Bank of America - $5 (can\u2019t find the article at the moment but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve seen it somewhere)\n\nAverage = $13, current SP = $6.7\n\nAs of Canoo\u2019s second quarter 10Q, the company had cash on hand of $563.6 million [link](https://investors.canoo.com/financial-information/balance-sheet), which according to the company is more than sufficient to cover the cost of bringing its first products to markets [link](https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=9398). \n\nThe company could raise $273M from warrants if the SP is greater than $18 for 20 out of 30 days.\n\nAt a pre-revenue stage there\u2019s not too much to say in this department, other than to note that value of a couple of orders:\n\n* Over 9,500 non-binding preorders \u2013 which if they are followed through with would be worth at least $313,500,00 (assuming 9,500 orders of the cheapest vehicle which is the base model MPDV).\n\n* 10,000 MPDVs for the frontdoor collective which would be worth at least $330,000,000 (assuming cheapest MPDV).\n\nAs far as valuations go, let\u2019s divide the pre-revenue EV manufacturers into tiers for an easier look \u2013 based on their market cap. I\u2019m sure some are missing because I only took a few, let me know and I\u2019ll add them in later. These market caps were taken within a few moments of each other on 9/21 from yahoo finance.\n\n* Lucid Motors \u2013 $41.23B, 11,000 pre-orders, delivery delayed to fall 2021\n\n* Nikola Corporation - $4.25B, lowered delivery guidance of 25/50 vehicles for 2021 \n\n* Fisker Inc - $3.917B, &gt;17,000 pre-orders, value of $637,483,000 \n\n* Faraday Future - $3.66B, 300 FF 91 Vehicles, value of $54,000,000 delivery in 2022 \n\n* Canoo \u2013 $1.63B, 19,500 pre-orders (9,500 individual + 10,000 front door collective), value of $643,500,000, delivery fall 2022 for LV, 2023 for MPDV \n\n* Company A (market cap too low, has a DOJ investigation ongoing and issued a going concern for whether it would have cash to make it to production) - $1.2B\n\nJust looking at a couple of examples here it would seem that Canoo is undervalued purely on a pre-orders/revenue perspective. Fisker and Faraday Future, which are both expected to deliver in 2022 as is the case with Canoo, have over double the market cap despite Canoo having similar preorder value (compared to Fisker) or much higher (compared to Faraday Future). Haven\u2019t done a cash flow analysis of every company but even taking into consideration Fisker having $400M more in cash on hand [source](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-242552/), there\u2019s a significant discrepancy. Faraday Future meanwhile has less than half of Canoo\u2019s cash on hand at $230M [link](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-242552/).  \n\n**Part 6 \u2013 Bear Case**\n\nWith anything pre-revenue, the biggest issue is always going to be do we have enough cash to get the product off the ground imo. I could write a really long paragraph but yea that\u2019s pretty much it in a sentence. Since I\u2019m on the bullish side for the company, I\u2019ll lay out a few reasons why I think Canoo won\u2019t be running out of $$$ before it comes to market \u2013 these have mostly been stated here and there throughout this document but I\u2019ll summarize them below:\n\n* As of Canoo\u2019s second quarter 10Q, the company had cash on hand of $563.6 million which according to the company is more than sufficient to cover the cost of bringing the Lifestyle Vehicle to market. \n\n* Oklahoma is providing an incentive package that totals over $300 million, and may kick in millions more based on whether Canoo hits or exceeds a target of hiring military veterans to make up 10 percent of the workforce at the facility.\n\n* EV funding is a significant portion of the upcoming budget, this is less grounded than the others but there is assumedly some hopium that Canoo would be able to receive some federal support if needed.\n\n* The company could take on debt to assist in getting to production \u2013 H.C. Wainwright in their coverage indicated that they expect $500M to $525M in funding could be raised in debt to 2023. Tony has previously stated that they are looking for as non-dilutive an approach as possible, and given the current SP it wouldn\u2019t make much sense to go the additional equity route.\n\n* In May, the SEC opened a fact-finding inquiry into Canoo as it did with many former EV SPACs, unlike others such as NKLA and (Company A) \u2013 nothing further has come as of yet, nor have any DOJ investigations been launched.\n\n**Part 7 \u2013 SI and Squeeze Potential**\n\nI know y\u2019all have just been waiting for this so I\u2019ll get right down to it. Famously developed by the esteemed /u/pennyether, the SMELL system is going to help us take a look at some key numbers that\u2019ll help understand GOEV\u2019s squeezability.\n\n* Short Interest \u2013 31.8 million shares, 32% of free float \n\n* Market Cap \u2013 $1.63 Billion, not big enough that it\u2019s immovable, not small enough that shorts would be able to cover without investing a decent amount of capital\n\n* Extremely Memeable \u2013 I mean\u2026 GOEV, like Go\u2026 EV, idk I think it ticks off the memeability criteria\n\n* Low Liquidity \u2013 Average volume per yahoo finance is 2.7M shares, which is 2.7% of the free float so any inflow will cause the share price to move pretty significantly. Over the last quarter, it seems that institutions have been loading up on Canoo for cheap, with institutional inflows of $177M and only $2.56M sold [link](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GOEV/institutional-ownership/)\n\n* Low Risk (IV) \u2013 Yep, current IV is 77.1% for 9/24 and 10/1 options. Please do NOT consider this financial advice, like at all, but if you\u2019re one of the folks who look to just buy options for the sake of contributing to a gamma squeeze, take a look at the post by /u/ChemaKyle on how buying far OTM options and how it\u2019s not the best idea if you want the MMs to hedge. There\u2019s not much of a need to hedge vs something that doesn\u2019t have a ramp up and no OI at the ATM values. I\u2019d agree with his/her post and the commentators that buying ATM options and the underlying shares would have a greater chance at causing a gamma squeeze, but this is something you should research and do your own DD on as well based on your risk tolerance and investment threshold.\n\n**Part 8 \u2013 TL;DR**\n\nThe global EV market is expected to be valued at $725.1 Billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 27.19% from $171.26 in 2021, with total EV sales growing from 2.5 million in 2020 to 11.2 million in 2025, then reaching 31.1 million by 2030. EVs would secure approximately 32 per cent of the total market share for new car sales.  The US electric vehicles market is now expected to reach 6.9 million unit sales by 2025, up 5x from 1.4 million unit sales forecast for 2020, due to government incentives driving EV ownership. \n\nPresident Biden is seeking a pledge from auto manufacturers that would see EVs make up 40% - 50% of new U.S. vehicle sales by 2030, to support this EV tax credits jump to $12,500 in the proposed $3.5 trillion budget blueprint Democrats passed a couple of weeks ago. In August, the Senate in a non-binding amendment narrowly voted in favor of prohibiting taxpayers from claiming EV tax credits if they make more than $100,000 annually or if vehicles cost more than $40,000. Either way, this is huge for Canoo which is offering base models of the Lifestyle Vehicle and MPDV at &lt;$35,000, with the base pickup model expected to be priced similarly. \n\nCanoo aims to disrupt the current automotive model by taking a piece of the 70-80% of the portion of vehicle lifetime profit which is generated after the first owner and traditionally ignored by manufacturers. Canoo aims to change this by targeting multiple owners after the first purchase i.e. owners 2-4, offering customers the ability to upgrade the model of whichever vehicle they have or switch them entirely as the platform on which the vehicles are built is the same. Canoo is targeting the most attractive segments at a lower incremental cost. The most profitable and highest carbon dioxide emitting segments are pickups and SUVs, with $115B+ accounting for 90% of 2020 profit pool in US, and ~60% of the transportation emissions (Canoo is targeting these segments with its Lifestyle Vehicle and Pickup) and targeting one of the fastest growing segments of delivery vans, for which ~2M more delivery vehicles will be needed globally by 2030, with its MPDV.\n\nTo facilitate this disruption, Canoo has developed the world\u2019s flattest skateboard platform, which enables class-leading passenger and cargo volume on a small vehicle footprint. Canoo\u2019s Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that the company was focused on a product lineup that fits in the gaps of everybody else\u2019s lineup\u2026 take the turning radius of a Prius, the size of a Ford Ranger, Payload of F-150 and sell it as one vehicle. The use, and subsequent re-use of the skateboard platform enables significant cost savings and risk reductions, with the platform providing a strong business advantage as it is consistent across Canoo\u2019s vehicle lineup. If a project is started for a new vehicle which will have the skateboard platform as its foundation, they will be able to carryover engineer and labor, ~half, from one project to the next.\n\n* 45% - 55% labor savings for new variants developed\n\n* 57% of the BOM cost carryover across variants (compared to ~25% on ICE)\n\n* &gt;70% of critical functions are delivered by the platform.\n\nIf we take a look at the funding incentives being proposed for consumers e.g. with the LV, the maximum federal rebate would be $12,500, and if we add in state incentives e.g. Illinois with it\u2019s $4,000 rebate \u2013 that turns into $16,500. The LV is priced at $34,750 which means that post-rebates you\u2019re getting it at almost half the price, pretty ridiculous in comparison to ICE vehicles, add in tighter emissions standards for ICE vehicles and Canoo starts looking pretty good.\n\nIf you made it this far, I\u2019d like to thank you for reading this \u2013 I\u2019d like to give a big shoutout to the community over on the canoo subreddit (not sure if I can link other subs so won\u2019t). They\u2019re extremely dedicated individuals who provide a wealth of knowledge on the ongoings of the company \u2013 from driving to HQ and coincidentally finding an unrevealed product to attending EXPOs and other showcase events and sharing vehicle images and detailed write-ups. Y\u2019all the real MVPs. Position \u2013 1k shares @ 11.69.",

        "selftext": " My fellow Apes \ud83d\udc35, get ready \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude80\n\n**$BB Patent Sale update**\n\nNine months after IAM first broke the story of a potential sale of BlackBerry\u2019s patent portfolio, the deal to get it done may now be entering the endgame\n\nIt\u2019s almost exactly five months since BlackBerry confirmed in a press release about its Q4 and full year 2021 financials that the company was looking to sell a large section of its patent portfolio:\n\nDuring the quarter BlackBerry entered into an exclusive negotiation with a North American entity for the potential sale of part of the patent portfolio relating primarily to mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking. The Company has limited its patent monetization activities due to the ongoing negotiations. If the Company had not been in negotiations during the quarter, we believe that Licensing revenue would have been higher.\n\nThis came four months after IAM had broken the news that such a sale was being considered by the Canadian telecoms business.\n\nSince that March announcement, though, and the contents of a 10K release, there has been very little public or, indeed, private comment on the state of play in how the transaction negotiations are panning out.\n\nSo, while it was known that the possible deal was with a North American entity and involved that part of BlackBerry\u2019s 38,000-strong portfolio of patents \u201crelating primarily to non-core or legacy mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking technologies\u201d, there was no mention of a price, the stage the negotiations had reached or the identity of the possible buyer.\n\nInevitably, rumour finds its way into such a knowledge vacuum. Over recent months, IAM has heard all manner of things, including, most often of all, that the deal is going nowhere because the parties are so far apart on pricing; or, alternatively, that a deal is imminent and involves a single, big, Silicon Valley tech player, possibly Facebook.\n\nOur understanding, though, is that neither of these \u2013 or the many other stories doing the rounds \u2013 are correct. Instead, although parties close to the negotiations are staying tight-lipped, we believe that things are reaching a conclusion, to the extent that an agreement could be announced around the time BlackBerry releases its FY 2022 Q2 financials towards the end of September.\n\nThe pricing has been more or less agreed, and the numbers are material. Meanwhile, the buyer is actually a group of entities that have been negotiating without an intermediary. That has created a level of complexity around the deal structure which explains why it is taking so long to finalise.\n\nHowever, while there may be an announcement in the last week of next month, closure will take longer as the deal is going to require clearance from regulatory authorities in at least two countries: Canada and the US. If everything goes well, though, the sale will be signed, sealed and delivered by the end of this year.\n\nNote \u2013 the above is not definitive, it could be wrong in places. However, what IAM is confident in saying is that the deal is progressing, pricing is not an issue, the potential buyer is not a single company and the aim is to go public with an agreement on or around the day that BlackBerry announces its next set of financials towards the end of September.\n\nFamous last words!\n\n**Facebook want to use \"Blackberry Secure\" to bring WhatsApp Messenger to the Enterprise.

        "selftext": "*Disclosure: This is not financial advice and this is my personal opinion on the stock. You take full responsibility for your own action.*\n\n# Who is CrowdStrike?\n\nCrowdStrike is a cybersecurity company that provides endpoint and workload protection solutions via its Falcon cloud-based platform. The firm is referred to as the \"Salesforce of Security\" by the CEO. Crowdstrike has benefited from the \u2018work from home' trend, which has resulted in an increase in endpoint devices and burden on the cloud, making endpoint protection critical. It competes in a highly competitive market, but it has excelled by focusing on continual client acquisition and innovation. CrowdStrike has produced outstanding results and is well-positioned to develop in the market because of its great technology.\n\nCrowdStrike is a bet on the rising need for cloud-based cybersecurity solutions. The company is a global leader in endpoint security solutions, with a growing market share. The capacity of the firm to enroll major clients, cross-sell solutions, develop new product offerings, and grow its worldwide penetration is critical to its success.\n\n# CrowdStrike Leadership Management \n\nCrowdStrike was formed in 2011 by **George Kurtz, Dmitri Alperovitch, and Gregg Marston** with the goal of developing a cloud computing security solution. They proposed the idea to Warburg Pincus, a private equity firm, and received $25 million in investment. George is still the company's CEO, although Gregg resigned in 2015 and Dmitri departed in early 2020 to create a non-profit group.\n\n**George Kurtz** is the company's founder, president, and CEO. He was Chief Technical Officer of McAfee before starting CrowdStrike. George previously established Foundstone, a security firm that was eventually bought by McAfee in 2004. He has previously held key positions in the cybersecurity area at Ernst &amp; Young and PriceWaterhouseCooper. He graduated from Seton Hall University with a Science in Accounting. As of April 2020, George owned 22.4 percent of the firm.\n\nIn February 2020, **Michael Sentonas** was appointed Chief Technical officer of the business. He was formerly the company's Vice President of Technology Strategy. Prior to joining CrowdStrike, he served as McAfee's Chief Technology Officer \u2013 Security Connected and Chief Technology and Strategy Officer. He graduated from Edith Cowan University with a bachelor's degree in computer science (Australia).\n\nColin Black joined the business in 2015 and then became Chief Operating Officer in 2017. Prior to joining CrowdStrike, he was Chief investing officer of Kratos Defense and Security Solutions, Inc. and Cymer &amp; Mindspeed Technologies, Inc. He graduated from the University of Glasgow with a Science in Electronics Engineering. As of April 2020, all executive officers and directors collectively owned 11% of the firm.\n\n# CrowdStrike's Endpoint Security, IT Operations and Intelligence\n\nFalcon Prevent, Falcon Insights, Falcon Device Control, and Falcon Firewall Management are all modules in this category. These modules aid in the protection against malware and fileless assaults, as well as the real-time visibility and investigation of occurrences at client endpoints and devices. Customers may also use solutions to design, implement, and manage firewall rules and policies.\n\nFalcon OverWatch, Falcon Discover, Falcon Complete, and Falcon Spotlight are modules that handle this section. They assist clients with detecting threats, identifying rogue apps and systems, detecting real-time vulnerability across many endpoints without scanning, and combining endpoint security with repair and response capabilities. In addition, the firm offers application licensing management, Amazon Web Services expenditure analysis, and asset inventory solutions.\n\nFalcon X, Falcon Search Engine, and Falcon Sandbox are among the modules available in this market. These modules aid in the automation of threat analysis, the real-time search for malware, malware analysis, and threat research and reporting.\n\n# How does CrowdStrike make money?\n\nCustomers are paid monthly fees based on the number of endpoints and cloud modules they utilize while utilizing CrowdStrike's Falcon platform. Customers are invoiced in advance on an annual or multi-year basis, and the agreements typically last one to three years. Subscription-based revenue accounts for over 92 percent of the company's revenue, providing great revenue predictability. Professional services, which include malware analysis, incident response, forensic, proactive, and other services, account for the remaining 8%. These are non-recurring and are billed on an hourly or fixed rate basis. The company's professional services segment assists it in cross-selling its subscription-based products.\n\nCrowdStrike paid $96 million for Preempt Security in September 2020. Preempt is a Zero Trust and restricted access technology supplier that can identify and prevent attacks in real-time based on identification, behavior, and risk. This purchase would enhance the company's Zero Trust capabilities, which aid in identification and verification, enabling access to only authenticated users. Following the completion of the integration with Preempt, the firm intends to launch a new module on the Falcon platform. The United States accounts for 73% of the company's sales, Europe, Middle-East and Africa account for 14%, Asia Pacific accounts for 8%, and other areas account for the remaining 5%.\n\nTo identify and avoid potential dangers, the firm employs Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning. As more data is available to train AI, the value proposition of the products increases with increased adoption and user base. Over time, this results in a more efficient and effective platform. Furthermore, because of the platform's cloud-native architecture, security solutions may be installed fast on an endpoint in less than 30 seconds, offering prompt deployment and protection.\n\nAccording to the company's presentation, CrowdStrike has a total addressable market of $26.9 billion, which is anticipated to increase at a CAGR of 9% to $31.9 billion by 2022. The business endpoint security industry is worth $8.1 billion. The firm has a market penetration rate of less than 3%, leaving plenty of potential for expansion. The launch of new cloud modules would increase the size of the addressable market.\n\n#  Current development of the Company\n\n[WOW](https://preview.redd.it/idf5ink2b5q71.png?width=550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2c76a6199907b7f0edb2effce33784e67157f8b)\n\nCrowdStrike produced a significant topline performance as well as a bottom-line improvement in Q2 2021. It has benefited from the continuous work-from-home trend and COVID-19 shelter-in-place mandates, which have resulted in increasing workloads on the cloud and a bigger number of endpoints in an enterprise, necessitating the need for enhanced endpoint security. In fact, the business established a program to assist customers in onboarding new remote employees without jeopardizing security.\n\nOverall, it added 969 clients during the quarter, bringing the total number of consumers to 7,230, a 91 percent rise year on year. In Q2 2021, sales were $199 million, up 84 percent year on year, while subscription revenue increased by 89 percent. The subscription was $791M in Q2 2021, up 87 percent year on year. This significant growth was driven by increased client acquisition throughout the quarter, as well as the sale of additional endpoints and modules to existing customers. During the quarter, 33 percent of subscription income came from new clients, while 32 percent came from the sale of additional endpoints and modules to existing customers.\n\n# CrowdStrike's Competitors\n\nCrowdStrike works in a cutthroat business with a fast-changing technical environment. It competes with VMware Carbon Black, Trend Micro, Fortinet, McAfee Endpoint Security, Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection, Avast Advanced Endpoint Protection, and other endpoint solution providers. It also competes with antivirus solution providers such as McAfee, Kaspersky, Microsoft, and others, as well as network security companies such as Palo Alto Networks and FireEye.\n\nDespite this competitive market, the company's excellent cloud-based technology has consistently generated significant revenue growth and client acquisition. According to research, it was able to quadruple its market share in the corporate endpoint category, while the market share of the other top three competitors decreased between 2018 and 2019.\n\nCrowdStrike was the first to identify and handle the growing security demands of the cloud age, thus it benefited from being an early entrant in the area. Furthermore, its AI-powered and machine learning-enabled solutions continue to improve in terms of threat identification and breach detection, making the solutions more effective over time. At the moment, it records 3 trillion endpoint-related events every week in real-time.\n\n# CrowdStrike's Weaknesses\n\nCrowdStrike's top-line growth is amazing, but the company is still unprofitable under GAAP. Its net loss increased in fiscal 2020, decreased in fiscal 2021, then almost tripled year over year to $142.4 million in the first half of 2022. This growing deficit may be ascribed to the firm's recent acquisition of Humio, a cloud-based data logging company, its high stock-based compensation expenditures (which devoured 20% of its sales in the first half of the year), and escalating R&amp;D and marketing expenses.\n\nCrowdStrike's reliance on stock incentives has increased the number of outstanding shares since its IPO, and continuous dilution may keep its values from dropping. On the plus side, CrowdStrike's non-GAAP earnings, which remove stock-based compensation and other one-time expenditures, continue to improve. It reached non-GAAP profitability in fiscal 2021 and aims to raise non-GAAP net income by 64 percent to 86 percent this year.\n\n**TLDR**\n\n[Best Stock](https://preview.redd.it/z5jimfq8b5q71.png?width=937&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8661289be8a37483678c9b5f4df4b114d6bf9204)\n\n \n\nFull disclosure on position:\n\n15 shares @ $266.38\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zo9p1c6bb5q71.png?width=929&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f76b65f299805bff7ed3ef2dc438a98f9316f05",

        "selftext": "If you\u2019ve been following Reddit and Twitter from last week, CCJ has been one of the most talked about tickers, and rightfully so as the stock is up 60% in one month and 15% just last week. Interestingly enough, on Friday the stock price closed at the area with the most Gamma Exposure (GEX) at $25 per share.\n\nPersonally, I like Uranium as a long-term hold, but this price action deserves some paying attention to and potentially taking some profits off the table.\n\nFor those of you that don\u2019t remember or haven\u2019t read some of my other posts. Here\u2019s a description of the boxes/zones I\u2019ve overlaid on the chart.\n\n* Red Zone = FOMO area and very high-risk, high-reward play.\n* Orange Zone = The stock has normalized back a reasonable level, but is still somewhat volatile. r/R (risk/reward) is already way better than a red zone.\n* Green Zone = The stock is at a much better post-hype entry level. This area is a prime risk-to-reward when looking at a swing trade.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vn1o5yokj5n71.png?width=2402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10b78c2e46eaccdd27af17e68cf7f09d2c0afc04\n\nOf course, these zones are very easy to notice after-the-fact. Going into June CCJ would have looked to have been on a steady up-trend and buying any dips earlier this year along the way would have netted some nice returns.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019ll be keeping an eye on CCJ next week to see what happens with this squeeze or if it reverts back to the mean. Entering a new position here and chasing FOMO is extremely risky. I\u2019ll be keeping an eye on this if it goes back into the low $20\u2019s to enter another position.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet\u2019s look at my short-list of \u201cbuy the dip\u201d stocks this week.\n\n# The BTFD (Buy The F\u2019n Dip) List\n\n**Ametek (AME)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/38dkmfhlj5n71.png?width=2404&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=803267ccea4bfeade96c1570d09223ce3802b60b\n\nIf you don\u2019t know about Ametek then all you need to know is that it is a beast of a company. Strong fundamentals, strong business model, and is nicknamed the \u201cniche acquirer\u201d from their strategic list of acquisitions. AME is typically a very slow moving stock, similar to Microsoft, but if you zoom the chart out over a couple years you\u2019ll see this thing only goes up. The very small dip recently might prove to be a good entry point if you\u2019ve been waiting to get in for some time. Ex-dividend date is also tomorrow. So I would expect this to be slightly green, if the market permits, to make up for the div.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Salesforce (CRM)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ahl11f3mj5n71.png?width=2408&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4049d6c64e87d0f805682ad8fbbc9aff60e17492\n\nAnother long-term stock for my portfolio. CRM saw some tailwinds early on during Covid, but over the last 12 months the stock price has stalled. In my opinion last week\u2019s dip could be a good entry. The $250 level, which was previously resistance, might also be a good support zone to enter. Keep an eye on the 50 EMA which it was been bouncing off during this recent uptrend since May.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The MEME List\n\nThe \u201cmeme\u201d list isn\u2019t necessarily meme stocks, but it\u2019s what I refer to when I\u2019m talking about stocks that have potential to trend on social media, or they are generally higher-risk growth-stocks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Square (SQ)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2s81jromj5n71.png?width=2408&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4895c9ae388d2f7562af1729e44a6b28ad646d65\n\nSquare, which saw insane growth through Covid, has somewhat lost it\u2019s momentum. This 10% dip over the last several weeks gives it a better entry than at $275 when it was a slightly over-extended. RSI hitting over-sold and volume profile sitting right at the shelf where trading volume thins out. IMO this is a quality name to own for the long-term and although the stock is up a lot in the last 6 months, today offers a better entry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**D-Local (DLO)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jr0aanhnj5n71.png?width=2398&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8608a6c86738b337ced80d2f1ca7a817fb7ca44\n\nYou don\u2019t see this name around Reddit too much, but I think it deserves to get on most people\u2019s radar. DLO is a payment processor for Latin America, and 3rd world/emerging markets. The growth they are experiencing is over 100% YoY, which drove the stock price +30% on earnings in August. Since then it\u2019s had about a month\u2019s worth of consolidation at the $65 level. I think here at $62 provides an \u201corange box\u201d entry which I am willing to take a risk at. Ideally I would have liked to enter in the $50\u2019s, but that\u2019s what investing is all about, finding ideal risk-to-reward opportunities.",

        "selftext": "This baby boomer dividend stock might be in the ***perfect*** position to become a multi-bagger in under a year. Read on and enjoy some of my spicy *anal*ysis!\n\n* WARNING: the following is not financial advice. I had a Pepe Silvia moment and thought I'd share it with the rest of you degenerates. I am just a fellow tard ape on the internet. As of this writing, I currently own no position in $KHC; however, I will be purchasing several LEAPS for myself this week because I believe in my own research. I also believe it is more ethical to enter a position AFTER posting DD and not before, because I do not wish to be a pumper dumper. Do your own research and decide for *yourself* what to invest in. That being said, lets dive into this ~~shitty~~  kickass research.\n\n# Buffet on Buffett\n\nThat's right. The one and only 200 y/o dinosaur from Omaha and his steady 17%+ annual yielding thicc  ass bad bitch Berkshire own **325 Million** shares of $KHC. That is a whopping 26% ownership of all shares! Despite being one of the most successful investors in history, Buffett has gotten his ass absolutely handed to him by this stonk recently, yet he has been diamond handing the bag ever since he bought in during 2015. Over the last five years shares have tumbled from $90 to $36, which is a translates to a 59% drop. I do not think Buffett is wrong in his value stonk pick (as I will show below), but I do believe his timing was way off. Personally, I see this as an opportunity to get a much better price than what a mega-billionaire paid for a stock.\n\n# Heinz releases gadget to put the SQUEEZE on ketchup packets\n\nThe number one producer of ketchup sauce packets is shaking up the game with this new invention that will turn fast food on its side. On Saturday the company released a video demo of the product and claimed that *\"...this is the biggest thing to happen to sauce since packets\"*. They announced that the revolutionary product will bring more sauce for a low price of only $5.70 per unit. Be sure to check out the link for this amazing product release video!\n\nAdditionally, how many of you apes have had grilled cheese or Kraft mac n cheese before? Now ask yourself, how many times was that? If you have never stepped inside a Whole Foods before I am 100% positive you have been raised on their food products. Odds are, you have consumed hundreds of dollars of their products throughout your lifetime, now multiply that by the hundreds of millions of people who live in North America. They practically own the \"I live paycheck to paycheck\" corner of the food market. All you need is half a stick of butter and a quarter cup of milk to make a mac n cheese dinner in no time.\n\n# Shares are trading 11% below what they are actually worth\n\nAt its current share price of $36.39, $KHC has a market capitalization of $44.52B. According to their most recent earnings report, the company has $97 billion in assets and only $47 billion in liabilities. That means shareholders pay $44.52 for $50 worth of equity. The PS and PE ratios are pretty moderate (1.69 and 20.68 respectively) and the income statement is pretty static. TTM the company has over $2B in net income. It also has a dividend yield of 4.4%. This is a true value stonk, but before you skip the next part, let me tell you how this stonk has multi-bagger potential. It's safe to say $KHC will never trade at $PLTR or $CRM like multiples.\n\n# LEAPS FTW\n\nBecause $KHC is such a steady Eddie, IV is extremely low on LEAPS, which means they are much cheaper. Extreme mouth watering gains can be achieved on low IV stonks when OTM options become ITM. For example, a $40 call expiring June of 2022 currently costs you $142 per contract. If $KHC gains 30% by then, it would be possible to make 400% or more. The breakeven is $41.42, which means $KHC has to gain 13.82% for you to not lose money on this trade. In late May shares traded around $44, and have been down ever since. If shares regain what they have lost the last few months, LEAPS will be awarded handsomely. Personally, I think the rewards are well worth the risk and I will be throwing in a small portion of my meme portfolio of about 10-20% because that is what I am comfy with. I also like that this stonk seems to trade at its own beat, and since its a value play, it's not hard to imagine investors rotating out of growth and into value if the Feds money printer goes cold.\n\n#",

        "selftext": "How are my fellow Palantards not seeing C3.ai?\n\nFor anyone such as myself who likes Palantir, Snowflake and other data/AI companies, C3.ai is in a great position to be bought right now.\n\nThe company is [led by Thomas Siebel](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quickerbettertech/2020/11/19/on-crm-tom-siebel-is-back-and-hes-working-with-microsoft/?sh=5859683d341f), and while he is kind of older and approaching retirement age, you cannot overlook him. He is the man who invented CRM\u2019s, which are the software such as Salesforce and Microsoft Dynamics that drive most major corporations.\n\nWhat he is doing with this company is creating usable AI for companies, which he likes to repeatedly call \u201cturnkey solutions\u201d. Basically this means it\u2019s AI programs that simpleton operators in big companies can use without any serious coding or programming.\n\nBasically, C3.ai is doing what Palantir does, but their focus is making plug and play programs, instead of relying heavily on forward deployed engineers.\n\nOf course, what really matters here is are these empty promises and big dreams, or does the software actually work?\n\nWell the contracts and partnerships they have developed would certainly suggest that their software friggen works.\n\nThey aren\u2019t doing this work alone, they are partnered with many serious players:\n\n# CRM\u2019s:\n\nTo make AI tools that are usable with CRM\u2019s such as Salesforce and Microsoft Dynamics, they have officially partnered with **Microsoft and Adobe**. Microsoft went a step further and purchased some shares during the IPO last summer.\n\nNote, through their partnership with Microsoft, they are not competing with Salesforce, they are working with Salesforce.\n\nAnd this software is not in development, it just became available.\n\n*Partnership source:* [*https://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/26/c3-ai-microsoft-and-adobe-combine-forces-to-re-invent-crm-with-ai/*](https://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/26/c3-ai-microsoft-and-adobe-combine-forces-to-re-invent-crm-with-ai/)  \n*Launch source:* [*https://c3.ai/c3-ai-announces-general-availability-of-c3-ai-crm/*](https://c3.ai/c3-ai-announces-general-availability-of-c3-ai-crm/)\n\n# Energy:\n\nTo make AI tools that are usable in oil and gas, they partnered with **Baker Hughes**, and that software has been adopted by other oil and gas companies such as **Shell** and MEG. And obviously it works, because after their initial trial, Shell went ahead and renewed their commitment with them for 5 years.\n\n*5 year renewal source:* [*https://ir.c3.ai/news/news-details/2021/C3-AI-and-Shell-Extend-Strategic-Collaboration-to-Reshape-Global-Energy-and-Resource-Industries-with-Enterprise-AI/default.aspx*](https://ir.c3.ai/news/news-details/2021/C3-AI-and-Shell-Extend-Strategic-Collaboration-to-Reshape-Global-Energy-and-Resource-Industries-with-Enterprise-AI/default.aspx)\n\n# National Defense:\n\nTo make national defense tools, they are working with both the US Air Force, and the Missile Defence Agency, to create AI tools used for diagnostics on aircraft, and ballistics for a missile defence system.\n\nNote, the Missile Defence Agency has the ambitious goal of creating an advanced system that would protect USA from airborne missile attacks. Basically, they are trying to create an iron dome comparable to what Israel is using to defend itself from Palestinian terrorists.\n\n*MDA source:* [*https://c3.ai/c3-ai-to-enable-ambitious-sustainability-and-energy-efficiency-goals-with-aluminium-beverage-packaging-category-leader/*](https://c3.ai/c3-ai-to-enable-ambitious-sustainability-and-energy-efficiency-goals-with-aluminium-beverage-packaging-category-leader/)\n\n# Autonomous Packaging:\n\nNow today, they just announced that they have expanded into technology that will obviously be useful in ALL retail. They just signed a deal to help develop autonomous packaging with one of the largest aluminum packaging companies in the world, Ball Corporation, who does $12B in annual revenue at 60 international locations.\n\n*Ball Corporation source:* [*https://c3.ai/c3-ai-to-enable-ambitious-sustainability-and-energy-efficiency-goals-with-aluminium-beverage-packaging-category-leader/*](https://c3.ai/c3-ai-to-enable-ambitious-sustainability-and-energy-efficiency-goals-with-aluminium-beverage-packaging-category-leader/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Cloud Computing:\n\nC3.ai\u2019s products are now being carried by both **Google Cloud and Snowflake**. Both of those companies are offering C3.ai\u2019s products to their customers to work with their platforms, and both of those companies have an incentive to help sell the product. Google Cloud\u2019s CEO has done a TV interview with C3, stating that they intend to use Google Clouds 2000 person sales team to get people using C3 on google servers.\n\n*Google source:* [*https://c3.ai/google-cloud-and-c3-ai-create-industry-first-alliance-to-accelerate-enterprise-ai/*](https://c3.ai/google-cloud-and-c3-ai-create-industry-first-alliance-to-accelerate-enterprise-ai/)\n\n*Snowflake source:* [*https://c3.ai/c3-ai-and-snowflake-partner-to-deliver-next-generation-enterprise-ai-applications-at-scale/*](https://c3.ai/c3-ai-and-snowflake-partner-to-deliver-next-generation-enterprise-ai-applications-at-scale/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the question is this if these companies and organizations see value in C3\u2019s software, why the hell is it valued so much lower than Palantir and Snowflake:\n\n* Microsoft\n* Google\n* Adobe\n* Shell\n* Baker Hughes\n* US Air Force\n* Missile Defence Agency\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Some key fundamental facts:**\n\n* The stock is down 75% from it\u2019s meme mania highs, and looks like it has technically bottomed out.\n* They have $1B of cash on hand, with like a $37M burn rate. They have LOTS of runway.\n* They are actually \u201cstructurally profitable\u201d meaning they have a large margin on their cost of goods sold, but their loss is directly attributable to the money being spent on marketing and sales, which the CEO rightly defends as a smart investment.\n* YOY revenue is up 29% in the last quarter.\n* They operate in the large customer space like Palantir, and their enterprise AI customers grew 85% to 98 in the last quarter. With the recent announcements, they are likely over 100 now.\n\nSource: [https://ir.c3.ai/financials/quarterly-results/default.aspx](https://ir.c3.ai/financials/quarterly-results/default.aspx)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\---\n\n# TLDR: If you like Palantir, you should probably be interested in C3.ai as well.",

        "selftext": " If you\u2019re looking for a deSpac, gamma squeeze, short squeeze, ketchup squeeze, or memelord stock, this isn\u2019t it. So we will see if the mods even allow this.   \nI thought to myself the other day about \u201capex\u201d companies. These are the companies that are far and away the leading companies in their space. For example:  \nSocial Media: Facebook  \nOnline Shopping (and cloud..): Amazon  \nSearch: Google  \nSmartphones: Apple  \nEV cars: Tesla  \n\n\nYou get the idea. But what I was moderately surprised at was the **lack of social media** **marketing** company. When a company is scheduling things to advertise on Instagram, responding to your whining on Twitter, or answering customer queries via Whatsapp, what are they using? **If you\u2019re a top company, they\u2019re using Sprinklr.** \n\nGo look for yourself. What\u2019s Amazon\u2019s Twitter using? What\u2019s Google\u2019s Twitter using? What\u2019s ESPN (Disney) using?  \nOther examples of companies that use Sprinklr (as of Q2):  \nNetflix  \nMicrosoft  \nTwitter  \nAmazon\n\nGoogle  \nThe Marines (yep, it\u2019s been government-certified)  \nTSA  \nAccenture\n\nDeloitte  \nMcDonalds (tendies)  \nIf you work at a big company, you\u2019ll recognize there are a lot of disparate tools being used in a similar function. Social Media management is no different. At its simplest, Sprinklr allows companies to organize content across platforms, easily respond to customers through different channels, and analyze the outcomes. This is exceedingly valuable to companies in order to manage their social media (helping with marketing efficiency, customer service outcomes, social listening, etc.) There are also much deeper integrations here as well, but we will start with that.  \nNow, how much do you think a company would be worth, given that the majority of the Fortune 100 uses their services? What if I told you they had 74+ customers generating over $1M each on a yearly basis? What if I said they had about 1000 other customers, with average subscription revenue (yearly) of $350K each?  \nWell, whatever you had in your head - the current market cap of Sprinklr is roughly $4.3BN. By EoY, they\u2019re expecting (their prediction from Q2 earnings) to generate \\~$415M in revenue (22% growth YoY).   \nHowever, I believe it\u2019s generally undervalued for a variety of reasons.  \n1) They are recognizing revenue from subscriptions (90% of their revenue) as it happens, not when the deals are signed. I believe their estimates to be really low. Consider that there are 74 customers with at least $1M in yearly subscription revenue, and they themselves have stated they have 1000 customers with an average yearly value of $350K (as of June 23). Well, if you just took the average value X 1000 customers, + $74M, you\u2019re already at $424M revenue. And no doubt, there are more customers signed since June, and no doubt some of the 74 \u201cbig\u201d customers are spending much more than $1M annually. They also have the opportunity to upsell their current customers. **TL;DR** they\u2019re clearly going to be way ahead of their projected earnings and will continually revise earnings skyward.  \n2) This is a really sticky industry. The companies that put the amount of work to migrate to use Sprinklr aren\u2019t going to change to a different provider easily (and frankly, a single competitor doesn\u2019t really exist). Retention is likely to be extremely high.  \n3) Sprinklr is **really early**. The fact that they have the majority of the biggest companies on the planet signed bodes well for their future. They have now stated they\u2019re targeting the next biggest 30000 companies, and their sales pipeline/staff has started to ramp up (paused all of last year). I would expect many more companies to be signed here; additionally, I expect additional products to be released that can be upsold to existing customers (live chat analysis, liter-research platforms - they just announced something like this called Modern Research Lite - etc.)\n\nAnyway, I could say a lot more, but by this point I either have your interest or not. A few things to conclude with - \n\n1. Look at companies in an adjacent space to them. Qualtrics (survey + experience management company) - $23BN. Zendesk (mainly customer support/comms) - $14.5BN. Liveperson (a stock that literally just does chat on a website) - $4.7BN. Take any comp you want - probably undervalued.\n2. Sprinklr does have a competitor called **Sprout Social**. Sprout is awesome too, and much more targeted at small companies. I\u2019m invested in Sprout as well; they\u2019ve been on a rocketship recently ($7.3BN cap with $132M in yearly rev). However, I like Sprinklr over Sprout for a variety of reasons.. But the main one? **Trust what the top companies on Earth are using**. And I will take their judgment on this one. There\u2019s probably room for both to succeed, but Sprout is much more narrow in my mind.\n3. All wall street analyst PTs are above current price, with the lowest at $21 and the highest at $29.\n4. There is basically **zero** ETF ownership of this, which is absurd as Sprout has **60** ETFS that contain it. I would be shocked if ETFs didn\u2019t start picking this up, which will likely lead to a quick upswing in price because the amount of outstanding shares is quite low (high amount of institutional shares held, but can\u2019t be sold).\n   1. This has led to volatility recently (5-7% up and down days), but it doesn\u2019t seem to be reflected in options pricing as IV is \\~60-70%. Options not a bad idea.  \n\n\nTL;DR Sprinklr is undervalued. Massive opportunity. I think it could be the \u201cSalesforce of Social Media Management\u201d. Position = 2600 shares and 38 Feb 20 calls.   \n\n\nFortune 100 stat: [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210907005026/en/Sprinklr-to-Present-at-Upcoming-Investor-Conference](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210907005026/en/Sprinklr-to-Present-at-Upcoming-Investor-Conference)   \nCompanies used (1): [https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/09/17/sprinklr-inc-cxm-q2-2022-earnings-call-transcript/](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/09/17/sprinklr-inc-cxm-q2-2022-earnings-call-transcript/)   \nCompanies used (2):  \n[https://www.sprinklr.com/stories/](https://www.sprinklr.com/stories/) \n\nMarket cap: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CXM?p=CXM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CXM?p=CXM)  \nInvestor deck: [https://investors.sprinklr.com/](https://investors.sprinklr.com/)",

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, September 17, 2021**\n\nStocks declined today, reversing from yesterday\u2019s gain given today was a quadruple witching event and market participants continue to digest a slew of new economic data and the potential implications for monetary policy. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 0.97% down, the Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 1.19% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.53% down. As of today\u2019s close, September is headed for its first negative month all year.\n\nToday was the quarterly quadruple witching, an event wherein individual stock options and futures, and index options and futures, all expire the same day. Typically, this event has elevated volume and volatility on the day and days leading up to it. Definitely one of the reasons for today\u2019s decline. \n\nWith the coronavirus Delta variant fanning fears of a slowdown in growth in the US and China, market participants have been carefully weighing incoming economic data. In the US, August retail sales showed an unexpected rise despite the latest surge of coronavirus Delta variant cases. The Commerce Department's August retail sales report showed overall sales rose by 0.7% on the month after a downwardly revised 1.8% drop in July. Consensus economists were looking for a 0.7% drop. \n\nA few days ago, China\u2019s retail sales report showed a dramatic slowdown in growth as the country battles rising coronavirus cases and seasonal floodings, with output and sales reaching a one-year low. Consumer spending grew 2.5% in the month of August, a sharp deceleration from the 8.5% growth in July and missing estimates of 7% growth. Industrial production rose 5.3% in August from a year earlier, narrowing from an increase of 6.4% in July and marking the weakest pace since July 2020, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday. Output growth missed the 5.8% increase tipped by analysts.\n\nAll the recent data will factor into the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest assessment of the economy, which is set to be released next week via the meeting minutes. Market participants are anxiously waiting to see if the incoming meeting minutes have a signal regarding the timing to announce plans to begin tapering the pace of quantitative easing. \n\nMark Luschini, Chief Investment Strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, said \u201cI think it\u2019s really a tug of war at the moment that is underway, which is to say, there\u2019s still good news on the economy. In fact, in the last two days, we've gotten some good regional Fed survey reports and today's retail sales number. But at the same time, it's in the context of this overall deceleration of growth we've seen so far in the third quarter \\[and\\] worries about the Delta variant.\u201d\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* According to the University of Michigan\u2019s closely watched consumer sentiment survey, sentiment improved only slightly in September after reaching its lowest level since 2011 in August. The headline index in the institution's Surveys of Consumers ticked up to 71.0 in the preliminary reading, compared to the 70.3 posted in August. Consensus economists were looking for the index to improve to 72.0 in September.\n* Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc will give a one-time bonus of $1,250 to its full-time pharmacists and a $1,000 payment to part-time pharmacists, the drugstore chain said on Friday, as major retailers try to retain people amid intense labor shortages. This is a similar effort other retailers have employed.\n* Irish regulators raised privacy concerns regarding Facebook\u2019s (FB) new smart glasses. The concern comes that people have a difficult timing  telling whether the glasses are filming or not\n* Tencent (TCEHY) opens WeChat, the super app with more than $1 billion users, to allows rivals to display their links. This comes after Chinese regulators banned the practice of Chinese tech companies banning links to rivals within their platforms\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Agilent Technologies (A) target raised by Cowen from $!65 to $200 at Outperform. Stock currently around $174\n* Salesforce (CRM) target raised by Barclays from $320 to $330 at Overweight.

        "selftext": "*Disclosure: This is not financial advice and this is my personal opinion on the stock. You take full responsibility for your own action.*\n\n# Who is CrowdStrike?\n\nCrowdStrike is a cybersecurity company that provides endpoint and workload protection solutions via its Falcon cloud-based platform. The firm is referred to as the \"Salesforce of Security\" by the CEO. Crowdstrike has benefited from the \u2018work from home' trend, which has resulted in an increase in endpoint devices and burden on the cloud, making endpoint protection critical. It competes in a highly competitive market, but it has excelled by focusing on continual client acquisition and innovation. CrowdStrike has produced outstanding results and is well-positioned to develop in the market because of its great technology.\n\nCrowdStrike is a bet on the rising need for cloud-based cybersecurity solutions. The company is a global leader in endpoint security solutions, with a growing market share. The capacity of the firm to enroll major clients, cross-sell solutions, develop new product offerings, and grow its worldwide penetration is critical to its success.\n\n# CrowdStrike Leadership Management\n\nCrowdStrike was formed in 2011 by **George Kurtz, Dmitri Alperovitch, and Gregg Marston** with the goal of developing a cloud computing security solution. They proposed the idea to Warburg Pincus, a private equity firm, and received $25 million in investment. George is still the company's CEO, although Gregg resigned in 2015 and Dmitri departed in early 2020 to create a non-profit group.\n\n**George Kurtz** is the company's founder, president, and CEO. He was Chief Technical Officer of McAfee before starting CrowdStrike. George previously established Foundstone, a security firm that was eventually bought by McAfee in 2004. He has previously held key positions in the cybersecurity area at Ernst &amp; Young and PriceWaterhouseCooper. He graduated from Seton Hall University with a Science in Accounting. As of April 2020, George owned 22.4 percent of the firm.\n\nIn February 2020, **Michael Sentonas** was appointed Chief Technical officer of the business. He was formerly the company's Vice President of Technology Strategy. Prior to joining CrowdStrike, he served as McAfee's Chief Technology Officer \u2013 Security Connected and Chief Technology and Strategy Officer. He graduated from Edith Cowan University with a bachelor's degree in computer science (Australia).\n\nColin Black joined the business in 2015 and then became Chief Operating Officer in 2017. Prior to joining CrowdStrike, he was Chief investing officer of Kratos Defense and Security Solutions, Inc. and Cymer &amp; Mindspeed Technologies, Inc. He graduated from the University of Glasgow with a Science in Electronics Engineering. As of April 2020, all executive officers and directors collectively owned 11% of the firm.\n\n# CrowdStrike's Endpoint Security, IT Operations and Intelligence\n\nFalcon Prevent, Falcon Insights, Falcon Device Control, and Falcon Firewall Management are all modules in this category. These modules aid in the protection against malware and fileless assaults, as well as the real-time visibility and investigation of occurrences at client endpoints and devices. Customers may also use solutions to design, implement, and manage firewall rules and policies.\n\nFalcon OverWatch, Falcon Discover, Falcon Complete, and Falcon Spotlight are modules that handle this section. They assist clients with detecting threats, identifying rogue apps and systems, detecting real-time vulnerability across many endpoints without scanning, and combining endpoint security with repair and response capabilities. In addition, the firm offers application licensing management, Amazon Web Services expenditure analysis, and asset inventory solutions.\n\nFalcon X, Falcon Search Engine, and Falcon Sandbox are among the modules available in this market. These modules aid in the automation of threat analysis, the real-time search for malware, malware analysis, and threat research and reporting.\n\n# How does CrowdStrike make money?\n\nCustomers are paid monthly fees based on the number of endpoints and cloud modules they utilize while utilizing CrowdStrike's Falcon platform. Customers are invoiced in advance on an annual or multi-year basis, and the agreements typically last one to three years. Subscription-based revenue accounts for over 92 percent of the company's revenue, providing great revenue predictability. Professional services, which include malware analysis, incident response, forensic, proactive, and other services, account for the remaining 8%. These are non-recurring and are billed on an hourly or fixed rate basis. The company's professional services segment assists it in cross-selling its subscription-based products.\n\nCrowdStrike paid $96 million for Preempt Security in September 2020. Preempt is a Zero Trust and restricted access technology supplier that can identify and prevent attacks in real-time based on identification, behavior, and risk. This purchase would enhance the company's Zero Trust capabilities, which aid in identification and verification, enabling access to only authenticated users. Following the completion of the integration with Preempt, the firm intends to launch a new module on the Falcon platform. The United States accounts for 73% of the company's sales, Europe, Middle-East and Africa account for 14%, Asia Pacific accounts for 8%, and other areas account for the remaining 5%.\n\nTo identify and avoid potential dangers, the firm employs Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning. As more data is available to train AI, the value proposition of the products increases with increased adoption and user base. Over time, this results in a more efficient and effective platform. Furthermore, because of the platform's cloud-native architecture, security solutions may be installed fast on an endpoint in less than 30 seconds, offering prompt deployment and protection.\n\nAccording to the company's presentation, CrowdStrike has a total addressable market of $26.9 billion, which is anticipated to increase at a CAGR of 9% to $31.9 billion by 2022. The business endpoint security industry is worth $8.1 billion. The firm has a market penetration rate of less than 3%, leaving plenty of potential for expansion. The launch of new cloud modules would increase the size of the addressable market.\n\n# Current development of the Company\n\nCrowdStrike produced a significant topline performance as well as a bottom-line improvement in Q2 2021. It has benefited from the continuous work-from-home trend and COVID-19 shelter-in-place mandates, which have resulted in increasing workloads on the cloud and a bigger number of endpoints in an enterprise, necessitating the need for enhanced endpoint security. In fact, the business established a program to assist customers in onboarding new remote employees without jeopardizing security.\n\nOverall, it added 969 clients during the quarter, bringing the total number of consumers to 7,230, a 91 percent rise year on year. In Q2 2021, sales were $199 million, up 84 percent year on year, while subscription revenue increased by 89 percent. The subscription was $791M in Q2 2021, up 87 percent year on year. This significant growth was driven by increased client acquisition throughout the quarter, as well as the sale of additional endpoints and modules to existing customers. During the quarter, 33 percent of subscription income came from new clients, while 32 percent came from the sale of additional endpoints and modules to existing customers.\n\n# CrowdStrike's Competitors\n\nCrowdStrike works in a cutthroat business with a fast-changing technical environment. It competes with VMware Carbon Black, Trend Micro, Fortinet, McAfee Endpoint Security, Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection, Avast Advanced Endpoint Protection, and other endpoint solution providers. It also competes with antivirus solution providers such as McAfee, Kaspersky, Microsoft, and others, as well as network security companies such as Palo Alto Networks and FireEye.\n\nDespite this competitive market, the company's excellent cloud-based technology has consistently generated significant revenue growth and client acquisition. According to research, it was able to quadruple its market share in the corporate endpoint category, while the market share of the other top three competitors decreased between 2018 and 2019.\n\nCrowdStrike was the first to identify and handle the growing security demands of the cloud age, thus it benefited from being an early entrant in the area. Furthermore, its AI-powered and machine learning-enabled solutions continue to improve in terms of threat identification and breach detection, making the solutions more effective over time. At the moment, it records 3 trillion endpoint-related events every week in real-time.\n\n# CrowdStrike's Weaknesses\n\nCrowdStrike's top-line growth is amazing, but the company is still unprofitable under GAAP. Its net loss increased in fiscal 2020, decreased in fiscal 2021, then almost tripled year over year to $142.4 million in the first half of 2022. This growing deficit may be ascribed to the firm's recent acquisition of Humio, a cloud-based data logging company, its high stock-based compensation expenditures (which devoured 20% of its sales in the first half of the year), and escalating R&amp;D and marketing expenses.\n\nCrowdStrike's reliance on stock incentives has increased the number of outstanding shares since its IPO, and continuous dilution may keep its values from dropping. On the plus side, CrowdStrike's non-GAAP earnings, which remove stock-based compensation and other one-time expenditures, continue to improve. It reached non-GAAP profitability in fiscal 2021 and aims to raise non-GAAP net income by 64 percent to 86 percent this year.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nBest Stock\n\nFull disclosure on position:\n\n15 shares @ $266.38",

        "selftext": "***\"Can I Defend This Trade?\"***\n\nSeems like a very basic question, right?  If another trader asked you why you took the trade, can you defend your position?  \n\nIf your defense is not based in any form of analysis, the answer is - no.   \n\nSo many traders lose money consistently because they are constantly trying to anticipate a move before waiting for confirmation.  Guessing at bottoms and tops, attempting to 'stay ahead of the market', and wanting to capture a move from the very beginning are some of the top reasons why new traders wind up in red.  Asking yourself this question before making a trade will help you filter out these *gut* decisions.\n\nLet's say you bought calls on **ZM** at the close of market on Friday, and when asked why, your answer is, \"I think it has hit bottom, it has to start reversing soon\" - *that is not a defense.*\n\nOr perhaps you bought puts on **CRM** at the close of market on Friday, with the defense of, \"It think it will pullback on Monday\" - *once again, that is not a defense.*\n\n**Defensible trades are ones that you can offer clear analysis that support your decision.**  \n\nIt doesn't mean your trade will work, but it does mean that you had understandable reasons for the making the play you did.  \n\nFor example - on Friday I made the following trade, which I am still holding:  \n\nPut Debit Spread, expiring on 10/1 for **AMZN** where I bought the 3400 Puts and sold the 3350 Puts.  This costs me a debit of $16.25.\n\nHere is my defense - \n\n1) I am getting a 68% ROI on this trade, with $33.75 per contract of upside - meaning, if I am right more than 35% of the time, this trade is profitable.\n\n2) **AMZN** has been weak to the market on a daily basis.  **SPY** has filled the gap from its' drop on 9/20, while **AMZN** has not.\n\n3) **AMZN** is struggling to stay above its' SMA 50 right now, with low volume these past three days (compared to the high Relative Volume when it dropped).\n\n4) My bias on the market is somewhat bearish - while **SPY** has filled the gap, selling pressure remains strong and it has not been able to rebound as previous patterns on the ETF suggested it might.\n\n5) The rest of my portfolio is somewhat bullish, and given my slight bearish bias on the market, the **AMZN** trade acts as a strong hedge for me as well. \n\n6) If **AMZN** manages to say above it's SMA 50 I still have some time close the trade for a loss, but not max loss.\n\nAdmittedly this is a riskier trade than what I usually do - but it is still *defensible.* \n\nThere are also many arguments *against* this trade as well - **AMZN** has shown a HA reversal on the daily chart, it closed above its' SMA 50, with an ATR of 60 it could move up significantly on Monday and thus leaving me with little chance to close the trade without taking a huge loss.  Just because there are arguments against a trade, does not mean it is not *defensible*. \n\nGo through your trades in the past week/month and ask yourself, could I have defended this trade?  Be honest about it, and just mark the trades you could have defended with a Y and the ones you couldn't with a N.  Now look at the profit/loss for the trades marked with a Y vs. those with a N.  I absolutely guarantee that you performed significantly better on the trades you could defend.\n\nWhile there are many different things one should do in order to be a successful trader, just asking yourself this question before making a trade will save you a significant amount of losing positions.  It is a very simply litmus test, and quick to apply.   \n\nBest - H.S.",

        "selftext": "We know software/newer tech sort of follows the Amazon playbook of growth at all costs without showing profits till later, so we can start by valuing it at price to sales.  Salesforce was always sort of a wall street hype stock, when they hit a $100B market cap around 06/2018, they had $11B in annual Rev and $3.6B per quarter for a 8 price to sales.  In fact in all their years public they never really broke through a 11 p/s ratio and to their credit, like ADBE, AMZN and other successful companies they actually grew into their valuations.\n\nSNOW is almost at $100B with $270 mil per quarter.  Price to sales is around 100.  See the problem?\n\nOthers:\n\nBILL - $28B market - 110 p/s\n\nDDOG - $44B market - 55 p/s\n\nZS - $37B - 60 p/s\n\nOKTA - $39B - 33 p/s\n\nCRWD, COUP, SHOP, MDB, DOCU, DOCS, NET, MNDY, TEAM, U, etc\n\nThere are plenty more.. Zoom peaked in Oct of 2020 at a \\~70 p/s and has been on a downslide since then. \n\nI think we\u2019re a quarter of two away from a major crash in software. The pump can\u2019t go on forever.  \n\nBuyer beware, if you\u2019re short, hang in there!",

        "selftext": "Not a traditional LOI on a stock, but I dived deep enough in this to call it a DD.\n\n# Press release, shortly:\n\nXigem Technologies Corporation (CSE: XIGM) (OTCQB: XIGMF) (FSE: 2C1) has entered into a letter of intent to acquire up to 22% of the common shares of iDealer, a transportation management technology provider for automobile dealers and other fleet operators. The transaction is valued at up to $874,896. In addition, Xigem will appoint a representative to the iDealer board of directors.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xigem-technologies-grows-technology-portfolio-060000691.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xigem-technologies-grows-technology-portfolio-060000691.html)\n\nIn other words, Xigem now has another company in its portfolio for the remote economy.\n\n# Now what is iDealer?\n\nAccording to the press release, iDealer is a **SaaS-based transportation, dispatch and routing management system which is built on a proprietary artificial intelligence technology.**\u00a0\n\nSounds complicated and shady. I get suspicious every time I see something-something-unique-AI, it went too mainstream in the last few years.\n\n**This is what iDealer actually is, in simple words:**\n\nit\u2019s a paid software for businesses that have to operate big fleets of cars, mainly car dealerships, valet services, delivery companies and so on.\n\n**Example (just how I get it):** Say, you run a big car parts shop and you constantly need to track all your cars, parts, delivery vans, drivers, and so on. You can play games with your mental health and try to keep it all in your head. You can pay an extra salary to a team of managers t keep it on paper. You can abuse Excel and Google maps. Or you can get iDealer (or a similar software, it\u2019s a highly competitive market).\n\niDealer puts it all in one place so you can see where exactly every driver or vehicle is, all LIVE, what are they doing and when they\u2019ll get to the destination. You can talk to them, give them new tasks, and so on. \n\n**AI is used on the driver\u2019s side, it builds an optimal route so they can get from point A to point B faster, navigating around traffic.**\n\nCustomers (dealers or those who, say, wait for the delivery) have to wait less, car fleet operators track everything easily and save on gas.\n\n[Their graphics on how AI is supposed to work](https://preview.redd.it/o4yrc2iaioo71.png?width=702&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0f147c95af0910ed2c1f74938103b73b958f50b)\n\n# Some info on iDealer\n\nOfficially, they call it a \u00abValet, Parts and Shuttle Management System\u00bb\n\nIt was founded in 2018;\n\nIt\u2019s estimated revenue is 1.3M per year with no debt (source: [https://growjo.com/company/iDEALER\\_INC](https://growjo.com/company/iDEALER_INC))\n\nThey have a team of 4, I guess not much people needed to support a working app)\n\nFor clients \u2014\u00a0iDealer guarantees 9x ROI at a minimum to dealerships of any size.\n\nThey work with:\n\n* McManes Automotive;\n* Prestige Auto Group;\n* Dilawri;\n* AutoCanada;\n* Wood Automotive Group;\n* Alpha Auto Group\n* Also \u2014 iDealer is \u00abimplemented at dealerships representing every major automobile brand\u00bb (from the press release)\n\nThe main list is from their website: [https://idealer.io/](https://idealer.io/)\n\nAlso, they partnered with $UBER to use their fleet on high demand.\n\nLinkedIn seems to be active [https://www.linkedin.com/company/idealer/](https://www.linkedin.com/company/idealer/)\n\niDealer\u2019s CEO Sergey Nekipelov\u2019s past projects are looking alive as well, no shady name changes:\n\n* Founding Partner, CEO at\u00a0iDEALER INC.\u00a0(Calgary, Alberta, Canada)Jan 2018 - Current\n* Founding Partner, President at\u00a0[Tallium Inc.\u00a0](https://www.signalhire.com/companies/tallium-inc)(Calgary, Alberta, Canada)Jan 2014 - Current [https://tallium.com/](https://tallium.com/) (web development, they\u2019ve made all the visuals for iDealer)\n* Founding Partner at\u00a08Wines\u00a0(Praha, Praha, Czech Republic)Jun 2016 - Current[https://8wines.com/](https://8wines.com/)\n* Ex-owner &amp; CEO at\u00a0DesignContest\u00aeApr 2010 - Dec 2019\n* Sr Project Manager at\u00a0Ecobiofuel IncJan 2003 - Jan 2005\n\n(Source: [https://www.signalhire.com/profiles/sergey-nekipelov%27s-email/13711515](https://www.signalhire.com/profiles/sergey-nekipelov%27s-email/13711515))\n\nBtw in the press release he said that the money from selling 22% of the company to Xigem will go into the iDealer growth:\n\n&gt;\u00abWe will invest this capital into the further development and commercialization of our technology\u00bb.\n\nSource: the press release \n\n# A little on the car dealers market\n\n(TLDR: It grows and is expected to get to 1 Trillion USD by the end of 2021)\n\nNew Car Dealers in the US Market Size in 2021 \u2014\u00a0**1 Tr (by revenue)**\n\n**17,563 New Car Dealers**\u00a0businesses in the US (as of 2021)\n\nNew Car Dealers in the US Market Size Growth in 2021 \u2014\u00a0**10.6%**\n\n**Sources:**\n\n* **IBIS** [**https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/new-car-dealers-united-states/**](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/new-car-dealers-united-states/)\n* **and McKinsey** [**https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/as-dramatic-disruption-comes-to-automotive-showrooms-proactive-dealers-can-benefit-greatly**](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/as-dramatic-disruption-comes-to-automotive-showrooms-proactive-dealers-can-benefit-greatly)\n\n# Some worries:\n\n* It\u2019s a highly competitive niche, with CDK Global, VinSolutions, Elead and DealerSocket close to iDealer in terms of service options. None of them have AI, but some are notably bigger;\n* I see no hints about iDealer and iAgent (Xigem\u2019s flagship one-stop-shop software) merging or integrations. Same for FOOi (Xigem\u2019s fully-owned P2P payment system). iAgent and iDealer \u2014 the deal would look perfect, but maybe it\u2019s in the future plans. So far XIgem just buys 22% of iDealer and that\u2019s it; \n* The deal is in LOI, the Transaction is expected to close by December 31, 2021 \u00absubject to the completion of due diligence, the execution of definitive agreements and the receipt of any regulatory approvals\u00bb. \n\n# Now Xigem\u2019s portfolio looks like this:\n\n* iDealer \u2014\u00a022%, $874k\n* FOOi (100%, P2P payment system) \u2014\u00a0$500k\n* FBLabs (lead generation for hotel chains like Fairmont and Swissotel) \u2014 $750k\n\nAnd their own things in development:\n\niAgent aka Xigem Platform (paid one-stop-shop for business remote operations, CRM for small and medium enterprises) \u2014\u00a0in development, approaching alpha testing;\n\niAgent customizable version \u2014\u00a0signed to work with clients:\n\n* Baketree\n* FluBusters\n* and Insurance Supermarket.\n\n**Revenue expected in Q3 and Q4 2021**\n\n# Xigem Q2 results:\n\n* $1.5 million of cash;\n* Approximately $2.9 million of assets;\n* Approximately $470 thousand of current liabilities;\n* No long-term debt.\n\nSource: [https://www.xigemtechnologies.com/xigem-technologies-announces-results-for-q2-2021/](https://www.xigemtechnologies.com/xigem-technologies-announces-results-for-q2-2021/)\n\n# TLDR:\n\nXigem Technologies (aka $XIGM) invested $874k in an iDealer \u00ablast mile\u00bb service. They provide all kinds of live monitoring for car dealerships, delivery companies and valet services. The company generates about 1.3 Mil annual revenue, partnered with Uber and major auto brands. The company looks promising, the 1 Trillion market is growing, and now Xigem signed an agreement to get 22% of them. Overall \u2014 a good new LOI.\n\n# P.S.\n\nDon\u2019t mistake iDealer from USA and Australia with an iDealer app from Malaysia \u2014 I spent more time researching a car dealership app for a Malaysian version of autotrader than it was worth it. I\u2019m never getting this time back. Anyway, if you\u2019re in Malaysia \u2014\u00a0their iDealer looks good as well.",

        "selftext": "In April 2020, ecommerce spending exploded globally. In 8 short weeks, US ecommerce spending as a % of total retail sales grew from 16% to 27%. $SHOP and $AMZN have seen their TAM grow massively and their valuations have grown to reflect this.\n\nWhat if I told you something very similar is happening right now in enterprise SaaS?\n\nAmazingly, in 2020, cloud/SaaS spending is still only 9.1% of total global IT spend. But this in changing. Spending on  cloud/SaaS is expected to grow by 18.4% in 2021 alone.\n\nMuch in the same way that the pandemic has made ecommerce a core part of any retail company\u2019s strategy, it has made SaaS a core part of every company\u2019s plans.\n\nOn-premise software just doesn\u2019t make sense in a remote-first world.\n\nJust like Amazon and Shopify have benefited from the eccommerce explosion, companies like $WDAY, $CRM, $MSFT and $OKTA will benefit from the SaaS explosion.\n\nRead more here: https://tadhg.substack.com/p/the-saas-market-opportunity-is-way",

        "selftext": "Gather around folks, hope y\u2019all made some gains the last time around. This DD Is split into 8 parts, so feel free to jump to whichever section you\u2019re most interested in.\n\n**Part 1 \u2013 Introduction**\n\n**Part 2 \u2013 Market Trends and Upcoming Catalysts**\n\n**Part 3 \u2013 Company Overview and Unique Value Proposition**\n\n**Part 4 \u2013 Recent Updates**\n\n**Part 5 \u2013 Financials and Valuation**\n\n**Part 6 \u2013 Bear Case**\n\n**Part 7 \u2013 SI and Squeeze Potential**\n\n**Part 8 \u2013 TL;DR**\n\n**Part 1 \u2013 Introduction**\n\nIt was a warm Monday morning on August 23rd almost a month back, when seemingly for no reason \u2013 **GOEV shot up from ~$5.9 to ~$8, a 30% gain on the day.** The next day \u2013 GME popped, for a 30% gain as well, with AMC and BB also making up big gains, leading to the \u2018meme mania\u2019 we\u2019ve been experiencing for the last couple of weeks. \n\nWhy\u2019d this happen? Well there were no company/industry catalysts. The only event that seemed to occur in the prior week was the expiration of monthly options. One of the theories going around is that there\u2019s an almost quarterly cycle going on at this point where FTD\u2019s are leading to a surge in prices in the next cycle for \u2018meme stocks\u2019 which tend to be heavily shorted for the most part. How accurate this is I have no clue and whether this applies to GOEV I don\u2019t know, haven\u2019t investigated that particular theory but there\u2019s plenty of posts/comments floating around for you to look into if you\u2019re so inclined. \n\nThe quick point I\u2019m trying to make here is that if a heavily shorted stock is popping 30% in a day, with no major catalyst for the industry or the company in question \u2013 and that company is now advancing towards realizing its major milestones with favorable tailwinds expected for the sector, it could pop a lot more than 30% in the months to come. **GOEV is among the youngest EV companies - having been around for less than 5 years, with arguably the most unique vehicles coming out (on schedule \u2013 seems to be pretty amazing in the EV space) that very few, if any, of the established or other up and coming competitors are producing, and has been shorted more it seems \u2013 for the failure of its peers than any real fault of its own.**\n\n**Part 2 \u2013 Market Trends and Upcoming Catalysts**\n\n* From an investment into equities point of view \u2013 S&amp;P 500 has fallen about 0.5%, on average, during the month of September. Stocks have tended to go up, on average, during every other month \u2014 other than a slight dip in February \u2014 over the past half century [link]( https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/01/investing/stock-market-september/index.html). However, this may soon be coming to an end as in the past week Investors stampeded into stocks and out of cash as global equity funds witnessed their biggest inflows since March 2021 while large-cap U.S. funds enjoyed a record haul, a weekly round-up by BofA showed. [link](https://www.investing.com/news/economy/monster-reallocations-to-stocks-as-us-tax-threat-recedes--bofa-2619022) \n\n* Let\u2019s take a look at the EV market dynamics and upcoming catalysts before getting into GOEV specifically, so we get a high-level understanding of the bigger picture. The global EV market is expected to be valued at $725.1 Billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 27.19% from $171.26 in 2021 [source]( https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/electric-vehicle-market). By 2027, $1.007 trillion by 2027 which is an average of 2 sources - [source 1](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/electric-vehicle-market-analysis-size-regional-outlook-competitive-strategies-and-forecasts-to-2027-2021-07-12?tesla=y), [source 2](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/electric-vehicle-market-size-to-be-valued-at-1-212-1-billion-by-2027-owing-to-rising-number-of-government-initiatives-globally-to-promote-manufacturing--adoption-of-evs--million-insights-301238118.html), , another source actually has the market valued at $2.5 trillion but it\u2019s a bit of an outlier compared to the other 2 [source 3](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/11/2227050/0/en/Electric-Vehicle-EV-Market-Worth-2-495-4-Billion-by-2027-Growing-at-a-CAGR-of-33-6-From-2020-Exclusive-Report-by-Meticulous-Research.html).   \n\n* Global EV forecast is for a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent achieved over the next ten years: Total EV sales growing from 2.5 million in 2020 to 11.2 million in 2025, then reaching 31.1 million by 2030. EVs would secure approximately 32 per cent of the total market share for new car sales.  Despite the pressure exerted on the market by the COVID-19 pandemic, the long-term outlook for EVs is strong. The significant shift in expected volume of BEVs and PHEVs by 2030 is based on four factors: consumer sentiment, policy and regulation, OEM strategy and the role of corporate companies. All four of these factors saw major changes in direction over the last year, prior to the emergence of COVID-19, and have since been shaped further by the pandemic. [link](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/future-of-mobility/electric-vehicle-trends-2030.html) \n\n* In November 2018, an article came out stating that the number of EVs on U.S. roads was projected to reach 18.7 million in 2030, up from 1 million at the end of 2018. This is about 7 percent of the 259 million vehicles (cars and light trucks) expected to be on U.S. roads in 2030. Annual sales of EVs will exceed 3.5 million vehicles in 2030, reaching more than 20 percent of annual vehicle sales in 2030. About 9.6 million charge ports will be required to support 18.7 million EVs in 2030. This represents a significant investment in EV charging infrastructure. [link]( https://www.eei.org/resourcesandmedia/newsroom/Pages/Press%20Releases/EEI%20Celebrates%201%20Million%20Electric%20Vehicles%20on%20U-S-%20Roads.aspx). \n\n* As it turns out, that number of annual EV sales of 3.5 million vehicles in 2030 was revised to almost double of that in a November 2020 report, just 2 years after the previous article. The US electric vehicles market is now expected to reach 6.9 million unit sales by 2025, up 5x from 1.4 million unit sales forecast for 2020, due to government incentives driving EV ownership. Over 90% of states offered incentives for setting up EV charging infrastructure, with meaningful quality of life incentives and exemptions are offered across 39 states in the US, including easier payment plans for the purchase of EVs, limited-time incentives to accelerate EV adoption/conversion and lack of requirements for emission inspections across several states. [link]( https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/111920-us-ev-market-sales-to-rise-to-69-million-units-by-2025-frost-amp-sullivan)\n\n* President Biden is seeking a pledge from auto manufacturers that would see EVs make up 40% - 50% of new U.S. vehicle sales by 2030 [link 1](https://www.forbes.com/wheels/news/40-percent-evs-2030/), [link 2](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/biden-set-target-50-evs-by-2030-industry-backs-goal-2021-08-05/) which is double of the 20% forecast just three years earlier in 2018, and would likely occur only with strong support on the supply side through infrastructural and other support that would enable EV manufacturers to develop the capacity to produce the target number of vehicles, and demand side with respect to incentivizing people to purchase EVs. \n\n* EV tax credits jump to $12,500 in proposed $3.5 trillion budget blueprint Democrats passed a couple of weeks ago. This bill adds $4,500 to the current $7,500 tax credit available for a total of $12,500 potentially available to EV buyers. Internal Revenue Code Section 30D provides a tax credit to any person who purchased a qualifying EV during the year. It includes passenger vehicles and light-duty trucks. The proposal calls for $160 billion to fund subsidies and purchase incentives, EV charging infrastructure funding, EV manufacturing incentives, federal EV procurement requirements, and incentives to electrify heavy-duty commercial fleets. [link](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/ev-tax-credit-bill-biden/) \n\n* The proposed EV credits in the budget blueprint would last for 10 years and consumers would be allowed to deduct the value of the credit from the sales price at the time of purchase. In 2027, the $7,500 credit would only apply to U.S.-made vehicles. It would also create a new smaller credit for used EVs of up to $2,500. There are also lower credits for EVs with smaller battery packs. The bill says individual taxpayers must have an adjusted gross income of no more than $400,000 to get the new EV tax credit. It would limit the EV credit to cars priced at no more than $55,000, while trucks could be priced up to $74,000. In August, the Senate in a non-binding amendment narrowly voted in favor of prohibiting taxpayers from claiming EV tax credits if they make more than $100,000 annually or if vehicles cost more than $40,000. [link](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/11/us-democrats-propose-dramatic-expansion-of-ev-tax-credits-that-favors-big-three.html) \n\n* Furthermore, the bipartisan infrastructure plan, titled the American Jobs Plan, includes billions of dollars for other electrification efforts and for a national charging network. Specifically, the bipartisan plan includes $7.5 billion for a network of EV charging stations across the country. It also includes another $7.5 billion for electric buses and other transportation methods. [link](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/biden-infrastructure-ev-subsidies-charging-network/)  \n\n* States area also providing EV incentives to residents e.g. Gov. JB Pritzker signed Illinois\u2019 clean energy law which includes a $4,000 rebate for residents to buy an electric vehicle (EV). [link](https://www.mystateline.com/news/local-news/illinois-wants-to-give-you-4000-to-buy-an-electric-vehicle/). \n\n* By 2030, there\u2019s expected to be an 8% divergence between EV demand estimates and production plans, meaning there needs to be a massive scaling up of infrastructure/capacity of EV manufacturers over current projections in order to fill the gap in the market. [link](https://gyazo.com/66173e4431b4c6b30ac7ed0662f13f1c) \n\n**Part 2 \u2013 Company Overview and Unique Value Proposition**\n\n**Before we look into what\u2019s happened since my last post, let\u2019s go over a quick refresher on what the company does.** Canoo is a Los Angeles-based company that has developed breakthrough electric vehicles, with over 650 employees [link](https://investors.canoo.com/news-presentations/press-releases/detail/65/canoo-receives-initial-aa-esg-leader-rating-from-msci) from leading technology and automotive companies [link](https://www.canoo.com/about/). Canoo\u2019s Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that the company was focused on a product lineup that fits in the gaps of everybody else\u2019s lineup\u2026 take the turning radius of a Prius, the size of a Ford Ranger, Payload of F-150 and sell it as one vehicle [link](https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=1747). What makes this Canoo so special compared to other EVs is their modular platform, which is purpose-built to deliver maximum vehicle interior space and adaptable to support a wide range of vehicle applications for consumers and businesses. \n\nIt is this modular platform that led to Apple\u2019s interest and having talks with Canoo (the talks are assumed to have fallen apart because Canoo was looking for an investor while Apple was looking to make an acquisition), as the platform is different from ones developed by other startups and larger automakers because it integrates more of the car\u2019s electronics, allowing for greater flexibility in cabin design. It also features steer-by-wire technology, which also increases design flexibility and is not yet widely adopted in the industry. [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev).\n\nApple wasn\u2019t the only major company interested in Canoo, Hyundai Motor Group (Hyundai and Kia\u2019s parent company) actually went a lot farther than Apple did with Canoo, announcing a partnership in February 2020 to develop new electric vehicles based on the technological platform developed by Canoo [link](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia). This was extremely unusual and referred to as a significant victory for Canoo, as \u2018pretty much every electric vehicle startup has talked about wanting to license out their technology or partner with legacy automakers, almost none have landed a deal\u2026 Canoo now joins that small list despite only coming into existence at the end of 2017, when its founders started the company\u2019 [link](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia). \n\nUltimately this partnership did not go ahead because Canoo\u2019s chairman didn\u2019t feel as though it was worth it for Canoo, saying that the original deal with Hyundai didn\u2019t factor in the value of Canoo\u2019s IP, so a shift in strategy was made from licensing out the technology to protecting the IP and manufacturing and selling Canoo\u2019s own vehicles to commercial operators [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357318/canoo-hyundai-deal-dead-electric-vehicles-goev) \n\nRegarding the technology/IP - Canoo has developed the world\u2019s flattest skateboard platform, which enables class-leading passenger and cargo volume on a small vehicle footprint. For example, the lifestyle vehicle, which will offer the interior space of a large SUV, but on the exterior footprint of a compact car. To help achieve this, Canoo\u2019s suspension utilizes a double wishbone with two fiberglass leaf springs, mounted transversely in the front and rear of the platform. The dampers are mounted to the frame, eliminating the need for large shock towers that take up vital cabin space. The entire suspension system is incorporated into the skateboard and sits below the height of the tires. [link](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-shows-off-performance-and-versatility-of-skateboard-platform-for-the-first-time-in-video).\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the current automotive model and see how Canoo\u2019s approach and the use of the skateboard platform add so much more value than conventional ICE manufacturers [link](https://gyazo.com/041f5f426804ab087740da6c5b0b1aeb), currently the model is broken because 70-80% of the portion of vehicle lifetime profit is only generated after the first owner. The current model is geared towards the first owner and nothing more, with an assortment of OEMs/spare parts retailers/3rd party installers servicing vehicles after the initial sale. Canoo aims to change this by targeting multiple owners after the first purchase i.e. owners 2-4, offering customers the ability to upgrade the model of whichever vehicle they have or switch them entirely as the platform on which the vehicles are built is the same [link](https://gyazo.com/272959d52f3e8c169c711e9b18dbd98c). \n\nThe use, and subsequent re-use of the skateboard platform enables significant cost savings and risk reductions [link](https://gyazo.com/7ade9dac03f0e6fcbffc6b8f3942eb4c), with the platform providing a strong business advantage as it is consistent across Canoo\u2019s vehicle lineup. If a project is started for a new vehicle which will have the skateboard platform as its foundation, they will be able to carryover engineer and labor, ~half, from one project to the next. It\u2019s also worth pointing out that in traditional ICE, it would be exceptional if Bill of Materials cost carryover across variants reached 25%, with Canoo, this is exceeding 50%. The specific savings include:\n\n* 45% - 55% labor savings for new variants developed\n\n* 57% of the BOM cost carryover across variants\n\n* &gt;70% of critical functions are delivered by the platform.\n\nThese enable the development of space efficient cabins that integrate simply onto platform [link](https://gyazo.com/0a5777ed4387d9d9916a0c0d949f452e), and provide the key basis for engineering Canoo\u2019s new value proposition of having a harmonized and articulated 3 \u2013 layer vehicle concept that keeps fresh and returns capital over an entire vehicle lifecycle [link](https://gyazo.com/7992fbead2e3c724ec002333b8c909c8). This image also showcases how Canoo aims to capture the full vehicle lifecycle value [link](https://gyazo.com/ca0abdaece1006dbb34ad42b60bb2977) \n\nThe three vehicles that Canoo has publicly announced as part of its lineup are:\n\nLifestyle vehicle [link](https://www.canoo.com/canoo/) - Fully electric, highly versatile and offering more utility inside and out for city explorers, businesses, families and adventurers. The multi-purpose platform unlocks SUV-size interior space on a smaller exterior footprint. It\u2019s pretty hard to put into an image of the vehicle into words so I\u2019d recommend clicking on the above link to check it out for yourself. Some key figures (note the range provided in certain cases is for the variants):\n\n* Launching late 2022.\n\n* Starting at $34,750*\n\n* 2 seats - 5 seats - 7 seats\n\n* 250 mi range\n\n* Up to 350 Horsepower \n\n* 28min charge time 80%\n\n* 188 ft\u00b3 interior volume\n\n* 80 KWh battery\n\n* 1,464 lbs payload \u2013 2,000 lbs capacity\n\nMulti-purpose Delivery Vehicle [link](https://www.canoo.com/mpdv/) \u2013 Business ready vehicle that lowers the total cost of ownership while providing easy maintenance. More cargo in a small footprint to enable easy maneuverability. A productivity tool that enables you to plug in your tools and get to work. Some key figures (note the range provided in certain cases is for the variants):\n\n* Starting at $33,000*\n\n* 200 ft\u00b3 - 500 ft\u00b3 cargo volume\n\n* 130 \u2013 230 mi, 90 \u2013 190 mi range (EPA)\n\n* 1,540 to 1,980 lbs\n\nPickup [link](https://www.canoo.com/pickup/) \u2013 All Electric, All American, All Utility - The Pickup Truck is built to be the new standard in function, form and utility \u2014 ready for work and the weekend. The picup truck is as strong as the toughest trucks out there and includes features for people who use trucks on the job, weekend, and adventure. Some key figures (note the range provided in certain cases is for the variants):\n\n* Launching as early as 2023.\n\n* Price \u2013 Not currently listed, but during the Q&amp;A portion of the investor day portion on June 30th, somebody asked what the base pricing for the pickup was, given that the Ford lightning F-150 base price was being advertised at $32,000. Chairman Tony Aquila said Canoo was not prepared to announce the pricing at that time, but Canoo would not be beaten in this category \u2013 you can check it out at the following link [link](https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=10908)  \n\n* Targeted HP \u2013 500+\n\n* Payload Capacity \u2013 1800 lbs\n\n* Range \u2013 200+ mi\n\n* Powertrain \u2013 AWD or RWD\n\nThere\u2019s actually a fourth vehicle as well that hasn\u2019t been listed anywhere officially but was found by /u/Mcardiel007 when he was having issues communicating with Canoo and went to their Torrance location and spotted them unloading what is potentially the new sedan. All credits to him/her for the following pictures [pic 1](https://gyazo.com/5e84005c8399352f2de9efbedeb3d933), [pic 2](https://gyazo.com/608a14d42df52284544bfbf0cf4a2912?token=1800737b805fc34222e29805d032b29c), [pic 3](https://gyazo.com/906b46f350bed3e4ed10357422bf548a), [pic 4](https://gyazo.com/5dd4b620f07fcb72fdb2234dfc35a36a), [pic 5](https://gyazo.com/83e23a1219e08bd6a2d118138121a714). \n\nWe can see that Canoo is targeting the most attractive segments at a lower incremental cost. The most profitable and highest carbon dioxide emitting segments are pickups and SUVs, with $115B+ accounting for 90% of 2020 profit pool in US, and ~60% of the transportation emissions (Canoo is targeting these segments with its Lifestyle Vehicle and Pickup). One of the fastest growing segments is delivery vans, with ~2M more delivery vehicles needed globally by 2030 [link](https://gyazo.com/309703e692c4a4fa96cd91096b593ac4). It\u2019s important to keep in mind existing fleet conversion to EV as well. Using the common platform provides a pivot-ability to focus on high margin products and is a large and profitable opportunity \u2013 highly lucrative and accretive to overall margin [link](https://gyazo.com/51a7448bc7b0c236d6c4b528eb662dda). \n\nCanoo is also looking at car data and not just strictly being a vehicle manufacturer \u2013 with an opportunity for harmonizing hardware and software + superior cleaning leading to actionable data instead of the status quo of outsourced hardware + poor cleaning leading to disjointed data.

The facility will be built on a 400-acre site at the MidAmerica Industrial Park complex in Pryor, Oklahoma. It will house a paint shop, body shop, and general assembly plant.

By parallel pathing contract and owned manufacturing Canoo will meet its commitment to start production and deliver vehicles in Q4, 2022. Canoo Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that VDL Nedcar \u2018is the top trusted European manufacturer building high quality products for leading OEMs, and they significantly outcompeted the other contenders. VDL is also independently owned by the van der Leegte family of entrepreneurs - which aligns with our commitment to support businesses that form the backbone of communities. This strategic partnership will enable us to deliver vehicles to market while we build our Phase 2 factory in Oklahoma. It also strongly positions us for geographic expansion in Europe and builds a lasting relationship with VDL Groep of companies. Our investment will help us scale quickly and fulfill our mission to bring affordable, purpose-built EVs to Everyone.

Lafferty - $19 [link]( https://www.investing.com/news/rf-lafferty-stick-to-their-buy-rating-for-canoo-2568124)\n\n* H.C. Wainright - $15 [link](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-goev-a-buy-or-sell-right-now-2021-09/)\n\n* Bank of America - $5 (can\u2019t find the article at the moment but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve seen it somewhere)\n\nAverage = $13, current SP = $6.7\n\nAs of Canoo\u2019s second quarter 10Q, the company had cash on hand of $563.6 million [link](https://investors.canoo.com/financial-information/balance-sheet), which according to the company is more than sufficient to cover the cost of bringing its first products to markets [link](https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=9398). \n\nAt a pre-revenue stage there\u2019s not too much to say in this department, other than to note that value of a couple of orders:\n\n* &gt;9,500 non-binding preorders \u2013 which if they are followed through with would be worth at least $313,500,00 (assuming 9,500 orders of the cheapest vehicle which is the base model MPDV).\n\n* 10,000 MPDVs for the frontdoor collective which would be worth at least $330,000,000 (assuming cheapest MPDV).\nAs far as valuations go, let\u2019s divide the pre-revenue EV manufacturers into tiers for an easier look \u2013 based on their market cap. I\u2019m sure some are missing because I only took a few, let me know and I\u2019ll add them in later. These market caps were taken within a few moments of each other on 9/21 from yahoo finance.\n\n* Lucid Motors \u2013 $41.23B, 11,000 pre-orders, delivery delayed to fall 2021\n\n* Nikola Corporation - $4.25B, lowered delivery guidance of 25/50 vehicles for 2021 \n\n* Fisker Inc - $3.917B, &gt;17,000 pre-orders, value of $637,483,000 \n\n* Faraday Future - $3.66B, 300 FF 91 Vehicles, value of $54,000,000 delivery in 2022 \n\n* Canoo \u2013 $1.63B, 19,500 pre-orders (9,500 individual + 10,000 front door collective), value of $643,500,000, delivery fall 2022 for LV, 2023 for MPDV \n\n* Company 1 (market cap too low, has a DOJ investigation ongoing and issued a going concern for whether it would have cash to make it to production) - $1.2B\n\nJust looking at a couple of examples here it would seem that Canoo is undervalued purely on a pre-orders/revenue perspective. Fisker and Faraday Future, which are both expected to deliver in 2022 as is the case with Canoo, have over double the market cap despite Canoo having similar preorder value (compared to Fisker) or much higher (compared to Faraday Future). Haven\u2019t done a cash flow analysis of every company but even taking into consideration Fisker having $400M more in cash on hand [source](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-242552/), there\u2019s a significant discrepancy. Faraday Future meanwhile has less than half of Canoo\u2019s cash on hand at $230M [link](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-242552/).  \n\n**Part 6 \u2013 Bear Case**\n\nWith anything pre-revenue, the biggest issue is always going to be do we have enough cash to get the product off the ground imo. I could write a really long paragraph but yea that\u2019s pretty much it in a sentence. Since I\u2019m on the bullish side for the company, I\u2019ll lay out a few reasons why I think Canoo won\u2019t be running out of $$$ before it comes to market \u2013 these have mostly been stated here and there throughout this document but I\u2019ll summarize them below:\n\n* As of Canoo\u2019s second quarter 10Q, the company had cash on hand of $563.6 million which according to the company is more than sufficient to cover the cost of bringing the Lifestyle Vehicle to market. \n\n* Oklahoma is providing an incentive package that totals over $300 million, and may kick in millions more based on whether Canoo hits or exceeds a target of hiring military veterans to make up 10 percent of the workforce at the facility.\n\n* EV funding is a significant portion of the upcoming budget, this is less grounded than the others but there is assumedly some hopium that Canoo would be able to receive some federal support if needed.\n\n* The company could take on debt to assist in getting to production \u2013 H.C. Wainwright in their coverage indicated that they expect $500M to $525M in funding could be raised in debt to 2023. Tony has previously stated that they are looking for as non-dilutive an approach as possible, and given the current SP it wouldn\u2019t make much sense to go the additional equity route.\n\n**Part 7 \u2013 SI and Squeeze Potential**\n\nI know y\u2019all have just been waiting for this so I\u2019ll get right down to it. Famously developed by the esteemed /u/pennyether, the SMELL system is going to help us take a look at some key numbers that\u2019ll help understand GOEV\u2019s squeezability.\n\n* Short Interest \u2013 31.8 million shares, 32% of free float \n\n* Market Cap \u2013 - $1.63 Billion, not big enough that it\u2019s immovable, not small enough that shorts would be able to cover without investing a decent amount of capital.\n\n* Extremely Memeable \u2013 I mean\u2026 GOEV, like Go\u2026 EV, idk I think it ticks off the memeability criteria.\n\n* Low Liquidity \u2013 Average volume per yahoo finance is 2.7M shares, which is 2.7% of the free float so any inflow will cause the share price to move pretty significantly. Over the last quarter, it seems that institutions have been loading up on Canoo for cheap, with institutional inflows of $177M and only $2.56M sold [link](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GOEV/institutional-ownership/)\n\n* Low Risk (IV) \u2013 Yep, current IV is 77.1% for 9/24 and 10/1 options. Please do NOT consider this financial advice, like at all, but if you\u2019re one of the folks who look to just buy options for the sake of contributing to a gamma squeeze, take a read of the post /u/ChemaKyle made yesterday, specifically the portion pertaining to buying far OTM options and how it\u2019s a bad idea if you want the MMs to hedge. There\u2019s not much of a need to hedge vs something that doesn\u2019t have a ramp up and no OI at the ATM values. I\u2019d agree with his/her post and the commentators that buying ATM options and the underlying shares would have a greater chance at causing a gamma squeeze, but this is something you should research and do your own DD on as well based on your risk tolerance and investment threshold.\n\n**Part 8 \u2013 TL;DR**\n\nThe global EV market is expected to be valued at $725.1 Billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 27.19% from $171.26 in 2021, with total EV sales growing from 2.5 million in 2020 to 11.2 million in 2025, then reaching 31.1 million by 2030. EVs would secure approximately 32 per cent of the total market share for new car sales.  The US electric vehicles market is now expected to reach 6.9 million unit sales by 2025, up 5x from 1.4 million unit sales forecast for 2020, due to government incentives driving EV ownership. \n\nPresident Biden is seeking a pledge from auto manufacturers that would see EVs make up 40% - 50% of new U.S. vehicle sales by 2030, to support this EV tax credits jump to $12,500 in the proposed $3.5 trillion budget blueprint Democrats passed a couple of weeks ago. In August, the Senate in a non-binding amendment narrowly voted in favor of prohibiting taxpayers from claiming EV tax credits if they make more than $100,000 annually or if vehicles cost more than $40,000. Either way, this is huge for Canoo which is offering base models of the Lifestyle Vehicle and MPDV at &lt;$35,000, with the base pickup model expected to be priced similarly. \n\nCanoo aims to disrupt the current automotive model by taking a piece of the 70-80% of the portion of vehicle lifetime profit which is generated after the first owner and traditionally ignored by manufacturers. Canoo aims to change this by targeting multiple owners after the first purchase i.e. owners 2-4, offering customers the ability to upgrade the model of whichever vehicle they have or switch them entirely as the platform on which the vehicles are built is the same. Canoo is targeting the most attractive segments at a lower incremental cost. The most profitable and highest carbon dioxide emitting segments are pickups and SUVs, with $115B+ accounting for 90% of 2020 profit pool in US, and ~60% of the transportation emissions (Canoo is targeting these segments with its Lifestyle Vehicle and Pickup) and targeting one of the fastest growing segments of delivery vans, for which ~2M more delivery vehicles will be needed globally by 2030, with its MPDV.\n\nTo facilitate this disruption, Canoo has developed the world\u2019s flattest skateboard platform, which enables class-leading passenger and cargo volume on a small vehicle footprint. Canoo\u2019s Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that the company was focused on a product lineup that fits in the gaps of everybody else\u2019s lineup\u2026 take the turning radius of a Prius, the size of a Ford Ranger, Payload of F-150 and sell it as one vehicle. The use, and subsequent re-use of the skateboard platform enables significant cost savings and risk reductions, with the platform providing a strong business advantage as it is consistent across Canoo\u2019s vehicle lineup. If a project is started for a new vehicle which will have the skateboard platform as its foundation, they will be able to carryover engineer and labor, ~half, from one project to the next.\n\n* 45% - 55% labor savings for new variants developed\n\n* 57% of the BOM cost carryover across variants (compared to ~25% on ICE)\n\n* &gt;70% of critical functions are delivered by the platform.\n\nIf we take a look at all the funding incentives that are being proposed for consumers in an example with the Lifestyle Vehicle, the maximum federal rebate would be $12,500 on a new vehicle, and if we add in state incentives e.g. Illinois with it\u2019s $4,000 rebate \u2013 that turns into a $16,500 rebate. The LV is priced at $34,750 which means that post-rebates you\u2019re going to be getting it at almost half the price which is pretty ridiculous in comparison to ICE vehicles, add in the tighter emissions standards for ICE vehicles and Canoo starts looking pretty good.\n\nIf you made it this far, I\u2019d like to thank you for reading this \u2013 I\u2019d like to give a big shoutout to the community over on the canoo subreddit (not sure if I can link other subs so won\u2019t). They\u2019re extremely resourceful and dedicated individuals who provide a wealth of knowledge on the ongoings of the company \u2013 from driving to HQ and coincidentally finding an unrevealed product and sharing it with everyone, to attending EXPOs and other showcase events and dedicating their time to sharing vehicle images and detailed write-ups on conversations with Canoo leadership and potential customers. Y\u2019all the real MVPs.\n\n**Position** - 1,000 shares @ 11.69.",

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, September 17, 2021**\n\nStocks declined today, reversing from yesterday\u2019s gain given today was a quadruple witching event and market participants continue to digest a slew of new economic data and the potential implications for monetary policy. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 0.97% down, the Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 1.19% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.53% down. As of today\u2019s close, September is headed for its first negative month all year.\n\nToday was the quarterly quadruple witching, an event wherein individual stock options and futures, and index options and futures, all expire the same day. Typically, this event has elevated volume and volatility on the day and days leading up to it. Definitely one of the reasons for today\u2019s decline. \n\nWith the coronavirus Delta variant fanning fears of a slowdown in growth in the US and China, market participants have been carefully weighing incoming economic data. In the US, August retail sales showed an unexpected rise despite the latest surge of coronavirus Delta variant cases. The Commerce Department's August retail sales report showed overall sales rose by 0.7% on the month after a downwardly revised 1.8% drop in July. Consensus economists were looking for a 0.7% drop. \n\nA few days ago, China\u2019s retail sales report showed a dramatic slowdown in growth as the country battles rising coronavirus cases and seasonal floodings, with output and sales reaching a one-year low. Consumer spending grew 2.5% in the month of August, a sharp deceleration from the 8.5% growth in July and missing estimates of 7% growth. Industrial production rose 5.3% in August from a year earlier, narrowing from an increase of 6.4% in July and marking the weakest pace since July 2020, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday. Output growth missed the 5.8% increase tipped by analysts.\n\nAll the recent data will factor into the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest assessment of the economy, which is set to be released next week via the meeting minutes. Market participants are anxiously waiting to see if the incoming meeting minutes have a signal regarding the timing to announce plans to begin tapering the pace of quantitative easing. \n\nMark Luschini, Chief Investment Strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, said \u201cI think it\u2019s really a tug of war at the moment that is underway, which is to say, there\u2019s still good news on the economy. In fact, in the last two days, we've gotten some good regional Fed survey reports and today's retail sales number. But at the same time, it's in the context of this overall deceleration of growth we've seen so far in the third quarter \\[and\\] worries about the Delta variant.\u201d\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* According to the University of Michigan\u2019s closely watched consumer sentiment survey, sentiment improved only slightly in September after reaching its lowest level since 2011 in August. The headline index in the institution's Surveys of Consumers ticked up to 71.0 in the preliminary reading, compared to the 70.3 posted in August. Consensus economists were looking for the index to improve to 72.0 in September.\n* Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc will give a one-time bonus of $1,250 to its full-time pharmacists and a $1,000 payment to part-time pharmacists, the drugstore chain said on Friday, as major retailers try to retain people amid intense labor shortages. This is a similar effort other retailers have employed.\n* Irish regulators raised privacy concerns regarding Facebook\u2019s (FB) new smart glasses. The concern comes that people have a difficult timing  telling whether the glasses are filming or not\n* Tencent (TCEHY) opens WeChat, the super app with more than $1 billion users, to allows rivals to display their links. This comes after Chinese regulators banned the practice of Chinese tech companies banning links to rivals within their platforms\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Agilent Technologies (A) target raised by Cowen from $!65 to $200 at Outperform.

        "selftext": "TLDR\n\nThis article was written by Dogefather's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 \u203a who ascertains as a result of research \u203a to provide thorough \u203a readable \u203a analysis. His trading strategy is Long only \u203a Value \u203a Growth \u203a with a medium to long-term horizon. Dogeboy is generally wary of tech stocks \u203a as this sector is ripe for disruption. However \u203a due to TEAM's steady predictability &amp; rapidly growing revenues \u203a he aggressively solicits a posture of Atlassian long game \u203a as one can make room in a portfolio for tech companies that are the disruptors &amp; carry a moat. \n\nConnected Enterprise\n\nAtlassian \u203a TEAM \u203a produces software that helps teams work together more efficiently &amp; effectively \u203a offering a broad set of \u203a easy to deploy &amp; use tools \u2933 Jira \u203a Confluence \u203a Bitbucket \u203a Trello.\n\n83% of Fortune 500 companies use Atlassian software products \u203a utilized by more than 212K customers at both large &amp; small organizations \u203a for open teamwork models &amp; autonomous project planning &amp; management \u203a that provides an environment for enterprises to experiment &amp; optimize employee experience \u203a for frictionless work environments \u203a business partners \u203a in a connected vendor ecosystem \u203a for easy interaction back &amp; forth &amp; quick response to market signals \u203a &amp; connect with customers \u203a to deepen relationships via those processes.\n\nAs teamwork becomes increasingly digital \u203a investing in a connected enterprise is the clear path forward for 10 million monthly active users who use Atlassian cloud collaboration management tools &amp; help desk solutions \u203a to support a variety of collaboration styles &amp; provide standardization to innovate &amp; cut costs. \n\nAtlassian operates in 4 segments \u2933 1 \u203a subscriptions \u203a term licenses &amp; cloud agreements \u2933 2 \u203a maintenance \u203a annual maintenance contracts that provide support &amp; periodic updates &amp; are generally attached to perpetual license sales \u2933 3 \u203a perpetual license \u203a upfront sale for indefinite usage of the software \u2933 4 \u203a other \u203a training \u203a strategic consulting &amp; revenue from the Atlassian Marketplace app store.\n\nFirst Mover Advantage\n\nWhat sets Atlassian apart is its first mover advantage in its core market. Given the time sensitive nature &amp; delivery windows of most software projects \u203a most of Atlassian's customers simply don\u2019t have the appetite for risking project execution nor the time to adopt a new platform. This has resulted in creating a moat \u203a  as there are indirect costs associated with the learning curve &amp; switching altogether to another platform. \n\nAtlassian delivers the tools &amp; platforms that developers need to build applications \u203a with every company in every sector becoming a software-driven company \u203a there will be almost infinite demand for new applications. As developers raced to build new applications to help their companies cope with the pandemic \u203a they gravitated toward the tools that enabled them to work the fastest &amp; most efficiently. Every company from the smallest mom &amp; pop shop to the largest multinational realized with utmost clarity that they would live or die by software.\n\n\u201cWe are a multi-product company. We differ from many companies that get product/market fit &amp; grow to $500 million in revenue before their second product. We introduced a second product \u203a Confluence \u203a before we reached that scale. We found that customers perceived that software documentation is poor \u2014 we developed a product for document collaboration that\u2019s like a Google Doc on steroids. We have multi-product in our DNA. We now have 14 different products.\u201d \u2933 Cameron Deatsch - Chief Revenue Officer.\n\nAtlassian applies the now-popular agile systems development mindset to all its operations. \n\n\u201cAs far as process \u203a we use an agile approach. This differs \u203a from the traditional waterfall approach \u203a in which system requirements are developed over two years &amp; handed off to the systems development people to build. With agile \u203a we start with customer goals &amp; iteratively build versus the goals. Every two weeks we ship something &amp; learn from it. We can apply this approach to marketing \u203a closing the books \u203a &amp; so on. We have daily stand-ups &amp; two week sprints.\"\n\nCustomer Growth\n\nAtlassian products meet a unique market need for business customers \u203a modernizing collaboration through human-centered technology \u2933 including office productivity tools \u203a video conferencing platforms \u203a file synchronization \u203a sharing solutions \u203a content management apps &amp; more \u2933 empowering companies to design experiences that unlock less fragmented workflows &amp; bring people together in seamless \u203a interconnected &amp; digital experiences.\n\nThey are able to land customers at a low cost with little human intervention. In the latest quarter \u203a Atlassian brought in 17k new customers who never talked to people at Atlassian or its partners \u203a equating to a robust 9.5% sequential QoQ growth \u203a driven by 5.7k  Trello accounts \u203a as a result of new product features &amp; TEAM\u2019s recent sales funnel optimization initiatives.\n\nThe addressable market size in total is an estimated $125 billion \u203a in terms of potential users \u203a including 800 million knowledge workers at the highest level \u203a drilling down to 100 million technical team members &amp; 23 million software developers. Atlassian noted\u00a0during the recent industry conference \u203a the company continues to out its online ecosystem \u203a with a marketplace for over 4k apps that utilize its product technology \u2933 recently launched Forge \u203a which provides runtime for these apps.\n\nAtlassian invents new products through processes propelled by its employees. \u203a it builds on its strengths \u2933 a focus on teams\u203a of which there are many different kinds in different industries \u203a come up with new products by looking at customer use cases &amp; trends outside the norm. Service management is the fastest growing product.\n\nRevenue Growth\n\nAtlassian continues its strong track record of growth \u203a Q3\u201921 revenue growing 38% YoY \u203a driven by subscription revenue growth of 43% YoY. Subscription now comprises 62% of TEAM\u2019s total revenue &amp; its recurring nature helps to smooth out the revenue stream \u203a resulting in higher predictability.\n\nAtlassian has grown impressively over the past few years because it adopts a low-cost web-based marketing &amp; lean transactional operating model \u203a going without a traditional enterprise salesforce &amp; marketing team. Atlassian has a large opportunity ahead \u203a demonstrating strong profitability relative to peers \u203a with a gross profit margin of 84% \u203a far higher than the 49% sector average \u203a a strong balance sheet &amp; plenty of cash to fund future growth initiatives \u203a its FCF margin is 43% \u203a comparing favorably to 12.6% sector median. \n\nGiven the subscription-heavy nature of the business \u203a Atlassian's revenue stream has resulted in sequential quarterly revenue growth over at least the past 3 years &amp; this includes pandemic quarters. Atlassian stopped new sales of server license \u203a increased pricing &amp; created pull-forward effects that incentivize users to renew early \u203a leading to strong revenue &amp; billings growth. Atlassian has demonstrated impressive revenue growth since its IPO in 2015 \u203a growing by 513% over this timeframe to $1.96 billion for the trailing 12 months. Atlassian maintains a fortress balance sheet to fund growth initiatives, with $1.56 billion in cash &amp; short-term investments \u203a no long-term debt, and just $206M in capital leases.\n\nTEAM has outperformed the market in the last year with a price return of \u2191 91.4% while the SPY ETF gained \u2191 30.1%. TEAM has also outperformed the stock market ETF in the last 3 month &amp; 2 week periods returning \u2191 62.1% &amp; \u2191 11.3% \u203a respectively \u203a SPY returned \u2191 8.3% &amp; \u2191 3.2%. Last quarter \u203a Atlassian reported $560 million in Revenue &amp; $.24 earnings per share \u203a this beat revenue expectation by $35 million &amp; exceeded earnings estimates by $.06.\n\nValuation\n\nPotential for competition from legacy software provider Microsoft \u203a MSFT \u203a in the space in which TEAM operates. Atlassian will directly compete against ServiceNow \u203a NOW \u203a as it encroaches on the service desk space. Atlassian\u2019s formal planning processes are adjusted so it can adapt to new threats or opportunities. That\u2019s what happened last year when a competitor\u2019s IPO gave it extra capital to spend on marketing to Atlassian\u2019s customers. Atlassian reprioritized go-to-market resources to keep customer acquisition up in light of that competitor\u2019s spending. One product leader got less. They have OKRs &amp; they adjust.\n\nDisclosure\n\nWithout data \u203a you're just another \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f with an opinion \u2933 Dogeboy\u2019s 17 Sep 21 calls are \u2191 770%",

        "selftext": "If you\u2019ve been following Reddit and Twitter from last week, CCJ has been one of the most talked about tickers, and rightfully so as the stock is up 60% in one month and 15% just last week. Interestingly enough, on Friday the stock price closed at the area with the most Gamma Exposure (GEX) at $25 per share.\n\nPersonally, I like Uranium as a long-term hold, but this price action deserves some paying attention to and potentially taking some profits off the table.\n\nFor those of you that don\u2019t remember or haven\u2019t read some of my other posts. Here\u2019s a description of the boxes/zones I\u2019ve overlaid on the chart.\n\n* Red Zone = FOMO area and very high-risk, high-reward play.\n* Orange Zone = The stock has normalized back a reasonable level, but is still somewhat volatile. r/R (risk/reward) is already way better than a red zone.\n* Green Zone = The stock is at a much better post-hype entry level. This area is a prime risk-to-reward when looking at a swing trade.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mwz91k3tj5n71.png?width=2402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46d2784339171190537fc231271da66977f58f31\n\nOf course, these zones are very easy to notice after-the-fact. Going into June CCJ would have looked to have been on a steady up-trend and buying any dips earlier this year along the way would have netted some nice returns.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019ll be keeping an eye on CCJ next week to see what happens with this squeeze or if it reverts back to the mean. Entering a new position here and chasing FOMO is extremely risky. I\u2019ll be keeping an eye on this if it goes back into the low $20\u2019s to enter another position.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet\u2019s look at my short-list of \u201cbuy the dip\u201d stocks this week.\n\n# The BTFD (Buy The F\u2019n Dip) List\n\n**Ametek (AME)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vxu2m9vtj5n71.png?width=2404&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76b6eedffa4f173e1d7823cf47d626d7372fa41b\n\nIf you don\u2019t know about Ametek then all you need to know is that it is a beast of a company. Strong fundamentals, strong business model, and is nicknamed the \u201cniche acquirer\u201d from their strategic list of acquisitions. AME is typically a very slow moving stock, similar to Microsoft, but if you zoom the chart out over a couple years you\u2019ll see this thing only goes up. The very small dip recently might prove to be a good entry point if you\u2019ve been waiting to get in for some time. Ex-dividend date is also tomorrow. So I would expect this to be slightly green, if the market permits, to make up for the div.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Salesforce (CRM)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3gbqynguj5n71.png?width=2408&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff07c616c63147ba228d85cb40554afc87a63f6b\n\nAnother long-term stock for my portfolio. CRM saw some tailwinds early on during Covid, but over the last 12 months the stock price has stalled. In my opinion last week\u2019s dip could be a good entry. The $250 level, which was previously resistance, might also be a good support zone to enter. Keep an eye on the 50 EMA which it was been bouncing off during this recent uptrend since May.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The MEME List\n\nThe \u201cmeme\u201d list isn\u2019t necessarily meme stocks, but it\u2019s what I refer to when I\u2019m talking about stocks that have potential to trend on social media, or they are generally higher-risk growth-stocks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Square (SQ)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ac8k3eivj5n71.png?width=2408&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4acc054e09790d4fe23db1354c236820e9f75658\n\nSquare, which saw insane growth through Covid, has somewhat lost it\u2019s momentum. This 10% dip over the last several weeks gives it a better entry than at $275 when it was a slightly over-extended. RSI hitting over-sold and volume profile sitting right at the shelf where trading volume thins out. IMO this is a quality name to own for the long-term and although the stock is up a lot in the last 6 months, today offers a better entry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**D-Local (DLO)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iyi3bw6vj5n71.png?width=2398&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc147db4aed6820b9733439128a7beaf69f62766\n\nYou don\u2019t see this name around Reddit too much, but I think it deserves to get on most people\u2019s radar. DLO is a payment processor for Latin America, and 3rd world/emerging markets. The growth they are experiencing is over 100% YoY, which drove the stock price +30% on earnings in August. Since then it\u2019s had about a month\u2019s worth of consolidation at the $65 level. I think here at $62 provides an \u201corange box\u201d entry which I am willing to take a risk at. Ideally I would have liked to enter in the $50\u2019s, but that\u2019s what investing is all about, finding ideal risk-to-reward opportunities.",

        "selftext": "Disclosure: This is not financial advice and this is my personal opinion on the stock. You take full responsibility for your own action.\n\nWho is CrowdStrike?\n\nCrowdStrike is a cybersecurity company that provides endpoint and workload protection solutions via its Falcon cloud-based platform. The firm is referred to as the \"Salesforce of Security\" by the CEO. Crowdstrike has benefited from the \u2018work from home' trend, which has resulted in an increase in endpoint devices and burden on the cloud, making endpoint protection critical. It competes in a highly competitive market, but it has excelled by focusing on continual client acquisition and innovation. CrowdStrike has produced outstanding results and is well-positioned to develop in the market because of its great technology.\n\nCrowdStrike is a bet on the rising need for cloud-based cybersecurity solutions. The company is a global leader in endpoint security solutions, with a growing market share. The capacity of the firm to enroll major clients, cross-sell solutions, develop new product offerings, and grow its worldwide penetration is critical to its success.\n\nCrowdStrike Leadership Management\n\nCrowdStrike was formed in 2011 by **George Kurtz, Dmitri Alperovitch, and Gregg Marston** with the goal of developing a cloud computing security solution. They proposed the idea to Warburg Pincus, a private equity firm, and received $25 million in investment. George is still the company's CEO, although Gregg resigned in 2015 and Dmitri (previous CTO) departed in early 2020 to create a non-profit group.\n\n**George Kurtz** is the company's founder, president, and CEO. He was CTO and EVP of McAfee before starting CrowdStrike. George previously established Foundstone, a security firm that was eventually bought by McAfee in 2004. He has previously held key positions in the cybersecurity area at EY and PwC. He graduated from Seton Hall University with a B.S. in Accounting. Here's a link to a recent interview with Kurtz. As of April 2020, George owned 22.4 percent of the firm.\n\nIn February 2020, **Michael Sentonas** was appointed CTO of the business. He was formerly the company's Vice President of Technology Strategy. Prior to joining CrowdStrike, he served as McAfee's Chief Technology Officer \u2013 Security Connected and Chief Technology and Strategy Officer \u2014 APAC. He graduated from Edith Cowan University with a bachelor's degree in computer science (Australia).\n\nColin Black joined the business as CIO in 2015 and then became COO in 2017. Prior to joining CrowdStrike, he was CIO of Kratos Defense and Security Solutions, Inc. and Cymer &amp; Mindspeed Technologies, Inc. He graduated from the University of Glasgow with a B.S. in Electronics Engineering. As of April 2020, all executive officers and directors collectively owned 11% of the firm.\n\nCrowdStrike's Endpoint Security, IT Operations and Intelligence\n\nFalcon Prevent, Falcon Insights, Falcon Device Control, and Falcon Firewall Management are all modules in this category. These modules aid in the protection against malware and fileless assaults, as well as the real-time visibility and investigation of occurrences at client endpoints and USB devices. Customers may also use solutions to design, implement, and manage firewall rules and policies.\n\nFalcon OverWatch, Falcon Discover, Falcon Complete, and Falcon Spotlight are modules that handle this section. They assist clients with detecting threats, identifying rogue apps and systems, detecting real-time vulnerability across many endpoints without scanning, and combining endpoint security with repair and response capabilities. In addition, the firm offers application licensing management, AWS expenditure analysis, and asset inventory solutions.\n\nFalcon X, Falcon Search Engine, and Falcon Sandbox are among the modules available in this market. These modules aid in the automation of threat analysis, the real-time search for malware, malware analysis, and threat research and reporting.\n\nHow does CrowdStrike make money?\n\nCustomers are paid monthly fees based on the amount of endpoints and cloud modules they utilize while utilizing CrowdStrike's Falcon platform. Customers are invoiced in advance on an annual or multi-year basis, and the agreements typically last one to three years. Subscription-based revenue accounts for over 92 percent of the company's revenue, providing great revenue predictability. Professional services, which include malware analysis, incident response, forensic, proactive, and other services, account for the remaining 8%. These are non-recurring and are billed on an hourly or fixed rate basis. The company's professional services segment assists it in cross-selling its subscription-based products.\n\nCrowdStrike paid $96 million for Preempt Security in September 2020. Preempt is a Zero Trust and restricted access technology supplier that can identify and prevent attacks in real time based on identification, behavior, and risk. This purchase would enhance the company's Zero Trust capabilities, which aid in identification and verification, enabling access to only authenticated users. Following the completion of the integration with Preempt, the firm intends to launch a new module on the Falcon platform. The United States accounts for 73% of the company's sales, EMEA accounts for 14%, Asia Pacific accounts for 8%, and other areas account for the remaining 5%.\n\nTo identify and avoid potential dangers, the firm employs AI and machine learning. As more data is available to train AI, the value proposition of the products increases with increased adoption and user base. Over time, this results in a more efficient and effective platform. Furthermore, because of the platform's cloud-native architecture, security solutions may be installed fast on an endpoint in less than 30 seconds, offering prompt deployment and protection.\n\nAccording to the company's presentation, CrowdStrike has a total addressable market of $26.9 billion, which is anticipated to increase at a CAGR of 9% to $31.9 billion by 2022. The business endpoint security industry is worth $8.1 billion. The firm has a market penetration rate of less than 3%, leaving plenty of potential for expansion. The launch of new cloud modules would increase the size of the addressable market.\n\nCurrent development of the Company\ud83d\udcf7\n\n[wow](https://preview.redd.it/0bw7h5zl92q71.png?width=398&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6fa82ab01df3abad49c2648616b8e5f42df3d64)\n\nCrowdStrike produced a significant topline performance as well as a bottom-line improvement in Q2 2021. It has benefited by the continuous work-from-home trend and COVID-19 shelter-in-place mandates, which have resulted in increasing workloads on the cloud and a bigger number of endpoints in an enterprise, necessitating the need for enhanced endpoint security. In fact, the business established a program to assist customers in onboarding new remote employees without jeopardizing security.\n\nOverall, it added 969 clients during the quarter, bringing the total number of consumers to 7,230, a 91 percent rise year on year. In Q2 2021, sales were $199 million, up 84 percent year on year, while subscription revenue increased by 89 percent. Subscription ARR was $791M in Q2 2021, up 87 percent year on year. This significant growth was driven by increased client acquisition throughout the quarter, as well as the sale of additional endpoints and modules to existing customers. During the quarter, 33 percent of subscription income came from new clients, while 32 percent came from the sale of additional endpoints and modules to existing customers.\n\nCrowdStrike's Competitors\n\nCrowdStrike works in a cutthroat business with a fast-changing technical environment. It competes with BlackBerry's Cylance, VMware Carbon Black, Trend Micro, Fortinet, McAfee Endpoint Security, Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection, Avast Advanced Endpoint Protection, and other endpoint solution providers. It also competes with antivirus solution providers such as McAfee, Kaspersky, Microsoft, and others, as well as network security companies such as Palo Alto Networks and FireEye.\n\nDespite this competitive market, the company's excellent cloud-based technology has consistently generated significant revenue growth and client acquisition. According to an IDC research, it was able to quadruple its market share in the corporate endpoint category, while the market share of the other top three competitors decreased between 2018 and 2019.\n\nCrowdStrike was the first to identify and handle the growing security demands of the cloud age, thus it benefited from being an early entrant in the area. Furthermore, its AI-powered and machine learning-enabled solutions continue to improve in terms of threat identification and breach detection, making the solutions more effective over time. At the moment, it records 3 trillion endpoint-related events every week in real time.\n\nCrowdStrike's Weaknesses\n\nCrowdStrike's top-line growth is amazing, but the company is still unprofitable under GAAP. Its net loss increased in fiscal 2020, decreased in fiscal 2021, then almost tripled year over year to $142.4 million in the first half of 2022. This growing deficit may be ascribed to the firm's recent acquisition of Humio, a cloud-based data logging company, its high stock-based compensation expenditures (which devoured 20% of its sales in the first half of the year), and escalating R&amp;D and marketing expenses.\n\nCrowdStrike's reliance on stock incentives has increased the number of outstanding shares since its IPO, and continuous dilution may keep its values from dropping. On the plus side, CrowdStrike's non-GAAP earnings, which remove stock-based compensation and other one-time expenditures, continue to improve. It reached non-GAAP profitability in fiscal 2021 and aims to raise non-GAAP net income by 64 percent to 86 percent this year.\n\n**TLDR**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Best Company and Stock](https://preview.redd.it/rak59qmi92q71.png?width=743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c751d2f60d2be09f9abeb553b2b629815e18cd6)\n\nFull disclosure on position:\n\n15 shares @ $266.38\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cms4153a92q71.png?width=739&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0bf40100668405ead024df5cba28bc938abfacf\n\nDisclosure",

        "selftext": "Not my take but thought its worth a read.\n\nFWIW. My PFE deal prediction and structuring:\n\nPFE wants to control Europe launch, and with days away from Launch in Germany, I expect an offer near-term.\n\nIn early 2020, Yasmeen Rashimi, the analyst now at Piper (was at Roth at the time) was the only sell side analyst that valued Europe in her modeling. Her target for AMRN was $31 with $16 coming from Europe.\n\nInterestingly, the article that appeared this weekend and that has been board chatter, estimates $2.5B in peak European sales. A 3x multiple is roughly $16.\n\nSo PFE offers a 1:3 stock deal, which values AMRN at $15-$17 based on recent PFE pps.\n\nKM will not think that is enough given that he stated on the last conference call that he believes RoW revenues could be $1B (3x = $6). He also believes that USA $600M run rate is understated due to limited marketing capabilities during COVID-19 lockdown.\n\nSo PFE adds a CVR for $10 per share in cash (maybe stock) payable if/when non European revenue hits an annual run rate of $1.5B.\n\nAssuming PFE doesn\u2019t expect to hit that run rate, they are basically getting residual USA sales, Canada and China royalties, and any new RoW revenues for free.\n\nIf something changes on the USA litigation front or new V indications are approved, the peak run rate should surpass the CVR threshold, and PFE wins.\n\nWe don\u2019t know if PFE has been acquiring **shares** (obviously &lt;5% of outstanding) at \u201ccheap\u201d current levels. If so, no need to payout stock or CVR for these shares. Similarly, any shares acquired in open market by PFE, pre closure, would not require the CVR. All lowering the final deal cost for PFE.\n\nKM and insiders would approve since all their options would vest on deal closing (6 months or so?). The value of their stock would have nearly tripled from current levels, plus they have the CVR.\n\nOn announcement, AMRN stock would trade close to $15 (given arbitrage and potential optionallity of CVR). Most current shareholders would be happy with a near tripling from current price and can decide on whether to hold until closing to get the CVR.\n\nPersonally, I think the CVR would pay out within 2-3 years of deal closure as:\n\n1. a superior PFE Salesforce could grow USA revenues from current levels;\n2. as KM stated, an NDA could be approved in some countries within a 6 month timeframe. (Australia and some South American countries)\n3. a small, yet growing royalty stream in China and Canada.\n\nAnd of course the wild cards of changes from USA litigation and/or new indications for Vascepa.\n\n**My thoughts:**\n\n**I would only add another $10 to above for pill patent that prevents oxidation. That will be huge in the hands of BP.**",

        "selftext": "My fellow Apes \ud83d\udc35, get ready \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude80\n\n**$BB Patent Sale update**\n\n[https://www.iam-media.com/finance/blackberry-patent-sale-september-2021](https://www.iam-media.com/finance/blackberry-patent-sale-september-2021)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual\\_Asset\\_Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_Asset_Management)\n\n\"Nine months after IAM first broke the story of a potential sale of BlackBerry\u2019s patent portfolio, the deal to get it done may now be entering the endgame\n\nIt\u2019s almost exactly five months since BlackBerry confirmed in a press release about its Q4 and full year 2021 financials that the company was looking to sell a large section of its patent portfolio:\n\nDuring the quarter BlackBerry entered into an exclusive negotiation with a North American entity for the potential sale of part of the patent portfolio relating primarily to mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking. The Company has limited its patent monetization activities due to the ongoing negotiations. If the Company had not been in negotiations during the quarter, we believe that Licensing revenue would have been higher.\n\nThis came four months after IAM had broken the news that such a sale was being considered by the Canadian telecoms business.\n\nSince that March announcement, though, and the contents of a 10K release, there has been very little public or, indeed, private comment on the state of play in how the transaction negotiations are panning out.\n\nSo, while it was known that the possible deal was with a North American entity and involved that part of BlackBerry\u2019s 38,000-strong portfolio of patents \u201crelating primarily to non-core or legacy mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking technologies\u201d, there was no mention of a price, the stage the negotiations had reached or the identity of the possible buyer.\n\nInevitably, rumour finds its way into such a knowledge vacuum. Over recent months, IAM has heard all manner of things, including, most often of all, that the deal is going nowhere because the parties are so far apart on pricing; or, alternatively, that a deal is imminent and involves a single, big, Silicon Valley tech player, possibly Facebook.\n\nOur understanding, though, is that neither of these \u2013 or the many other stories doing the rounds \u2013 are correct. Instead, although parties close to the negotiations are staying tight-lipped, we believe that things are reaching a conclusion, to the extent that an agreement could be announced around the time BlackBerry releases its FY 2022 Q2 financials towards the end of September.\n\nThe pricing has been more or less agreed, and the numbers are material. Meanwhile, the buyer is actually a group of entities that have been negotiating without an intermediary. That has created a level of complexity around the deal structure which explains why it is taking so long to finalise.\n\nHowever, while there may be an announcement in the last week of next month, closure will take longer as the deal is going to require clearance from regulatory authorities in at least two countries: Canada and the US. If everything goes well, though, the sale will be signed, sealed and delivered by the end of this year.\n\nNote \u2013 the above is not definitive, it could be wrong in places. However, what IAM is confident in saying is that the deal is progressing, pricing is not an issue, the potential buyer is not a single company and the aim is to go public with an agreement on or around the day that BlackBerry announces its next set of financials towards the end of September.\n\nFamous last words!\"\n\n**Facebook want to use \"Blackberry Secure\" to bring WhatsApp Messenger to the Enterprise.

        "selftext": "In April 2020, ecommerce spending exploded globally. In 8 short weeks, US ecommerce spending as a % of total retail sales grew from 16% to 27%. $SHOP and $AMZN have seen their TAM grow massively and their valuations have grown to reflect this.\n\nWhat if I told you something very similar is happening right now in enterprise SaaS?\n\nAmazingly, in 2020, cloud/SaaS spending is still only 9.1% of total global IT spend. But this in changing. Spending on  cloud/SaaS is expected to grow by 18.4% in 2021 alone.\n\nMuch in the same way that the pandemic has made ecommerce a core part of any retail company\u2019s strategy, it has made SaaS a core part of every company\u2019s plans.\n\nOn-premise software just doesn\u2019t make sense in a remote-first world.\n\nJust like Amazon and Shopify have benefited from the eccommerce explosion, companies like $WDAY, $CRM, $MSFT and $OKTA will benefit from the SaaS explosion.\n\nRead more here: https://tadhg.substack.com/p/the-saas-market-opportunity-is-way",

        "selftext": "Disclosure: This is not financial advice and this is my personal opinion on the stock. You take full responsibility for your own action. \n\n# Who is CrowdStrike?\n\nCrowdStrike is a cybersecurity company that provides endpoint and workload protection solutions via its Falcon cloud-based platform. The firm is referred to as the \"Salesforce of Security\" by the CEO. Crowdstrike has benefited from the \u2018work from home' trend, which has resulted in an increase in endpoint devices and burden on the cloud, making endpoint protection critical. It competes in a highly competitive market, but it has excelled by focusing on continual client acquisition and innovation. CrowdStrike has produced outstanding results and is well-positioned to develop in the market because of its great technology.\n\nCrowdStrike is a bet on the rising need for cloud-based cybersecurity solutions. The company is a global leader in endpoint security solutions, with a growing market share. The capacity of the firm to enroll major clients, cross-sell solutions, develop new product offerings, and grow its worldwide penetration is critical to its success.\n\n# CrowdStrike Leadership Management\n\nCrowdStrike was formed in 2011 by **George Kurtz, Dmitri Alperovitch, and Gregg Marston** with the goal of developing a cloud computing security solution. They proposed the idea to Warburg Pincus, a private equity firm, and received $25 million in investment. George is still the company's CEO, although Gregg resigned in 2015 and Dmitri (previous CTO) departed in early 2020 to create a non-profit group.\n\n**George Kurtz** is the company's founder, president, and CEO. He was CTO and EVP of McAfee before starting CrowdStrike. George previously established Foundstone, a security firm that was eventually bought by McAfee in 2004. He has previously held key positions in the cybersecurity area at EY and PwC. He graduated from Seton Hall University with a B.S. in Accounting. Here's a link to a recent interview with Kurtz. As of April 2020, George owned 22.4 percent of the firm.\n\nIn February 2020, **Michael Sentonas** was appointed CTO of the business. He was formerly the company's Vice President of Technology Strategy. Prior to joining CrowdStrike, he served as McAfee's Chief Technology Officer \u2013 Security Connected and Chief Technology and Strategy Officer \u2014 APAC. He graduated from Edith Cowan University with a bachelor's degree in computer science (Australia).\n\nColin Black joined the business as CIO in 2015 and then became COO in 2017. Prior to joining CrowdStrike, he was CIO of Kratos Defense and Security Solutions, Inc. and Cymer &amp; Mindspeed Technologies, Inc. He graduated from the University of Glasgow with a B.S. in Electronics Engineering. As of April 2020, all executive officers and directors collectively owned 11% of the firm.\n\n# CrowdStrike's Endpoint Security, IT Operations and Intelligence\n\nFalcon Prevent, Falcon Insights, Falcon Device Control, and Falcon Firewall Management are all modules in this category. These modules aid in the protection against malware and fileless assaults, as well as the real-time visibility and investigation of occurrences at client endpoints and USB devices. Customers may also use solutions to design, implement, and manage firewall rules and policies.\n\nFalcon OverWatch, Falcon Discover, Falcon Complete, and Falcon Spotlight are modules that handle this section. They assist clients with detecting threats, identifying rogue apps and systems, detecting real-time vulnerability across many endpoints without scanning, and combining endpoint security with repair and response capabilities. In addition, the firm offers application licensing management, AWS expenditure analysis, and asset inventory solutions.\n\nFalcon X, Falcon Search Engine, and Falcon Sandbox are among the modules available in this market. These modules aid in the automation of threat analysis, the real-time search for malware, malware analysis, and threat research and reporting.\n\n# How does CrowdStrike make money?\n\nCustomers are paid monthly fees based on the amount of endpoints and cloud modules they utilize while utilizing CrowdStrike's Falcon platform. Customers are invoiced in advance on an annual or multi-year basis, and the agreements typically last one to three years. Subscription-based revenue accounts for over 92 percent of the company's revenue, providing great revenue predictability. Professional services, which include malware analysis, incident response, forensic, proactive, and other services, account for the remaining 8%. These are non-recurring and are billed on an hourly or fixed rate basis. The company's professional services segment assists it in cross-selling its subscription-based products.\n\nCrowdStrike paid $96 million for Preempt Security in September 2020. Preempt is a Zero Trust and restricted access technology supplier that can identify and prevent attacks in real time based on identification, behavior, and risk. This purchase would enhance the company's Zero Trust capabilities, which aid in identification and verification, enabling access to only authenticated users. Following the completion of the integration with Preempt, the firm intends to launch a new module on the Falcon platform. The United States accounts for 73% of the company's sales, EMEA accounts for 14%, Asia Pacific accounts for 8%, and other areas account for the remaining 5%.\n\nTo identify and avoid potential dangers, the firm employs AI and machine learning. As more data is available to train AI, the value proposition of the products increases with increased adoption and user base. Over time, this results in a more efficient and effective platform. Furthermore, because of the platform's cloud-native architecture, security solutions may be installed fast on an endpoint in less than 30 seconds, offering prompt deployment and protection.\n\nAccording to the company's presentation, CrowdStrike has a total addressable market of $26.9 billion, which is anticipated to increase at a CAGR of 9% to $31.9 billion by 2022. The business endpoint security industry is worth $8.1 billion. The firm has a market penetration rate of less than 3%, leaving plenty of potential for expansion. The launch of new cloud modules would increase the size of the addressable market.\n\n# Current development of the Company\n\n[WOW](https://preview.redd.it/tj8wirmj42q71.png?width=369&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce3b75bf4df80a7b728c2fbb454075f97ff396bb)\n\nCrowdStrike produced a significant topline performance as well as a bottom-line improvement in Q2 2021. It has benefited by the continuous work-from-home trend and COVID-19 shelter-in-place mandates, which have resulted in increasing workloads on the cloud and a bigger number of endpoints in an enterprise, necessitating the need for enhanced endpoint security. In fact, the business established a program to assist customers in onboarding new remote employees without jeopardizing security.\n\nOverall, it added 969 clients during the quarter, bringing the total number of consumers to 7,230, a 91 percent rise year on year. In Q2 2021, sales were $199 million, up 84 percent year on year, while subscription revenue increased by 89 percent. Subscription ARR was $791M in Q2 2021, up 87 percent year on year. This significant growth was driven by increased client acquisition throughout the quarter, as well as the sale of additional endpoints and modules to existing customers. During the quarter, 33 percent of subscription income came from new clients, while 32 percent came from the sale of additional endpoints and modules to existing customers.\n\n# CrowdStrike's Competitors\n\nCrowdStrike works in a cutthroat business with a fast-changing technical environment. It competes with BlackBerry's Cylance, VMware Carbon Black, Trend Micro, Fortinet, McAfee Endpoint Security, Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection, Avast Advanced Endpoint Protection, and other endpoint solution providers. It also competes with antivirus solution providers such as McAfee, Kaspersky, Microsoft, and others, as well as network security companies such as Palo Alto Networks and FireEye.\n\nDespite this competitive market, the company's excellent cloud-based technology has consistently generated significant revenue growth and client acquisition. According to an IDC research, it was able to quadruple its market share in the corporate endpoint category, while the market share of the other top three competitors decreased between 2018 and 2019.\n\nCrowdStrike was the first to identify and handle the growing security demands of the cloud age, thus it benefited from being an early entrant in the area. Furthermore, its AI-powered and machine learning-enabled solutions continue to improve in terms of threat identification and breach detection, making the solutions more effective over time. At the moment, it records 3 trillion endpoint-related events every week in real time.\n\n# CrowdStrike's Weaknesses\n\nCrowdStrike's top-line growth is amazing, but the company is still unprofitable under GAAP. Its net loss increased in fiscal 2020, decreased in fiscal 2021, then almost tripled year over year to $142.4 million in the first half of 2022. This growing deficit may be ascribed to the firm's recent acquisition of Humio, a cloud-based data logging company, its high stock-based compensation expenditures (which devoured 20% of its sales in the first half of the year), and escalating R&amp;D and marketing expenses.\n\nCrowdStrike's reliance on stock incentives has increased the number of outstanding shares since its IPO, and continuous dilution may keep its values from dropping. On the plus side, CrowdStrike's non-GAAP earnings, which remove stock-based compensation and other one-time expenditures, continue to improve. It reached non-GAAP profitability in fiscal 2021 and aims to raise non-GAAP net income by 64 percent to 86 percent this year.\n\n**TLDR**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Best Company and Stock](https://preview.redd.it/7y80ue2p62q71.png?width=1163&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db50592dc6f41a59967aca920e539a731a2b6b5a)\n\nFull disclosure on position:\n\n15 shares @ $266.38\n\n[Disclosure](https://preview.redd.it/pqzkgosv02q71.png?width=809&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cbf0013d3c490ae8e9aace5a4fb2316635448827)",

If the reviews are good, I'm going big in Intel. There is usually a huge lag between a reviews of CPUs/GPUs to Wallstreet reacting. For example, AMD Zen2 was going to be a massive success if you read the reviews. Wallstreet didn't react until many months later. In addition, the government will keep Intel alive no matter what because they need a domestic chip manufacturer. Lookout for a ton of government subsidies to Intel.\n\nFor Qualcomm, I'm betting that their Nuvia acquisition will allow them to move into the laptop/desktop market but it's a small bet right now. Again, I will wait for reviews of their first Nuvia product before deciding if I want to buy more because of the lag between reviews and Wallstreet reacting.\n\nSo far, I've beaten S&amp;P500 last year and this year so far.",

        "selftext": "*Disclosure: This is not financial advice and this is my personal opinion on the stock. You take full responsibility for your own action.*\n\n# Who is CrowdStrike?\n\nCrowdStrike is a cybersecurity company that provides endpoint and workload protection solutions via its Falcon cloud-based platform. The firm is referred to as the \"Salesforce of Security\" by the CEO. Crowdstrike has benefited from the \u2018work from home' trend, which has resulted in an increase in endpoint devices and burden on the cloud, making endpoint protection critical. It competes in a highly competitive market, but it has excelled by focusing on continual client acquisition and innovation. CrowdStrike has produced outstanding results and is well-positioned to develop in the market because of its great technology.\n\nCrowdStrike is a bet on the rising need for cloud-based cybersecurity solutions. The company is a global leader in endpoint security solutions, with a growing market share. The capacity of the firm to enroll major clients, cross-sell solutions, develop new product offerings, and grow its worldwide penetration is critical to its success.\n\n# CrowdStrike Leadership Management \n\nCrowdStrike was formed in 2011 by **George Kurtz, Dmitri Alperovitch, and Gregg Marston** with the goal of developing a cloud computing security solution. They proposed the idea to Warburg Pincus, a private equity firm, and received $25 million in investment. George is still the company's CEO, although Gregg resigned in 2015 and Dmitri departed in early 2020 to create a non-profit group.\n\n**George Kurtz** is the company's founder, president, and CEO. He was Chief Technical Officer of McAfee before starting CrowdStrike. George previously established Foundstone, a security firm that was eventually bought by McAfee in 2004. He has previously held key positions in the cybersecurity area at Ernst &amp; Young and PriceWaterhouseCooper. He graduated from Seton Hall University with a Science in Accounting. As of April 2020, George owned 22.4 percent of the firm.\n\nIn February 2020, **Michael Sentonas** was appointed Chief Technical officer of the business. He was formerly the company's Vice President of Technology Strategy. Prior to joining CrowdStrike, he served as McAfee's Chief Technology Officer \u2013 Security Connected and Chief Technology and Strategy Officer. He graduated from Edith Cowan University with a bachelor's degree in computer science (Australia).\n\nColin Black joined the business in 2015 and then became Chief Operating Officer in 2017. Prior to joining CrowdStrike, he was Chief investing officer of Kratos Defense and Security Solutions, Inc. and Cymer &amp; Mindspeed Technologies, Inc. He graduated from the University of Glasgow with a Science in Electronics Engineering. As of April 2020, all executive officers and directors collectively owned 11% of the firm.\n\n# CrowdStrike's Endpoint Security, IT Operations and Intelligence\n\nFalcon Prevent, Falcon Insights, Falcon Device Control, and Falcon Firewall Management are all modules in this category. These modules aid in the protection against malware and fileless assaults, as well as the real-time visibility and investigation of occurrences at client endpoints and devices. Customers may also use solutions to design, implement, and manage firewall rules and policies.\n\nFalcon OverWatch, Falcon Discover, Falcon Complete, and Falcon Spotlight are modules that handle this section. They assist clients with detecting threats, identifying rogue apps and systems, detecting real-time vulnerability across many endpoints without scanning, and combining endpoint security with repair and response capabilities. In addition, the firm offers application licensing management, Amazon Web Services expenditure analysis, and asset inventory solutions.\n\nFalcon X, Falcon Search Engine, and Falcon Sandbox are among the modules available in this market. These modules aid in the automation of threat analysis, the real-time search for malware, malware analysis, and threat research and reporting.\n\n# How does CrowdStrike make money?\n\nCustomers are paid monthly fees based on the number of endpoints and cloud modules they utilize while utilizing CrowdStrike's Falcon platform. Customers are invoiced in advance on an annual or multi-year basis, and the agreements typically last one to three years. Subscription-based revenue accounts for over 92 percent of the company's revenue, providing great revenue predictability. Professional services, which include malware analysis, incident response, forensic, proactive, and other services, account for the remaining 8%. These are non-recurring and are billed on an hourly or fixed rate basis. The company's professional services segment assists it in cross-selling its subscription-based products.\n\nCrowdStrike paid $96 million for Preempt Security in September 2020. Preempt is a Zero Trust and restricted access technology supplier that can identify and prevent attacks in real-time based on identification, behavior, and risk. This purchase would enhance the company's Zero Trust capabilities, which aid in identification and verification, enabling access to only authenticated users. Following the completion of the integration with Preempt, the firm intends to launch a new module on the Falcon platform. The United States accounts for 73% of the company's sales, Europe, Middle-East and Africa account for 14%, Asia Pacific accounts for 8%, and other areas account for the remaining 5%.\n\nTo identify and avoid potential dangers, the firm employs Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning. As more data is available to train AI, the value proposition of the products increases with increased adoption and user base. Over time, this results in a more efficient and effective platform. Furthermore, because of the platform's cloud-native architecture, security solutions may be installed fast on an endpoint in less than 30 seconds, offering prompt deployment and protection.\n\nAccording to the company's presentation, CrowdStrike has a total addressable market of $26.9 billion, which is anticipated to increase at a CAGR of 9% to $31.9 billion by 2022. The business endpoint security industry is worth $8.1 billion. The firm has a market penetration rate of less than 3%, leaving plenty of potential for expansion. The launch of new cloud modules would increase the size of the addressable market.\n\n#  Current development of the Company\n\n[WOW](https://preview.redd.it/idf5ink2b5q71.png?width=550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2c76a6199907b7f0edb2effce33784e67157f8b)\n\nCrowdStrike produced a significant topline performance as well as a bottom-line improvement in Q2 2021. It has benefited from the continuous work-from-home trend and COVID-19 shelter-in-place mandates, which have resulted in increasing workloads on the cloud and a bigger number of endpoints in an enterprise, necessitating the need for enhanced endpoint security. In fact, the business established a program to assist customers in onboarding new remote employees without jeopardizing security.\n\nOverall, it added 969 clients during the quarter, bringing the total number of consumers to 7,230, a 91 percent rise year on year. In Q2 2021, sales were $199 million, up 84 percent year on year, while subscription revenue increased by 89 percent. The subscription was $791M in Q2 2021, up 87 percent year on year. This significant growth was driven by increased client acquisition throughout the quarter, as well as the sale of additional endpoints and modules to existing customers. During the quarter, 33 percent of subscription income came from new clients, while 32 percent came from the sale of additional endpoints and modules to existing customers.\n\n# CrowdStrike's Competitors\n\nCrowdStrike works in a cutthroat business with a fast-changing technical environment. It competes with VMware Carbon Black, Trend Micro, Fortinet, McAfee Endpoint Security, Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection, Avast Advanced Endpoint Protection, and other endpoint solution providers. It also competes with antivirus solution providers such as McAfee, Kaspersky, Microsoft, and others, as well as network security companies such as Palo Alto Networks and FireEye.\n\nDespite this competitive market, the company's excellent cloud-based technology has consistently generated significant revenue growth and client acquisition. According to research, it was able to quadruple its market share in the corporate endpoint category, while the market share of the other top three competitors decreased between 2018 and 2019.\n\nCrowdStrike was the first to identify and handle the growing security demands of the cloud age, thus it benefited from being an early entrant in the area. Furthermore, its AI-powered and machine learning-enabled solutions continue to improve in terms of threat identification and breach detection, making the solutions more effective over time. At the moment, it records 3 trillion endpoint-related events every week in real-time.\n\n# CrowdStrike's Weaknesses\n\nCrowdStrike's top-line growth is amazing, but the company is still unprofitable under GAAP. Its net loss increased in fiscal 2020, decreased in fiscal 2021, then almost tripled year over year to $142.4 million in the first half of 2022. This growing deficit may be ascribed to the firm's recent acquisition of Humio, a cloud-based data logging company, its high stock-based compensation expenditures (which devoured 20% of its sales in the first half of the year), and escalating R&amp;D and marketing expenses.\n\nCrowdStrike's reliance on stock incentives has increased the number of outstanding shares since its IPO, and continuous dilution may keep its values from dropping. On the plus side, CrowdStrike's non-GAAP earnings, which remove stock-based compensation and other one-time expenditures, continue to improve. It reached non-GAAP profitability in fiscal 2021 and aims to raise non-GAAP net income by 64 percent to 86 percent this year.\n\n**TLDR**\n\n[Best Stock](https://preview.redd.it/z5jimfq8b5q71.png?width=937&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8661289be8a37483678c9b5f4df4b114d6bf9204)\n\n \n\nFull disclosure on position:\n\n15 shares @ $266.38\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zo9p1c6bb5q71.png?width=929&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f76b65f299805bff7ed3ef2dc438a98f9316f05",

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, September 28, 2021**\n\nStocks sank today, as technology stocks plummeted, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) having its worst day since March as investors nervously eye a swift rise in the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, a disappointing consumer confidence report, and power shortages in China that threaten the global supply chain as the busy Christmas season approaches, along with the evolving Evergrande situation. \n\nMarket participants continue to diest development coming out of Washington.  Congress members continue to race in order to pass legislation to fund the government until next year and prevent the government from defaulting and shutting down. This comes amid a backdrop of ongoing debates surrounding the bipartisan $1 trillion infrastructure deal. Last night, Republicans refused to pass a bill to avert a government shutdown and raise or suspend the debt limit to prevent the US from defaulting on its debts. Unfortunately, something that is fairly routine (the debt ceiling has been raised 80 times since 1960 and three times under President Trump, with the latest suspension in 2019) has become a headline with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell stating that he would not provide the Republican votes necessary.\n\nhttps://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-congress-government-funding-e7bfe8a6ffdb40a8d33e17ef11ded7a7\n\nThe benchmark 10-year Treasury yield rose to 1.54% at the time of writing, the highest level since June. Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks, like technology, the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunities to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. While higher yields are generally seen as a bet on a strengthening economic environment, it does make it more expensive to borrow capital, which weighs heavily on growth stocks, which are valued heavily based on future earnings projections.\n\nChris Beauchamp, Chief Market Analyst at IG Group, said \u201cthe prospect of higher energy prices, fueling inflation, and rises in bond yields appear to be pre-empting tighter monetary policy by central banks, have prompted widespread selling across global stock markets. Like yesterday, it is the highly-valued growth stocks that have taken the brunt of the selling, as investors fret that a lower growth, tighter policy environment will hurt these previous star performers.\u201d \n\nAccording to a report by the Conference Board, a non-profit business research organization, US consumer confidence fell to a seven-month low amid the surge in coronavirus Delta variant cases (which are finally starting to fall again), supply chain issues, and a slowdown in growth rates moving forward. The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index dropped to a reading of 109.3 this month from 115.2 in August, the third straight monthly decline. Lynne Franco, Senior Director of Economic Indicators at the Conference Board said, \u201cThese back-to-back declines suggest consumers have grown more cautious and are likely to curtail spending going forward\u201d.\n\n[https://www.conference-board.org/data/consumerconfidence.cfm](https://www.conference-board.org/data/consumerconfidence.cfm)\n\nIn other news,  a series of power cuts and even blackouts across eastern China, where most of the population lives as demand threatens to outstrip the country\u2019s electrical supply, adding a new threat to the already slowing economy and likely further snarling already disrupted global supply chains ahead of the busy Christmas season. This can already be seen in the sky-high charter rates for container ships, which have risen 10 out of the last 13 days and have more than quadrupled since the beginning of the pandemic.\n\n[https://www.tradewindsnews.com/bulkers/capesize-bulker-rates-remain-tight-amid-supply-demand-tension/2-1-1073904](https://www.tradewindsnews.com/bulkers/capesize-bulker-rates-remain-tight-amid-supply-demand-tension/2-1-1073904)\n\nThere are several reasons why electricity is in short supply. As more regions in the world reopen from pandemic-induced lockdowns, demand has skyrocketed, forcing already electricity-hungry companies to use more power. Export demand for aluminum, steel, and concrete, three of the most energy-intensive products, has been very strong domestically and abroad. Moreover, as electricity demand rises, it has pushed the price of coal, which is the main way China generates electricity, higher. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said Tuesday the Chinese government is blocking its domestic airlines from buying \"tens of billions of dollars\" in airplanes. Raimondo said in remarks after a speech in Washington that China is not abiding by commitments to buy U.S. goods it made in 2020 as part of a trade deal. \"I don't know if Boeing is here... There are tens of billions of dollars of planes that Chinese airlines want to buy but the Chinese government is standing in the way.\"\n* Disney (DIS) and Amazon (AMZN) announced they were partnering together to launch an Alexa-powered voice assistant called \u201cHey Disney\u201d which will be available at home Echo\u2019s as well as the ones located in Disney resorts and hotels\n* Netflix (NFLX) released five new mobile gaming titles to subscribers in select European markets, as the company attempts to diversify revenue sources. The company has introduced \"Stranger Things: 1984\", \"Stranger Things 3: The Game\", \"Card Blast\", \"Teeter Up\", and \"Shooting Hoops\" titles on Android to Netflix members in Spain and Italy.\n* Following a ruling by the CCP, Alibaba (BABA) and other internet companies can no longer omit competitors\u2019 products from their own platforms in an effort to increase competition. As a result, Alibaba has now added rival Tencent (TCEHY) WeChat payment system in some of its platforms. \n* According to a joint report by consulting firms JD Power and LMC Automotive, new vehicle sales in the US are expected to fall a staggering 25% compared to last year, just the latest example of the effect the global shortage in semiconductors is having in the automotive industry. New-vehicle retail sales in the United States are seen dropping to 888,900 units in September, from 1,182,788 a year ago.\n* Ford Motor Co and its Korean battery partner SK Innovation will invest $11.4 billion to build an electric F-150 assembly plant and three battery plants in the United States, accelerating the U.S. automaker's push into electric vehicles.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Costco (COST) target raised by Citigroup from $460 to $495 at Neutral.

Consensus economists were looking for a 0.7% drop. \n\nA few days ago, China\u2019s retail sales report showed a dramatic slowdown in growth as the country battles rising coronavirus cases and seasonal floodings, with output and sales reaching a one-year low. Consumer spending grew 2.5% in the month of August, a sharp deceleration from the 8.5% growth in July and missing estimates of 7% growth. Industrial production rose 5.3% in August from a year earlier, narrowing from an increase of 6.4% in July and marking the weakest pace since July 2020, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday.

        "selftext": "*Disclosure: This is not financial advice and this is my personal opinion on the stock. You take full responsibility for your own action.*\n\n# Who is CrowdStrike?\n\nCrowdStrike is a cybersecurity company that provides endpoint and workload protection solutions via its Falcon cloud-based platform. The firm is referred to as the \"Salesforce of Security\" by the CEO. Crowdstrike has benefited from the \u2018work from home' trend, which has resulted in an increase in endpoint devices and burden on the cloud, making endpoint protection critical. It competes in a highly competitive market, but it has excelled by focusing on continual client acquisition and innovation. CrowdStrike has produced outstanding results and is well-positioned to develop in the market because of its great technology.\n\nCrowdStrike is a bet on the rising need for cloud-based cybersecurity solutions. The company is a global leader in endpoint security solutions, with a growing market share. The capacity of the firm to enroll major clients, cross-sell solutions, develop new product offerings, and grow its worldwide penetration is critical to its success.\n\n# CrowdStrike Leadership Management\n\nCrowdStrike was formed in 2011 by **George Kurtz, Dmitri Alperovitch, and Gregg Marston** with the goal of developing a cloud computing security solution. They proposed the idea to Warburg Pincus, a private equity firm, and received $25 million in investment. George is still the company's CEO, although Gregg resigned in 2015 and Dmitri departed in early 2020 to create a non-profit group.\n\n**George Kurtz** is the company's founder, president, and CEO. He was Chief Technical Officer of McAfee before starting CrowdStrike. George previously established Foundstone, a security firm that was eventually bought by McAfee in 2004. He has previously held key positions in the cybersecurity area at Ernst &amp; Young and PriceWaterhouseCooper. He graduated from Seton Hall University with a Science in Accounting. As of April 2020, George owned 22.4 percent of the firm.\n\nIn February 2020, **Michael Sentonas** was appointed Chief Technical officer of the business. He was formerly the company's Vice President of Technology Strategy. Prior to joining CrowdStrike, he served as McAfee's Chief Technology Officer \u2013 Security Connected and Chief Technology and Strategy Officer. He graduated from Edith Cowan University with a bachelor's degree in computer science (Australia).\n\nColin Black joined the business in 2015 and then became Chief Operating Officer in 2017. Prior to joining CrowdStrike, he was Chief investing officer of Kratos Defense and Security Solutions, Inc. and Cymer &amp; Mindspeed Technologies, Inc. He graduated from the University of Glasgow with a Science in Electronics Engineering. As of April 2020, all executive officers and directors collectively owned 11% of the firm.\n\n# CrowdStrike's Endpoint Security, IT Operations and Intelligence\n\nFalcon Prevent, Falcon Insights, Falcon Device Control, and Falcon Firewall Management are all modules in this category. These modules aid in the protection against malware and fileless assaults, as well as the real-time visibility and investigation of occurrences at client endpoints and devices. Customers may also use solutions to design, implement, and manage firewall rules and policies.\n\nFalcon OverWatch, Falcon Discover, Falcon Complete, and Falcon Spotlight are modules that handle this section. They assist clients with detecting threats, identifying rogue apps and systems, detecting real-time vulnerability across many endpoints without scanning, and combining endpoint security with repair and response capabilities. In addition, the firm offers application licensing management, Amazon Web Services expenditure analysis, and asset inventory solutions.\n\nFalcon X, Falcon Search Engine, and Falcon Sandbox are among the modules available in this market. These modules aid in the automation of threat analysis, the real-time search for malware, malware analysis, and threat research and reporting.\n\n# How does CrowdStrike make money?\n\nCustomers are paid monthly fees based on the number of endpoints and cloud modules they utilize while utilizing CrowdStrike's Falcon platform. Customers are invoiced in advance on an annual or multi-year basis, and the agreements typically last one to three years. Subscription-based revenue accounts for over 92 percent of the company's revenue, providing great revenue predictability. Professional services, which include malware analysis, incident response, forensic, proactive, and other services, account for the remaining 8%. These are non-recurring and are billed on an hourly or fixed rate basis. The company's professional services segment assists it in cross-selling its subscription-based products.\n\nCrowdStrike paid $96 million for Preempt Security in September 2020. Preempt is a Zero Trust and restricted access technology supplier that can identify and prevent attacks in real-time based on identification, behavior, and risk. This purchase would enhance the company's Zero Trust capabilities, which aid in identification and verification, enabling access to only authenticated users. Following the completion of the integration with Preempt, the firm intends to launch a new module on the Falcon platform. The United States accounts for 73% of the company's sales, Europe, Middle-East and Africa account for 14%, Asia Pacific accounts for 8%, and other areas account for the remaining 5%.\n\nTo identify and avoid potential dangers, the firm employs Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning. As more data is available to train AI, the value proposition of the products increases with increased adoption and user base. Over time, this results in a more efficient and effective platform. Furthermore, because of the platform's cloud-native architecture, security solutions may be installed fast on an endpoint in less than 30 seconds, offering prompt deployment and protection.\n\nAccording to the company's presentation, CrowdStrike has a total addressable market of $26.9 billion, which is anticipated to increase at a CAGR of 9% to $31.9 billion by 2022. The business endpoint security industry is worth $8.1 billion. The firm has a market penetration rate of less than 3%, leaving plenty of potential for expansion. The launch of new cloud modules would increase the size of the addressable market.\n\n# Current development of the Company\n\nCrowdStrike produced a significant topline performance as well as a bottom-line improvement in Q2 2021. It has benefited from the continuous work-from-home trend and COVID-19 shelter-in-place mandates, which have resulted in increasing workloads on the cloud and a bigger number of endpoints in an enterprise, necessitating the need for enhanced endpoint security. In fact, the business established a program to assist customers in onboarding new remote employees without jeopardizing security.\n\nOverall, it added 969 clients during the quarter, bringing the total number of consumers to 7,230, a 91 percent rise year on year. In Q2 2021, sales were $199 million, up 84 percent year on year, while subscription revenue increased by 89 percent. The subscription was $791M in Q2 2021, up 87 percent year on year. This significant growth was driven by increased client acquisition throughout the quarter, as well as the sale of additional endpoints and modules to existing customers. During the quarter, 33 percent of subscription income came from new clients, while 32 percent came from the sale of additional endpoints and modules to existing customers.\n\n# CrowdStrike's Competitors\n\nCrowdStrike works in a cutthroat business with a fast-changing technical environment. It competes with VMware Carbon Black, Trend Micro, Fortinet, McAfee Endpoint Security, Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection, Avast Advanced Endpoint Protection, and other endpoint solution providers. It also competes with antivirus solution providers such as McAfee, Kaspersky, Microsoft, and others, as well as network security companies such as Palo Alto Networks and FireEye.\n\nDespite this competitive market, the company's excellent cloud-based technology has consistently generated significant revenue growth and client acquisition. According to research, it was able to quadruple its market share in the corporate endpoint category, while the market share of the other top three competitors decreased between 2018 and 2019.\n\nCrowdStrike was the first to identify and handle the growing security demands of the cloud age, thus it benefited from being an early entrant in the area. Furthermore, its AI-powered and machine learning-enabled solutions continue to improve in terms of threat identification and breach detection, making the solutions more effective over time. At the moment, it records 3 trillion endpoint-related events every week in real-time.\n\n# CrowdStrike's Weaknesses\n\nCrowdStrike's top-line growth is amazing, but the company is still unprofitable under GAAP. Its net loss increased in fiscal 2020, decreased in fiscal 2021, then almost tripled year over year to $142.4 million in the first half of 2022. This growing deficit may be ascribed to the firm's recent acquisition of Humio, a cloud-based data logging company, its high stock-based compensation expenditures (which devoured 20% of its sales in the first half of the year), and escalating R&amp;D and marketing expenses.\n\nCrowdStrike's reliance on stock incentives has increased the number of outstanding shares since its IPO, and continuous dilution may keep its values from dropping. On the plus side, CrowdStrike's non-GAAP earnings, which remove stock-based compensation and other one-time expenditures, continue to improve. It reached non-GAAP profitability in fiscal 2021 and aims to raise non-GAAP net income by 64 percent to 86 percent this year.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nBest Stock\n\nFull disclosure on position:\n\n15 shares @ $266.38",

He has previously held key positions in the cybersecurity area at EY and PwC. He graduated from Seton Hall University with a B.S. in Accounting. Here's a link to a recent interview with Kurtz. As of April 2020, George owned 22.4 percent of the firm.\n\nIn February 2020, **Michael Sentonas** was appointed CTO of the business. He was formerly the company's Vice President of Technology Strategy. Prior to joining CrowdStrike, he served as McAfee's Chief Technology Officer \u2013 Security Connected and Chief Technology and Strategy Officer \u2014 APAC. He graduated from Edith Cowan University with a bachelor's degree in computer science (Australia).\n\nColin Black joined the business as CIO in 2015 and then became COO in 2017. Prior to joining CrowdStrike, he was CIO of Kratos Defense and Security Solutions, Inc. and Cymer &amp; Mindspeed Technologies, Inc. He graduated from the University of Glasgow with a B.S. in Electronics Engineering. As of April 2020, all executive officers and directors collectively owned 11% of the firm.\n\nCrowdStrike's Endpoint Security, IT Operations and Intelligence\n\nFalcon Prevent, Falcon Insights, Falcon Device Control, and Falcon Firewall Management are all modules in this category. These modules aid in the protection against malware and fileless assaults, as well as the real-time visibility and investigation of occurrences at client endpoints and USB devices. Customers may also use solutions to design, implement, and manage firewall rules and policies.\n\nFalcon OverWatch, Falcon Discover, Falcon Complete, and Falcon Spotlight are modules that handle this section. They assist clients with detecting threats, identifying rogue apps and systems, detecting real-time vulnerability across many endpoints without scanning, and combining endpoint security with repair and response capabilities. In addition, the firm offers application licensing management, AWS expenditure analysis, and asset inventory solutions.\n\nFalcon X, Falcon Search Engine, and Falcon Sandbox are among the modules available in this market. These modules aid in the automation of threat analysis, the real-time search for malware, malware analysis, and threat research and reporting.\n\nHow does CrowdStrike make money?\n\nCustomers are paid monthly fees based on the amount of endpoints and cloud modules they utilize while utilizing CrowdStrike's Falcon platform. Customers are invoiced in advance on an annual or multi-year basis, and the agreements typically last one to three years. Subscription-based revenue accounts for over 92 percent of the company's revenue, providing great revenue predictability. Professional services, which include malware analysis, incident response, forensic, proactive, and other services, account for the remaining 8%. These are non-recurring and are billed on an hourly or fixed rate basis. The company's professional services segment assists it in cross-selling its subscription-based products.\n\nCrowdStrike paid $96 million for Preempt Security in September 2020. Preempt is a Zero Trust and restricted access technology supplier that can identify and prevent attacks in real time based on identification, behavior, and risk. This purchase would enhance the company's Zero Trust capabilities, which aid in identification and verification, enabling access to only authenticated users. Following the completion of the integration with Preempt, the firm intends to launch a new module on the Falcon platform. The United States accounts for 73% of the company's sales, EMEA accounts for 14%, Asia Pacific accounts for 8%, and other areas account for the remaining 5%.\n\nTo identify and avoid potential dangers, the firm employs AI and machine learning. As more data is available to train AI, the value proposition of the products increases with increased adoption and user base. Over time, this results in a more efficient and effective platform. Furthermore, because of the platform's cloud-native architecture, security solutions may be installed fast on an endpoint in less than 30 seconds, offering prompt deployment and protection.\n\nAccording to the company's presentation, CrowdStrike has a total addressable market of $26.9 billion, which is anticipated to increase at a CAGR of 9% to $31.9 billion by 2022. The business endpoint security industry is worth $8.1 billion. The firm has a market penetration rate of less than 3%, leaving plenty of potential for expansion. The launch of new cloud modules would increase the size of the addressable market.\n\nCurrent development of the Company\ud83d\udcf7\n\n[wow](https://preview.redd.it/0bw7h5zl92q71.png?width=398&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6fa82ab01df3abad49c2648616b8e5f42df3d64)\n\nCrowdStrike produced a significant topline performance as well as a bottom-line improvement in Q2 2021. It has benefited by the continuous work-from-home trend and COVID-19 shelter-in-place mandates, which have resulted in increasing workloads on the cloud and a bigger number of endpoints in an enterprise, necessitating the need for enhanced endpoint security. In fact, the business established a program to assist customers in onboarding new remote employees without jeopardizing security.\n\nOverall, it added 969 clients during the quarter, bringing the total number of consumers to 7,230, a 91 percent rise year on year. In Q2 2021, sales were $199 million, up 84 percent year on year, while subscription revenue increased by 89 percent. Subscription ARR was $791M in Q2 2021, up 87 percent year on year. This significant growth was driven by increased client acquisition throughout the quarter, as well as the sale of additional endpoints and modules to existing customers. During the quarter, 33 percent of subscription income came from new clients, while 32 percent came from the sale of additional endpoints and modules to existing customers.\n\nCrowdStrike's Competitors\n\nCrowdStrike works in a cutthroat business with a fast-changing technical environment. It competes with BlackBerry's Cylance, VMware Carbon Black, Trend Micro, Fortinet, McAfee Endpoint Security, Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection, Avast Advanced Endpoint Protection, and other endpoint solution providers. It also competes with antivirus solution providers such as McAfee, Kaspersky, Microsoft, and others, as well as network security companies such as Palo Alto Networks and FireEye.\n\nDespite this competitive market, the company's excellent cloud-based technology has consistently generated significant revenue growth and client acquisition. According to an IDC research, it was able to quadruple its market share in the corporate endpoint category, while the market share of the other top three competitors decreased between 2018 and 2019.\n\nCrowdStrike was the first to identify and handle the growing security demands of the cloud age, thus it benefited from being an early entrant in the area. Furthermore, its AI-powered and machine learning-enabled solutions continue to improve in terms of threat identification and breach detection, making the solutions more effective over time. At the moment, it records 3 trillion endpoint-related events every week in real time.\n\nCrowdStrike's Weaknesses\n\nCrowdStrike's top-line growth is amazing, but the company is still unprofitable under GAAP. Its net loss increased in fiscal 2020, decreased in fiscal 2021, then almost tripled year over year to $142.4 million in the first half of 2022. This growing deficit may be ascribed to the firm's recent acquisition of Humio, a cloud-based data logging company, its high stock-based compensation expenditures (which devoured 20% of its sales in the first half of the year), and escalating R&amp;D and marketing expenses.\n\nCrowdStrike's reliance on stock incentives has increased the number of outstanding shares since its IPO, and continuous dilution may keep its values from dropping. On the plus side, CrowdStrike's non-GAAP earnings, which remove stock-based compensation and other one-time expenditures, continue to improve. It reached non-GAAP profitability in fiscal 2021 and aims to raise non-GAAP net income by 64 percent to 86 percent this year.\n\n**TLDR**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Best Company and Stock](https://preview.redd.it/rak59qmi92q71.png?width=743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c751d2f60d2be09f9abeb553b2b629815e18cd6)\n\nFull disclosure on position:\n\n15 shares @ $266.38\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cms4153a92q71.png?width=739&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0bf40100668405ead024df5cba28bc938abfacf\n\nDisclosure",

        "selftext": "Disclosure: This is not financial advice and this is my personal opinion on the stock. You take full responsibility for your own action. \n\n# Who is CrowdStrike?\n\nCrowdStrike is a cybersecurity company that provides endpoint and workload protection solutions via its Falcon cloud-based platform. The firm is referred to as the \"Salesforce of Security\" by the CEO. Crowdstrike has benefited from the \u2018work from home' trend, which has resulted in an increase in endpoint devices and burden on the cloud, making endpoint protection critical. It competes in a highly competitive market, but it has excelled by focusing on continual client acquisition and innovation. CrowdStrike has produced outstanding results and is well-positioned to develop in the market because of its great technology.\n\nCrowdStrike is a bet on the rising need for cloud-based cybersecurity solutions. The company is a global leader in endpoint security solutions, with a growing market share. The capacity of the firm to enroll major clients, cross-sell solutions, develop new product offerings, and grow its worldwide penetration is critical to its success.\n\n# CrowdStrike Leadership Management\n\nCrowdStrike was formed in 2011 by **George Kurtz, Dmitri Alperovitch, and Gregg Marston** with the goal of developing a cloud computing security solution. They proposed the idea to Warburg Pincus, a private equity firm, and received $25 million in investment.

In the long term always seems to keep up with the pace of new tech and has solid workforce and at least since they dropped Bannon, management is on point\n\nAMZN- Absolute monster. Hard to not want it in my line up. They will continue to grow and buy up/absorb new tech and not afraid to buy up the little guy to increase their market share.\n\nAMD- I like them for the fact that their tech has been setting the bar as of late. While Intel or Nvidia might be bigger and have more market share, i think AMD has more potential over a long term.\n\nHD- I like the grasp on the non tech market they have. They do well during economic growth. They sustain during economic lulls. And even though I'm a Lowes guy, they are the workhorse in household consumer goods and building materials.\n\nBA- Chose this over an airline because it moves with the same news, but is tied in closely with US Military spending and  will sustain over times of peace and war.\n\nNote: Honestly i invest 70ish% in funds. And only about 25% of my portfolio is in blue chips. But thought it'd be fun to see what people choose and they're reasoning.",

        "selftext": "Companies which operate in duopolies often have wide moats which deliver good financial performance because they're less susceptible to new entrants, often due to high barriers to entry. Many industries also mature to the point where it's only profitable for a handful of companies to operate, which can be profitable for those which survive. For an example, look at the memory semiconductor manufacturing industry. Lots of consolidation over the past two years like Intel selling its NAND business to SK Hynix and Western Digital buying Kioxia. \n\nMy question is, what are some duopolies in relatively attractive industries? Regardless of market cap. I'll start: \n\n$V and $MA: one of the first duopolies many people think of, the two companies with a solid grip on the payment processing space. Have been some worries about new technology/entrants as of late but the chart for these companies tells the story. \n\n$WM and $RSG: waste management is a highly fragmented industry but these two companies have come out on top after Republic Services (the 3rd largest at the time) bought Allied Waste (2nd largest) in 2008. Many think of garbage disposal as a boring, defensive industry akin to utilities, but both stocks are up 150% in five years (good but not great) with a 1.5% dividend, good management and should (theoretically) offer decent downside protection in an economic downturn. \n\nSemiconductor capital equipment: not listing individual stocks because the entire industry is a series of duopolies between $ASM, $LRCX, $AMAT, $TOELY, and $KLAC. The technology is so damn hard and expensive to develop that the market has been whittled down to these five companies supplying most equipment for fabricating semiconductors, charts speak for themselves. \n\nWhat are some other ideas on duopolies? Open to any feedback on this strategy as well.",

I am going to snag his work and put it here for all you apes to adore, and believe the hype!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*&lt;begin\\_plagiarism&gt;*\n\nLucid is an EV manufacturer based out of Newark, California. They were founded in 2007 as Atieva and initially focused on producing battery modules and powertrains for other manufacturers. Since their inception they have been awarded over 325 patents, 50 of which pertain directly to their core battery system in the US alone\\*.\n\nIn 2013 Lucid enlisted the help of now-CEO/CTO Peter Rawlinson. Prior to this Peter was VP of Vehicle Engineering and chief engineer at Tesla helping to develop the Model S. Around this time Lucid was developing a 900 hp powertrain under the *Edna* test bed (basically a stripped dow utility van). In 2016 the company officially rebranded to Lucid Motors and revealed the earliest Lucid Air alpha prototype at the LA motor show.\n\nIn 2019 they broke ground on their Advanced Manufacturing Plant-1 (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona, the first purpose-built EV factory in the United States. The current factory is over 999k square feet with an additional 5.1 million square feet of building space planned on the 590-acre site\\*. Recently over $350 million in CAPEX for 2021-2023 was brought forward to combine phases 2 and 3 of the AMP factory into one combined phase\\*, with early construction already having begun\\*. Once complete the total manufacturing output will be up to 400k vehicles per year, and eventually upgradeable to &gt; 500k vehicles per year. Lucid also has a powertrain factory (Lucid Manufacturing Plant-1, LMP-1) located 6 miles from AMP-1 where they manufacture all their battery modules, packs, inverters, drive units and wunderboxes\\*.\n\nLucid aims to outcompete Tesla and other EV manufacturers on the basis of their technology, stating competition between Lucid and Tesla will be a \"two horse race.\"\\* In brief, the Lucid Air claims 1080 horsepower and 517 miles of range on the most energy dense powertrain to date. They offer a drag coefficient of 0.21\\*, bested only by the Mercedes EQS. They are looking to compete in the luxury EV sector with an eye for what they term as \"post-luxury,\" emphasizing sustainability and user experience over opulence\\*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9yj8bmpuzyp71.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0a6f9f941f2dbfc78063d5256fccdab29a04b84\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **TIMELINE** (picture version):\n\n* 2007 \u2013 Atieva founded (info)\n* Nov 2014 \u2013 ATVUS model first shown (pre-Derek Jenkins) (article)\n* July 2015 \u2013 Edna Atieva powertrain test car (video)\n* Nov 2015 - Atieva officially renamed Lucid Motors (article)\n* Dec 2015 - ATVUS redesign to Lucid Air begins\n* Aug 2016 - DIA award Formula E battery to Atieva (article)\n* Nov 2016 - Alpha fleet revealed at LA motor show (video)\n* Apr 2017 - NY Auto Show - first public display of the Air (video)\n* July 2017 - 235 mile/hour speed run record (video)\n* Aug 2017 - Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance (video)\n* Dec 2017 - Design moves into Ardenwood; Engineering move to temporary offices\n* Sept 2018 - Series D investment (PIF major funding) (article, press release)\n* Oct 2018 - Lucid announce agreement with Electrify America providing access to ultra-fast charging network (article)\n* Feb 2019 - Move to Gateway BLVD HQ in Newark, CA (video)\n* Apr 2019 - Peter Rawlinson (CTO) promoted to CEO (press release)\n* Dec 2019 - Breaking ground on Arizona AMP-1 factory (article)\n* Dec 2019 - Beta 2 fleet begin testing (video)\n* Feb 2020 - Lucid forges long-term cell partnership with LG Chem (article, press release)\n* Sept 2020 - Lucid Air makes fastest lap time at Laguna Seca (article)\n* Sept 2020 - 9/9 Event, official launch of Lucid Air\n* Oct 2020 - First studio opes in Beverly Hills, CA (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Awarded Formula E Gen3 Lucid front powertrain (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Bloomberg publishes C\\*\\*\\* rumor (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Michael Klein fireside chat with IPO Edge - SPAC rumors begin (video)\n* Feb 2021 - C\\*\\*\\*-Lucid Definitive Agreement.

Conceptually, every electric motor can be broken down into two primary components: the *stator* (outer housing) and the *rotor* (internal component). When an electric current is applied to coils lining the stator it generates a magnetic field, and when this current is phased the magnetic field begins to rotate. Magnets on the rotor are attracted to the rotating magnetic field causing the axle to rotate, thereby creating torque. As stated earlier these rotor magnets can be permanent (like Lucid and now Tesla) or electromagnetic. The latter is less efficient because it requires more wire \u2192 more resistance \u2192 more heat \u2192 decreased efficiency. By getting rid of that wire the permanent magnet motor takes up significantly less space and allows you to combine the inverter, transmission, differential and motor into a single smaller package. In Lucid's case this brings the weight of the entire assembly down to just 164 pounds. In conjunction with a proprietary cooling mechanism (axial jet cooling manifold) and a significant decrease to cogging torque this has allowed Lucid to create ***the most power-dense drive unit on the market*** at over 9 hp/kg (compared to Tesla's 3.2 hp/kg). That's ***280% more energy-dense than the nearest competitor.***\n\nLucid's highly efficient motor can deliver up to 670 hp and 2950 lb-ft of torque. The all-wheel-drive Air has two motors and delivers as much as 1,080 total hp with a 0-60-mph time of 2.5 seconds\\*. Check out the timeline above to see videos of their speed records.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o1stpusvzyp71.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb7eff1951a48874c28474791856d75dea6120ba\n\n***Battery***: Any manufacturer can add more batteries to an EV and increase its range, but this only increases weight and does nothing to improve efficiency (\"dumb range\"). To this end Lucid has been working to maximize its battery efficiency for almost 14 years. One of the most important parts of this is their adoption of a **900+ volt architecture**, the highest in the industry. Why does this matter? Because for the same amount of power a higher voltage system allows you to use lower current (V=IR). Lower current means less heat generated and therefore less total losses. This is based on the I2R principle, where if you x2 your current you x4 your losses. For comparison, Tesla utilizes a 350 volt architecture and would have to nearly triple the current to deliver the same amount of power as Lucid. Since Lucid uses lower currents they can use smaller cables, less wires and therefore less material mass while increasing the vehicle's efficiency. Lucid uses a total of 22 battery modules to make a complete pack, with each module producing around 42 volts for a total of 924 volts, in a package weighing around 1100 pounds total. Each module produces 5.1 kWh and with 22 of them it comes out to **113 kWh total**. This gives the Air an estimated **517 miles total range** (*EPA verification pending*) with an **efficiency of 4.6 miles/kWh**. This is the most efficient battery pack on the market, with Tesla following behind at 4.0 miles/kWh and other manufacturers even further behind still. Peter Rawlinson has stated in 2-3 years 4.8 miles/kWh is achievable, and up to 6.0 miles/kWh in a smaller vehicle format (future Lucid coupe?)\\*:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/izejluexzyp71.png?width=2155&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba9252ec9a4efe2cb550b385fa9c38099419f025\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lhio20z00zp71.png?width=2191&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd5baa49a33a130763584fdb952fc85abc95bf32\n\nHigher volt architecture also allows the battery pack to be charged more rapidly than Lucid's competitors at up to 300kW, gaining nearly **300 miles of range in just 20 minutes**. For comparison the Porsche Taycan has previously *advertised* up to 350 kW charging but their own website now only reports only up to 270kW\\*. The Tesla Model S Plaid offers up to 250 kW\\*.\n\nFor battery chemistry Lucid has a contract with LG Chem to be their exclusive battery cell supplier\\*. While the 2170-format cells are similar to those used by other EV manufacturers, Peter Rawlinson has stated that manufacturing a battery pack is 85% mechanical and only 15% chemistry. One innovative feature of Lucid's battery packs is utilization of end-cooling as opposed to side-cooling (like Tesla)\\*. Not only is this more efficient it allows them to pack individual cells more tightly and to better optimize total energy density.\n\nIt should also be noted that Lucid has supplied all the battery packs for Formula E racing since 2018 using the 18650-format cells\\*. This same technology powering Formula E will be driving you to KFC for the 4th time this week.\n\nSome have argued that 517 miles of range is irrelevant if you're only driving to and from work every day, however keep in mind increased range does not simply imply longer individual trips\u2014it also means less frequent charging. EV adoption has historically been tempered by *range anxiety*\u2014the fear of running out of charge during a long trip. This type of range significantly decreases that anxiety and offers greater mobility than almost any commercial ICE sedan.\n\n***Wunderbox***: Lucid calls this the heart of their electrical platform\\*. It allows compatibility with\u2014and the maximizing of\u2014charging systems of differing voltages, specifically boost-voltage charging. It enables a wide array of future-ready bi-directional power delivery features. These include vehicle-to-grid (V2G) compatibility for situations such as managing home power outages as well as vehicle-to-vehicle charging (V2V).\n\n***Dream Drive***: This is Lucid's Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS). It's made up of 32 total sensors including ultrasonic, radar and an industry-first high-definition LIDAR system. There is also an internal camera system for driver monitoring and can take over in difficult situations. The Dream Drive system will be updated over the air and will deliver level 2 driving at launch. Level 3 driver assistance and geo-fenced HD mapping will be updated OTA shortly thereafter. For comparison Tesla has admitted their \"Full Self-Driving\" system is still level 2 under the definition of US authorities\\*. Nevertheless, I don't believe Lucid's intent here is to be the industry leader, and Peter Rawlinson has stated that true autonomous driving (levels 4-5) is still many years away. More information is available on Lucid's website\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **VEHICLES AND TRIMS:**\n\n**Air sedan**: Lucid will start by offering the Air Dream Edition beginning this year (2021), with three additional trims being released sequentially over the next couple years. The Dream Edition is their top-of-the-line model and starts at a price of $161,500 (*after $7,500 tax credit in the US\\**). Future models step down in price to the $69,900 Air Pure. Each are compared in the following image:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/usm8geczzyp71.png?width=2452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fffdc7aaae1f913ab3a9400a1133ad1212c0644\n\n\\*US tax credits are on the fence with the infrastructure bill right now\\*\n\n**Gravity SUV**: \"Project Gravity\" will be Lucid's entry into the lucrative SUV market\\*. Prototypes have already been built\\* using Lucid's Electric Advanced Platform (LEAP), the same modular platform upon which the Air is manufactured. Accordingly it should offer fairly similar specifications to that of its sedan sibling. The body will be a little wider than the Air but a good bit taller, seating up to 7 passengers. Production is expected to begin in 2H 2023.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j8imlj130zp71.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=210716737bce8e989efa725e986cdb45e242ac1c\n\nProject Gravity SUV\n\n**Additional vehicles:** Lucid has future plans for an additional coupe and pickup truck by 2030\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **CHARGING:**\n\nCharging will be on the basis of Lucid-branded EV supply equipment as well as outside partnerships\\*. Lucid's own equipment will supply AC charging at 10-20 kW using their standard portable EV Supply Equipment (EVSE) versus an optional wall mount through an official Lucid-Installation partner, QMerit or an electrician of the customer's choice. Lucid community partnerships will be capable of AC charging up to \\~20kW and DC charging up to \\~300kW. *Every vehicle sold will come with three years of free charging through an Electrify America*, and will be compatible with networks leveraging J1772 and CCS charging standards such as ChargePoint and EVgo\\*.\n\nTesla's supercharger network has first-mover advantage but is highly capital intensive and limited to a legacy 400V maximum architecture, charging at 250 kW with the latest V3 units. Lucid's partnership with Electrify America is a much more CAPEX-light alternative and is compatible with 900V second-generation systems, charging at a maximum of 350 kW. It also uses the open-source CSS connector as apposed to Tesla's closed-source system.\n\nModern EVs are migrating to ultra high voltage architectures, eg, Porsche at 800V, Lucid at over 900V. Tesla systems and vehicles adopted 400V largely as a consequence of earlier technology.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**\u25b6 PEOPLE:**\n\nLucid has collected an impressive roster of executive leadership, many of which with resum\u00e9s from some of Silicon Valley's most sought-after brands. An abbreviated biography is provided below, however the take-home point is the pedigree from which Lucid draws its talent. Companies such as **Apple, Intel, Waymo, Tesla, Audi, Ferrari** and **Ford** are represented and this positions Lucid well in terms of technical expertise and networking.\n\n**Peter Rawlinson** (CEO/CTO) - Born in South Wales, UK. Studied Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College London before graduating in 1979\\*. Prior to Lucid he gathered over 30 years experience between being the Principal Engineer at Lotus Cars, Head of Vehicle Engineering at Corus Automotive and VP of Vehicle Engineering at Tesla (Sept 2009 - Jan 2012)\\*. At Tesla he was the chief engineer of the Model S, responsible for its technical execution and delivery by improving both its structure and production\\*. Peter would later join Atieva in 2013 as their Chief Technology Officer (CTO) before being promoted to CEO in 2019\\*. Elon Musk has publicly tried to downplay Peter's role at Lucid via Twitter\\*; however, this has been thoroughly verified and refuted\\*.\n\n**Sherry House** (CFO) - Sherry joined Lucid Motors as Chief Financial Officer in May 2021\\*. Prior to Lucid she was Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations at Waymo LLC, an autonomous driving technology company and subsidiary of Alphabet Inc (Google)\\*. She worked to guide the company's investments, acquisitions and external fundraising. She has an engineering background with BAs in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Engineering, as well as an MBA and Masters of Manufacturing and Engineering.\n\n**Derek Jenkins** (Senior VP or Design and Brand) - Derek currently oversees all design developments including exterior and interior design, user experience, color and material, accessories and design strategy\\*. Before joining Lucid he was the Director of Design at Mazda North America Operations where he oversaw all design developments both locally and globally\\*. Prior to Mazda he was the Chief Designer for Volkswagen North America for 9 years, and was a designer for Audi in both Germany and the United States for eight years.\n\n**Eric Bach** (Senior VP of Product and Chief Engineer) - Eric has guided numerous vehicles to market for both Volkswagen AG and Tesla Motors\\*. At Tesla he oversaw several engineering functions for the Model S, Model X, and Model 3 programs. Under his leadership his teams successfully enabled the Model S and Model X programs to deliver pioneering engineering and technology solutions under vastly accelerated timelines when compared to the industry at large.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/blka49d40zp71.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8f1fb4ca97e2736af6a8c83c96c984716f1c3e2\n\nBesides executive positions Lucid currently employs over 2,000 people and has a 4.2 out of 5 score on Glassdoor.com\\*. There are currently 900+ job postings on their website indicating that they are growing very rapidly\\*, expecting more than 4000 total employees by next year\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **MARKET OPPORTUNITY:**\n\n**General EV market**: EV adoption is still very early. To draw an analogy, the growth of ICE automobiles per 1,000 people between 1900 and 1909 has a very strong correlation coefficient (98%) with the current growth of EVs between 2011 through 2020\\*. This growth will almost certainly continue due to multiple factors, including supportive government policies and regulations promoting EV adoption, increasing investments from OEMs, rising environmental concerns and the decreasing cost of batteries. Keeping this in mind EVs are in a strong position to cannibalize the $5 trillion automobile market, and there's little debate over long-term industry growth. We are only at the beginning of what looks to be a parabolic growth curve, and time in the market will almost certainly beat timing the market.\n\n**Luxury vehicle market**: In 2020 the EV market comprised 5% of all new car sales. Lucid is specifically targeting the luxury EV market which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5%, from $496 billion in 2018 to $742 billion in 2026.\n\n**Total addressable market (TAM)**: For 2021-2022 Lucid anticipates the Air model to represent 2% of the total addressable EV market (*this number may change based on current commodities and chip markets*). By 2030 they estimate a run-rate production of &gt;500k vehicles, representing an estimated 4% of total market share.\n\n**Production volume**: Production is underway at Lucid\u2019s custom-built Advanced Manufacturing Plant (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona with deliveries starting in the next few months (2H 2021). Lucid will start by selling various trims of the model Air (see above), however Project Gravity (2023) and future models (2025+) will contribute to future production estimates as outlined below:\n\n* 2021 - 577 vehicles\n* 2022 \u2013 20,000 vehicles\n* 2023 \u2013 49,000 vehicles\n* 2024 \u2013 90,000 vehicles\n* 2025 \u2013 135,000 vehicles\n* 2026 \u2013 251,000 vehicles\n\n*Note: these forecasts were published in late May 2021*\\*. Lucid has since announced they are expediting phases 2 and 3 of their manufacturing plant into one combined phase, adding 2.7 million additional square feet of manufacturing space by 2023 and increasing production capacity to 53,000 vehicles by the same year\\*\\*\\*\\*. It is unclear how much this will affect production numbers in the years following but they would presumably increase.\\*\n\n**Revenue forecast**: Lucid is projecting 174% average annual total revenue growth, ramping from $2.2 billion in 2022 to 22.8 billion by 2026\\*. Current expectations are for a **positive EBITDA by 2024** and to be **free cash flow positive by 2025**\\*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m7ubjif50zp71.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39d87075d7ed1e05626f32fdcb85bd59550a1c4e\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **FUTURE DIRECTION:**\n\nPeter Rawlinson has said he sees three arms the Lucid Group of businesses: vehicles, electrical storage systems (ESS) and technology licensing. Vehicles are discussed above. Lucid has been developing an **electrical storage system** for some time and already has a working 300 kWh prototype at their headquarters in California\\*. They are also working towards larger pilot project at the Lucid vehicle manufacturing facility in Arizona (AMP-1). Batteries typically retain a charging capacity of around 70% once they\u2019re removed from EVs, which means they potentially have another decade of useful life\\*. Much like Tesla's home battery packs this will allow Lucid to further leverage their own expertise in battery module design targeting home, commercial and utility scale applications. Automakers like General Motors, Ford Motor, and Audi AG have also initiated second-life pilot projects.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/buq3dei60zp71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3a2698ee2c34a0a37850630aa50d9bf43d0beb3\n\nAs a **technology supplier** Lucid already provides battery modules and software to all Formula E race cars (see above). In-house technology designed for mass production will position Lucid well for large scale supply to other OEMs. They advertise potential for a wide range of applications including aircraft, eVTOL, military, heavy machinery, agriculture and marine.\n\nLucid plans to expand into foreign markets in the near future, including Saudi Arabia as early as 2022\\* and European markets thereafter. Lucid likely has a contractual obligation to the former as part of its deal with Public Investment Fund (PIF), having invested over $2.9 billion into Lucid Motors in 2018\\*. If this continues as planned then total production volumes and revenues would significantly alter market opportunities and valuation estimates outlined above.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **VALUATION ESTIMATE:**\n\n**Let's be honest this is probably the only reason you're here.** With that in mind Lucid is obviously a pre-production pre-revenue company, making an accurate estimation of its value both challenging and highly up to interpretation. One way we can approach this is by looking at its market capitalization, currently $35.1 billion at a share price of $21.67 (8/22/2021). With this in mind we can make the following comparisons:\n\n*CompanyValuation (8/22/2021)Total debtPrice-to-sales (P/S) ratio*Tesla (TSLA)$673.5 billion$11.1 billion (6/2021)\\*18.33\\*Toyota (TM)$226.8 billion$24.5 trillion (6/2021)\\*0.81\\*Volkswagen (VWAGY)$144.6 billion$219.2 billion (6/2021)\\*0.51\\*General Motors (GM)$70.8 billion$111.1 billion (6/2021)\\*0.51\\*Nio (NIO)$57.9 billion$2.7 billion (6/2021)\\*12.7\\*Honda (HMC)$50.7 billion$7.7 trillion (6/2021)\\*0.37\\*Ford (F)$50.2 billion$148.2 billion (6/2021)\\*0.37\\*Lucid (LCID)$35.1 billion$179 million\\*N/A *(see below)*Xpeng$30.8 billion$2.7 billion (3/2021)\\*N/ALi$27.1 billion$3.9 billion (3/2021)\\*N/AFisker (FSR)$3.9 billion$20.2 million (6/2021)\\*N/A\n\nThis is based on an LCID share count of 1.619 billion. However, assuming the company exercises all available warrants (*they are all ITM*) there will soon be 1.704 billion shares outstanding, raising the LCID market capitalization to $36.93 billion. With this in mind we can try to estimate LCID's current value based on their own revenue projections of $22.8 billion by 2026\\*. *If they meet this goal they are currently trading at 1.620 times future sales* ($36.93b/$22.8b). Since the market returns about 10% average per year we will assume a discount rate of 10% to bring future sales back down to present value. Given the term of 4.25 years (Sept 2021- Jan 2026) we can calculate LCID's net present value (NPV) as $15.2 billion\\*. *As a result this means* ***LCID currently trades at a P/S ratio of 2.4x*** ($36.93b/$15.2b).\n\nFor comparison you can see TSLA trades at 18.3x sales and Nio at 12.7x sales. LCID at 2.4x may very well be undervalued in this scenario. However both TSLA and Nio are currently selling cars for the 0 Lucid currently has on the road. Lucid does however have over 11,000 paid pre-orders of the Air, including the completely reserved $169k Dream Edition.\n\nWith this in mind we might be able to target a P/S ratio of let's say 5. The technology sector currently averages a P/S ratio of 7.52\\* so 5 seems more than fair. If that's the case then LCID has an upside potential of almost 106% (5/2.43). ***This would bring the share price to $44.64 with an estimated market capitalization of $76.1 billion.*** This is over a hypothetical 12 months but the rate is otherwise TBD. That may seem like a lot, but for a US manufacturer with the most efficient EV on the market I personally don't believe it is. This would put Lucid at a market capitalization close to the $70 billion being sought by Rivian for their IPO\\*.",

Currently, we are heavily reliant on TSM and other international foundry businesses to fuel this necessity.

production\n* Optimization of tools and procedures for UPW production process\n* Reuse of spent rinse waters/wastewater streams\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nLooking at the 6-month chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM\u2019s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn\u2019t pay out dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden\u2019s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

        "selftext": "Wait, Wait, before you downvote me into the depths of hells, let me explain. First, I have been contemplating buying puts on NVDA for about a month now, and it's kept on going up and the only reason I haven't pulled the trigger yet is because I feel like I'm missing something so let me explain my case, then you explain why I'm wrong. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk, first, NVDA is a 550 billion dollar company with 20 billion in revenue and a P/E of nearly 80, and a forward P/E of 60. This is literally SENILE, in 2000, when Intel was all the shit, as a 300 billion dollar company it had a P/E of 40, and now 20 years later it's still down while it's doubles it's revenue and 4x it's profit. So, with NVDA trading at a multiple of 80, even if let's say they 3x their eps in the next 5 years which is an extremely absurd assumption as they've already had a ton of growth fueled from cover, they would have 9 dollars of EPS and looking at today's stock price, if it stayed the same they would still be trading at a multiple of 24 which is ridiculous if they somehow just 4x their revenue in a matter of 5 years. Looking at all the growth catalysts I would find it only somewhat reasonable if they 2x their profit which would give them 6 dollars of EPS and keep them at a P/E of 40. That is once again Intels multiple at the peak of 2000 when it was also half the market cap. \n\nLastly, NVDA has gone up nearly 100% from it's lows in February for two reasons, slightly better than expected earnings and a stock split, none of which would justify that movement. \n\nSo, that's what I'm thinking, I HAVE TO BE MISSING SOMETHING RIGHT?, why does this seem so overvalued as such a large company, can someone please explain because if not those 2024 140 strike price puts are looking real sexy.",

        "selftext": "I gotta tell you, this sector is pretty freaking exciting.   As a private pilot, the thought of eventually flying one of these planes is incredibly cool.   As much as Tesla has done to push EVs forward, what's happening in aviation is more meaningful.    The general aviation industry is comprised of planes that are often 50 years old.  Sure, many have been updated avionics from Garmin, but most planes lack any real development.  Yeah, Cirrus has done amazing work but for the most part, the technology hasn't changed.  Part of it has been lack of investment but that's changing now.  I think new companies like Lilium and Joby have seen what's being done in the auto industry and are saying \"we can do that.\"   Established companies like Airbus are probably saying \"we'd better get our shit together.\"   \n\nThere is no doubt that companies will fail.   I have no clue where the industry will be in 10yrs.   But, if you're psyched about what's happening in the EV space, it probably makes sense to take a look here.   Below is an article that does a great job summarizing this industry.   It's not written by a pump and dump shit publication but rather the association that helps promote and govern aviation.\n\nGood luck.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/2021/september/pilot/evtols-score-big-bucks](https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/2021/september/pilot/evtols-score-big-bucks)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: From the article.\n\n\"Joby Aviation has attracted a large share of venture capital over the past year. Uber Elevate, the ride-sharing giant\u2019s air taxi concept, decided to walk away from that idea and throw support amounting to $75 million to Joby\u2019s S4, a 170-knot, 150-nautical-mile, five-seat eVTOL. Toyota, Intel, and JetBlue anted up another $820 million. Joby\u2019s Santa Cruz, California, factory has reportedly been expanded, and the company said it expects to hire 1,600 employees. Joby has raised some $1.5 billion. Reports indicate that the FAA has approved a certification pathway for the S4. Joby also says that pilot certification, airframe, and airspace regulations are in the works with the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Certification and entry into service are expected in 2023.\"\n\n\"Two German designs have also apparently been making great headway. Lilium, maker of what it calls five- and seven-seat eVTOL \u201cjets,\u201d says that certification for both designs is in progress with the FAA and EASA. These are powered by 36 electrically driven, tiltable ducted fans set in the canard and wing trailing edges. Cruise speed is advertised as 150 knots, maximum altitude as 10,000 feet, and maximum range as 135 nm. Certification is expected in 2024, with entry into service in 2025. So far, Lilium has raised a reported $390 million. The company said it plans a network of \u201cvertiports\u201d that will let passengers fly between key cities in Florida. The first vertiport will be somewhere in South Florida.\"",

        "selftext": "Barrons\n\n President Biden\u2019s budget calls for higher taxes on companies, and it\u2019s simply a matter of time before it becomes law, thanks to the Democrats\u2019 slim voting majority in the Senate. Even West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democratic moderate, appears to be on board, as long as the stimulus that the higher levies would help fund is paid for. \n\nDon\u2019t expect stocks to shrug off a tax increase. Bank of America strategist Ohsung Kwon estimates that a 25% corporate rate would cut 2022 earnings estimates by 5%, potentially erasing all of next year\u2019s expected profit growth. The tech and health-care sectors, with a 7% decline, would take the biggest hit, while energy, real estate, and utilities, for the most part,would be unscathed. \n\nFor instance, the basket of stocks with little tax sensitivity includes Canadian National Railway (CNI), with no exposure to U.S. tax rates, while the more tax-sensitive basket includes CSX (CSX), a U.S.-based railroad company. In tech, the Netherlands-based NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) is paired with the more U.S. tax-sensitive Intel (INTC). Senyek sees McDonald\u2019s (MCD) as less tax sensitive than Domino\u2019s (DPZ), and Twitter (TWTR) as less so than Netflix (NFLX).\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-market-biden-corporate-tax-plan-51630663201?mod=RTA",

ways to reduce water consumption in semiconductor manufacturing:\n\n* Transition from wet to dry etching\n* Improvements on the efficiency of etching processes used for ultrapure water (UPW) production\n* Optimization of tools and procedures for UPW production process\n* Reuse of spent rinse waters/wastewater streams\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9brk0w620oo71.png?width=2668&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e9e48b60a203a512e916039a142c8f77362a176\n\nLooking at the 6-month chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM\u2019s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn\u2019t pay out dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden\u2019s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

ways to reduce water consumption in semiconductor manufacturing:\n\n* Transition from wet to dry etching\n* Improvements on the efficiency of etching processes used for ultrapure water (UPW) production\n* Optimization of tools and procedures for UPW production process\n* Reuse of spent rinse waters/wastewater streams\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lymm2dhxxno71.png?width=2668&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92228b5de309258f52e667bf370e4ed1b6d8322e\n\nLooking at the 6-month chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM\u2019s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn\u2019t pay out dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden\u2019s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

        "selftext": "Hey guys, who of you do never watch porn or never go on YouTube? Well, I guess, none of you. However, 3.7 billion people do not have any access to the Internet; poor dudes no porn, and no YouTube. Well, guess what, one company will make money anyway when these guys get access to the internet, and **I am not talking about PornHub, it is Nvidia!**\n\nNvidia is developing very quickly its chips for data centers and eats Intel's market share every day. Here is why, if you are not a retarded living in a cave, you should buy Nvidia (NVDA). \n\n# Crazy quarterly results: \n\nLast quarter's results were monstrous, **bears go back in your cave!**\n\n* Revenues: $6.51 billion versus $6.33 billion expected (dumb-ass analysts were not even close). \n* Revenue growth:  68% annually after a growth of 84% last quarter (get the rocket ready). \n* Adjusted earnings: $1.04, versus $1.01 expected (analysts cannot grasp how much money it makes).\n\n**Dude, have you ever seen a company with such growth?** In comparison, Facebook with its 39% % growth year-over-year looks like a boomer company.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Here is why Nvidia is a cash cow for the coming years:**\n\n# Why you will make money in 1 year:\n\n\u00b7 Graphic cards (current biggest segment): **growth of 87%** to $3.91 billion. This is crazy growth, and the current valuation seems not to fully consider such growth, especially considering that it is the biggest segment of Nvidia. Nvidia has a PE of 79, it may look big, but Amazon (AMZN) has a PE of 59 and growth is tiny in comparison. Square (SQ) has a PE of more than 200.\n\n# Why you will make money in 3 years: \n\n\u00b7 Compute and network segment (chips for data centers): growth of 46% to $2.6 billion. This is crazy growth for a normal company, but it is not sufficient for Nvidia. However, the future looks sexy.\n\n\u00b7 Data are the future and companies are building data centers all the time. If Amazon invests so heavily in AWS, it is because the cloud is the future! Well, the more Amazon spends on the cloud, the more money Nvidia makes. **Demand for Nvidia chips is exploding**, especially when considering that they are way better than the one from Intel (boomers go home). The cake and the slice of the cake are growing for Nvidia and I will eat the cake as I am a shareholder!\n\n# Why you will make money in 5 years:\n\n\u00b7 Professional use: Industry will progressively get more automated and therefore needs more chips. Annually graphics cards for high-end professional workstations **went up 156% annually** to $519 million. This growth is tremendous and proves that demand is enormous. \n\n\u00b7 Secondly, its automotive business unit. Sales were up 37% from last year's respective quarter. This is poor growth (LOL) for Nvidia but the future looks awesome. If you think two seconds, you will realize that the future is not about EVs, the true revolution will be autonomous cars! And who will be the true winner? Tesla? No! Nio? No! Nvidia? Yeah boy, you got it! Considering the potential of this sector and how crazy people get \u201cjust\u201d with EVs, **Nvidia will not go to the moon but through the whole universe**, once people understand the potential of this division! \n\n# TLDR:\n\nBears have been repeating that Nvidia has been too expensive for a while. They have been repeating that it is not rational for the stock to double in 12 months and blablabla. Well, if they were not retarded, they would see that they are still **tons of catalysts** and the more time passes, the more we will use Nvidia products. So bears are gay and bulls are strong! \n\nPosition: because I do not live in a cave, I bought 50 shares, worth approximately 11,350 USD.",

AEye\u2019s iDAR\u2122 (Intelligent Detection and Ranging) system leverages biomimicry and principles from automated targeting applications used by the military to scan the environment, intelligently focusing on what matters most, enabling faster, more accurate, and more reliable perception. iDAR is the **ONLY software configurable LiDAR** (YOU READ THAT RIGHT) with integrated deterministic artificial intelligence, delivering industry-leading performance in range, resolution, and speed.

Luminar has a market cap of 5.86 billion as of today. That is almost 4x what LIDR is at right now.\n\n**Ape's instinct kicked in:**\n\nOkay I know this is retarded. You know what Luminar does? THEY MANUFACTURE LIDAR. What does this have to do with LIDR? LIDR manufactures LIDAR too. LIDR will definitely get recognition from its unique ticker symbol LIDR as it is so close to \u201cLIDAR\u201d (like i said , I am retarded.)

While many other LIDARs process in a linear or serial manner, **AEye parallel processes using a bistatic architecture**. This approach allows AEye to transmit and receive light out of separate paths, enabling the delivery of its iDAR\u2122 perception system and adaptive capabilities that power its [industry-leading range](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aeye.ai%2Fpress%2Fvsi-issues-independent-report-verifying-aeye-lidar-performance%2F&amp;esheet=52494954&amp;newsitemid=20210921005466&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=industry-leading+range&amp;index=3&amp;md5=f27492b3807e03e72c27093bbea60d99), resolution, refresh rates, agility and intelligence.\u201d\n\nAEye\u2019s patent portfolio can generally be organized into four groups:\n\n**1. Intelligent Modular Architecture**\n\nThis group of patents relate to AEye\u2019s intelligent modular bistatic architecture, system design, and its solid-state performing MEMs-based agile LiDAR. While many other LIDARs process in a linear or serial manner, AEye parallel processes using a bistatic architecture. This approach allows AEye to transmit and receive light out of separate paths, enabling the delivery of its iDAR\u2122 perception system and adaptive capabilities that power its industry-leading range, resolution, refresh rates, agility and intelligence. Equally important, AEye\u2019s design allows for flexibility in hardware packaging and vehicle placement options, unlike some LiDAR sensors that are limited to roof placement. These patents include protection of the overall architecture, of feedback techniques to keep the scanning where desired during vehicle vibration and temperature variation, as well as the ability to control detection pulse width and receiver bandwidth.\n\n**2. Open System and Extended Data Capabilities**\n\nA second group of patents focus on AEye\u2019s software definable AI technology and iDAR\u2019s ability to integrate other existing sensors, such as radar, cameras, and IMUs. These patents address AEye\u2019s unique co-boresighted design, wherein an HD camera and LiDAR receiver share the same optical axis, creating true color point clouds which enhance classification capabilities and eliminate the need for post-processing parallax correction. By co-boresighting the camera with the LiDAR receiver, AEye moves intelligence into the sensor. This enables the sensor to detect and immediately request additional data about objects and anomalies, then issue \"fast path\" priority message alerts to inform the motion planning system. By pushing detected threats to the top of the data stack under consideration by the motion planning system, AEye reduces central processing burdens, and speeds time to reaction.\n\n**3. Enhanced Data Quality**\n\nThe third group encompasses innovative features such as scan agility, which enables the sensor to \"acquire\" pre-classification attributes useful in accelerating perception systems. For example, AEye is able to pinpoint intra frame velocity by capturing both radial and lateral velocity, where most threats occur while driving. These patents build a software-defined layer upon the bistatic platform, and include the ability to optimize shot lists as a function of scenes and environment, novel tracking schemes, and tracking the horizon during car motion. The latter is an important aspect of agility and intelligence, as it reduces the required vertical scan field of view, and therefore reduces frame to frame time. iDAR\u2019s ability to enable software-defined frames and dynamic scan patterns and the platform\u2019s ability to deploy adaptive energy control on a pulse-by-pulse basis enables both the dynamic adjustment of scan patterns and the ability to adapt the laser energy for each pulse for complete interference mitigation.\n\n**4. Optical Data Networking**\n\nThe fourth group enables AEye to expand the capabilities of the AEye sensor to enable the laser to communicate information. This groundbreaking feature is uniquely enabled by AEye\u2019s adaptive LiDAR, in which the laser can be directed with precision. Pulsed message packets enable data to be transferred via line-of-sight. By using optical communications via the LiDAR system, AEye sensors can leverage a readily available, secure and reliable communications channel, which does not compete with the congested bandwidth of WiFi, cellular, and/or satellite communications, to transmit, receive, and/or transceive data.\n\n\"We set out to build a flexible architecture that could be expanded and adapted over time, adding new innovations. Our IP strategy, we believe, places us years ahead of others building single use hardware,\" said Dr. Allan Steinhardt, chief scientist at AEye. \"We will continue to push forward aggressively with developing and protecting competitive intellectual property to advance AEye\u2019s technological leadership. We are creating a thorough and rigorously defensible patent portfolio covering the architecture and software that underlie our solution.\"",

        "selftext": "I've spent over a year thinking about this, where I initially began as Facebook being my main holding. As an engineer I saw:\n\n- visionary, young CEO\n- their influence on the internet via the React development environment\n- their influence on networking via WhatsApp and low latency considerations (the number one reason I left Snapchat for Instagram many years ago in Mexico)\n- their historic imprint on social media \n- the VR hardware for future proofing\n\n\nAs an investor I saw:\n\n- an application with perverse incentives \n\n\nUltimately, after comparing FB to big tech, I feel that FB has the weakest moat compared to, say the logistics power of Amazon, the intelligence for Google, or IoT for Apple. FB has connection. \n\n- Slack in workspaces\n- Roblox in metaverse\n- Pinterest in social commerce\n- Discord in chat\n- TikTok in shorts\n- YouTube/Twitch in longforms\n- Reddit with communities\n- Twitter in messaging\n- Snapchat in snapshot media\n- Tinder in dating\n\nThe list goes on and on. The difference here is that these platforms are all EXCEPTIONALLY good at incentivizing their niche. Pinterest isn't just social e-commerce, it's also a search engine for ideas. Roblox isn't just a kids game, it's an education platform. Etc etc.\n\n\nPeople make the mistake that Facebook will eventually go the way of Myspace. This is wrong. It will remain as a dinosaur and fundamental to software, similar to that of Oracle or Intel. We already begin to see this at the application level where acquisitions of things like GIPHY inserts Facebook into the interfaces of applications like TikTok or Slack.\n\nMy view is that FB will see the beginning of the end with it's assertion into the metaverse.

        "selftext": "Barrons\n\nPresident Biden\u2019s budget calls for higher taxes on companies, and it\u2019s simply a matter of time before it becomes law, thanks to the Democrats\u2019 slim voting majority in the Senate. Even West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democratic moderate, appears to be on board, as long as the stimulus that the higher levies would help fund is paid for.\n\nDon\u2019t expect stocks to shrug off a tax increase. Bank of America strategist Ohsung Kwon estimates that a 25% corporate rate would cut 2022 earnings estimates by 5%, potentially erasing all of next year\u2019s expected profit growth. The tech and health-care sectors, with a 7% decline, would take the biggest hit, while energy, real estate, and utilities, for the most part,would be unscathed.\n\nFor instance, the basket of stocks with little tax sensitivity includes Canadian National Railway (CNI), with no exposure to U.S. tax rates, while the more tax-sensitive basket includes CSX (CSX), a U.S.-based railroad company. In tech, the Netherlands-based NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) is paired with the more U.S. tax-sensitive Intel (INTC). Senyek sees McDonald\u2019s (MCD) as less tax sensitive than Domino\u2019s (DPZ), and Twitter (TWTR) as less so than Netflix (NFLX).\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-market-biden-corporate-tax-plan-51630663201?mod=RTA",

So what's going on? Well... Lucid is having a PR event at their AZ factory this week. Word in the swamps? They are getting ready to announcing the first set of deliveries for the Lucid Air and confirming delivery dates! It's been speculated for awhile that the first deliveries was going to be sometime between Q3-Q4. There has been uncertainty with the chip shortage... but with this news, short$ will shit themselves.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.lucidmotors.com/media-room/lucid-announces-production-preview-week-at-amp-1](https://www.lucidmotors.com/media-room/lucid-announces-production-preview-week-at-amp-1)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR;**\n\n# LCID hitting production runs hard, will announce first deliveries schedule this week. Official EPA rating of 520 range. Plus with PIPE lockup expired 9/1, most of short term investors are done dumping shares. With that, and a week long PR event, very good chance they will set a date, and send the stock to URANUS!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCredits for this DD, and a shoutout, goes to [u/ddroukas](https://www.reddit.com/user/ddroukas/). I am going to snag his work and put it here for all you apes to adore, and believe the hype!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*&lt;begin\\_plagiarism&gt;*\n\nLucid is an EV manufacturer based out of Newark, California. They were founded in 2007 as Atieva and initially focused on producing battery modules and powertrains for other manufacturers. Since their inception they have been awarded over 325 patents, 50 of which pertain directly to their core battery system in the US alone\\*.\n\nIn 2013 Lucid enlisted the help of now-CEO Peter Rawlinson. Prior to this Peter was VP of Vehicle Engineering and chief engineer at Tesla helping to develop the Model S. Around this time Lucid was developing a 900 hp powertrain under the *Edna* test bed (basically a stripped dow utility van). In 2016 the company officially rebranded to Lucid Motors and revealed the earliest Lucid Air alpha prototype at the LA motor show.\n\nIn 2019 they broke ground on their Advanced Manufacturing Plant-1 (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona, the first purpose-built EV factory in the United States. The current factory is over 999k square feet with an additional 5.1 million square feet of building space planned on the 590-acre site\\*. Recently over $350 million in CAPEX for 2021-2023 was brought forward to combine phases 2 and 3 of the AMP factory into one combined phase\\*, with early construction already having begun\\*. Once complete the total manufacturing output will be up to 400k vehicles per year, and eventually upgradeable to &gt; 500k vehicles per year. Lucid also has a powertrain factory (Lucid Manufacturing Plant-1, LMP-1) located 6 miles from AMP-1 where they manufacture all their battery modules, packs, inverters, drive units and wunderboxes\\*.\n\nLucid aims to outcompete Tesla and other EV manufacturers on the basis of their technology, stating competition between Lucid and Tesla will be a \"two horse race.\"\\* In brief, the Lucid Air claims 1080 horsepower and 517 miles of range on the most energy dense powertrain to date. They offer a drag coefficient of 0.21\\*, bested only by the Mercedes EQS. They are looking to compete in the luxury EV sector with an eye for what they term as \"post-luxury,\" emphasizing sustainability and user experience over opulence\\*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vjvtldyn53q71.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8dc3f908a5b18e043ea1a2041f5af479d07ec99a\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **TIMELINE** (picture version):\n\n* 2007 \u2013 Atieva founded (info)\n* Nov 2014 \u2013 ATVUS model first shown (pre-Derek Jenkins) (article)\n* July 2015 \u2013 Edna Atieva powertrain test car (video)\n* Nov 2015 - Atieva officially renamed Lucid Motors (article)\n* Dec 2015 - ATVUS redesign to Lucid Air begins\n* Aug 2016 - DIA award Formula E battery to Atieva (article)\n* Nov 2016 - Alpha fleet revealed at LA motor show (video)\n* Apr 2017 - NY Auto Show - first public display of the Air (video)\n* July 2017 - 235 mile/hour speed run record (video)\n* Aug 2017 - Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance (video)\n* Dec 2017 - Design moves into Ardenwood; Engineering move to temporary offices\n* Sept 2018 - Series D investment (PIF major funding) (article, press release)\n* Oct 2018 - Lucid announce agreement with Electrify America providing access to ultra-fast charging network (article)\n* Feb 2019 - Move to Gateway BLVD HQ in Newark, CA (video)\n* Apr 2019 - Peter Rawlinson  promoted to CEO (press release)\n* Dec 2019 - Breaking ground on Arizona AMP-1 factory (article)\n* Dec 2019 - Beta 2 fleet begin testing (video)\n* Feb 2020 - Lucid forges long-term cell partnership with LG Chem (article, press release)\n* Sept 2020 - Lucid Air makes fastest lap time at Laguna Seca (article)\n* Sept 2020 - 9/9 Event, official launch of Lucid Air\n* Oct 2020 - First studio opes in Beverly Hills, CA (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Awarded Formula E Gen3 Lucid front powertrain (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Bloomberg publishes C\\*\\*\\* rumor (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Michael Klein fireside chat with IPO Edge - SPAC rumors begin (video)\n* Feb 2021 - C\\*\\*\\*-Lucid Definitive Agreement.

Conceptually, every electric motor can be broken down into two primary components: the *stator* (outer housing) and the *rotor* (internal component). When an electric current is applied to coils lining the stator it generates a magnetic field, and when this current is phased the magnetic field begins to rotate. Magnets on the rotor are attracted to the rotating magnetic field causing the axle to rotate, thereby creating torque. As stated earlier these rotor magnets can be permanent (like Lucid and now Tesla) or electromagnetic. The latter is less efficient because it requires more wire \u2192 more resistance \u2192 more heat \u2192 decreased efficiency. By getting rid of that wire the permanent magnet motor takes up significantly less space and allows you to combine the inverter, transmission, differential and motor into a single smaller package. In Lucid's case this brings the weight of the entire assembly down to just 164 pounds. In conjunction with a proprietary cooling mechanism (axial jet cooling manifold) and a significant decrease to cogging torque this has allowed Lucid to create ***the most power-dense drive unit on the market*** at over 9 hp/kg (compared to Tesla's 3.2 hp/kg). That's ***280% more energy-dense than the nearest competitor.***\n\nLucid's highly efficient motor can deliver up to 670 hp and 2950 lb-ft of torque. The all-wheel-drive Air has two motors and delivers as much as 1,080 total hp with a 0-60-mph time of 2.5 seconds\\*. Check out the timeline above to see videos of their speed records.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Battery***: Any manufacturer can add more batteries to an EV and increase its range, but this only increases weight and does nothing to improve efficiency (\"dumb range\"). To this end Lucid has been working to maximize its battery efficiency for almost 14 years. One of the most important parts of this is their adoption of a **900+ volt architecture**, the highest in the industry. Why does this matter? Because for the same amount of power a higher voltage system allows you to use lower current (V=IR). Lower current means less heat generated and therefore less total losses. This is based on the I2R principle, where if you x2 your current you x4 your losses. For comparison, Tesla utilizes a 350 volt architecture and would have to nearly triple the current to deliver the same amount of power as Lucid. Since Lucid uses lower currents they can use smaller cables, less wires and therefore less material mass while increasing the vehicle's efficiency. Lucid uses a total of 22 battery modules to make a complete pack, with each module producing around 42 volts for a total of 924 volts, in a package weighing around 1100 pounds total. Each module produces 5.1 kWh and with 22 of them it comes out to **113 kWh total**. This gives the Air an estimated **517 miles total range** (*EPA verification pending*) with an **efficiency of 4.6 miles/kWh**. This is the most efficient battery pack on the market, with Tesla following behind at 4.0 miles/kWh and other manufacturers even further behind still. Peter Rawlinson has stated in 2-3 years 4.8 miles/kWh is achievable, and up to 6.0 miles/kWh in a smaller vehicle format (future Lucid coupe?)\\*:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/742fsz2s53q71.png?width=2191&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee54d570338efd1f787a0d4a97c5118525c0bc46\n\nHigher volt architecture also allows the battery pack to be charged more rapidly than Lucid's competitors at up to 300kW, gaining nearly **300 miles of range in just 20 minutes**. For comparison the Porsche Taycan has previously *advertised* up to 350 kW charging but their own website now only reports only up to 270kW\\*. The Tesla Model S Plaid offers up to 250 kW\\*.\n\nFor battery chemistry Lucid has a contract with LG Chem to be their exclusive battery cell supplier\\*. While the 2170-format cells are similar to those used by other EV manufacturers, Peter Rawlinson has stated that manufacturing a battery pack is 85% mechanical and only 15% chemistry. One innovative feature of Lucid's battery packs is utilization of end-cooling as opposed to side-cooling (like Tesla)\\*. Not only is this more efficient it allows them to pack individual cells more tightly and to better optimize total energy density.\n\nIt should also be noted that Lucid has supplied all the battery packs for Formula E racing since 2018 using the 18650-format cells\\*. This same technology powering Formula E will be driving you to KFC for the 4th time this week.\n\nSome have argued that 517 miles of range is irrelevant if you're only driving to and from work every day, however keep in mind increased range does not simply imply longer individual trips\u2014it also means less frequent charging. EV adoption has historically been tempered by *range anxiety*\u2014the fear of running out of charge during a long trip. This type of range significantly decreases that anxiety and offers greater mobility than almost any commercial ICE sedan.\n\n***Wunderbox***: Lucid calls this the heart of their electrical platform\\*. It allows compatibility with\u2014and the maximizing of\u2014charging systems of differing voltages, specifically boost-voltage charging. It enables a wide array of future-ready bi-directional power delivery features. These include vehicle-to-grid (V2G) compatibility for situations such as managing home power outages as well as vehicle-to-vehicle charging (V2V).\n\n***Dream Drive***: This is Lucid's Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS). It's made up of 32 total sensors including ultrasonic, radar and an industry-first high-definition LIDAR system. There is also an internal camera system for driver monitoring and can take over in difficult situations. The Dream Drive system will be updated over the air and will deliver level 2 driving at launch. Level 3 driver assistance and geo-fenced HD mapping will be updated OTA shortly thereafter. For comparison Tesla has admitted their \"Full Self-Driving\" system is still level 2 under the definition of US authorities\\*. Nevertheless, I don't believe Lucid's intent here is to be the industry leader, and Peter Rawlinson has stated that true autonomous driving (levels 4-5) is still many years away. More information is available on Lucid's website\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oafhgqbr53q71.png?width=2452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dadc97bad09abd70b1ee188a949316f617e22f1b\n\n\u25b6 **VEHICLES AND TRIMS:**\n\n**Air sedan**: Lucid will start by offering the Air Dream Edition beginning this year (2021), with three additional trims being released sequentially over the next couple years. The Dream Edition is their top-of-the-line model and starts at a price of $161,500 (*after $7,500 tax credit in the US\\**). Future models step down in price to the $69,900 Air Pure. Each are compared in the following image:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*US tax credits are on the fence with the infrastructure bill right now\\*\n\n**Gravity SUV**: \"Project Gravity\" will be Lucid's entry into the lucrative SUV market\\*. Prototypes have already been built\\* using Lucid's Electric Advanced Platform (LEAP), the same modular platform upon which the Air is manufactured. Accordingly it should offer fairly similar specifications to that of its sedan sibling. The body will be a little wider than the Air but a good bit taller, seating up to 7 passengers. Production is expected to begin in 2H 2023.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jwmzid2t53q71.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b009d4938c971575d670084d7bd931e54aacf087\n\nProject Gravity SUV\n\n**Additional vehicles:** Lucid has future plans for an additional coupe and pickup truck by 2030\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **CHARGING:**\n\nCharging will be on the basis of Lucid-branded EV supply equipment as well as outside partnerships\\*. Lucid's own equipment will supply AC charging at 10-20 kW using their standard portable EV Supply Equipment (EVSE) versus an optional wall mount through an official Lucid-Installation partner, QMerit or an electrician of the customer's choice. Lucid community partnerships will be capable of AC charging up to \\~20kW and DC charging up to \\~300kW. *Every vehicle sold will come with three years of free charging through an Electrify America*, and will be compatible with networks leveraging J1772 and CCS charging standards such as ChargePoint and EVgo\\*.\n\nTesla's supercharger network has first-mover advantage but is highly capital intensive and limited to a legacy 400V maximum architecture, charging at 250 kW with the latest V3 units. Lucid's partnership with Electrify America is a much more CAPEX-light alternative and is compatible with 900V second-generation systems, charging at a maximum of 350 kW. It also uses the open-source CSS connector as apposed to Tesla's closed-source system.\n\nModern EVs are migrating to ultra high voltage architectures, eg, Porsche at 800V, Lucid at over 900V. Tesla systems and vehicles adopted 400V largely as a consequence of earlier technology.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**\u25b6 PEOPLE:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1bfkjqzt53q71.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05b3d680faa5175e0bc8b9d67ad399fd31555f49\n\nLucid has collected an impressive roster of executive leadership, many of which with resum\u00e9s from some of Silicon Valley's most sought-after brands. An abbreviated biography is provided below, however the take-home point is the pedigree from which Lucid draws its talent. Companies such as **Apple, Intel, Waymo, Tesla, Audi, Ferrari** and **Ford** are represented and this positions Lucid well in terms of technical expertise and networking.\n\n**Peter Rawlinson** (CEO) - Born in South Wales, UK. Studied Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College London before graduating in 1979\\*. Prior to Lucid he gathered over 30 years experience between being the Principal Engineer at Lotus Cars, Head of Vehicle Engineering at Corus Automotive and VP of Vehicle Engineering at Tesla (Sept 2009 - Jan 2012)\\*. At Tesla he was the chief engineer of the Model S, responsible for its technical execution and delivery by improving both its structure and production\\*. Peter would later join Atieva in 2013 as their Chief Technology Officer before being promoted to CEO in 2019\\*. Elon Musk has publicly tried to downplay Peter's role at Lucid via Twitter\\*; however, this has been thoroughly verified and refuted\\*.\n\n**Sherry House** (CFO) - Sherry joined Lucid Motors as Chief Financial Officer in May 2021\\*. Prior to Lucid she was Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations at Waymo LLC, an autonomous driving technology company and subsidiary of Alphabet Inc (Google)\\*. She worked to guide the company's investments, acquisitions and external fundraising. She has an engineering background with BAs in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Engineering, as well as an MBA and Masters of Manufacturing and Engineering.\n\n**Derek Jenkins** (Senior VP or Design and Brand) - Derek currently oversees all design developments including exterior and interior design, user experience, color and material, accessories and design strategy\\*. Before joining Lucid he was the Director of Design at Mazda North America Operations where he oversaw all design developments both locally and globally\\*. Prior to Mazda he was the Chief Designer for Volkswagen North America for 9 years, and was a designer for Audi in both Germany and the United States for eight years.\n\n**Eric Bach** (Senior VP of Product and Chief Engineer) - Eric has guided numerous vehicles to market for both Volkswagen AG and Tesla Motors\\*. At Tesla he oversaw several engineering functions for the Model S, Model X, and Model 3 programs. Under his leadership his teams successfully enabled the Model S and Model X programs to deliver pioneering engineering and technology solutions under vastly accelerated timelines when compared to the industry at large.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBesides executive positions Lucid currently employs over 2,000 people and has a 4.2 out of 5 score on Glassdoor.com\\*. There are currently 900+ job postings on their website indicating that they are growing very rapidly\\*, expecting more than 4000 total employees by next year\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **MARKET OPPORTUNITY:**\n\n**General EV market**: EV adoption is still very early. To draw an analogy, the growth of ICE automobiles per 1,000 people between 1900 and 1909 has a very strong correlation coefficient (98%) with the current growth of EVs between 2011 through 2020\\*. This growth will almost certainly continue due to multiple factors, including supportive government policies and regulations promoting EV adoption, increasing investments from OEMs, rising environmental concerns and the decreasing cost of batteries. Keeping this in mind EVs are in a strong position to cannibalize the $5 trillion automobile market, and there's little debate over long-term industry growth. We are only at the beginning of what looks to be a parabolic growth curve, and time in the market will almost certainly beat timing the market.\n\n**Luxury vehicle market**: In 2020 the EV market comprised 5% of all new car sales. Lucid is specifically targeting the luxury EV market which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5%, from $496 billion in 2018 to $742 billion in 2026.\n\n**Total addressable market (TAM)**: For 2021-2022 Lucid anticipates the Air model to represent 2% of the total addressable EV market (*this number may change based on current commodities and chip markets*). By 2030 they estimate a run-rate production of &gt;500k vehicles, representing an estimated 4% of total market share.\n\n**Production volume**: Production is underway at Lucid\u2019s custom-built Advanced Manufacturing Plant (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona with deliveries starting in the next few months (2H 2021). Lucid will start by selling various trims of the model Air (see above), however Project Gravity (2023) and future models (2025+) will contribute to future production estimates as outlined below:\n\n* 2021 - 577 vehicles\n* 2022 \u2013 20,000 vehicles\n* 2023 \u2013 49,000 vehicles\n* 2024 \u2013 90,000 vehicles\n* 2025 \u2013 135,000 vehicles\n* 2026 \u2013 251,000 vehicles\n\n*Note: these forecasts were published in late May 2021*\\*. Lucid has since announced they are expediting phases 2 and 3 of their manufacturing plant into one combined phase, adding 2.7 million additional square feet of manufacturing space by 2023 and increasing production capacity to 53,000 vehicles by the same year\\*\\*\\*\\*. It is unclear how much this will affect production numbers in the years following but they would presumably increase.\\*\n\n**Revenue forecast**: Lucid is projecting 174% average annual total revenue growth, ramping from $2.2 billion in 2022 to 22.8 billion by 2026\\*. Current expectations are for a **positive EBITDA by 2024** and to be **free cash flow positive by 2025**\\*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6mvvbpcv53q71.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7e542a44f9994017ad9185655a64c2596e80f58\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **FUTURE DIRECTION:**\n\nPeter Rawlinson has said he sees three arms the Lucid Group of businesses: vehicles, electrical storage systems (ESS) and technology licensing. Vehicles are discussed above. Lucid has been developing an **electrical storage system** for some time and already has a working 300 kWh prototype at their headquarters in California\\*. They are also working towards larger pilot project at the Lucid vehicle manufacturing facility in Arizona (AMP-1). Batteries typically retain a charging capacity of around 70% once they\u2019re removed from EVs, which means they potentially have another decade of useful life\\*. Much like Tesla's home battery packs this will allow Lucid to further leverage their own expertise in battery module design targeting home, commercial and utility scale applications. Automakers like General Motors, Ford Motor, and Audi AG have also initiated second-life pilot projects.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ic5i9cuw53q71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e18a5a865422e50420de66ffd9720dbf8e96f3a\n\nAs a **technology supplier** Lucid already provides battery modules and software to all Formula E race cars (see above). In-house technology designed for mass production will position Lucid well for large scale supply to other OEMs. They advertise potential for a wide range of applications including aircraft, eVTOL, military, heavy machinery, agriculture and marine.\n\nLucid plans to expand into foreign markets in the near future, including Saudi Arabia as early as 2022\\* and European markets thereafter. Lucid likely has a contractual obligation to the former as part of its deal with Public Investment Fund (PIF), having invested over $2.9 billion into Lucid Motors in 2018\\*. If this continues as planned then total production volumes and revenues would significantly alter market opportunities and valuation estimates outlined above.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **VALUATION ESTIMATE:**\n\n**Let's be honest this is probably the only reason you're here.** With that in mind Lucid is obviously a pre-production pre-revenue company, making an accurate estimation of its value both challenging and highly up to interpretation. One way we can approach this is by looking at its market capitalization, currently $35.1 billion at a share price of $21.67 (8/22/2021). With this in mind we can make the following comparisons:\n\n*CompanyValuation (8/22/2021)Total debtPrice-to-sales (P/S) ratio*Tesla (TSLA)$673.5 billion$11.1 billion (6/2021)\\*18.33\\*Toyota (TM)$226.8 billion$24.5 trillion (6/2021)\\*0.81\\*Volkswagen (VWAGY)$144.6 billion$219.2 billion (6/2021)\\*0.51\\*General Motors (GM)$70.8 billion$111.1 billion (6/2021)\\*0.51\\*Nio (NIO)$57.9 billion$2.7 billion (6/2021)\\*12.7\\*Honda (HMC)$50.7 billion$7.7 trillion (6/2021)\\*0.37\\*Ford (F)$50.2 billion$148.2 billion (6/2021)\\*0.37\\*Lucid (LCID)$35.1 billion$179 million\\*N/A \\*(see below)\\*Xpeng$30.8 billion$2.7 billion (3/2021)\\*N/ALi$27.1 billion$3.9 billion (3/2021)\\*N/AFisker (FSR)$3.9 billion$20.2 million (6/2021)\\*N/A\n\nThis is based on an LCID share count of 1.619 billion. However, assuming the company exercises all available warrants (*they are all ITM*) there will soon be 1.704 billion shares outstanding, raising the LCID market capitalization to $36.93 billion. With this in mind we can try to estimate LCID's current value based on their own revenue projections of $22.8 billion by 2026\\*. *If they meet this goal they are currently trading at 1.620 times future sales* ($36.93b/$22.8b). Since the market returns about 10% average per year we will assume a discount rate of 10% to bring future sales back down to present value. Given the term of 4.25 years (Sept 2021- Jan 2026) we can calculate LCID's net present value (NPV) as $15.2 billion\\*. *As a result this means* ***LCID currently trades at a P/S ratio of 2.4x*** ($36.93b/$15.2b).\n\nFor comparison you can see TSLA trades at 18.3x sales and Nio at 12.7x sales. LCID at 2.4x may very well be undervalued in this scenario. However both TSLA and Nio are currently selling cars for the 0 Lucid currently has on the road. Lucid does however have over 11,000 paid pre-orders of the Air, including the completely reserved $169k Dream Edition.\n\nWith this in mind we might be able to target a P/S ratio of let's say 5. The technology sector currently averages a P/S ratio of 7.52\\* so 5 seems more than fair. If that's the case then LCID has an upside potential of almost 106% (5/2.43). ***This would bring the share price to $44.64 with an estimated market capitalization of $76.1 billion.*** This is over a hypothetical 12 months but the rate is otherwise TBD. That may seem like a lot, but for a US manufacturer with the most efficient EV on the market I personally don't believe it is. This would put Lucid at a market capitalization close to the $70 billion being sought by Rivian for their IPO\\*.",

But is this really true? Can markets go anywhere but up?\n\nSo far since the beginning of 2020\n\nOil is up 103%\n\nGas 94 %\n\ncopper which is key in all our electronics is up 126%\n\niron the most used metal is up 150%\n\ncoffee is up 101%\n\ncorn is up 78%\n\nwheat 49%\n\nand sugar 87%\n\nThe housing market is up, the collectible market is up and the stock market does not look any different.\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 has recovered above pre covid levels and gained 100 % from the bottom all the while setting 43 all time highs year to date literally a new all time high every 3.5 days in 2021 and on track to beat the record of 77 yearly all time highs in 1995.\n\nRunning hot? Maybe a little... Or maybe the economy is just growing at a really fast pace? Looking at the ratio of market value to GDP however the markets are extended over a large margin to where they should be in relation to GDP.\n\nSo whats going on here? Are we really in an everything bubble that is going to pop and if so how can you invest so that you make money? Before we can answer these questions we need to understand what a bubble is.\n\nWhats a bubble\n\nA bubble is defined as an economic cycle characterised by a rapid increase in market value particularly of asset prices. It is commonly accepted that bubbles arise due to the psychology of investors. They can appear across single assets, asset classes or entire markets.\n\nBubble Cycles\n\nBubbles always follow more or less the same pattern as we will see when we look at some bubbles that have occurred throughout history. At first things start slow as the smart money and early adopters get in on the trade.\n\nMore and more professional investors start to pile in as the price starts to increase leading to awareness of the opportunity to rise until it breaks into the public.\n\nAs more and more people learn about the trade and jump in because of greed and fear of missing out price starts to really take off and run away from fundamental valuations. It is this stage where mass psychology gets more and more amplified feeding into itself leading to enthusiasm turning into greed and delusion as prices reach higher and higher.\n\nThe stock market is a zero-sum game the profits of one market participants are anothers losses. The more retail is buying the more profits the smart money are taking.\n\nThis then is one of the most telling signs of a bubble: retail investors coming in and pushing prices ever higher left to hold the bag when the smart money ultimately leads the market lower in taking all their profits.\n\nFamed investor Jim Chanos is warning about exactly this and just said in an interview with CNBC \u201cThe problem with getting more people, retail, involved is that it always seems to happen toward the end of every cycle. Retail wasn\u2019t there at \u201909 at the bottom. They weren\u2019t there in \u201902 after the dot-com bubble collapsed. They were certainly there at \u201999,\u201d- (Buying at the top that is) He goes on to say:\n\n\u201c(So) the problem in the last few cycles as I see it is that we get promotors and insiders and people who have done very well cashing out as retail is buying.\u201d\n\nPast bubbles and crashes\n\nLets take a look at some of these past bubbles to see how they stack up to where we are today.\n\nWhat is widely considered to be the mother of all bubbles became known in history as tulip mania. It is one of the prime examples showcasing how irrational behaviour leads to asset prices rising to unsustainable levels before they finally collapse.\n\nIn 1630 tulips which had only been introduced to Europe in the 1600's were starting to be perceived as special and rare. This prompted speculation in the tulip market shortly after leading prices to increase by 2000 % between November 1636 and February 1637 before plummeting by 99 % in May 1637. During this period of time some tulips were costing as much as a house clearly showcasing the disconnect from fundamental values and the greed and mania involved which are key characteristics of bubbles. One can't help but see the parallels in looking at prices that some digital or physical collectibles are commanding these days.\n\nCrxxptopunk and Axie Infinity are just two examples of NFT's that can cost much more than even the most lavish of mansions. The most expensive crxxpto punk so far has been sold for 8 million dollars. The most expensive NFT so far Beeple\u2019s, Everydays \u201d The First 5000 Days\u201d sold for a staggering 69 million dollars. But also many physical collectibles are commanding hefty premiums with the most expensive Pokemon card having been sold for 369.000 dollars. Almost a bargain in comparison to some NFT'S.\n\nWell to be fair though at least when the price of NFT's approaches its fair value somewhere closer to zero you will always still be the proud owner of your virtual good whereas the tulip will not only have lost its value but have withered away completely.\n\nJapan\n\nIn our modern time many speculative bubbles have been attributed to overly lax and stimulative financial policies of central banks. Japan's economic bubble of the 1980's is a prime example for this. After Japan entered a recession in 1986 the government countered with huge monetary and fiscal stimulus. The resulting free and abundend liquidity led to rampant speculation in the japanese stock and real estate market with prices increasing by 300 % between 1985 and 1989 and retail going all in. The bubble burst when the fiscal stimulus was withdrawn in 1991 ushering in what is now known as the lost decade due to slow economic growth and deflation. Today 30 years later the Japanese market is still trading below its 1991 highs.\n\nDot com bubble\n\nIn the 90s the internet was a rising star and with it many companies trying to commercialise its tremendous potential. Venture capitalists caught on early and in easy monetary conditions were throwing money at dot com startups. The public started catching on in 1995 and retail trading became more and more popular. Everybody was sure that there was nowhere but up for internet stocks no matter what they did or whether they even had revenues. In 1997 record amounts of capital flowed into the NASDAQ. New online brokers were making it more accessible for the average Joe to buy and sell shares and everybody was buying into the trade of a life time. At the height of the bubble their advertisements were showing that trading is an easy way to riches. Between 1995 and 2000 the NASDAQ rose by 500% from below 1000 to over 5000 points. When nobody was left to buy the bubble finally burst and the NASDAQ lost nearly 80%. At this point even blue-chip tech stocks like Intel were down by 80%. What followed was an extended bear market and a slow recovery. It should take until 2015 for markets to recover to previous levels.\n\nThe dot com bubble actually spawned another bubble on its own as investors fleeing stocks piled into the real estate market. This became known as the US housing bubble which in the mid 2000s collapsed leading to a worldwide economic crisis today known as the great recession.\n\nTo support the world economy during this time the central banks of the world started implementing quantitive easing basically increasing the money supply by lowering interest rates and purchasing assets in order to help the economy recover. At this point unprecedented amounts of money were newly created and injected into the economy. Shockingly this actually continued until 2018 when the US Fed started to taper its asset purchases which caused a liquidity crisis in the markets that after 10 years of a non stop FED powered rally were not prepared to come back to reality.\n\nAs we have seen these bubbles develop and burst over and over again following the same pattern. The reason for this is that financial markets like the whole bubble dynamic are entirely driven by human psychology which is best illustrated in the different phases of bubble or market cycles.\n\nWhere are we in the cycle\n\nFast forward to today.\n\nWe have been in a central bank induced bull market since we came out of the last recession in 2008. In 2020 COVID hit and as result the markets collapsed and millions of people lost their jobs as the world battled lockdowns that led to stores and factories closing.\n\nThe worlds central banks jumped in swiftly - injecting more liquidity into the system than ever before. They cut interest rates to zero and started large asset purchase programs in addition to the government relief programs handing out money to everybody.\n\nJust between March and June 2020 the money supply in the US increased by 300 % the largest spike ever. 40 % of all dollars in existence were printed within the last 12 months.\n\nThis flood of new free money quickly found its way into the stock markets since due to low interest rates lower risk assets are not yielding returns. Leaving investors no alternatives but to rotate to riskier higher yielding assets which today is known as TINA: there is no alternative.\n\nAs we have seen earlier this flood of money combined with supply chain shortages caused by Covid lead to rampant price inflation throughout different asset classes within a short amount of time. It sure looks like we are in bubble territory but where are we within the cycle?\n\nOne key characteristic of any bubble nearing its peak is the involvement of the general public or retail crowd. Therefor the degree to which retail investors play a part in the current boom cycle plays a key role in understanding where we are in the bubble. So what does the data tell us\n\nRetail participation in bubbles\n\nSince the beginning of the pandemic the amount of retail brokerage accounts opened has skyrocketed. Robin Hood now has 18 million users almost doubling their amount of users before the pandemic started. They introduced fractional shares allowing you to start investing with as little as 1 dollar. Their advertising message is everybody is an investor and I guess in a bubble everybody is. The interest for trading has spiked online and offline. You know its getting sketchy when your little niece asks you for stock tips.\n\n(Infamous wallstreetbets subreddit now has 11 million members up from only 800 k two years earlier. Wallstreetbets users were already gabmling /yoloing away their life savings and at some point even started finding ways to exploit the robin hood app in order to borrow more money to risk even more. When robinhood posted on wallstreetbets and asked users to stop doing this robinhood ended up being banned from the subreddit. Sure looks like a little mania going on.)\n\nBut there is not only more retail trading the new traders are also younger and more inexperienced. A large part of todays market participants has never even seen a market correction of more than 10 % let alone a true recession. It is no surprise than that these investors are overly optimistic and can not believe the market can go anywhere but up.\n\n(It sure seems though that history is set to repeat and most of the retail crowd will be left holding the bag instead of taking home the tendies. As an old saying on wallstreet goes:\n\n&gt;\u201cA man with money meets a man with experience. The man with the experience leaves with the money, while the man with money leaves with experience.\u201d)\n\nThe only thing more telling than the growing number of retail traders is the amount of money that has been flowing into the market.\n\nOver the last 25 years global equities had inflows of 727 billion USD cumulatively. Now hold on tight because this is truly crazy. Global equity inflows for 2021 annualized amount to 1.015 trillion USD. Yes thats right trillion not billion almost 300 billion more than have been flowing into the market over the last 25 years combined coming in in just one year. Over 80 % of these flows have gone into passive funds, ALL US, ALL LARGE CAP. At the same time margin debt has risen to historic highs as well. Market participants have never been this leveraged before.\n\nThese days in the light of the FED support there is only one mantra driving the crowd: buy the tulip uhhh... dip.\n\nCrash scenario\n\nIt seems then that retail is indeed all in or at least getting pretty close. Looking at these unprecedented huge inflows into equities and the retail trading frenzy it sure looks like we are in the last cycle of the bubble but how and when is it going to pop?\n\nThere are currently many challenges ahead that might trigger a bigger correction or crash leading to these bubbles to burst. Lower vaccine efficacy and the spread of the delta variant are impacting supply chains putting more pressure on already elevated prices and slowing down the Chinese economy. The FED starting to taper into a slowing recovery might as well be a recipe for the crash that we have been waiting for.\n\nBut whatever event is going to trigger the sell off every day\u00a0margin debt is growing the resulting margin call avalanche that will ensue is getting bigger and bigger making sure that whatever correction we will see will not be a small one and might even trigger a recession.\n\nHow to profit from this\n\nIt sure seems like the central banks are running out of options and it will be very interesting to see how they respond to this.\n\nSo when is this going to pop? It is very difficult to time market tops or bottoms due to the psychological nature of market cycles. As we have seen when looking at historic bubbles they can stretch on for years before they reach their peak. As they say on wallstreet: the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.\n\nIn the past the yield curve has been a great leading indicator to detect a recession ahead. Of course there is no guarantee this will be predictive again but there is a good chance since ultimately it is down to smart investor behaviour. In any case watch out for the yield curve inverting as a warning signal.\n\nNobody knows what event or chain of events will cause enough market participants to panic sell and trigger a crash. However being aware of these cycles and roughly what part of the cycle we are in allows you to manage your portfolio in a way that you can make money instead of loosing it. As promised lets look at how to do exactly that.\n\nLets assume that your portfolio is already well diversified. Now your goal is to maximise your profits and minimise your risk therefor you want to have liquidity available to buy into a crash and at the same time protect your existing portfolio from losses. There are different ways to do this but my preferred way is to keep taking profits on a regular basis on all my positions. The resulting profits are partly held in cash or liquid inflation protected assets and the other part is used to build a position that is going long volatility. The current market has very low volatility. The only way is up and there are only minute corrections to the downside that are immediately bought up. This means the VIX a measurement for volatility is trading at relatively low levels. A big correction or crash in the overall market will lead the VIX to spike up. Thus going long volatility while buying the VIX with futures, options or ETF's earns our portfolio excellent protection from the crash. If you balance the VIX position and your portfolio out correctly you can easily cover all losses with the VIX position all the while being liquid enough to buy into the crash in order to profit from the recovery that inevitably will ensue.",

The CRM stock was from the result of Slack acquisition. \n\nFor Intel, I'm waiting to see how their big.Little CPUs and ARC GPUs will perform in reviews. If the reviews are good, I'm going big in Intel. There is usually a huge lag between a reviews of CPUs/GPUs to Wallstreet reacting. For example, AMD Zen2 was going to be a massive success if you read the reviews. Wallstreet didn't react until many months later. In addition, the government will keep Intel alive no matter what because they need a domestic chip manufacturer. Lookout for a ton of government subsidies to Intel.\n\nFor Qualcomm, I'm betting that their Nuvia acquisition will allow them to move into the laptop/desktop market but it's a small bet right now. Again, I will wait for reviews of their first Nuvia product before deciding if I want to buy more because of the lag between reviews and Wallstreet reacting.\n\nSo far, I've beaten S&amp;P500 last year and this year so far.",

Make sure to read the Government Intervention section. This is critical to understanding the semiconductor market as a whole.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe recent chip shortage has shown that the U.S can't keep up with semiconductor demand. Joe Biden has laid out a $50B subsidy plan for research and development in the semiconductor industry. In the CEO Summit on Semiconductor Supply Chain Resilience, Biden stated that this was a \u201conce in a generation\u201d investment for the future. Semiconductor chips are as essential to our everyday lives as water.\n\n\u200b\u200b**Government Intervention Timeline**\n\n*March 31, 2021* \\[Source\\]([https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/))\n\n* White House proposes a $50B subsidy plan for research and development to strengthen the U.S supply chain under the CHIPS Act.  \n\n   * The CHIPS Act *(June 11, 2020)* offers a tax income credit for semiconductor equipment and manufacturing.\n\n*April 12, 2021* \\[Source 1\\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWAa10ljxLA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWAa10ljxLA)) \\[Source 2\\](\\[Source\\]([https://www.ttnews.com/articles/biden-reassures-chip-summit-bipartisan-support-new-funds](https://www.ttnews.com/articles/biden-reassures-chip-summit-bipartisan-support-new-funds))\n\n* Biden joins the Virtual CEO Summit on \"Semiconductor Supply Chain Resilience.\"\n* Biden states that this plan is a \"once-in-a-generation investment in America's future.\"\n* CEOs who attended the meeting include General Motors CEO Mary Barra, Ford Motor CEO James D.

ways to reduce water consumption in semiconductor manufacturing:\n\n* Transition from wet to dry etching\n* Improvements on the efficiency of etching processes used for ultrapure water (UPW) production\n* Optimization of tools and procedures for UPW production process\n* Reuse of spent rinse waters/wastewater streams\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/772aqq7nwno71.png?width=2668&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7319d506eb7da567c5ab1a86d4e4f1d08dc06e29\n\nLooking at the 6-month chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM\u2019s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn\u2019t pay out dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden\u2019s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. We are not experts.
