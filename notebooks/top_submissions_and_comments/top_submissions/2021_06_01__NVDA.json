I had something like 20 shares and I sold before the earnings announcement, which the stock dropped after, but now has continued on an uptrend.  I'm debating on buying 50 shares before the split.  I believe in the company, the CEO, and the revenue is excellent.  They are up 83% from the 2020 quarter earnings.  They are the leader in GPUS (by far) and I really feel like this is a solid company, based on the technology and their earnings.  I am debating on investing 25k until the split to see how it goes.

        "selftext": "Hey all, doing a bit more brainstorming on income ideas. I noticed some fairly large spreads on deep ITM verticals. This example isn't too deep in the money, but illustrates the point. This an $NVDA JUN 4 680/690p spread. Assuming it was bought at or about mid it would be about $8. Assuming that $NVDA is at or below $680 shortly before close (or when assigned) we should be able to execute the long leg and receive $10. This would give us a $2 profit on what we paid. \n\nThat sounds all well and good, but I did some backtesting with this idea. The curious part comes one expiration day when the spread is extremely further ITM or the short leg is slightly ITM. The pricing in the former you'd actually get much more than the cost-the difference in the spreads and the latter much less. Lack of sleep and these funny cigarettes is making me miss as to why.\n\nAnyone have info? Am I missing something big here? Experiences in cash flowing this way? Thanks again!",
