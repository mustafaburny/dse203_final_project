        "selftext": "Folks, \n\nI'm a first time investor from India(I've been investing in the Indian markets for a while, now a newbie in the US markets). \n\nI'm trying to broadly understand what themes would play out in the coming months, so I can take calculated risks. I'm listing out a bunch of sectors that I think might have bullishness, (the ones I know and understand). \n\nPlease do comment and add to the list - any inputs highly appreciated. \n\nThanks, \n\nKrishna\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGiven the holiday season - \n\n1. Ecommerce - OSTK, AMZN, (JD, BABA - these are Chinese, of course), maybe even CVNA?\n2. Delivery companies - FDX, UPS, et al. \n\nCompanies affected due to covid - \n\n1. REGN, LLY, NOVAVAX, et al. (Also Biotech, pharma companies working on vaccines and therapeutics) \n2. Even companies like PEIX(medicinal alcohol manufacturers) and similar ones. \n\nTech companies - names abound here\n\n1. NVDA - demand due to video game demand going up due to people staying home more. \n2. MSFT, GOOG, AAPL, QRVO, QCOM, APPS, the list goes on...\n\nGold - as a safe haven - given the vagaries of the market and its manic moods. \n\n1. Barrick gold(GOLD) and other miners\n\nHousing - there is a boom in housing (owing to low interest rates, probably?)\n\n1. BLD, BLDR, LGIH...\n\nAlternative energy\n\n1. Solar, EVs, Hydrogen, fuel cell companies - SEDG, RUN, NIO(Evs), TSLA...\n\nRemote working themes - \n\n1. Companies like Zoom and others that facilitate remote working",

        "selftext": "Hey Gang,\n\nI bought some QRVO 11/16 145C last week and want to share my thought process.  Feedback welcome\n\n1) Earnings coming up in 3 weeks and the stock has not begun it's run-up yet.  \n\n2) QRVO has beaten expectations each of the last 4 quarters, but the stock has moved little in the last 90 days\n\n3) 30 days ago QRVO raised guidance for this quarter, but the stock is only up about 10% since then.  In my experience, companies that raise guidance will not only beat the raised guidance, but will also project upbeat expectations for the future when earning are reported.\n\n4) The November 145C are only about $6 -- this seems pretty cheap considering the typical moves this stock has made pre and post-earnings in the past.\n\n5) I don't know much about technicals, but [BarChart.com](https://BarChart.com) says these are all looking good.\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vnfcwe5d7ns51.png?width=1312&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cc216c1634f1d26cd526b643317734a6274c1ae\n\nI haven't decided whether to hold these through earnings or not - but am very comfortable we will see at least a 75% gain in the 11/16 145C in the next couple weeks.\n\nThoughts?",
