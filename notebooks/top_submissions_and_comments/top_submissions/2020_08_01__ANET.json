        "selftext": "So I\u2019ve been riding AMD\u2019s cock since late June and have made some great returns, especially in the past two weeks. That being said, today I sold my remaining call contracts on the stock. No, not because I think AMD is going to drop (although it will have price pullback all the way down to $77)- but because I think there\u2019s an opportunity that many investors (including you autists and bag holders) are overlooking.\n\nINTC took a massive hit the last two weeks (-$13.42 between 07/20-07/31) , following a pump on AMD after their Q2 earnings beat, with the additional help of many news outlets covering the AMD versus INTC battle. In the midst of all of this, INTC decides to let everyone know that they will not be manufacturing chips anymore- which sealed the deal on AMD being a dominant force in the chip manufacturing industry. \n\nI see a lot of people, especially on this retarded reddit page full of blind option traders (with the exception of the 10% who know what they are doing) talk about how \u201cINTC is going to drop all the way down to $32\u201d... \n\n\n\n- Here is what you need to understand about Intel -\n\nSince 2014, Intel\u2019s revenue in the Client Computing Group (chip manufacturing) has dropped almost 7% in 6 years. You cannot let this news regarding Intel\u2019s switch in corporate direction give jurisdiction on whether you think the corporation will be of any value a year from now. It is obvious that Intel has been slowing the production of their chips for atleast two years now, and they have slowly been shifting in a different direction because of an increase in revenue provided from the data sector.\n\n\n\nSo what does this all mean?\n\nThe fact that Intel has cut the manufacturing of chips is actually a good thing for the corporation, whether you think so or not. It has been a slowly-decaying revenue stream for years, and the money can be implemented in other sectors in which Intel has seen yearly-growth in revenue.\n\nI know, it\u2019s hard. Intel isn\u2019t making chips, doesn\u2019t make sense right? Yea it kind of doesn\u2019t make sense. BUT, in a broader scheme of things, it does. They have been getting killed by their competitors for years, so the move seems appropriate.\n\n\n\nINTC STOCK\n\nThe only times INTC stock has dropped below $50, in the past 3 years, were for the following reasons:\n\nAugust to February 2018- Intel suffers scrutiny for announcing that they are shifting their focus away from chip making and towards A.I., memory solutions, cloud computing, and IoT.\n\nJuly to August 2019- News articles released regarding AMD\u2019s new Ryzen chips and their comparison to Intel.\n\nMarch 2020- Do i really need to explain this drop\n\n\n\nConsensus\n\nINTC has been hinting for YEARS that they are leaving the chip manufacturing sector and turning towards other profitable ones. Their latests announcement shouldn\u2019t be a surprise, but if you are someone who hasn\u2019t followed them for years- then it may seem like one.\n\n\n\nThe reason you are reading this\n\nINTC 60C - exp 01/15/21 \nThese \u201crelatively small\u201d leap contracts are sold for pennies on the fucking dollar right now. If you read what I just wrote, which I\u2019m sure most of you won\u2019t- then you would understand that this move has a lot potential. Right now, INTC isn\u2019t gonna drop any more. If it goes below $40, then maybe I\u2019m wrong.\n\nBut I\u2019m never wrong.\n\n\n\nAmd to the moon, but lets not be retarded on how we value a major corporation like this. I mean cmon. LOL",

        "selftext": "Alright guys so I'm one of the hosts on a YouTube channel named \"Max Tech\".  \nI previously did YouTube work for the channel \"Appleinsider\" since 2016, making videos on Apple products which include Mac computers with Intel chips. \n\nI also grew up playing video games and building custom PCs right when AMD started to release six-core and 8-core processors that were cheaper than Intel CPUs and targeted towards gamers.  \n\nEven though the Intel chips were better for gaming, I still bought AMD because they were cheaper. Intel maintained the lead for many years since games really only used 4 cores, and Intel chips gave more consistent frame rates for gaming.\n\nAt one point, it was clear to me and to everyone else that Intel was intentionally holding off from innovating and improving their performance because they already owned a bulk of the market share. They realized that they could make more profit by making small improvements every year, while AMD was busting their ass trying to figure out how they can compete. (it was ultimately the gaming and custom PC market) \n\nMeanwhile.. Apple was using Intel chips quite successfully in their Mac computers the like MacBooks and iMacs. And Apple was also using their XEON chips for their higher-end machines. And of course, Intel was killing it in the server market.\n\nNow in 2013, Intel announced that they were working on their new 10nm chip process and that it should be ready to launch in 2015, and they said their 7nm chips should launch in 2017. \n\nBack to Intel, over the new few years, Intel delayed 10nm to 2016... and then to 2017.. and then to late 2019... We are now in 2020 and Intel is still shipping 14+++++ nm chips for high-end machines like the 2020 5K Apple iMac that was just released yesterday. Only laptops are getting the actual 10nm chips right now. \n\nIn 2017, AMD shocked the world by announcing their new Ryzen chips, and then also their Threadripper chips, and ever since then, they've been quickly catching up to Intel in terms of both performance and price. \n\nBecause of this, Intel instantly started lowering the price of their chips, and in 2018, they finally made 6-core chips for the MacBook Pro. 8-core chips in 2019, and now 10-core chips in 2020. This is an obvious and desperate move to try and compete with AMD. \n\nBecause Intel's 10nm chips were not ready in 2015 or 2016, Apple's redesigned 2016 MacBook Pro which was thinner than ever before, had overheating issues. The overheating was severe in 2018 with the 6-core chips that Intel made in fear of AMD. \n\nThere were even leaked emails from Intel executives worried about AMD's price to performance beating out Intel. \n\nAnd right now, it is well known that AMD is making BETTER price-to-performance x86 chips. \n\nThe MOST important part of this discussion is that the tech community as a whole, including or YouTube and Reddit, are now convinced that AMD is the way to go. I've seen countless comments on my videos that are dissing on Intel chips and wishing that Apple would switch to using Intel. \n\nIf we make a build guide video using an Intel processor, we get shamed and called dumb for not using an AMD chip. Our Mac Pro videos got a ton of negative feedback because Apple is stupid for using Intel chips. Our 2020 MacBook Pro videos were getting comments dissing on Intel's 10th-gen chips. The entire community is starting to hate Intel and preferring AMD.  \n\nAMD stock has increased over 11x since they announced the first Ryzen chips in August of 2016.  \nIntel stock has only increased 38% since that same date. \n\nAnd looking towards the future.. Intel has recently delayed their 7nm chips until late 2022 or 2023. This caused their stock price to tank at they last earnings call. \n\nThere's even now a class-action lawsuit against Intel because of this delay. \n\nThis also caused their chief of chip engineering to resign, and they reorganized their entire chip team. \n\nThey've even discussed outsourcing their future 6nm, 5nm and 3nm chip production to their rival foundry TSMC because they've lost confidence in their own foundry. \n\nSo it's clear that Intel is getting killed by AMD with each passing year, and the tech community knows it. (Which is VERY important)   \n\n\nThis brings us into the Apple and TSMC portion of this DD.   \n\n\nBack in 2013, Apple announced their A7 chip for their iPhone 5s, the first 64 bit smartphone chip, and ever since then, there was a massive performance war between Apple and Qualcomm, fighting to create the fastest smartphone chips, in which Apple ultimately won. \n\n(The A13 in the iPhone 11 Pro is still much faster than the Snapdragon 865+ which was just recently released this year) \n\nStuck in the middle of this battle was TSMC, which has been the EXCLUSIVE manufacturer of Apple Silicon chips for their iPhones and iPads since the A10 chip in 2016. \n\nAnd in 2018, Apple released their 11\" iPad Pro with the A12X chip manufactured by TSMC's 7nm process. This iPad from 2 years ago is so powerful that it still outperforms the new 2020 13\" MacBook Pro with Intel's 10th gen chip in both processor AND graphics performance. \n\nNow, Apple is about to announce their iPhone 12 in about a month that's gonna pack the A14 chip which is being built on TSMC's brand new 5nm process. \n\nAnd of course, the next iPad Pro will get a much improved A14X 5nm chip, and it's the same story for the Apple Silicon Mac chips that will start being released later this year in October/November. \n\nI'm of course, talking about Apple finally ditching Intel and moving forward with their own chips. This makes sense for Apple for various different reasons.\n\n1: They can run iPhone &amp; iPad apps on their Macs.\n\n2: They control both the software and hardware for incredibly amounts of performance optimization.\n\n3: They can make sure every new Mac update gets a new chip with performance improvements instead of relying on Intel to release improved chips. \n\n4: This is of course, much cheaper for Apple since they don't have to pay Intel the high price of their chips. \n\n5: They don't have to deal with overheating issues since most Intel chips are still on 14nm technology, therefore running very hot and using a lot of power.   \n\n\nAnd there's a good chance that the very first Apple Silicon Mac chips are gonna outperform the current Intel chips, stay much cooler and give you much better battery life. \n\nJust to give you some perspective in terms of how Intel's 10nm compares to TSMC's 5nm..\n\nIntel 10nm transistor density: around 100 million transistors per square millimeter.\n\nTSMC 5nm transistor density: around 171 million transistors per square millimeter. \n\n  \nTSMC has already confirmed that they're working on risk production of their new 3nm process in 2021,  with those chips going into 2022 iPhones, iPads and Macs. \n\nSo here's what the future looks like:\n\n  \nIntel 7nm in late 2022/2023 : 240 million transistors per square millimeter\n\nTSMC 3nm shipping in 2022 Apple products: 290 million transistors per square millimeter\n\nAnd apparently, TSMC is already working on plans for their 2nm process for 2024.   \n\n\nAnd due to Intel's past, there's a very good chance that Intel could delay 7nm even further, especially since they had to restructure their entire chip team, while TSMC has been on point.   \n\n\nSo the future isn't looking very bright for Intel's chip technology compared to TSMC. No wonder why they wanted to outsource their chips from them.   \n\n\nAnd one last bit on Apple's switch to their own chips built by TSMC. \n\nApple has already given developers their transition kit which is a Mac Mini with an A12Z chip from their iPad Pro. \n\nOne developer tweeted this: \"At this point, I think that the first gen Apple Silicon machines will be faster at running x86 code than an actual x86...\"  \n\n\nWhat he means is that Apple's new Rosetta 2 emulation software is so good that he thinks it'll outperform Intel chips even though it's not running natively for ARM. \n\nSo basically, Apple made the right choice by ditching Intel.   \n\n\nAnd if Apple proves everyone wrong by coming out with incredibly great Macs thanks to their switch to their own Apple Silicon ARM-based chips, then there's a VERY good chance that the rest of the market will follow them and start developing ARM-based chips for laptops.\n\nThis will force Windows to start heavily investing in their ARM-based Windows software. \n\nAnd if you didn't already know.. Intel is FAR behind in the ARM-based chip world.   \n\n\nNow, the most common argument I hear is this: Apple is only a tiny part of Intel's business, and while that may be true.. the MOST important thing is the public's view of Intel.  \n\n\nThe tech community is already starting to despise Intel as a brand name because of their overpriced processors and the fact that AMD is beginning to CRUSH them. \n\nJust wait until Apple Silicon Macs start getting released and people realize that ARM-chips have a ton of potential, and they'll start hating Intel even more. \n\nThis will cause Intel's brand recognition and reputation to get absolutely destroyed in favor of AMD and Apple Silicon. This alone will lead to less market share. And what will happen if Nvidia or Apple buy out ARM? \n\nAnd by the way, there are now more and more ARM-based servers popping up, so there's a good chance that Intel will start to lose market share on the server side if ARM-based servers prove themselves. (They use less power so this makes sense for server farms)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically, what I'm trying to say is that Intel just got ditched by Apple.. and they're getting killed by AMD and TSMC. ARM is coming VERY quickly and Intel is NOT ready. They have been plagued with delay after delay, and all of this drama will ruin the confidence of their staff, leading to lowered productivity. It's not looking good for Intel for the long-term.  \n\n\nAs of right now, Intel stock is very cheap, and you might make a few bucks if you trade short term.. but I wouldn't hold Intel stock long term.   \n\n\nIf you want more in-depth info with visuals and extra details, you can check out two videos I made on the Max Tech Youtube channel: \n\n\"How Intel Lost the CPU Race..\"\n\n\"Apple Silicon ARM Chips vs Intel x86 Processors for Mac?\"\n\nHopefully you enjoyed this DD.",

        "selftext": "Listen up fuckers.\n\n\nI\u2019m not ludicrously experienced with options, but I can recognize some bullshit when I see it. This arcticle [(Intel \u2018Stunning Failure\u2019 Heralds End of an Era for U.S. Chip Sector)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-stunning-failure-heralds-end-030711424.html) and a bunch of other \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b news caused $INTC to drop off the face of the earth last week. \n\n\nI kinda fail to see the drama. Intel has always outsourced it's chips. Maybe it's doing it more now, but even 8 years ago when my brother and I built our first PC's. His chip was from Mexico, mine was from Taiwan. \n\n\nFurthermore, TSMC, the company this article says Intel should sell factories to, has been the heavyweight chip maker for a decade or more.\n\n\nNvidia and AMD for example, they are the two graphics card manufacturers. BOTH of them have their chips made by TSMC. These companies do all their designing, but in the end everything is made by TSMC anyway. At least, a lions share of it.\n\n\nNow, Intel definitely has struggled in the recent market, but that's because they've demolished AMD in the performance chip market for nearly two decades. There was no reason to keep pushing their envelope, spending billions on R&amp;D for a better product. All they had to do was refine their Lake series processors and they'd continue to rake in a ton of profit. This profit was used to expand their market to the mobile industry. Particularly laptops. For a long time it was hard to get an apple product with any kind of processor that wasn't Intel.\n\n\nThey're not going away. They're not crashing.\n\n\nThey're just finally seeing AMD pass them in one market. This has caused other markets to start to shift due to uncertainty about who the \"best\" chip manufacturer is, but trust me - we will see Intel back with a fiery vengeance.\n\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if Intel pops out some high core count chips that are pushing 5.0-5.5 all core clock count speeds. Once they scale down their transistor size... Oof. It's going to be a Rottweiler back in the pit. \n\n\n\nTL;DR INTC $55c 09/18, but load up on whatever the hell you want, these contracts are CHEAP",

        "selftext": "Microchip is a semiconductor company out of Arizona with a Mkt. Cap of about $26 Billion. They make chips for a bunch of products like Cyber Security, Wireless Products, and Telecommunications. The thing is that they earnings on 08/04 Tuesday after hours. It is very obvious that are going to beat earnings. Why? Because look at the rest of the industry: Qualcomm, Intel, AMD, Qorvo, and IBM have all destroyed earnings. And since Intel just told everyone that they're too retarded to even make potato chips all the smaller time semiconductor competitors are making bank, example: AMD and QCOM. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMicrochip isn't just your run of the mill small back water company. They actually make acquisitions of other chip companies and use their intellectual property to increase the quality and market share of their own chips. Microchip was found in 1989 and has since made 16 acquistions!!! \n\nYou may, for some reason, say that only big boy chip companies are gonna beat earnings. Well if you don't believe me think about the industries that depend on Microchip for their needs: online educational servicing companies, cloud servicing companies, cyber security companies, telecommunications companies, and just software/tech companies in general. What the hell do we already know about these industries from earnings season? We know they absolutely massacred earnings estimates as everything during COVID has gone tech. Yes, the age of actual industry is dead. Now there are only tech companies that get pumped because of sky high demand (looking at you Apple) and Amazon that sells random shit and still has a tech company valuation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh and you know what's awesome because we have all this knowledge? MCHP is expected to post $1.43 EPS on tuesday, but last year on this quarter they posted $1.41 EPS. What a fucking joke, we should expect at least 40-50% growth in that number from COVID induced semiconductor demand. Not to mention, I think MCHP is gaining market share and could be a big player in a few years in the semiconductor industry. \n\nYou might be hesitant because of my last post on $TER, a chip supplier that many people played incorrectly. I say to you, fuck you. I made money on that play because I sold directly at market open after they destroyed earnings like my data said they would. So if you feel even the slightest FOMO look at these charts from last week: QCOM, QRVO, and AMD; and then tell me what you think MCHP (the same industry) will do!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; MCHP $107c 08/07",

Or GOOG invents an improvement to instant results, ie Mind Results, results pop up on your android even before you type anything, and it works on 50 different languages.

Intel is still insanely profitable with lots of collaborations and products lined up. Also safe from any COVID-19 related shutdowns.\n2. Consistent Grind Up history after beatdowns. Tends to slowly increase, but expecting a Pop tomorrow or Wednesday due to some factors listed below.\n3. Ex-dividend date this Thursday. Dividends are only distributed if bought before the date so run ups are higher likely tomorrow and Wednesday. Dividend also demonstrates the fundamental strength of the company.\n4. Alot of Insider buying recently with leaked Institutional buying this week(sorry can\u2019t say who but yeah going to get called out but it is what it isss).\n5. Stimulus package confirmation this week may cause excessive euphoria in market-leading to even more buying.\n\nSafe price target would be \\~50.4 and could easily run past 52+. Hope this helps!",

Really interesting business model for Semis AMD has.\n\nIn 2019, you couldn't get away from heating up of the trade war. Congress began debating SAR for HK around the end of  Hong Kong's \"2019 Summer of Love\" and rumors of what happens in the \"re-education\" camps / \"Where did the Falun Gong practitioners go?\" This is important because of the SWIFT system of world banking. HK is how they get dollars.\n\nThen in November of 2019, this happened..\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Human_Rights_and_Democracy_Act#Related_bill\n\nArizona plant news is where the tin foil ends and the conviction began for me. The Foundry is basically THE corporation of Taiwan. The Great Cheetoh has been making deals around the world, and technically Taiwan isn't China. We have recent armament deals with Taiwan and Japan to prove it.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/TLKt9yPb-f0\n\nWhy not?? Seemed like the American thing to do and there is a republican in office hell-bent on decoupling US communications tech from the CCP aka ROC.\n\nIn Feb / March... Rona. April the economic fallout, news about bad PPE and tests from China being sold to Italy. In May all the US boats in Taiwanese waters and the rhetoric worldwide basically reflecting that the world isn't happy with the CCP.\n\nI had the balance for a RH call and it made more sense than an airline play at the time, so i got in.\n\nAnti CCP rhetoric started heating up and bi-partisan on the YouTube's, by the way, it seems 2020 is the year NBC (Comcast) discovered ad-revenue. Thank you Lester.\n\nAt this point morning wood for TSM was a regular thing, so i set my limits on call options for both accounts, and incorporated into the LT DRIP. Thank you Papa Powell. I'm still poor, couldn't have done it without you...\n\nThen it seemed to be heating up at the end of May. Everyone is like WTF 'mate on the \"One Belt. One Road.\" Initiative, both the geographical and digital. People are really starting to report on not-so-great stories out of China, and not just tinfoil or Epoch Times channels.\n\nLot of shade being thrown on China tech, and things are heating up in S China Sea.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/6KiLhxgIBys\n\nhttps://youtu.be/BTgDYhtr-LU\n\n...looks like Chy-na is on everyone's shit list, including Australia. Forex folks know how dope-tied the Aussie's and Kiwis are to CCP trade relations.\n\n The rumor was potential decouple from China. I mean the world is kinda dope-tied to Santa's little elves. I just realized how weird Christmas will be...\n\nI bought my shares for both accounts as per the voodoo ritual of purchasing at least 1 stock of a long term call strategy.

A little over 3,000% between 2 contracts that cost $75 total.\n\nAlong the way, i picked up RH tendies and rebalanced the cash / bought more contracts and shares. They're officially part of the DRIP.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/UFKPnOz\n\n\nRelated post I made last week regarding TSM and INTC. Any thoughts on how US semi production will play out for them?\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i0jqtu/opinions_on_taiwan_semiconductor/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\n\nLast week, The Fool confirmed many of the LT bias I had been building up on a win for The Foundry since November. All hype, or real talk?\n\nhttps://www.fool.com/investing/2020/07/31/3-tailwinds-are-lifting-tsmcs-stock-to-new-all-tim.aspx\n\nFinancial analysis-\nThis guy is boring af, but he goes through the numbers that no one likes to read, records in mobile, and is cool enough to zoom in on what he is talking about.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/wVxF7wwuogo\n\nCan anyone see a downside other than \"COVID CLAP Trumps all\"? Maybe I've been chewing too much YouTube tinfoil on lunch, but the limit orders that are closing 930-4pm are making me think I've hit the Autistic Lottery. Wish I had bought more.\n\nFriday, all I could see was a bull flag on the 4hr and 30min charts. Monday 8/03 it hasn't shit the bed at 11am EST. Maybe thats just the tin foil talking again and this is the ceiling.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/nRYKBB5",

The AOA sensor is manufactured by a private company called Rosemount Aerospace.\n\nAnother issue was with the \"maneuvering characteristics augmentation system\" (MCAS) which is the flight control system that is heavily impacted by all the sensors on the plane (especially the AOA).\n\nLooking forward, the FAA has clearly stated requirements that will allow the 737 MAX to return to flight around the world. they are:\n\n*  Completion of all TAB return to service (RTS) recommendations and acceptance by the TAB of those completed actions. (these are the 7 things about AOA and MCAS)\n* Completion by BA and Acceptance by FAA the new regulatory requirements\n* Official revisions to documentation/training for the 737 MAX\n\nAdditionally, there are specific requirements before it can fly in the US:\n\n* For delivered/yet to be delivered 737s, all FAA changes must be incorporated and updated based on the above changes\n* All Pilots must be trained and certified on the new changes BA will be making to aircraft operation.\n\nAfter this is compelte, FAA will issue a  Continued Airworthiness Notification to the International Community (CANIC) (example [here](https://www.faa.gov/news/updates/media/CAN-2019-05.pdf)). this basically tells the international 737 MAX owners to:\n\n*  strongly encouraged to mandate the pilot training identified in the 737 MAX FSB report as a minimum starting point\n* be responsible for the continued airworthiness and continued operational safety (COS) of aircraft on its registry \n\nThe rest of the report breaks down in engineering terms what is wrong and how it is going to be fixed.\n\n**TL;DR: FAA is making BA rework all of its 737 MAXs. BA will likely be taking those cost directly out of its own profit margins. Buy calls / stock on their top suppliers, who BA will have to pay for all the new equipment\\***\n\n[**BA TOP SUPPLIERS**](https://csimarket.com/stocks/competitionNO4.php?supply&amp;code=BA)\n\n* TAITRON COMPONENTS - TAIT (no options)\n* MSFT - whatever you retards are buying for Tik Tok is fine. Leaps will be good here as well\n* TSM - Jan21 80c should work. if you are cheap do 90\n* Intel - more importantly AMD is a supplier and they will eat intel's lunch. Dell and IBM also provide them chips.\n* other big defense companies that subcontract, LMT, NOC, RTX etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\\*DISCLAIMER**: I am not an engineer, I am a retarded PFA for a DFEN company. I do not have any active positions from above. I will be waiting for a red day to get in.",

I'm not predicting a second crash, just looking for companies that are likely to decline no matter what. In a crash, they'll just decline more steeply, offsetting losses to long positions... in theory.\n\nFor example, I was thinking of buying puts in MAC ($7-ish)  back when it was around $35. They had been in decline for a long time while their competitors were doing fine.\n\nMaybe INTC? I don't think their troubles will be over soon. If Apple shows that custom ARM chips are superior, others will jump ship. ARM is making inroads even in the enterprise market.  (If NVDA does buy ARM, that would give them a huge advantage: long NVDA. Also long TSM as the actual manufacturer of Apple's custom silicon, but damn it, I should be looking for shorts!)\n\nNNN: It's already gone down quite a lot, but they are still paying a hefty dividend.

MU looks like it's been trading sideways for a while despite all the AMD/Intel bullshit, so is it going to pop soon or what?\n\nI don't like doing research, or learning about the stock market because this shit is gay and rigged. I just like overhearing things from smart people and YOLO'ing calls on them. It has actually made me hundreds of thousands of dollars in a couple years so I think my strategy works quite well actually.\n\nThinking about buying a ton of 80c 1/15... smart or retarded?",

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 24th, 2020.\n\n# **Markets look to the Fed again to build on S&amp;P 500 record as Congress continues to disappoint  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/21/markets-look-to-the-fed-again-to-build-on-sp-500-record-as-congress-continues-to-disappoint.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Market pros hold out little hope that Congress will agree to a stimulus package before September, but they will look to Jerome Powell in the coming week to provide a roadmap for what else the Fed might do to help the economy.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed holds its annual Jackson Hole symposium starting Thursday, and it will conduct the Kansas City Fed-sponsored meeting virtually rather than against the backdrop of the Grand Tetons as it normally does at this time of year. The Fed chairman speaks Thursday morning on the implications for monetary policy and the Fed\u2019s anticipated policy framework review.\n*****\n&gt; The past week was a big week for markets, with the S&amp;P 500 finally recovering its losses from the pandemic selloff and setting new all-time highs. Stocks have been big beneficiaries of the Fed\u2019s easy policies and low interest rates, and Fed officials are widely expected to sound dovish when they meet in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think we know the Fed\u2019s all in. If anything they want the mechanicals to work right,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cThe basic Fed policy is crystal clear. You\u2019re going to have low rates for the foreseeable future. They will do whatever it takes.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But Fed watchers expect Powell to go further than the Fed\u2019s already extraordinary support for the economy and financial conditions, and offer guidance on new language and policies that will help the markets understand how long it might hold those low rates and extraordinary policies in place.\n*****\n&gt; For instance, the Fed was expected to provide a more explicit forward guidance policy, and it could also introduce inflation averaging, meaning the Fed could specify that it could both undershoot and overshoot its 2% inflation target. Inflation has only occasionally surpassed its target over the past dozen years, since the financial crisis.\n*****\n&gt; Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays, said he expects the Fed will introduce forward guidance and average inflation targeting at its September meeting. He expects the Fed\u2019s policy review to examine all of its policies to determine which work best in different circumstances.\n*****\n&gt; Since the markets collapsed in February and March, the Fed has cut rates to zero and helped increase liquidity with different facilities for different areas of the capital markets like commercial paper, municipal bonds and corporate bonds. It also created lending programs and continues to buy a large amount of Treasury securities and mortgages. Its balance sheet has now ballooned to $7 trillion.\n*****\n&gt; With average inflation targeting, the Fed would allow the economy and inflation to run hotter than target, without immediately taking steps to tighten policy, according to Jim Caron, fixed income portfolio manger with Morgan Stanley Investment Management.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat they\u2019re saying is if the economy starts to recover, let\u2019s say we get a vaccine, or the rate of infection goes down, and the equity market is on a tear, they\u2019re not going to stop it,\u201d said Caron. \u201cThey\u2019re going to stay there for awhile. That\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to communicate.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Where\u2019s the stimulus?\n&gt; As markets await clarity from the Fed, market pros are expecting less from Congress after first initially anticipating a stimulus package by early August.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAt this point, the thing I\u2019m most thinking about is are we going to get a stimulus deal or not,\u201d said Keon. \u201cI think the politics are shifting beneath that.\u201d He said some Republicans in Congress may be less inclined to spend on a big package ahead of the election.\n*****\n&gt; Democrats and Republicans have been far apart in terms of the contents of the package. One hot button issue is the $600 supplemental weekly aid for the unemployed. It expired on July 31, and Republicans want to cut it to $200 a week while Democrats want to keep current levels. The White House meanwhile has moved to provide $300 a week in aid from FEMA funds but the states have to process those payments.\n*****\n&gt; The two parties are also still far apart on the size of the package, after initially starting out with Democrats at $3 trillion and Republicans with $1 trillion.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cSome folks are discovering their inner budget hawks. It looks like the positions of the two sides are moving further away rather than closer together,\u201d said Keon. \u201cAs the election moves up on us, the possibilities of a deal are going down...the markets are slowly moving toward the idea we don\u2019t get stimulus deal and we might get a Biden presidency. It\u2019s not panicking about it.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The Democratic party held its convention this past week, formally nominating former vice president Joseph Biden to head the Democratic ticket. The Republican convention begins Monday. Biden leads President Donald Trump by an average 7.4 percentage points in the major polls, according to RealClearPolitics.com.\n*****\n&gt; Michael Schumacher, director rate strategy at Wells Fargo, said he too is becoming more skeptical a stimulus deal will get done. \u201cAs the election season gets going, it appears to be getting harder and harder, not from a timing standpoint but from a lack of goodwill standpoint,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said if the economic data weakens, that could hurt stocks and get Congress back to negotiating a new package. There had been expectations a package would include a one-time payment for individuals and families, enhanced unemployment payments and aid for state and local governments.\n*****\n&gt; Raymond James Washington policy analyst Ed Mills said the two sides are likely to come together, but without a catalyst forcing them it may wait until they need to pass a continuing resolution on the budget Sept. 30. \u201cDemocrats are not going to allow for an appropriations bill to pass that does not include additional support for the economy,\u201d said Mills.\n*****\n&gt; # It\u2019s the economy\n&gt; There is some key data in the week ahead that should show how manufacturing and the consumer are faring.\n*****\n&gt; Durable good is reported Wednesday, while personal income and spending data is reported Friday. Consumer confidence is Tuesday and consumer sentiment is released Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Energy markets will be keeping a close eye on two tropical storms that are heading into the Gulf of Mexico and could make landfall early Wednesday. One storm, Laura is tracking close to Florida, and a second storm, possibly to be named Marco looks to be heading across the Yucatan Peninsula before entering the Gulf.\n*****\n&gt; It would be unprecedented in the era of satellites and modern hurricane tracking technology for two storms to arrive within 24 hours. The Weather Channel reports there was such an occurrence in September, 1933.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/0FgKliy.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/yHvkn2w.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/L2S9kUV.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/kgk42Nv.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cMOmbjC.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kCvYfYX.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jwR8nq6.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nSC6K2N.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/YSNdrT9T/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/bwcCQMYv/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/yxfJ72fy/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/3Nr453Zw/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # September Almanac: Only Modest Improvement in Election Years\n\n&gt; Start of business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Sizable gains in September 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2017 have lifted Russell 2000 to second worst (since 1979). September was creamed four years straight from 1999-2002 after four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble buildup.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e4e433c87c6e4c76cefda4ccffbf5ab0/cfdd6d36ba180c35-7f/s400x600/836cc65ffaba5c46d56ea4566614d200638be344.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Bullish election-year forces do little to improve on September\u2019s poor overall performance over the same time frame. September\u2019s performance does improve slightly in election years, but it is still negative nearly across the board. Only the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have been able to escape negative territory and post modest 0.2% and 0.8% average gains respectively in the last ten election year Septembers.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5 Charts To See With Stocks At New Highs\n\n&gt; \u201cBetter late than never.\u201d\n\n&gt; It took a while, but the S&amp;P 500 Index finally made a new all-time high, coming all the way back from the vicious 34% bear market in less than six months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pic-8.19.20-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It might bring back some scary memories, but back in March it took the S&amp;P 500 only 16 days to go from new highs to a bear market (down 20%), the fastest ever.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThis will go down as the fastest bear market ever, but also one of the fastest recoveries ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThen again, we\u2019ve never quite seen a recession and recovery like this, so maybe it isn\u2019t a shock to see new highs this quickly.\u201d\n\n&gt; The bear officially lasted one month and took five months to recover the losses. Usually when there\u2019s a bear market during a recession, it takes 30 months to recover those loses. This was the third-fastest ever, with only 3 months to recover from a bear market recession in the early \u201880s and 4 months to recover from a bear market in the early \u201890s.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It seems like earlier this year and new highs were a lifetime ago, but the S&amp;P 500 finally moved off unlucky 13, notching the 14th new high of 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, returns after a long time without new highs actually get better. One, three, six, and 12 months after the first new high in more than five months show stronger performance than average or after any new highs. Yet another reason to think that this bull market from a long-term point of view could have some more tricks up its sleeve.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Last, we found there were four other times the S&amp;P 500 made a new high during a recession: In February \u201961, July \u201980, November \u201982, and March \u201991. Incredibly, a new expansion started the following month every single time. Could stocks at new highs be signaling an end to this recession? We think that very well could be the case again this time.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Largest S&amp;P 500 Stocks + Tesla (TSLA)\n\n&gt; Tesla (TSLA) is now up 50% over the last 10 calendar days dating back to August 11th. This has propelled the company way up the list of the largest US companies.\n\n&gt; Below is a table of the largest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 with Tesla (TSLA) included. As shown, Tesla's $382.7 billion market cap would rank it as the 9th largest stock in the S&amp;P 500 were it in the index.\n\n&gt; On August 11th, Tesla's market cap was just $256 billion, so over the last ten days it has leapfrogged companies like Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), JP Morgan (JPM), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Mastercard (MA), and NVIDIA (NVDA). Next up would be Visa (V) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), which have market caps just under $400 billion.

Tips - Earnings Season and Top Triple Plays\n\n&gt; Walmart (WMT) wrapped up the Q2 2020 earnings reporting period on Tuesday with a huge beat on both the top and bottom line. It was a fitting end to what turned out to be a record-setting earnings season.\n\n&gt; As we highlighted in our Q2 Earnings Season preview in early July, analysts were rapidly increasing earnings estimates leading up to earnings season. Normally when that happens, stocks have trouble performing well during earnings season because the expectations bar has been set higher. This season, even with analyst estimates on the rise in the four weeks leading up to the start of the reporting period, companies managed to beat bottom-line EPS estimates at the highest rate in the history of our database going back to 1999.\n\n&gt; As shown below, 76% of companies reported stronger-than-expected EPS numbers this season, which eclipsed the prior record high of 73% seen during the Q3 2006 reporting period.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/beatratesbyquarter.png))**\n\n&gt; Long-term Bespoke subscribers know how much we like earnings triple plays, but for those that haven\u2019t heard of the term, we came up with it back in the mid-2000s. An earnings triple play is a company that beats EPS estimates, beats revenue estimates, and raises forward guidance all in the same quarterly earnings report. Investopedia.com is one of the best online resources for financial markets education, and they\u2019ve actually given us credit for coining the \u201ctriple play\u201d term on their website. We consider triple play stocks to be the cream of the crop of earnings season, and we are constantly finding new long-term buy opportunities from this basket of names each quarter.\n\n&gt; This earnings season there were a massive number of earnings triple plays. We went through the list of this season's triple plays to find the ones that have the most attractive set-ups heading into the earnings off-season.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending August 21st, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGhxT3rxKxc))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 8.23.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCwfvNh2iXU))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$BBY** \n&gt; * **$DG** \n&gt; * **$CRM** \n&gt; * **$DLTR** \n&gt; * **$INTU** \n&gt; * **$DKS** \n&gt; * **$MDT** \n&gt; * **$PANW** \n&gt; * **$SJM** \n&gt; * **$ICLK** \n&gt; * **$OKTA** \n&gt; * **$MRVL** \n&gt; * **$ADSK** \n&gt; * **$HRL** \n&gt; * **$WDAY** \n&gt; * **$BIG** \n&gt; * **$COTY** \n&gt; * **$ULTA** \n&gt; * **$BOX** \n&gt; * **$SPLK**\n&gt; * **$BNS** \n&gt; * **$TOL** \n&gt; * **$VMW** \n&gt; * **$BMO** \n&gt; * **$TD** \n&gt; * **$VEEV** \n&gt; * **$HPE** \n&gt; * **$DELL** \n&gt; * **$BILI** \n&gt; * **$BURL** \n&gt; * **$PLCE** \n&gt; * **$ANF** \n&gt; * **$OLLI** \n&gt; * **$PLAN** \n&gt; * **$FLWS** \n&gt; * **$VIOT** \n&gt; * **$RY** \n&gt; * **$HPQ** \n&gt; * **$SOL** \n&gt; * **$BITA** \n&gt; * **$ATHM** \n&gt; * **$NTAP**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/YSNdrT9T/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/FKXPQh9j/ervol1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST INCREASE IN EARNINGS EXPECTATIONS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/G3q2ZwT4/erincrease1.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.24.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RwgQ9SD.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/mvBOGth.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.25.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/aY6k2e0.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.25.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/rx2gJbQ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.26.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/zKSTcN5.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.26.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/B3hFxJN.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.27.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wqQ6cS6.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Tln4z5V.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.28.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7xetbo6.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.28.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best Buy Co., Inc. $114.00\n&gt; **Best Buy Co., Inc.

        "selftext": "Microchip is a semiconductor company out of Arizona with a Mkt. Cap of about $26 Billion. They make chips for a bunch of products like Cyber Security, Wireless Products, and Telecommunications. The thing is that they earnings on 08/04 Tuesday after hours. It is very obvious that are going to beat earnings. Why? Because look at the rest of the industry: Qualcomm, Intel, AMD, Qorvo, and IBM have all destroyed earnings. And since Intel just told everyone that they're too retarded to even make potato chips all the smaller time semiconductor competitors are making bank, example: AMD and QCOM. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMicrochip isn't just your run of the mill small back water company. They actually make acquisitions of other chip companies and use their intellectual property to increase the quality and market share of their own chips. Microchip was found in 1989 and has since made 16 acquistions!!! \n\nYou may, for some reason, say that only big boy chip companies are gonna beat earnings. Well if you don't believe me think about the industries that depend on Microchip for their needs: online educational servicing companies, cloud servicing companies, cyber security companies, telecommunications companies, and just software/tech companies in general. What the hell do we already know about these industries from earnings season? We know they absolutely massacred earnings estimates as everything during COVID has gone tech. Yes, the age of actual industry is dead. Now there are only tech companies that get pumped because of sky high demand (looking at you Apple) and Amazon that sells random shit and still has a tech company valuation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh and you know what's awesome because we have all this knowledge? MCHP is expected to post $1.43 EPS on tuesday, but last year on this quarter they posted $1.41 EPS. What a fucking joke, we should expect at least 40-50% growth in that number from COVID induced semiconductor demand. Not to mention, I think MCHP is gaining market share and could be a big player in a few years in the semiconductor industry. \n\nYou might be hesitant because of my last post on $TER, a chip supplier that many people played incorrectly. I say to you, fuck you. I made money on that play because I sold directly at market open after they destroyed earnings like my data said they would. So if you feel even the slightest FOMO look at these charts from last week: QCOM, QRVO, and AMD; and then tell me what you think MCHP (the same industry) will do!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; MCHP $107c 08/07",

        "selftext": "Well, I've officially made my first, second, and third million from PRPL (I called it [right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gs7mjl/prpl_more_dd_for_you_autists/) two months ago).   My net liquidity in PRPL as of Friday close is $2,622,131,72.   That, along with the $380k I've taken out, I'm at just over $3M.   At this point, when you take into account all the stupid moves I made when I first found this sub, I'm now playing with house money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Has PRPL Memed Yet?\n\nNo.   It hasn't.   Not yet.   \n\nI'm kind of getting tired of answering this in PMs, so please don't ask me if it is too late to invest.   This hasn't memed and I believe we will be in the $25-27 range easily after earnings just by fundamentals alone (assuming the previous low visibility on the stock).   As visibility increases, I think the valuation multiple increases, and not past fundamentals.   We will see higher if this becomes a no longer under-the-radar stock.\n\nThis isn't a meme yet, and it is no where close.\n\nHow do we know?   Let's look at the ultimate source of truth on the subject:  [Robintrack](https://robintrack.net/symbol/PRPL).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lzr2qdg4kne51.png?width=1889&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46997d3050986a77c318c7c9e17ceb39cf8b7f91\n\nAs you can see, we've seen a significant influx of Robinhood tards in the last few days, but this isn't memeing, yet.\n\nIf you check the [Robintrack popularity changes](https://robintrack.net/popularity_changes?hoursAgo=168) over the last week, PRPL comes in at #113 most popular in terms of user growth.    That isn't very high at all.   It's surrounded by other stocks you've never heard of.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j2376iielne51.png?width=576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ea7b7afb1b7de17dd2f36d4bde3f5f17c0ebf5d\n\nThis is hardly meme worthy yet.   Compare this to KODK:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u62x1fgdmne51.png?width=585&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83b16c21e2b56c23818b6a48c97ee0410c12047a\n\nWe should also compare PRPL to two recents meme stocks:  SPCE and DKNG.   As a side note, all three of these stocks came from SPACs BTW, hence the warrants.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ne6lwwnvpne51.png?width=1892&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e97dba747dc51ec779ef8a8a5640f72257313798\n\nSPCE shot up to about 92,000 Robintards very quickly, which drove the price up.   When the rate of Robintard increases declined and flattened out, the stock dropped.   There are now 150k Robintards holding.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0xndxysxpne51.png?width=1890&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4db5e52718775e5b30ffe74d59784f34395600c\n\nDKNG shot up to about 100,000 Robintards investing on the meme run up, and still has about 120k still in.  The meme drop off is less pronounced on DKNG because, unlike SPCE, they have this thing called \"Revenue\".\n\nKODK, SPCE, and DKNG all had run ups to about 100k Robintards driving the meme up in price way over fundamentals.   PRPL only has 6,600 Robintards, and the current price is fully supported by fundamentals (see some of my previous posts and u/dhsmatt2's previous posts if you want support on that statement).\n\nSo, no, it isn't a meme.   Keep tabs on this though as Robintard entry could definitely cause this to meme up (and we may very well be in the early stages of this right now).   Buy calls now and sell when we start getting close to 100k Robintards.\n\n# Financial Analysis\n\nI think u/dhsmatt2 did a pretty good job [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i0zaqh/prpl_nurples_why_purple_valuation_just_might_make/?sort=new).   My only two comments are:  1)  I think his revenue estimate is low (mine:  $244m, his $225M), and 2)  the warrant liability accrual won't be recurring at the same level (we will see one big bang this quarter and then a wimper going forward until the warrants are gone--so his forward EPS estimate should be higher on his math).\n\nMy revenue estimates:\n\n||Q2 Total|June|May|April|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Direct-to-Consumer (DTC)|*205.0*|*80.0*|**71.0**|**54.0**|\n|Wholesale Partner|*39.0*|*19.0*|**17.3**|*2.7*|\n||||||\n|Total|*244.0 M*|*99.0*|**88.3**|*56.7*|\n\nThe bold numbers are known for sure as they were disclosed.   The italicized are my estimates.\n\nI'm putting June DTC as an acceleration over May because of the following:\n\n1. The website still showed significant delays in delivery, which means they were still selling every mattress they make.\n2. Extra manufacturing capacity came online at the beginning of June.\n3. Purple discontinued its lower end models, which would cause a mix shift up in revenue per unit when selling at capacity.\n\nI may be underestimating this as well.\n\nI placed wholesale where it was at because it is still recovering and Joe Megibow [said in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP8ggnn9nK8&amp;feature=youtu.be) that they were almost flat of wholesale year over year at this point.\n\n# Valuations\n\nI'm copying this [from a previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hig038/i_bought_six_prpl_mattresses_today_you_should_buy/), even though the data is slightly dated now after TPX and SNBR had their releases.\n\n**Enterprice Value / Revenue**\n\n|Ticker|As of 6/28/20|2020 Q1|2019 Q4|2019 Q3|2019 Q2|2019 Q1|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|PRPL|2.01|2.52|3.94|3.61|3.73|3.09|\n|TPX|1.71|4.84|7.39|7.34|8.07|6.88|\n|SNBR|0.98|2.36|4.40|3.79|4.97|3.78|\n|CSPR|0.53|0.91|||||\n\nBased upon the chart, I don't see a 2x multiple on revenue as unreasonable at all for PRPL, and arguably, it should be higher due to the acceleration in growth rate.\n\nThe Q2 revenue pattern will continue into Q3 and beyond (they are still backed up on delivery on several products).   Additionally, they will be bringing substantial capacity online in the next year to support sales.   I see PRPL producing $800M-$1,200M in revenue over the next year as we see continued capacity growth, shift into higher end mattresses, and continued expansion on both DTC and wholesale doors.\n\nClearly, it is easy to justify the $1.32B valuation as of close Friday, and arguably, much higher.\n\n# Positions\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kza0j31utne51.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcb053f5300205be309cdf19b4fbc23a7a6df276\n\nA bunch of warrants and call debit spreads.  \n\n# Recommendations\n\nI don't have any recommendations.   Go talk to your investment advisor as this isn't investment advice.   What am I looking at right now?   Debit spreads.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6hv4gez1une51.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8bdb7c9ecd0ae6730e95732434687b2ecc56a11\n\nIf you took the ask, you can pick up a 20/22.5c debit spread for only $1.70.   It pays out $2.50 as long as the stock stays above $22.50 after earnings (likelihood is extremely high as the stock is currently at $24.37).\n\nFor those of you who are asking what to do or wondering if it is too late to make money:   that is an example conservative position to take even if you think the stock will be flat from here on out till earnings (it won't be).\n\nMy bet is that it continues to grow each day on a run up.   I'll be watching Robintrack very closely on the run up.    My plan is to hold through earnings, unless we meme up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# PRPL GANG FTW!!!",

        "selftext": "That's right, your monthly update on the sector that the majority of people seem to hate and has a total market cap almost equal to that of Pinterest. Yes, even I was suprised about this. A sector that provides fuel for powering 20% of the entire US and around 10% of all power generation globally has a combined market cap equivalent to a website where you can look for pictures of furniture (extremely simplified but you get the point).\n\nBut I digress, for those of you who have not read my previous updates and DD, [here](https://amp.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hp9966/the_case_for_a_big_uranium_bull_market_and_what/) is a general market analysis and five stock suggestions, [here](https://amp.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/huo47l/uranium_miners_are_showing_big_growth_with_many/) is a market update and lastly [here](https://amp.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/i2bf4d/the_sector_that_returned_20x_50x_100x_and_even/) another update explaining the bullish views and recent drop. I would highly suggest you read these first before asking questions, since they will probably answer most questions you may have in the post itself or between the hundreds of comments. If you do have more questions, I will be more than happy to answer them for you.\n\nNow, let's move on to the big one, what is happening in the sector? Well it looks like 2021 is going to be the year all catalysts come together to form one incredible bull market for uranium. \n\nKazatomprom has publicly announced that their supply in 2021 will be severely impacted. Why is that? Because ISR mining in Kazakhstan is a lot like planting crops. A mining solution has to be put into the ground, which will go into the ore bodies and after between 4 and 7 months the solution can be pumped back out together with the uranium ore. The only problem is that the main 'seeding' months where between April and September, right before Kazakhstan winter. They have now missed their main mining time of the year, which means little to no new uranium will be pulled out of the ground next year for the first time in a long long time. With Kazakhstan responsible for just around 40% of the entire global supply of uranium, this impact will translate into a major supply deficit on top of the already existing supply deficit. This year it is estimated that there will be around 120 million pounds of uranium produced, where 180 million pounds was demanded. This means that inventory and mobile supply had to be used to fill this gap, further tightening the global supply of uranium. Let's talk about the wildest situation, which would be every single uranium producer, including at Olympic Dam, just ramps up to full capacity and sell everything into the market at whatever the current price is. Will that drop the price a bit? Sure it will. Will it take care of the deficit and prevent this bull market from happening? Absolutely not.\n\nIf this structural deficit happened to any other commodity, the price would absolutely skyrocket. So why hasn't uranium? Because there has been almost no talk of nuclear utilities, the main consumer of uranium, coming into the market to buy new fuel. This will change in 2021 and especially 2022 when 40% and 80% of all utilities in the US respectively will be out of contract and thus not getting their all important fuel for the nuclear power plants.\n\nThis contracting cycle comes at the same time as the biggest supply deficit we have yet seen, the closing of several high profile uranium mines, like Orano's Cominak mine, the lack of new uranium mines for at least the next 2/3 years and above all the increasing demand for uranium all across the globe make this entire sector a coiled spring. We do not know when it will go off, but the longer it stays this way the higher the jump and this jump will come. My guess is that there are several small bumps this year and that there will be a huge jump next year which will trigger a bull market that may even eclipse the likes of 2002-2007 and will last between 2-4 years depending on how long it takes for all utilities to sign new contracts and the market to be supplied well again, after which the market will come back down to 'normal levels'.\n\nLastly, there have been index funds who are restructuring their holdings to have more pure play exposure to uranium. $URA will move from 50% to 70%, adding 32 million dollars to the sector. With a sector that had such a small market cap, inflow of capital like this can move the needle substantially. Just imagine what will happen when the general investment community and all those people who made millions in the previous bull market decide to invest into the sector. That will do more than just moving the needle or spring the coil, that would put the needle and the coil into a cannon.\n\nAll signs point to this being the most asymmetrical risk/reward investment you can find in the market. I will not deny the risk it brings, but the potential rewards are so large that they easily write off any risk that might be involved investing in this sector. When all is set and done, those that invested early and held on through all the volatility will be greatly rewarded for their troubles.\n\nExtras:\nI highly suggest checking out people like Brandon Munro, the uranium insider, John Quackes, Crux Investor, Rob Chang and especially Mike Alkin who all have extensive information on the sector and the investment thesis.\n\nDisclaimer:\nUranium holds a 25% spot in my total portfolio, with significant positions in Cameco (CCO), Denison Mines (DNN) and Energy Fuels (UUUU).",

Any other date is wrong.  Robinhood is wrong (why are you using Robinhood still!?!).\n\nI'm going to take you through my earnings projections and reasoning as well the things to look for in the earnings release and the call that could make this moon even further.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Earnings Estimates\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w3qad4gb9ng51.png?width=854&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a88656a9867d0e40710736f61974a22b5f4a631\n\nI'm calling $244M Net Revenue with $39.75M in Net Income, which would be $0.75 Diluted EPS.  I'll walk you through how I got here\n\n# Total Net Revenue\n\nI make the assumption that Purple is still selling every mattress it can make (since that is what they said for April and May) and that this continued into June because the website was still delayed 7-14 days across all mattresses at the end of June.\n\n**May Revenue and April DTC:**  The numbers in purple were provided by Purple [here](https://investors.purple.com/press-releases/news-details/2020/Purple-Innovation-Reports-Record-First-Quarter-2020-Results/default.aspx) and [here](https://investors.purple.com/press-releases/news-details/2020/Purple-Innovation-Provides-Business-Update-Ahead-of-Participation-in-Oppenheimer-20th-Annual-Consumer-Growth-Conference/default.aspx).  \n\n**April Wholesale:**  My estimate of $2.7M for Wholesale sales in April comes from this statement from the Q1 earnings release:  \" *While wholesale sales were down 42.7% in April year-over-year, weekly wholesale orders have started to increase on a sequential basis.* \"  I divided Q2 2019's wholesale sales evenly between months and then went down 42.7%.\n\n**June DTC:**  This is my estimate based upon the fact that another Mattress Max machine went online June 1, thus increasing capacity, and the low end model was discontinued (raising revenue per unit).\n\n**June Wholesale:**  [Joe Megibow stated at Commerce Next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP8ggnn9nK8&amp;feature=emb_logo) on 7/30 that wholesale had returned to almost flat growth.  I'm going to assume he meant for the quarter, so I plugged the number here to finish out the quarter at $39.0M, just under $39.3M from a year ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Revenue Expectations from Analysts** ([via Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PRPL/analysis?p=PRPL))\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/notxd6hhbng51.png?width=384&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa0453414f467aa6c5bf72ce8a8046c0ae6e62a5\n\nMy estimate of $244M comes in way over the high, let alone the consensus.   PRPL has effectively already disclosed \\~$145M for April/May, so these expectations are way off.  I'm more right than they are.\n\n# Gross Margins\n\nI used my estimates for Q3/Q4 2019 to guide margins in April/May as there were some one time events that occurred in Q1 depressing margins.   June has higher margin because of the shift away from the low end model (which is priced substantially lower than the high end model).   Higher priced models were given manufacturing priority.\n\n# Operating Expenses\n\n**Marketing and Sales**\n\nJoe mentioned in the [Commerce Next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP8ggnn9nK8&amp;feature=emb_logo) video that they were able to scale sales at a constant CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost).   There's three ways of interpreting this:\n\n1. Overall customer acquisition cost was constant with previous quarters (assume $36M total, not $93.2M), which means you need to add another $57M to bottom line profit and $1.08 to EPS, or\n2. Customer Acquisition Costs on a unit basis were constant, which means I'm still overstating total marketing expense and understating EPS massively, or\n3. Customer Acquisition Costs on a revenue basis were constant, which is the most conservative approach and the one I took for my estimate.\n\nI straightlined the 2.2 ratio of DTC sales to Marketing costs from Q1.   I am undoubtably too high in my expense estimate here as PRPL saw marketing efficiencies and favorable revenue shifts during the quarter.  So, $93.2M\n\n**General and Administrative**\n\nA Purple HR rep [posted on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6691037138018017280/) about hiring 330 people in the quarter.   I'm going to assume that was relative to the pre-COVID furloughs, so I had June at that proportional amount to previous employees and adjusted April and May for furloughs and returns from furlough.\n\n**Research and Development**\n\nI added just a little here and straight lined it.\n\n# Other Expenses\n\n**Interest Expense**\n\nStraightlined from previous quarters, although they may have tapped ABL lines and so forth, so this could be under.\n\n**One Time and Other**\n\nUnpredictable by nature.\n\n**Warrant Liability Accrual**\n\nI'm making some assumptions here.   \n\n1. We know that the secondary offering event during Q2 from the Pearce brothers triggered the clause for the loan warrants (NOT the PRPLW warrants) to lower the strike price to $0.\n2. I can't think of a logical reason why the warrant holders wouldn't exercise at this point.\n3. Therefore there is no longer a warrant liability where the company may need to repurchase warrants back.\n4. The liability accrual of $7.989M needs to be reversed out for a gain.\n\nThis sucker is worth about $0.15 EPS on its own.\n\n# Earnings (EPS)\n\nI project $39.75M or $0.75 Diluted EPS (53M shares).  How does this hold up to the analysts?\n\n**EPS Expectations from Analysts** ([via Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PRPL/analysis?p=PRPL))\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o2i1dvk6hng51.png?width=373&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27e63f7934d85393e1f7b87bf2e2066c28047202\n\n**EPS Expectations from Analysts** ([via MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/PRPL/earnings/))\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/psu5rajfhng51.png?width=1359&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0612d43777c644789b14f8c5decbe36f41925f5e\n\nThese losers are way under.   Now you know why I am so optimistic about earnings.\n\nKeep in mind, these analysts are still giving $28-$30 price targets.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What to Watch For During Earnings (aka Reasons Why This Moons More)\n\nAnalysts, Institutionals, and everyone else who uses math for investing is going to be listening for the following:\n\n* Margin Growth\n* Warrant Liability Accrual\n* Capacity Expansion Rate\n* CACs (Customer Acquisition Costs)\n* New Product Categories\n* Cashless Exercise of PRPLW warrants\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Margin Growth**\n\nThis factor is HUGE.  If PRPL guides to higher margins due to better sales mix and continued DTC shift, then every analyst and investor is going to tweak their models up in a big way.   Thus far, management has been relatively cautious about this fortuitous shift to DTC continuing.   [If web traffic is any indicator](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i7gjsn/prpl_q2_revenue_forecast_using_web_traffic/), it will, but we need management to tell us that.\n\n**Warrant Liability Accrual**\n\nI could be dead wrong on my assumptions above on this one.   If it stays, there will be questions about it due to the drop in exercise price.   It does impact GAAP earnings (although it shouldn't--stupid accountants).\n\n**Capacity Expansion Rate**\n\nThis is a BIG one as well.   As PRPL has been famously capacity constrained: their rate of manufacturing capacity expansion is their growth rate over the next year.  PRPL discontinued expansion at the beginning of COVID and then re-accelerated it to a faster pace than pre-COVID by hurrying the machines in-process out to the floor.   They also signed their [manufacturing space deal](https://investors.purple.com/press-releases/news-details/2020/Purple-Expands-U.S.-Manufacturing-with-a-New-Facility-in-Georgia/default.aspx) which has nearly doubled manufacturing space a quarter early.   The REAL question is when the machines will start rolling out.   Previous guidance was end of the year at best.   If we get anything sooner than that, we are going to ratchet up.\n\n**CACs (Customer Acquisition Costs)**\n\nSince DTC is the new game in town, we are all going to want to understand exactly where marketing expenses were this quarter and, more importantly, where management thinks they are going.   The magic words to listen for are \"marketing efficiencies\".   Those words means the stock goes up.  This is the next biggest line item on the P&amp;L besides revenue and cost of goods sold.\n\n**New Product Categories**\n\nWe [heard the VP of Brand](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/256-authentic-influence-31157510/episode/purple-vp-of-brand-burke-morley-67762598/) from Purple give us some touchy-feely vision of where the company is headed and that mattresses was just the revenue generating base to empower this.   I'm hoping we hear more about this.    This is what differentiated Amazon from Barnes and Noble:  Amazon's vision was more than just books.   Purple sees itself as more than just mattresses.   Hopefully we get some announced action behind that vision.   This multiplies the stock.\n\n**Cashless Exercise of PRPLW Warrants**\n\nI doubt this will be answered, even if the question is asked.   I bet they wait until the 20 out of 30 days is up and they deliver notice.   We could be pleasantly surprised.   If management informs us that they will opt for cashless exercise of the warrants, this is anti-dilutive to EPS.   It will reduce the number of outstanding shares and automatically cause an adjustment up in the stock price (remember kids, some people use math when investing).   I'm hopeful, but not expecting it.   The amount of the adjustment depends on the current price of the stock.    Also, I fully expect PRPL management to use their cashless exercise option at the end of the 20 out of 30 days as they are already spitting cash.\n\n# Positions\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tho65crvkng51.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6241ff5e8b26744f9d7119ddef7da86f163c741d\n\nI'm not just holding, I added.\n\nPRPLW Warrants:  391,280\n\nPRPL Call Debit Spreads:   17.5c/25c 8/21 x90, 20c/25c 8/21 x247\n\nAlso, I bought some CSPR 7.5p 8/21 x200 for fun because I think that sucker is going to get shamed back down to $6 after a real mattress company shows what it can do.",

Also, he enacted a payroll tax cut that will be come a grant IF he becomes re-elected. So inflation will continue to rise, oh and the Fed is capping interest rates on bonds. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) Metals compete DIRECTLY with REAL (inflation adjusted) interest rates. As a foundational bedrock investment of  Pensions, Mutual Funds, and general portfolios - people have traditionally held long term bonds.  Metals are a 0% thing, you can't eat them and they are basically a pet rock - but they are stable at 0% forever, as metals were the ORIGINAL money.  If you take the current bond rate, and subtract the inflation rate, you get -1.1%.  This is causing MASSIVE moves in the market as people leave bonds and crowd into metals, as 0% beats the hell out of negative REAL rates.  Currently Gold is at 2100, if we go to -2% REAL rates, Gold will be 2500. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) Learn about Rehypothecation here ([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rehypothecation.asp#:\\~:text=Rehypothecation%20is%20a%20practice%20whereby,or%20a%20rebate%20on%20fees.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rehypothecation.asp#:~:text=Rehypothecation%20is%20a%20practice%20whereby,or%20a%20rebate%20on%20fees.)).  For obvious reasons, this is why housing blew up in 2008.  The exact same thing is happening in Silver, but inversely.  Silver has been abused for so long, but it REALLY started in 2011. The \"classic\" (meaning the mined ratio, or the ratio at which they pull this shit out of the ground) is around 16:1.  In 2005, the ratio was 60:1.  On Friday's close, the Silver/Gold ratio was 79:1.  Silver has a LONG way to catch-up.  At CURRENT levels, Silver SHOULD be (assuming a 60:1 ratio) \\~ 35ish.  So when you look at the fact that Silver has been abused for so long that its undervalued, coupled with the Massive run on metals due to negative REAL rates, Silver has massive upside. The amount of fund inflows into Silver ETF's is another leg up on silver as well - they eventually are going to have to officially re-value silver to reflect fund inflows and sentiment.  Who knows what the new Silver/Gold ratio could end up as...but I'm betting its a LOT lower than 60:1. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4a) Banks will continue to fight us on silver, but they are losing as they were massively short, and the world blew up in their face.  HSBC lost $200M in a single day, and closed their industrial metals business around 6 weeks ago ( [https://www.kitco.com/news/2020-07-03/HSBC-closes-its-industrial-metals-business.html](https://www.kitco.com/news/2020-07-03/HSBC-closes-its-industrial-metals-business.html) ).  Soctiabank also closed down its metals trading desk around 4 months ago ( [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-metals-bank-of-nova-scotia-exclusive/exclusive-scotiabank-to-close-its-metals-business-sources-idUSKCN22A2ZC#:\\~:text=%E2%80%9CScotia%20had%20a%20global%20call,said%20one%20of%20the%20sources.&amp;text=A%20spokeswoman%20for%20Scotiabank%20declined,around%20the%20beginning%20of%202021.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-metals-bank-of-nova-scotia-exclusive/exclusive-scotiabank-to-close-its-metals-business-sources-idUSKCN22A2ZC#:~:text=%E2%80%9CScotia%20had%20a%20global%20call,said%20one%20of%20the%20sources.&amp;text=A%20spokeswoman%20for%20Scotiabank%20declined,around%20the%20beginning%20of%202021.) )  This means the ONLY one left is JPM, and they are still trying to fight us, but are losing and continuing to wind down shorts. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4b) The $1.5 drop we saw Thursday night was exactly this - banks reloading shorts to try and fight us, but there is a big difference. An ALL TIME RECORD amount of shorts were opened on the Comex on Thursday, around 350k contracts....a RECORD amount...and all it did was $1.50 in damage....so that should tell you where sentiment and price action is.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLHLEAbZUA8&amp;t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLHLEAbZUA8&amp;t=1s) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5) Silver is about to go hyperbolic and nothing is in it's way.  The fed is printing money (driving inflation), people are already crowding metals, banks are unwinding their short positions (or closing their metals trading desk all together), and there are HISTORIC inflows into Silver - which will eventually cause a revaluation to the upside.  I'm an EE and I love Technical Analysis, but this is 100% fundamental driven. \n\nA retired energy trader once told me \"Fundamentals will tell you why something is happening, TA will tell you when\".  TA is broken on metals right now and all its doing is making algos and morons try to load shorts.  Multinational global banks are literally leaving the idea of shorting metals, so maybe follow suit?  These are some of the smartest people on earth and I hate bankers, but they aren't dumb.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave a great week.",

        "selftext": "**Disclaimer:** I did not invent this indicator or find this correlation. All credit goes to a very intelligent trader on Twitter named Kerberos007 who might be borderline obsessed with finding data-based crash indicators.\n\n**The Indicator:** Let me be clear. I am by no means a great trader. But I found this guy\u2019s crash thesis and checked it against every SPY crash in recent history that I could. It's deadly accurate. I feel like a chimpanzee trying to explain the concept of why fire burns but if it saves some of you guys from not being able to afford the bubble wrap and capri-suns you love, maybe it\u2019s worth it. If you graph the correlation between the daily value of the SPX and GLD, you will see an interesting pattern emerge. In the period before a market crash, they will begin to have a higher correlation. At some point that correlation will become so positive that it crosses the threshold of 0.6. From what I can see, how long it stays above 0.6 doesn\u2019t really matter. The most important part is that when the correlation starts to break down and returns to 0.6 on the way down, all hell breaks loose within 1-3 days. When it triggers, it doesn\u2019t always mean Armageddon type SPY damage but it will be a significant pullback. For example, you can see that it was triggered on 6/5 which was just a couple days before our last significant pullback.\n\n**Where is it Now:** As of today 8/11/20 the correlation is at .64 and dropping like a rock. I\u2019m not telling you guys to go all in on puts because putting all your faith in one indicator doesn\u2019t make sense. I\u2019m just saying that when that .60 threshold is crossed just make sure you are hedged effectively for at least the next 3 trading days. Maybe just a little more bearish than usual just in case things get froggy.\n\n**TLDR:** Be prepared for a big red day once the correlation between GLD and SPX decreases to 0.60. Good luck my brothers. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/icji9e4gkeg51.png?width=854&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b07cca589a5dd117dbd15a3f8b99c3b4ca286866\n\nP.S.

        "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/10/judge-grants-preliminary-injunction-requiring-uber-and-lyft-to-stop-classifying-drivers-as-contractors.html\n\n&gt; A California judge granted a preliminary injunction Monday requiring Uber and Lyft to stop classifying their drivers as independent contractors pending further action by the court. The order will take effect after 10 days, as the companies requested a brief stay during the appeals process.\n&gt; \n&gt; If upheld, the ruling could have serious implications for Uber and Lyft, both of which are not yet profitable and have seen their ride-hailing businesses suffer during the pandemic. By classifying their drivers as independent workers, rather than employees, the companies have not had to pay for costly benefits that come with a full-time staff. \n&gt; \n&gt; California Attorney General Xavier Becerra requested the injunction as part of a lawsuit he brought in May along with city attorneys from San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego. The suit, filed in San Francisco Superior Court, alleged Uber and Lyft violated the state\u2019s new law known as Assembly Bill 5 (AB5), which was created as a way to classify gig workers as full employees and ensure benefits from their employers. Uber and Lyft were among a group of tech companies that have previously opposed the bill, arguing their workers enjoy the flexibility of creating their own schedules as contractors. \n&gt; \n&gt; California officials sought an injunction on the alleged misclassification and restitution for workers and civil penalties worth up to hundreds of millions of dollars.\n&gt; \n&gt; Shares of Uber were down 0.8% during extended trading Monday and Lyft shares were down 1.7%.\n&gt; \n&gt; Both companies said they would appeal the ruling immediately.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cThe vast majority of drivers want to work independently, and we\u2019ve already made significant changes to our app to ensure that remains the case under California law,\u201d an Uber spokesperson said. \u201cWhen over 3 million Californians are without a job, our elected leaders should be focused on creating work, not trying to shut down an entire industry during an economic depression.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cDrivers do not want to be employees, full stop,\u201d Lyft said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ll immediately appeal this ruling and continue to fight for their independence. Ultimately, we believe this issue will be decided by California voters and that they will side with drivers.\u201d \n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cThe court has weighed in and agreed: Uber and Lyft need to put a stop to unlawful misclassification of their drivers while our litigation continues,\u201d Becerra said in a statement. \u201cWhile this fight still has a long way to go, we\u2019re pushing ahead to make sure the people of California get the workplace protections they deserve. Our state and workers shouldn\u2019t have to foot the bill when big businesses try to skip out on their responsibilities. We\u2019re going to keep working to make sure Uber and Lyft play by the rules.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi advocated for a \u201cthird way\u201d to classify workers in a letter to President Donald Trump in March as the first round of coronavirus relief measures were being negotiated. He argued there should be a way for workers to gain protections without sacrificing the flexibility of contract work.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the ruling, Judge Ethan Schulman recognized the value of flexibility offered by Uber and Lyft, writing, \u201cThe Court does not take lightly Defendants\u2019 showing that a preliminary injunction may also have an adverse effect on some of their drivers, many of whom desire the flexibility to continue working as they have in the past, and may have commitments that make it difficult if not impossible for them to become full-time employees.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; But Schulman wrote that Uber and Lyft\u2019s concerns that the injunction would have \u201cfar-reaching effects\u201d had \u201conly been exacerbated by Defendants\u2019 prolonged and brazen refusal to comply with California law. Defendants may not evade legislative mandates merely because their businesses are so large that they affect the lives of many thousands of people.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; Schulman wrote that any impact of the injunction on Uber and Lyft\u2019s businesses would likely be mitigated by the fact that both have said the \u201cvast majority of their drivers work on a casual or sporadic basis\u201d and the reality that the coronavirus pandemic has \u201cdrastically reduced the demand for Defendants\u2019 services.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cNow, when Defendants\u2019 ridership is at an all-time low, may be the best time (or the least worst time) for Defendants to change their business practices to conform to California law without causing widespread adverse effects on their drivers,\u201d Schulman wrote.\n&gt; \n&gt; Uber and Lyft sought to delay the ruling until there was a ruling on Uber\u2019s constitutional challenge of AB5 or until voters weighed in on a ballot measure they sponsored to exempt them from the law. The Court dismissed those requests.\n&gt; \n&gt; Schulman said Uber\u2019s arguments that drivers\u2019 work was outside the ordinary course of its business, as the standard requires, was \u201ca classic example of circular reasoning.\u201d He summarized the argument as saying that since Uber views itself as a tech company, only its tech workers are its employees.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cWere this reasoning to be accepted, the rapidly expanding majority of industries that rely heavily on technology could with impunity deprive legions of workers of the basic protections afforded to employees by state labor and employment laws,\u201d the judge wrote.\n&gt; \n&gt; The ruling does not end the legal battles for Uber and Lyft, however. Last week, California\u2019s Labor Commissioner announced lawsuits against the companies alleging wage theft due to misclassification. The commission seeks to recover wages it believes were owed to drivers currently classified as contractors. The suits were filed in Alameda County Superior Court.",

        "selftext": "All you autists worried about RKT and will end up paper handing any dips need to wake up. RKT is one of the best deals on the market right now. Here's why:\n\n**RKT will undoubtedly eventually be valued as a Fintech Company.**\n\nWhy? Because it has all the core components of a fintech company. RKT at it's core is a consumer-facing, tech-based mortgage origination platform and it's productivity, Revenue per Employee, and margins are **in line if not better than fintech players**. Let's take a look:\n\n* RKT's Q1 2020 EBITDA Margin was a **blistering 44%!** Compare that other FinTechs latest EBITDA margins \n   * SHOP at negative 1.9%\n   * GWRE at 6%\n   * LMND at negative 73%!\n   * PYPL at 19%\n* RKT has an **Revenue per Employee (as of 3/31/20) figure of $300k**! Again, compare to other Fintechs, RKT is nearly the exact Median\n   * SHOP at $416k / employee\n   * GWRE at $276k / employee\n   * LMND at $251k / employee\n   * PYPL at $828k / employee\n* Now, let's look at the valuation for the other Fintechs. **RKT is very obviously undervalued compared to the segment**\n   * Enterprise Value / Revenue\n      * SHOP - 54.3x LTM Revenue\n      * GWRE - 11.7x LTM Revenue\n      * LMND - 44.3x LTM Revenue\n      * PYPL - 11.4x LTM Revenue\n      * **RKT - 2.2x LTM Revenue**\n   * P/E\n      * SHOP - N/A, negative EPS\n      * GWRE - 333x P/E\n      * LMND - N/A,negative EPS\n      * PYPL - 87x P/E\n      * **RKT - 7.7x P/E**\n\n**But, but, what about the mortgage volume? Isn't RKT exposed to interest rates and mortgage volume?**\n\nPlain and simple, there is no force that is going to stop volume right now. We can all say that fundamentals don't matter and for stock market pricing they may not. But in terms of interest rate action by the Fed, they very much do matter, and it is clear the Fed does not intend to raise rate until fundamentals truly stabilize. And if rates do come up, it will mean even J.Pow &amp; Co think inflation is getting too hot. Fuck SLV gang, **Real Estate is the ultimate anti-inflation safe-haven.** So volume should remain largely unaffected as investors seek inflation protection.\n\n**RKT continues to gain market share in an expanding market**\n\nLet's face it, eventually boomers will not be applying for new mortgages and millennials are not going to walk into Chase with a $100 fountain pen to apply for a mortgage. One of the biggest themes of the housing market today is increasing rate of home ownership among millenials. RKT's completely digitized offering positions them to capitalize on market trends. The numbers prove this as RKT's share of the total mortgage market has increased from 1.3% in 2009 to &gt;9% in the first quarter of 2020, making RKT the **largest mortgage originator in the US.**\n\n**RKT's technology drives faster, better outcomes for end consumer**\n\nRKT's application process can be understood as \"parallel\" vs. the traditional mortgage industry's \"linear\" process. This results in faster approvals and faster closing times. RKT closes loans 25% faster than the industry average - 29 days on average vs. the industry average of 40 days. Not only is this good for the end consumer (instant-gratification millennials), it means RKT's workforce is significantly more efficient than the industry average, closing average of **8.3 loans per month per team member** in YTD 2020 vs. the **industry average of 2.3 per moth per team member**\n\n**In summary, the retail mortgage industry is in desperate need of digitization. RKT is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this need.** After all, who else is going to do this? Penny-fucking-Mac?\n\nTLDR: Go long RKT, I am long shares and will continue to add on dips.",

        "selftext": "I am an absolute noob at trading, let alone options trading.\n\nI wanted to buy 12c 08/21 which was trading at 0.18 at the time. I placed the order for 20 contracts and it would not take the limit of 0.18 on RH, it kept saying that the trade has to be in 5cent increments so I had to place a limit buy with .20 limit. The order executed for 20cents a contract (total $400) and I was already down $40 as soon as the buy executed. So now I waited for the Corn report and knew it was bad. In a bid to minimize my losses I wanted to sell my contracts and they were still trading at 18cents for the 12c 08/21, but then again I was unable to place the sell order with a limit of 0.18 as RH said it had to be in 5cent multiples. So I placed a Limit sell at 0.20\n\nSo I decided to wait it out and see if by any chance the contract would go up in value to 0.20 so I can break even and sell at 0.20. Well the 8/21 calls started dropping in value and suddenly started trading at 0.13 not even 0.15. Now I just decided to sell no matter what and was forced to set limit of .10 since if I set it at 0.15 it would not sell, just like it had not sold at 0.20. So I end up placing sell limit order at 0.10 which executed immediately so my total loss within a span of couple of hours was 50% ($200) of my initial $400 investment.\n\nAm I making some rookie mistake here??",

        "selftext": "Hi, just a quick update on my macro sentiment trading journey. I\u2019ve posted my result here two weeks ago - I had 7 winning trades in a row and my account jumped from $10k to $30k. For those who missed my previous post - in my trades I\u2019m following the narrative that fundamentals now mean nothing since Fed started printing in March. Instead of using FA or TA I\u2019m now using macroeconomic sentiment analysis, which is basically a weekly survey of 150k analysts from 130 countries conducted by some company. They\u2019re asking simple questions like \u201cWhat\u2019s the employment situation in your inner circle: are people losing their jobs and have salary cuts or vice versa\u201d; and post several indicators based on it every week. It\u2019s not an ad so I\u2019m not sharing the company\u2019s name here (unless you ask in DM).\n\nSo, last week was no trade according to sentiments, but this week had a very surprising (for me) guidance - buy calls. I was a bit afraid to follow the call (pun intented) because I think there will be a correction pretty soon. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve bought SPY calls (327 strike) for $3.7-ish on Monday and sold today at $5.5-ish with 50% (about $5k) profit. I also was thinking about selling some 332 strike or so to make a spread, but decided just to take profit (don\u2019t want to reinvent the wheel). So this is my 8 profitable trade in a row (I know other sentiment traders had 12 wins in a row).\n\nI think I\u2019ll continue for a few weeks with the same risk-per-trade and then I\u2019ll increase my risk by two times. What\u2019s your thoughts re sentiment analysis?",

        "selftext": "[Gains](https://imgur.com/gallery/afMJcB4)\n\nI\u2019m very surprised about the lack of attention NVAX gets on this sub considering it has rallied much more than something like TSLA and is a pharmaceutical stock in the middle of a pandemic. Read this and maybe some of you autists can make up the money you lost on MSFT calls and buying KODK at $50.\n\nBackstory:\n\nI have held this stock since 2016 with nothing but diamond hands. In September 2016, they failed their stage 3 clinical trial and fell 84%. In 2019, they issued a 1:20 reverse split. I continued to be optimistic hoping their NanoFlu vaccine could bring some revival to the stock and even doubled down on my initial investment to get my average price down to ~$26. I was rewarded for this once COVID hit.\n\nWhy NVAX?\n\nNVAX was one of the first of the operation warp speed companies to receive significant funding, and they will be a key player in the development of a vaccine. It has, by far had the biggest % gain of all the warp speed companies. \n\nThey will be releasing their phase 1 clinical trial results after hours today.\n\nThe reason NVAX will be more successful than any of the other pharmaceuticals/biotechs is because they already have technology and experience from previous attempts in the type of vaccine that will be used. They use their owned recombinant nanoparticle technology to generate antigen derived from the coronavirus spike (S) protein and contains Novavax\u2019 patented saponin-based Matrix-M.\n\nNVAX, without any COVID vaccine is already incredibly undervalued as is. Their NanoFlu vaccine has shown to be very effective in phase 3 clinical studies and has already been shown to be much more effective than the version Sanofi has developed.\n\nAs a plus, unlike other CEOs of this sector dumping all their stocks, the CEO has increased his number of shares since the beginning of COVID.\n\nImportant events:\n\nMay 11 2020: Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) awards NVAX $384 million to advance clinical development of their COVID vaccine NVX-CoV2373.\n\nJuly 7 2020: Trump awards NVAX $1.6 Billion\n\n7/27: Trump visits FujiFilm factory that will be manufacturing batches used in NVAX Phase 3 trial and awards FujiFilm a $265 million contract.\n\nPhase 1 clinical trials are expected after hours today, so this may be your last opportunity before this stock truly goes to Pluto.\n\nThings ik you autists will say:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s already ballooned why would I buy in now\u201d\n\nPeople were saying this when it hit 40. People were saying this when it hit 70. Then 90. Then 110. Then 140. Somehow people are still bearish on this after it hit $160 yesterday. Today will be the biggest news NVAX will have regarding COVID, buy in today while you can.\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t produced a single thing available on the market\u201d\n\nVery true, but this time is different. Right now, not only does it have the support of Donnie, it also has international support from CEPI as well as the direct funding from the likes of Bill Gates. The technology they have been working on for the past decade will directly be used in their vaccine.\n\n\nMy personal success:\n\nMost of my gains as you\u2019ll see are simply from holding the stock long term. I have also taken up theta gang strategies to sell very OTM options to degenerates as I have no need to take the risk of buy options at this level. At this point if I am forced to sell my shares, I will be happy to take my $4 million and run. \n\nI will admit, buying call options are incredibly profitable and decently easy to predict. For example, this was known to be a very big week for NVAX (even with earnings being pushed back) and it had been facing a resistance at $150 for the past three weeks. Even WSB autists can see that it would likely break $150 sometime this week, and in a pleasant surprise, it managed to do that today and hit a 52wk high in the process. \n\n\nTLDR; NVAX goes brrr. Stage 1 clinical trial data released after hours today will make NVAX go more brrrrr. Earnings coming out next week will make NVAX go even more brrrrrrrrr.",

        "selftext": "Yes I know what you're thinking Autist, as you sit on your gaming chair sipping your choccy milk. \"I've seen all these \ud83d\udc3b posts before and stonks kept going up, printer goes BRRRRRR\"\n\nFundamentals haven't mattered for months, and except for some sharp pullbacks, NQ and SPY have all been on an absolute tear being instabid on every dip.\n\nThat's all about the change.\n\nTldr - bond market/ PM pricing in no deal on stimulus.\n- Bifurcation of NQ and SPY reached major tipping points.\n- DXY likely to bounce back strongly on risk off sentiment and foreign central bank action.\n- macro long term positioning for Inflation playing out across asset class correlations ( RUSSELL and value stocks starting to gain traction )\n\n1.\nPriced In has become a retarded meme at this point but what does it actually mean? It means basically that the market, chiefly big \ud83d\udcb0 / institutions are expecting a future outcome ( or probability of one) and have allocated money appropriately. Historically Fixed Income due to its relative size has been a fairly reliable indicator. Previous crashes this year such as Feb/March crash and the mini NQ/SPY crash in June and July were both foreshadowed by major/ high Vol shifts downwards in 10 year bond prices .\n\nCurrently 10 year are plumbing new lows at the bottom end of 0.50 percent ( discounting the March flash crash ). This coupled with the meteoric rise in GLD and SLV last night IS NOT A GOOD SIGN. The sharp changes occured directly after stimulus news. \n\nWhat this means is that Institutions are signalling a chance the package will not be passed on time or in its entirety . \n\nBUT BUT VIX IS DOWN AND EQUITIES ARE UPPIES!\nyes little autismo, they are but that doesn't mean what you think it does. it's a poorly kept secret that this market is being kept afloat by hedge funds , institutional buying and retail fomo. I don't have the crayons or time to explain it to you but just look at news releases, support level buying and virus/ trade talks pumps. institutional players left the market in February , now it's just algos and retail. Vix being low doesn't necessarily mean what you think it does either. To oversimplify VIX goes up when more people buy puts. This is typically done hedge against market drops. \nBig players don't need to hedge if they SOLD all/ most of their equity holdings and moved it into Bonds/ Gold / Foreign equity. Hedge funds are also notorious for shorting VIX as part of the 'Fed Put \" trade . The fact that FI/PM are up while VIX is down makes me more certain of a drop not less as it means Big boys are trying to pass as many bags as they can to retail without spooking them.\n\n2. There's been a lot of articles on this already so I'll keep it short, you all know how to use Google. SPY since March lows has been split in two like a sociopathic Solomon. There is the big 5 tech and everything else. Currently Big 5 is sitting at 25 percent of all market cap with huge returns over the last few months. This coupled with the performance differential of the other 495 has surpassed levels not seen since the dot com boom. THIS IS NOT SIGN OF A HEALTHY BULL MARKET. Major Bifurcation is the second best signifier of a \ud83d\udc3b after the technical 20 percent drop level ( which doesn't really mean much) . \ud83c\udf4f Has now become the largest company in the world surpassing Saudi Aramco. THIS TECH BOOM IS NOT SUSTAINABLE. Most of the apple gains have been from a one of WFH structural shift and Fiscal stimulus ( that now accounts for 25 percent of all disposable income ). If the stimulus bill doesn't pass, Apple is fucked. Just look at the AAPL gains from the last week, do you think this is sustainable?\n\nThe common retort on this sub is, \" we all know it's a bubble but it will pop in few months, I'm getting my TENDIES while they're hot! \"\n\nThis sentiment has been thrown around for months all through April to July. Well what if months later is now? What better catalyst for a bubble pop than a Stimulus not going through as planned? \n\n3. There's been a lot of posts about DXY dying and a lot of it is half true. Currencies are a hard thing to predict but I do want to point out two very key factors that are bullish for DXY. \n3a- The entire world, especially emerging markets rely on Dollar inflows from exports to fund imports for key goods, especially commodities (oil etc). Global trade fell off a cliff in March and has barely recovered so where are countries getting dollars? By buying bonds . This was the reason behind the DXY spike to over 100 in March and the reason why the FX central bank swap program was instituted by JPOW. So unless you see global trade rebounding strongly in the very near term ( pigs will fly ) bonds will continue to be bid extremely strongly at auction, supporting DXY. \n\n3b) DXY as has been pointed out is primarily dropping due to Euro strength ( which makes up about 65 percent of the Index). When DXY is compared to the Bloomberg trade weighted dollar index you'll see it hasn't dropped far at all and this makes sense (see 3a above). The Euro bullish trend, along with AUD/USD,GBP/USD and JPY/USD is unlikely to continue much further. Foreign central banks and governments for that matter will not allow the dollar to crater. We've already seen rumblings from the EU and JPY on this front as exports are already in a tenuous position. The last thing foreign companies need is a strong currency to hamper export sales. So I wouldn't bet against the FED, but I sure as shit wouldn't be getting against the ECB.\n\nSummary: I don't see this stimulus playing out on time or in full. Big money is pricing in either a delay or being scaled back substantially to meet Republican demands. I won't go into the specifics of the political theatre because quite frankly it doesn't matter. PM/ BONDS are are all the signalling device you need.\n\nHow I see this playing out: The stimulus bill will pass on few weeks after a substantial Rug pull, similar to the 2008 TARP fiasco. I would strongly recommend either holding cash or going long DXY while this plays out. Either buy the dip on GLD/SLV with leaps or go long TLT at like 180c.\n\nPositions : short MNQ 3 units at 10530 and 1 ES at 3220. Yeah got in a little early, wasn't expecting the tech earnings blowout but have the margin to hold. \n\nLooking at GLD leaps for 06/21 300c when we get a pullback ( due to margin calls ).",

        "selftext": "A post was made [earlier this week](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/i38k65/fed_tlt_buys_tuesthurs_guarantee_a_50125_return/) recommending people buy the August 7th 170 Call options on TLT.  TLT is a long-term Treasury ETF by iShares.\n\nAs you can see, the post has been removed, but the comments remain.  I think this is a good learning experience.\n\nThe poster and several others advocated the purchase of these options at $1.25.  That means $125 per contract which would give effective control of 100 shares of TLT.  The claim was that it was \"guaranteed money\" because the Fed announced it was buying bonds.  The strategy was to buy at the beginning of the week and hold until expiration date or shortly before.  Let's see how this played out:\n\nAs you can see in the comments, people were showing price charts and drawing lines on them claiming they had made money etc.  It's easy to pull up a chart and draw patterns after-the-fact.  But what happened with the price?\n\nWell yesterday the price of these options was around $1.25-$1.29 per contract.  That is around the same as it had been earlier in the week, which is a break-even or a loss in terms of opportunity.  But that's not the scary part.  As of right now, the price is 5 cents.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/U85P3VS\n\nThe strategy in this was to buy 25 Call options.  That would run around $3,200 at the price the time the post was made.  Right now selling these contracts would get you $125, which means the trade is a -$3,075 loss or so.  Wiped out completely.\n\nI kept asking for people to post up screenshots of their order fills (the buy and sell tickets) to show us that they made profitable trades and weren't just drawing lines on a chart.  They refused.  Guys, be careful.  Lots of people recommend shoddy advice or they oversimplify how options trades work.\n\nDo your due diligence, ask for some screenshots to see if they have any skin in the game.  A lot of times these guys aren't even making the trades, they are just doing a look-back and claiming they were in on the position.  Things aren't so simple as \"The Fed is buying bonds, I'm going in heavy on call options!\"  It's more complicated.\n\nLet this be a cautionary tale.  I feel sorry for the guys who actually followed this position in and who are now looking at some large red numbers.  I get downvoted a lot for being \"condescending\" and a lot of other descriptors.  But I actually do care about investors losing money to half-baked ideas and my commentary hopefully steers people away from stuff like this.  Because innocent guys with a lower account value will take advice and run with it and take food off their own family's table unknowingly.  That's who I'm trying to help.",

        "selftext": "  \n\nI was introduced to options in 2005. \n\nA co-worker of mine, who happened to be a 9/11 Truther before that was a term, was all hyped up on the upcoming ER for Amgen. He went around the office on a manic high, telling everyone to buy short term OTM call options - or as we refer to them around these parts, FDs. \n\nAs part of our retirement plans, we each had Fidelity brokerage accounts. To enable options trading, however, you had to call Fidelity and answer questions about your level of financial smarts and how much money you had. The correct answers were, of course \"genius level\" and \"shitloads.\" I answered truthfully. My other coworkers did not. They got to options trading enabled. I did not.\n\nAmgen beat and some of these guys landed 8 baggers. My own officemate made $50k and promptly took his family to Disneyland. As you can imagine, I was dismayed that I missed out.\n\nFor the next few months, chasing the next big trade was all the rage, and our team could hardly get anything done. I got my account upgraded by answering the questions correctly, but every play the group made after Amgen was a loser. Because I never had that thrill of victory, I quickly lost interest, but the temptation to recapture those initial gains captivated some of the other guys. As the losses racked up, the trading group got smaller and smaller, eventually distilling down to the most degenerate off talking in the corner, the crazy Truther mumbling his false prophesies to his last few disciples. I lost about $1000 \u2013 which was no small change at that time in my life \u2013 but I know that some of the guys lost a lot more chasing that high.\n\nThat\u2019s still better than the snake oil the retail investment crowd is selling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor any market at any given time, Boggleheads and r/investing will tell you to just keep putting money in, no matter how badly you are getting fucked.\n\n*\u201c7% YoY in the market!\u201d* \n\n*\u201cThe greatest force in the universe is compound interest!\u201d*\n\n*\u201cIf you hold for the long term, you don\u2019t have to worry about volatility!\u201d*\n\nHere\u2019s the cold truth: the life advice Boomers give out is fucking outdated, designed for an analog world created by a Greatest Generation that coddled them, and that includes their financial advice as well.\n\nI am from the \u201c[Oregon Trail Generation](https://socialmediaweek.org/blog/2015/04/oregon-trail-generation/)\u201d, the last slice of GenX that actually grew up with computers. We are the cohort that witnessed the death of the American Middle Class that the Internet Age and Globalization, entering the workforce just as the dot-com bubble finally put it out of its misery.\n\nWhen I was 3, my grandfather retired from Boeing after 35 years. They gave him a platinum plated set of draftsman\u2019s tools, a brass desk clock and a lifelong pension.\n\nWhen I was 19, my girlfriend\u2019s dad was a consultant for Boeing. His job was to dig up dirt on upcoming retirees so they could be fired to deprive them of that pension.\n\nI did the *thing,* that good old American Dream \u2013 marriage, house, car, kids. I did what the \u201cexperts\u201d tell you to do: save a slice of each paycheck for retirement, invest in a college plan, buy a house as a solid investment. \n\nHere I am barely middle-aged, and I have worked through three major financial crises since I entered the workforce.\n\nI\u2019ve chased a runaway housing market, lowering my parameters every month because the prices kept rising faster than I could make for a down payment.\n\nTwice, I have had my retirement account fleeced, then had to draw down what was left to keep a roof over my head - paying a penalty to do so. \n\nI have been so upside down on a mortgage I\u2019ve considered burning the house down.\n\nSo I am here to tell you firsthand that *Save, Buy, Hold and Diversify* will not help you when the whole market collapses and you find yourself in need of that money, that a house is just an investment that you can live in while it drops in value, and that *Dollar Cost Averaging* is another way of saying *Getting Cucked.*\n\nI say, if you are going to make or lose 50% in the next 10 years, you may as well make or lose that 50% in the next 10 *hours.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn some ways, younger Millennials and Zoomers are better equipped to face these facts than us older folks. If you came of age during the GFC or later, you understand that the game is rigged. All that bailout money is moving around the market while you are struggling to make minimum wage in the Uber Eats gig economy. Unlike those of us who grew up in more stable times, you know in your bones the halcyon days - the ones you've only ever heard about - about are never coming back. \n\nNot for everybody, at any rate.\n\nSo enters RobinHood, and it drives the financial pundits absolutely berserk. Who are these fucking kids YOLOing on HTZ? Don\u2019t they know they are supposed to be investing that money into a passive index fund, or even better, one of those retirement-date funds with the massive expense ratios? It\u2019s fucking up the game for the rest of us! \n\nI have traded options on and off for years in the hopes of making a little pocket money. Fact is, when commissions were $8-$20 per trade (plus a fee per contract), there was no way a small-time retail investor could participate meaningfully. With free or no commissions, the calculus has changed, lowering the bar of entry for smaller investors who can enter and exit a position at any time with only the bid-ask spread the main concern.\n\nBoomers created a monster, and they have only themselves to blame.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike many of you, when March hit, I jumped in to puts and lost a bunch of money. This is because I was using an old way of thinking about options, the only one available to small-time retail traders just a few years ago: \u201cI hope that this security makes a huge break in a particular direction.\u201d \n\nAfter this loss and subsequent reflection, I determined that the money was there to be had, just that I was taking the wrong approach. I developed a new strategy, one that takes advantage of the simple fact that I can enter and exit a position without significant commission costs. I began to diversify my targets, and enter smaller positions on those targets, so that I didn\u2019t have everything riding on one or two plays. I developed exit strategies - and followed them! \u2013 so that I could take my wins or cut my losses quickly and move on to the next trade. \n\nAnd most importantly, I made it a point to withdraw my gains, if any, at the end of every week.\n\nSince April, I have executed no less than 20 trades per week if you count option expiry. In 15 weeks, I have doubled my account value. Not because of some one-off spectacular play or because I\u2019ve been a bull a bull market. In fact, I\u2019m a bear, but using a pretty neutral strategy. I doubled my money because I adapted to this new trading climate, found what works for me, and simply stuck to it.\n\nDo I think that makes me some some sort of fucking genius? Absolutely not. I\u2019ve made some smart, conservative plays that turned really goddamned sour. I\u2019ve made some truly retarded plays that turned out great. I\u2019ve had good weeks, bad weeks, and weeks that amounted to an incredibly stressful waste of time. I still make a bunch of mistakes - weekly, if not daily. \n\nI am still prepared \u2013 waiting, even \u2013 for my whole account to get wiped out due to a cacophony of bad plays. In the end, these are all gut decisions. Do I feel good about this? For each of them, only time reveals if I am right.\n\nBut if I have taken one thing away from what I have learned so far this year, it is this: *anybody can make rent money in the equities market now*. You do not have to have a massive account to overcome the burden of commissions, or have a huge investment in dividend stocks to realize a gains-based income. And thank God for that, because the job market is not going to save you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know the gain porn here is enough to make a man drool, and the loss porn is enough to make his balls retract into his stomach. Just understand those are always one-sided directional plays. It\u2019s all-in on a single ticker, a true YOLO, not unlike putting it on black at the roulette table. It\u2019s easy to get caught up looking at the massive gains and get stars in your eyes.\n\nBut forget the lambo and the gold-plated yacht for a moment and consider something more immediate, such as: \u201ccould I pay this month\u2019s phone bill with my gains?\u201d With the money you can pare off into a brokerage account, is it possible to avoid spending the the money you make doing whatever it is you do for someone else and make your phone service \u201cfree\u201d?\n\nFor example, if you have $1000 and you make a reasonably conservative play with an exit strategy of $100 gain and $100 loss (such as a deep OTM 45DTE bull credit spread on a decent stock that\u2019s been beaten up recently, with a hard exit 21DTE), the likelihood is very high. It is not guaranteed \u2013 you may end up down $100 from where you started. But what *is* guaranteed is that you will have to spend 8 hours flipping burgers or whatever at $12.50 an hour to make that $100 if you don't. (Yes, I know, *taxes \u2013* the point still stands).\n\nWhen you finally get to take that $100 out and pay the phone bill with it, it becomes very, very real. \n\nImagine getting to a point where your trading gains pay for the things you *need*, so you can spend the money you earn with your blood sweat and tears on the things you *want.*\n\nThis is what it means to have a \u201cS.M.A.R.T.\u201d goal \u2013 small, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-sensitive. When you conform your efforts to translate into something small yet meaningful to your life, it changes the perspective.\n\nBut even if you decide to take your bi-weekly retirement contribution and YOLO it on MU FDs, you\u2019ve got just as much of a chance of coming ahead with that as you do giving it to Mr. Market to hold for the next 20 years.\n\nBoomers will tell you \u201cmost day traders lose money!\u201d First, \u201cday trader\u201d is a specific term. But that aside, it is also true most businesses fail in the first year. In both cases, people get burned, give up and go back to what they know. They fail to plan, they fail to learn from experience, and they fail to persevere. \n\nThis is not an appeal to \u201cnot be average\u201d nor to keep \u201cchasing bad money with good\u201d - just to keep trying. Set your goals, manage your risk, hone your successes, and learn from your failures.\n\nAt no other time in history has it been possible for the average Joe to participate in the equities market with so little friction as commission-free mobile trading, and with so much leverage as weekly options. I know, because I\u2019m old enough to remember when stock quotes were in the weekly paper, and they were registered in one-eighths of a dollar.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL,DR; T**o Hell with the haters like Cramer and his ilk. Keep learning and growing and trying to rake in tendies. The lambo isn\u2019t the goal - *financial freedom* is. An Ally savings account and a shit job the boss is trying his damnedest to offshore ain\u2019t gonna get you there. We live in a Merchant Republic awash in wealth, and you have the right \u2013 the obligation, even - to participate. Go get your fucking slice.\n\nI love you retards.",

        "selftext": "Hello fellow degenerates. \n\n I know there has been 6 billion posts about silver, but none of them so far have addressed the unusually large number of open contracts for September. Most of them have just been money printer go BRRRR = inflation = silver go moon. So here's a fun little argument of why silver might enter the stratosphere faster than a hooker in light up sketchers during September. \n\nLike I said, the current open interest for silver September contracts is NUTTY\n\n[COMEX Silver Futures](https://preview.redd.it/772mapunqug51.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e0b944dbbc70766eb70b90692f105d7c1edc7dd)\n\nEach contract represents 5,000 ounces of silver. Now, most of the time only a small portion of these contracts stand for delivery, say 1 or 2% amounting to \\~4 to 9 million ounces of silver. Back in July, an astonishing 17,294 contacts stood for delivery amounting to 86,470,000 ounces of the devils metal. For those of you that can't count, just understand that is a lot. \n\n[Silver Contacts standing for Delivery](https://preview.redd.it/901urvyarug51.png?width=648&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a83e739ffcc3996b381f67177a89c91a3c012f45)\n\nIf something similar happens in September, we might be looking at a similar number or more of silver ounces being delivered. So the question is, how much do the banks have? Glad you asked young autist.\n\n[COMEX - Registered and Eligible Silver in ounces.](https://preview.redd.it/bsdee47rrug51.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb1cc36d27e3da9a3834549ba95b23a202050b07)\n\n As of today, there sits a total of roughly 335 million ounces of silver at the Comex across all the big boy banks. \\~128 million of that is registered for delivery, meaning can be used to cover short position and stand for delivery. The other \\~208 million sits eligible, meaning it meets the exchange requirements and COULD be moved over to registered if desired. Funny thing is, a lot of the banks have been moving their silver from eligible to registered in the past couple months, wonder why. For fun, here are the current standings for JPMorgan and The Bank of Nova Scotia.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k5f3ovl1sug51.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be44c4e4bf3c6f1359ce828efab40ef162c413e2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xu98xvv4sug51.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b624a4a89126f4f5ebb1019347b3969be10feea\n\nJPMorgan has \\~33.8 million ounces eligible, and \\~131 million registered, while the bank of nova scotia has \\~15 million registered, and 6.5 million eligible. Now what happens when a bank holds a net short position and the longs stand for delivery? Well, good things for the price of silver, bad things for the bank depending on how much they actually have in the comex. \n\nSo what does all this mean? This is probably going to play out either one of two ways: \n\n1. A large amount of contracts will stand for delivery such as in July. If its enough, maybe some of the big banks who have short positions might find themselves in hot water with their silver delivery amounts.  Basically, if enough longs stand for delivery, the amount of silver available to the market goes down = price goes up. \n\n2. Few of the contacts stand for delivery. This is the bear case, if this happens, you better hope your bet on silver being a hedge for inflation is right boys. \n\nTLDR; Huuuge open interest on September silver contracts. If enough stand for delivery you might be able to move out of your wifes boyfriends basement and afford health care. \n\nSLV 9/30 27C &amp; SLV 12/31 30C",

        "selftext": "We've seen lots of posts recently from \"new\" investors freaking out over recent dips in the market and deciding whether they should get in or out. This is just a quick little post (and reminder) that anyone buying stocks should remind themselves about the impact of taxes on the trades their making.\n\nLets take the most recent meme stocks example: FSLY and NET\n\nLets assume you bought FSLY and NET on July 1 because you felt bullish going into the July 4th weekend. You would have bought Net at $37 and FSLY at $86.50.\n\nNow lets assume that you were smart enough to get out at the peak, which was August 4 for both stocks. FSLY would have sold for $116 and Net for $42.50. That means a 34% gain on FSLY and 15% gain on NET.\n\nBut here's something you should ALWAYS think about: if you sell you need to subtract 34% for the tax man since that holding was less than 1 year and it is taxed as income. So your 34% gain on FSLY is actually a 22% gain, and your 15% gain on NET is actually a 10% gain.\n\nNow lets do the numbers:\n\nIf you held FSLY for 1 year (until July 1, 2021), you only needed to get it to a price of $105 (not $116) to make the same money. For NET you had to hit a price of $40.70 (not $42.50).\n\nKeep all this in perspective when you look to \"take profits\" or \"should I keep holding my stock\".\n\nAlso, this DOES NOT take into effect the reallocation of capital. If you only have $100 to play with, and you bought FSLY at $86.50, holding for 1 year could be opportunity cost on other potential plays. In that case, you probably fucked up in timing your entry and exist. If you only have $100 to play, then what were your objectives on a stock that is already up 400% in 3 months? Did you expect another 100% movement after earnings because you prayed to JPow for more stimulus?\n\nBe realistic and critical about each move. These \"the stock is down, what should I do?\" posts are getting old. Here's a better question that should be posted to this sub: \"The stock is down to X, which is Y times the revenue to market cap ratio. I've done this research to indicate that the company can grow at this rate, which doesn't align to analysts. What are other people's opinion of my research so that I can more accurately assess my own personal price target for this stock I own, or am planning to own\" &lt;/rant&gt;",

        "selftext": "Background: I work in the used car business (I am one of those nice, honest used car salesman) And I've been kinda too busy to fux with stonks lately because we have been having record month after record month. We are sitting on more cash than we have ever had in my business's history (not even including the PPE loan), we have had people coming in and getting caught up on payments/paying off their car completely at a rate I have never seen before, and all of my friends in the industry are seeing the same thing. If my car lot was being traded like a public company, my stock price would probably double after my Q2 earnings report. It is that drastic.\n\nThe people buying cars at a buy here pay here lot are usually lower class, paycheck to paycheck, government hand out type people. Our busiest time of year is always tax refund time, because people have money burning a hole in their pockets. Since corona virus has started, it has been like 4 straight months of non stop tax refund day.  After seeing on here that pretty much every stock with a ticker is demolishing their guidance, I started looking for companies that I knew were gonna be highly affected by the influx of unemployment and stimulus that haven't had earnings yet. I stumbled upon Rent a Center (RCII). Their clientele is the exact same as mine, and they have a very similar business model (inhouse financing, rent to own, etc)\n\nDD: I am not the technical genius that some of the people on this sub are (and don't believe that red and green lines drawn all over a historic chart can magically predict the future), so I drove to a few rent a centers and struck up conversations with employees and managers to see if the sentiment was the same. The gist of every conversation that I had was \"Yeah its been fucking insanity since the stimulus and unemployment started flowing.\" One manager said they had 370 customers making payments last year, and are at 600 this year. Right now, the stock is still trading slightly below pre corona levels, unlike PRPL and some of these other memey stocks that are wayyyy up.\n\nOther observations:\n\nLast quarter RCII reported .67 EPS beating consensus estimates by 9 cents a share and the stock price jumped from 18.50 to 23\n\nExecs of the company bought a decent chunk of shares in the beginning of July, not sure if they were bonuses or they know what we are thinking.\n\nAnd for the cherry on top: the options are stupid cheap right now. With the stock trading at 29$/share, a 31$ Call for Aug 20 is only 75 CENTS.\n\nEarnings report is Wednesday. Going all in boys. Started accumulating Friday. Got a little dry powder left if it dips for any reason before hand.\n\nEdit: u/swaggymedia made a good find, he posted in the more serious options gambling sub: \"Spotted some unusual option flow in Rent-A-Center in December 18 CALLs. Player purchased 1,500 CALLs at the $40 strike (33% OTM), stock currently $29.00. Bet size was about $85k and the player is expecting a huge jump in stock price by the end of the year. RCII reports earnings next week August 5th. The strike price was the highest strike price currently available on the option chain and the volume of that trade was about 33% of total open interest for every single option chain available for that stock.\"\n\nTL/DR: Aug 21 RCII $31 Calls and preheat the oven to 450F for some juicy crispy tendies",

        "selftext": "First off, this post is meant to help people so just hear me out. Constantly this sub is filled with people talking about how they are now \"bag holders\" bc a stock they invested in has gone down 10-15%. I read the comments and a lot of the time ya'll are only monetarily down like $50-$100, which in the grand scheme of things is nothing.\n\nFor example, I threw $1k into $IBIO when everyone said to \"buy the dip\" on Tuesday. When it continued to fall yesterday I was down about $150 and then I exited. Cut my loses and on to the next one. I'm able to forget about it and focus on my next win, instead of bag holding for another few weeks or months and having my money tied up. You shouldn't be afraid to bail out when you're down if the physical dollar amount isn't outrageous.\n\nI scan this sub religiously all day and people make great suggestions for daily swing plays. I'd say there's about 5-10 tickers I make a few $100 on every week by only holding them for a day. Granted I'm putting about $1k into these but the whole point of penny stocks is to get in and out. \n\n\"Planet Lambo\" is not a thing. If you invested $5k in Amazon in the late 90's it would be worth $750k today. Which is absolutely incredible don't get me wrong but please get the notion out of your head that you might be able to invest $200 in and get a return in the tens of thousands just bc it's a penny and has a low price.\n\nSimply put, get in and out fast, and don't be afraid to lose a bit. You have to spend money to make money. I never hold more than 3 days unless i truly believe in the company.\n\nI hope this helps some people!",

After seeing all the fellow autists here that listened to my DD and yolo'd their life savings on a tech/mattress company and are now disappointed that their tendies have dried up, I feel like I have an obligation to come clean and let you all know that it's entirely possible that I didn't actually have a vision from God himself.\n\nYou see, the night before the morning that I posted my DD earlier this week, I stayed up all night on a spree of ketamine, THC edibles, and psychedelic mushrooms binge watching sci-fi movies. By the next morning, I was in a bit of a manic haze. There is a chance that my vision from God actually might have simply been a delusion of grandeur spurred by the cocktail of psychedelics, dissociatives, sleep deprivation, and meme hype on PRPL.\n\nNow, I'm not saying that my DD is wrong necessarily, only that, upon reflection, my interpretation of my visions may not have been from God himself.

        "selftext": "Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google. These companies have one thing in common - their market cap is above $1 Trillion. They're all fairly diversified, some more some less but they certainly don't rely on one single product to exist. It's actually basically impossible to open a business nowadays without having to do with at least one of these companies. I realize that just 15 years ago the top 4 companies by market cap were very different ones and historically things have always changed, especially in tech. This time feels different though. Regulators are sleeping and politicians don't understand these companies. On top of that China is getting more and more powerful so it's questionable if there's even political interest in holding back the tech giants. Whenever competition emerges they can just kill it with money either by simply buying the competition or making the own product superior. On top of that their products have long lasting lock in effects. For the business side it's very expensive to move away from them and your average user hates having to get used to something new. As long as something \"just works\" people don't change for minor benefit and it feels like these companies have gotten strong enough to ensure that nobody else is ever offering something vastly superior.\n\nAs much as the past has shown otherwise, I don't see a world in which Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Google are not at all at least top 10 in market cap 20 years from now.\n\nAt this point why even bother with anything else and not go all in on them?",

        "selftext": "So I\u2019ve been riding AMD\u2019s cock since late June and have made some great returns, especially in the past two weeks. That being said, today I sold my remaining call contracts on the stock. No, not because I think AMD is going to drop (although it will have price pullback all the way down to $77)- but because I think there\u2019s an opportunity that many investors (including you autists and bag holders) are overlooking.\n\nINTC took a massive hit the last two weeks (-$13.42 between 07/20-07/31) , following a pump on AMD after their Q2 earnings beat, with the additional help of many news outlets covering the AMD versus INTC battle. In the midst of all of this, INTC decides to let everyone know that they will not be manufacturing chips anymore- which sealed the deal on AMD being a dominant force in the chip manufacturing industry. \n\nI see a lot of people, especially on this retarded reddit page full of blind option traders (with the exception of the 10% who know what they are doing) talk about how \u201cINTC is going to drop all the way down to $32\u201d... \n\n\n\n- Here is what you need to understand about Intel -\n\nSince 2014, Intel\u2019s revenue in the Client Computing Group (chip manufacturing) has dropped almost 7% in 6 years. You cannot let this news regarding Intel\u2019s switch in corporate direction give jurisdiction on whether you think the corporation will be of any value a year from now. It is obvious that Intel has been slowing the production of their chips for atleast two years now, and they have slowly been shifting in a different direction because of an increase in revenue provided from the data sector.\n\n\n\nSo what does this all mean?\n\nThe fact that Intel has cut the manufacturing of chips is actually a good thing for the corporation, whether you think so or not. It has been a slowly-decaying revenue stream for years, and the money can be implemented in other sectors in which Intel has seen yearly-growth in revenue.\n\nI know, it\u2019s hard. Intel isn\u2019t making chips, doesn\u2019t make sense right? Yea it kind of doesn\u2019t make sense. BUT, in a broader scheme of things, it does. They have been getting killed by their competitors for years, so the move seems appropriate.\n\n\n\nINTC STOCK\n\nThe only times INTC stock has dropped below $50, in the past 3 years, were for the following reasons:\n\nAugust to February 2018- Intel suffers scrutiny for announcing that they are shifting their focus away from chip making and towards A.I., memory solutions, cloud computing, and IoT.\n\nJuly to August 2019- News articles released regarding AMD\u2019s new Ryzen chips and their comparison to Intel.\n\nMarch 2020- Do i really need to explain this drop\n\n\n\nConsensus\n\nINTC has been hinting for YEARS that they are leaving the chip manufacturing sector and turning towards other profitable ones. Their latests announcement shouldn\u2019t be a surprise, but if you are someone who hasn\u2019t followed them for years- then it may seem like one.\n\n\n\nThe reason you are reading this\n\nINTC 60C - exp 01/15/21 \nThese \u201crelatively small\u201d leap contracts are sold for pennies on the fucking dollar right now. If you read what I just wrote, which I\u2019m sure most of you won\u2019t- then you would understand that this move has a lot potential. Right now, INTC isn\u2019t gonna drop any more. If it goes below $40, then maybe I\u2019m wrong.\n\nBut I\u2019m never wrong.\n\n\n\nAmd to the moon, but lets not be retarded on how we value a major corporation like this. I mean cmon. LOL",

        "selftext": "this post will probably get deleted and ill get banned from this sub so save this post if you wanna use it later to \"educate\" yourself. anyways ill teach how pumps and dumps work, how pumpers do things and all that in this post. my knowledge isnt from me, its from my friends who pumped 3 or 4 stocks, i watched from the sidelines as they did stuff and joined 1 of the pumps without actually doing work for them so i know jackshit, also, everyone does things differently, this is just the strategy my friends used, it worked for them.\n\n**This is important: if there's one thing you get from this post every single \"DD\" or \"TA\" or whatever the fuck happens here is a pump, sure you might make money from it, but if you do just run. just fucking run and never come back.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. being a pumper: being a pumper is easy, as long as you have money, 20k is usually enough, among my friends they had 50k, the more the better. also if youre gonna be a pumper NEVER do it alone, you can do it alone but its way more fun with friends and it also mitigates the risk cause it makes you a bigger \"whale\". you also need reddit accounts, like 20-30 is good, if youre doing it with 5 people its 4-6 accounts per person. then we get karma from making a private subreddit and upvoting each others posts, and wait for the accounts to get older, a month is fine but it doesnt matter most of the time. theres also accounts you can buy if you find making your own is a pain, theyre pretty cheap\n2. finding a ticker, finding a ticker is also easy, usually they used to just spam letters into yahoo finance stock  search until they ended up finding a ticker, criteria for the ticker: must be under 500k avg volume, on the day we find the ticker the volume must be nearing the average. another criteria is usually under $3, last criteria is theres more selling than buying on the day we find the ticker, yes this is bad, but not for us. i lied theres one more criteria thats really important: company pr must be active and or earnings must have happened a month ago or happening in 2 weeks. there also needs to be a dogshit excuse for a catalyst\n3. after finding the ticker we wait for a regular day where the volume seems to be heading above average or slightly above average. then we buy in slowly, usually 2-4 thousand dollars at a time until our moneys in the stock.\n4. we write the \"dd\" or the post thats overly confident, i like to think 50% of upvoters enter the plays here with 100-500 dollars average, good \"dd\" can get between 100-500 upvotes, so you get an extra $10,000-$250,000 in a stock, this makes the volume unusual and triggers algorithms or people with more money (and/or intelligence) pick it up on a screener or something, adding more money to the pump. Then more and more players come in, while this happens the stock rises and then there comes the sell off.\n5. when we sell, instead of selling a few thousand shares at a time we sell the stocks all at once at a certain ask. this sets up a \"wall\" so people think after it breaks itll continue to rocket. sometimes it does, sometimes it doesnt, we don't care, we made money. but on high volume days like with happened to gnus and xspa a while back the wall will get eaten for sure, if your stock pick ends up doing something like gnus then just dont even bother watching it.\n6. our shares are gone we get out with profit and leave.\n\n**smaller pumps:**\n\nsmaller pumps happen too, sometimes the stock goes up 10% other times 40% which is actually quite big. but when you see people writing dd they're probably taking profit at 10-20%. to you this may not seem like a lot but keep in mind most banks struggle to get their clients 10% profit a year, when youre getting 10% off one trade it's pretty good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthats all im gonna write. this is way more complicated then what i went through on the post, if youre gonna be a pumper theres way more to learn. i dont even know what im saying, if you want to know stuff dm the dd writers and ask them maybe they'll tell you, but theyll probably spit out some bullshit like \"i love to help the community by writing dd hehe\". also theres different kinds of pumps, for example there was gnus and xspa where literally every \"DD\" writer was saying buy it and the volume was just absolutely massive, and theres like 500% gains in a week. then there's regular size pumps, the things youd see from that guy prado and some other guy i think his name was i skippedfaceday im not sure. these get lucky people 30-40%, but the dd writers are most likely happy with 10-20%, or maybe they ride it with everyone else i have no clue. theres also failed pumps which fucking suck for everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nkey takeaways/tldr\n\neverything you see is a pump and dump\n\ndd writers will usually be happy with 10-20% gain, and sometimes this is when they will dump a stock\n\nif youre being a pumper and make a wrong call just turn around and say something like \"GUh whYD You BUy i SaiD dO yOUr OwN Dd hUHuhuHUhuh and usually your \"reputation\" as a \"dd writer\" will be fine\n\ndont take this post seriously, i know NOTHING at all, like absolutely nothing, if you want knowledge about how pumps work ask the famous dd writers. 90% chance theyll act like theyre not pumping but they are. but seriously, this post is illiterate and foolish, you can become a pumper but you wont learn like this. but by now if this post gets big then everyone will think theyre a professional pumper like that faggot stan and bates or whatever the fuck his name was\n\n**important: this post doesnt make you special or smarter, dont act like youre suddenly educated now, pumps will continue to happen, they will always continue to happen and you can't stop them. you wont even know youre falling for one. you know how they say 90% of traders lose money, yeah well 99.99% of pumpers fail.**\n\nmad respect to the dd writers though theyre smart\n\nim never logging on to this account again bye",

        "selftext": "In a recent post I did on AMD, some had expressed interest in a write-up on Cloudflare. I wasn\u2019t going to write anything since I am long NET, but then I saw Fastly up around 13% today ahead of its earnings on Wednesday. With both Cloudflare and Fastly reporting this week, I thought the timing was apt to compare these two as they\u2019ve pursued different approaches to building their networks. And I happen to believe that while Fastly\u2019s heavy focus on speed/performance does offer some advantages in the CDN market, the real opportunity in these names (as well as Akamai for that matter) is the edge computing market \u2013 not CDN.\n\nI think one of the major reasons why Fastly is up over 430% YTD and Cloudflare over 145% is because most analysts were slow to pick up on the full extent of the end market(s) these companies are exposed to. I also think there has been some conflation in terms of the technology. Even now, I see CDN and edge computing used interchangeably when they are not necessarily the same. While similar ideas in that they both leverage edge servers (servers placed at a closer geographical proximity to the end-user or device), the use-case is not necessarily the same. Think of a CDN more so as a particular application or use of edge computing. To this point, multiple CDN players (Akamai, LimeLight, CDNetworks) have made recent moves into the broader edge computing market. \n\nBroader is the keyword here, because whereas CDNs cache web content (videos, photos, etc. from a website to speed its \u201cdelivery\u201d to the site\u2019s visitor), the hype surrounding edge computing is more so tied to 5G and the Internet-of-Things rather than primarily websites or SaaS applications necessarily. To be more specific, the value proposition of IoT is the vast distribution of sensors and real-time *collection* of data. Positioning edge networks closer to the IoT devices can enable faster industrial or logistics solutions.\n\nThose familiar with Fastly will be aware that they offer (or offered) the fastest cold start times (this just means the time it takes for an application to start up and be responsive to user input) of any serverless network application (CDN or edge) at 35 microseconds. Fastly claims that they are the gold standard for speed and performance and superior to AWS, Azure, Google, and Cloudflare. This approach has been successful, especially in targeting large enterprise customers. Fastly has a much larger average customer size relative to Cloudflare. \n\nWhile Fastly has recently expanded their security offerings as they further develop their edge platform, Cloudflare's strategy from the onset has been to balance performance, speed, and flexibility. Why does this matter? The major drawback to edge computing is that it greatly increases attack vectors for network intrusion. 5G will enable an extremely rapid proliferation of IoT devices. According to the Telecommunications Industry Association, by 2022, more than half of all internet-connected devices will by IoT machines. And IoT device operators will absolutely prioritize security of their industrial and logistics applications, especially as most computing applications (websites, programs, etc.), are not really as sensitive to latency at the speeds we are talking \u2013 i.e. the user/operator can\u2019t actually discern the speed difference on their end. \n\nIoT operators (industrial, logistics, transportation companies) won\u2019t be focused on consumers doing e-commerce or going on Reddit. They will be collecting zettabytes of structured and unstructured data to *push upstream* so that they can manage their assets more efficiently and securely. Fastly\u2019s network utilizes fewer servers to increase efficiency and speed. Although that is great for Twitter, this lowers the network capacity to mitigate DDoS attacks (the most common IoT attack). Cloudflare has more points-of-presence and network capacity versus Fastly. This combined with their more expansive attack logs (Cloudflare services a far greater number of web properties than Fastly) and more mature security product portfolio, gives their network architecture numerous advantages for the edge computing market. This is all ignoring the fact that Cloudflare announced last week *zero nanosecond* cold start times for its edge computing platform which totally undercuts the Fastly speed advantage anyway. \n\nThe CDN market is larger today. Prior to COVID and the work-from-home demand boost, estimates tagged it at around $13.3bn. In comparison, the edge computing market was only $3.5bn in 2019 according to Grand View Research. Looking towards the future though? The CDN market is forecasted to hit $23bn plus by 2025, while the edge computing market is seen hitting $43bn or more in 2027. There have been recent reports that suggest the rise in the edge computing market over the next 10 years could even rival the growth in public cloud over the previous ten years (led by Amazon, Microsoft, Google). And Gartner believes that by 2025, three-quarters of enterprise-generated data will be created and processed at the edge. If you stop and think how much data has been created in 2020 versus just a few years ago, that is truly staggering growth. \n\nThe above comments gloss over the fact that there are also some very real reasons why a CTO or purchaser would select Cloudflare as a CDN over Fastly. The other big advantage Fastly has over Cloudflare (and Akamai) is it is *much* more customizable for developers. For web applications that are very high-level enterprise grade or extremely sensitive to latency, it absolutely makes sense to go with Fastly. However not all use-cases for a CDN require that level of customization, and there is quite the vertical learning curve for developers to learn the Fastly platform. Cloudflare also has more flexible pricing tiers (including a free tier) for customers who may not need the premium features. In short, there is a much wider range of use-cases that Cloudflare can cater to with its CDN platform relative to Fastly. I think this is evidenced by the fact that Cloudflare has far more customers (number not size) in addition to a much bigger developer community on Stackflow. \n\nThis all gives Cloudflare more potential to scale with its CDN customers and cross-sell its more diverse product portfolio. Again, Fastly certainly has a very strong presence in the large enterprise market. And for many, the performance and customization offered by Fastly will be a decisive factor when it comes to which CDN provider to choose. But I do think that Fastly has very much built itself to be the premium provider when a lot of customers are totally happy with a marginally slower cold start time if it means more flexibility on cost or ease-of-use.\n\nAt the end of the day, what this boils down to is which end market are you more bullish on: CDN or edge computing. For the record, I think over the next five years Fastly has a great opportunity to keep up the momentum. Its performance YTD would scare me a little bit in the immediate term because I think these levels assume continued growth acceleration or more guidance raises. But the CDN market is projected to keep growing at a healthy clip. And like I said, there are definitely some clear use cases for Fastly. \n\nI just happen to think that Cloudflare has a much, much, much higher long-term ceiling (thinking next 10-15 years) when you look at its natural advantages in the edge computing space and the enormous potential of that end market. Also of note, Cloudflare is slated to nearly double its global data center footprint over the next 3 years through its joint venture in China with JD.com. And whatever you think of China, its undeniable that there will be a data explosion there as internet penetration goes from the low 60% it is today to someday rival western countries. \n\nFastly is interesting, but when you look at the fact that Cloudflare has 77% gross margins compared to 57% for Fastly, you are ultimately paying a higher EV/revenue for slower growth, fewer revenues, one-fifth the cash, and significantly weaker margins. Good luck to all!",

        "selftext": "**Possibilities of the Election-**\n\n As we know uncertainty is extremely high in election season, and in this election anything can happen. There are a couple of things that can happen in the election- Joe Biden wins \"fair and square\" and trump concedes, Donald Trump wins \"fair and square\", and Biden then concedes. Both of these would be ideal conditions for the stock market and there would be no significant movements.\n\n However some other things can happen, in a war-game simulation by John Podesta he postulated that if Joe Biden wins the popular vote and Donald Trump won the electoral college but something \"fishy\" seemed to occur such as voter suppression, voter fraud or mail in voting scams then Biden could not concede and instead convince the democratic delegates/governors to inaugurate Biden in the house as president. This would then lead the military to be involved to decide the next course of action. The source is listed below.\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/02/business/media/election-coverage.html?smid=tw-share](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/02/business/media/election-coverage.html?smid=tw-share)\n\nThe exact opposite of the scenario could happen also, Biden could win and Donald Trump could claim voter suppression. I do not know if it would go as far as the details listed above but something similar could occur. \n\n**How To Prepare-**\n\nRight now the vix index is at \\~22 while gold and silver are in a bull market that I predict is just the start. This is an indicator that Gold and Silver price is increasing due to the price being relativity high historically speaking with low volatility which makes me to believe it is just the start. In preparation I have a diversified options on gold and silver stocks. Also leading up to the election it may be smart to buy some puts on the market as a whole and put it on SPY as the confusion will cause massive sells. \n\nLet me know your thoughts",

        "selftext": "I am in my twenties and like many \"new\" investors became very interested in the market as a result of the economic downturn brought on by COVID-19. I saw a lot of my peers on Twitter and FaceBook making decent gains and it really piqued my interest because I have been saving roughly 4k per month in a high interest savings account and not really doing much else with it. I always thought the market to be too risky for my taste but after becoming comfortable with my base savings, I was ready to start my own journey into investing. I am not really the kind of person to go off of word of mouth so I set out to learn as much as I could on my own through reading and online courses. I took a course on the basics of the stock market on Udemy which mainly covered fundamental analysis but touched on the technical side of things as well. In addition to this I took a more in depth course on just technical analysis which covered trend lines, candlestick patterns etc ... I didn't find it too helpful for long term investments but it still seemed interesting. Lastly I read the Intelligent Investor as well as One Up on WallStreet and a book on basic accounting to help me understand how to decipher what I was seeing on these annual reports and what all of the numbers meant when I was attempting to valuate a potential purchase .... as well as various YouTube courses and tutorials\n\nAll of this has occurred over the course of the past 3 months, so while I have become a little more knowledgeable than most of my friends just blindly throwing money into the market, I still don't feel very confident in my newly developed skills because .... well, they are new and I haven't had enough experience. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT ME AND MY JOURNEY INTO THE STOCK MARKET, SKIP TO HERE:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith that being said, I have been seeing a lot of talk about this 4:1 Apple split that is coming up and while I understand that this doesn't change the company fundamentally at all, I really can't seem to see why Apple is trading for what it is ... or more importantly, why so many analysts are rating it as a \"buy\". I know that Graham specifically warns against needing validation from \"professionals\" for your decision making but since I am still really a newbie, I wanted to know if there is something I am missing in forming my opinion that the stock is severely overvalued. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is how I arrived at this conclusion: \n\n**Point 1:** \n\nIn my opinion, Apple is nothing more than a 1 dimensional hardware company. When you look at the annual report for FY 19' the revenue stemmed from the following: \n\n* iPhone Sales: 54.7%\n* Services: 17.8%\n* Mac: 9.9%\n* Wearables, Home, &amp; Accessories: 9.4%\n* iPad: 8.2%\n\nOut of all of these things, the only one that is not hardware is services which means that 82.2% of the sales come from hardware alone ... mainly iPhone. \n\nFurthermore, if you look at what exactly makes up this \"services\" category you will see that it is Apple Music, Apple Care, iCloud, App Store Subscriptions, and also baked in there is the free version of iCloud, Maps, and Siri. \n\nNow, while I respect apple for growing this particular vertical (services) of its company which has experienced some good growth over the last few years\n\n2017: $32,700M in sales\n\n2018: $39,748M in sales (increase of 21.55%)\n\n2019: $46,291M in sales (increase of 16.46%)\n\nI can't help but also realize how closely coupled the services vertical is to the hardware vertical. Mostly all of the services Apple provides depend on the successful sale of its hardware. I can speak personally that I cancelled Apple Music in 2017 for Spotify because I switched jobs (software engineer) to a position that required me to work in a secure environment where I couldn't bring in my phone and since Apple Music had no web app, I couldn't listen to music and code while at work. This makes me weary of their services business as a whole because if for some reason the hardware becomes less popular then the services will suffer severely it seems ... you don't really need Apple Music without an iPhone .... and you aren't really paying for app store subscriptions if you don't have an iPhone or Mac ... and you also don't need Apple Care without an Apple Device, see where I am heading? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\niPhone sales are plateauing which can be seen by the data leading up to 2018 as well as the official announcement from Apple that they would stop providing exact numbers on the numbers of units sold at the end of 2018.  Data: [https://www.statista.com/statistics/276306/global-apple-iphone-sales-since-fiscal-year-2007/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/276306/global-apple-iphone-sales-since-fiscal-year-2007/)\n\nIn addition to iPhone sales slowing up ... PC sales have been declining across the board for a while due to the fact that handhelds have become increasingly more powerful, this has also resulted in the plateauing of Mac sales as well. Data: [https://www.statista.com/statistics/276308/global-apple-mac-sales-since-fiscal-year-2002/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/276308/global-apple-mac-sales-since-fiscal-year-2002/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI say all of this to point out that for a company that is getting 82% of its sales from hardware, the hardware growth seems to be slowing down tremendously and the services market that it seems to be  shifting into seems largely dependent on the hardware, which seems concerning to say the least. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Point 2:** \n\nApple does not appear to either be a growth stock or a value stock in the current climate. Don't get me wrong, I think Apple is pretty good company as a whole and they appear to clearly be financially stable  even despite the declining hardware sales ... but at this price they are far from a \"value\" stock and from a financial perspective, they don't seem to be a \"growth\" stock either. \n\nWhen you look at net income for the past 5 years you will notice that it hasn't really changed too much, when comparing the most recent annual report with the one from 5 years ago the net income has only increased by 3.5% which doesn't even take into account inflation which in actuality would make it seem like the net income for FY 19' was actually less than what was earned in FY 15'\n\n2015: $53.39B\n\n2016: $45.69B\n\n2017: $48.35B\n\n2018: $59.53B\n\n2019:  $55.26B\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFurthermore, what seems funky to me is that the EPS actually seems to be increasing over time ... but it is not due to the net income rising, it is due to the fact that Apple has been buying back stock each year thus decreasing the total number of shares outstanding from 5.75B in 2015 to 4.62B in 2019, a decrease of 19.65% over the past 5 years ... this makes the EPS seem higher and the P/E seem lower, making the stock seem more valuable than it actually is. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SHARES OUTSTANDING:** \n\n2015: 5.75B\n\n2016: 5.47B (-4.87%)\n\n2017: 5.22B (-4.57%)\n\n2018: 4.96B (-4.98%)\n\n2019: 4.62B (-6.85%)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2015 - 2019 Change: - 19.65%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EPS (as is in annual report):**\n\n2015: $9.28\n\n2016: $8.35 (-10.02%)\n\n2017: $9.27 (+11.02%)\n\n2018: $12.01 (+29.56%)\n\n2019:  $11.97 (-0.37%)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2015 - 2019 Change: +28.99%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EPS (based on consistent shares outstanding of 5.75B across all years)**\n\n2015: $9.28\n\n2016: $7.94 (-14.44%)\n\n2017: $8.40 (+5.79%)\n\n2018: $10.35 (+23.21%)\n\n2019:  $9.61 (-7.15%)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2015 - 2019 Change: +3.56%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen if we use each 2019 EPS to calculate the P/E based on todays closing price of $452.04\n\n**P/E TTM as is:** $37.76\n\n**P/E TTM adjusted based on consistent shares outstanding:** $47.04\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot really sure if I am even allowed to make an adjusted calculation based on what if they never brought back the shares but nonetheless here it is .... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Point 3:**\n\nThis is purely speculation which is against the rules, I know .... but I can't help but think consumer psychology has to play a role in the market.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that consumers don't really know what they want until it is presented to them, iPhone has dominated the market for what seems like forever but in actuality, it has really only been about a decade. iPhone 4 was the real game changer since it allowed people to get their hands on an iPhone for other carriers. There seems to be a general consensus among many consumers now though that all Apple does is slap a new camera on each new model, repackage it, and put it on the shelf .... being in tech myself, I understand that the technical upgrades such as chipsets and other components that don't bring forth clear, tangible improvements do play a vital role in allowing the device to move forward and become more capable but I don't think the average consumer understands that. \n\nApple vs Android is a tired and pretty much done battle, they have been battling for the market for a while and many consumers have chosen their side and will likely stick with it at this point when comparing the 2 ... however, I have a feeling that if a new product were to emerge onto the market that were neither android or apple but introduced something reliable, new, and fresh then consumers would be more than ready for a change. Apple's double edged sword is that it is a complete ecosystem, all of the devices rely on some type of proprietary operating system which when paired together create a pretty good user experience between the devices. However, make no mistake, iPhone sits at the top of that ecosystem and for many consumers, iPhone is the segway into the Apple ecosystem. You get an iPhone and you like it .... so now when you get a computer you want a Mac etc. I say this to point out how financially dependent Apple is on the iPhone, if ever it should fail ... then the performance of the company will suffer miserably. How long can iPhone continue to dominate? Touch screen phones of this type have been running the scene for the past decade, I honestly think a major change is on the horizon for smart phones, but I don't necessarily believe Apple will be the company to usher it in .... and because of that belief I just don't think it would be a good idea to overpay for a stock now with the stupid belief that the what goes up must continue to go up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion:** \n\nFrom everything I see it seems like Apple is severely overvalued right now, the company  has shown a long history of growth and one would like to think that would continue but based on the financials it doesn't seem like the growth factor is really there right now. I don't think the company is doomed or is a bad pick, I just don't think it's a good pick at its current price. However, with that being said ... I don't have nearly as much experience as many of you I'm sure and definitely not those analysts. on Wall Street, so I was trying to figure out why people are so excited as the price sits now and why the buy rating seems to be so high.",

        "selftext": "## What\u2019s A Stock Split And How It Could Affect Your Current Holdings\n\nApple and Tesla, arguably two of the hottest companies on [Wall Street](http://www.stockmarket.com/investing), both announced stock splits in recent weeks. The question is, can it positively affect your current holdings? First, let\u2019s understand what a stock split is. Essentially, a stock split is exactly what it sounds like. One share is splitting up into a few individual shares. This often comes after a particular share price has been inflated to a level that may be \u2018too high\u2019. For example, in Tesla 5-for-1 stock split example, one share worth $1500 now will be broken into 5 shares worth $300 each. This way, it will lower the entry barrier for investors who wish to buy a stake in the company.\n\nA stock split can typically result in a share price increase following a decrease immediately after the split. Since many retail investors find the stock now more affordable, they end up boosting demand and driving up prices. A stock split also reminds investors that the share price had been increasing in the past. It is not surprising that many investors extrapolate the historical growth into the future and bid up the share price again. One thing to also note is that even though the number of outstanding shares increases and stock price decreases, the market capitalization doesn\u2019t change.\n\n# Who Tend To Benefit From Stock Splits?\n\nGenerally speaking, stock splits are neutral events for current shareholders. In the case of the Apple 4-for-1 stock split, you used to own 1 stock, but moving forward you will own 4, but the total value remains the same. Essentially, a stock split wouldn\u2019t change the company value, all else being equal. But the truth is, all else is rarely equal when we apply it in the market.\n\nBoth TSLA stock and AAPL stock jumped after the announcement. This may be the fifth time for Apple to do a stock split, but it is Tesla\u2019s first. The price change will be more dramatic for Tesla, whose stock split will bring individual share to the $300 range. Compared to Apple\u2019s post-split of $100 range, Tesla\u2019s post-split stock might find it harder to attract smaller investors.\n\nCertain online brokerages offer investors to buy fractional stocks. Conceptually, it offers the same thing in the absence of stock splits. Then again, not all brokerages will offer such services and it\u2019s not that easy to move shares between brokerages. Therefore, it will not create a much stronger demand than actual stock splits. Now, like it or not, news of stock splits tend to cause share prices to jump. And that is not really rational. But who cares? As long as the prices go up, existing shareholders would not be complaining.\n\n## Tesla &amp; Apple\u2019s Stock Splits Could Restart The Trend Again.\n\nIs stock splits a thing in the past? Tracing back the history, in 1997, 102 companies in the [S&amp;P 500](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=SPY) split their stocks, and in 2016, only 7 companies did so, a decline of more than 90%. That is about to change when two of the hottest tech companies announced they will be splitting their shares at the end of this month. The zero brokerage fees environment gives companies a greater incentive to split shares today. In addition, it creates a more affordable and accessible stock for Robinhood traders to start trading. After all, many retail investors are nonetheless still prone to judging how \u201cexpensive\u201d a stock is based on its dollar value. That said, it is not surprising to see other tech companies like Amazon, Shopify, or Alphabet make such moves in their own timeline.",

        "selftext": "I can't get over the fact that they stole the Nikola name to start a new company with EV vehicles. Literally, Tesla and Trevor Milton names his company Nikola are you fucking kidding me?!\n\nCheck this article out - [https://observer.com/2020/06/tesla-elon-musk-mocks-nikola-hydrogen-fuel-cell-electric-vehicle/](https://observer.com/2020/06/tesla-elon-musk-mocks-nikola-hydrogen-fuel-cell-electric-vehicle/)\n\nElon says \u201cIt\u2019s just very difficult to make hydrogen, store it, and use it in a car. Hydrogen is an energy storage mechanism. It\u2019s not a *source*\u201d Musk said in a 2015 interview. \n\n\u201cElectrolysis is an extremely inefficient energy process,\u201d he went on to explain. \u201cIf you charge your battery packs from a solar panel directly, compared with trying to split water, take the hydrogen, dump the oxygen, compress the hydrogen with extremely high pressure or liquify it, put it in a car, and run a fuel cell. It is about half the efficiency. It\u2019s terrible.\u201d\n\nThen the ABSOLUTE CLOWN Milton retorts \u201cI think most technologies take 10 years or more to *productionize*,\u201d he [told Observer](https://observer.com/2019/11/elon-musk-tesla-electric-vehicle-rival-nikola-hydrogen-truck/) in an interview last year. \u201cWhile electric is now more mainstream, there are still issues to be worked out.

        "selftext": "Alright guys so I'm one of the hosts on a YouTube channel named \"Max Tech\".  \nI previously did YouTube work for the channel \"Appleinsider\" since 2016, making videos on Apple products which include Mac computers with Intel chips. \n\nI also grew up playing video games and building custom PCs right when AMD started to release six-core and 8-core processors that were cheaper than Intel CPUs and targeted towards gamers.  \n\nEven though the Intel chips were better for gaming, I still bought AMD because they were cheaper. Intel maintained the lead for many years since games really only used 4 cores, and Intel chips gave more consistent frame rates for gaming.\n\nAt one point, it was clear to me and to everyone else that Intel was intentionally holding off from innovating and improving their performance because they already owned a bulk of the market share. They realized that they could make more profit by making small improvements every year, while AMD was busting their ass trying to figure out how they can compete. (it was ultimately the gaming and custom PC market) \n\nMeanwhile.. Apple was using Intel chips quite successfully in their Mac computers the like MacBooks and iMacs. And Apple was also using their XEON chips for their higher-end machines. And of course, Intel was killing it in the server market.\n\nNow in 2013, Intel announced that they were working on their new 10nm chip process and that it should be ready to launch in 2015, and they said their 7nm chips should launch in 2017. \n\nBack to Intel, over the new few years, Intel delayed 10nm to 2016... and then to 2017.. and then to late 2019... We are now in 2020 and Intel is still shipping 14+++++ nm chips for high-end machines like the 2020 5K Apple iMac that was just released yesterday. Only laptops are getting the actual 10nm chips right now. \n\nIn 2017, AMD shocked the world by announcing their new Ryzen chips, and then also their Threadripper chips, and ever since then, they've been quickly catching up to Intel in terms of both performance and price. \n\nBecause of this, Intel instantly started lowering the price of their chips, and in 2018, they finally made 6-core chips for the MacBook Pro. 8-core chips in 2019, and now 10-core chips in 2020. This is an obvious and desperate move to try and compete with AMD. \n\nBecause Intel's 10nm chips were not ready in 2015 or 2016, Apple's redesigned 2016 MacBook Pro which was thinner than ever before, had overheating issues. The overheating was severe in 2018 with the 6-core chips that Intel made in fear of AMD. \n\nThere were even leaked emails from Intel executives worried about AMD's price to performance beating out Intel. \n\nAnd right now, it is well known that AMD is making BETTER price-to-performance x86 chips. \n\nThe MOST important part of this discussion is that the tech community as a whole, including or YouTube and Reddit, are now convinced that AMD is the way to go. I've seen countless comments on my videos that are dissing on Intel chips and wishing that Apple would switch to using Intel. \n\nIf we make a build guide video using an Intel processor, we get shamed and called dumb for not using an AMD chip. Our Mac Pro videos got a ton of negative feedback because Apple is stupid for using Intel chips. Our 2020 MacBook Pro videos were getting comments dissing on Intel's 10th-gen chips. The entire community is starting to hate Intel and preferring AMD.  \n\nAMD stock has increased over 11x since they announced the first Ryzen chips in August of 2016.  \nIntel stock has only increased 38% since that same date. \n\nAnd looking towards the future.. Intel has recently delayed their 7nm chips until late 2022 or 2023. This caused their stock price to tank at they last earnings call. \n\nThere's even now a class-action lawsuit against Intel because of this delay. \n\nThis also caused their chief of chip engineering to resign, and they reorganized their entire chip team. \n\nThey've even discussed outsourcing their future 6nm, 5nm and 3nm chip production to their rival foundry TSMC because they've lost confidence in their own foundry. \n\nSo it's clear that Intel is getting killed by AMD with each passing year, and the tech community knows it. (Which is VERY important)   \n\n\nThis brings us into the Apple and TSMC portion of this DD.   \n\n\nBack in 2013, Apple announced their A7 chip for their iPhone 5s, the first 64 bit smartphone chip, and ever since then, there was a massive performance war between Apple and Qualcomm, fighting to create the fastest smartphone chips, in which Apple ultimately won. \n\n(The A13 in the iPhone 11 Pro is still much faster than the Snapdragon 865+ which was just recently released this year) \n\nStuck in the middle of this battle was TSMC, which has been the EXCLUSIVE manufacturer of Apple Silicon chips for their iPhones and iPads since the A10 chip in 2016. \n\nAnd in 2018, Apple released their 11\" iPad Pro with the A12X chip manufactured by TSMC's 7nm process. This iPad from 2 years ago is so powerful that it still outperforms the new 2020 13\" MacBook Pro with Intel's 10th gen chip in both processor AND graphics performance. \n\nNow, Apple is about to announce their iPhone 12 in about a month that's gonna pack the A14 chip which is being built on TSMC's brand new 5nm process. \n\nAnd of course, the next iPad Pro will get a much improved A14X 5nm chip, and it's the same story for the Apple Silicon Mac chips that will start being released later this year in October/November. \n\nI'm of course, talking about Apple finally ditching Intel and moving forward with their own chips. This makes sense for Apple for various different reasons.\n\n1: They can run iPhone &amp; iPad apps on their Macs.\n\n2: They control both the software and hardware for incredibly amounts of performance optimization.\n\n3: They can make sure every new Mac update gets a new chip with performance improvements instead of relying on Intel to release improved chips. \n\n4: This is of course, much cheaper for Apple since they don't have to pay Intel the high price of their chips. \n\n5: They don't have to deal with overheating issues since most Intel chips are still on 14nm technology, therefore running very hot and using a lot of power.   \n\n\nAnd there's a good chance that the very first Apple Silicon Mac chips are gonna outperform the current Intel chips, stay much cooler and give you much better battery life. \n\nJust to give you some perspective in terms of how Intel's 10nm compares to TSMC's 5nm..\n\nIntel 10nm transistor density: around 100 million transistors per square millimeter.\n\nTSMC 5nm transistor density: around 171 million transistors per square millimeter. \n\n  \nTSMC has already confirmed that they're working on risk production of their new 3nm process in 2021,  with those chips going into 2022 iPhones, iPads and Macs. \n\nSo here's what the future looks like:\n\n  \nIntel 7nm in late 2022/2023 : 240 million transistors per square millimeter\n\nTSMC 3nm shipping in 2022 Apple products: 290 million transistors per square millimeter\n\nAnd apparently, TSMC is already working on plans for their 2nm process for 2024.   \n\n\nAnd due to Intel's past, there's a very good chance that Intel could delay 7nm even further, especially since they had to restructure their entire chip team, while TSMC has been on point.   \n\n\nSo the future isn't looking very bright for Intel's chip technology compared to TSMC. No wonder why they wanted to outsource their chips from them.   \n\n\nAnd one last bit on Apple's switch to their own chips built by TSMC. \n\nApple has already given developers their transition kit which is a Mac Mini with an A12Z chip from their iPad Pro. \n\nOne developer tweeted this: \"At this point, I think that the first gen Apple Silicon machines will be faster at running x86 code than an actual x86...\"  \n\n\nWhat he means is that Apple's new Rosetta 2 emulation software is so good that he thinks it'll outperform Intel chips even though it's not running natively for ARM. \n\nSo basically, Apple made the right choice by ditching Intel.   \n\n\nAnd if Apple proves everyone wrong by coming out with incredibly great Macs thanks to their switch to their own Apple Silicon ARM-based chips, then there's a VERY good chance that the rest of the market will follow them and start developing ARM-based chips for laptops.\n\nThis will force Windows to start heavily investing in their ARM-based Windows software. \n\nAnd if you didn't already know.. Intel is FAR behind in the ARM-based chip world.   \n\n\nNow, the most common argument I hear is this: Apple is only a tiny part of Intel's business, and while that may be true.. the MOST important thing is the public's view of Intel.  \n\n\nThe tech community is already starting to despise Intel as a brand name because of their overpriced processors and the fact that AMD is beginning to CRUSH them. \n\nJust wait until Apple Silicon Macs start getting released and people realize that ARM-chips have a ton of potential, and they'll start hating Intel even more. \n\nThis will cause Intel's brand recognition and reputation to get absolutely destroyed in favor of AMD and Apple Silicon. This alone will lead to less market share. And what will happen if Nvidia or Apple buy out ARM? \n\nAnd by the way, there are now more and more ARM-based servers popping up, so there's a good chance that Intel will start to lose market share on the server side if ARM-based servers prove themselves. (They use less power so this makes sense for server farms)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically, what I'm trying to say is that Intel just got ditched by Apple.. and they're getting killed by AMD and TSMC. ARM is coming VERY quickly and Intel is NOT ready. They have been plagued with delay after delay, and all of this drama will ruin the confidence of their staff, leading to lowered productivity. It's not looking good for Intel for the long-term.  \n\n\nAs of right now, Intel stock is very cheap, and you might make a few bucks if you trade short term.. but I wouldn't hold Intel stock long term.   \n\n\nIf you want more in-depth info with visuals and extra details, you can check out two videos I made on the Max Tech Youtube channel: \n\n\"How Intel Lost the CPU Race..\"\n\n\"Apple Silicon ARM Chips vs Intel x86 Processors for Mac?\"\n\nHopefully you enjoyed this DD.",

So, basically as good as non-backed at all.  \n\nOptions are scarce.  \n\n**Alternative products**: CEF.  \n\n**GLD** \u2013 you all know this one. Biggest in the world. It is kinda physical, but no one ever seen that physical gold. Ran by a chain of subsidiaries of State Street Corporation. SSC, Vanguards, BlackRocks and others, are basically the ones who control the entire economy. Funny thing is that only The Trust\u2019s Authorized Participants can check or redeem physical gold from GLD ETF. Which basically means that only homies and cronies can tell if it\u2019s there. This fact among others makes some investors to doubt if there even is enough of physical in their vaults, or is it IOUs only. That\u2019s why I put in on 3 place.\n\nOptions are numerous for GLD.  \n\n**Alternative products**: IAU, 4GLD, IGLN, PHAU, GBS and many others.  \n\n**GDX** \u2013 here we come to the mining ETFs. Maybe your paranoia starts digging in your brain about what if there\u2019s no physical in the vaults. Maybe you\u2019ve listened lately to a short Peter Schiff rant for about 7 hours. Maybe you just want bigger gains on gold moves. GDX offers exposure to senior miners. Some people believe that \u2018senior miners\u2019 means that those mines will be in good jurisdictions where people tend to eat each other on a less regular basis. This couldn\u2019t be further from truth. Senior miners are only the miners with the biggest market cap. Newmonts, Barricks, RioTintos, Franco-Nevadas, AngloAmericans \u2013 that kind of companies. And many of them actually have mines in extremely risky jurisdictions, but this is offset by the mere mass of those companies.  \n\nOptions aren\u2019t as numerous as for GLD, but still more then enough to play.  \n\n**Alternative products**: RING, SGDM (Sprott and the company are probably the cleverest guys in the field), GOAU, EPGFX (yep, Peter Schiffs ETF. Memes aside \u2013 good performance).  \n\n**GDXJ** \u2013 basically explained above. Small cap miners. It is usually under 10 bil. companies. From my observations, junior miners go UP or DOWN 20% more than seniors on gold moves. This is rather accurate on a longer term, not necessarily on a daily basis. \n\n**Alternative products**: SGDJ.  \n\n**PPLT** \u2013 we finally left the realm of gold and we find ourselves in platinum. I admit, I don\u2019t know much about it, but it is more volatile than gold and less volatile than silver. ETFs on platinum are very rare, and PPLT is the only one with a significant market cap.  \n\nOptions are not available.  \n\n**Alternative products**: PLTM, but it dwarfs in comparison.  \n\nSLV \u2013 poor people\u2019s gold, as they say. Silver moves after gold, but usually makes bigger moves. SLV is run by BlackRock, same as IAU. It tracks silver futures prices.  \n\nOptions are numerous.  \n\n**Alternative products**: SIVR, DBS. Avoid leveraged commodities like AGQ. And by God don\u2019t be stupid to buy ZSL thinking that it\u2019s a silver ETF: it is shorting silver, not longing.  \n\n**SIL** \u2013 major silver miners ETF. Similar relation to SLV as GDX to GLD. Offers bigger moves on silver price.\n\nOptions are available.  \n\n**Alternative products**: SLVP.  \n\n**SILJ** \u2013 junior miners of silver ETF. They are heavily exposed to big miners as well (Pan American Silver Corp, Hecla Mining, etc) but the majority of the fund is allocated in small cap companies.  \n\nDespite similar names SILJ is run by other company than SIL. Later is ran by Global X, mostly owned by Koreans, I believe. While SIL is two years younger and is managed by ETFMG.  \n\nFrom my observations SILJ doesn\u2019t offer that much of a difference in moves compared to SIL. Not as much as GDXJ to GDX, but still it is generally more volatile. And costs less.  \n\nOptions are available but spreads are rather bad.  \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[Reading on the internet is hard, so if you've made it so far \u2013 take a rest and enjoy this picture of a golden frog statue from Pre-Columbian Columbia. Don't you just love how 'Pre-Coumbian Columbia' sounds? ](https://preview.redd.it/1z53iwebgdf51.jpg?width=735&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b4a68d973dd11922b193a32bc01ba48177b4210)\n\nWe went from the most safe and stable precious metal ETF to the most volatile.  \n\nFew more observations that you might find useful: \n\n\\- Sometimes mining ETFs fall while the price of the underlining metal futures rise. This is often bound to the general stock market performance. Miners are still viewed as stocks and if S&amp;P falls \u2013 they sometimes fall too because A) people are stupid; B) some of the bigger index funds and asset management firms are also exposed to mining stocks. But it\u2019s mostly A.\n\nSuch days are the best moments to enter.  \n\n\\- Precious metals are viewed as a hedge against volatility and market crashes. That is not correct. Metals as investment are first and foremost hedge against weak currency and inflation. Want to know what awaits gold - Dollar index (DXY) is much more indicative than VIX.\n\n\\- How long will the bull run last? No one knows for sure. My crystal ~~meth~~ ball says that it will go on at list until elections. Likely after them too, especially if Biden wins (don\u2019t care about your political affiliations, but Biden will increase money printing for sure: he promises to expand the budget  even more and no tax increase can cover it). It is wise to combine short expiring options on metal ETFs with long expiring ones (March 2021+ long).  \n\n\\- I can not make any post without shiting on the FED, so here it goes: global OZ price was \\~19 USD from XVIII century up until 1920s. From then on the US dollar lost staggering 99% of it\u2019s value compared to gold. Source: Timothy Green's Historical Gold Price Table.\n\nThis whole gold move leaves me with bittersweet taste: I gained a lot but those gains come from destruction of everything I hold dear (in economical sense).  \n\nBut let\u2019s not get too philosophical here. Hope this post helps those who want to enter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR**: play with GLD if small pp, play with GDXJ and SILJ if big pp.  \n\nDisclaimer: this is not a financial advise and anime cat girls are overrated.",

        "selftext": "This is pretty basic broad strokes shit. All these finance talking head losers have been telling regular joes to pour their life savings in the airlines because you know ThEy'Re ChEaP aNd WhAt LiKe ArE pEoPlE gOnNa StOp FlYiNg??1 but right now buying airlines is like buying a company that incinerates dollar bills.\n\nI don't need to tell you airlines are in a tornado of shit. They're going to need another massive bailout AND a vaccine by end of year to keep the lights on. Government gave them a $25b allowance and said hey keep flying all your routes cuz you're like idk a public utility. Ok well the airline industry did $248b in revenue in 2019. That $25b is only going to carry the industry for 1.2 months.\n\nBut being mandated to fly light planes doesn't just decrease revenue, they're filling the fuel tanks with cash money and burning it across the country. Someone who read their 10-Qs can chime in on exactly how fucked that is, I just remember their earnings were fucking atrocious. Routes they would otherwise kill to reduce losses they just have to nut up and fly anyway. For this kind of cutthroat business with astronomical operating costs that is really really fucking bad for bottom line.\n\nAnd here's the real problem. The great vagina shaped stonk recovery is not materializing for raw air travel numbers. In May and June air travel rates showed steady growth. But in July it started to plateau hard.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wg84sm9a3bh51.png?width=2416&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=409603927b7e7f43c3d39226da027d561edbe2fc\n\nExtrapolating out, ASSUMING IF that steady traveler growth continued, we would have been looking at 4 months at least before approaching normal levels on the same trend. That would have been 9 months total from near total cessation of air travel to recovery. That would have been an airline industry revenue reduction of roughly $100b or a 40% haircut for the year. Assume 10% profit across the industry (very generous), their $25b profit for the year just turned into a $75b loss. $50b after trump bucks.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lab0u52c3bh51.png?width=2448&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0136273cd0ae638cbccf57b397610fae7eb4c3fa\n\nBut it's all so much worse than that assumption. They're mandated to fly loser flights, increased expenses from safety precautions, salaries to non-generating furloughed employees, juicy international flights cancelled cuz American passports are toilet paper right now.\n\nWorst of all, air travel has fallen out of that trend and there are no models to predict what happens next. When do people start flying again? When are Americans allowed to travel to popular vacation destinations like Afghanistan and South Sudan? Nobody knows or has the faintest fucking clue. Is JPOW just going to print them out of this?\n\nTLDR: If you buy anything buy puts, but honestly don't fucking play airlines, outlook is super grim, they've been shilled nonstop to \"low information traders\", nobody knows what they're worth, your DD is based on tarot cards, they're a black hole for cash, stimulus could drop tomorrow or the gov could say \"lol gl\". Straight up undiluted investing cancer.\n\nPos: cash it's the weekend piss off",

        "selftext": "# Happy Saturday r/wallstreetbets\n\n**Introduction**: This is my first options trade. I know that none of you know who I am here yet, but you can check my post history if you need to see credentials. I started trading with my friend from gifted class back in the day and we found PPL due to my pennystocks screener that i expanded the price parameters on. My friend is very talented at fundamental analysis, so we'll start with him first. I also want to say thank you to this sub, I have learned how to trade options in about a month, and I appreciate all of you autistic traders who have helped me out. Some of you have recognized me in the webull comments of the S&amp;P500 as I've started trading those weeklies. I use an algorithmic prediction based on 140,000+ analysts filtered through machine learning. But I might start making posts on Sunday Evenings for that soon, after i have proof of its efficacy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I assume no responsibility if this becomes a losing trade, and you agree to hold harmless if you decide to take any trades based off of any info contained within this post. These are not recommendations to buy or sell anything.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# PPL DD from the bro \n\nIm still looking at PPL, but so far: Gas and Electric utility company (like \\[ \\] for us) with 10 million customers and 7B+ in revenue. Quick reference, \\[ \\] is at \\~$32/share with 300mil in income. PPL is $26 with 500mil in income.  \nThey have **9 seperate filings of insider buys** on *July 2nd*. Also on *April 3rd*, *Feb 18th*, *Jan 18th* and *Jan 2nd*. I havent yet verified if they were all the same people every time. Again, still looking.  \nThey promoted a new President in the last couple months, amd the outgoing President ALSO placed an insider buy on his way out.  \nFinancials look good. They have plenty of capital, were barely affected by coronavirus from what it looks like, but that will be confirmed on Aug 10th, when they report 2nd Q earnings.  \nOverall it looks strong. Looks weird to most the fundamental research ive done because of the amount of insider buys. It looks like they had some small share dilution since 2q 2019 but I havent found it yet. Suffice to say it wasnt much, as it only dropped earnings/share a couple pennies Q over Q. Im not sure what to make of it other than the company's executives are buying more and more at every opportunity, their share price is less than \\[ \\]'s, while all financial indicators say it should be higher. Even pre-covid levels are lower than \\[ \\]'s pre-covid levels.  \nIt is a utility company, so they arent known for volatility in share price. It did jump up to $30 briefly in June. It was on a nice rise before the covid collapse\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBack to me, trevandezz. They also have earnings August 10. Someone told me one time that when analysts raise their price targets before earnings, its a good sign. Idk how valid it is lol, but I saw this on the News tab of Webull. If you can explain the other stuff in here please do:  [https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-ppl-a-buy-or-sell-right-now/](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-ppl-a-buy-or-sell-right-now/) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# How to Trade These Options\n\nPlease understand that I started learning how to trade options about a month ago, if I have screwed up any info, let me know. This is the part, where if you can't read charts you're gonna have a bad time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Firstly, here is a key for my charts*\n\n[Also, red candles are bearish, white are bullish](https://preview.redd.it/lw1cfbgbobe51.png?width=795&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bcea744bf8a5a2406ad598629beacf2734201e36)\n\nHere is the monthly chart for PPL. The end of the month is always a great time to check the monthly chart.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1dq992a1qbe51.png?width=1828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9236cec3dd70cb980c29a4f79ed37c45dba6eb78\n\nFrom the Monthly chart, it looks like the bearish trend has reversed, as the June candle didn't engulf the previous candle, and July just completed a bullish hammer reversal candle. When we use the fibonacci tool to measure this current bullish trend, we can see that this retracement dipped into the 50% fib area (pink box), which is cool for me. The 127 fibonacci extension gives us a monthly (long term) target of $33.58, which is also confluence with weekly resistance in that area. And honestly that seems like a better valuation of this company. The price was actually at $36 in January before the beer flu hit. Do with that info what you will \n\n# As we zoom into the weekly\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u04dmef1sbe51.png?width=1828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7ed380244876e84428f6f1302bda78e4a99989c\n\nThe weekly chart has broken out of this range that it's been trading in. Great sign. The daily chart is basically the same info, if it can break through this next resistance, our short term target is $27.20\n\nNow, on to the options.\n\nI don't know how you bros do it, but I always just assume the contract will expire worthless and use that as my risk for the trade. You only want to lose $5,000 on this trade if we're wrong? Buy qty 75: 27c 8/21 [Options Profit Calculator](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html)\n\nThe price has to drop $3.67 for these contracts to be worthless next week before earnings. If the price moves in the upwards direction $3.67, your contracts are worth $18,000. If the price hits our final target of $33.58, you'll have $43,875. To me, I think we could hit $30.79 this upcoming week. Previous weeks have spiked in that same percentage, putting those contracts value at $25,200.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe IV charts look dope too, it's below the 252MA which is a buy sign to me. You never want to buy options when IV is over extended, pretty sure that's how people get IV crushed.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w1c3dg2zwbe51.png?width=1451&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebc1111b5a5c7906101478718aaa2285714bb46f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheta is literally $1.50 per day on each contract. Delta is $33, which is good right? Heres the option chart. Notice how these contracts hold their value quite perfectly til expiration. Hitting our target at $33.58 is a $43,000 profit. YUH\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rwgsthg9xbe51.png?width=703&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b220ce8a9a8c641e6d8f58a46735cc4130f4990c\n\nCheers bois",

Your typical average job; grocery store, restaurant, mall, cell store, gas station, movie theater staff etc as the list goes on makes $8-$15 an hour. So let\u2019s break down $15 per hour!\n\n$15x40hours =$600 weekly at your shot job\n\n\nUnemployment 0 hours worked = $300-$600 weekly. With added $600 stimulus is $900-$1500 weekly. With the minimum $200 stimulus republican proposal you will continue to get $500-$800 weekly. Would you go back to work?\n\n\nBlah blah companies can report them. Well Covid waived unemployment claims effecting businesses rates on unemployment insurance from going up. If you got a ppp loan you are now reporting outside of that it\u2019s more of a hassle for the employer to report them.

Because everywhere you go and almost everything you do some employee makes $15 an hour or less and will sit on their ass now instead because they make the same money.

You can not live happily without it anymore and most families need two incomes vs you used to sustain with 1. For decades Corp businesses have continued to raise prices on each other to beat bottom lines while the working people get fucked and pay more for everything. Meanwhile you made $40k 20 years ago and now make $50k to do the same job. Though you pay 40-400% more for everything; rent, power, gas, cars, groceries, gas, phones, etc making it impossible for someone to live happily poor. Want to stock it it someone\u2019s ass! Do it to Corp America! We are bailing them out why????\n\n\nIn the end we are all fucked unless something is changed as they are running out of room for people to survive in wages for basic needs while Corp America gets richer.\n\n\nThis is why I tell my kid to own a business or work in tech!

This stock makes up 60% of my portfolio in shares and as of Monday 30% in 8/21 calls.   I know this stocks behavior and I've been waiting patiently for this moment to come for the past 3 months to repeat these results.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI made [this deleted post on Monday](http://removeddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i70yi1/simon_property_group_bout_to_explode/) that SPG was going to pop off because of the good news about the AMZN deal to occupy JC Penney's empty stores.  At the time I posted they were trading for $62 a share, and they are currently at $68.23 -  I deleted it because it started to get alot of upvotes and I had a moment of post nut clarity and became convinced you guys would ruin a good thing for me so I decided to rake in the tendies on it this week on my own without the riff-raff.

SPG has 92% of their mall portfolio open as of right now and foot traffic has increased tremendously since Summer began.  \n\n  \n**-ACQUISITIONS / PARTNERSHIPS**\n\nSPG has a literal fucking war chest of cash of nearly 2 billion dollars at their disposal and they have been very active in acquiring the bankrupt retail victims of Coronavirus.  While analysts speculated that buying these was a last ditch effort to save themselves the CEO has said these are strategic purchases because these brands have value, inventory, and presence and being able to acquire them for pennys on the dollar will yield great return on their investment.    In the past 4 weeks they've acquired and partnered with the following:\n\n[\\-  Brooks Brothers](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/brooks-brothers-bought-by-venture-backed-by-authentic-brands-simon-property-2020-08-11)\n\n[\\- Lucky Brand](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/07/06/simon-property-group-part-of-company-bidding-for-a.aspx)\n\n[\\- JC Penney](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/08/13/simon-property-group-and-brookfield-are-leading-bi/)\n\n[\\- Amazon](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/08/11/amazon-fulfillment-centers-in-malls-sounds-like-a.aspx)\n\n[\\- And they are still looking for others.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/10/simon-property-group-spg-reports-q2-2020-earnings-fell.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**-CONSOLIDATION OF COMPETITORS**\n\nMall owners who are not financially equipped to weather a prolonged downturn will ultimately go bankrupt and seek to be bought or disappear.  This gives SPG great positional strength to become stronger through attrition of competition.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-**REITS &amp; DIVIDENDS, SO HOT RIGHT NOW.**  \n\n This is about to be a safe haven stock for many as the market shifts money into REIT holdings from Tech.  Simon is the billion dollar giant still critically undervalued given their market position and immense size.   SPG pays out a fat dividend which makes it a very attractive long term hold for perpetual income, and they are set to announce their next one very soon.   Combine this with the fact that the stock will likely see a 100% return on its price in 2 years and the big money is going to be entering the chat very soon. \n\n**-WHEN DO WE REACH THE MOON ?**\n\nWell the flight got airborne last week to be precise.  I detected a major shift in the stock behavior leading into the market close last Friday which caught my attention (change in resistance, volume, timed volatility, upward movement etc.) .   The trading that followed  this week almost seemed like a test was being done on the stock to see how much pullback it would see with out heavy handed support from the algos.    [Today (Friday 8/14) the volatility went away and it was just steady large volume trading from start to finish](https://imgur.com/ehxNHIS).    This stock tends to leap when it gets unfucked, in the 5 months I've traded it the biggest gains I've seen have all taken place in premarket trading, usually on a Monday after a solid green Friday. ($63.5-$70 and $73-$90 in June, without markets being open) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL:DR -** I believe in the next 5 trading days SPG is gonna go brrrrr brrrr - **8/21 70c** will print ITM for a short term call and **1/15 100c**  for long term.    Godspeed autists\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[MY 8/21 POSITIONS](https://imgur.com/c4288965-51c1-4e7b-8da6-db24122fbf0e)",

        "selftext": "And not the fun kind, like Team Bulls vs Team Bears squaring off for the reward of profit. I mean the bad kind where our enemy is after our livelihood and freedom from a life of employee-servitude.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom a series of observations, what I can only now label as a bonafide \"revelation\" was born and I believe it to be in my best interest to plant this seed of consideration in the minds of my brothers-in-arms each day that we opt to expose ourselves to the mighty Market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course you've heard of the \"Robinhood Flood\" (actually, I just came up with that but, that you know what it is anyways speaks to my term-generation skillz--more of those on display later), but I believe those that actually use Robinhood are but a (signfigantly-sized) sect in a much larger group that, together, has formed an entirely new race of traders/investors that were wise, willing, and able to heed the call from the Market that offers the opportunity to begin the shift to a new generation of particpants that will lead in the rebuilding of our world (by ever-squabbling over a price so that we may extract personal gain). This crew, I will call \"New Money\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis new race, comprised of anyone and everyone that, for whatever reasons, was previously not-involved with the Market, but has stepped up to the plate and put their life savings at risk just to play the hardest-game-ever-played, going up against the currently-inhabitant race of \"smart money\" whom were previously known to not be fucked with, but whose hubris has lead to the destruction of our future and the exposure of a window to change that, clearly, many could not pass on the opportunity to have a peak through. This crew, responsible for everything from Oil Wars to perpetual Debt Servitude, I will \"Old Power\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the time of the signalling event, the inflows of New Money to the sacred ground was the talk of the town. In a moment of fear, the Old Power let slip just one message: \"This is...changing things.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs New Money educated itself and dove on every opportunity Old Power cut weight on to help navigate these uncertain waters, our YOLO-balls quickly proved to have been a valuable asset and led to some considerable funding to give this uprising the staying power it needed to suddenly become an actual concern of Old Power. After the public disgrace of a few of Old Power's most beloved heroes, the audience cheered; but, the response from Old Power was a stern \"Game on, then.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoon after, and seemingly overnight, I woke up one day to find a new power at play in the Market. What yesterday was easy was suddenly not. Our enemy had stopped running and turned around to unleash some hard-ball on their new threat. Anyone believing this was going to stay easy was, surely, mistaken and it was time to start earning our keep and flexing our intellect if further ground was to be gained. The Fun Flood-in phase had officially progressed to what I will call phase 2, \"War kinda sucks...\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince then, New Money appears to be holding it's own and doing well to sharpen their wit by preparing for the on-going battle with discussions and sharing of tactics, strategies, and tools in the reddit/facebook/message board communities. We've even got a nice handfull of our own would-be Youtube heroes that act as both on-boarding stations and news channels. Everyone is doing their part, and I just want to take this opportunity to say, \"fucking bravo!\". And with that, you're all up to speed, and I shall deliver warning which lead me here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOld Power seems to have uncovered a weakness we've exposed, and it seems to be an effective strategy being used to thin out our numbers and send our zealous comrades fighting on the front lines back to the unemployment line. If we're not careful and work to overcome this, Old Power may claim control of the power positions and leave what's left of us holding nothing but bags full of \"COVID Plays\" and \"Pennies-until-yesterday\", at which point they can go back to safely ignoring us as we finish ourselves off with a race to the bottom by trading each other the worthless positions we paid an arm for right before getting run over by a landslide that leaves us with less capital and pile of \"Precious\"es to waste our time self-soothing over (\"\\[$15\\] next week!\"). No, my dude; it's \\[$7\\] forever. If you're lucky.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, what's this weakness we've exposed and has recently been used to give a hard slap of frustration and doubt in the longevity of this lifestyle? That, I will call \"Overconfidence in the Obvious\". The obvious could be anything that typically indicates price heading in a particular direction. Maybe it's worked for you countless times before or comes from a source you trust. Maybe it's a good/bad earnings report, announcement of offering/close to one, a candlestick pattern, MACD divergence, bla, bla, bla. I'm telling you, we have entered into a time when anything and everything you trust as a reason to take position in anticipation of the resulting direction needs to be considered suspect and proceeded with more cautiously than you've ever needed to before, because your trust in \\[whatever thing\\] has started to be exploited by Old Power (I assume, because they're the only ones with the bankroll to pull it off). Anytime that anything happens that seems obvious \"tomorrow is going \\[up or down\\]\", I think you will begin to see more and more often, it will defy all logic and make a major move against most people's plays and ginormous transfers of New Money wealth will find it's way back to Old Power as they proceed to squeeze you harder than you have the solvency to endure for \\[the morning/afternoon/two days/the week/etc\\] until they snuff out the Gulla-bulls and then profit from letting go and holding all the cards while you think \"I fucking knew it!\" and pile back in, after which they just bounce leaving you with the salty taste of their patented Double-Fucking secret recipe and smaller account size that will eventually lead to the PDT bouncers showing you back outside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere it is then; proceed accordingly. My suggestions: remove the word \"sure\" from your trading vocabularly, wait to see what happens before taking a position, cut your losses early and not to just wait until \"ok, there it goes!\". Maybe we can throw them off a little by hyping the opposite of what we really intend to do on social media? And keep buying up those metals. Whoever wins this contest is going to them to survive the transition, and the later you get in, the lower your old:new wealth ratio is going to be. Hopefully I'll catch you on the flip side and not breaking in to rob my pantry next year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nViva la revoluci\u00f3n.",

        "selftext": "I am seeing a shit load of new treads discussing the following-\n\n1. Fastly vs NET\n2. Hold Fastly or let go?\n3. What does Fastly do? \n\nSo I will clear up a few myths just in case. \n\nFastly is a CDN provider, which allows their clients to host their website on Fastly's servers. Fastly's business model is catered towards large enterprises that are looking at fastest (thus the name!) cold start time, i.e. time it takes to load a webpage on mobile/PC. Here are a few of their clients-\n\n1. **Clients doing very well during Covid**\n\n* Reddit\n* Shopify\n* Wayfair\n* Pinterest\n* Twitter\n* Stripe\n* Overstock\n* Shazam\n* Wealthfront\n* Etsy\n* Tiktok\n\n2. **Clients doing not so well during Covid**\n\n* Airbnb\n* Jetblue\n* Trip Advisor\n* Alaska Air\n* Kayak\n* Yelp\n* Kayak,\n* and many more....\n\nNotice first that their clients that are booming right now are very likely to continue booming for the next year or so. Once we are done with Covid (that is if), revenues will switch to clients in hospitality business, which typically have a strong business during normal times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFastly's USP is fastest cold start time, i.e., it is the best CDN in the market which allows the visitors on their client's website to load the webpage/apps faster than anyone else in the market right now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why is this USP so important**\\--well there are a few reasons why Fastly will continue to have higher growth rate.  I have noted a few down below-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Apple rolls out 5g iPhone later this year. They will require webpages to load faster. Fastly is the best CDN there is to handle that request. This does not mean that Akamai or NET are sitting out catching honeybee, but really means that Fastly is positioned to serve that switch to 5g better than NET or Akamai IMO.\n2. Fastly's business model is unique. It charges their customers based on the bytes loaded, which translates to the amount of time people spend on their customers' website. Thus, while I am spending 5-10 mins to write this essay, Reddit is getting charged by Fastly (pun intended!). Notice that this is a different business model than NET. NET offers a free subscription to begin with and has lower CDN hosting rate for those willing to host on their servers. Therefore, organizations which do not feel that speed is of concern to them as much, prefer to use NET. On the flip side, Fastly has a niche set of customers who value speed, because user experience on their website is of utmost importance to them. Imagine if I had to spend several 100 microseconds for a webpage to open, I would be pissed and may not go on that website, purely because of that reason.\n3. YoY growth based on investor's copy was 62%, which is great if you ask me. As long as it is staying above 50, my money is parked there.\n4. Bergman and Josh raised guidance for this year, during a time when a lot of CFOs are holing on giving guidance. Also of importance is that these folks in the C suite like to give a conservative guidance and beat it. In other words, promise less and deliver more. This leaves no question that next earnings should be a beat but do not take my word on it because who knows what happens tomorrow.\n\n**Influence of Tiktok on Fastly's revenue**\n\nCertainly one of the most important question that needs to be addressed because Tiktok constitutes 12% of the revenues. With the stock dropping like a rock after ER and then earnier today after Donny decided to ban it after 45 days, looks like a lot of the uncertainty is already baked into the price at this moment. Those who were uncertain unboarded the train today. That point is the exhaustion point where bulls come in and drive the stock higher (e.g., Chegg today).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI personally feel that Tiktok MSFT should be a done deal and they are waiting to announce this sometime this month. I am neither an insider nor do I happen to know the actually outcome. However, I do follow hedge fund option sentiment and I have noticed bullish calls inflow for MSFT this past couple days. While I am a peasant who is not connected to anyone involved with the deal, I am sure some of these whales are aware of the decision, which is part of the reason for that bullish call inflow for MSFT.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Should you dump FSLY or not?**\n\nEntirely up to you but I see a lot of growth in this company. Fundamentally, nothing has changed in how they operate. The company gave an upward guidance and that drives the stock in forward direction. Some sellers left the ship because a lot of RH investors have not seen losses in their life or some are not even aware of the potential of this company, except it became a meme stock lately and FOMO drove a lot of noobs in FSLY train.\n\nIt is always better to curtail losses. If you trust that they will continue to bring in revenues, I would dollar cost average on every dip. This ensures your average cost of the share is reduced significantly with any dip. Most fund managers actually add stocks to their funds when the stock is sitting at 30 day MA. Fastly had such a quick run up that the 30 day MA kept moving. All of that being said, I think it may rest for some time before beginning the next leg up. That could be a week, 2 weeks, or a month but you will have to be patient if you do not want to loose money. However, never panik sell on a red day because that is literally the day people like me buy from people who are selling. \n\nWould Monday bring a ray of light and we open green-\n\nNo one knows what happens but I would continue to DCA on every 5% drop. I remember when Square dropped a couple years ago, I kept DCAing and here I am sitting on gains. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope this helped convince some of you.",

        "selftext": "I see a ton of talk and speculation on this sub about airlines - some good but some totally wrong and showing a clear lack of understanding of the industry instead, but more so how COVID is affecting it. I am an experienced airport operations manager who holds a BS in Aviation Management, so I hope that I can provide a bit of insight. I\u2019m not a financial advisor so I can\u2019t advise you to actually buy or sell anything. A lot of my info is coming from internal docs so I can\u2019t share them as they contain information that can\u2019t be shared. The information I share is likely verifiable with other public sources. \n\nObviously we\u2019re all aware that traffic is way down. But to show you how much it is, in the USA the daily average passenger throughput at a commercial service airport this time last year was approx 2.5M. The past four weeks have been hovering at ~750K and are now starting to decline with the most recent data showing just shy of 700K and likely declining through September. Speaking of, airlines have been publishing massive schedule reductions (feel free to buy a Diio subscription if you want data) through September and continue to do so week after week. There is some hope in that the October schedule is being elevated but my personal take is that they are just pushing the schedule in hopes something changes. Hawaii flights have been doing this for months - just having their schedules pushed each month Hawaii renews their quarantine orders. The only somewhat stable international travel I\u2019ve noticed is Mexico flights which are, for something reason, even growing in some capacity. All of this is to say that just because your state is opening doesn\u2019t mean that air travel is returning yet. In fact, I see it declining until the holiday season which is actually normal in a seasonal sense, but is much more drastic right now. \n\nDoes that mean you shouldn\u2019t invest in airlines? I don\u2019t think so. I think that there needs to be a bit more waiting as the aviation industry tends to lag behind general industry and we\u2019ll see some more discounts on airlines like we did back in March. EXCEPT for maybe Southwest because they have insane cash reserves. Also remember that airlines are not \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d in the laymen sense. I see a ton of talk on this sub like \u201cTrump would never let American Airlines go under!\u201d It\u2019s not up to Trump, and he would - especially if he had a shiny penny to make off of it. Airlines go under all the time. American is actually a conglomeration of bankrupted airlines at this point. American as a label will probably exist forever, but they could bankrupt and send shares to $0 in the process. \n\nThis does not mean that aviation is doomed forever as I\u2019ve seen on this sub. Do you really think that the fastest and safest transportation method known to modern society will stay dormant forever? Even if Covid never ends our society will perform its own large scale Darwinism experiment. People will fly to Disneyworld or wherever regardless as long as someone is willing to sell them a ticket.  \n\nIm sorry that this post became more of a rant, but I had no real focus for it in the first place. Let me know if you have questions and I\u2019ll try to answer.",

        "selftext": "In Alaska, I met a naturalist who told me about sociopathic bears.\n\nDuring spawning season, the rivers are chock full of salmon struggling against the current. They do this until they are just about to die, whereupon they release their \u201cproduct\u201d and shuffle off the mortal coil. The stronger they are, the further they get, the best milt inseminating the best roe. Thus natural selection unfolds. \n\nThese are not salmon you want to eat. The fresh water fucks up their flesh, so that by the end of their journey they look like zombie fish and smell just as bad. But bears love them, and the good news is that there are millions of these fish trying to live out their natural purpose. So bears come down from the hills to jam as many as they can into their gullet before it\u2019s time to hibernate. In fact, bears are compelled by their own natural calling to do this. Sometimes you will see one by the river half-heartedly swiping his claws at the water, though his eyes are clearly saying \u201cJesus Christ, I\u2019m full.\u201d\n\nBefore you get carried away, this is not an analogy about market shorts being gluttons for rotten shit nobody else wants. \n\nIt\u2019s also not analogy about retail investors swimming upstream until they die or get eaten. \n\nThose are for another day.\n\nIn their world, each bear has an implied territory and if another bear gets within range, they take it very seriously. When this happens, they will stop what they are doing, make threatening moves and so on. If neither bear stands down, *it\u2019s go time*. During spawning season this poses a problem because there are a lot of fish but only so much river, and it\u2019s pretty common for a sort-of-hungry, more-kind-of-peckish bear to shamble down and accidentally enter the territorial radius of another. Suddenly, both are faced with a standoff neither expected. Both of them know that there\u2019s no real reason to fight \u2013 there\u2019s plenty to go \u2018round - so this usually ends with the encroaching bear being like, \u201cSorry bruv, my bad,\u201d walking an appropriate distance downriver and all is well. Sometimes, though, one of the bears is like, \u201cHey, is that Carl? Fuck you, Carl!\u201d, and the threats escalate. Then a throwdown happens, all teeth and claws, until one of them runs away.\n\nThems the rules of bear society.\n\nSometimes a bear is big and aggressive and pushes his luck. Sometimes a bear is small and cowardly, and never does. Sometimes a bear is just young or dumb, doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s breaking the rules and gets clobbered when he doesn\u2019t expect it. \n\nBut there is another kind of particularly fucked-up bear. This bear fully understands the rules of bear society and knows how events will unfold depending on how he acts. He knows other bears generally won\u2019t fight unless they have to because they don\u2019t want to get hurt. He knows the reasons to fight are particularly low at this time of year. \n\nHe\u2019s also a lazy motherfucker who doesn\u2019t want to do the work of catching fish himself.\n\nSo this smart, lazy bear will stand downriver from another bear he can see but is out of territorial range. The moment that other bear catches a fish, he will run towards it aggressively. Now, this other bear who thought everything was chill sees this other bear suddenly coming at him and is like, \u201cOh shit!\u201d He drops the fish he just caught and rears up, bracing himself for a throwdown against this charging psychopath. But the lazy bear isn\u2019t coming in for a fight. No. Instead, he snatches the fish and just runs away. This leaves the other bear, *sans* salmon, completely flummoxed at what just happened. It takes him a little while to get over the audacity of that asshole to get back to what he was doing.\n\nThe naturalist explained that within social mammal groups, there are always roughly 4% that act in such bald and selfish way, fully grasping social convention but manipulating it to maximum advantage. These individuals do not actually feel shame or rejection the way the rest of the group does. \n\nWe know them as sociopaths, and they tend to do very, *very* well until (and unless) their behavior is caught on to and they are culled from the group in some way. \n\nThe reason there can only be a ratio of up to one sociopath for every twenty-four \u201cnormal\u201d members, he explained, is that this is the most a group can withstand before the social order totally breaks down. No one trusts each other, and everyone is a suspect.\n\nToo many sociopaths in a group, you get the Salem Witch Trials.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce in a while, I meet someone who rocks the pillars of how I view the world. Chris was one of those people.\n\nIn the summer of 2007, I was doing pretty well. I had owned my own home for almost two years and had mostly recovered from that particularly massive purchase (any family man who has done the same will know what I am talking about). I had a few months of emergency savings, started a college fund for my kindergartener, had a little money socked away in a 401k, and paid the family car paid off. I had a full-time job and a side hustle, so I didn\u2019t have a lot of spare time. I decided to splurge and hire a guy from Craigslist to mow my lawn.\n\nEnter Chris.\n\nChris was five years younger than me, but somehow owned 5 houses. He lived with three other guys in one of them and rented the rest out. These guys were real bros, complete with the baseball caps and devil-may-care attitude reminiscent of Bill and Ted - like a fraternity, minus the college. They had no real skills, so they did this yardwork gig for pocket money. Chris was making a killing on the houses. \n\nThis was the height of the housing bubble, you see.\n\nChris explained that every few months or so, he either refinanced or took out another HELOC on the properties, each having appraised 5%, 10% even 20% since the previous time, tens of thousands of dollars at a cycle. Prices kept appreciating, so he kept taking out cash. Chris thought it was hilarious how the banks were practically throwing money at him. He made it a point to put as little of his own money in the properties as possible, drawing them down to the hilt and putting the proceeds into savings accounts. He used multiple banks due to the FDIC limits, which were $100k at the time. \n\nI was blown away. I asked him what would happen when the bill came due? I will never forget his answer or how he said it, with that stupid grin and stupid red cap and stupid sleeveless shirt, standing on my porch that hot summer day:\n\n\u201cWhen all this ends, they can take the houses, but they can\u2019t take the money.\u201d Then he laughed. \u201cThey can\u2019t!\u201d\n\nA year-and-a-half later, I was begging a parking attendant to let me out of the airport parking lot. I had used a credit card to put my car into the garage, the last one that wasn\u2019t maxed out. I had just returned from L.A. for orientation for a job that paid half of the one I\u2019d been laid off from months ago, and while I was there the bank cancelled the card. I had nothing else with which to pay the parking fee, all my other funds having been drained from an accident with an uninsured motorist and the monthly grind of bills that are always due. \n\nI was, for the first time since I had been an adult, absolutely-not-even-two-nickels-to-rub-together fucking broke.\n\nI had never felt so humiliated in my entire life, and this grizzled, hardened, world-weary woman in the booth had my fate in her hands. She could by all rights impound my car, and then I would be in some real hurt.\n\nShe assessed me for a long time, then simply opened the gate.\n\nI don\u2019t know whatever happened to Chris. I never got his last name. I imagine him running some sort of hustle somewhere, and I expect he is doing well. Despite my tone, I don\u2019t wish him ill \u2013 don\u2019t hate the player, hate the game. This kind of gamesmanship is how people get ahead all the time. \n\nBut thirteen years later, I still can\u2019t help but think of him as being somehow lesser than me. This is entirely the sin of self-pride, I know. I can\u2019t help it. He understood what was happening far better than I did \u2013 hell, better than *most* of us did. Despite appearances, he was a shrewd man who grasped that we were on a merry-go-round of stupidity, backed by social norms nowhere close to what the actual consequences of violating them would be. While most of us followed the rules and honored the social contract, we suffered while people like Chris profited. Laughing all the way to the bank, as they say.\n\nSo who is the lesser in this equation?\n\nChris\u2019 outlook and actions were the very definition of Moral Hazard. \n\nMoral Hazard is a term experts throw around when the Plebs find a hole in the system that they can exploit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy [last post](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i5mgqn/why_yolo_is_better_than_boggle/) was received fairly positively, but as with all things internet there were\u2026 *detractors*. There was considerable concern for my lack of faith in the market indices. There was disgust at my telling impressionable young fools to put all their retirement funds into FDs instead of something sensible like an index fund. But most of all, there was desperate need to point out how stupid I was for not having saved enough money to prevent tapping into my 401k when disaster struck. One commenter believed I should have foreclosed on my house before ever touching my retirement fund.\n\nUnderstand clearly: I own all my choices, past present and future. I take responsibility for all the mistakes and the consequences, and I do not blame \u201cthe system\u201d for the situations I found myself in. I do not claim to have made perfect financial choices, but I stand by the choices I made with the information and values I had at the time. \n\nTo blame the world for your problems is the ultimate in weakness of character. Doing so is to resign yourself to being a spectator in your own life. \n\nFurther, as a point of pride I want to establish that I have honored every contract I have ever entered. I have defaulted on occasion, but I paid back every dime I ever borrowed plus the appropriate interest and fees. I did not have to. I could have let my accounts go to collections and pay 50 cents on the dollar to resolve the debt. I could have walked away from my house when it was $100k underwater. For how long it took to rebuild my credit and recover my losses from what they now call the Great Financial Crisis, it would have been the smart thing to do. \n\nIt\u2019s just not how I do things. And if I may be so bold to speak for others, it\u2019s not how most of us to do either.\n\nBut as an older, wiser man, I now understand that it is not how *everyone* does things. There are a considerable number of people \u2013 4%, in fact \u2013 that only care about the rules insomuch as how they can benefit from them personally. Not only are they banking on most people following the rules, they understand that those people are unprepared to react when they *don\u2019t* \u2013 and not even have the courtesy to feel bad about it. These predators are ever present, and thus the \u201cnormal\u201d among us must remain ever vigilant.\n\nAs Machiavelli says, just because you abhor the rules of power does not prevent them from being used against you.\n\nAs we watch the drama of PRPL unfold, we can see a social struggle regarding intent play out. Some people are angry, feeling scammed by the champions of this ticker. Others profess a kind of strange fealty, denouncing the angry ones and doubling down on their faith. The champions themselves speak to the faithful, assuring them of their own well-meaning and shared experience. It muddies the waters, and one doesn\u2019t really know what to think.\n\nI don\u2019t pretend to know the motives of these guys. I had no skin in the PRPL game. For all I know, they are fine folk who are simply zealous believers.  I have seen this story unfold several times, however. \n\nRegardless of all that, *you must own your own decisions*. If you chose to back the play and lost money \u2013 and some of you lost a *lot* of money - that is entirely on you. Same goes if you listened to that great WSB prophet Variation\\_Separate, if you followed Cramer on one of his many shitty plays, or just hit a spinner and clicked \u201cbuy\u201d. How you reflect upon this, what you learn from it and how you choose to act upon the lesson are what matters.\n\nMost people are generally good, just trying to provide for their families or perhaps buy a Lambo. But the world is also filled with people who would skin you in a heartbeat if they thought they could sell your hide for a nickel, and they do exceptionally well in a world obfuscated behind corporate entities, computer screens and internet handles. Best not forget that when entering any transaction. That goes doubly so when following the advice of strangers. Even me.\n\n*Caveat emptor* \u2013 buyer beware.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn any investment prospectus, you will usually see two phrases: \u201cpast performance does not guarantee future results\u201d and \u201crisk of loss up to and including the entire investment.\u201d These are the only real truths in the world of business \u2013 perhaps even life. Everything entails risk, even doing nothing. Anything can happen tomorrow. And the world, I\u2019m afraid, is in no shortage of some real and true fuckers.\n\nRather than allow this reality to paralyze me, it liberates me. Passive investing, in my view, is also no better than being a spectator in one\u2019s own life. This is not to say I\u2019m going to day-trade my life savings on YOLOs, or that I won\u2019t be patient and let certain investments mature. But I refuse to just \u201cSave, Buy, Hold and Diversify\u201d and allow all control to be passed off to the whims of an ever more capricious market. Fool me once and all that.\n\nThe more you learn the rules of business and finance, the more you will find opportunities. Some opportunities are illegal, and others you will find distasteful. You should certainly avoid those - you aren\u2019t a sociopath, after all. But you will find many, many tasteful opportunities often disguised as risk and/or hard work. The best of them, I would say, are those where everybody wins.\n\nSome of my previous detractors pointed out that options are a zero-sum game, or as Theta Gang puts it, \u201cthe other end of your win is someone else\u2019s loss.\u201d Perhaps. *Perhaps*. With an ever-increasing NAV of the equities market, I am skeptical of this assertion. Further, I have bought options that expired worthless as part of a strategy I profited from and sold options that I am certain were used to hedge an otherwise profitable position. Besides that, I think it\u2019s worth pointing out that as of 2017 [1% of the world owns half the money](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/14/richest-1-percent-now-own-half-the-worlds-wealth.html) \u2013 and most of the other half aren\u2019t in this market. The likelihood that your winning option just fucked over a fellow retard is far less likely than it is of having sapped a hedge from some fuck who doesn\u2019t know what else to do with all his wealth.\n\nTherefore, I reject the notion that every smile creates a tear when trading options. \n\nLastly, anyone who tries to quote you the \u201cstable\u201d returns of the S&amp;P 500 should also be made aware of its regular [30%+ YoY swings over the past 60 years](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042415/what-average-annual-return-sp-500.asp). This is not a safe place to park your money, and someone is profiting handsomely from telling people that it is. These are the \u201cMarket Makers\u201d, the players buffeting your passively invested retirement funds back and forth like a bowling ball going down a lane with bumpers. They don\u2019t give a shit about what you plan to do with that money in thirty years, just that you put it into the market *right fucking now*. Don\u2019t ever make the mistake of thinking they have your best interests at heart.\n\nMy great sin is believing you shouldn\u2019t let these assholes just have at it with the resources you expect to keep you going into your old age. \n\nIt\u2019s hard for a person to really grasp the *trillions* of dollars at play. Take a pair of night-vision binoculars into the woods on a new moon, look to the sky and you will get a notion. These people and institutions are playing with all that money because they don\u2019t have any idea what to do with it, just that they want more. But by virtue of holding a Social Security Number, you get to sit at the same massive table \u2013 and I\u2019m guessing you have a pretty good idea what *you* would.\n\nSo I am going to say it again, because it is worth repeating: we live in a Merchant Republic awash in wealth. Go out and get your fucking slice. \n\nYou aren\u2019t special \u2013 but neither are they.\n\nI love you retards.",

        "selftext": "https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-real-weak-spot-in-ubers-earnings-report-2020-08-07\n\n&gt; Uber (NYSE: UBER) Eats was supposed to be Uber's saving grace during the pandemic.\n&gt; \n&gt; Demand for its ridesharing services has plunged as people around the world work from home and traditional entertainment and socializing options remain mostly unavailable -- however, demand for food delivery has skyrocketed for the same reasons.\n&gt; \n&gt; Those trends played out as expected during the second quarter. Overall revenue declined 29% to $2.24 billion, but revenue in its mobility business, which was formerly called rides, tumbled 67% to just $790 million. Meanwhile, revenue from delivery, which was previously called eats, surged 103% to $1.21 billion as demand for restaurant delivery increased.\n&gt; \n&gt; Uber reported an adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) loss of $837 million for the quarter, which excludes special costs related to COVID-19. Based on the numbers above, you would think the mobility business would be the primary culprit for the steep loss. But you'd be incorrect.\n&gt; \n&gt; An Uber Eats bag on a counter\n&gt; Image source: Uber.\n&gt; \n&gt; Delivery is a problematic business\n&gt; Despite the headwinds from the pandemic, the mobility business still generated an adjusted EBITDA profit of $50 million, while delivery lost $232 million on an adjusted EBITDA basis. Even with revenue doubling from a year ago, that was only a modest improvement from the $286 million loss in the segment in the quarter a year ago -- and that includes Uber's decision to exit several underperforming Uber Eats markets in the past year, including India and South Korea, as management said it will only compete in countries where it can be No. 1 or No. 2 in market share.\n&gt; \n&gt; For a while now, it's been evident that third-party restaurant delivery is a problematic business. Competitors like Uber and DoorDash have lost billions battling for market share gains. Grubhub, the former leader, has seen its profits disappear. Increasing competition has led to heavy spending on discounts and marketing, and restaurants often resent third-party delivery companies that charge steep fees that often make delivery orders unprofitable. During the pandemic, restaurants and cities have pushed back on the model, limiting the fees that third-party delivery providers can collect.\n&gt; \n&gt; Uber's latest report also underscores another problem with the app-based delivery model. \n&gt; \n&gt; No scalability\n&gt; The coronavirus pandemic has been a gift to e-commerce and delivery businesses. Companies like Amazon, Shopify, Wayfair, and Etsy saw sales skyrocket during the second quarter, and profitability also surged along with it as these companies leveraged the windfall sales from pandemic-related demand onto the bottom line. Wayfair, for example, posted its first profitable quarter in its history as a public company, as revenue jumped 84% to $4.3 billion and it reported a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net profit of $273.9 million. In the quarter a year ago, Wayfair lost $181.1 million on a GAAP basis, meaning it experienced a turnaround of nearly $500 million.\n&gt; \n&gt; Uber, on the other hand, could not deliver a profit in its delivery business, despite the surge in sales. Since Uber doesn't break out costs by business segment, it's unclear exactly why the delivery business lost so much money. But Uber did drop one clue in the earnings release.\n&gt; \n&gt; Uber often pays excess driver incentives for its deliveries, and acknowledges that \"cumulative payments to Drivers for Delivery deliveries historically have exceeded the cumulative delivery fees paid by consumers.\" Unlike in mobility, which is a higher-margin business because Uber directly provides the service that it's charging customers for, with delivery most of the payment goes to the restaurant, so Uber must pay its drivers out of restaurant and customer fees. There's simply less money to distribute and cover overhead costs. As the statement above shows, customer fees alone aren't enough to pay the driver, let alone overhead costs, so Uber must tap the restaurant for the remainder or lose money on the sale. That is one of the reasons that tensions have increased with restaurants, as many of them believe they are being charged exorbitant fees by Uber and its peers.\n&gt; \n&gt; Uber's adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 33 percentage points in the quarter, but that came while it pulled out of several weak markets, got a significant demand tailwind from the pandemic, and slashed $1 billion in annual expenses in areas like its corporate offices and research and development.\n&gt; \n&gt; After losing out in its bid to buy Grubhub, Uber made a deal to take over Postmates for $2.6 billion, and it is expanding into areas like grocery as it seeks to further build out its delivery network. The Postmates deal could help Uber gain much-needed leverage in food delivery, but for now, the economics of the delivery business look fundamentally broken, and expanding into new verticals is only going to weigh further on the bottom line.\n&gt; \n&gt; While the mobility business should return to health once the pandemic ends, delivery will be a drag on the business for the foreseeable future. That's one reason, among many, to tread cautiously with the stock. \n&gt; \n&gt; 10 stocks we like better than Uber Technologies\n&gt; When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*\n&gt; \n&gt; David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Uber Technologies wasn't one of them!

        "selftext": "That's right, your monthly update on the sector that the majority of people seem to hate and has a total market cap almost equal to that of Pinterest. Yes, even I was suprised about this. A sector that provides fuel for powering 20% of the entire US and around 10% of all power generation globally has a combined market cap equivalent to a website where you can look for pictures of furniture (extremely simplified but you get the point).\n\nBut I digress, for those of you who have not read my previous updates and DD, [here](https://amp.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hp9966/the_case_for_a_big_uranium_bull_market_and_what/) is a general market analysis and five stock suggestions, [here](https://amp.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/huo47l/uranium_miners_are_showing_big_growth_with_many/) is a market update and lastly [here](https://amp.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/i2bf4d/the_sector_that_returned_20x_50x_100x_and_even/) another update explaining the bullish views and recent drop. I would highly suggest you read these first before asking questions, since they will probably answer most questions you may have in the post itself or between the hundreds of comments. If you do have more questions, I will be more than happy to answer them for you.\n\nNow, let's move on to the big one, what is happening in the sector? Well it looks like 2021 is going to be the year all catalysts come together to form one incredible bull market for uranium. \n\nKazatomprom has publicly announced that their supply in 2021 will be severely impacted. Why is that? Because ISR mining in Kazakhstan is a lot like planting crops. A mining solution has to be put into the ground, which will go into the ore bodies and after between 4 and 7 months the solution can be pumped back out together with the uranium ore. The only problem is that the main 'seeding' months where between April and September, right before Kazakhstan winter. They have now missed their main mining time of the year, which means little to no new uranium will be pulled out of the ground next year for the first time in a long long time. With Kazakhstan responsible for just around 40% of the entire global supply of uranium, this impact will translate into a major supply deficit on top of the already existing supply deficit. This year it is estimated that there will be around 120 million pounds of uranium produced, where 180 million pounds was demanded. This means that inventory and mobile supply had to be used to fill this gap, further tightening the global supply of uranium. Let's talk about the wildest situation, which would be every single uranium producer, including at Olympic Dam, just ramps up to full capacity and sell everything into the market at whatever the current price is. Will that drop the price a bit? Sure it will. Will it take care of the deficit and prevent this bull market from happening? Absolutely not.\n\nIf this structural deficit happened to any other commodity, the price would absolutely skyrocket. So why hasn't uranium? Because there has been almost no talk of nuclear utilities, the main consumer of uranium, coming into the market to buy new fuel. This will change in 2021 and especially 2022 when 40% and 80% of all utilities in the US respectively will be out of contract and thus not getting their all important fuel for the nuclear power plants.\n\nThis contracting cycle comes at the same time as the biggest supply deficit we have yet seen, the closing of several high profile uranium mines, like Orano's Cominak mine, the lack of new uranium mines for at least the next 2/3 years and above all the increasing demand for uranium all across the globe make this entire sector a coiled spring. We do not know when it will go off, but the longer it stays this way the higher the jump and this jump will come. My guess is that there are several small bumps this year and that there will be a huge jump next year which will trigger a bull market that may even eclipse the likes of 2002-2007 and will last between 2-4 years depending on how long it takes for all utilities to sign new contracts and the market to be supplied well again, after which the market will come back down to 'normal levels'.\n\nLastly, there have been index funds who are restructuring their holdings to have more pure play exposure to uranium. $URA will move from 50% to 70%, adding 32 million dollars to the sector. With a sector that had such a small market cap, inflow of capital like this can move the needle substantially. Just imagine what will happen when the general investment community and all those people who made millions in the previous bull market decide to invest into the sector. That will do more than just moving the needle or spring the coil, that would put the needle and the coil into a cannon.\n\nAll signs point to this being the most asymmetrical risk/reward investment you can find in the market. I will not deny the risk it brings, but the potential rewards are so large that they easily write off any risk that might be involved investing in this sector. When all is set and done, those that invested early and held on through all the volatility will be greatly rewarded for their troubles.\n\nExtras:\nI highly suggest checking out people like Brandon Munro, the uranium insider, John Quackes, Crux Investor, Rob Chang and especially Mike Alkin who all have extensive information on the sector and the investment thesis.\n\nDisclaimer:\nUranium holds a 25% spot in my total portfolio, with significant positions in Cameco (CCO), Denison Mines (DNN) and Energy Fuels (UUUU).",

        "selftext": "After seeing that horrible PRPL meme  Id like to show why I like this company and not just the meme fomo. First if you haven't seen [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i0zaqh/prpl_nurples_why_purple_valuation_just_might_make/?sort=new) you should if you plan to invest, but you can skip for now and go to this vid where CEO talks about how when the business suddenly halted due to corona they were SUCCESSFUL at pivoting beyond expectations. Imagine you get fired, and shortly after you're doing fine again - that's called having brains and determination, a good sign.\n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP8ggnn9nK8&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP8ggnn9nK8&amp;feature=youtu.be) \n\nWhat I liked right away about this vid was how confident and optimistic the CEO was. He isn't mumbling he's on point and knows what's good and bad. Now watch how he talks about pivoting to making small beds to help out, and then to masks. And here is where it hit me. These dudes are SMART to  have had a very specific business  for 20 years, and then to start a new company to sell  product to retail, and make this much money in 5 years you gotta be pretty freaking smart. And then to be able to pivot and have a ton of money in May again, thats brilliant.  This is why PRPL is not just about beds, these dudes will find a way to provide value and make tendies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm up on PRPL and it helped my account after ass raping, but I converted almost all calls into shares last week to be more safe for my own sanity. I'll be looking to add more options and longer calls this week. It just looks like smart people that know what they're doing, that have values, and how to adjust and make money. Go PRPL. Please don't meme this wholesome stock and then bail at first 3% red day. After we up on earnings then sure I'll be right there with purple nails to join you.",

        "selftext": "Listen up fuckers.\n\n\nI\u2019m not ludicrously experienced with options, but I can recognize some bullshit when I see it. This arcticle [(Intel \u2018Stunning Failure\u2019 Heralds End of an Era for U.S. Chip Sector)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-stunning-failure-heralds-end-030711424.html) and a bunch of other \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b news caused $INTC to drop off the face of the earth last week. \n\n\nI kinda fail to see the drama. Intel has always outsourced it's chips. Maybe it's doing it more now, but even 8 years ago when my brother and I built our first PC's. His chip was from Mexico, mine was from Taiwan. \n\n\nFurthermore, TSMC, the company this article says Intel should sell factories to, has been the heavyweight chip maker for a decade or more.\n\n\nNvidia and AMD for example, they are the two graphics card manufacturers. BOTH of them have their chips made by TSMC. These companies do all their designing, but in the end everything is made by TSMC anyway. At least, a lions share of it.\n\n\nNow, Intel definitely has struggled in the recent market, but that's because they've demolished AMD in the performance chip market for nearly two decades. There was no reason to keep pushing their envelope, spending billions on R&amp;D for a better product. All they had to do was refine their Lake series processors and they'd continue to rake in a ton of profit. This profit was used to expand their market to the mobile industry. Particularly laptops. For a long time it was hard to get an apple product with any kind of processor that wasn't Intel.\n\n\nThey're not going away. They're not crashing.\n\n\nThey're just finally seeing AMD pass them in one market. This has caused other markets to start to shift due to uncertainty about who the \"best\" chip manufacturer is, but trust me - we will see Intel back with a fiery vengeance.\n\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if Intel pops out some high core count chips that are pushing 5.0-5.5 all core clock count speeds. Once they scale down their transistor size... Oof. It's going to be a Rottweiler back in the pit. \n\n\n\nTL;DR INTC $55c 09/18, but load up on whatever the hell you want, these contracts are CHEAP",

        "selftext": "This is actually my first DD I've ever posted so fuck you and forgive me if this doesn't work out for you.  \nI've been looking at $PSTG for a while now and if my buying power wasn't so fucked from my decision to buy 8/7 UBER puts, I would have been already all over this play. \n\nWhat got me looking into Pure Storage was some unusual options activity alert. I've looked into this company before but didn't entirely understand what they do. Now after looking at them again, I'm still not exactly sure wtf they do....BUT I've gotten a better understanding. Basically what I got from this research is that these guys fuck with \"all-FLASH data storage solutions (enabling cloud solutions and other low-latency applications where tape/disk storage does not meet the needs).\"......and ultimately what this all means to me is these motherfuckers make those stupid fast laser money printers with the rocket ships attached. That's something I'm interested in.\n\nNow, here is the D^(aily)D^(ick) you all degenerates have all been fiending for:  \n*Fundamentally*:  \n[Pure Storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Storage) remains one of the few hardware companies in tech that is consistently growing double-digits, yet remains constantly cucked and neglected by investors (trading at 1.9x EV/Sales). \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ek7ugjsewnf51.png?width=1118&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9c7e72c95e450a105e44223937422d896eeeb21\n\nThe 36 Months beta value for PSTG stock is at 1.62.   \n74% Buy Rating on RH.   \nPSTG has a short float of 7.28% and public float of 243.36M with average trading volume of 3.16M shares. This was trading at around $18 on Wednesday 8/5 when I started writing this and as of right now, it's about $17.33. \n\nThe company has a market capitalization of \\~$4.6 billion. In the last quarter, PSTG reported a ballin'-ass profit of $256.82 million. Pure Storage also saw revenues increase to $367.12 million. As of 04-2020, they got cash money flowing at $11.32 million . The company\u2019s EBITDA came in at -$62.81 million which compares very fucking well among its dinosaur ass peers like HPE, Dell, IBM and NetApp. Pure Storage keeps taking market share from them old farts while growing the chad-like revenues of 33% in F2019, 21% in F2020, and 12% in F1Q21. \n\nChart of their financial growth since IPO in 2015:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gwlmy82v4nf51.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6508cd5f641da4086b70d8b8007da034e982fd7\n\nAt the end of last quarter, Pure Storage had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1.274B, compared with $1.299B as of Feb 2, 2020. The total Debt to Equity ratio for PSTG is recording at 0.64 and as of 8/6, Long term Debt to Equity ratio is at 0.64.   \nEarning highlights from last quarter:\n\n* Revenue $367.1 million, up 12% year-over-year\n* **Subscription Services revenue** $120.2 million, up 37% year-over-year\n* GAAP gross margin 70.0%; non-GAAP gross margin 71.9%\n* GAAP operating loss $(84.9) million; non-GAAP operating loss $(5.4) million\n* Operating cash flow was $35.1 million, up $28.5 million year-over-year\n* Free cash flow was $11.3 million, up $29.0 million year-over-year\n* Total cash and investments of $1.3 billion\n\nI bolded the Subscription Services Revenue bullet because to me that's a big deal. Pure Storage keeps them coming back with products such as Pure-as-a-service and Cloud Block Store and everybody knows that the recurring revenue model is best model. Big ass enterprises buy storage from vendors such as Pure Storage in the cloud to prevent vendor lock-in by the cloud providers. $$$\n\nWhat are Pure Storage's other revenue drivers? Well these motherfuckers also have the products to address the growth of Cloud storage as well as products to drive the growth of on-prem storage. For on-prem data center, Pure sells Flash Array to address block storage workloads (for databases and other mission-critical workloads) and FlashBlade for unstructured or file data workloads. On-prem storage revenue is mainly driven by legacy storage array replacement cycle.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/01su6chrwnf51.png?width=1129&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16e6a705f9392291bc0c3932c815802d9101365e\n\nSo far, it seems like Pure Storage's smart ass [CEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHE7X5Gt71o) has been spot on with his prediction of the flash storage sector's direction. Pure Storage's \"Pure-as-a-Service and Cloud Block Store\" unified subscription offerings is fo sho gaining momentum it. This shit is catching on with enterprises, both big and small. COVID-19 increased the acceleration of our digital transformation and our subsequent shift to the cloud. The increased demand in data-centers is going to drastically help Pure Storage's future top and bottom line and to top it off, **NAND prices are recovering** (inferred from MU earnings). I expect Pure Storage to get some relief on the pricing front because of this which obviously in turn should improve revenues. \n\nPSTG's numbers look pretty good to me so far but are they a good company overall? Even when scalping and trading, I don't like to fuck with overall shitty companies so I always check for basic things like customer satisfaction, analyst ratings/targets, broad-view industry trends, and hedge fund positioning.. that sort of thing.   \n**Pure Storage stands out in all of these fields for me.**   \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4n0e5nve5of51.png?width=373&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=495416bb6f5a2dab77f3ac483ca4d9510b39037c\n\nCustomers like Dominos Pizza and many others all seem to be happy AF with no issues. I can hardly even find a negative review online. The products seems to be universally applauded. Gartner and other third party independent analysts also consider Pure Storage's product line-up some of the best in the industry. \n\nThe industry average for this sector is a piss poor 65.  \nPure Storage has a 2020 Net Promoter Score of [86](https://customer.guru/net-promoter-score/pure-storage)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3w51io8yvmf51.png?width=698&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f7d06825d0ad9d126216e5069af2f9c3636f86a\n\nEnterprises are upgrading their existing storage infrastructure with newer and modern data arrays that are based on NAND flash because they're forced to keep up with the increasing speed of the future of business inter-connectivity. This isn't changing because of the pandemic and this isn't changing in the future.. The newer storage arrays are smaller, consume less power, are less noisy and do not generate excess heat in the data center and hence do not need to be cooled like the fat fucks at IBM need to be. Flash storage arrays in general are cheaper to operate and are extremely fast, speeding up applications. Pure Storage by all accounts makes the best storage arrays in the industry and continues to grow faster than the old school storage vendors like bitchass NetApp, Dell, HPE and IBM. \n\nPure Storage\u2019s market share was 12.7% in C1Q20 and was up from 10.1% in the prior year - LIKE A PROPER HIGH GROWTH COMPANY.   \nHPE, NetApp and IBM, like the losers they are, lost market share.   \nAccording to [blocksandfiles.com](https://blocksandfiles.com/2020/07/03/gartner-all-flash-array-revenues-q12020/), AFA vendor market share sizes and shifts are paraphrased below:\n\n* \u201cDell EMC \u2013 34.8% (calculated $766m) vs. 33.7% a year ago\n* NetApp \u2013 19.3% at $425m vs. 26.7% a year ago\n* Pure Storage \u2013 12.7% at calculated $279.7m vs. 10.1% a year ago\n* HPE \u2013 8.4% \u2013 $185m vs. 10% a year ago\"\n\nPure has been gaining share almost every year since it began selling storage arrays in 2011. Pure Storage is consistently rated the highest for the completeness of vision as the following chart shows:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5agj17gcgnf51.png?width=428&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da9c6389baccab85261d6e0f71b3474e84b90d3c\n\n**Hedge Funds are on this like flies on shit.** \n\nAlliancebernstein L.P. grew its position in Pure Storage by 0.5% in the 4th quarter. Alliancebernstein L.P. now owns 104,390 shares of the technology company\u2019s stock worth $1,786,000 after purchasing an additional 560 shares during the last quarter. \n\nLegal &amp; General Group Plc grew its position in Pure Storage by 0.3% in the 1st quarter. Legal &amp; General Group Plc now owns 258,791 shares of the technology company\u2019s stock worth $3,213,000 after purchasing an additional 753 shares during the last quarter. \n\nSunbelt Securities Inc. acquired a new stake in Pure Storage in the 4th quarter worth $4,106,000. \n\nCENTRAL TRUST Co grew its position in Pure Storage by 79.8% in the 2nd quarter. CENTRAL TRUST Co now owns 3,226 shares of the technology company\u2019s stock worth $56,000 after purchasing an additional 1,432 shares during the last quarter. \n\nNorthwestern Mutual Wealth Management Co. grew its position in Pure Storage by 203.0% in the 1st quarter. Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Co. now owns 2,312 shares of the technology company\u2019s stock worth $28,000 after purchasing an additional 1,549 shares during the last quarter. \n\nAlso, everybody's favorite wall street TSLA bull, **Cathie Wood** has been busy steadily purchasing big lots of PSTG for her ARK ETF funds for a while now...Even going as far as selling TSLA in order to re-balance!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zjxuakjosnf51.png?width=1125&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f34abdd3b35791eb207d31d72ea0f6fb11beec30\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bkf1uzb2tmf51.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9870ec41cfb4ce468ba61d83f2f8a4151927a4e\n\n**Hedge funds and other institutional investors own 78.93% of the company\u2019s stock and it seems like more are piling in every day.** \n\nTons of active options, too -Pretty good volume lately with the spreads looking *decent*.\n\nOver 5,000 September $20 Calls added just on 8/3 alone \ud83e\udd14 \n\nOrder flow helps my thesis here, showing a recent influx of big dick money moving into PSTG.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/liychuhblnf51.png?width=592&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca6a60d54a9eb8bd9e32e0ef70992b8282c29e70\n\nGoogle Search Trends showing uptick in interest:  ^(SPY420 baby)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/joo0b9wxinf51.png?width=1710&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24eb18f18be18b9b771ff1911c09c5479ba2f1a0\n\nRobinhood Trends showing the YOLO is trending up\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4gk5yjdxmnf51.png?width=1538&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76c4b114c133c493c84386d1705f85229f5f7d44\n\nIncreased job postings on LinkedIn all across the globe, further supporting the idea that Pure Cloud Adoption is looking strong. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5zenasprznf51.png?width=1092&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a492e227e2208fe89925c9b7fe365634f7ffde6a\n\n*Technically*:  \nThis broke out through down-trend line a couple of days ago and as of right now looks to be pretty oversold. Looks like its found support at the 50 DMA and zooming out , the chart just looks like to me that it's coiling up for a big breakout. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wxtz8minmnf51.png?width=1208&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7baabbd3e8f97dfc8bd0d5bfa512613c2eea4921\n\nThese fucking shorts are going to get squeezed out hard.

If/when RSI breaks out, I want to play this thing aggressively with bullish call calendar spreads....THAT IS IF I HAD SOME FUCKING BUYING POWER (FUCK YOU UBER)....  \nSoooo really what I'll be doing is asking my wife's boyfriend sometime this weekend for a loan. That way on Monday I can buy some **$PSTG 9/18 $17.5 &amp; $20 calls** at open and YOLO my saddness away for a week.  \nGod forbid, I might even buy of those things called \"shares\" I heard about from /r/investing if at all possible because in all honesty, I really do feel like this is a good company to hold in a long term growth portfolio.  \nPure Storage is NOT looking like your average KODK prostitute to flip or scalp and actually more like someone you'd bring home to your 2 dads.   \n**EARNING DATE: 8/25**\n\nPure Storage has a history of beating estimates and rocketing up. Over the last 20 quarters, the company beat revenue 17 quarters by an average of $4.9 million or about 3%. Out of the three times that the company missed on revenues, once was due to supply fuck-ups at one of its distributors and the other two times were due to Average Selling Prices declining faster than the company forecasted. Higher-than-expected ASP declines (due to NAND oversupply) is one of the risks of the storage business...but then again NAND prices look to be recovering now if MU's earning isn't fucking with us and telling us fibs. Big money is forecasting revenue to be around $396 million, essentially flat year-over-year, and EPS of a disrespectful ass penny....Fuck that conservative ass guidance! I think PSTG is going to blow that shit out the water.  \nThis chart shows Pure Storage\u2019s past performance\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4xflpezdhnf51.png?width=623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1660a80a1a1821ef8098791a8cee632e25f1445\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2fuen3n65of51.png?width=373&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9737a8d2c2a04163f447cf6d0ee287b40235868e\n\nMy Prediction: After ER on **8/25**, Pure Storage will hit new 52 week highs.   \n$20.50  - $23.50 is my guess.

        "selftext": "The stock already had a short squeeze two months ago jumping from $10 share to $14 within a day (May 7)\n\nRevolve Group (RVLV) is a premium brand sponsored by the biggest and most famous Instagram influencers. They don't have physical stores and they sell everything online. They have a huge Instagram account with 4.1M followers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ckalg9svz8f51.png?width=748&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bca463954a43461367bf7e0e1e45baa3e15af580\n\nThe company is in great shape. **$103M in cash and only $30M of debt.** When they went public 4 years ago they were making $312M in revenue and $2M in profits. Today the revenue sits at $600M with **$50M EBITDA.** Crazy growth.\n\nNow the questions is: Why is the company down YTD? Well the company withdrew guidance due to the COVID-19 pandemic and many shorts piled in, **reaching a 40% short interest.**([https://fintel.io/ss/us/rvlv](https://fintel.io/ss/us/rvlv)). The analysts placed an estimate profit of $0.02 per share for Q2 because of the COVID impact and many shorts stayed.\n\nNow this is where things get weird. Last year the company made $0.18 per share during Q2 and analysts are only projecting $0.02 for this quarter, implying the company profitability will drop 89%.\n\nNow you have to be autistico to think that a clothing online company that gets 90% of their traffic from social media will see a 90% drop in profitability while every $BECKY in town is getting $1200 checks sitting at home scrolling through Instagram.\n\nIf you take a look at google trends you can see that the website maintained the usual traffic (with a 2 week drop when the lockdown started taking place) and a big spike in May when the $1200 checks started pouring in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2vdkgp1xz8f51.png?width=1103&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0e1830290e28d63a4002d8c8dac2b4090b8533e\n\nA good reference is Capri Holdings (CPRI). They sell luxury clothes (Michael Kors, Versace, etc...) and they popped 11% today after releasing Q2 numbers, despite losing $1.20 a share and sales being down 70%.\n\nIf RVLV has a 50% drop compared to Q2 of last year (very unlikely) they would still have 0.09$ profit per share beating the estimates by 450%, the perfect storm for a short squeeze.\n\nTL;DR: Premium only clothing company with a 40% short interest. Short squeeze incoming. $BECKY never stopped.\n\nPositions: 08/14 18C for $0.70",

I know how y\u2019all blow up stocks like it\u2019s nobody\u2019s business. So I went to the smart man\u2019s Robinhood \u2014 ToS \u2014 where they have futures. They asked me to sign a few agreements and give some personal info idk I didn\u2019t really look into it. But whatever, I think, it\u2019s not available on RH = so no WSBers = so not volatile, obviously. What could go wrong? So I shot my shot and put all my money into corn futures. I wake up this morning and I\u2019m down quite a bit, but no worries, I think, \u201cthis is corn. It literally can\u2019t go tits up. Corn doesn\u2019t even have tits. It\u2019s corn.\u201d With that beautiful logic I\u2019d put my mind at ease and went back to watching my other fantastic positions (shoutout to 8/28 SPY 495c).\n\nSo tonight, I get home from a long day of lying in bed. I roll over and look at investing.com and see corn futures way up. Fuck yeah. Elon Musk? Fuck that, call me Elon Husk cuz I\u2019m about to split my dick 5-1 jerking it to these corn profits. As im sitting there, tons of notifications are going off from ToS, chirping left and right. Autist that I am, all I can hear is the sweet sound of profit. Then all that is replaced as a single, loud honk echoes in my driveway.\n\nI go outside and this huge burly guy steps out of an 18-wheeler. He comes up to me and says, in a tiny squeaky little voice, \u201cis this [my address].\u201d I look back at this mix between Andre the Giant and PeeWee Herman and say yes. He slaps a piece of paper on my chest and then turns away from me and as he\u2019s walking to the back of the truck I see four more approaching. I flip the paper over and it\u2019s just a Print-out of the futures contract I signed. Under settlement type it says physical.\n\nSo now I\u2019m fucking sitting here like a jackass, broke AS FUCK, eating CORN, because I have SIXTEEN FUCKING BUSHELS OF CORN IN MY FUCKING DRIVEWAY and I\u2019ve got no idea what to fucking do with them. I swear to god I didn\u2019t even know how big a bushel was. It\u2019s so fucking big my god. I thought I knew what it was like to see a lot of corn.

        "selftext": "I'll post a much longer DD Sunday Evening / Monday morning with links/sources/etc and my valuation model but I wanted to go ahead and put this out there for anyone who is actually interested in doing their own DD and wants to ask any questions that I can hopefully answer and will include in the Sunday post.  I've been in this since it was at $15, sold off post earnings, got back in at $19 and sold a portion off at $21 and have been holding since then.  \n\n**Positions**:\n\n9/18 $22c\n\n9/18 $15c\n\nI currently value the company, under previously released earnings at $21-$23 low, $24-27 medium, and $28-30 top-end.  They are not and will not be profitable until 2022 and possibly 2023 given their business model and the COVID-19 crisis.  I don't believe that the market cares about their profitability as much as it cares about revenue growth and % of contract renewals.  They have a significant moat that $DBX does not have and a value proposition for large enterprises that Microsoft, Google, and other cloud-based providers cannot provide: multi-platform integration. \n\nThis range is based off of my assumptions on how the overall market is weighting $BOXs value and what we need to be thinking about:\n\n**New Customer acquisition**  \nthey lose money on every new customer (legal/accounting/marketing/training/commission fees)\n\n**Current Customer expansion**  \nCustomer paying for different modules and services that they didn't have before.  They are losing money here but not nearly as much.  Same reasons as new customer acquisition legal/accounting/marketing/training/commission etc. \n\n**Expiring customer renewals**   \nPaying to renew contracts and/or upgrade the amount of users with access - this is where they make most of their money and where they believe profitability will come from long term.  Once they have *enough* of the market (they currently have 80% of Fortune 500 with 91% \n\nThe COVID-19 crisis means they will acquire new customers, current customers are having to integrate more of BOX's product line as they shift from home, and they will continue to increase their retention rate which was **107%** in their last earnings. &lt;----- this is an absolutely ridiculous customer retention rate. I anticipate their renewal rate (which includes increased # of users) will BLOW expectations out of the water.  Prior the COVID crisis companies *did not have a reason* to increase the amount of users with remote access to $BOX.  $BOX provided their customers with *free* user account limit upgrades for a month during the last quarter... What do you think is going to happen with those organizations who were given a free account to work from home?\n\n\\---\n\n**To be clear:**\n\n\\#1 I'm not telling you that $BOX is going to beat earnings (but it will) and then go sky high (it probably won't )  \n\\#2 The money to be made in $BOX is on the earnings run-up.  It will start on Monday / Tuesday morning and run until/after earnings.  If you buy calls on Monday morning it will literally be *free* money if you sell before the actual earnings date.    \n\\#3 all of this is assuming that shit doesnt hit the fan between now and August 26th. \n\n**What happened last earnings?**\n\nIt ran up massively going into earnings ($17 to $19.50 prior to earnings), beat earnings and spiked the next day for 5%.  Institutional holders who held on to the stock since $12-$15 sold off as they re-positioned their funds for June and more/different institutions bought in June leading to the run-up June 11th-June 22nd ($18 to $22). \n\n**Why is it down now?**\n\nOverall market trends, the continual beatdown of small-cap tech stocks specifically in early July as funds once again repositioned themselves into cyclicals and FAANG, and market sympathy with $DBX.  It is currently sitting at the price that it was at BEFORE the last earnings where it ran from $17 - $21 PRIOR to their earnings report being released.  That run started 11 days before earnings.  We are currently 12 days before earnings.   The run-up will once again commence beginning next week.",

        "selftext": "All you autists worried about RKT and will end up paper handing any dips need to wake up. RKT is one of the best deals on the market right now. Here's why:\n\n**RKT will undoubtedly eventually be valued as a Fintech Company.**\n\nWhy? Because it has all the core components of a fintech company. RKT at it's core is a consumer-facing, tech-based mortgage origination platform and it's productivity, Revenue per Employee, and margins are **in line if not better than fintech players**. Let's take a look:\n\n* RKT's Q1 2020 EBITDA Margin was a **blistering 44%!** Compare that other FinTechs latest EBITDA margins \n   * SHOP at negative 1.9%\n   * GWRE at 6%\n   * LMND at negative 73%!\n   * PYPL at 19%\n* RKT has an **Revenue per Employee (as of 3/31/20) figure of $300k**! Again, compare to other Fintechs, RKT is nearly the exact Median\n   * SHOP at $416k / employee\n   * GWRE at $276k / employee\n   * LMND at $251k / employee\n   * PYPL at $828k / employee\n* Now, let's look at the valuation for the other Fintechs. **RKT is very obviously undervalued compared to the segment**\n   * Enterprise Value / Revenue\n      * SHOP - 54.3x LTM Revenue\n      * GWRE - 11.7x LTM Revenue\n      * LMND - 44.3x LTM Revenue\n      * PYPL - 11.4x LTM Revenue\n      * **RKT - 2.2x LTM Revenue**\n   * P/E\n      * SHOP - N/A, negative EPS\n      * GWRE - 333x P/E\n      * LMND - N/A,negative EPS\n      * PYPL - 87x P/E\n      * **RKT - 7.7x P/E**\n\n**But, but, what about the mortgage volume? Isn't RKT exposed to interest rates and mortgage volume?**\n\nPlain and simple, there is no force that is going to stop volume right now. We can all say that fundamentals don't matter and for stock market pricing they may not. But in terms of interest rate action by the Fed, they very much do matter, and it is clear the Fed does not intend to raise rate until fundamentals truly stabilize. And if rates do come up, it will mean even J.Pow &amp; Co think inflation is getting too hot. Fuck SLV gang, **Real Estate is the ultimate anti-inflation safe-haven.** So volume should remain largely unaffected as investors seek inflation protection.\n\n**RKT continues to gain market share in an expanding market**\n\nLet's face it, eventually boomers will not be applying for new mortgages and millennials are not going to walk into Chase with a $100 fountain pen to apply for a mortgage. One of the biggest themes of the housing market today is increasing rate of home ownership among millenials. RKT's completely digitized offering positions them to capitalize on market trends. The numbers prove this as RKT's share of the total mortgage market has increased from 1.3% in 2009 to &gt;9% in the first quarter of 2020, making RKT the **largest mortgage originator in the US.**\n\n**RKT's technology drives faster, better outcomes for end consumer**\n\nRKT's application process can be understood as \"parallel\" vs. the traditional mortgage industry's \"linear\" process. This results in faster approvals and faster closing times. RKT closes loans 25% faster than the industry average - 29 days on average vs. the industry average of 40 days. Not only is this good for the end consumer (instant-gratification millennials), it means RKT's workforce is significantly more efficient than the industry average, closing average of **8.3 loans per month per team member** in YTD 2020 vs. the **industry average of 2.3 per moth per team member**\n\n**In summary, the retail mortgage industry is in desperate need of digitization. RKT is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this need.** After all, who else is going to do this? Penny-fucking-Mac?\n\nTLDR: Go long RKT, I am long shares and will continue to add on dips.",

In some ways I was privileged because I got to work with my dad in factories during an era where manufacturing technology started to change in drastic ways. It inspired me as a young pup which eventually lead me down the road of online mathematics-related education. Lucky for you, this includes game theory and finances.\n\nI write these DD's because I believe I have an enormous advantage in the current climate. I love to distribute knowledge, love the process of learning and I consider it one of my hobbies.\n\nI self-taught myself serverless and cloud computing technologies while I was in school and moved to California to pursue building my dream company in education technology. It also appears that the US is shifting toward increased Mexican trade, which I understand quite closely and have written about before.\n\nI love education and I love teaching - it is my passion. The intent here is to spur imagination and debate on the subject. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # Dropbox as an Education Company\n\n[Compliance is king](https://preview.redd.it/mil0bshb4qe51.png?width=2782&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b42c5173e74ab83bd9cc38b115796a772c6d5b43)\n\nDropbox has a wonderful history introducing the masses to cloud computing applications. It solved a real file problem at the time - Apple and Microsoft files were not intuitive and there was a split in adoption. Academics of various ages needed an elegant solution and that was Dropbox. Think about that; users looked to solve a File Operating System problem using cloud computing in 2007. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDropbox is an education company. The best education technology companies are those that support the flow of education with high quality tooling rather than trying to replace it. Under this framework, I regularly invest in things like Autodesk, Adobe, and Dropbox as the companies have created an environment where IT school administrators will offer Creative Cloud, Autodesk, and Dropbox services under their student email.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are familiar with the American education system, you know that this is an absurdly slow dinosaur when it comes to getting changes in motion. Technology, as a result, has to execute in rather phenomenal way to even have a chance in the education space. This is why you'll see awfully accessible and robust technology exist in the space - Windows, Macs, Chromebooks, Khan Academy, Symbolab, Dropbox, Adobe, Autodesk, Oracle, Blackboard, Canvas, etc. They are convenient tools that pay a lot of attention to things like ADA (disabilities) compliance and the like.\n\nThere is a revolution occurring in education in the form of disabilities pedagogy (the study of how to teach). Unlocking a lot of understanding in children with non-verbal autism, PTSD, and other serious learning challenges is an enormous frontier in teaching, learning, and understanding human development. \\*\\*These technologies do not get in the way and exist to assist.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # Dropbox as a Technical Product\n\nThe File &amp; Storage system in any given operating system will always be critically important to a user and the need will always be larger than you can anticipate. It extends from IT safety, banking, education, supercomputing, and so on. Can you evaluate the amount of storage and data needed after Machine Learning tools have grown for 10 years? It can not be determined, but it can be anticipated. Organizations that have built their own distributed infrastructure are advantaged. One can reasonably assume that these companies will distribute the building blocks to their products. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xu67kf179qe51.png?width=2953&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16a1ce179420a08750c5df246064f6eebdad30cc\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSide note: the CEO is currently in the Board of Directors of Facebook - who is also looking into workspace applications \\*\\*SPECIFICALLY TO SOLVE LONG TERM WORK-FROM-HOME COMMUNICATIONS\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Workplace @ Facebook](https://preview.redd.it/vpcnvvru4qe51.png?width=3382&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46b3f6da6502c53102a73047c4b13977f3d498b1)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Workspace @ Dropbox](https://preview.redd.it/rr462ns25qe51.png?width=1026&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb2ba0e8e4fcc2bc24e82129bd0e209bee2d55d8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is an enormous list of high-quality features that Dropbox offer due to its integration and infrastructure approach across multiple platforms:\n\n* \\- File security\n\n[banned by xi](https://preview.redd.it/mtg94ntd8qe51.png?width=1411&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e62965952b2e9b876860beede13c106b59115f6)\n\n* \\- Signatures\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ewaxdbdl8qe51.png?width=2791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce09ff54bad22b1920a33326478f69e11171a81d\n\n* \\- Computer vision document scanning\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[OCR](https://preview.redd.it/0551mtwz8qe51.png?width=2413&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22ec6a63fe1fe5935dea0d7c743ea4a202f7a393)\n\n* \\- Workspace expectations (file syncing, large file transfers, organization,IT controls)\n* \\- Link generators to leak those sweet unreleased albums through zoom [https://www.dropbox.com/s/36pz554f6ds5eyu/Uzi%20Wheezy%20Zoom.wav.m4a?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/36pz554f6ds5eyu/Uzi%20Wheezy%20Zoom.wav.m4a?dl=0)\n* \\- File embedding \n* \\- Self-built storage infrastructure\n* \\- Deep industry wide integrations ranging from Zoom to Adobe\n* \\- Deep relationships in the education sector\n* \\- An unholy amount of other file solutions\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hicx44ptdqe51.png?width=2547&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc087db00260d31a49e3c33a32020848f9d91e05\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # The Compliance Advantage\n\nCloud computing is no longer a mystery, nor is it an open secret. It's a necessary supply chain tool, demanded, and growing faster than imaginations can keep up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI work in the fintech industry. Let me tell you, compliance is everything. There is no Square, Paypal, Dropbox, Cloudflare, or any of your favorite important apps without various degrees of compliance. It would be much more helpful to view Square as an organization that distributes compliance to it's small businesses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* \\- For Banking it's the Bank Secrecy Act and PATRIOT Act\n* \\- For Education it's FERPA\n* \\- For Healthcare it's HIPAA\n* \\- The list goes on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what does this mean? It's means that mature cloud companies like Cloudflare, Dropbox, and the like are in an excellent positions to \\*\\*satisfy the legal means to continue to grow at scale\\*\\*. This is an extremely important factor to consider in the next 5 years. **Dropbox is not something people \"get\" -  it's something that they're \"given\".** For example, when I signed my name to accept my first career job - I was given Dropbox's HelloSign to do so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Cloud Computing Hierarchy of needs](https://preview.redd.it/s3hfokxg5qe51.png?width=2981&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ff1c87c8db5802df55d7f4156ee9b9f2e4f23c4)\n\n[Compliance advantage in education](https://preview.redd.it/s1qhcdxj5qe51.png?width=3821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34678980f20b163d47ec041add6defae67720038)\n\n[Another example of compliance-focused approaches](https://preview.redd.it/6nhym58n5qe51.png?width=3821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7bc8101854eaa2a29f643f630024be629b23b9de)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # The Monopoly Problem &amp; Integrations Competitors\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1d1vs3oy5qe51.png?width=1835&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81db898c8bd65364d7b2162ede4daecd5455547e\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverybody knows it. Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple is a monopoly cluster on data. Breaking them up is not a complex equation. Much like the death of a drug or religious cartel; there are many other viable candidates eager to steer the wheel in another direction. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is possible to compete against them, as evidence by organizations like Dropbox, Cloudflare, TikTok, Zoom, and the like. These smaller companies combining is what I consider the Unicorn Operating System. There opportunity is by distributing infrastructure to overwhelm larger companies that depend on acquisitions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is already happening.

        "selftext": "Hi all! I am a 29M and still in school pursuing a PhD in the USA. I have no student loans/cc debt etc.  I am living off a stipend, but I manage to put aside $600 each month to invest. I just started investing a couple of months ago and since I am not confident about what I am doing, I opened two brokerage accounts, one with Robinhood and the other with Chase. The Chase account is an \u201caggressive\u201d (meaning approx. 90% stocks) portfolio account, in which the bank handles my entire portfolio and I simply put money in it every month. The RH account is, of course, handled by me. My idea is to continue this for a year or two and ultimately consolidate all my money into one account and close the other one, depending on which performs better. \n\nIn my RH account I have/planning to have the following stocks:\n\n**Technology:** GOOG, AAPL, MSFT, FB, AMZN, BABA, INTC, TSM, QCOM, NVDA\n\n**Finance:**  BAC, JPM, PYPL, BRK.B, V, AXP, C\n\n**Communications:** T, VZ\n\n**Consumer Discretionary:** PG, MCD, WMT, DIS, KO\n\n**Industrial:** BA, LMT, DAL, AER\n\n**Healthcare:** JNJ, UNH\n\nI do not plan to invest in ETFs as of now since I am young and able to take risks. Out of the $600 I am investing each month, $300 goes to my Chase investment account and $300 goes to my RH account. I am planning to DCA by investing an equal amount in each of the stock I own in RH, so I would like to own no more than 30 stocks, preferably 25.\n\nI have two questions:\n\n1) Is my strategy of having an RH account and another investing account with Chase a good one? Or should I just stick to one or the other from the get-go? Will having two investment accounts be an issue when I file my taxes?\n\n2) Does my portfolio look good? Am I well / over-diversified? Am I missing some obvious sectors? I think I might end up with way too many similar companies e.g. INTC, TSM, QCOM, and NVDA which is not really diversification. Maybe I should just pick one out of all such companies?\n\nAny other advice/comments about my portfolio are welcome. TIA!",

        "selftext": "Buying the RKT Dip is an Absolute No-Brainer\n\nAll you autists worried about RKT and will end up paper handing any dips need to wake up. RKT is one of the best deals on the market right now. Here's why:\n\n**RKT will undoubtedly eventually be valued as a Fintech Company.**\n\nWhy? Because it has all the core components of a fintech company. RKT at it's core is a consumer-facing, tech-based mortgage origination platform and it's productivity, Revenue per Employee, and margins are **in line if not better than fintech players**. Let's take a look:\n\n* RKT's Q1 2020 EBITDA Margin was a **blistering 44%!** Compare that other FinTechs latest EBITDA margins \n   * SHOP at negative 1.9%\n   * GWRE at 6%\n   * LMND at negative 73%!\n   * PYPL at 19%\n* RKT has an **Revenue per Employee (as of 3/31/20) figure of $300k**! Again, compare to other Fintechs, RKT is nearly the exact Median\n   * SHOP at $416k / employee\n   * GWRE at $276k / employee\n   * LMND at $251k / employee\n   * PYPL at $828k / employee\n* Now, let's look at the valuation for the other Fintechs. **RKT is very obviously undervalued compared to the segment**\n   * Enterprise Value / Revenue\n      * SHOP - 54.3x LTM Revenue\n      * GWRE - 11.7x LTM Revenue\n      * LMND - 44.3x LTM Revenue\n      * PYPL - 11.4x LTM Revenue\n      * **RKT - 2.2x LTM Revenue**\n   * P/E\n      * SHOP - N/A, negative EPS\n      * GWRE - 333x P/E\n      * LMND - N/A,negative EPS\n      * PYPL - 87x P/E\n      * **RKT - 7.7x P/E**\n\n**But, but, what about the mortgage volume? Isn't RKT exposed to interest rates and mortgage volume?**\n\nPlain and simple, there is no force that is going to stop volume right now. We can all say that fundamentals don't matter and for stock market pricing they may not. But in terms of interest rate action by the Fed, they very much do matter, and it is clear the Fed does not intend to raise rate until fundamentals truly stabilize. And if rates do come up, it will mean even J.Pow &amp; Co think inflation is getting too hot. Fuck SLV gang, **Real Estate is the ultimate anti-inflation safe-haven.** So volume should remain largely unaffected as investors seek inflation protection.\n\n**RKT continues to gain market share in an expanding market**\n\nLet's face it, eventually boomers will not be applying for new mortgages and millennials are not going to walk into Chase with a $100 fountain pen to apply for a mortgage. One of the biggest themes of the housing market today is increasing rate of home ownership among millenials. RKT's completely digitized offering positions them to capitalize on market trends. The numbers prove this as RKT's share of the total mortgage market has increased from 1.3% in 2009 to &gt;9% in the first quarter of 2020, making RKT the **largest mortgage originator in the US.**\n\n**RKT's technology drives faster, better outcomes for end consumer**\n\nRKT's application process can be understood as \"parallel\" vs. the traditional mortgage industry's \"linear\" process. This results in faster approvals and faster closing times. RKT closes loans 25% faster than the industry average - 29 days on average vs. the industry average of 40 days. Not only is this good for the end consumer (instant-gratification millennials), it means RKT's workforce is significantly more efficient than the industry average, closing average of **8.3 loans per month per team member** in YTD 2020 vs. the **industry average of 2.3 per moth per team member**\n\n**In summary, the retail mortgage industry is in desperate need of digitization. RKT is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this need.** After all, who else is going to do this? Penny-fucking-Mac?\n\nTLDR: Go long RKT, I am long shares and will continue to add on dips.",

        "selftext": "Since everyone has been talking about investing in SQ, I thought maybe we could start an open discussion about the risks of Square the business, whether or not we can continue to expect a skyrocketing share price in the years to come.\n\nI'll point out some things I'm iffy about, would like to get feedback on what you all think. Maybe there's things I'm not aware of.\n\n* Competitors. Square has a good product in an explosive growth industry, but I see their products easily replicable by Apple, Google, and PayPal. Should their business prove to have high demand and margins, there's no doubt FAANG giants will follow. Square has a head start, but do they have a competitive advantage? They have lots of commercial business data atm, but I'm doubtful of the value of that in today's market (more on that in my next point). They're beginning to collect consumer data, but imagine how much more data Visa and Mastercard has over them on that. Their technology is easily replicable by other big companies with enough resources to execute.\n* The limitations of the loan business. One of Square's most promising competitive advantages is that they provide loans to small businesses that show promising growth and room for expansion based on their revenue and profit which is logged into the Square system. There is an undeniable market of unserved small business owners that greatly benefit from this feature, but it's doubtful that this would unleash profits that wouldn't hit a low ceiling most of the time. For example, a hair salon can only purchase so many new salon chairs before they run out of customers to serve within that vicinity. Square could strike gold with a really profitable revolutionary small business, but I don't see why those businesses wouldn't be funded by VC's first before coming to Square. Even if they came to Square first, those businesses are one in a million. I do see Square making profits here, but not profits that would take them out of a niche player role.\n* The limitations of commercial business data. With current data limitations, it's impossible for Square's current technology to be an efficient evaluator of which businesses can achieve explosive growth and which ones will never escape low margins. There are too many non-numerical variables in determining a profitable business. Data technology and AI is not there yet.\n* Personal finance inertia. For Square to disrupt the banking industry, they need some clear advantage over banks. Why should we do the extra work of switching over if we are at an established bank? I'm not saying Square wouldn't be a better option than a traditional bank, but it takes a lot to turn the tide in an industry as conservative as the banking industry.\n\nFeel free to refute any of these concerns, maybe there's something really compelling to Square that I'm not seeing. If I'm wrong, I'd love to know.",

        "selftext": "(writing this to remind myself why i do what i do)\n\nThis year my portfolio has been whipsawed from a positive +5% in Feb to a massive swan dive in March and April  (i didn't dare look) and  -14% in May. It  turned positive in a few times in June and July. And now on 7th August, I am back to 02 Jan 2020 nos.\n\nI own 30 stocks, 10 of which comprise of 66% of the total portfolio. The next 20 stocks 15% and the reminder 19% is in Cash. I also didn't trade much, I did 11 trades, 8 of which was in Feb, and only 3 in the last few months.\n\nI started 2020 with 20% in cash, and after T-Mobile completed the transaction with Sprint, I sold it off and maintained cash between 25% and 30%. And now I am keeping around 20% cash in case I need to average down.\n\nThis year all my value stocks didn't do well. My overvalued technology stocks on the other hand, did better than expected. I also broke a rule twice, which is not to invest &gt;10% of my beginning portfolio in any stock. I did it to average down my cost on this two turnaround stocks.\n\nMy performance year to date is 0.8%. I didn't beat the S&amp;P 500 (+2.5%) but I fared better against the Dow (-5%)\n\nI really do not know what is going to happen in the next five months. Some people have suggested this is 1999 all over again ( the S&amp;P took 17 before it reached the August 1999 levels again), some have predicted gloom and doom and more people realize that Covid-19 will get worse before it gets better. \n\nMy strategy will be to employ the \\~ 20% cash onto my existing stocks. The internal debate I have right now is that I have been averaging down on my value stocks, why shouldn't I buy more of my stocks trending upwards  instead ? (To paraphrase Peter Lynch, add to winners instead of losers). I will need to think this deeply on this topic, as the answer isn't that simple as PL invested in fast growing stocks and not turn-arounds or value stocks. I also do not think it is mutually exclusive  to add to both.\n\nI have a long investing horizon.\n\nMy stocks / gain and losses since the beginning (&gt;5 years ago)\n\n    CUSIP\t\t% of portfolio\tGains/Loss \n    \t\t\t\t\n    AMZN\t\t6.39%\t\t628.66%\n    BIP\t\t0.75%\t\t67.40%\n    BPY\t\t0.56%\t\t-40.81%\n    BAM\t\t0.36%\t\t-28.11%\n    BIPC\t\t0.09%\t\t19.58%\n    BRK.B\t\t10.16%\t\t215.86%\n    CDK \t\t0.40%\t\t-21.97%\n    CPB\t\t0.49%\t\t45.21%\n    CMG\t\t1.76%\t\t269.63%\n    CRM\t\t1.03%\t\t173.41%\n    DB \t\t0.50%\t\t-52.43%\n    DIS\t\t2.46%\t\t441.90%\n    FB \t\t10.89%\t\t199.96%\n    GE\t\t10.15%\t\t-25.46%\n    JBT \t\t2.94%\t\t549.53%\n    JCI \t\t0.97%\t\t4.03%\n    JNJ\t\t0.66%\t\t134.35%\n    JPM\t\t1.93%\t\t71.64%\n    LYG\t\t0.76%\t\t-61.42%\n    MAIN\t\t0.31%\t\t-15.20%\n    MCO \t\t2.63%\t\t643.12%\n    MDLZ\t\t0.83%\t\t73.85%\n    MSFT \t\t4.29%\t\t667.34%\n    PYPL \t\t4.75%\t\t627.99%\n    RHHBY\t\t0.75%\t\t52.23%\n    SPOT\t\t0.63%\t\t85.69%\n    UL \t\t1.56%\t\t84.76%\n    WAB\t\t0.05%\t\t42.54%\n    NYSE:WFC-Q\t0.38%\t\t-3.79%\n    LON:LLOY\t11.49%\t\t-30.77%\n    Cash\t\t19.05%\t\t19.05%",

        "selftext": "Microchip is a semiconductor company out of Arizona with a Mkt. Cap of about $26 Billion. They make chips for a bunch of products like Cyber Security, Wireless Products, and Telecommunications. The thing is that they earnings on 08/04 Tuesday after hours. It is very obvious that are going to beat earnings. Why? Because look at the rest of the industry: Qualcomm, Intel, AMD, Qorvo, and IBM have all destroyed earnings. And since Intel just told everyone that they're too retarded to even make potato chips all the smaller time semiconductor competitors are making bank, example: AMD and QCOM. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMicrochip isn't just your run of the mill small back water company. They actually make acquisitions of other chip companies and use their intellectual property to increase the quality and market share of their own chips. Microchip was found in 1989 and has since made 16 acquistions!!! \n\nYou may, for some reason, say that only big boy chip companies are gonna beat earnings. Well if you don't believe me think about the industries that depend on Microchip for their needs: online educational servicing companies, cloud servicing companies, cyber security companies, telecommunications companies, and just software/tech companies in general. What the hell do we already know about these industries from earnings season? We know they absolutely massacred earnings estimates as everything during COVID has gone tech. Yes, the age of actual industry is dead. Now there are only tech companies that get pumped because of sky high demand (looking at you Apple) and Amazon that sells random shit and still has a tech company valuation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh and you know what's awesome because we have all this knowledge? MCHP is expected to post $1.43 EPS on tuesday, but last year on this quarter they posted $1.41 EPS. What a fucking joke, we should expect at least 40-50% growth in that number from COVID induced semiconductor demand. Not to mention, I think MCHP is gaining market share and could be a big player in a few years in the semiconductor industry. \n\nYou might be hesitant because of my last post on $TER, a chip supplier that many people played incorrectly. I say to you, fuck you. I made money on that play because I sold directly at market open after they destroyed earnings like my data said they would. So if you feel even the slightest FOMO look at these charts from last week: QCOM, QRVO, and AMD; and then tell me what you think MCHP (the same industry) will do!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; MCHP $107c 08/07",
