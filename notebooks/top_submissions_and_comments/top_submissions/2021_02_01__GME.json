        "selftext": "Jumped on the $GME bandwagon on Friday, 4 @ \\~316. My 36 hours of day trading has already taught me that no matter how this plays out, I will never YOLO on a bubble ever again.\n\nThe principle seemed straightforward: hedge funds got lazy/greedy, over-shorted their positions, bet against a company that wasn't actually going under, and some astute monkies on reddit caught them and triggered a short squeeze. Even as someone who knows almost nothing about the stock market, the basic premise makes sense. But the devil's in the details, and hype is blinding.\n\nFirst red flag was when I realized [/u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/) did not bet on the short squeeze, he bet on undervalued stock price *over a year ago*. He has also trimmed his position such that no matter what happens in the squeeze, he walks away with 8 figures. So the people screaming \"if he's still in, I'm still in!\" and \"look at those brass balls, if he can lose $5MM in a day then I can hold\" are really living up to the dumb ape meme. He didn't lose $5MM yesterday, he lost $5MM in \\*unrealized gains\\*, there is a \\*huge\\* difference.\n\nSecond red flag was a common sense idea that hedge funds won't go down without a fight, and they have literally billions of dollars and decades of experience. You don't get that without learning how to game the system in complex, subtle ways. So even if they are still heavily shorted (which they might not even be anymore), and even if somehow [r/WSB](https://www.reddit.com/r/WSB/) is holding some kind of meaningful leverage over them, that doesn't rule out the very real possibility they have a dozen ways out of this that people like me have no idea about.\n\nBut even in the off chance that somehow this turns around, and $GME does go \"to the moon,\" that doesn't change the fact that it's bad long-term strategy to bet on bubbles and jump on bandwagons. They almost certainly fail, and if they don't, they only serve to inflate egos that will fall even harder on the next gamble. I'm still holding my shares but I don't expect to see my \\~$1200 ever again. In the off chance I break even or see a profit here, I will count it as dumb luck and use it as seed money to learn how to invest in real long term gains.\n\n**Edit:** holy shit RIP my inbox. No way I can read all that.\n\nWant to clarify a few things. Not financial advice.\n\n**My position:** I knew I was late to the party. I *wanted* to gamble. I knew what I was doing, and (mostly) why I did it. Hindsight showed me it was more based on emotion than I wanted to admit, but still, I'm not surprised by the outcome so far, and I'm totally OK with taking the L and calling it a lesson learned. I don't blame DFV, WSB, or anyone for my choices. I own them, even proudly, because I wanted to step out and take a calculated risk vs. sit on the sidelines out of fear of loss. I'm holding because I already bought my tickets to this ride, want to see this thing play out, and I'm fine with gambling the final $300 on the outside chance things turn around.\n\n**Your positions:** brothers, sisters, nonbinary siblings: **you are not your portfolio**. whether up or down, your value is not based on how big or small an imaginary number is. you are a human being on the bleeding edge of 3.5 BILLION years of evolution, you have more actual success in your past and potential success in your future than you'll ever know. 12 years ago I was a penniless alcoholic literally stealing change from my grandpa to get loaded on 211 Steel Reserve. I hit my bottom, joined AA, and now I'm a network engineer, wife, kids, the whole lot. Anything is possible if you don't give up on yourself. But I know it's not that easy, we all need borrowed self-esteem before we can see the real value inside. So if this $GME gamble hit you hard, please reach out to someone. don't give up. Hell, this bubble isn't even over, it might even turn around! But either way, don't give up.\n\n**Edit2:**\n\nwow, never expected this to go this far. wrote it on my way out the door as a way to cope with the situation. read a ton of replies, probably missed most of them. thanks for all the love and hate and everything inbetween! A few more points:\n\n* Agreed that RH deserves to be held accountable. No question they manipulated this.\n* Agreed it's not over yet. the squeeze could happen. but if it does, **my** main personal takeaway from this experience will stand: I won't speculate on bubbles anymore. This is my position if I lose everything or make $100k.\n* if you posted gains, that's awesome! so glad for you, I wish you the best!\n\n**Edit3 2/3/21:**\n\nFull disclosure, I closed my position this morning at a \\~$900 realized loss.\n\nMy gut says the squeeze happened, short interest isn't what I thought it was on Friday, and the stock will return to actual value soon.",

        "selftext": "*Edit: There's a lot of great responses and info about my questions in the comments! Will try to incorporate that into the post as I go, or make a followup tomorrow!*  \n\n\n  \nFirst off, my position: 1900 shares of GME @ 30, plus 5 calls @ $250. Peak value was nearly 500k.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/96g5d07z45f61.png?width=1007&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e983f8d1a6b56bcf4201d32a56b0c2535886d5b\n\n*This is not financial advice, I'm not an expert, etc*\n\n\\*\\*WHY SHOULD WE STILL HOLD?\\*\\* I know there's a lot of sentiment around solidarity, and sticking it to the man, and 'fuck it, I'm down so much anyway'. NONE OF THESE ARE GOOD REASONS TO HOLD. I'm here to talk about the actual reasons to hold.\n\nHere's our biggest problem: **Misinformation**\n\nThere is a lot of information being spread around like manure. Mostly unread, mostly un-disseminated, basically just a whole bunch of positive sounding claims meant to serve as confirmation bias.\n\nHow do we ensure we're not just buying into bullshit? **By determining exactly what data we have available to make decisions as of right now**. That is what I intend to review (and hopefully gather from you apes) here today.\n\n**A REVIEW OF THE FORCES ACTING ON GME**\n\n1. **Fundamental Value:** This isn't relevant right now. GME is presently a $20/share company, even with Ryan Cohen shooting magic rainbows out of his ass it's not worth more than $60 until they actually start changing their business model. When that happens the value will go up, for now 30% above expected online revenue growth doesn't mean shit in the bigger picture.\n2. **Momentum:** This is the biggest reason we hit $500/share, and the biggest reason we're still at $90, way above fundamental value. Here's something to consider: **Momentum, not the squeeze, is why the share price is where it is -** rather, the growing global awareness of the squeeze provided the evidence needed for everyone to rush to get onboard.  But, people are also idiots. Momentum can change directions quickly from an upward to downward pressure, and can be easily manipulated, as we've seen.\n3. **THE SHORT SQUEEZE:** What actually causes the high short interest to result in raised share prices? Short sellers who are actually (not theoretically) pressured into closing their positions at an overall loss, and en masse. If most of the shorters can wait out or hedge against their losing positions, then there never has to be a mad rush to buy up shares at whatever price. *Do you actually think Melvin Capital was at any point margin called?*  If/when they exited, they did so in an orderly fashion that best served their interest, to the point that they were straight up given a multi-billion dollar bailout by their competitors! These people don't play by the same rules as you, you fucking braindead monkey.\n4. **The Gamma Squeeze:** Last Friday, for the second Friday in a row, a vast majority of calls expired In The Money, and a bunch of call owners were owed shares by today (T+2 rule). The theory behind the gamma squeeze is that call sellers didn't have good risk models and didn't hedge their calls well enough, and so didn't actually  own enough underlying shares to hand over, and now need to rush to buy them at market price. Could that be why there was a massive spike from 80 to 150 this afternoon? Maybe. **But a gamma squeeze can also backfire**. All those people assigned shares may not have the tens of thousands in cash ready to buy, or the margin to borrow. That means all those shares get dumped back on the marketplace.\n5. Straight up motherfuckin dirty illegal manipulationOh, best believe it happened, and is still happening. Just to review the hits:\n   1. DTCC and/or Retail brokers prevent buying, artificially suppressing demand for Thu price drop and locking up people's money till they could transfer elsewhere.\n   2. Sudden increases to margin requirements and severe margin calling\n   3. A massive media campaign to announce shorts closed positions and everyone is in Silver\n   4. Retail brokers cancelling orders, restricting limit prices, enforcing unwanted stop losses (eToro),\n   5. Illegal coordinated short ladder attacks to drive down price and fish for stop losses and paper hands.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**OK, BUT YOU KNEW ABOUT ALL THIS. WHAT'S IMPORTANT NOW IS**\n\n***WHAT EVIDENCE DO WE ACTUALLY HAVE ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF PLAY?***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo, really, I'm asking. Our advantage is in our ability to crowdsource information. I will edit and update this list as information is shared. Meanwhile I'll try to flesh out a framework as best I can.\n\n**Argument #1: The Squeeze is not Squoze because Short Interest is still high**\n\n* Claim: As long as the Short Interest exceeds the Float, there is a supply problem for short sellers. This *may* translate into pressure from lenders on short sellers over time, driving the squeeze.\n* Evidence needed: What is the current short interest?\n   * S3 partners provides estimates using a model, and as of today claim it is only **51% of free float**:Source: [https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356317744300490752](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356317744300490752)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7e4mes1qf5f61.png?width=277&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cfb3da83d0aaaeb2256e11bf7a3e3eaf8b31de90\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Ortex data provides another estimate using another model, and as of yesterday claims it is only 27 mil shares, only a million shares difference from S3Source: [https://www.ortex.com/stocks/26195/shorts](https://www.ortex.com/stocks/26195/shorts)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yo2s5e2cg5f61.png?width=1691&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d83701a452b5aaa079e3a3948cecbbb3feb77b5a\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **REAL DATA:** The SEC releases reported short interest twice a month. The most recent data we have is from Jan 15, and wasn't released to the public until Jan 27.\\*\\*On Jan 15 the SI was 131%.\\*\\*The next report for Jan 31 won't be available until Feb 9.Frankly, we can't rely on the REAL data, because it's delayed too long to be relevant.\n* Evidence needed: What is the actual free float?\n   * I still need help finding this. I know 71 Million shares have been issued overall, but a lot of that is locked up in institutions that would have to report any selloffs within 3 days. If 27 million shorts still need to close, how many shares are readily available?\n   * Yahoo Finance puts Float at 46.89 mil shares, FWIWSource: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/)\n\n**Argument #2: There hasn't been enough trading volume for shorts to possibly close**\n\n* Claim: assuming \\~27 mil shorted, not enough shares exchanged hands since the price blew up to close those positions.\n* Evidence: Someone explain to me how this isn't enough volume for shorts to cover. Mark Cuban said pretty much the same thing in his AMA today.\n\n|Date|Trade Volume|\n|:-|:-|\n|2/2 Tue|77.8m|\n|2/1 Mon|37.3m|\n|1/29 Fri|50.5m|\n|1/28 Thu|58.5m|\n|1/27 Wed|93.3m|\n\n**Argument #3: Short Sellers will are under pressure to close, so the squeeze is coming**\n\n* Claim: Short sellers are bleeding money trying to outlast us with their losing positions, and will eventually prefer (or be forced) to close out the loss rather than be caught in the squeeze.\n* Evidence needed: Shorts are (on average) in a losing position at current share price ($90), and can't just close right now at profit\n* Evidence needed: Any external pressure on shorters to close their position at a loss rather than waiting us out for the price to drop further\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Argument #4: Market manipulation shenanigans didn't work, and retailers didn't sell off en masse, creating the liquidity shorts need to close cheaply.**\n\n* Claim: Price dips happened during low volume trading (short ladder market manipulation etc), and the longs are holding fast.\n* Counterevidence: THE MOTHERFUCKING $300 PRICE DROP YOU DUMB FUCKING NUGGETS\n* Evidence: This popular screenshot of Fidelity's order ratio:Source: [https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5jnmtl00l5f61.png?width=1021&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9e676fbd3e0811f826463f14d4b9c12971ed6b2\n\n* Counterargument: Order counts don't mean shit. For every share traded there is a buyer and a seller. So 100k buyers buy one share each, and 40k sellers sell 3 shares each. Or 20k buyers place 5 buy orders for one share each, and there are less buyers than sellers overall. WHO KNOWS? This strikes me as very insufficient evidence for bullishness, serving only as confirmation bias for bagholders.\n* **Evidence needed:** Something more concrete that better proves that more shareholders held than sold.\n* Evidence needed: other brokerages data on buy vs sell orders. Fidelity is just one broker, and a retail broker at that. Hedgies don't trade with Fidelity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Argument #5: The biggest dips were driven by short-ladder attacks during low volume periods**\n\n* Claim: the decrease in price from 500 to 90 is mostly fueled by artificial suppression of demand and fake selling (short ladders), and not so much by change in momentum.\n* Evidence: At this point its guesswork based on limited evidence provided by redditors. Essentially, round share numbers sold within microseconds at fractional prices\n   * [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la682h/visual\\_representation\\_of\\_a\\_short\\_ladder\\_attack\\_4/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la682h/visual_representation_of_a_short_ladder_attack_4/)\n   * [https://i.redd.it/qoyvz8grr3f61.jpg](https://i.redd.it/qoyvz8grr3f61.jpg)\n* Counterargument: short ladder attacks are straight up not real, conspiracy theory confirmation bias invented by WSB itself: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/latax6/short\\_ladders\\_are\\_not\\_real/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/latax6/short_ladders_are_not_real/)\n* Evidence needed: I've seen but can't find better video evidence showing the stream of rapid trades at fractional prices and round share counts (100 shares at a time), could use that. \\\\\n* Counterargument: The artificially reduced volume from Robin Hood and other brokers limiting access has now been largely removed, as RH allows 100 shares and by now people had time to transfer funds to another broker. Damage to momentum was done, but if there is still a valid thesis it should just mean people can buy the dip, right?\n* Evidence needed: That the price dips over the last 48 hours haven't been accompanied by massive trading volume. I'm seeing a lot, especially compared to Thursday's artificial suppression:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/77a0euotp5f61.png?width=1884&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62b0af04608cb5fb235895d8bbd03b9e19a00588\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Argument #6: 'You are here on the VW short squeeze chart'**\n\n* Claim: See how the famous VW short squeeze also had a massive price drop before it blew up? That's us right now.\n* Evidence: A single, solitary chart\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mx6fs2f5r5f61.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60cc9096c46097b7328c59c2572b3466e5241131\n\n* Counterargument: the VW scenario was not the same as the GME play. VW share liquidity plummeted literally overnight when it was revealed that Porsche had bought up 90% of the float (check me on that fact, I'm repeating secondhand info). See the big dip AFTER the squeeze? How do we know we aren't *there*?\n* Evidence needed: IDK, some kind of coherent explanation of why VW dipped like that, and why a similar dip would be expected in the GME Play\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWill edit with more, my primate fingers are hurting from trying to press the keys and my handler needs to readjust my helmet.",

Weeks where it would lose half. I didn\u2019t sell a share as it went from $960 to $330 pre-split. Nor the $460-$300 drop post-split. These are just a few examples. \n\nI bought GME because in a worst case scenario some crazy illegal shit happens and I now have a long term position in a solid company. I covered my cost basis in tranches on the way up and now I\u2019m holding the remaining 300 shares with house money. If it\u2019s too late for you to do that, take it as a lesson for next time.  What was Melvin\u2019s mistake? No actual hedging. Don\u2019t be a Melvin. . \n\nA good investment requires holding 9/10 times. The overnight million dollar plays are very rare, because they take a higher ratio of luck than confidence. This shit is a lot like dating - your confidence won\u2019t help if you\u2019re making shitty picks, but your good picks will never pan out without confidence. $GME has my confidence- the numbers are in our favor. And so, I hold. And I sleep like a baby at night. I have 300 shares, and I\u2019ve lost a nauseating amount of money the past two days. \n\nBut I don\u2019t give a fuck. \n\nHold, relax, forget about it. We own the stock, we aren\u2019t the ones bleeding interest. As much as the hedges have their cheating, we have nuclear bombs too- one whale, one great piece of news, one exercising of stock options by a certain Ryan Cohen... I could go on. \n\nIt\u2019s not a sure thing, but anyone acting like we\u2019re in dire straits probably didn\u2019t comprehend what was going on in the first place. Just shut the fuck up and hold. Do you want to be the \u201cGolly I could\u2019ve had Apple 20 years ago!\u201d guy for the rest of your life, or do you wanna be the strong motherfucker who actually took the leap?",

        "selftext": "First of all, I can't wait to be berated in the comments. \n\nI'm gonna be blunt, I have seen a whole lot of dumb shit over the last week.  A lot more than normal.  And compounding all of that is an unprecedented amount of legitimate emotional involvement here.  So let me get started by saying outright that people getting emotionally involved with trading stocks always lose.  Short, long, whatever.  It doesn't matter if you're a 19 year old throwing in your life savings or Bill fucking Ackman not being able to admit he was wrong with Herbalife.  Letting your emotions be a major factor in trading is a fantastic way to lose money. \n\nAnd a whole lot of you are really emotionally involved with this GME, AMC, whatever.\n\nTo the point: I am not making a buy/sell/hold/whatever recommendation.  I have no special insight in to what's happening with GME or whatever else.  What I can tell you is that it is for sure not worth $300.\n\nSo let's dispel one quick thing: this is not David vs Goliath.  It also isn't the little man vs hedge funds or WSB vs big finance.  It might have started out that way, but if you only read one thing [read this](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-29/reddit-traders-on-robinhood-are-on-both-sides-of-gamestop): \n\n&gt;Many of the big retail brokerages, including Robinhood, route a lot of their customer orders to Citadel Securities, so it ends up seeing a large percentage of retail trades in U.S. stocks. It can see if retail traders are mostly buying or mostly selling or mostly pretty balanced. You might expect\u2014I certainly expected\u2014to see that retail traders were buying more than they were selling this week. The stock seemed to be rocketing up on frenzied retail sentiment, and the posters on WallStreetBets were all claiming that they would never sell and keep buying until it hit $1,000.\n\n&gt;But here\u2019s what Citadel Securities\u2019 retail flow looked like in GameStop this week: 1\n\n&gt;[Graphic here](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i9SnRzR8AM1c/v0/800x-1.png)\n\n\n&gt;Retail investors were net buyers on Monday but net sellers for the rest of the week (through yesterday), and all in all quite balanced: About 49.8% of retail orders (that Citadel Securities saw) were to buy, and 50.2% were to sell.\n\n&gt;What do you make of that? One reading would be: \u201cRetail investors on Reddit might have started the GameStop rally, but they\u2019re not piling into this stock now, and the price action this week is coming from professionals.\u201d Or as one Twitter user put it, \u201cpast the retail ignition, the rocket ship was mostly intra-fast money warfare.\u201d\n\n\n\nSo, just to be clear about this, there is massive institutional money on both sides of this trade, and retail is a toddler sitting at the world series of poker.  \n\n**Understand that melvin does not need to cover in the way a retail trader needs to cover**.  \nYou, and everyone else, have no idea what Melvin's position looks like, and they can reorganize and exit a position before you ever knew it happened.  You don't know how hedged they are, you don't know what their collateral looks like, and you don't know if they've covered and restructured a short at last week's prices.  You simply don't know.  You only know what's been presented in the news, which is almost certainly bullshit.  \n\nThis thing could come to an end as fast as it started and you won't know what happened for weeks.  You might go take a shit at 1pm today and come back to GME trading at $16 because Ken Griffin got on CNBC and announced they restructured their short at an average price of $200, and were happy to sit on it.  Make no mistake, you'll get kicked in the nuts and have your ball taken away faster than you can comprehend.    \n\n**Emotions**\nThe problem with this whole \"strike back at wall street\" narrative is that lots of you are getting really worked up over this trade.  Losing money sucks, but losing money and feeling like you got shit on by the big guy is going to hurt.  This isn't a moral crusade to them, it's 25 billion dollars.  So if you're out here putting money and emotions on the line that you can't afford to lose there won't be a happy ending. \n\nWant to fight the good fight against wall street? Write your congressman, Tweet AOC or Ted Cruz, get you a fucking picket sign and go wave it around on the streeet.  But dropping money on GME that you need in life ain't gonna change anything except your net worth.\n\nTLDR: \n\n1) know and understand who is playing this game.  And that they have access to tools, leverage, and markets that you do not.  You're playing Le Chiffre at Casino Royale right now, you might think you're James Bond but there's a good chance that you're just the fat dude in the corner. \n\n2) Short squeezes end fast.  As fast as they started.  If you're new to trading then understand buying GME at this price can mean all of your money will evaporate before you had time to make a TikTock about it.\n\n3) Get your emotions out of play here.  This whole nonsense political narrative is only going to cause you to make trading mistakes.  Can't handle that?  then maybe it's not a good idea to sit at this table.  \n\nLastly, if you really just can't get yourself out of the whole \"fight the hedge funds\" nonsense, at least understand that you're spending money that you likely won't get back.  If that's worth it to you then have at it.  But don't fool yourself  in to thinking otherwise.\n\n**E: Completely unrelated**: I hate reddit awards, reddit doesn't need your money.  Go buy like a hundredth of a share of VTI or something.",

They cannot cover anywhere near this price level because the shares don't exist. Manipulating the number of shares also dilutes the reported short float.

It's always been about GME.\n\nWhen it comes time for them to pay up, expect the price to drop first.\n\n:edit 3: The price is now around where the volume dropped off. I think we're at the bottom, as long as we hold. I think the chance of seeing big upword moves is as high as its ever been. Unless they want us to sit here for a day. It's all very expensive psychology for them.",

        "selftext": "Here is what I think happened today. \n\nLooking at the options chain, 25k $50 call options expiring this Friday were purchased today. Assuming that the delta was .5, that is 1.25 million shares that was bought to gamma hedge. Then the price of the GME stocks started to rise causing a chain reaction in MMs covering.\n\nIf you look at the $60 call options, 23k were purchased and assuming that the delta on that was .5, that\u2019s another 1.15 million shares that were purchased to hedge. \n\nAnother 17-18k options were purchased between $51-$59, which means around another million shares were purchased during the run up. \n\nThis is entirely assuming that delta on those were .5. If the Delta was higher = more shares were bought.\n\nWe\u2019ve had this shit happen before last month. \n\nSo get ready. If this is a gamma squeeze part II, the fall will be just as fast as the moon. \n\nBut I\u2019m just an ordinary dude (not an expert or a specialist in this field).

You're content.\n\nYou sold your GME shares at small loss at the start of the week as you continued to watch the share price plummet due to market manipulation. You got out, you survived. \n\nIt's 9:28am, you're returning from the school run. Your BMW 1 series seats make you feel safe and important. Your house, although small, is affordable and the mortgage repayments don't put too much pressure on your paper wallet. \n\n\nYour phone goes off as you enter the house. You sit on the sofa and turn on NBC as you open Whatsapp. You have 17 unread messages. \n\n\nYour eyes pan up, the news anchor is shouting. You read the title at the bottom of the screen - 'The Short Squeeze Is Happening\". Jim Cramer is crying. You quickly open your Whatsapp group chat and only see dollar signs being spammed by your friends. You open Yahoo Finance and see the share price at 600.87, it's still rising. Your heart skips a beat. You open I-phone calculator and work out that your 17 shares would now be worth just over 10,000 US dollars. You feel sick.\n\n\nThe share price is still rising. You receive a call from your best friend Mickey, he's crying too. He's telling you about how you were right and he'll be able to pay off his student loan soon. Also his wife is pregnant. You congratulate him with a fickle grin and fake laugh. You look back down at your phone, 828.16. 830.00, 838.26. \n\nWallStreetBets has crashed due to the traffic. \n\n\nYou realise everything you stood for is coming true, but you paper handed too soon. \n\nYou ignored the threads, the experts. You ignored DeepFuckingValue. \n\nYou ignored your god given right to a better life for you and your wifes boyfriend. \n\n\nYou try to buy back in, but you have no money. You begin to laugh, and laugh. Despair and anguish turn into humour. \n\n\nYou pull the Glock from your $16 AliExpress safe and load it. You hold it to your head, you shiver. \n\n\nYou don't pull the trigger. Your paper hands can't do it, and never will be able to do anything of any meaningful value. You drop the gun and admit defeat. \n\n\nAs the camera pans out of your window and over your neighborhood, we see Wall St burning in flames in the distance. The transfer of wealth begins, fade to black.\n\n\n\nEDIT: DON'T BE THAT GUY \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e",

        "selftext": " \n\n&gt;Oh my god! GME is down to $150! It's down to $100! It's down to 30 cents! The hedgies are going to cover all their shorts at that 30cent price point! It's over!\n\nWrong.\n\nNo one is selling at these prices. Sure, maybe a few scared folk who don't know any better. Maybe they trigger a few stop losses. Maybe some margins get called. But it's not enough. Say it with me:\n\n*PRICE DOESN'T MATTER*\n\n&gt;WHAT?!\n\nYou heard me. 30cent GME? No problem.\n\nThey don't need a low price, they need your shares. If 10 people sell at 30c cents, and that's the only market activity, it's a \"30 cent stock\" but Melvin only netted ten shares. They are still fucked. *They aren't buying 50 million shares at 30c, nor $100, nor $300, and that's their problem.* It's an availability issue. Sometimes it's ALSO a price issue (too high for them) but primarily it's the availability.\n\nAll the activity driving down the listed share price are *illegal ladder attacks* (not that legality should be expected at this point, these folk are crooks). Those aren't actual sales though, it's just shares trading hands from hedgie to hedgie. They aren't gobbling up value. These people don't admit defeat, they are neither smart nor humble, they are crooks. They need 50 million+ shares. They need over 100% of the float to sell to them (that 50% float you hear about is accounting shennaigans, ignore it, they are still exposed). *You can NOT close that many positions sniping a few shaky handed noobs.* We aren't talking about a few shares they need to buy, we're talking about fucking ALL OF THEM.\n\nI'll explain that in a second, but first let me repeat:\n\n*PRICE DOESN'T MATTER*\n\nSo let's say you want to buy 50 million shares, let's look at what shares are being asked for in my hypothetical example market:\n\n**# of Shares - Price**\n\nx 20 - $0.30c\n\nx 80 - $5\n\nx 400 - $20\n\nx 600 - $40\n\nx 900 - $60\n\nx 2,000 - $100\n\nx 5,000 - $150\n\nx 10,000 - $200\n\nx 30,000 - $300\n\nx 50,000 - $400\n\nx 150,000 - $500\n\nx 1 mil - $1,000\n\nx 15 mil - $5,000\n\nx 30 mil - $69,420\n\nGet it? There are only a few people willing to sell at those low prices. By the time you've bought a quarter million shares (0.5% of what you need to buy) you're back up to the sustained highs. And these are just exaggerations to make a point. *A stock price only reflects current trade values, not availability at those prices*. If the hedgies are trading their shares back and forth to each other to drive down the price and they have ladder attacked down to a Nickel, that doesn't mean anyone's shares are only worth pocket change, that just means that that is what things are trading at in the moment. There's no volume to buy up at those costs. No one can force you to sell at a Nickel.\n\nGet it?\n\n*PRICE DOESN'T MATTER*\n\nThey need our shares, not a low price. The price does not reflect whether we are 'winning' or not. Their financial reserves indicate that, but there isn't a ticker for that. But be sure, every day the inevitable closes in. Sell out of fear if you like, but you'll just miss out in the end. People like me, as we shore up more funds, snipe these low prices, stealing away shares the hedgies use to ladder and taking shares away from shaky hands and putting them into steady ones.\n\nThis isn't financial advice, I just want to make sure people on this sub have the knowledge to not make fools of themselves in casual conversation.",

        "selftext": "**I have no position in GME**. I've been a member of this sub for a long time. I know this post is going to get downvoted, but I've got to make it because I am very concerned that we could have a wave of self harm urges depending on the way GME moves.\n\nPlease. For the love of everything... be careful. Control your risk. Control the size of your positions and what you're willing to lose. I am seeing posts about people throwing in a million at levels above 200 or 250. Saying that it's everything they've made in the past few years, or maybe it's margin, or maybe it's their ira or savings.\n\nEventually this has to come down. Every single spike like this has. Nothing moves from 20 to 470 in a few days and stays there. Going to 1000? Because Volkswagen did? There's no reason to believe that it will and if it does, that candle wick top could be a small amount of shares. Please, PLEASE... just don't trade more than you can lose. I really am hoping with every fiber of my being that this thing shatters the moon and goes to mars for all of you. \n\nOnce the collapse starts the order book could quickly evaporate. You could become trapped very easily and if you're anywhere above 100$ a share the odds of it coming back are extremely slim should this follow Volkswagen. They stayed under 30 for a decade once it was over. And it did end, and fast.\n\nWhen things are extremely euphoric it's incredibly difficult to tell where you are at in the process. I don't know what's going to happen. What I do know, is that there's going to be some of us in bad shape, for one reason or the other.\n\nI've been a trader for years. I've been a member here for quite a long time. I am making this post not to tell you what to do, but to recommend you manage what you do right now.\n\nSome people are betting such large amounts so high up that they could find themselves in a mental break if they have bad luck. These kinds of movements are super exciting, but getting trapped with a large amount or margin amount high up on a flimsy spike can lead to self harm.\n\nWhich is why I want to urge you to use the hotline. If you're in a very bad place right now, please, use the hotline. Please don't use a permanent solution.\n\nI love all of you guys. I love the memes you make. This part of the internet has been my favorite place for a long time. And I want all of us to keep making memes and having fun. Please be safe.",

        "selftext": "Dear SEC and President Biden,\n\nI am calling on you today, pursuant to 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 78i, titled Manipulation of Security Prices, to prohibit manipulative and deceptive tactics that artificially depresses the price of GME and AMC securities in contravention of the laws of the United States. \n\nSection 78i(a) clearly states that \"It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of any facility of any national securities exchange, or for any member  of a national securities exchange -- **(2)**  To effect, alone or with 1 or more other persons, *a series of transactions* in any security registered on a national securities  exchange, any security not so registered, or *in connection with any security-based swap or security-based swap agreement* with respect to such security creating actual or apparent active trading in such  security, or **raising or depressing the price of such security, for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others.\"**\n\nCurrently, GME and AMC stock prices are actively being manipulated using a mechanism called \"short ladder attacks\" to depress the price of these stocks in contravention of 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 78i. \"Short ladder attacks\" occur when large institutions in possession of the aforementioned stocks sell them for just less than market value in rapid succession between one another in order to drive the price down. The fact that short ladder attacks exist is apparent from on-going market activity that can be seen here\n\n https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la682h/visual_representation_of_a_short_ladder_attack_4/ \n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/d33d2d9346092b3c041c54fc394225c3.png\n\n(Check this from the huge dip last Thursday. No volume but still an enormous dip in price)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nmiqx27md4e61.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3e61c081b3332670eaa8b972c309c6d56177e33\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l71yxn/ladder_selling_explained/\n\ncheck this out\n\nSuch blatant attacks readily establishes prima facie case of market manipulation and must be investigated by the SEC immediately. Further silence from the SEC on this matter, which can be investigated quite quickly, not only encourages further market manipulation but also further diminishes public trust and faith in the U.S. Government.\n\nFinally, section 78i(f) makes it clear that \"Any person who willfully participates in any act or transaction in  violation of subsections (a), (b), or (c) of this section, **shall** be liable to any person who shall purchase or sell any security at a price  which was affected by such act or transaction.\"  \n\n\nI am calling on you to do your job. The direct manipulation of GME and AMC stock prices is an on-going crisis that directly hurts the public interest and is AGAINST THE LAW. You must act now before it is too late.\n\nSincerely,\n\nYour Average Retail Investor\n\nEdit: Feel free to copy, share, do whatever with this. I really don\u2019t care. My work is worthless unless something is actually done to stop this. Also, thank your for the awards \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\nEdit 2: if you want to copy this, go ahead, if you\u2019re having trouble, dm me and I\u2019ll send it to you directly\n\nEdit 3: There was a suggestion to post this on Twitter. Whoever wants to can go ahead or dm me if you need to make it smaller. \ud83d\ude4f\n\nEdit 4: So, I have sent this to the SEC, but I expect nothing more than a form letter, which is basically a garbage non-answer (Google it). I\u2019d rather this get some media coverage so feel free to spam this on Twitter or w/e. No credit necessary",

        "selftext": " **Disclaimer:** This is not financial advice, and much of this information is not my own, sourced from other DD\u2019s, many that have been removed.\n\nAs many of you know, on the 17th of this month, Interactive Brokers Chairman Thomas Peterffy had a CNBC interview (Automod won't let me link it?) where he goes on to explain the fundamentals of the short squeeze. \n\n*However, this whole ordeal might be a whole lot bigger than we had ever imagined.*\n\nTom (or should we go with Tommy?) goes on to illustrate the idea that they had to regulate the stock, as if they had not it would have caused a collapse of the entire market. While Tom might very well be simply lying to us to give an excuse, let\u2019s play his game, and ponder this idea for a second.\n\nTom states without the regulation, brokers would have been obligated to deliver **270 million shares**, while only **50 million shares existed**. *540% of shares*.\n\nVlad, CEO of RobinHood, also told us that on the day of the halt they had an **order volume of 3 Billion**, that they could not fulfill. \n\nTom continues the interview, **admitting** that without the regulation, GameStop stock would have surged into the ***thousands***, yes plural. \n\n*Maybe the reason all of this has truly become such a battle, is because of how seriously scared the other side of the trade really is.*\n\nFinra\u2019s latest short interest update gives us a value of 78.46%. However, there are many reasons why this could be falsely construed. For one, Finra had announced new ways of calculating short interest, letting the synthetic longs drive this down. Another reason this may be low is this data is not fully up-to-date and does not take into account the fall from 100 to where we are now. \n\nSo, what is the true short interest then?\n\nWell, let\u2019s take breakdown GME share ownership alongside the findings of u/Corrode1024:\n\nInsider Ownership: 23,704,787\n\nInstitutions: 151,000,000\n\nFunds: 40,000,000\n\nRetail: 38,595,000\n\nTotal Owned: 253,299,787\n\nTotal Outstanding: 69,746,960\n\nPercentage of ownership to outstanding: 363.17%\n\nEstimated Synthetic Shares: 183,552,827\n\nFINRA Short % of Float: 78.46%\n\nFinviz Float: 50,650,000\n\nReported Shares Shorted: 35,538,624\n\nTotal Estimated Short (Synthetic + Reported)\n\n219,091,451\n\nPercentage of Shorts to the Float: 432.56%\n\nIf you would like a deeper breakdown of u/Corrode1024\u2019s data, check out his DD.\n\n***But yes, the short interest may be a whopping \\~432.56%.*** \n\nLast week, u/thabat ran an AI-generated model of GME\u2019s stock price, which predicts a squeeze target of an extreme ***$130k a share.***\n\nNow, I know, lol. Let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves. That is a completely crazy fucking number. I mean, right? It has to be?\n\nBut I mean, if this whole thing really is bigger than we thought, and it really could cause an entire collapse of the markets. This could be one of the biggest exchanges of wealth in the history of the world. \n\nIf SI really is \\~400%, shorts covering at infinitely higher and higher prices certainly could drive it up to astronomical heights. \n\n*Processing img 1xlj4jhdcji61...*\n\nIf this is what *our* models show, imagine the models and algorithms these big firms have. This may very well be why they are so frightened. They have dug themselves into a hole below bedrock. \n\nAll of this seems to line up with what Vlad and Tom have now told us. Without regulation, this squeeze will be the Mother of all Short Squeezes.\n\nSo now, alongside our Dogfather Cohen, we shall wait patiently for a catalyst. Just like on the last squeeze to $483, we required a catalyst to get us there. Don\u2019t forget the information we knew in November and December. Board spots are opening up in July which Cohen will take advantage of, Cohen could up his stake. Earnings in March. Who knows what could happen.\n\nIt is important to remember the gaming industry is the largest industry in the world, and we are still in its infancy. Older generations continue to laugh down the importance of gaming, but as our generation grows up gaming is only going to evolve and get bigger. GameStop is the only retailer dedicated to gaming and has a surplus of centers that big competitors like Amazon do not. \n\nWe are basically right back where we were in November/December. *The stock price does not matter.* If short interest is at 400%, or if short interest is at 80%. Both are insanely high SI values, and a squeeze is inevitable, one that sends us to 500 or one that sends us to 50,000. With high short interest, a squeeze is inevitable. NEVER forget that.\n\nSo, continue to hold fellow apes. May your hands turn to diamonds and your balls to steel. \n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c",

WHAT YOU ARE TRULY BETTING ON IS OTHER PEOPLE. I WONT TRY TO CONVINCE YOU WHAT TO DO WITH YOUR MONEY. THIS IS MY SPECULATION, MY OPINION  AND IT VERY WELL COULD BE WRONG**\n\nHello all, \n\nI wanted to post last night as many of you commenters have asked for however my building lost power and it was absolutely awful. I am currently a refuge and my ladies house and wanted to get this out to the world.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, but more importantly this is all simply speculation. If anyone wants to make counter claims they are more than welcome but word of advice to all readers. If anyone is claiming that they know exactly what is going to happen...they are lying. There simply isn't enough current data to push this either direction. I am a bull, big time and I would like to explain why.\n\n**First let's talk about yesterday**\n\nThere are a lot of claims of short ladder attacks and the counter-claim is that it was MM's moving the price down. One thing appears certain, there is some sort of manipulation happening in an attempt to drive the price down. Whether this is MM's, HF's, or simply retail shorts and bears; there are a strange number of exchanges happening in a clear effort to lower the price. You can check out the real time quotes [here](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/latest-real-time-trades).\n\nAnother large thought about why the price should have gone **up** yesterday was because of the options thats expired Friday 1/29 ITM. The rule is T+2 meaning these individuals have two business days to cover. Well, we expected a surge of these individuals covering and it simply never came. Everyone was glued to the screen Friday ATH waiting to see the spike of covering...but it never happened. Monday again...never happened. Tuesday...oh boy this is their last day they have to cover! Yet...they didn't. So what does this mean? Well, I see two possibilities.\n\n1. They somehow timed it perfectly and covered throughout the dips and spikes\n2. They haven't covered yet\n\nI'm in the camp of number 2 hence why I am a bull. If they didn't cover that results in a Failure to Deliver which you can learn about [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/failuretodeliver.asp). So what does this mean for us? Well, that would explain the tremendous price drop as FTD's create \"phantom shares\" a problem GME is already facing. This will dilute the price tremendously and the amount of FTD's that probably occurred would greatly dilute the price. \"With\u00a0[forward contracts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forwardcontract.asp), a party with a short position's failure to deliver can cause significant problems for the party with the [long position](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp). This\u00a0difficulty\u00a0happens because these contracts often involve substantial volumes of assets that are pertinent to the long position's business operations.\" From the earlier mentioned website regarding FTD's.\n\nNow this is truly fascinating. The 2008 crisis was largely in part due to a mass number of FTD's. In fact, FTD's sometime intentionally happen...just to drive the price down for FUD so they can then cover at a better price. \n\nSo if this is correct, what happens next? Well, either you can [read about it here](https://financialreview.poole.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Fails-to-deliver_before_and_after_the_implementation_of_Rule_203_and_Rule_204.pdf). Simply put, the individual has to close out the positions after 13 consecutive settlement days of FTD. So all this logic about T+2 was actually just the logic to begin the FTD countdown, if it hasn't already started at the beginning of this.\n\nNow, I'm not saying \"nobody sold\" of course people did. But volume is key and the interest in buying outweighed the interest in selling 3-1 Monday and Tuesday. Of course trades are 1-1 but interest was on the buyer side. \n\nObviously, I don't even need to mention it but restricted trading really is what screwed this thing to begin with. My opinion? It wasn't to prevent a massive short squeeze, it was to buy them time.\n\n**Today**\n\nSo why the hell did it spike this morning? Two reasons.\n\n1. RH still has 100 shares limit on GME, now for those who don't realize, that doesn't mean that is 100 shares per day. No no. The restriction is you can own up to 100 shares of GME. If you already own over 100 shares that's fine, but anyone with less than 100 shares can only add up to that amount. This restriction has not changed and other companies such as Revolut are still imposing a 100% trading restriction on GME. So what did RH offer today? The ability to purchase fractional shares, which doesn't help a whole lot but the fact that buying pressure accelerated at the notion of fractional shares shows that there is still an immense amount of buyers out there.\n2. GameStop [adds new CTO to the roster, an ex AWS lead engineer.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/02/03/2169124/0/en/GameStop-Appoints-Chief-Technology-Officer.html) They added other executive positions as well. This further cements the change the company is taking.\n\nNow, before I get into the rest I want to address something: the fundamentals.\n\nThere is a disturbing echo chamber around the idea that GameStop is a dying brick and mortar retailer and there is no chance at survival. That is simply not the case. I don't want to do a full GME DD here because this is about the second incoming squeeze. However, let me put it to you this way:\n\nIf you were told that a new company was IPO'ing and it was coming to the market with an infrastructure, new talented team, 50 million customers and their plan was to become an e-commerce company to compete with Amazon; their plans for the physical locations was to be game-centric, a place for e-sports to compete, desktop building kiosks, and the newest systems and physical copies of games for those who still love having a physical copy. Not just that, but this company already has revenue share deals with Microsoft and other bigwig companies.\n\nKnowing all that information would you be interested in this company? My answer is an easy yes. The thing with digital transformation and companies changing direction is people get so lost in what the company used to be they can't see what the company is planning on becoming. If this was a brand new company that Ryan Cohen was leading with the same exact model people would be all over the concept. \n\nEnough of that. Let's talking about what is still going on today which is truly fascinating. \n\nSo the good news created a large uptick follow by a combination of people escaping with whatever gains they could salvage and some more clear manipulation regardless of the source. But then what? Well, after the bounce down a lot of people saw this as a fantastic buying opportunity which made it recover quickly...but then something interesting started happening. It started uptrending. Slowly. Steadily. Uptrending. Lower lows, higher highs; no sight more beautiful. \n\nMy interpretation? We found the bottom of the bears attack. The news has been consistently saying the squeeze is over but one and at time they are saying their might be a second surge and their reasoning is if retailors see this price drop as a buying opportunity instead of red flags, it will surely send the price up. The logic there is simple: if people are buying stock it goes up, if people are selling, it goes down. \n\nSo today is pure magic. It doesn't need to be a wild swing up to be promising. What it needs to be is slow, consistent buying pressure even during restricted trading. \n\nBut all the shorts covered! Simply not true. That is a fact. All we know is what people are telling us. Melvin says they covered. It will be the third time they have claimed that. Do I think they covered? Yes, I do. Does that matter? No. Now even if Melvin and others covered and the S3 figures are right that means the guess right now is that this stock is still 57% short. Based on their Twitter this isn't including newly opened positions which anyone in their right mind would certainly open a short position when it was 3-400. They thought this bubble would pop and they would make a quick buck. They saw it get down to $85 and started celebrating...but it starting climbing...uh oh.\n\nTruth is, no one will know the real numbers until the 9th. I think it's a little too much tin foil hat to says those numbers will be misconstrued but what we have witnessed over the past few days...it's possible. \n\nSo let's talk about who is currently holding GameStop. Well, a shit ton of degenerates that have lost millions of dollars and seemingly don't give a shit. They are here out of principle, truth be told, so am I. I absolutely refuse to give any shares to the shorts after the crap they pulled last week. So we have a ton of bag holders refusing to sell and a ton of people wondering if now is the time to get in for a potential epic second short squeeze. No one is going to sell at these levels. Some people here and there but it simply isn't worth it, not with so much potential for a second squeeze.\n\n**So when will this second squeeze happen?**\n\nIf the newest shorts are smart, it already begun. If I took up a short position and saw this start climbing again after everything it has been through, you better believe I would be covering now while I have profits. Not all of them are going to do this, which is why as the price gradually rises the potential for a larger and larger squeeze is exponential. There is no telling when it will happen. It could be a slow climb for the next couple of weeks before it pops. The 9th will be a huge indicator of what is to come, if that has anywhere above 50% short interest you better believe everyone is going to hop right back into it. It could happen as early as this week. It could be post earnings when Papa Cohen tells us his majestic plans during ER. It could be that ER will actually be fantastic on 03/05 because it will have the console cycle numbers. Look at GME charts in the past, the console cycle always makes the stock pop and with all this attention that very well could be the catalyst.\n\n**In summary**\n\nI wanted to do deeper analysis for you all but I knew some of you were really looking forward to the next post and my thoughts regarding the situation so I wanted to get something out there. In my opinion, a second surge, a second squeeze is bound to happen. This is a buying opportunity for those who missed the first one and I think the market and stock price is reflecting that sentiment. \n\nPositions:\n\n1100 GME @ $16 closed\n\n500 GME @ $20 closed\n\n50 GME @ $120 open\n\n236 GME @ $250 open\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** I have yet to see any indication or good thesis to explain why the short squeeze would be over. Even if Melvin covered and even if S3 numbers are correct at a 57% short, these are indicators of another squeeze, potentially even more epic. The bleeding days of red on Monday and Tuesday I personally think was a combination of panic selling when premarket and ATH didn't blow up due to the ITM calls and phantom shares being created due to consistent FTD's diluting the share price. I do think these FTD's were intentional and what many are perceiving as a short ladder attack is in fact the creation and purchasing of phantom shares driving the price down. If you are a bagholder, I think it wise to hold, if you have already closed your position I would consider what we are witnessing as another buying opportunity.\n\nFinal disclaimer. I have already made a significant sum of money on this GME play. This post is not a hope that you will come rescue me from my bagholding status. The money I put back in was money I was willing to lose and I came back in out of principle to stick it to the man. Good luck everyone and be grateful to be alive during this time, this will go down in financial history quite possibly forever. Retail investors have more power than we think.",

        "selftext": "If you are panicking go to your shitty robinhood app and change it from a line chart to a candle chart, the top will show you a volume. The total since 9:30 is less than 2 million. Think logically, if this was a true panic sell do you really think the volume would be 2 million. There is 7.9 million retards in here. If we all panicked the volume would go through the roof.\n\nThis is another attack by hedge funds to force a sell-off and is absolutely meaningless since no retail investors are selling.\n\nBUY THE FUCKING DIP. WE CAN REMAIN RETARDED LONGER THAN THEY REMAIN SOLVENT\n\nEDIT: I believe Robinhood does not even report volume properly on their charts. Anyone who was saying the volume on the day is 15 million or whatever is correct and I should have thought to check a better platform before making this post. However, there is no denying that this is just another ladder attack that will prove to be ineffective as anything under 250 is a fucking discount. To put into perspective the last attack which was on Thursday\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/maag0q5c3we61.png?width=1184&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0302ea7034ae5a714dcd07cd4a82ea6c7c95bb92\n\nNotice the huge red dildo staring at your face. Now look at the bar under that dildo, that is the volume. Is that move remotely justified by that little volume? Look at the previous days where there was massive amount of buying going on, volume was 4x on those days compared to Thursday and yet those candle sizes do not even compare.\n\nTo make this more understandable look at the retard on your left and then look at the retard on your right.

This was an idea already thrown out there, but if the mods could use twitter (and by pinning a statement on this subreddit) to invalidate the silver BS... That would be SUCH a great fucking move. Maybe a message like **\"There is no sentiment among WSB members to buy SLV stock and the little that exists is under scrutiny of WSB members\"**. That would just slam the door on any sources propagating that false information and call them out on their BS (because it's just so obviously untrue). It would also make it clear for those checking the credibility of this fake news that the silver hype is a fabrication by variables outside of WSB and inform them of how convenient it is for hedge funds if people pulled from GME, and supported a stock they own massive shares of.\n\nThis goes without saying that I'm holding GME till the very end. Given how the media and some brokerages have gotten involved (and in a not so subtle way that benefits the hedge funds), it's not even about the money anymore. And that's coming from someone with student loans who stands to profit by exiting right now.

It becomes easier and easier to move the needle with less money.

The main problem is that retail investors, unlike huge firms, can't vacuum up all the supply fast enough, which enables the hf to slowly wiggle their way out buying up paper hands. They've likely exited their worst short positions and reshorted at a better price.\n\nSome people are saying the squeeze might be more of a slow gradual upward pressure, rather than a sudden event. The truth is that the hedge funds are walking on a tightrope, and this stock is still extremely volatile.

Short sales normally are settled by the delivery of a security borrowed by or on behalf of the seller.\n\n&gt; In a \u2018\u2018naked\u2019\u2019 short sale, however, the short seller does not borrow securities in time to make delivery to the buyer within the standard three-day settlement period. As a result, the seller fails to deliver securities to the buyer when delivery is due.\n\n&gt; **Sellers sometimes intentionally fail to deliver securities as part of a scheme to manipulate the price of a security, or possibly to avoid borrowing costs associated with short sales, especially when the costs of borrowing stock are high.**\n\n**This is what happened today with the price decrease**\n\nSource: https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2009/34-60388fr.pdf - Section \"II.

Regardless, the sentiment stands.*\n\nshares of the stock meaning these short sellers are using Naked Short Selling and intentionally failing to deliver securities in order to avoid borrowing costs and manipulate the price of the stock downward.\n\n# What's to be done?\n\nRule 204.\n\n&gt; Rule 204 \u2014 Close-out Requirements. Under Rule 204, participants of a registered clearing agency (as defined in section 3(a)(24) of the Exchange Act) must deliver securities to a registered clearing agency for clearance and settlement on a long or short sale transaction in any equity security by settlement date, or must close out a fail to deliver in any equity security for a long or short sale transaction in that equity security generally by the times described as follows: the participant must close out a fail to deliver for a short sale transaction by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+4; if a participant has a fail to deliver that the participant can demonstrate on its books and records resulted from a long sale, or that is attributable to bona-fide market making activities, the participant must close out the fail to deliver by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the third consecutive settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+6. In addition, Rule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO requires that participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out fails to deliver in \u201cthreshold securities\u201d if the fails to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days. Threshold securities, as defined by Rule 203(c)(6), are generally equity securities with large and persistent fails to deliver.\n\nYou can read more about this here: https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/242.204 lots of information that I haven't covered.\n\nGamestop *is* or will be classified as a threshold security due to the massive amounts of Fail-To-Deliver's they've accumulated this month, this means short sellers are legally forced to close their short positions and clearing houses will be be required to immediately purchase shares within the time-frame stated above. AKA SQUEEZE WILL BE SQUOZEN.\n\nEdit: According to [this](https://www.theocc.com/Market-Data/Market-Data-Reports/Series-and-Trading-Data/Threshold-Securities-List) website, Gamestop IS listed as a threshold security.\n\n#SHORT SELLERS ARE UNDER THE THUMB, AND ITS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THEY'RE SQUEEZED.\n\nTheir last hail mary is to manipulate the price downward as much as possible to lessen the blow of the inevitable squeeze. We literally have them by the balls and all we have to do is HOLD.\n\n#TL:DR\n\nThe short squeeze is a ticking time bomb right now and all we have to do is hold to win. In a matter of days, short sellers will be FORCED to close their positions and clearing houses will be forced to purchase shares for all Fail-to-Delivers forcing the price to skyrocket and the squeeze to be squozen.\n\nHOLD TIGHT YOU RETARDS, WE'RE GOING TO THE MOON. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\n\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c\n\n*I am not a financial advisor, this is not financial advise, I'm a retard.

In the past two weeks, we've been accused of being an echo chamber and supporting confirmation bias. We've even been called a delusional loser cult by our many haters who are desperate for us to sell our GME shares. Therefore reading this article from a respected objective source like Investor Place really made me feel good after a long time.\n\nFor those who don't want to read the entire article, the author writes a warning to the short sellers. He writes that short-sellers/bears are used to speculators who invest in stocks for profit. Short-sellers know how to deal with these speculators because speculators scare easy and will usually cut their losses, sell, and invest in different stock. However, the author states that short sellers should be very worried because these retail investors from r/WSB are of a different breed. Most are willing to just buy and hold stock. Just buy and hold. The retail investors can hold far longer than the short-sellers/bears would like. Furthermore, according to the author, if these retail investors continue to buy and hold, a short squeeze is possible.\n\nPlease read this article and allow hope to fill your body. Damn right we're a different breed! Our tenacity and patience knows no bounds! We will buy and hold until we win! Either through a short squeeze or through the company turning successful under Ryan Cohen's leadership. Either way, we win! This is why we're diamond hand apes! \n\nAlso to the haters and OGs who keep saying that they're tired of GME threads/posts, I have a message for you. We're not going anywhere. Whine and bitch all you want but you best get used to ignoring our threads. The first share I bought in my entire life has been these GME shares. I invested my entire life savings in BANG gang! I'm down 80% on my investments and I will not cut my losses. For one thing, if I cut my losses, I won't have money to invest in any other stocks. Second, my mama didn't raise no quitter!

He wants to sell you his shitty motivational book and the idea that he can teach you how you can be rich and famous with his \u201cmiNdSeT\u201d when really he got rich by scamming people, and famous for being caught. \n\nPlease. Stop. He is not your friend. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see him try to leverage popularity gained here to a \u201ctrading community\u201d of his own: \n\n&gt; \u201cBelfort will share his favourite market sector in \u201cWolf Report\u201d and give 10 lessons in \u201cWolf Mentality\u201d, which includes tips on \u201cwhat it takes to be a trader, how to handle emotions, the intangibles of success, how to take advantage of opportunities, and how to learn from your mistakes\u201d.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.fnlondon.com/articles/wolf-of-wall-street-jordan-belfort-to-teach-tips-to-armchair-traders-in-new-tie-up-20200819\n\nYeah, how about you eat my stinky dick instead.

However, their 55% figure is technically not a lie, but extremely misleading. I will explain everything.\n\nHere is what they did:Sources (S3 head):[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355990194575564801?s=19](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355990194575564801?s=19)[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448)[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355969693841051650](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355969693841051650)\n\nS3 head is redefining share float to include shares that don't exist in order to be able to say shorted % of float is lower.\n\nit reduces the traditional SI % Float, Instead of Shares Shorted/Float our calc is Shares Shorted/ (Float + Shares Shorted)\n\nSo, by this definition, if a stock is shorted 400% of existing shares (total banana count borrowed and resold 4x) and total shares is 100, short % is calculated like this:400 shorts / (100 shares + 400 longs whose shares are borrowed) = 0.8That is, the normal way we define short % would say it's 400% shorted. S3's way says 80%.\n\nKnowing this formula, we can work back to what S3 would have said the short % of float was using the normal definition of short % of float:55% short of float means for all existing shares + shorts (or, ont he other side of the trade \"longs whose shares were borrowed away to short\") is 55/45 as much as existing shares. Meaning, portion of shares short by the normal definition (% of existing bananas borrowed) is 55/45 = 1.22\n\nThat is, S3's data is telling them that after friday trading, GME is still 122% short.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*disclaimer ripped this off some guy on tradingview, but havent seen it on here (ETCH1234)\n\nEdits: 14 shares @ Avg 110 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e This is not financial advice but I do have a rock hard boner.\n\nTLDR: HEDGE CHANGE MATH MAKE NUMBER GO DOWN, NUMBER GOOD FOR APE.

We are all here for a single reason: To make money on high risk plays.\n\nGains made overnight, or by holding through hell and high water, are to be equally celebrated. \n\nLosses should be mocked, derided, and if unique enough, given the high honor of being put into automod.\n\nAt all costs, if we are to remain different than the rest of reddit, we must avoid the following:\n\n* Politics, we're not here to change the world (sorry) - we just like the stock.\n\n* Divisiveness, calling people bots and shills because they disagree with you only reduces diversity of thought, and drives away our best members.\n\n* Repetitive content, we have just barely enough IQ points to focus on multiple stocks at once, not everything has to be GME or Weedstocks.\n\n* Know it alls, remember rule 7 - \"No Bullshitting\". Stay humble and ask about what you don't know. After being insulted a few times, someone will help you out.\n\n---\n\n#What you can do to keep this place great\n\n* Upvote new and interesting ideas. No one wants to see the front page filled with threads on the same stock or sector.\n\n* Mock people for not understanding something and doing their research, and don't speak beyond your knowledge.\n\n* Bring your own creative ideas to the table! Pick the dumbest company (over $1B market cap) and really read into their filings and let us know what you find!\n\n* Keep content related to megathread topics in the megathread.\n\n* Don't ask \"what the next move is\" - WSB is not your personal army, there is no agenda, no one speaks for WSB, and we don't \"pump and dump\" anything. Simply, we are a watering hole for risk loving individuals.\n\n---\n\n#What we're doing to keep this place great\n\n* The whole mod team has been working overtime, clearing out low quality content and keeping things fresh. Less than 1% of threads make it out of /new.\n\n* In the absence of u/zjz's incredible bots, we're building new tools to assist with moderation efforts, but remain hopeful that zjz can return soon.\n\n* We're planning some fun community events. Can't say too much, but those of you who have been around will know. Guess we'll have to wait and see.\n\n* We will be reintroducing stickied DD threads. These will be automatically stickied based on flair, with high account age restrictions.\n\n---\n\n#Why was my post/comment removed? CORRUPT!\n\nOver the past week, there were multiple *really good* DDs and YOLOs on PRPL, FNKO, SNDL, and many other stocks. The kind of stuff that gives you hope that the old WSB is very much alive.\n\nBut you may have missed them because the front page was dominated with GME related talk. \n\nDon't let the bandwagoners steal your fresh DD. Downvote spam and low effort posts, upvote innovative posts.\n\n---\n\n#A note on the moderation team:\n\nThe team we currently have (missing you u/zjz) is the best we've ever had. Everyone on this team is entirely committed to keeping the subreddit stable and top notch.\n\nThis mod team is a completely different beast than the two mod teams evicted over the past year. They are the ones who have actually put work into the subreddit over the years, and aren't just inactive. They have poured their souls into this sub for years. Yes, some are using throwaways because they'd rather not get doxxed (again), but if my vouch isn't enough, u/zjz vouched for them as well.\n\nMaking everyone a mod for a week, paper trading competitions, automod responses, the discord and plenty of other fun facets of the subreddit were done by this very team. If you don't know what I'm talking about at this point, stick around. You'll have a blast.\n\nP.S. Dear SEC Intern: We don't endorse any tickers or movements.

        "selftext": "By now you have likely seen some $ASO talk. There are some other really good DD posts in WSB that cover different aspects of the stock. This post will break down why I'm bullish AF on ASO and why I believe that it could hit $60 or higher in the next few weeks. Before GME gang jumps down my throat, don't worry, I am still hodling. There are other stocks to make money on while that one consolidates and trades sideways for a little while. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR**: ASO looks a lot like RKT did in February when there was a massive spike. Short interest is high (may be over 45%) on a stock that has been steadily rising since its IPO in late 2020. They beat earnings expectations in a similar fashion to RKT (1.09 actual vs. 0.62 expected EPS = 76% beat). Undervalued stock that is primed for a squeeze means bears r fuk. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n  \nOk, for those of you apes with a few wrinkles, I will explain why you might be able to take your wife and her boyfriend and her parents to Red Lobster and order more than water and biscuits. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \n**2021 is the year of the squeezes and the SI% on this bad boy is HIGH**\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \nHedgies have shorted a wide swath of the market, with a focus on retailers. Makes sense, right? The pandemic has hit a lot of retailers hard, forcing a lot of store closures. Academy Sports &amp; Outdoors has been able to thrive through the pandemic for a few reasons: \n \n1. Their stores are mainly located in southern states whose COVID restrictions are far more lax than their northern counterparts. \n  \n2. Guns and ammo. There has been a massive pullback on offering guns and ammo by big box retailers due to a shift in public sentiment due to mass shootings. However, thanks to the pandemic and civil unrest, more people are buying guns than ever. ASO has not curtailed their gun and ammo offerings, which are a recession-proof sales channel right next to liquor.  \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \nRetailers have been shorted massively (see GME) with the shorts expecting that retail will die with the rise of online sales. Maybe they are right in the long term, but for now, people are still going to stores. Here in GA, you wouldn't know there is a pandemic if people weren't wearing masks. The mall parking lots are full. The short interest on ASO was 45.21% on 3/15 according to TD Ameritrade (compare that to 36.6% on RKT in late February). The stock is up 147% since its IPO in October 2020 without any significant dips, which tells us one thing: none of the shorts are in the money.  I first took interest in ASO about a month ago when I saw them at the top of the shorted list. Investing in stocks in January that had high short interest was quite lucrative for me, so I've been trying to continue investing in shorted stocks that appear to have a bright future. Because bears r fuk and squeezes are fun. \n   \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLet's look at the short interest over time for ASO: \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n|Report Date|Total Shares Sold Short|Dollar Volume Sold Short|Change from Previous Report|Percentage of Float Shorted|Days to Cover|Price on Report Date|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|3/15/2021|12,510,000 shares|$308.37 million|+0.8%|39.4%|9.1|$24.65|\n|2/26/2021|12,410,000 shares|$305.04 million|-3.0%|39.1%|8.3|$24.58|\n|2/12/2021|12,790,000 shares|$306.45 million|+24.5%|41.2%|8.9|$23.96|\n|1/29/2021|10,270,000 shares|$262.50 million|+10.1%|33.1%|7.3|$25.56|\n|1/15/2021|9,330,000 shares|$196.58 million|No Change|44.8%|8.4|$21.07|\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe can see that short interest has increased over time up to a high here of 39.4% on 3/15. TD Ameritrade says 45.21% and we know that short interest is not clear cut, so there is some variance on that  SI%. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMost shares were shorted between $21 - $25 and were still shorted on 3/15. What has happened to the price since 3/15? It was driven down to a low of $23.19. As seen on [this chart](https://i.imgur.com/yrwzR6R.jpg). This means that most of the shorts did not become profitable during the biggest drop since the latest SI% report and likely did not cover. There was another seemingly artificial drop on 3/31 down to $24.50 where some shorts may have covered which [I have put a little box around](https://imgur.com/lss7ppj). Why do I say that it is an artificial drop? Because the company absolutely crushed earnings expectations and was trending up the day earnings were released. That premarket drop was clearly induced and may have been an opportunity for some of the shorts to cover with a small profit, but certainly not the majority. I believe SI% is still very high and there is a **squeeze to be squoze**. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSome may attribute the drop in price on 3/31 to the **IPO lockup expiration**. If you don't know what lockup expiration means, \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n&gt;When a company goes public through a traditional IPO, it usually sets a lock-up period of 90 to 180 days during which insiders can't sell their shares. That rule isn't mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission -- it's a self-imposed one that prevents big investors from flooding the market with shares.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nSo, the lockup  expired and insiders can sell their shares, but why would they? They just beat earnings by a lot and should expect their shares to continue to increase in value. Also, there were further restrictions placed on insider sales that a commenter on another ASO DD thread made. I'm assuming it was valid research. Hopefully they can add it to this post because I don't have the full details, but essentially there is a still limit on how much the insiders can sell at one time as to no shift the price too much and that limit is 1% of the company's value. With a $2.64B market cap right now, that is $26.4M, or about 900,000 shares being the limit on insider sales in a day.  It is entirely possible that the lockup expiry was the cause of the 3/31 drop, which would mean that it was not artificial and it was not a plan by shorts to cover. Meaning SI% is still in the 35-45% range. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n**THE STOCK IS UNDERVALUED**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n[According to Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/results-academy-sports-outdoors-inc-052048433.html) the consensus price target is $32. [Simply Wall St](https://imgur.com/Y95DfqK) has a fair value estimate of $49.99. Prior to the company beating EPS expectations by 76%, I was seeing discounted cash flow values of $35/share. [GuruFocus has DCF value at $36.29](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/ASO/dcf). The price has been depressed. Watching the charts for the last month, there have been pretty massive sell walls in the $25 - $29 range, with order books full of those suspicious algorithm share #'s keeping the price from going up to its fair value naturally. With price targets that have not been fully updated for the earnings beat and increasing volume being between $28 - $35, it seems that the worst case scenario is buying in at $30 will net about a 10% gain or loss. That is attractive to boomers, which could increase retail volume.  \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDid someone say **volume**? Average volume was around 1.5M. Since earnings were released there has been an increase in volume: \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n|Date|Volume|Over/(Under) Average|\n--:|:--|:--|\n|26-Mar| 775,000| (725,000)|\n|29-Mar| 2,390,000| 890,000|\n|Earnings Release 30-Mar| 4,880,000| 3,380,000|\n|Lockup Expiry 31-Mar| 5,040,000| 3,540,000|\n|1-Apr| 3,610,000| 2,110,000|\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nPrice at open on the day of earnings release was $24.98. It closed on 4/1 at $29.01 for a 16% increase and kept going up after hours another $1 or another 4%. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLet's see that in a table: \n\n|Date|Open|Close|% Change since earnings||\n:--|--:|--:|--:|:--|\n|26-Mar|23.92|24.59|||\n|29-Mar|24.98|24.23|-3.0%||\n|30-Mar|24.59|26.74|7.0%||\n|31-Mar|25.79|27.05|8.3%||\n|1-Apr|27.08|29.01|16.1%||\n|After Hours|29.01|30.00|20.1%||\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nNow, I said previously that this stock reminds me of RKT. Strong earnings release for a heavily shorted stock and a delayed increase in price due to massive resistance. That resistance was overcome for RKT from massive buying volume as retail jumped on board. Volume really picked up and the RKT flew. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \n|Date|Open|Close|% Change since earnings|\n--:|--:|--:|--:|\n|25-Feb|20.33|19.9|-2.1%|\n|26-Feb|23.33|21.85|7.5%|\n|1-Mar|23|24.3|19.5%|\n|2-Mar|27.34|41.6|104.6%|\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \nI'm not saying that ASO will have a 100% gain this week, but if you look at what's been happening in 2021 (RKT, AMC, Discovery?), when a stock gets attention and momentum with a high SI%, it is entirely possible to jump 100% in a day. ASO seems similar to RKT in terms of having low float, high short interest, consistently beating earnings, and absolute price. The price point is really important here. Most jabronis can afford to buy into a $30 stock. \n  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Indicators** \n \nI don't put a ton of faith in traditional indicators because we live in the Upside Down now, but MACD and RSI both look very promising, with MACD [on the 3-month chart](https://imgur.com/unGgIgg) \"crossing over\" into positive territory on 3/30. This is a bullish sign for the chart watchers. RSI on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts is over 70. Also a bullish indicator. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n**Conclusion** \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFor me, personally, I think ASO is primed to have a big day this week if it volume gets high enough. By big day I mean spiking to anywhere from $45 - $60 before settling back into $35 - $40 and then slowly growing. If it goes any higher than $60 I will definitely be throwing a pizza party for my local store. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \n\nThanks for reading my post. Good luck out there.

The response I received was amazing and lot of you were asking for weekly updates. So here goes!\n\n**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tkhtpy8hq6r61.png?width=623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cde4524f9c0f45d083d6370cce81e462640a965c\n\nGameStop continues to be the top discussed stock with more than 27K mentions. AMC dropped from 2nd to 4th position. PLTR gained in mentions and was the second most discussed stock last week due to a long-term deal they won with the U.S Department of Energy which is potentially worth 89 million dollars. ViacomCBS also made it into the top 10 but not in a good way. The company has lost 50% of valuation in the last 2 weeks and the sentiment reflects that. Rest all the companies are regulars in the top 10 list!\n\n**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/brep8x8qq6r61.png?width=623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47be46b91c1230ab01f618066a0344277613d285\n\nAbove is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.\n\n**ViacomCBS($VIAC)** was the company with the most growth in mentions. But, the average sentiment across the mentions was negative given the 50% drop in valuation. The stock had crossed the $100 mark on 22nd March 2021 and has lost more than 50% of its value since then. The market had been over-enthusiastic about the stock since the beginning of 2021 due to its effort of transforming to a streaming giant from a traditional cable media company. However, this enthusiasm was short-lived. There might be some scope for a short-term rebound.\n\n**ASO** was also growing in mentions due to their stellar earnings report. The company reported\n\n* Revenues were US$5.7b, approximately in line with what analysts expected.\n* (EPS) crushed expectations, coming in at US$3.79, an impressive 41% ahead of estimates.\n\n**Humanigen(HGEN)** reported phase 3 results of Lenzilumab\u2122 stating it improves survival without the need for mechanical ventilation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The stock jumped 100% on Monday and has stabilized at around 34% increase from last week. \n\n**MicroVision(MVIS)** stock soared 50% on Wednesday. This is mainly due to Microsoft receiving a U.S. Army contract for augmented reality headsets. (It's estimated to be worth $21.9B over the next 10 years). There has been a lot of rumors stating Microsoft is planning to buy MicroVision which predominantly drove the discussions on MVIS.\n\n**FUBO** stock price has been on a continuous decline for the last 2 months (more than 50% drop) and there is now increasing chatter on whether it is oversold or on the path to a rebound \n\n**SOME FAQ\u2019s:**\n\nHow does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).\n\nWhat is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyze financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments\n\n*Disclaimer : I am not a financial advisor!*",

There was another seemingly artificial drop on 3/31 down to $24.50 where some shorts may have covered which [I have put a little box around](https://imgur.com/lss7ppj). Why do I say that it is an artificial drop? Because the company absolutely crushed earnings expectations and was trending up the day earnings were released. That premarket drop was clearly induced and may have been an opportunity for some of the shorts to cover with a small profit, but certainly not the majority. I believe SI% is still very high and there is a **squeeze to be squoze**. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSome may attribute the drop in price on 3/31 to the **IPO lockup expiration**. If you don't know what lockup expiration means, \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n&gt;When a company goes public through a traditional IPO, it usually sets a lock-up period of 90 to 180 days during which insiders can't sell their shares. That rule isn't mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission -- it's a self-imposed one that prevents big investors from flooding the market with shares.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nSo, the lockup  expired and insiders can sell their shares, but why would they? They just beat earnings by a lot and should expect their shares to continue to increase in value. Also, there were further restrictions placed on insider sales that a commenter on another ASO DD thread made. I'm assuming it was valid research. Hopefully they can add it to this post because I don't have the full details, but essentially there is a still limit on how much the insiders can sell at one time as to no shift the price too much and that limit is 1% of the company's value. With a $2.64B market cap right now, that is $26.4M, or about 900,000 shares being the limit on insider sales in a day.  It is entirely possible that the lockup expiry was the cause of the 3/31 drop, which would mean that it was not artificial and it was not a plan by shorts to cover. Meaning SI% is still in the 35-45% range. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n**THE STOCK IS UNDERVALUED**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n[According to Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/results-academy-sports-outdoors-inc-052048433.html) the consensus price target is $32. [Simply Wall St](https://imgur.com/Y95DfqK) has a fair value estimate of $49.99. Prior to the company beating EPS expectations by 76%, I was seeing discounted cash flow values of $35/share. [GuruFocus has DCF value at $36.29](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/ASO/dcf). The price has been depressed. Watching the charts for the last month, there have been pretty massive sell walls in the $25 - $29 range, with order books full of those suspicious algorithm share #'s keeping the price from going up to its fair value naturally. With price targets that have not been fully updated for the earnings beat and increasing volume being between $28 - $35, it seems that the worst case scenario is buying in at $30 will net about a 10% gain or loss. That is attractive to boomers, which could increase retail volume.  \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDid someone say **volume**? Average volume was around 1.5M. Since earnings were released there has been an increase in volume: \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n|Date|Volume|Over/(Under) Average|\n--:|:--|:--|\n|26-Mar| 775,000| (725,000)|\n|29-Mar| 2,390,000| 890,000|\n|Earnings Release 30-Mar| 4,880,000| 3,380,000|\n|Lockup Expiry 31-Mar| 5,040,000| 3,540,000|\n|1-Apr| 3,610,000| 2,110,000|\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nPrice at open on the day of earnings release was $24.98. It closed on 4/1 at $29.01 for a 16% increase and kept going up after hours another $1 or another 4%. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLet's see that in a table: \n\n|Date|Open|Close|% Change since earnings||\n:--|--:|--:|--:|:--|\n|26-Mar|23.92|24.59|||\n|29-Mar|24.98|24.23|-3.0%||\n|30-Mar|24.59|26.74|7.0%||\n|31-Mar|25.79|27.05|8.3%||\n|1-Apr|27.08|29.01|16.1%||\n|After Hours|29.01|30.00|20.1%||\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nNow, I said previously that this stock reminds me of RKT. Strong earnings release for a heavily shorted stock and a delayed increase in price due to massive resistance. That resistance was overcome for RKT from massive buying volume as retail jumped on board. Volume really picked up and the RKT flew. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \n|Date|Open|Close|% Change since earnings|\n--:|--:|--:|--:|\n|25-Feb|20.33|19.9|-2.1%|\n|26-Feb|23.33|21.85|7.5%|\n|1-Mar|23|24.3|19.5%|\n|2-Mar|27.34|41.6|104.6%|\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \nI'm not saying that ASO will have a 100% gain this week, but if you look at what's been happening in 2021 (RKT, AMC, Discovery?), when a stock gets attention and momentum with a high SI%, it is entirely possible to jump 100% in a day. ASO seems similar to RKT in terms of having low float, high short interest, consistently beating earnings, and absolute price. The price point is really important here. Most jabronis can afford to buy into a $30 stock. \n  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Indicators** \n \nI don't put a ton of faith in traditional indicators because we live in the Upside Down now, but MACD and RSI both look very promising, with MACD [on the 3-month chart](https://imgur.com/unGgIgg) \"crossing over\" into positive territory on 3/30. This is a bullish sign for the chart watchers. RSI on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts is over 70. Also a bullish indicator. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n**Conclusion** \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFor me, personally, I think ASO is primed to have a big day this week if it volume gets high enough. By big day I mean spiking to anywhere from $45 - $60 before settling back into $35 - $40 and then slowly growing. If it goes any higher than $60 I will definitely be throwing a pizza party for my local store. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \n\nThanks for reading my post. Good luck out there. [Enjoy this video of my dog eating a banana](https://v.redd.it/p23legq9zuo61/DASH_96.mp4). Dogs are apes too.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPositions = 223 shares. [38 calls at various strikes expirations](https://imgur.com/nC2pwHm).

Growth outperformed value, though both factors saw good gains. Consumer discretionary was the leader with travel and leisure names faring well. Communications services performed well with FB and GOOGL strength. Tech was boosted by AAPL and MSFT. Energy was the only sector lower on the day. Treasuries were mostly firmer led by the five year point of the curve after rates saw some upward pressure on Good Friday when equities were closed. 10s finished above 1.70% again. Dollar weakened vs both yen and euro. Gold finished fractionally higher.

        "selftext": "So everyday I see a new article on Motley's Fool on why it's bad to buy Gamestop or AMC. The best they had to say so far is to say you might see some winnings but it's dangerous. Today it has literally 4 different articles on why you shouldn't buy any m\u00eame stonks one of them titled 'If you bought Gamestop I have bad news.' . My question now is, what is the new material and research they constantly have that justifies that many articles on the same subject, I mena seriously guys 4 in one day. Even theire other articles have a constant clickbaity character with titles as 'Multiply your money X amounts with this stock.' or why did this stock go up being summarised in that well it went up cause stocks sometimes go up. Always presented with emotionally charged pictures trying to sway unsure people reading their articles. So it's not really a question at the end of the day more like a rant, take it or leave it..",

A lot of apes thought being part of a community ment helping fellow apes out. Those fellow apes are now saying they will be pulling out of AMC and GME due to so called selfish apes. If so than so be it.. I'm posting this becuse I believe WSB is a strong community and am honored to be apart of it. I've been holding GME and AMC sense last December and personally I'm  not selling, because for me GME and AMC are full of childhood memory's, just like toys r us once was till the shorts got it. So now it will remain just that a memory. Thankfully  GME and AMC are still around to give me the opportunity to take my son to GME for his video games and my daughter to AMC for date night as my parents did for me. This is how memory's are made. To see the wonder and joy in a child's eyes, to hear the change in their voice when asked to go to GME or AMC the excitement these two simple little thing can bring to a child face. Makes holding GME and AMC priceless not matter the cost. I believe in helping other out that is what makes friends. That is how powerful community's are built. I told my friends I'm in and I will tell everyone at WSB I will be taking my earnings from *** limited to but more GME and AMC why some may ask? Well becuse that's how roll.

I\u2019ve made a post last time, urging people to be smart with buying AMC and GME, as when the market is green, AMC and GME take big hits. \n\nI was correct. \n\nPeople are just going to comment \u201cYou\u2019re a hedge fund\u201d, \u201cWe\u2019re still buying\u201d I\u2019m not here to tell you what you can, can\u2019t, or, should do with your money. However, I\u2019m here to tell you to be a little smart and invest only what you\u2019re willing to lose that\u2019ll not impact you what-so-ever. \n\nThat being said, last thing our economy needs is a recession. \n\nIf you\u2019re truly in it for the cause, then hold by all means. If you can\u2019t handle the hit, smart thing now would be to brace and not keep risking. \n\nWe will probably see a rapid decline in AMC &amp; GME, big sell offs are going to happen as the whales are going to shift their money into the bull market. \n\nQuarter 2 may not be the best for AMC &amp; GME. Although I will receive a lot of hate under this post, I\u2019m just trying to help new investors understand that prices don\u2019t only go up, they go down as well. Last thing I would want to see is people struggling like \u201808. \n\nSo please, don\u2019t let fomo take you over. Be wise and make good decisions. Always remember a quote from warren buffet; \u201cNever lose money.\u201d \n\nCheers &amp; Good luck.",

So why are   they giving up easy tendies and selling hype, or why can't they anymore?\n\nOh, and even though we didn't get to play stonks today, DONT WORRY, the shorts got to play! More at the bottom.\n\n**Intro Material:**\n\n*A    SPAC, Special Acquisition Company, is a way to get a bunch of money  to   take a company public, but it's basically nothing, just a pile of   money  that's looking to buy into a company and behind closed doors,   make an  agreement that gets the company listed.*\n\nSPAC's became a large part of the market since COVID, and banks and funds have been making SHIT TONS off of them.\n\n*\"In 2020, underwriters were the kings of Wall Street.*\n\n*The    biggest investment banks recorded better-than-expected  years, even    though a global pandemic sent shockwaves through businesses  and    households. No business grew more than their operations selling  stocks.    In the spring, clients bracing for economic trouble turned to stock    markets to raise cash.* [*In the latter part of 2020*](https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-flock-to-spacs-where-risks-lurk-and-track-records-are-poor-11605263402?mod=article_inline)*,     it was the SPACs\u2014special-purpose acquisition vehicles\u2014that raised     billions of dollars as a quick and suddenly popular way to get more     companies into* [*the public markets\u2019 wide-open arms*](https://www.wsj.com/articles/lessons-from-a-crazy-year-in-financial-markets-11609410602?mod=article_inline)*. The banks\u2019 fourth-quarter results provide fresh evidence of the equity-underwriting hot streak, raising hopes that SPACs* [*may continue to boost the banks\u2019 results*](https://www.wsj.com/articles/record-ipo-surge-set-to-roll-on-in-2021-11609324381?mod=article_inline) *even as the overall economy shows* [*signs of slowing down*](https://www.wsj.com/articles/weekly-jobless-claims-coronavirus-01-21-2021-11611181914?mod=article_inline)*.\"* [\\[WSJ\\]](https://www.wsj.com/articles/spacs-rescued-wall-street-from-the-covid-doldrums-11611311580)\n\nJust this year alone, **SPACS have already made $80 Billion , 3 months**    , and last year, all of 2020, it was $79 Billion. The surge in SPAC's    can also be said to have helped the recovery from the COVID crash,  and   it looks like they thought it would keep going well into 2021...\n\nBelow    is an ETF of SPACs, and you can see the nice run up until Jerome    Powell announces that the SLR Exception isn't going continue past March:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zrmamj77quq61.png?width=1194&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b40def2bb79c1e0fd8343459ebc413b199eddd7\n\nPurple Line is Powell Saying SLR Exception Won't Be Extended\n\nI've   seen many posts  commenting how the \"SPAC Crash\" is due to market   rotation, or consumer  cyclicals, or fears of COVID, yada yada. **I obviously don't know what caused it**,    but seems to match up pretty damn good with Banks being told they   don't  get to keep all the capital they'd been holding without following    SLR...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Look and see who all has been underwriting all the SPACS:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bucztsj5quq61.png?width=1278&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=305a8c3be18395f42d5cfe211b8b866651bafff0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTop 10 Underwriters for 2021\n\n[**https://www.spacresearch.com/underwriter**](https://www.spacresearch.com/underwriter)\n\nCitigroup, GoldmanSachs, CreditSuisse, MorganStanley, Deutsche Bank, Bank of America, JP Morgan....\n\nThere's    86 on that list, and most of them aren't major banks, though Credit   Suisse and Citi have the bulk from 2020, but the others are described as   \"boutique, private  financial investment firms\" and you can call some   of them Hedge Funds,  and you can call some of them Shirley.\n\nDoesn't matter, but these are the players who have been making BANK over the last year... up till now.\n\nSo let's start to look at some of the other firms on that list,...\n\nlike **Oppenheimer** because **he has become death, destroyer of worlds**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/my56u2n9quq61.png?width=1027&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=142aedec0ff4d751195f926d1709cf2323e1d747\n\nCheck out the Red Box for your own viewing pleasure\n\nNow    let's open up a favorite website of mine that doesn't have the most  up   to date data, but does have a pretty wide range of info on hedge  fund   holdings and shareholders, and you can even check out cashflow: **HedgeFollow**\n\nHere's the top shareholders for Oppenheimer ( just one of the underwriters from the SPAC list)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lbhkf0gaquq61.png?width=1093&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75f0a105fe629aa28c5e02a8508f1155c028b8ee\n\nhttps://hedgefollow.com/stocks/OPY\n\nHi Citadel! (Waves)\n\nYea, **there's all sorts of goodies**    in the SPAC underwriters. Most of them are pretty incestuous when it    comes to ownership, with a TON of overlap between them all, many of  them   just kinda own each other, and that one owns the other back...  round   and round.\n\n**Anyway, what the hell's my point?**\n\nSo    we've been told that Bill Hwang blew up Credit Suisse and probably   half  of all the major banks, but it probably deeper than all that...    actually YEA.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Last year, as of Sept 8 2020, Hedge Funds starting to go long on ViacomCBS, not just Billy Hwang.**\n\n[\\[YahooFinanceArticle\\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/avoid-viacomcbs-inc-viac-142213772.html)\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat's    that mean, no idea, but probably all of them doing something with it    selling off stuff after the merger, maybe, who knows..... shitty  guess,  they wanted a fall guy so they use the \"Bad Boy\"\n\n**Speculating won't do us any good though, so let's just look at how some of the banks are doing.**\n\nGoldman Sachs lays out how the chart reads for those apes not familiar with **IBorrowDesk** but it usually has updated info every 15 minutes on available shares for a company.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ayzny2ubquq61.png?width=1194&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebb021b76e2ee0d245e0f570db08d0bd26eebfb5\n\nGoldman Sachs is  getting shorted the last few days.\n\nAs    of now it seems that most of the action is concentrated in the   European  based banks, and we're starting to see them get shorted, some   of them  shorted HARD!!! Bank of America, Wells Fargo didn't show   anything since  the site maxes out at 10M shares available.\n\nThe   Swiss have taken the first hit, media's been focusing on them for the    last few days, and the red arrows show the change in available shorts    TODAY! Good Friday.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4yhx1c7equq61.png?width=1171&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=214df469ab1493c18862db19fa0ce00da4160ead\n\nLooks   like Thursday HF's bought back shares they shorted CS with, only to   short it again today. BUT, It's still above the average of the last   year.\n\nI would assume that after   the Swiss Bank fell to COVID levels they'd stop shorting, but NOPE!   They're still going at it, granted not AS BAD, but how much lower do   they think it will fall?\n\nThe Germans have been seeing a rounding of shorts for most of March:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/prsaroyequq61.png?width=1175&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89fc70ffd9722cc5f67ca25522ba3086343c81ff\n\nHF's have been shorting the Germans for most of March.\n\nAnd for those APEs that have read \"The Everything Short\" you're going to love this next one!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rhg6hxufquq61.png?width=1183&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4dd27a123753dca48d3bd3fc13ecf1cc926ea4b3\n\nYea, there's only about a handful of shares left for the bonds.\n\n**So what's it all mean.....MMMMAAAANNNNNN.......?**\n\n1. TLT is shorted to hell (Everything Short)\n2. HF's and Banks aren't making the returns from fees and selling SPACS (most of them) like they had in 2020...\n3. OR....    HF's are getting out of SPACsto have to cover shorts for GME or T   Notes  or AMC or .... USE WHICHEVER FLAVOR OF CONFIRMATION BIAS GOES   WELL WITH  YOUR PEEPS!  I sure as hell don't know.\n4. I'm    leanings towards it's not making me want to go out and buy SPY calls,    and maybe April Fools was the SPY hitting FOUR OH OH so that they  could   shoot it over the weekend, but again, I'm posting here, not WSJ.\n\nAs always, don't trust anyone on the internet, call your mother, and none of us are flossing enough.\n\n**Order of Links Used BECAUSE I BARELY SCRATCHED THE SURFACE:**\n\n* [**https://www.spacresearch.com/underwriter**](https://www.spacresearch.com/underwriter)\n* [https://hedgefollow.com/stocks/OPY](https://hedgefollow.com/stocks/OPY)\n* [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/DB)",

It\u2019s obvious that the GME community is the more popular of two. I\u2019ve been thinking very heavily of mingling my way over to GME as well. My question; at this point, looking at utilization, borrow rates, etc., what makes GME in a better spot right now with the price target it\u2019s at now? Is the short float % in better shape? Is the squeeze ceiling higher due to smaller outstanding shares? I\u2019m not asking in a condescending way. I\u2019m asking out of pure curiosity and interest before I either get into GME or keep rolling it into AMC. \n\nI come in peace. \ud83e\udd8d",

I feel like we'll have a good green week across the board after things have been slow.\n\nI had done a couple of options before on AMC and lost...so wanted some advice for people who actually do this stuff.\n\nSPY looks like it will open at or around $403.00 today, and I think that it could go up. At what point does it make sense to consider selling the option...it could potentially be ITM as of today, so of course it will increase in value, and will also have the whole time value as well.\n\nObviously, it could go up as well during this week, but what do people usually do in terms of deciding when to take profits/cut losses? I don't want to get too jumpy, because I do feel like it could have a good week, but I'm also a newbie so I'm kind of nervous as well.

In addition to it being undervalued.\n\n# So What's Root?\n\n**In ape language:** It's a car Insurance technology which relies on machine learning to provide personalized insurance rates. Their business model has fairness and modern customer experience as core values (Check their app/website).\n\n(Boring details) **Details about ROOT:** Traditional Credit-Based Car Insurance Perpetuates Economic and Racial Inequalities as one in three American cannot afford essentials because of car insurance premiums. $ROOT is the only insurance carrier where 100% of customers have the app installed, which $Root uses to collect better data that gives it **a \u201cfour-year head start\u201d** in being able to better price insurance on actual driving behavior.\n\nWith over 10 billion miles of driving data and hundreds of thousands of actual claims, $ROOT has the best data analytics in the industry, As the company noted in it's S-1. The objective is simple, 50% of the claims in dollar terms come from 10-15% of the worst drivers.\n\n# Big boys invested in ROOT\n\nFive months ago, Silver Lake and early Snowflake investor Dragoneer each invested $250 million in $ROOT over 100% higher at the IPO price of $27.  Hill house also added to their previous investment at $27.\n\nTwo years ago, $ROOT raised $350 million in its Series E Funding from top tech investors including Coatue, DST Global, Red point Ventures,and Tiger Global at a valuation of $3.65 billion **or over 20% higher than ROOT\u2019s market cap today**. Ribbit Capital, which is founded by MELI board member Meyer Malka, participated in ROOT\u2019s Series E Funding and then proceed to buy 1 million shares at the IPO price of $27 and an additional 754K shares in the open market at $16.55.\n\n(important) **Rarely, do investors get the opportunity to invest in a disruptive technology company at a significant discount to the prices paid by the worlds leading tech investors  who had the ability to do a deep dive into the technology and cohort data.**\n\n# Why did it get FUCKED by WallStreet in the last 3 months?\n\nLast year was a bad year for an auto insurance company to go public with so much uncertainty around the future of the business due to COVID. Even the bears will admit, $ROOT has great management that knows insurance and technology. However, $ROOT has done a poor job of telling their story to WallStreet(Fuck WallStreet, I'm hopeful that Retail will believe in it as much as we do in $AMC).\n\nThe good news is that this can easily be changed while $ROOT has built the hardest part(The technology). $**ROOT has experienced its share of short reports and fraud claims and broken business models arguments...**\n\nThe original bear argument was centered around $ROOT\u2019s high loss ratios vs.competitors.  However, **ROOT disproved the bear case with additional disclosure in the company\u2019s Q4 2020 shareholder letter showing that it is important to consider** that ROOT has a younger customer base and to analyze loss ratios by cohort rather than on an aggregate level given that ROOT\u2019s loss ratios improve significantly as the customer base ages.\n\n# Root 2021 Growth\n\nGrowth is Re-Accelerating Based on 3rd PartyData. After intentionally pulling back on growth last year due to uncertainty around COVID, management is focused on accelerating growth this year. **As noted by ROOT CFO Daniel Rosenthal on the Q4 2020 earnings call:**\n\n\u201cWe were able to show strong growth despite the decision to pull back on marketing spend towards the end of the first quarter resulting from the global pandemic and surrounding macroeconomic and regulatory uncertainty.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe plan to more than double our sales and marketing investments in 2021following a COVID-driven pullback in 2020. This investment in marketing fuels an accelerating growth trajectory throughout the year.\u201d\n\nThis step up in sales and marketing investment appears to be paying off as there is an acceleration in ROOT daily and weekly app downloads this month based on a leading 3rdparty app data(App Annie).\n\n**Daily Downloads \u2013 ROOT (Green) vs. LMND (Blue)**\n\n[Daily Downloads \u2013 ROOT vs. LMND](https://preview.redd.it/xznvm6vnukq61.png?width=846&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff9268c390d6e6ab44fe070c1521b58cd038c288)\n\n# Now for the Most important Part!\n\n**$ROOT has a short interest of 47.36% Float as of 03/31/2021(Fintel). To put that into perspective, If there's a short interest of %10 that's considered high. If there's a short interest of %20 or greater that's considered extremely high.

        "selftext": "Hello my fellow Apes! It\u2019s your friendly neighbor CrayonEatter (Chris 801). As you know BlackRock has heavily invested in AMC with around 5,926,369 shares. This ranks them as number 3 behind Wanda and Vanguard.  \n\nOk, here is where things get juicy, and yes I mean juicy. Did you know Adam Aron is on multiple boards of directors? Well he is! FYI this is quite common for most CEOs, but I digress. Adam is currently attached to two other boards; Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. and Gaming and Leisure Properties Inc. I was up late last night, and I was going through Adam Aron\u2019s statement of ownership and it led me through this rabbit hole.\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=0001032673](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=0001032673) \n\nSo after seeing Adam Aron\u2019s SOO (Statement Of Ownership), it led me to Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, which I found out he used to be the CEO of the company, and is now just a board member. When I looked at the Fintel filings on Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, I was shocked to see similar institutions holding their shares. Could this just be a coincidence? Both BlackRock and Vanguard are the top institutional investors. \n\n[https://fintel.io/so/us/nclh](https://fintel.io/so/us/nclh)\n\nThis gave me the smooth brain ape idea to check on the other board of directors he sits on.  He currently sits on the Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. board. What did I find? The exact same institutions involved with top ownership of the company. I would like to refer to the old saying: \n\nIt happens once it's an occurrence, if it happens twice it\u2019s a coincidence/chance, and three times it\u2019s a trend. Well Blackrock and Vanguard both top institutional investors once again.\n\n[https://fintel.io/so/us/glpi](https://fintel.io/so/us/glpi) \n\nWhy is this significant? It's because it shows a trend that BlackRock, Vanguard, and Adam Aron are bullish on one another. This is important because Blackrock believes that Aron is a money maker, and also it shows we don\u2019t have to worry about Blackrock fire selling their shares or doing anything else shady. It also shows they have a true business relationship, and what better way to keep that relationship is to have the mother of all squeezes happen. After the squeeze, BlackRock with all its new tendies can buy a big portion of the upcoming 500 million shares issued by AMC. SO FEAR NOT APES! I can say BlackRock is our friend and ally when it comes to this war with Shitadel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot a Financial advisor. This is not financial advice.",

        "selftext": "This might be a little bit of a conspiracy, but I\u2019ve been thinking a lot lately one why it\u2019s so hard to get this squeeze to happen with AMC, why Hedge funds are fighting so hard with us to let go of the short shares, and why they shorted AMC into oblivion to begin with. It\u2019s a bit of a large stretch here, and all i ask is that you suspend your beliefs for a second to kind of wrap your head around where I\u2019m trying to go with this. \n\nPreface: I\u2019m holding 850 shares of AMC, and I\u2019m holding for the squeeze with all the apes. I believe COVID-19 is real, and is a real problem, to whats extent as time goes on, I\u2019m not really sure. This small thesis I\u2019m providing requires a lot of jumping to conclusions, intuitive leaps, and requires a tinfoil hat. I\u2019m sorry in advance.\n\nSources: \n\nYouTube: \n\nDisney is going to kill the movie theaters- Screen rant\nFilm theory: why your favorite movie theater won\u2019t survive 2020- the film theorists\n\n\nSo here\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking: \n\nBefore the pandemic Disney started acquiring major media companies like Star Wars, industrial light and magic, Hulu, 20th century fox, and others. As they started doing this things, they hiked the prices and fees up to show movies at theaters, and started locking other movies up in their vaults preventing them from being seen at all.\n\nAs we all know, in the international markets China is the number one income sources for films overseas. Disney has notoriously edited films to all hell, met outrageous demands, and done things specifically for the Chinese markets just to keep making money for them.\n\nOut of nowhere, the COVID-19 virus shows up, from China, and shuts down the entire country.\n\nThe SLR rule is put into place. Hedge funds can leverage positions with near infinite amounts of money. \n\nHedge funds Target AMC and try to short it into bankruptcy. \n\nWhy? \n\nThinking about Disney\u2019s plans to get movie theater restrictions increased and leveraging streaming services online for a more steady and long-term income source to provide the house of mouse with infinite liquidity, it makes sense to me. Disney privately funded the Short on AMC to close down the movie theater industry in almost it\u2019s entirety in order to force people to sit home and buy subscriptions to their streaming services. \n\nI\u2019m not going to say that Disney orchestrated COVID-19, released it into the world, to shut down movies, to force people to stay home and buy movie subscriptions, but it makes sense.\n\nAnd thats why it\u2019s so hard to squeeze AMC. Because fucking Mickey Mouse wants AMC to go bankrupt and shut all it\u2019s doors forever so they can make the most money in the long wrong. They stand to make the most money. Forever.\n\nAnd then we showed up. And fucked up the entire plan. \n\nIv\u2019e been thinking about it for a little while. Over a year now. Since the YouTube videos came out and I\u2019ve been doing nothing during the pandemic except buying and holding. \n\n\nTLDR: Mickey Mouse is trying to bankrupt AMC to force people to buy Disney+ subscriptions.\n\nWhat do you guys think?

        "selftext": "For reference, I have already stated my bull thesis on AMC to be a recovery play. This merely a theory and I wanted to get some opinions.\n\nThis is the theory I had...\n\nIf Disney were to acquire AMC, it could reasonably wipe out the existing debt at the start and be making $1B+ in net profit each year from the acquisition alone once Covid ends. The reason why I say it\u2019s the holy trinity of acquisitions is you have a company that would have a proven streaming service, production of the some of the highest grossing movies, and then you add theater\u2019s to the mix. \n\nWhat would this mean for all other theater companies? It would be the end of all of them because Disney alone would command viewers by releasing their productions in their theaters first.\n\nIf Disney acquired the biggest theater company in the world, AMC, it would shatter the theater industry leaving only Disney remaining. Let\u2019s say Disney also could improve profit margins on snacks and drinks and raise net profits due to having better existing connections to snack and candy manufacturers respectively.\n\nWhat gives? Why would Disney do that? They could purchase AMC for less than what it\u2019s worth because of their debt. It would likely not bode well for current AMC investors, but it could go either way in terms of a valuation. It could benefit some and not others based on price entry points. Or it may drive the current stock price of AMC into overdrive considering what this deal means which is that Disney, being a movie producer, can now also own theaters based on the removal of the Paramount Consent Decree last year. This means a legal monopoly on theaters if studio companies like Disney, HBO, or Amazon decided to throw their weight around.\n\nPlus as of April, 2021 there is also some news articles coming out about dissenting theater companies not wanting to play Disney movies in their theaters due to unfavorable contractual conditions. \n\n\u201cWe haven't made any threats,\" AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. Chief Executive Adam Aron said in reference to \"Black Widow.\" But \"it is widely known that AMC has threatened not to play movies if we could not find business terms that we found acceptable,\" he said.\n\nHowever it is my belief that not one existing theater would be able to compete with the likes and funding of Disney if they decided to acquire AMC unless other theater companies too found a studio production company to buy them out.",

        "selftext": " \n\nHi everyone,\n\nFirst time poster and just started trading options a couple weeks ago. Ive been stock trading for a while and figured it was time to give options a go as i could see the benefit of paying premiums as opposed to tying up my whole portfolio.\n\nLast week i had purchased some options, these particular ones were:\n\nNLS 5/21 puts with a strike of $15 @ 1.31\n\nNLS 5/21 puts with a strike of 12.550 at 1.13\n\nsA couple days after i bought them i was up about 40% on them and sold them a day or two later to lock in some profit. i was not ITM (i think it briefly dipped into the money) when i sold but saw some pretty steep profit with minimal price movement.\n\nFast forward to this week and i boughht some of the following:\n\nAMC 4/16 puts with a strike of 10 @ 1.13.\n\nAMC 4/16 puts with strike of 9.50 @ 1.10\n\nNow these AMC puts went negative like 50% within a day or two. The first question is why would they swing so quickly into the negative with still so many days out. I would assume its because AMC went up a bit the days following but it wasnt very much , definitely less than $1 on the stock price.\n\nSecondly, the offering gave a huge sell off that put me into the money on both of the puts but they are still showing negative. Now i know that i lose value on my options in time, but these were bought on 3/25, so about a week now with still another 2 weeks left. Why did they decay so fast? im looking at the volitility to explain the deep loss even now that im ITM and i would assume that i overpaid because of the IV?\n\nif my NLS was quickly profitable with little movement, did i mess up by buying so close to expiry? was it simply overpaying on a premium ? when i started this i day traded some F option for 1 contract and i was up like 30% very quickly with minimal price movement. Im exploring and learning greeks to see if there is a component that made this trade such a bad one or rather, so hard to become profitiable while the others were profitable without even getting into the money so much.\n\nGood luck to everyone!",

The choice is not between the two. Seriously. I am currently all in on AMC, but just today I was thinking of buying some GME. I truly believe and have seen exceptional DD that GME is gonna run up really fucking high. I think that big price jump in January was  not the actual squeeze but an artificially inflated price to get people to sell. And it worked. Just my opinion. Not financial advice. You can\u2019t go wrong either way. Just read a bit more because GME may just be further along than AMC and very well could pull the truly big numbers sooner.",

        "selftext": "My brain just wrinkled thinking about the AMC situation.\nTell me if Im wrong.\n\n1. Voting yes means more shares, which means a count for actual viable shares, which is a good thing, right?\n2. Voting yes means share dilution, which in the immediate sense means a price drop, but can also act as a buying opportunity because fire sale.\n3. That fire sale could be bought up by current apes, new smoothbrains who couldn't afford to buy in until now, or by banks. Outcome unknown, but Im guessing apes will buy en masse.\n4. Increasing shares is a way for the company to build wealth, is it not? It just becomes a long terrm play for the real diamond-handers instead of a short-term play. \n5. So theoretically, if you vote Yes, you really like the stock and care about the company...and if you vote No, youre just worried about your bag right now, and not in the long term?\n6. If they do issue shares and you're holding, but buy more once the price drops, you could theoretically make up what you lost during dilution in the long term.\n7. Also, let's not kid ourselves, if they issue shares and price dilution happens, a lot of paperhanders will sell only to buy again after the price hits the dilution low, possibly creating another opportunity?\n\nNone of this is advice, I just like the company and the stock.",

This is a one of a kind DD where the whole DD is basically a TLDR. \n\nIf you want to do a deep dive on $ROOT, yesterday u/faisall1 posted a good DD on $ROOT. [Link to DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mhcq0v/root_the_next_moon_landing/)\n\n1- It has a rare Short interest of 47.36% Float as of 03/31/2021(Fintel). In addition, only 75,000 are available for shorting(2021-04-01 11:33:46.728 UTC). To put things into perspective, If there's a short interest of %10, that's considered high. If there's a short interest of %20 or greater, **that's considered extremely high**. We have 47.36%!!! so a **short squeeze** is inevitable? \n\n **In comparison, as of 03/31/2021, $GME has a short interest of 18.81%, $AMC 17.31%!!! %ROOT is sitting on 47.36%(FINTEL).**\n\n2-  Forget about the short squeeze... It also has a potential of **gamma squeezing**. The open interest of calls is high above 15$ relative to Float. Once it hits and stays above $15, the **gamma squeeze** could take it to a whole **new solar system**. \n\n3- $ROOT is massively undervalued, **without factoring in the Gamma and Short squeeze potential(especially with low float and low valuation 3.2B reminds me of early days of $GME)**, at $LMND multiple **$ROOT would trade at $65** and if ROOT is successful in capturing 2% of the $266 billion US auto insurance market then just the insurance side is worth **10x(120$).**\n\nBUT... instead of doing Voodoo math, **there is no reason this stock is worth less than its IPO price of $27.**  This is at the cross hairs of disruptive technology that is too strong to ignore.\n\n4- For 2021 Growth Potential, There is an acceleration in ROOT daily and weekly app downloads which started in February based on a leading 3rdparty app data(App Annie)(Illustrated in the chart in u/faisall1's post). The downloads of $Root surpass $LMND which is currently more valuated than $ROOT.\n\n**My Short term Price target is 50$+ if a Gamma and Short squeeze fully happen.**",

        "selftext": "  \n\n**The Final Naked Short?**\n\nTL;DR Check this video! [https://youtu.be/b1HrFGwPweA](https://youtu.be/b1HrFGwPweA)\n\n**DTC- 2021-005 Proposed Rule Change**\n\nFirst off, if you don\u2019t already know the Depository Trust Company (DTC) is one of the largest securities depositories in the world and also acts as a clearinghouse to process and settle trades in corporate and municipal securities. The DTC holds eligible securities on behalf of Participants and its activities include transfers and pledges of securities, and the settlement of transactions for Participants by book-entry, free of payment or delivery versus payment. Now that is cleared up so lets begin\u2026\n\nDTC-2021-005 proposes a modification of the DTC Settlement Guide and the DTC Pledgee\u2019s Agreement available here\u2026 [https://www.dtcc.com/legal/rules-and-procedures](https://www.dtcc.com/legal/rules-and-procedures) \n\nThis settlement guide along with all the other guides found on the DTC website put the DTC\u2019s rules and regulations into normal ape English as best they can to help understand what they mean and how they work.\n\nThe very first note of this specific guide states that:\n\n\u201cIt is the sole responsibility of **Participants** to perform a daily reconciliation of their activity and positions with the information, reports and statements provided by DTC. Participants must immediately report to DTC any discrepancy between their activity and positions with the information, reports and statements provided by DTC or other issues relating to the accuracy of the information, reports and statements provided by DTC\u201d \n\nParticipants are clearly the liable party here so let\u2019s first understand who they are before we dive any further. \n\nRule 1 of the DTC By-Laws tells us this: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dk010xma2ur61.png?width=618&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e08891f1c5ba3892efa57b07415ec27277ade10b\n\nPretty vague so let\u2019s go to Section 1 of Rule 2, but keep in mind that any time you see the word Corporation its mean the DTC:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jw3f9fsb2ur61.png?width=557&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65b5d8ae0cef8b1d7ba3c7d973653faccc5bb273\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aek47t9c2ur61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e901c46a381a56420c12d3ad7127869accbc8760\n\nSo essentially a DTC Participant can be brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations on whose behalf DTC was created to hold securities to facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions among DTC Participants.\n\n**Guess who is a DTC Participant?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rgngmbod2ur61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=551a75e0ad1719f602b0a6b8dd79952f459f868f\n\nIf you guessed Citadel, you would be right! Ok so let\u2019s look at the proposed change now\u2026\n\nAccording to the formal document submitted on April 1st, 2021, \u201cthe proposed rule change would revise text in the Settlement Guide and Pledgee\u2019s Agreement to clarify the text with respect to the processing of book entries of Pledge-related activity at DTC.\u201d Go here to read for yourself:\n\n[https://www.google.com/search?q=dtcc+rule+005&amp;rlz=1C1GCEB\\_enUS939US939&amp;oq=dtcc+rule+005&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.3432j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8](https://www.google.com/search?q=dtcc+rule+005&amp;rlz=1C1GCEB_enUS939US939&amp;oq=dtcc+rule+005&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.3432j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)\n\nAccording to Rule 1, the term \u201cPledge\u201d refers to \u201ccreating or providing for a security interest in a **certified or uncertified security**, a securities account, or securities entitlement in accordance with the NYUCC\u201d. The NYUCC being the Uniform Commercial Code of NY. A certified security is a security represented by certificate, which means an uncertified security has no certificate. Securities are banknotes, bonds, common stocks, options as well as many other forms. A securities account has two means, as follows: \n\n1) \u201cused with respect to a Participant or Pledgee, means an account maintained by DTC for the Participant or Pledgee to which Securities transactions of the Participant or Pledgee effected through the facilities of DTC are debited and credited in the manner specified in the Rules and Procedures\u201d \n\n2)\u201d used with respect to DTC, means an internal account of DTC to which Securities transactions are debited and credited to DTC.\u201d \n\nThe proposed revisions would reflect in the text of the Settlement Guide and Pledgee\u2019s Agreement that Pledged Securities remain credited to a Pledgor\u2019s Account unless the Pledgee makes a demand for the Pledged Securities. The respective texts of the Settlement Guide and the Pledgee\u2019s Agreement currently indicate that Pledged Securities are credited to a Pledgee\u2019s Account. The proposed rule change relates to a technical aspect of the operational processing of Pledge transactions and would not impact the rights or obligations of a Participant or Pledgee. \n\nEnglish, man, English!!!! Sorry, this means that the DTC or a pledgee approved by the DTC may demand a participant deliver the securities they pledged to deliver. This theoretically would eliminate FTDs, Failure-to-Delivers. \n\nYou\u2019re probably thinking, \u201cWait! I thought the other Rule change did this? Patience grasshopper, the best is yet to come!\n\nHere are the physical changes taking place in the Settlement Guide, which offers some icing to this cake: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tojo3wtf2ur61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c211e556be3491256730d2d7a3fba529e03681c\n\nTherefore, in the DTC\u2019s system all securities will remain accounted for at all times, which eliminates the possibility to naked short! This is what has been plaguing us in the market for as long as the market has existed. This of course has its pros and cons! The procon sandwich here is that because no more naked shorting will be able to take place, provided a loophole isn\u2019t quickly found, there will never been a squeeze like the ones we will see in the near future with the highly shorted stocks we know in love, Namely GME and AMC, just to name two! Therefore, is it unlikely we will take those HF managers Gucci ties and place them around our heads while we stand on top of the nearest tall object we can find and pound on our chests until we are badly bruised! However, maybe this will prevent the market from suffering severe crashes in the future, the purposeful bankrupting of companies, and the intense market manipulation we have seen of late.\n\nThe big potential con of course lies in the details of Rule 2 Section 2 &amp; 3: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jwrq0wfh2ur61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26ce0b7c5a50d27ba6c2bfecf70be08797023e14\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/clu3nyuh2ur61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ab1e3c6894b34d4ca7277c2da113d95bfea5b34\n\nHence, Citadel having the approval to be a DTC participant we two separate accounts as I mentioned previously could mean that Citadel A acts as a Pledgee for Citadel B the Participant and nothing changes except some words on a piece of paper. It seems like the DTC would still have the numbers in their system and not allow the pledged securities be repledged, but if that\u2019s not the case Citadel A may just lie and say, \u201cOh yea, they are alllllll accounted for!\u201d\n\nNevertheless, if this does pass remember Rule 27: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/addv67vi2ur61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b8453c57a55fca372fbb1c908ef1e8cebe659f7\n\nHere\u2019s to hoping all ends well for us Apes!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/em71yd1k2ur61.png?width=346&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1fb790977e173c4ceaf27926bbd5528534f9d621",

        "selftext": "For everyone who thinks all short-selling is bad, consider how strong the conviction must be for a fund to take an unhedged short position after GME and other squeezing bankrupted \"Smart Money.\" Strategies that involved using leverage to take on risk far greater than could be justified by any gains resulted in losses far above the threshold any reasonable asset manager should allow. There is a reason why taking short positions, has more than purely negative implications for the markets. Before you get mad, let me explain how it can actually can contribute to healthy markets. More importantly, I will talk about how limiting buy orders is far more destructive to shareholders.\n\nA company can take short positions in a number of ways. Many of which are new and now accessible to retail investors. Prior, high borrowing fees and barriers to entry made it only feasible for funds with with a significant AUM and open mandate. Now we have:\n\nInverse leveraged ETF's offering a low opportunity cost way of managing drawdowns and protecting investors with long positions during periods of large and lasting declines.\nIt can give retail investors a chance to make gains during a bear market. Rather than leaving only short sellers to profit, it can help contribute to the rebound and to the long term accumulation of wealth by new and small investors. These gains will likely be redistributed to those who need them the most or reallocated to sectors more deserving of capital based on the FREE MARKET.\n\nOptions, primarily buying puts allows for a set amount to be allocated to stocks or securities that could drop, but have a high chance of appreciating in value enough to offset the limited loss caused by the put expiring useless. Without any way of preventing rapid price declines from causing shareholders to sell more, and more, the innovation, new companies and higher risk plays would become impossible as the cost of margin (or clients with new money) required to stick it out prevents a buy and hold alternative.\n\nFor example, since I purchased Canadian and U.S. energy stocks during their lowest points: I have been able to hold those positions as they appreciate in value by almost 100% or more because I know that I can buy puts without costing much money as they expire and I repurchase OTM contracts at regular intervals to save my portfolio from a Blackswan event like 08 or increase my returns when an event like Covid-19. I may not have the 20X gains some investors have earned this year, but at least I know how much my loss could amount to if a meltdown occurs.\n\nThe F strategy is easy to follow and would have prevented situations like GME and many other times where funds blow up overnight. Forget shorting any of the:\n\nFrauds: If you are taking on a short position because you think a company is being fraudulent, you risk being right but still taking a big L because the company did something fraudulent, illegal or questionable to cover up the same reason to short in the first place. \"Fake it till you make it\" has been used by companies backed into a corner and forced to produce results or go under. We have seen banks and fortune 500 companies committing fraud or crimes because the penalties are negligible and the rewards are great.\n\nFailures: Shorting a failing company can and many times IS asking for trouble because changes in events, new information, technological breakthroughs and cheap debt can give the failing company a chance to pivot and very quickly reverse a trend even after it appears impossible. For example: AR is an energy company in the US that had to deal with low commodity prices, an oversupply of domestic and international crude as well as high borrowing costs. It had a 25+% short interest as it hovered around bankruptcy and dropped below a dollar per share during the worst of the pandemic. Rising oil prices then gas prices, and very low borrowing costs allowed for the struggling company to refinance, cut costs, face less competition and pay down high cost debt. No longer a failing company, many believed despite its massive free cashflow and huge reserves it will drop following a short lived rally thanks to a regime change and aggressive climate policies. Wrong. They shorted it up to $7, with 16% of the float still accumulating losses as of Jan 15.\n\nFads: My last F is particularly interesting right now because of the record levels of short interest in stocks like TSLA and AMC. During a period of intense buying and high rates of participation from the overall marketplace, the potential for price action driven by sentiment alone has never been higher. The time horizon and risk appetite for the AVERAGE investor (very different from a few years ago) combined with access to information faster, cheaper and easily manipulated information can lead to irrational (or rational depending on how you view it) price appreciation in companies that should otherwise have no reason to be rising. Disruptive technology, the FOMOGROMO effect (how I describe the fear of missing out on rapid growth perpetuated by rapid growth) and central banks changing their behaviours. The old saying \"The markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent is so relevant.\" Fads can also become the norm, and by assuming the vacuum created by the disappearance of a trend/fad will cause your short position to pay of and produce a quick gain: you will be surprised to see the emergence of structural changes cementing the fad into long-term patterns of behaviour initially thought to be impossible or very unlikely. For example, at the height of the pandemic, equities such as the IEF (a fixed income 10-year bond etf) rose to record highs as the flight to safety and market turmoil caused a massive demand for low risk, highly liquid fixed income ETFs. Further supported by the Fed buying assets like they are going out of style in fear of a deep recession following the lockdown. After the vaccine showed effectiveness and the economy began returning back to normal, I purchased a very small number of puts that would pay out substantially if nothing happened and more if the economy showed a strong recovery. This should be especially true with rising inflationary pressure. It was not a FAD, the Fed is apparently going to keep buying these assets until the M2 supply hits GME/TSLA levels. (Both two of the most shorted stocks return the highest gains this year.)",

You're absolutely crazy if you don't think this will end GME'S Squeeze... They are going to save their company, but if you don't sell before they do then their taking you're potential profits and even some of yours hard earned money depending on the price you bought in at... I honestly think we can see GME back below $50 a share by next week!\n\n\nHowever we know for a Fact AMC won't be diluting their shares until after the Shareholder Meeting on May 4th... And if you Buy AMC now you can still vote No on the creation of new shares that Even the CEO said they would not be releasing any time soon... it just will give them the ability to if need be.\n\n\nIt's all about Timing... Sell your GME now for the profit you still have or cut your losses and Buy into AMC, Help Us Squeeze AMC during the next 3 weeks... Help Us Vote No to the addition of new shares... In 3 weeks time with your help AMC share price will skyrocket, while GME Stock Price will plummet... Then shit if you want sell off some of your AMC and buy back into GME at an even lower price than you did originally!!!  TEAMWORK MAKES THE DREAM WORK... Make Money with Us, Don't just Give You Hard Earned Cash to Gamestop.... shit you know how many games I've sold them for penny's on the dollar... Don't let Gamestop rip you off again lol! \n\n\nAnd before I get any Hate From GME supporters let me just say, Yous Showed Us The Way... You amazed us by keeping GME price sky high, and squeezing multiple times!!! I respect everything you have accomplished... I just think everyone would benefit (except Gamestop) If yous made some moves and switched Your GME shares into AMC Like ASAP! The first to sell get the highest returns... don't wait for GME to plummet... make the first move!\n\n*I am not a financial adviser, this is not financial advice... please do your own research and choose to do what you think is best for you \ud83d\ude09",
