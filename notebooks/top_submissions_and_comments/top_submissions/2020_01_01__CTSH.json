At that point, I'll decide whether to sell.  $1K is a long ways away .... or is it?",

        "selftext": "After record earnings, the stock market has recovered all its losses, whilst this is a good thing, we autists have to be cognizant of.  They are reporting earnings for 4Q'19.  This was all before the virus.  \n\nEconomic activity since mid January as literally been grinding to a halt in china.  Supply chains maybe disrupted.  With China so interconnected with the world, I feel like the economic damage has yet to be reflected, as its on going real time.  Not sure the actual impact, but expect it to be reflected in 1Q'20 earnings and perhaps even in 2q and 3q....\n\nI'm thinking of potential 2 plays right now:\n\n1. VIX back down, time to load up on $TVIX?\n2. Short ratio spread on $SPY (sell 1 OTM put, buy 2 further OTM put).  I feel like if there is a crash, it will be dramatic....so either there will be a major crash or the bull market will keep chugging on (if not flat)",
