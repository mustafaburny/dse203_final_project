        "selftext": "The valuation on Tesla is now beyond the absurd.  \n\nWhilst European EV sales explode to presently 19% of all car sales this year, Tesla does not even make the top five EV sellers by company at a lowly 7%. (VW 25%; Stellantis 13%; Daimler 10%; BMW 10%; Hyundia-Kia 9%).\n\nTesla, unlike in the US, is simply being outsold by the vast array of alternative BEV models on sale particularly.  VW group alone offers the e-up, ID3 and ID4 (ID5 not yet on sale); Audi e-tron, e-tron Sportback e-tron GT and RS e-tron GT; Cupra Born; and Skoda Enyaq\n\nIn China Tesla has been pushed into 3rd place this year by BYD which has seen EV sales grow from 53K Q1; 98K.Q2; 183K Q3.  Tesla meanwhile has seen China quarterly sales for 2021 flattish at 69K, 62K and 75K.  China will likely sell 3 million EV's this year, half the worlds volume and Tesla sales are flat for the year.  Tesla might sell a lowly 9%.\n\nTesla dominates the US markets of course, where few EV models are on sale.  EV sales might be 3% of automotive sales.\n\nWhilst investors will assert these stats do not.matter and Tesla's valuation is all about  tech, batteries and robo-taxis, it still does not sell any car related tech beyond its own cars.  It still buys it's battery cells.  By its own statements it has a level 2/3 driver assist whilst companies like Waymo are already starting to offer level 4/5 robo-taxis in cities like San Fran (a free trial program has commenced).\n\nWith Tesla slipping badly in the two biggest and mature EV markets globally, it's EV mkt share has fallen from near 18% highs in 2019 to 14.7% YTD in 2021.  With Europe and China likely to see 20% EV sales, the Tesla domination of global car mkts story is looking utterly flawed, yet its market capitalisation is now than the entire companies combined that sell 99% of cars and are adding EV's faster.\n\nTesla is frankly trading at utterly ludicrous levels given the clear reality of global EV market growth.\n\n(These figures all verifiable with CleanTechnica and InsideEVs)",

So what this means is that Tesla would need to make as much profit as 3 Walmart corporations In the future in order to even justify it's CURRENT market cap. It's actually absurd. It almost seems like people who are investing into Tesla don't really understand what it's current market cap even means... \n\nI've heard from a Tesla investor that Tesla would become an industry leader like hibachi Ltd.... And once that happens Tesla is going to moon..... And its like dude .. hibachi Ltd market cap is at 50b . Forget about mooning once Tesla becomes an industry leader like hibachi Ltd. Tesla would need to be an industry leader like 20 hibachi Ltd  just to even justify it's current valuation lol.... \n\nIf Tesla becomes the world's most profitable corp like apple. Get this .... You'll justifiably only 2x your money if you invest In it now \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02 .

The company is at it's early stages. However, the stock valuation of this company is not. The stock valuation of this company is already at a level where it can swing it's dick around and smack China with it. \n\nThe question is. What would Tesla even need to do.... For profit at a level where it's absurd valuation is justify? \n\nAnother note Toyota is currently the most profitable car company and it's valuation is 300b..... (I'm not saying Tesla is just a car company) Tesla's is already at 1.2t . 4x the most profitable car company already... Without making any profit... Tall order to fill . Let's just say that.",

I am able to deposit $10,000 in instant deposits, but have nowhere close to that money in my bank.

        "selftext": "Hey guys I wanted to share my story in hopes that some of you defend will learn from my mistakes. Also for those of you who are experiencing something similar, I want you to know you can make it. So without further ado, here is my story (proof).\n\nhttps://ibb.co/3r1pNVX\n\nFor every gains porn post someone out there is on the other end with a loss. I can still remember when the GME runup began. I was so sure it would blow over in a day, and I picked up 10k in 3 month out puts just as GME crested 40 dollars. I remember as it skyrocketed I even found myself up on my position as the I/V grew. But I wanted more and I was so sure it would be back to 4 dollars in a month or two. Lesson one, don't get too smart, and don't fight the market.\n\nWell, a few months rolled by and the expiration on my options was getting close, they had slashed in value down to a third and even though GME had fallen, they weren't worth what I paid for them. I could have cut my losses and been out about 5k. But this is where I made my second mistake. Trading options on emotion. I couldn't believe my puts were priced correctly so I rolled them out a few more months, and aggressively. My position was now 50k instead of 10k. I couldn't let go of my ego and take the loss.\n\nWell, as fate would have it, a few days later GME would rip back up into the 200s. My freshly rolled position, started collapsing, and fast. I remember sitting at work every day, constantly pulling out my phone and staring at the GME ticker, waiting for any drop, hoping to be saved. But, my salvation never came, and my position got worse and worse. Enter my third mistake, doubling down. At this point I was desperate. I wanted, needed, to make my money back, so I averaged down, and averaged down again. My position was now worth just over 100k.\n\nWith each passing day, my position ticked down in value. I remember one day so vividly as I saw my losses pile up into the 80k range I noticed sharp pain in my chest. It had been getting harder and harder every day, and the extreme stress was taking a toll on my body. I held on for a few more days, but the pain was getting worse, and I was literally shaking (tm), from the stress. Finally I called it. I closed my position down a total of just over 100k. It was one of the hardest things I've ever done. \n\nAs pathetic as this sounds, I remember actually crying several times thinking about what an idiot I was. When you lose that kind of money, and for me this wasn't play money, it takes you to a dark place. I remember ringing in my head over and over, what was I thinking, how could I make such a mistake. It was one of my lowest points ever, and it felt like I would never feel normal again, anyone who has been in my shoes knows what I'm talking about.\n\nWell, it's been 7 months sense then and I will never touch an option again. I know now that I have a gambling problem and I can't put myself in that kind of position. It has been hard, to come to terms with losing something I spent many years of my life building, but I have made it through. To anyone who is where I was, right now, I know how it feels, and I promise you the age old adage, time heals all wounds is true, it does get easier.\n\nAnyway, thanks to anyone who read all the way through, I hope I can somebody out there learns from my mistakes, or at the very least cracks a smile laughing at my misfortune. I wouldn't be who I am now without my experience, so cheers you beautiful bastards.",

        "selftext": "I am a college student who recently decided to try my hand in the stock market. I was having fun just moving shares around and making small amounts of money. Then a few weeks ago I decided to try options. I bought an apple call that went up a couple hundred bucks. I was amazed at how easy it was to make money with options. Then I decided to put a bunch of money into Delta Airlines calls expiring in January and February. Initially they went up, and I was making more money than ever before. But then they started to go down. As I'm writing this, my weekly chart is down almost 20%. This is all the money I had in my saving account. I'm not sure when I will crack, but at this rate it will be sometime soon. I'm still holding, but I can't focus on school or anything else because all I can think about is how much money I'm losing.\n\nMy question is, how do you guys deal with waking up in the morning and seeing huge losses?

        "selftext": "It\u2019s because the logistic is a nightmare right now. \n\nI import things from China. There are thousands of companies like mine. We are the one that sells shit to ur the distributors, the distributors sells to stores. We are also the one directly sells on Amazon and other e-commerce website. \n\nPre COVID, a 40ft high cube costs me only $4000 from China to Long Beach. Currently it costs me god damn $20000, and that doesn\u2019t include land transport. If I want to sent a container of goods to Ohio, the total cost on shipping alone is like $40000, excluding import duties. Back in the day shipping make up abt 30% of my cost, it makes up 60-70% now. Pre COVID a container of nice double layer fleece lining hoodies cost me 60 includes shipping. It costs me 100k this year. \n\nThere are 110 some container ships stuck outside of Long Beach. You probably have no idea how many that is..ima use the nice fleece lining hoodies as example again. Each 40ft high cube carry\u2019s 6000 this hoodie (so 20ft carry abt 3000). Each ship carry 20000 TEU (20ft equivalent units. there are also some 2 million 20ft equivalent units (TEU) still in the port waiting to be hauled.. \n3000*20000=60 million hoodies \n110*20000=2.2million containers on ship stuck outside still. \n2.2million+2million=4.2 millions on containers total. \n4200000*60000000=252000000000000\n\nUS population is 333000000 \nThat\u2019s 756 thousand hoodies for each personjust stuck there to be distributed! \n\nLet\u2019s say my number is off by 50%, it\u2019s still 378 thousands hoodies just stuck there! \n\nWe can\u2019t unload at Houston or New York cuz it will cost us even more\u2026 \n\nIt\u2019s not the demand, it\u2019s the problem of supply. \n\nIt\u2019s not that there are too many monies were printed, who cares if we print more money, we can print unlimited useless pieces of paper and buy real goods from China ( export our Inflation)!\n\nSo, if u see on the news that the supply chain has been fixed, or the port of Long Beach has been cleared, or you know inflation is about to stapled.. until that , whatever the fed say is bs.\n\nSide note Biden should declare national emergency and have nat guard come in and help haul these sticker goods.",

        "selftext": "Congress has passed a $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill, delivering on a major pillar of President Joe Biden's domestic agenda after months of internal deliberations and painstaking divisions among Democrats.\n\nThe final vote was 228-206. Thirteen Republicans voted with the majority of Democrats in support of the bill, though six Democrats voted against it.\nThe bill now heads to the President's desk to be signed into law, following hours of delayes and internal debating among Democrats on Friday, including calls from Biden to persuade skeptical progressive members of the Democratic caucus.\nThe legislation passed the Senate in August, but was stalled in the House as Democrats tried to negotiate a deal on a separate $1.9 trillion economic package, another key component of Biden's agenda that many Democrats had tied to the fate of the infrastructure bill.\nThe legislation will deliver $550 billion of new federal investments in America's infrastructure over five years, including money for roads, bridges, mass transit, rail, airports, ports and waterways. The package includes a $65 billion investment in improving the nation's broadband infrastructure, and invests tens of billions of dollars in improving the electric grid and water systems. Another $7.5 billion would go to building a nationwide network of plug-in electric vehicle chargers, according to the bill text.\nBiden called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi just before midnight to congratulate her on the passage of the infrastructure bill, a source familiar with the call tells CNN. On the call, Pelosi thanked Biden for his help in getting the bill over the finish line as well.",

        "selftext": "So I've been sitting on the sidelines for quite a while on Tesla while everyone else around me go all in. My gut feeling tells me that if everyone flocks to one thing, there must be something fishy about it all.\n\nI can't lie, I've been tempted time and time again to jump in, seeing my friends make 10% in a single day and what not. I guess I am only human. However, after reading the works of Buffet, Howard Marks, Munger, and those gentlemen (which i consider my teachers), Tesla just seems to go against their philosophy; especially when it comes to the margin of safety principle. \n\nNow Tesla is a special case, if we look at Tesla as a company, their dept is consistently decreasing, equity and profits are growing like crazy, all of that is good. It's just the valuation. Currently at a P/E of \\~300 for instance, it means they have A LOT to back up for in the near future and the public obviously has high hopes in them. But my question is, what exactly is this hope? I am not very informed about Tesla, neither am I an engineer, which is why I wanna hear some of your opinions about them. \n\n\\- What is their specific moat when it comes to the electric cars? How will this moat be protected by other automobile dealers? (i.e the Germans, Ford, the Chinese, etc...) Is it just their brand or do they have superior technology that will actually be hard to replicate/improve by other companies in the coming 10 years? \n\n\\- What other ventures are they going into besides cars? Is it A.I? What constitutes as A.I? If it is a personal robot who does the dishes for you and cleans your house, in what way will they have superior engineers compared to the other giants such as Alphabet and Microsoft? And why will they perform better than them?\n\nBasically, what is it that they do that makes people so confident about them, and what is it that accounts to this valuation?",

        "selftext": "I see a lot of articles and posts these days talking about supply chain issues: whether it's about how expensive it is to buy a shipping container, or that there isn't enough space at shipping ports, or that there aren't enough truckers, etc. etc.\n\nHowever, these are all micro-level symptoms of a macro-level problem. Don't miss the forest for the trees. Journalists need to write something new every day (or every hour it seems), even if there isn't anything new to say. Which leads to a lot of noise that clouds your mind from making sense of what is really happening in the world.\n\nIn my view, the problem is clear: governments overdid it with stimulus. Unlike the 2008 Global Financial Crisis where policymakers did too little and acted too slow, this time around governments decided to err on the side of doing too much too quickly. If you look at consumer spending on FRED, it didn't just fully recovery from the 2020 shock, it's arguably on a stronger trajectory than it otherwise would be without the pandemic! At the same time, unemployment is still high and labor force participation is dreadfully low! The Fed created such a tremendous wealth effect, people are earning multiple years worth of stock market returns in the span of months. I'm not surprised many people are taking career breaks or retiring early. So why do we have red hot inflation? Because we're printing more money and making less things, it's that simple.\n\nThe inflation problem highlights how difficult it is to be a policymaker. On one hand, you don't want to under spend and risk seeing long-term economic scarring, but if you stimulate too much, you risk fueling inflation as well as asset price bubbles. The other factor at play is the politicization of economic policy. You're everyone's favorite politician when you're fueling spending, but it's hard to get reelected when you advocate for cutbacks. Prudent policymaking requires spending when times are bad, and building reserves when times are good - politicians have forgot about the latter half of that equation.",

        "selftext": " \n\nIt seems towards the end of the rotations we've been having starting with value stocks and ending with mega pumps from SPACs, companies with zero revenue \\*cough Rivian\\*, and weed stonks.\n\n**Catalyst**\n\nRumor has it, that Rep. Mace (R) from SC is proposing a bill to legalize Marijuana at the Federal level. \"Those who\u2019ve [seen](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-12/republicans-pot-bill-to-propose-lower-taxes-more-state-control) Mace\u2019s draft say it would regulate cannabis more like alcohol\". This bill coming from the republican side may garner more support than Sen. Schumer's already proposed bill. \" Mace\u2019s proposed excise tax is 3.75%, according to Cobb -- a fraction of the 25.5% that Schumer\u2019s legislation would put on marijuana products.\" Personally, I've heard this bill could be brought forward as early as Monday 11/15. But, that's just chatter.\n\n**Well, which dank stock should I buy?**\n\nI've looked at various companies and honestly diversifying into a few may be worth it. However, I have the greatest conviction in **$TLRY** the largest market share in Canada, Germany, and ties to the US with Sweetwater brewing. Those with the greatest dependence on the US may outperform. But, screw the fundamentals because that's not how this market works.\n\n\\*for simplicity I'll just illustrate $TLRY to represent the Marijuana sector since it has the largest market cap\\*\n\n**Institutions buying $420M+?**\n\nIn general, Institutions have been buying these Cannabis companies as they blew off earlier in the year. Heaviest buying has been in $TLRY with the heaviest selling in $SNDL. Interestingly most of the buys come during Q2 which means most of these institutional apes are holding some serious bags. They could be down anywhere from -4% to -33% depending on when they bought in Q2. So, don't be surprised if this gets pumped and ultimately dumped to lighten their bags.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n0904d0bzmz71.png?width=2386&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb69d29fe355abc07e40a01cc412993d9f8b3b3b\n\n**Leaders in the Sector?**\n\n**$ACB** and **$SNDL** currently lead the move upward as they are right at their 200-day moving average. Does that mean they'll continue leading the way? I don't know. Does that mean the others have more to run? I can't see the future, you twit. As a result, diversifying in this sector might be the way to go.\n\n**Crayons**\n\nIt appears **$TLRY** has started to round out and will try to push hire. The green lines are historical supply/demand lines at candle closes. I'm setting my stop near the recent low of $9.98 and will continue to sell out starting at $15.50 to $30.00 for a gain close to between 20% and 130%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cssq7ipczmz71.png?width=2712&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80aa4805f62ae8a139a233ae266c836122544bd9\n\n**Social Traction**\n\nAnother reason I am choosing to look at **$TLRY** is because of all the weed stocks, **$TLRY** gains the most attention on google trends and is the 2nd most mentioned on WSB behind **$SNDL.**\n\n**Positions**\n\nI literally have none and plan on buying Monday with any of you that like the stock(s). I'll update after buys are in. \n\n**\\*This is literally my uneducated, unlicensed opinion. Don't listen to me. You'll Lose money\\***",

        "selftext": "Rvian has obtained legendary status among the Pets.com of the world with its ability to command a market cap of 130B+ on virtually 0 sales. Even banking Rivian will be able to deliver on all of its pre-orders (which are never guaranteed) there are so many obstacles and risks to their success; they should not command a massive multiple. Currently their biggest competitor Tesla is trading at 25x revenue and has traded from 15-30x revenue over the last 1-2 years. Today Rivian is trading at 150\u2013200\u2013even 250x Price to Revenue. While comparing Tesla ( a well known, huge company with multiple production plants, battery tech, great engineers, market dominance,  Elon, a huge following, massive assets, full AI self driving and a proven production / delivery method) is like comparing apples to apes, let do it. Lets use Price to Revenue as the model and compare Rivian revenue to Tesla revenue. To be fair we should take the anticipated cars being made this year (Rivian says they hope 1k)* average cost of each car (67.5k base + extras = ~75k lets say) = 75mm in sales. To make it a better comparison lets make this a yearly number. Also lets make a great case for Rivian with great production efficiently, no problems, continued refinement, and growth from current cars per day(CPD) (current pace is ~3per day or ~320 by EOY but they hope to deliver 1k cars by EOY 2021 which is goal of 1k/108 days since 9/14/21 production start = CPD of 9.25) and lets double it next year. That would give us 9.25 x 2 x 365 x 75k = 506mm per year in revenue and make today\u2019s valuation (at 131B) 258x FY 2022 revenue only after assuming a myriad of extremely positive assumptions. For fun lets triple 9.25 and even then at 760mm in revenue that is 172x FY2022 revenue. Said another way, in order for Rivian to have the same Price/Revenue as Tesla\u2019s average of 22 they would have to produce 5.95Billion in revenue or 79.4k cars per year or ~218 CPD aka 72x their current CPD rate or 23.5x their 2021 target CPD rate. So lets reverse engineer that to find a reasonable stock price \u2014 FY2022 best case sales 760m*30 (highest Tesla P/R)=22.8B or ~21$ per share which is still ~8x what Amazon paid about a year ago. Anyone else smell this shitty bubble and going to short this?",

On December 23rd it yet doubled what it had quadrupled hitting $22.40 Now everyone was convinced it couldn't go up further. On Jan 19th we saw it hit $45.6, Now of coarse it can't possibly go up any further. WRONG again, From here we saw it go up to $159 on Jan 25 and still it continued until it finally hit 483 on Jan 28th. Everybody thought it was going to go back trading below $20 but here we are 11 months later, and it has broken out of a long penant I bet it at least Doubles its all time high! Plus we are seeing daily increases in volume yet volume is lower still than in august but we are above the august bump levels. Huge indicator that we are dealing with a full fledged blue pill RAGER. None of that Chub BS!!!!",

He is one of those people who drinks too much, is too loud, and is generally terrible with money. I intern in the financial industry, in actual trading, but he just seems to ignore me completely. \n\nHe has this idea that he missed out on getting rich through bitcoin, so he thinks buying Ethereum at all time highs is equivalent to buying bitcoin at 4K. He\u2019s not understanding that price means nothing and market cap is a more relevant indicator of your timing. Ethereum already has an enormous market cap and the upside is limited. He is also one of those who don\u2019t understand that there is no thing as getting rich quick. I\u2019ve tried telling him about just holding a diversified portfolio and making monthly/yearly contributions but of course it falls on deaf ears.\n\nI\u2019m worried that if/when we see another 50% drop overnight, he\u2019s going to be wiped out. He has kids who will feel it too.  And i get it, a lot of Americans are feeling insecure about retirement and they feel like they must make last ditch efforts to make up for years of poor finances. But this is reality, I know for certain that this guy is going to get burned chasing the next big thing. He got lucky and bought GME, which he then blew the proceeds on luxury rentals and alcohol. Now I think he\u2019a chasing that high again.\n\nHow do I not feel responsible? How do I wake him up? Should I not care?",

Facebooks profits were almost more than Tesla\u2019s total revenue. FB profit margins are far better than TSLA, they have much more cash on hand and a far better balance sheet when looking at total assets over liabilities. If you\u2019re still buying shares of Tesla or holding please explain why because I just don\u2019t understand it. I do think Tesla will be a great company over the next 10 years but I feel all their growth potential is already factored into the stock price and that\u2019s best case scenario.

        "selftext": "Deere DE -3.45% &amp; Co. won\u2019t raise its offer to striking workers after a second vote to ratify a new contract failed Tuesday, a company executive said.\n\nMarc Howze, the chief administrative officer for the farm and construction equipment manufacturer, said the company made its best and final offer in a six-year proposed contract that members of the United Auto Workers union voted down by a margin of 55% to 45%.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not more bargaining to be done,\u201d Mr. Howze said in an interview Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve done all we can do. We don\u2019t have a better offer to provide. This is it.\u201d\n\nDeere will continue operating its U.S. plants with nonunion employees, Mr. Howze said, and it is considering sourcing replacement parts and machinery from its overseas plants.\n\nUnion leaders and negotiators for the striking Deere workers are discussing their next steps, a UAW spokesman said. The union had no specific response to Mr. Howze\u2019s assertion that Deere won\u2019t negotiate on a third offer with bigger raises.\n\nThe strike at Deere, the largest U.S. farm equipment manufacturer by sales, is set to head into its third week at a time when tractor and combine sales have been booming, and farmers are planning purchases for the coming crop year. Some farmers worry that an extended strike at the Moline, Ill.-based manufacturer could deepen shortages of new equipment and drive up prices for already-scarce used equipment, with factory production currently constrained due to a lack of semiconductor chips and other components.\n\nThe contract rejected Tuesday would have given more than 10,000 striking Deere employees an immediate 10% increase in pay, plus an $8,500 bonus for each worker and additional 5% pay raises in 2023 and 2025. That proposal followed a previous contract offer rejected by Deere workers Oct. 10.\n\nDeere shares settled 3.5% lower Wednesday, with U.S. stock indexes generally moving higher.\n\nEmployees said Deere should have provided bigger raises and benefit expansions, given a surge in the company\u2019s farm and construction equipment sales, and the pay increases other employers have offered this year to recruit workers. Deere workers went on strike Oct. 14, the first walkout at the company since 1986.\n\nMr. Howze said the company negotiators were willing to consider employees\u2019 demand for better raises and benefits after the first contract offer failed by a wide margin. But he said the company won\u2019t go any higher than the second offer, which he said would cost Deere an additional $3.5 billion over the life of the contract.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no benefit to be gained by staying out,\u201d Mr. Howze said, referring to strikers holding out for a better deal by prolonging the walkout. \u201cWe want to get people back to work.\u201d\n\nMr. Howze said Deere executives were encouraged by the level of support for the second offer after 90% of the voters reportedly turned down the first deal. He declined to elaborate on how Deere is maintaining operations with nonunion employees, but said some U.S. employees are working around the clock at some sites.\n\nEmployees of Deere have said they felt empowered to push for better terms from due to the current strength in the company\u2019s business, versus negotiations in past years when equipment sales were slower, or general economic conditions weaker. For the full fiscal year, Deere has projected about $5.8 billion in income, compared with $2.8 billion in 2020 and $3.3 billion in 2019.\n\nRising demand for agricultural commodities and poor weather in North and South America have tightened crop supplies over the past year, and driven a rebound in the farm economy.\n\nwww.w sj.com/articles/deere-says-its-done-bargaining-after-striking-workers-reject-second-contract-offer-11635976220",

        "selftext": "Alibaba missed revenue and earnings expectations for the September quarter, as slowing economic growth in China and the country\u2019s crackdown on its technology companies weighed on results.  \n\n\nHere\u2019s how Alibaba did in its fiscal second-quarter, versus Refinitiv consensus estimates:   \n\n\nRevenue: 200.69 billion yuan ($31.4 billion) vs. 204.93 billion yuan estimated, a 29% year-on-year rise.  \nEPS: 11.20 yuan vs. 12.36 yuan estimated, a 38% year-on-year decline.  \n\n\nAlibaba has been a victim of China\u2019s crackdown on its domestic technology industry which has seen a slew of new regulation brought in from antitrust to data protection.  \n\n\nWhile China\u2019s tech giants have grown largely unencumbered over the past few years, Beijing has looked to clean up some of the behaviors of its corporates. Alibaba was fined $2.8 billion in April as part of an anti-monopoly probe.  \n\n\nMeanwhile, China\u2019s economy slowed down in the third quarter of the year.  \n\n\nExpectations were low coming into the fiscal second-quarter earnings report as a result, with analysts expecting it to be one of the most challenging quarters ever for the Chinese e-commerce giant.  \n\n\nThe company is coming off the back of Singles Day, a huge shopping event in China where e-commerce platforms push heavy discounts and rack up billions of dollars of sales.  \n\n\nAlibaba raked in gross merchandise volume during the 11-day period totaling 540.3 billion yuan ($84.54 billion). Any revenue Alibaba gets from this event will not be reflected in the September quarter.\n\nLink: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/18/alibaba-earnings-fiscal-q2-revenue-misses-earnings-plunge.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/18/alibaba-earnings-fiscal-q2-revenue-misses-earnings-plunge.html)",

        "selftext": "The October inflation in the US was 6.2% on an annual basis, which is super high given the recent history of sub-3% rates.\n\nThat said, I come from a place where people were high-fiving when they get anywhere 6% inflation. Double digits were the norm back there. When I was a kid we lived under hyperinflation which is a complete shit show, people get their paychecks and immediately go buy their groceries for the month. This is not a figure of speech, they really did go IMMEDIATLY because the prices were readjusted 1 or 2 times IN THE SAME DAY. Concept of savings was non-existent. Either you buy as much US Dollars as possible or put in some asset that has intrinsic value like real estate. The house I grew up was huge, and I learned that was not because my father was in a good financial situation, but rather it was the only option to dump all his savings before it lose half of its value in matter of weeks.\n\nLong story short, my bar is a bit out of place here... so should I be concerned with the 6.2% rate? My take on this: likely FED will increase rates, which will devalue bonds and stock prices. But then this should be already embedded in the current asset prices, so I don't think I should be doing anything with my portfolio here.",

Below is a story of a person from the industry.\n\n&gt;We had a group of 5 mutual funds and our decision to decide what fund to put them in was based on one question: \u201con a scale of 1-5, what is your risk tolerance\u201d.

I wondered how even without an advisor why people couldn\u2019t/wouldn\u2019t pick pretty much any mutual fund and put their money there  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I got paid based on how much I got people to invest and thought it would be easy money to convince people to make their assets grow but it was damn hard. Most clients had money in a CD and would refuse to move it \n\nHave you ever thought of going to money managers? \n\nMaybe you tried - what was the experience like?",

        "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/02/zillow-shares-plunge-after-announcing-it-will-close-home-buying-business.html\n\n&gt;Zillow, the digital real estate company, said on Tuesday that it\u2019s exiting Offers, its business that buys and flips homes, and eliminating 25% of its workforce.\n\n&gt;The announcement was attached to Zillow\u2019s third-quarter earnings report. The company\u2019s revenue and earnings missed analysts\u2019 estimates.\n\n&gt;\u201cWe\u2019ve determined the unpredictability in forecasting home prices far exceeds what we anticipated,\u201d Zillow CEO Rich Barton said in the release. \u201cContinuing to scale Zillow Offers would result in too much earnings and balance-sheet volatility.\u201d\n\n&gt;The stock dropped about 7.5% in extended trading following a 10% plunge during regular market hours. The shares are now down about 10% for the year as of Tuesday\u2019s close.\n\n&gt;Here are the key numbers from earnings:\n\n&gt;Earnings per share: loss of 95 cents adjusted vs. profit of 16 cents per share expected in a Refinitiv survey of analysts\nRevenue: $1.74 billion vs. $2.01 billion expected by Refinitiv\nRevenue in Zillow\u2019s Offers business, which competes with Opendoor, climbed to $1.17 billion in the quarter. That\u2019s way up from $186 million a year earlier, which was in the middle of the pandemic and in a dry period for transactions. However, the homes segment, which is mostly Offers, lost $422 million in the quarter, producing an overall net loss at the company.\n\n&gt;Shares of Opendoor rose 7% in extended trading. The stock plunged alongside Zillow earlier in the day, dropping 15% at the close.\n\n&gt;Zillow launched Offers in December 2019, starting with Southern California markets. The iBuying, or instant buying, product allowed homeowners to sell their home to Zillow for cash, eliminating a lengthy bidding, sales and closing process. They also didn\u2019t have to worry about costly repairs before putting their house on the market.\n\n&gt;\u201cAfter closing on a home, Zillow will take care of necessary repairs, working with local contractors to complete projects like a fresh coat of paint, servicing HVAC units and other work a typical homeowner would do to get their home ready for sale,\u201d Zillow said in a press release at the time.\n\n&gt;But the home-flipping market proved to be a drag for a company that had built its brand on listing homes across the country and helping buyers and sellers connect through a marketplace. Prior to shuttering the business, the company said on Monday that it would stop buying houses through the end of the year, citing tight labor and supply markets.\n\n&gt;\u201cWe\u2019re operating within a labor- and supply-constrained economy inside a competitive real estate market, especially in the construction, renovation and closing spaces,\u201d said Jeremy Wacksman, Zillow\u2019s operating chief, in a statement this week. \u201cWe have not been exempt from these market and capacity issues and we now have an operational backlog for renovations and closings.\u201d\n\n&gt;Barton told CNBC\u2019s \u201cClosing Bell\u201d after the report that Zillow\u2019s ultimate failure was its inability to predict housing prices accurately. At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the market dried up. It then bounced back dramatically, and prices in many markets have climbed to record levels.\n\n&gt;For the home-flipping business to be profitable, a company has to be able to sell a home for more than the purchase price and have enough margin remaining to cover all the other costs, such as maintenance and sales and marketing expenses. Barton said the company realized that it\u2019s not in a position to accurately predict where home prices will be in six months \u201cwithin a narrow margin of error.\u201d\n\n&gt;Additionally, Barton said the Offers product reaches only a small sliver of the company\u2019s overall audience, which is effectively the entire market of homebuyers and sellers across the country.\n\n&gt;Zillow\u2019s internet, media and technology business grew revenue 16% in the quarter to $480 million, with gross profit of just over $130 million.\n\n&gt;\u201cWe just determined that being an iBuyer was too risky, too volatile and ultimately addressed too few customers,\u201d Barton said. He added that, in closing the business, \u201cthe logic is clear, the emotion is difficult\u201d because of the layoffs.\n\n&gt;Bloomberg reported on Monday that Zillow was looking to sell 7,000 homes for $2.8 billion to institutional investors, as it looked to unload its portfolio of properties. Some of those sales would be for below the purchase price, Bloomberg said.\n\n&gt;Barton didn\u2019t confirm or deny the numbers in the Bloomberg report. He told CNBC that the company has always sold to those types of buyers since entering the market, and he acknowledged that Zillow does have properties that it needs to sell. The company bought 3,805 houses in the second quarter and sold 2,086 in that period.\n\n&gt;\u201cWe\u2019re not in any kind of fire sale,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll wind down the inventory in an orderly way.\u201d\n\nSeems like the strategy of buying 80 cents for the dollar just to capture market shares has finally backfired.",

So I decided to look into the financial data myself, and determine just how reasonable or ridiculous Tesla's current valuation is. \n\nTo get a baseline for what an auto manufacturer's legitmate value should be, I decided to look at historical data for the 5 largest automotive companies today. I chose to examine data from 2010-2015, as that is the most recent time period in which the overall market was within one standard deviation above or below \"fair value\" on the Buffett Indicator. I then recorded each company's Market Capitalization and Earnings at the end of each year. \n\nI'm an idiot, so I decided I'd divide Earnings by Market Cap to find a ratio to determine what Tesla's earnings *should* be given their current valuation. I came to realize later that this is essentially the P/E ratio, but inversed. If any fellow smoothies didn't know (like me), P/E ratio is calculated by dividing the current share price of a stock by its EPS (earnings per share), however you can also calculate it by dividing the company's total Market cap by their total earnings, which I did the inverse of. Anyways, the math still functions the same for my intended purpose. \n\nI calculated that the largest auto manufacturers earned an average of 8%-28% of their valuations back when the market was most fairly valued, according to the Buffett Indicator. So, in order for Tesla to be fairly valued at $1.2 Trillion, they should be earning about $107 Billion to $343 Billion each year. In the past 5 years, Tesla earned an average of -0.83% of their market cap with their most recent earnings around $3 Billion.\n\nFor reference, the highest recorded earnings of any company in history was $114 Billion by the oil company Saudi Aramco in 2018. As another reference, Apple's highest ever yearly earnings was $61 Billion, also in 2018.  \n\nIf Tesla was a literal money printer that costs $1,200 and prints $3/year, it'd take 400 years to be profitable. Even if it ramps up the printing, it would still take ages. But hey, putting a car in space was kinda cool.\n\nSource: https://companiesmarketcap.com",

        "selftext": "p.s. mods I hope my autistic post meets all requirements.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSup. Made some gains in the past two weeks.  \n\n\nIt all started when I heard about the Gamestop fiasco. I pretty much started investing after the larger squeeze, so as you can imagine, I ended up bagholding and lost money. Now, after discovering options, I became slightly addicted and lost around 30k over the course of the year, transferring little by little from my bank account to RH. Pic related.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e0c5d1ytnox71.png?width=1112&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4a6f43a71df2d9ae0a3fd513487d2598bb963e6\n\nNow, I am down to my last 4.4k, what do I do with it? I gamble it on options of course! Little did I know, Hertz made an announcement to purchase Tesla vehicles. I just woke up to go to work and seen Tesla was rising. Here's the purchase and sells for that.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sydwpsu5qox71.png?width=2166&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6978d7dbef473cf6bff7c69067c43d41e291276d\n\nShit man! I had some fucking money! I made all my losses back plus an extra 10k or so. I finally accomplished something in my life! Why would I want it to end there though? I want more. So much more.  \n\n\nNvidia and SPY have been doing great as well so I started to buy calls for those as well.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kca4cu5csox71.png?width=1082&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=904f07848209847bb7dd0e936128a51e0f283064\n\nGolly gee! I'm high on a rush of gambling so I needed to continue. This put me at about 60k or so total. I took profit where I could and thats the way you should always play it.\n\nIt's not enough though. We gotta keep going don't we? It's NVIDIA time!  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p8mtg5w0tox71.png?width=2171&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8a66323c1bd2b8c4ba35dd6587a4c2c51809289\n\nIt is now November 3rd I have around 125000 in my RH account. Lifes good, but life can be great too. Here's where I YOLO this 100,000 to nearly make myself a millionaire.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j3be9y3rtox71.png?width=2146&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca2ce0731639b2ccf55bde373f51e5aa40106884\n\nIt happened. I made a shit ton of money. My dad didn't believe me. I didn't believe it. I'm glad I sold before the big dip today. Currently, my account is at:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vt6kuhzytox71.png?width=1094&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5cc2f147fb51c55278958befa9b546fe2c7d34ab\n\nBut peaked at \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ivatzc51uox71.png?width=1136&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e870da631a359c63ec339e781dd2f527092c9c9c\n\nI am just blown away. If it wasn't for WSB, shitposting, losing money, I would never have made this achievement. Can't forgot JPow either. Thanks!  \n\n\np.s. My current positions remaining are 100 310c 11/5 (down 64k) and 13 300c 11/5 (put 200 order in but didnt fill) I also am still holding SPY 400 266c 11/5.  \nSo, in 14 days, I raised my account by 680,000 for a 17,250% gain since Oct 5.\n\nIn between all of these options I did place some which either made so little difference or even lost money but overall I felt it didn't matter to put them in. Yes I couldve held some of the earlier ones longer for a way bigger profit, but sometimes you gotta take what you got and work with it.",

For example Apple's stock moves roughly $10-15 a month right now roughly. And if I buy a call with an expiration on May 5, 2022 with a strike of 125. I literally cannot lose, and I know that gets said alot but can someone really tell me that in about 6 months from now Apple's stock isn't going to move at all? It almost just seems to good to be true, I also thought well the profit is not great obviously because this is a very directional position wth little risk but is that's why people aren't buying these then simply just buy more contracts at the strike. Another things that seems to good is if lets say Apple's stock moves up $2 tommorow which is fairly common I can sell my position for roughly $200 already?

        "selftext": "I was inspired by u/Arcanon1 to share the story of my own massive loss porn. I believe it would be theraputic to me to write this out, and I hope some may learn from my mistakes of this year. There was no single yolo gone bad, rather it was the culmination of many mistakes along the way. \n\n\nIt all started with GME. I had an inherited portfolio of around $200,000, all of which was in mutual funds and highly diversified. I got into GME with $40,000 relatively early at $100 per share, at the peak squeeze my $40k turned to 200k, giving me a total of 400k.\n\n\nObviously the squeeze ended when they turned off the buy button, I ended up averaging down with another hundred shares or so, ended up selling it all at around $70, I was left with around $170k as you can see in the screenshot.\n\n\nMy next meme stock was Microvision. I rode that one from $12 all the way up to the high of $28. During the second MVIS peak of June, I had almost made it back up to $300,000, it then dipped below $20 and never came back. I became married to that stock, I averaged down and just continued to diamond hand into oblivion. It crushed my account. I ended up selling at $11. If I were still holding now, my net worth would be below 6 figures.\n\n\nAfter selling MVIS at $11, my average cost had become $15 and I had around a 25% loss. This brought me to around $130k. I bought CLF before the most recent earnings and got a sweet 15% profit from that. Up to $150k. Then I bought TDOC before earnings at $140, but my stop loss triggered at $130 the day after earnings, before it rocketed up to $150 without me. Back to $130k.\n\n\nI became tantalizingly close to riches with DWAC. I watched the legendary SPAC pump go from $10 rapidly to $15 and beyond, I had a 50k buy order set to trigger at $20, but at the last second, I said \"nah this is dumb\", and I cancelled the order. Had I not cancelled it, and held to the peak, I would have over half a million today.\n\n\nMissing DWAC caused me to FOMO hard. Recently, Black Rifle Coffee went public with a SPAC, I assumed it would do the same as DWAC, you know... conservative pumpers and all that. Ended up losing $10k from that. Down to $120k. \n\n\nMost recently I went all in on BGFV, bought at $28 and averaged up to $32, watched myself recover to $150k yesterday before a brutal 30% dump. And earlier this morning I got out, because enough YOLOing is enough for me. That was my breaking point. And viola! Thats how I got down to $110k.\n\n\nFrom now on, its a diversified portfolio of large caps for me, no more big high risk yolos. \n\n\nMy advice:\nDon't get married to a stock, if you're in a clear downtrend, get out. A small loss is better than a big loss.\n\nSet stop losses to lock in your profits, but dont set them too tight during volatile periods such as right after earnings\n\nDon't FOMO into retarded stuff. \n\nDon't average down, average up. \n\nAssume a stock going up will continue to go up, and one going down will continue down, don't try to time tops and bottoms. \n\n\n[Snapshots of my money throughout 2021](https://i.imgflip.com/5t4zp0.jpg)",

        "selftext": "Beyond Meat on Wednesday reported a widening loss in its third quarter as U.S. demand for its meat substitutes shrank and higher costs ate into its profits.\n\nThe company also disappointed investors with its fourth-quarter outlook, indicating that sales aren\u2019t expected to snap back immediately. Shares of the company tumbled 18% in extended trading.\n\nHere\u2019s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv:\n\nLoss per share: 87 cents vs. 39 cents expected\nRevenue: $106.4 million vs. $109.2 million expected\nBeyond reported fiscal third-quarter net loss of $54.8 million, or 87 cents per share, wider than a net loss of $19.3 million, or 31 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv expected a loss of 39 cents per share.\n\nThe company said it faced higher transportation and warehousing costs and increased its inventory write-offs, which hurt its profits. About $9 million was written off due to water damage at one of its plants, which mostly affected packaging.\n\nWATCH NOW\nVIDEO02:03\nBeyond Meat to launch chicken in select grocery stores\nNet sales rose 12.7% to $106.4 million, missing expectations of $109.2 million. Compared with the second quarter, its revenue fell, bucking typical seasonal trends for the company\u2019s products. Customers usually buy more Beyond Burgers during the summer to grill.\n\nThe company reported strong growth outside the United States, with international grocery and restaurant divisions each seeing sales more than double during the quarter.\n\nHowever, U.S. revenue fell 13.9% compared with a year ago, mostly due to weaker grocery demand. CEO Ethan Brown told analysts that grocery sales didn\u2019t help make up for shrinking food service orders, unlike in 2020.\n\nThe company also said softer demand and operational challenges, like severe weather, hurt its domestic sales. Brown said new competitors in the market are putting pressure on its market share, but data doesn\u2019t reveal that the lower demand is due to other companies stealing its customers. New products, like its meatless chicken, slightly offset U.S. sales declines.\n\nIn October, the company warned investors that it would be reporting weaker sales than it had previously predicted, citing a wide range of factors, including the delta variant and distribution problems.\n\nAnd the company\u2019s forecast doesn\u2019t indicate a sunnier fourth quarter. Beyond is predicting net sales of $85 million to $110 million for those three months. Wall Street was expecting revenue of $131.6 million during the quarter.\n\nBeyond said it\u2019s expecting some of the operational challenges from the third quarter to drag down its fourth-quarter results as well. It also cited restaurants\u2019 labor challenges and hesitant ordering behavior due to uncertainty tied to the pandemic as other factors embedded in the outlook. The company noted that the period contains 5 fewer shipping days than a year prior.\n\n\u201cNear-term market and operating conditions notwithstanding, we remain committed to our long-term strategy,\u201d Brown said in a statement.\n\nHe told analysts he is feeling optimistic about 2022. He hinted at new product launches coming next year, saying that some of those items could reach price parity with meat.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/beyond-meat-bynd-q3-2021-earnings.html",

        "selftext": "Jerome Powell, who guided the Federal Reserve and the nation\u2019s economy through the staggering and sudden Covid-19 recession by implementing unprecedented monetary stimulus, has been nominated for a second term as chairman of the U.S. central bank.\n\nPresident Joe Biden made the announcement Monday morning following weeks of speculation that a push from progressives might see Fed Governor Lael Brainard get the spot.\n\nBrainard instead will be vice chair of the board of governors; she had been widely expected to get a separate vice chair for supervision post, which oversees the nation\u2019s banking system. As vice chair, she would succeed Richard Clarida, whose term expires Jan. 31, 2022.\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve said before, we can\u2019t just return to where we were before the pandemic, we need to build our economy back better, and I\u2019m confident that Chair Powell and Dr. Brainard\u2019s focus on keeping inflation low, prices stable, and delivering full employment will make our economy stronger than ever before,\u201d Biden said in a statement.\n\nThe nominations next head to the Senate for confirmation.\n\nIn making the decision, Biden praised the Powell Fed for its \u201cdecisive\u201d action in the early days of the pandemic.\n\nThe Fed rolled out an unprecedented array of lending programs while also cutting interest rates back to near zero and instituting a monthly bond-buying program that would increase the central bank\u2019s holdings of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities by more than $4 trillion.\n\n\u201cChair Powell has provided steady leadership during an unprecedently challenging period, including the biggest economic downturn in modern history and attacks on the independence of the Federal Reserve,\u201d a White House statement said. \u201cDuring that time, Lael Brainard \u2013 one of our country\u2019s leading macroeconomists \u2013 has played a key leadership role at the Federal Reserve, working with Powell to help power our country\u2019s robust economic recovery.\u201d\n\nThough Powell carried the day, it was not without controversy.\n\nThe Fed has been under fire lately following an ethics scandal in which multiple officials engaged in trading stocks at a time when the institution was implementing policies aimed at boosting markets. Powell disclosed that he owned municipal bonds, which the Fed also was buying, and he also bought and sold funds tied to the broad stock market indexes.\n\nAt the same time, the Fed has been hit with inflation running faster than it had anticipated \u2013 in fact, at the sharpest pace in 30 years. Official Fed policy since September 2020 has been to let inflation run somewhat hotter than the standard 2% target if it allows for full and inclusive employment, but prices have been rising well above that level.\n\nPowell has held to the line that inflation will cool off once factors associated with the pandemic return to normal. But the recent readings have raised questions about the so-called average inflation targeting that signaled a historic turn in central bank monetary policy.\n\nThe inflation also has come with a rapid economic recovery and a decline in the unemployment rate from a pandemic peak of 14.8% to its current 4.6%.\n\nThe White House statement said the recovery is \u201ca testament to the success of the President\u2019s economic agenda, and it is a testament to decisive action by Chair Powell and the Federal Reserve to cushion the impact of the pandemic and get America\u2019s economy back on track.\u201d\n\nBrainard emerged as a key force in the race over who would carry the Fed through the next four years. She has taken point on several issues important to the Biden administration, particularly the need for the Fed to brace the banking system against disruptive climate change events.\n\nA former undersecretary of the Treasury during the Obama administration, Brainard also has been a strong proponent of a digital dollar.\n\nThe White House statement stressed the importance of progressive for the Fed in the years to come.\n\nBiden said that Powell and Brainard \u201calso share my deep belief that urgent action is needed to address the economic risks posed by climate change, and stay ahead of emerging risks in our financial system.\u201d\n\n\u201cFundamentally, if we want to continue to build on the economic success of this year we need stability and independence at the Federal Reserve \u2013 and I have full confidence after their trial by fire over the last 20 months that Chair Powell and Dr. Brainard will provide the strong leadership our country needs,\u201d he added.\n\nPolitical pressure, and a Covid struggle\nPresident Donald Trump appointed Powell to the position in 2018 in somewhat of a surprise. Trump chose to pass over then-Chair Janet Yellen, an unusual move in that Fed leaders are rarely removed after just one term. Former President Barack Obama initially appointed Powell to a 14-year term as governor in 2014.\n\nThough Trump nominated Powell, he later fired withering criticism at the Fed chief when the central bank raised interest rates seven times in 2017 and 2018. The former president went as far as to call the Fed policymakers \u201cboneheads\u201d for trying to normalize policy as the economy recovered.\n\nAs for Brainard, she is now widely expected to be named vice chair of supervision, a key Fed post to oversee the nation\u2019s banking system.\n\nThe Fed is empowered by Congress to fulfill two mandates: Maximize U.S. employment and keep inflation stable. Its leaders, known as governors, are nominated by the president and vote on how to adjust interest rates, regulate the nation\u2019s largest banks and monitor the health of the economy.\n\nTo combat the spike in unemployment and recession that began in the spring of 2020, the central bank slashed interest rates and began buying some $120 billion in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities every month. It also instituted a variety of lending programs aimed at keeping fixed income markets functioning after they endured significant stress at the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nEconomists credit that quick and sizable response for stabilizing financial markets and later repressing long-term interest rates. Lower interest rates make it easier for corporations to take on loans to build new factories, or for individuals to buy homes or cars. \n\n\u201cUnder Powell the Fed has placed more emphasis on having the economy operate at maximum employment,\u201d Mike Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan, said via email.\n\n\u201cThis is a goal progressive economists have long advocated and a goal which is presumably consistent with Biden\u2019s agenda.\u201d  \n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen, one of Biden\u2019s top economic advisors and a counselor on his Fed nominations, told CNBC earlier this month that she is happy with the Fed chief\u2019s work. Yellen was the first woman to serve as the Fed\u2019s chair and is the country\u2019s first female Treasury secretary. \n\n\u201cI talked to him about candidates and advised him to pick somebody who is experienced and credible,\u201d Yellen said. \u201cI think that Chair Powell has certainly done a good job.\u201d \n\nPowell is also popular on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have praised his leadership and amiability since he took over for Yellen in February 2018. \n\nThe news is likely a disappointment to progressives including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who said in September that the Fed\u2019s role in relaxing banking regulations in recent years makes Powell a \u201cdangerous man\u201d and that she would oppose his renomination.",

When the Twit\u00adterati duly voted for him to dump shares in the elec\u00adtric-car maker, that con\u00adfused the ques\u00adtion of whether this is an in\u00adsider sig\u00adnal about the share price.\n\nPer\u00adhaps Mr. Musk thinks that it\u2019s in\u00adsane that Tesla added $440 bil\u00adlion to its value in the past month alone, a rise\u2014just the rise, not the to\u00adtal\u2014equiv\u00ada\u00adlent to the com\u00adbined mar\u00adket cap\u00adi\u00adtal\u00adiza\u00adtion of Ford, Gen\u00aderal Mo\u00adtors and Toy\u00adota.\n\u2026\nTesla sits at the in\u00adter\u00adsec\u00adtion of three strong trends, and a change in any one of them could lead to a rapid fall back in the stock.\u00a0\n\nThe first are meme stocks. Tesla is the orig\u00adi\u00adnal meme stock, sup\u00adported by in\u00addi\u00advid\u00adu\u00adals who\u2019ve done very well by fol\u00adlow\u00ading Mr. Musk, and who don\u2019t take kindly to any\u00adone who dis\u00adagrees. No mat\u00adter the re\u00adal\u00adity of sales, com\u00adpe\u00adti\u00adtion, mar\u00adgins, sub\u00adsi\u00addies or any\u00adthing else, Mr. Musk has at\u00adtracted sup\u00adport\u00aders who not only buy, but ac\u00adtively pro\u00admote Tesla shares.\n\nThe sec\u00adond is the will\u00ading\u00adness of in\u00advestors to bet on the far dis\u00adtant fu\u00adture. Tesla doesn\u2019t make very much money, or in\u00addeed very many cars, at the mo\u00adment. It is val\u00adued at $1.3 mil\u00adlion for each of the 900,000 or so cars it is fore\u00adcast to de\u00adliver this year be\u00adcause of the po\u00adten\u00adtial for growth. The value of the com\u00adpany doesn\u2019t lie in this year or next year\u2019s sales, but on hopes for sales and prof\u00adits far in the fu\u00adture\u2026\n\nThe third sup\u00adport\u00adive trend is the de\u00adsire for green tech\u00adnol\u00adogy. It\u2019s great to be an elec\u00adtric-car maker at the mo\u00adment. Gov\u00adern\u00adments are push\u00ading elec\u00adtric cars and the rest of the in\u00addus\u00adtry is stuck with the wrong sort of fac\u00adto\u00adries, has the wrong sort of re\u00adsearch ex\u00adper\u00adtise and hasn\u2019t yet built ve\u00adhi\u00adcle-charg\u00ading net\u00adworks. Tesla is on the right side of gov\u00adern\u00adments and in\u00advestors pledg\u00ading ac\u00adtion to re\u00adduce car\u00adbon emis\u00adsions. Yet, if the share price change was about Tesla beat\u00ading the gaso\u00adline-fu\u00adeled com\u00adpe\u00adti\u00adtion, the shares of tra\u00addi\u00adtional ri\u00advals should be suf\u00adfer\u00ading. In\u00adstead, the value of the other car mak\u00aders has been ris\u00ading too. It would be great if the stock were do\u00ading well be\u00adcause in\u00advestors ra\u00adtio\u00adnally worked out that elec\u00adtric cars will take mar\u00adket share. In\u00adstead, there has been an un\u00adthink\u00ading rush to buy stock in elec\u00adtric-ve\u00adhi\u00adcle mak\u00aders, with many of the spec\u00adu\u00adla\u00adtive pure-elec\u00adtric-ve\u00adhi\u00adcle stocks that fell hard from a peak early this year leap\u00ading again in the past month (and Ford, with a new elec\u00adtric F-150 on the way, soar\u00ading).\u201d\n\nSource (James Mackintosh): https://www.wsj.com/articles/own-tesla-stock-be-like-elon-musk-and-sell-11636462480?st=n4vpidtxcyp9454&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share",

        "selftext": "Greetings, lads. Elon\u2019s TweetThreats and PP posts aside, EV stocks are melting faces this month. Consider the following\u2026\n\n* Rivian IPO blew up. Share price $110. Now $98B market cap.\n* Tesla +120% since May. SP $1,190. Now $1.2T MC.\n* Lucid +100% in three weeks. SP $52. Now $86B MC.\n\nLike you, SoFi didn\u2019t fill my $RIVN IPO order. Nor did I catch the $LCID  $15 dip. And sadly, I wasn\u2019t able to get in on $TSLA at $40 two years  ago.\n\nBut here\u2019s our chance for an early entry into one of the only EV \u201cpure plays\u201d in the market:\n\nPolestar \u2014 Volvo\u2019s EV spinoff brand \u2014 estimates 2021 revenue of $1.2B and 29,000 vehicles on the road.\n\nIt\u2019s now coming to market at a $20B valuation with $GGPI in Q1 2022.\n\nPolestar is the only global EV \u2018pure play,\u2019 other than Tesla.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/av4nl8i87d181.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68f1d78905547fea74ffaba96cd6265c7a4a33a8\n\n**History**\n\nA little background\u2026\n\n* \u201cPolestar\u201d takes its name from the North Star, or Polaris \u2014 not the resourceful co-ed grinding the early-evening shift at the Spearmint Rhino. That\u2019s *Polstj\u00e4rnan* (literal translation, \u201cPole Star\u201d) if you\u2019re Swedish.\n* Polestar was started in 1996 by Volvo\u2019s partner, Flash/Polestar Racing.\n* Volvo acquired Polestar in 2015. Volvo had itself been acquired in 2010 by Geely, a China-based auto brand that sells vehicles under the brands Geely Auto, Lotus, Lynk &amp; Co, Proton, and Volvo. Geely sold over 2.4 million cars in 2020.\n* Volvo and Geely describe the Polestar brand as being \u201cindependent since 2017.\u201d\n* Polestar is co-owned by Volvo and Geely, and headquartered in Gothenburg, Sweden.\n* Polestar is now being taken public at a $20B valuation by the Gores-Guggenheim, ticker GGPI.\n\n**Comps**\n\n**GGPI is trading at a significant discount to TSLA and LCID, based on EV/sales multiples.**\n\n* Applying Tesla\u2019s 2023E multiple to Polestar implies a share price of $42.51 As GGPI is currently trading at $13.72, this yields an increase of 210%.\n* Applying Lucid\u2019s 2023E multiple to Polestar implies a share price of  $47.58. As GGPI is currently trading at $13.72, this yields an increase  of 247%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vrmfi8ga7d181.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c0a7af961e3f7ee4e20df9747b005fbff44af7d\n\n**Peer Multiples -- EV Pure Plays**\n\n* GGPI is essentially valued at the same forward multiples as XPEV and NIO.\n* Bear in mind, XPEV and NIO are higher-risk companies that deserve valuation discounts because:\n\n1. The CCP can theoretically shut them down at any moment without warning (see: $DIDI).\n2. The stocks are actually ADRs and based in the Cayman Islands, so you don't even own the actual companies.\n\n* By comparison, GGPI is headquartered in Sweden and already US-listed on the Nasdaq.\n* Polestar is already an established OEM, leveraging the strategic relationship with Volvo in manufacturing, design and marketing. Hence, the investment   opportunity is lower risk since Polestar is not a start-up.\n* As with most present-day multinationals, there is some China-related production risk. However, Polestar is addressing the issue by opening US factories going forward.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n5mgt00e7d181.png?width=588&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7487924a42825ba052899aa03fc4fae3d1abe9ec\n\n**Gores' Deals**\n\nGores\u2019 track record speaks for itself\u2026\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t1uq0jcg7d181.jpg?width=1972&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6571264d9347fd8f8c237881e1d511b8cca7fae\n\n**The EV Graveyard**\n\nThe EV battlefield is littered with bodies.\n\nBut Polestar?\n\nThey've   been executing all year and have already delivered 29,000 cars. How  many deliveries of the first-gen Roadsters had Tesla made in 2010 when  they IPO\u2019d? Answer: 1,400.\n\nPolestar just makes cars, baby.\n\nCEO Thomas Ingenlath: \u201cWe have a proven track record. We actually deliver cars. We have 29,000 deliveries this year.\u201d\n\nClaim confirmed.

It\u2019s a hybrid premium sports car that will set you back $155K\u2026 619 horsepower, 738 lbs of torque, 0-60 in 3.8 seconds and clears the quarter mile in 12.0 seconds at 119.1 mph.

Polestar 2\u2026 What is it?\n\nThink Subaru Outback meets the Model 3 \u2014 with a dash of the minimalist Swedish aesthetic. It\u2019s a sedan, but its higher ride- height and rugged body make it seem more like a crossover. It opens like a   hatchback.

        "selftext": "**BUY PayPal stock now** \n\nPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL)  price was beaten down after a series of events and yesterday the CEO has delivered a weak guidance despite announcing the partnership with Amazon. They are well established, and they have a solid track record with big growth potential. With the current price, it offer investor a better opportunity to enter into the stock and potentially to buy at a lower price. \n\n**Lets take a look at PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL)** \n\n**Financial Health - no issue** \n\nLiabilities - debt to equity ratio of 42.8% (Total debt 8,945 Million / Total Equity 20,905 Million) as at June 30, 2021. *As interest rate is low, it is an excellent strategy to take on more debts to have more rooms for business expansion.* \n\nDebt Coverage - PayPal is well covered by operating cash flow (64%)\n\nInterest Coverage - PayPal's interest payments on debts are well covered by EBIT (24.7x coverage) \n\nCash &amp; Short term investments USD$12.4 billion \n\n**Earnings - Positive Earning Trend** \n\nTheir profit margin have been growing from 5.2% in year 2014 to 20.4% in year 2021. They have grown significantly by an average of 25% per year over the past 5 years.\n\nHigh ROE - 23.3% (ROE indicates how well a company's management deploys shareholder capital). \n\n**Ownership breakdown** \n\nInstitutions make up 82% of majority of ownership and general public of 17.9% . Big institutional / fund house such as Vanguards, Blackrock, state street global advisors are the top shareholders holding majority of the shares.\n\n**Future - Partnership with Amazon**\n\n PayPal said it had inked a deal with Amazon to allow the firm\u2019s Venmo wallets in the U.S. to be accepted on Amazon\u2019s website and mobile app starting next year. Amazon being the largest e-commerce in the world, has **300 million active users** as of (1 November 2021) and **162 million active users** are from US.  Due to Amazon\u2019s global scope and reach, it is also considered one of the most valuable brand worldwide. This also means that PayPal got to access to Amazon users and the payments can be done through PayPal's Venmo wallets. This is going to be the biggest revenue source going forward. \n\n**Digitalization  - convenience is part of us now after Covid19** \n\nEven economies are re-opening, we are every much used to digitalization where we find convenience in purchasing groceries and items online. Even the economy are open, my family and I still find these habits are to stay, we don't physically go to the stores and pick up items that often because I find (1) the prices online are usually more competitive, (2) I do not need to carry large bulky items home (3) whatever I sees in the stores, I will be able to buy online, so if I am not in a rush, I will still get my items online. My family did the same too. \n\nWith Covid19, it had sped up our pace of digitalization, the baby boomer and generation X who are usually not good with computers and mobile applications are forced to use online payments to minimized human contact. Once they got hold of it, the habits are to stay. My mother had learnt to order Amazon Prime for groceries have been very happy with it, she commented that she got competitive prices like other supermarket, and most importantly, the groceries are delivered right to the doorstep without her going out and carrying the items home which she had to persuade my brother to go with her to help her in carrying. Even economy are opening up, she is still going to continue to do that as she had found the conveniences and comfort of online shopping. And prior to Covid19, even amazon prime was around, she had refused to learn to shop online. \n\n**Forward guidance Vs potential** \n\nI will think the forward guidance from the CEO, Dan Schulman, is an overstatement.

        "selftext": "Believe it or not I still have some money left to lose, so let\u2019s go. This one is straightforward. Pinterest reports earnings today. The stock has already been beaten down a lot after last earnings and the failed PayPal acquisition rumor. However, I think their data looks really weak and there\u2019s some space for a further drop. It\u2019s a dangerous play however, since Pinterest already dropped something like 25% during their last earnings call. Proceed with caution.\n\nAnalysts will be watching Pinterest\u2019s user number very closely. If they don\u2019t manage to reverse the MAU drop they experienced during the last earnings call, things could still get uglier. \n\n**Weak website hits**\n\nIn every single one of the countries it\u2019s active in, Pinterest has suffered a drop in website views since April. The biggest drops came from European countries, but US suffered as well. In October, views were basically steady from September, and the biggest drops came during the month of June, with Q3 being slightly more stable m-o-m. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n53wgzh6llx71.png?width=481&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7168ee3ae26d0a6b80057c05cfa980a3c0e0a8bb\n\n**Weak app downloads**\n\nApp downloads also have decreased a lot, with steady decreases across 2021, and also a pretty sudden recent drop. The pattern kind of reminds me of Wish, which had a similar sudden drop in app downloads, right before they announced during earnings that they were halting marketing aimed at new customers. Not saying Pinterest will suffer a similar fate, but it\u2019s notable how its rankings are at an extremely low level compared even to pre-pandemic levels. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9fdr3547llx71.png?width=531&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=584ae048cd6709b3eed454ebabf3c7981798d564\n\n**Positions**",

        "selftext": "This DD is going to be quick and theoretical, and maybe less DD than some people like. I don't care. Your loss. One of the potential greatest earnings beats of all time is coming 11/10 (quick discussion [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pawnga/opendoor_is_on_pace_to_blow_away_q3_estimates/)). This is on top of a stupid discount with the stock being coupled to $ZG's downfall. This will de-couple.   \n\n\nKeith Rabois: PayPal mafia, Musk and Thiel friend, edgy fuck-you attitude online. This man is somehow so under talked about in this thread and is one of the kings of tech and Twitter. Keith should be a legend of this sub. He is right time after time. He doesn't care about discourse. He just executes. Opendoor has been his long time baby, which he has waited to start to get the timing right. Co-founder, now executive chairman, and a Twitter account that is tweeting out borderline NMPI.   \n\n\nLongterm, $OPEN is going to have similar / greater top line numbers as Walmart. People are concerned about a downturn in the housing market being non-survivable. Wrong. The model has been back-tested through the 2008 crisis and beyond. Opendoor can still make money. The collapse in housing markets are much slower than you want to believe, and with the right vertical model in place, Opendoor can make money while losing a couple of basis points. They are so misunderstood, and this is the discounted time to join.  \n\n\nOpendoor has an actual model. They understand how to price homes and when to pull on/off on different regions, and they don't overreact to the market to end up fucked by 700 basis points ala Zillow. Opendoor also doesn't have the same fiduciary responsibility that Zillow does. They have to (and are) making this model work. Zillow simply had to pull out for two reasons: 1) they didn't know what they were doing. 2) they owed a fiduciary responsibility to the shareholders to quit while they can and focus on their main model (which will also get swallowed in the coming years). This is now Opendoor's market to run with. Google ($OPEN) vs Yahoo.  \n\n\nTo the tweets. Rabois is addicted to Twitter. Similar to Elon, but different. In some ways more professional, in some ways more unhinged and quite a few red pilled based takes. Anyways, he's been obsessed with tweeting Q3 takes, while searching and favoriting $OPEN tweets, and engaging in discussion. He calls doubters stupid in public. Here are a few from the past few weeks:  \n\n\n1. \"Opendoor does not lose money.\" [here](https://twitter.com/rabois/status/1450115678346924038?s=20)\n2. \"wait until Nov 10 and you will concede I was correct\" [here](https://twitter.com/rabois/status/1453880268851404806?s=20)\n3. \"nope.  TKO.  Opendoor is doing better than ever.\" [here](https://twitter.com/rabois/status/1449792434062438406?s=20)\n4. \"they are going to look like the Tesla cynics in 3 weeks.\" [here](https://twitter.com/rabois/status/1449787713394253825?s=20)\n5. \"Selling or shorting Opendoor due to Zillow\u2019s flaws is akin to shorting Google due to Yahoo\u2019s inability to monetize search well or return long tail queries properly.\" [here](https://twitter.com/rabois/status/1455564619494436870?s=20) \n   1. Note here: short numbers that kicked in after the Zillow earnings are not public yet, and will not be public before earnings. Give the action a look and you'll see a bunch of shorts likely kicked up, and will be put in a need to cover position based off the earnings and a longer short ratio.\n6. \"LOL.  We are consistently profitable.  We know exactly what we are doing.\" [here](https://twitter.com/rabois/status/1449783187656355846?s=20)  \n\n\nThis is more than just pre-bragging earnings. Chairmen and founders used to be more discreet by taking lavish vacations before earnings. Then Michael Jung from NYU published research to connect behavior to upcoming releases and it all stopped. Keith is straight up dancing in public. He's celebrating Zillow taking a beating. He's also publicly called Zillow becoming a disaster [from the archives](https://twitter.com/rabois/status/984609468355719168?s=20).\n\nAnalysts like Opendoor. The cap table is ELITE. Real Estate agents provide negative value in a broken industry., which leads me to one final point. The effects of the tech industry and Keith's pinned tweet which he bases his career on:  \n\n\n&gt;***Formula for startup success: Find large highly fragmented industry w low NPS; vertically integrate a solution to simplify value product.*** \n\n  \niBuying is just the entry. Cash flow heavy, with a potential to open up a MASSIVE vertical moat. Open has already completed 2 acqui-hires this year. This is a $5TN company in the making and it's currently valued at \\~$13BN.   \n\n\nIf you're an agent in the industry and are mad about Opendoor, don't come in and say it won't work. You're wrong. Take your massive winning year and hedge against your job being automated away. You'll get to retire even sooner. This is the way.",

        "selftext": "Current Price $231.50 \nMarket Cap $271 B\n52 Week High $310.16\n52 Week Low $174.81\n\nPayPal is growing a comprehensive platform to power the global digital economy. PayPal is constantly improving its product to meet the needs of their customers. The app was updated in September with a plethora of new features with the hopes of turning it into a super app. Venmo is now offering goods and service payment, and cry.pto currency is now available for you to buy/sell. The fees are even cheaper than Coinbase on a $150 or less purchase. \n\nPositive things about PayPal \n\n1. Updated App in September\n2. Venmo revenue growing every quarter \n3. Buy Now Pay Later option added\n4. Venmo is now offering goods and services option \n5. Honey acquisition is now being utilized on Venmo \u201cDEALS\u201d feature. \n6. Aquired Paidy in September. It\u2019s a Japanese Unicorn. Great acquisition. A Japanese leader. This will increase marker share. \n7. PayPal savings account is coming soon. Earn interest and watch your money grow. No minimum amount needed. \n8. Cry.pto part of their business has taken off. PayPal/Venmo has 2x as many active users than Coinbase. And it\u2019s only been around since April. \n\nI feel the cry.pto part of their business has been overlooked. Bit.coin is at all time high, and I\u2019m sure the ability to buy it on PayPal/Venmo has only helped it get there. \n\nLook for PayPal to use some of its cash reserves 11-12B to acquire companies over the next 12 months OR aggressively buy back shares. \n\nPayPal is revolutionizing how we do business/finance online. If you own a small business (like I do) and you sell a product/service online you most likely get paid in paypal. It\u2019s the king. Millennials prefer to use Venmo, and boomers use paypal. By getting involved in the buy now pay later space they are taking advantage of one of the hottest markets to be in. \n\n\nThe Pinterest news caused an initial drop in stock price, and then PayPals denial of the purchase of Pinterest brought it down even more. This is an incredibly opportunity to buy the dip. No bad news has came out about PayPal. I know it\u2019s not the next Tesla, or some sexy small cap EV company. But, this is a FANTASTIC company with LOADS of potential over the next 12 months. The king of online payments. Building a super app. Earnings are next Monday. I am super excited to see the results. I expect them to MURDER earnings. \n\nThis is not financial advise. I\u2019m just a dumb ape. \ud83e\udda7[Pictures of some DD. ](https://gyazo.com/4128aa1775f917ad990cee26da474882)",

        "selftext": "Good morning fellow apes; I\u2019m here to tell you about Micron Technology and answer a few questions: what is it, why is it trending, and is there a future for it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHAT IS MU?**\n\n**Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: MU)** is an American producer of computer memory and computer data storage. This includes DRAM (dynamic random-access memory), flash memory, and USB flash drives. Its consumer products are marketed under the brands Crucial and Ballistix. Micron and Intel together created IM Flash Technologies, which produces NAND flash memory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHY IS MU TRENDING ON** r/wallstreetbets**?**\n\nEvercore Fundamental Research Analyst C.J. Muse boosted to his firm\u2019s \u201cTop Picks\u201d list last week. He argues that MU could benefit from the \u201cgreen shoots\u201d he\u2019s seeing in the memory industry.\n\nEven though MU lost 1.3% since the start of June (and competitor Lam has fallen 0.8%, while the Semiconductor index has increased 22.8% in the same time frame), Muse confidently states that \u201c..it is clear that the tides are shifting, with pricing decline expectations into 1HCY22 becoming \u2018less bad,\u2019 estimates likely bottoming in 1H22, and green shoots arising from PC constraints elsewhere easing, and hyperscale capex spend likely improving before year end. Thus, we think it is game on for memory.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom an investor positioning perspective, we note investors are generally eager to get back into memory for anticipated outperformance in 2022 but are not there today,\u201d Muse wrote. \u201cSo when the turn comes, we think it will be fast and furious.\u201d\n\nApart from EverCore, there are other financial analysts who believe MU is poised to take advantage of the future of memory. Citi analyst Christopher Danely notes that the firm's DRAM analyst Peter Lee recently raised his DRAM pricing expectations for Q4 of 2021 and Q1 of 2022, driven mostly by upside from the PC end market, which led the DRAM correction. Channel checks indicate there has been some upside from the PC market for DRAM and demand from the server end market for Q1 of 2022 appears to be better than expected, Danely tells investors in a research note. As such, the analyst expects \"more positive catalysts\" for DRAM in the coming months and initiated a \"positive catalyst watch\" on Buy-rated Micron. He expects the stock to trade higher as investors gain more confidence the DRAM correction \"is drawing to a close.\" Danely keeps a $120 price target on the stock, currently trading just north of $80 a share.  \n \n\nAfter the two above reports became public, the market started to react. MU recently started trending as one of the top 3 most mentioned tickers on r/wallstreetbets, beating out PayPal, Tilray, Amazon, and Aurora.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**THE FUTURE OF MEMORY AND MU**\n\nThe memory-chip market hit the skids in the second half of 2018 when sales of smartphones, personal computers, servers and other gear slowed. But memory-chip sales rebounded in late 2020.\n\nBoise, Idaho-based Micron makes two main types of memory chips: DRAM and Nand. Dynamic random-access memory, or DRAM, accounted for 74% of Micron's revenue in its fiscal fourth quarter. Nand flash memory accounted for 24% of its revenue during the period.\n\nDRAM chips act as the main memory in PCs, smartphones and other devices, working closely with central processing units. Nand flash provides longer-term data storage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHAT IS DRAM?**\n\nNormal RAM is a semiconductor that is placed on a processor that stores variables for calculations. RAM provides memory locations for requested data. The CPU receives a data read instruction with the data\u2019s memory address or location, and then it sends the address to the RAM controller.\n\nThe controller, in turn, sends the address to the proper pathway, opening path transistors and reading each capacitor value. The read data is transmitted back to the CPU\u2019s cache.\n\nThe speed of this read/write operation is important to know about. They are called timings: faster timings with less lag between them result in faster access times. Slower timings result in lower performance. Bandwidth also affect performance: the larger the bandwidth, the more data per second RAM can process and the faster the timings.\n\nBasically, if you want the best SSD for your buck, you want to know if you are getting something with fast timings or slow timings.. namely, SRAM or DRAM.\n\n   \n\n* SRAM has lower access time, and is faster whereas DRAM has a higher access time and is slower compared to SRAM.\n* SRAM users transistors and latches while DRAM uses capacitors and very few transistors.\n* L2 and L3 CPU cache units are some general applications of a SRAM while the DRAM is mostly found as the main memory in computers.\n* SRAM offers low packaging density while DRAM offers a high packaging density.\n* SRAM is in the form of on-chip memory, but DRAM has the characteristics of off-chip memory.\n\nIn short, DRAM uses very few transistors, has the characteristics of off chip memory, and is available in larger storage capacity\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ADVANTAGES OF DRAM**\n\n* Cheaper compared to SRAM.\n* It has a higher storage capacity. Hence it is used to create a larger RAM space system.\n* Offers simple structure.\n* It doesn\u2019t require to refresh the memory contents.\n* You don\u2019t need to refresh the memory contents and its access time is faster.\n* Logic or circuitry is needed, so the memory module itself is simpler.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY**\n\nWorldwide sales of semiconductors in Q3 2021 were $144.8 billion, an increase of 27.6% over Q3 2020 and 7.4% more than Q2 2021, reported by the Semiconductor Industry Association.\n\nJohn Neuffer, SIA president and CEO says \u201cSemiconductor shipments reached all-time highs in the third quarter of 2021, demonstrating both the ongoing high global demand for chips and the industry\u2019s extraordinary efforts to ramp up production to meet that demand.\u201d\n\nGlobal sales for the month of September 2021 were $48.3 billion, an increase of 27.6% over the total from September 2020 and 2.2% more than sales from August 2021.\n\nRegionally, year-to-year sales increased in the Americas 33.5%, Europe 32.3%, Asia Pacific/All Other 27.2%, Japan 24.5%, and China 24.0%.\n\nMonth-to-month sales increased in the Americas 3.9%, Europe 2.0%, Japan 2.0%, Asia Pacific/All Other 1.9%, and China 1.5%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ANALYSIS OF MU \u2013 CUP AND HANDLE**\n\nOn Nov. 6, MU started to break out of a cup-with-handle according to IBD MarketSmith charts. A three-weeks-tight pattern in late December offered an add-on buy point at 74.71.\n\nMicron stock has an **IBD Accumulation/Distribution Rating** of B-, indicating modest institutional buying of MU stock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[MU Cup and Handle](https://preview.redd.it/at41phf8ht081.png?width=623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74012005729ab7a8ded8e662cc9ff1ce85970c17)\n\nMicron wasn't directly affected by the chip shortage, since it manufactures its own chips instead of outsourcing them to third-party foundries. However, it expects shortages of other PC components -- including CPUs and GPUs -- to indirectly curb the market's near-term demand for its memory chips. That warning, along with a softer-than-expected forecast for the first quarter, spooked investors last month.\n\nDespite these challenges, analysts still expect Micron's revenue and earnings to rise 15% and 44%, respectively, this year, as it benefits from the secular expansion of the gaming, data center, cloud, 5G, and automotive markets. Those catalysts might also spark a \"super cycle\" in memory chip upgrades, which could last much longer than previous cycles and propel Micron's stock to fresh highs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**DISCLAIMER**\n\nThis is not financial advice.

My total loss is 9.49% right now, but at least I'm selling some covered calls to make some premium. It's currently trading around $231 and I was thinking of maybe buying some more here to bring down my cost basis even further. If I didn't own PYPL at all right now, I'd be buying like crazy right now. But since I've already bought three times already averaging down, I'm not sure I should buy more again now. I'm only down about 4.4% from my last buy. If it got to -10% from my last buy, I would definitely buy more at that point.

        "selftext": "Here are the final Parts 8-10, of an article addressing the main bear arguments on Paysafe.  Parts 1-7 covered Paysafe\u2019s outlook on growth, debt, and profit, along with insider ownership and competition.  I recommend starting with the [introduction in Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qkg3i5/gaining_visibility_on_paysafe_psfe/) (Growth), and following the links from there if still interested.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 8. Management\n\nAs part of Paysafe\u2019s preparations for the next phase of growth, the company has undergone a complete management overhaul. Along with replacing nearly all the Board of Directors, in the last two years, they\u2019ve hired a new CEO, new CFO, new CTO, new CIO, new CRO and new CISO. They\u2019ve hired PayPal\u2019s Chief Risk Officer and have also filled key division CEO positions with Facebook\u2019s Head of Payments and Amazon Intl\u2019s Head of Payments.  This does not sound like an operation with a passive outlook.\n\nStill, many are rightfully frustrated that management has done little publicly to support the share price since going public. Despite a steady supply of [positive news](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/oak2jx/paysafes_value_creation_trajectory_is_very_much/), the CEO has not once meaningfully engaged the media to highlight Paysafe\u2019s value story.  It may be that management is deliberately downplaying its messaging while shares move from short-term trader\u2019s hands to those of value-seeking funds in order to better secure long-term share value.  Or, they are simply focused on producing the numbers.\n\nRegardless, what management may lack in public storytelling, it makes up for in execution. In the short time since they went public, they have announced 3 new acquisitions and over 25 expanded partnerships with the likes of [Visa](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/skrill-usa-launches-skrill-virtual-visar-prepaid-card-in-us/), [Coinbase](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-issues-coinbase-s-new-visa-debit-card-enabling-easier-cryptocurrency-spending/), [Fubo Gaming](https://www.paysafe.com/eu-en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-streamlines-payments-for-interactive-wagering-with-fubo-gaming-in-us/), [FOXbet](https://www.njgamblingfun.com/nj/sports-news/paysafe-continues-its-push-into-online-gaming), [Golden Nugget](http://www.greensheet.com/newswire.php?newswire_id=53685), [Bankable](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-partners-with-bankable-to-provide-omnichannel-banking-services/), [Wix](https://www.pymnts.com/digital-payments/2021/smbs-can-accept-payments-with-paysafe-skrill-on-wix/), [Repay](https://www.repay.com/repay-partners-with-paysafe-to-enable-u-s-merchants-to-accept-online-cash-payments/), [WynnBet](https://www.electronicpaymentsinternational.com/news/wynnbet-taps-paysafe-for-payments-and-marketing-solutions/), [Betfred USA](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-expands-betfred-usa-sports-partnership-through-income-access-deal/), [OwnersBox](https://incomeaccess.com/contenthub/ownersbox-launches-affiliate-program/), [Dutch neobank bunq](https://www.paysafe.com/eu-en/paysafegroup/news/detail/bunq-partners-with-paysafe-to-enable-cash-deposits-for-digital-banking/), [IntelliPay](https://intellipay.com/paysafe-expands-us-partnership-with-intellipayto-offer-online-cash-payments/), Glory Ltd, Parx Interactive, TripGift, SweePay, SimplePayMe, [Smart Property Systems](https://globalfintechseries.com/banking/digital-payments/paysafe-partners-with-smart-property-systems-in-north-america/), Ambassador Cruise Line, Shelby Financial, ResponseCRM, ZEN, [Montana Lottery](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-powers-online-payments-for-montana-lotterys-sportsbook/), PlayUP, [SuperBook Sports](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-platform-launches-with-superbook-sports-in-colorado-and-new-jersey/) and [Bitrise](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-accelerates-innovation-with-bitrise-for-faster-digital-wallets-payments/).\n\nIn that same period, they\u2019ve also:\n\n* expanded their US launch of digital wallet Skrill to [48 states](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafes-skrill-expands-its-crypto-service/),\n* expanded their digital wallets to [trade](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafes-neteller-launches-fiat-to-crypto-withdrawal-service/) 38 \\[digital\\]currencies and 40 global fiat currencies\n* launched online cash payments on Microsoft\u2019s [Xbox](https://www.pymnts.com/news/payment-methods/2021/xbox-gamers-can-now-pay-with-cash-online-with-paysafe/) in 22 countries\n* struck deals with [Snowflake](https://www.atmmarketplace.com/news/paysafe-integrates-snowflake-to-power-cloud-based-approach-for-enhanced-customer-experiences/) and Amazon\u2019s [AWS](https://www.electronicpaymentsinternational.com/news/paysafe-partners-aws-to-become-cloud-based-payments-provider/) to support its migration to a cloud-based platform as part of their strategy to scale quickly and leverage data to drive customer acquisition,\n* [launched](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-launches-safeguarding-model-for-the-travel-industry-globally/) a new global travel safeguarding model,\n* a unique innovation that quickly led to a new [deal](https://www.paysafe.com/eu-en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-and-arc-partner-to-deliver-innovative-payments-solution-for-airlines/) with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally.\n\nAlso during this time, they announced the appointments of:\n\n* Digital wallet division CEO, [Chirag Patel](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-appoints-chirag-patel-to-lead-its-digital-wallets-division/) (fmr Head of Payments at Amazon Intl., Santander)\n* North American iGaming CEO, [Zak Cutler](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-appoints-zak-cutler-to-lead-its-north-america-igaming-business/) (fmr DraftKings exec),\n* Boardmember [Mark Brooker](https://fxnewsgroup.com/forex-news/executives/paysafe-appoints-mark-brooker-as-non-exec-director/) (fmr COO Betfair, non-exec dir. William Hill)\n\nAll that done while reporting a profitable quarter, beating on revenue and EPS consensus, reporting 41% total payment volume (TPV) growth, refinancing all debt for significant cost savings, after putting deals in place throughout North America to lead in any new iGaming market as soon as it opens (as just happened with their 100% positioning in Canada\u2019s [newly opened](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/canada-legalizes-single-game-sports-191629457.html) sports betting market).  As Bill Foley said, \u201cwe\u2019re seeding the future growth right now\u2026 The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective\u2026It\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\u201d  They have not slept on this promise even as they quietly lay the groundwork to do the same thing in South America.\n\nLastly, major shareholder and Paysafe Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley has repeatedly proven himself to be a trusted and highly effective deal maker with a remarkably consistent track record in growing shareholder value.  Bloomberg describes Foley as someone who prides himself on operating experience, who has a known talent for corporate maneuvering and brings with him a full team of seasoned financial managers.\n\nThe types of acquisitions described in Part 1 are central to Paysafe\u2019s \u201cvalue creation playbook\u201d which is exactly how Foley, grew FIS 36x from a market cap of $2.5 billion to over $90 billion. From the beginning of the deal to bring Paysafe public, Foley [said](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/user_upload/Foley-Trasimene-Acquisition-Corp-II-and-Paysafe-investor-call-Final.pdf), \u201cthose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe... FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe \u2013 an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell.\u201d\n\nIn this context, it\u2019s worth underscoring Foley\u2019s undeniably history of simultaneously growing multiple companies.  Over just the last six years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3x, Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6x, and Black Knight 8.7x. He\u2019s also known for growing Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion (3,600x). In all cases, he has significantly expanded their margins between 500 to 1800 bps. Foley said, \u201cMy whole history and career has been around acquiring companies and fixing companies.\u201d  Though he\u2019s not Paysafe\u2019s front man, his fingerprints are evident and IR has recently assured that \u201c  Bill is highly engaged with the company.\u201d Personally, I don\u2019t doubt it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 9. Lockup Expiration\n\nSome bears still point to PSFE overhang from lockups but all share lockups expired months ago, except for founder shares which constitute about 4% of outstanding shares ([20F p. 135](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1833835/000119312521104105/d159702d20f.htm#toc)). That lockup is expected to expire in December. Personally, lockup expiry of such a small percentage of shares is not deterring me from continuing to build a position before Paysafe starts reporting better numbers. This is especially true when those shares are controlled by Chairman Foley, who is central to Paysafe\u2019s value creation playbook. Between Foley\u2019s consistent track record, the proxy statement below and Blackstone\u2019s stance on future growth, all signs indicate a long-term hold.\n\nUpon approving the deal to bring Paysafe public, the founders identified \u201cbase returns for a four year hold period\u201d of \u201c2.9x to 3.8x\u201d from $10.  \n\nFrom their proxy statement (SEC filing-[DEFM14A](https://pdf.secdatabase.com/2681/0001193125-21-060961.pdf)): \u201cThe Business Combination could provide base returns for a four year hold period assuming exit multiples between 20-25x next twelve month EBITDA, reflecting a range of internal rate of return of 30.9% to 39.2% and a multiple on invested capital of 2.9x to 3.8x, in each case, based on the FTAC initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, while recognizing that the achievement of such returns could not be assured, and that the Business Combination has similar characteristics to other transactions involving Mr. Foley in the financial technologies industry, including an attractive platform with a defensible market position and multiple attractive acquisition opportunities to strengthen market position further, each of which made PGHL an attractive investment for FTAC.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 10. Valuation\n\nPaysafe is building an integrated architecture that is worth more than the sum of its parts.  By leveraging an asset-light cloud-based model to efficiently scale up in new high growth markets globally, Paysafe is a perfect example of the low capex Fintech profile that generally warrants high valuation multiples.\n\nNow trading around 4x a conservative F2022 revenue with nearly every institutional owner\u2019s cost basis 20-40% higher than the current price, it would appear PSFE is severely undervalued. Perhaps because Paysafe didn't go public via the traditional IPO method it is being lumped in with highly speculative pre-revenue ventures.  But Paysafe is anything but that.\n\nOr maybe the current low price is simply a reflection of broadly disseminated misleading information like the articles on debt quoted in Part 2 or like the several articles falsely claiming Paysafe went public at a 3x higher valuation above its 2017 take private price. Some articles claim this by mistaking British pounds for US dollars while a Yahoo Finance article claimed a \"300% higher\" valuation with bad math and a false comparison between enterprise value (inclusive of debt) and a misquoted 2017 market cap price of \u201c$3.7 billion\u201d, exclusive of debt.  Inclusive of debt (enterprise value), Paysafe was taken private for $4.7 billion, according to [Reuters.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/qfopku/credit_suisse_revised_to_neutral_detail/)  To make its bear case, that article misquotes the relevant 2017 take private value by a full billion dollars.\n\nInitially, I wondered why just about every bearish article relied on faulty or misleading information to make its valuation case, or why so many platforms misreported PSFE\u2019s financial data, like YF\u2019s overstating a Q1 EPS miss as -0.23 EPS instead of -0.05 (fixed months later); or why does a [Credit Suisse analyst](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/qfopku/credit_suisse_revised_to_neutral_detail/) offer new price targets 4 times in 5 months with the first change just two days after initiating coverage and the last change, to neutral, just two weeks before Q3ER.  Instead of waiting a few days for new data highly relevant to his thesis, the analyst cites, as if Q2 were a new revelation, months old information most of which was available before he first initiated coverage. (Coincidentally, he issued this two minutes before pre-market, precisely when PSFE was on the verge of breaking above the confluence of its 9-month downtrend resistance line and the 50DMA).  Negligence or intentional price manipulation, take your pick.  Skeptics may cringe at this idea but this is really nothing new.  It\u2019s not like the market is [unaware](https://www.sec.gov/tm/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsanalystshtm.html) of analyst [conflicts of interest](https://web.williams.edu/Economics/Honors/2004/MSirignanoThesis.pdf) or that Credit Suisse has shown itself to be an upstanding market participant (think lawsuit for misleading investors on [Archegos](https://fortune.com/2021/07/29/credit-suisse-report-archegos-loss-bank-massive-culture-problem/), [$5.3B fine](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/23/deutsche-bank-and-credit-suisse-agree-billion-dollar-fines-with-us-authorities.html) for mortgage backed securities,[$2.5B fine](https://cn.reuters.com/article/uk-creditsuisse-investigation-idUKKBN0E00WM20140520) after pleading guilty for aiding in tax fraud, and the recent [$547M fine](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/credit-suisse-resolves-fraudulent-mozambique-loan-case-547-million-coordinated-global) after admitting to regulatory breaches, secret loans, lying to authorities and spying on employees). On the other hand, this could be CS trying to clean up its act by playing it safe or an analyst trying to preserve his reputation by keeping price targets closer to market.  If so, this may have the flip-side benefit of future incremental upgrades.\n\nObviously, this is all conjecture, which really doesn\u2019t matter in the long run.\n\nTrue price discovery will take form as share rotation plays out and Paysafe's value story becomes clear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUntil then, here are a few reference points:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking at Paysafe\u2019s eCash segment as a separate company:\n\nThe eCash segment is a high margin business with over 12 million active users, $5 billion in volume, $405 million in TTM revenue and $157 million EBITDA. For H1/21, they just reported 49.4% YoY revenue growth and 81.6% YoY EBITDA growth. Not many Fintech companies can claim that.\n\nAdyen is a Fintech with a similar growth profile, (46% YoY revenue growth and 27% YoY EBITDA growth). Applying Adyen\u2019s 19x EV/rev ratio to Paysafe\u2019s eCash business alone, would give it a $7.6 billion enterprise value. That\u2019s close to the current valuation of the entirety of Paysafe, yet this one segment represents less than a third of total revenue.\n\nUsing Adyen\u2019s EV/EBITDA ratio of 149x would value Paysafe\u2019s eCash segment at $23.3 billion. Even when applying the company\u2019s entire debt to that one segment, the share price for just the eCash business alone would still be $26.62.\n\nAgain, that represents less than a third of Paysafe\u2019s total business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBrick &amp; Mortar Payment Processing\n\nPaysafe is a value play right now but bears focus on growth.  Paysafe has an established history of 27-30% CAGR but because recent growth was temporarily stifled by China de-risking exits and Covid-related closures, some equally hard-hit brick &amp; mortar payment processing partners, like Visa and Mastercard, offer an interesting comparison.\n\nFor 2020, Visa reported negative YoY revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%). Similarly, Mastercard reported negative YoY revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%). Their forward growth is projected to be 7.7% and 10% respectively. \n\nIn all forward growth metrics, including EBITDA and EPS, they do worse than Paysafe, yet they both trade at an EV/Rev multiple of roughly 24X.  This would put PSFE at $41.80.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDigital Wallet vs. Digital Wallet\n\nMany compare the #1 digital wallet, PayPal, to the #2 digital wallet, Paysafe, so, hopefully without striking a nerve, here\u2019s a deeper look into that comparison:\n\nAs noted earlier, Paysafe\u2019s stock was recently clobbered down 30% (to 3.2x P/S) on soft Q3 guidance even though they reaffirmed full year guidance and beat consensus on revenue and EPS.\n\nBy comparison, PayPal missed Q3 guidance for both revenue and EPS. PayPal was also reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance AND they missed on Q2 revenue consensus while also reporting a -23%YoY decline on EPS. PYPL only went down 10% (from a lofty 15x P/S) as news outlets characterized PayPal\u2019s troubles as a \u201cbuying opportunity.\u201d\n\nSome will reasonably say that\u2019s because PayPal has such strong growth history but, from the time PayPal\u2019s numbers were available separately from its parent eBay, 2012-2020, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR ([$5.6b](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal) to [$21.5b](https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/Q4-FY-20-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf)). In that same period, Paysafe has grown 30.5% CAGR ([$169m](https://www.investing.com/analysis/optimal-payments:-still-at-discount-despite-ebitda-growth-137908) to [$1.43b](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_60f30e3ae06e5db5459655316a65dc97/paysafe/db/1111/9761/file/Supplemental+Financial+Information_+Paysafe+Limited_+Q1+2021.xlsx)).\n\nPaysafe reported 27%CAGR prior to 2020\u2019s restructuring and, in just the last year, when excluding Paysafe\u2019s 2020 de-risking exits, they reported 23% YoY growth for Q2 which is on par with PayPal\u2019s recent report of 19% YoY growth. This comparative history serves only to show that Paysafe has a strong track record that should not be discounted.\n\nPaysafe is still priced as if it is a zero growth, pre-revenue speculative venture. Meanwhile, though some have called PayPal a \u201cfree cash flow machine,\u201d Paysafe already generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal (25% FCF margin vs. 20% FCF margin).\n\nThere\u2019s obviously more to this complex story but, for reference, below is PSFE potential share value when applying PYPL\u2019s multiples (now 25% off highs) when factoring in all of PSFE\u2019s potential acquisition debt and dilution:\n\n* PayPal\u2019s EV/FCF ratio of 66.9X puts PSFE at $33.10\n* PayPal\u2019s EV/EBITDA ratio of 44.3X puts PSFE at $24.90\n* PayPal\u2019s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X puts PSFE at $28.40.\n* PayPal\u2019s EV/Rev ratio of 12.4x puts PSFE at $20.75\n* PayPal\u2019s free cash flow yield of 1.7% puts PSFE at $29.41\n\nThose metrics average to a share price of $27.31\n\nWhen factoring in a potential 24% growth, 35% EBITDA margin, 75-80% FCF conversion, the potential share value climbs fairly quickly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSector multiples:\n\nBecause Paysafe is far more diversified than the average Fintech, a while back I compared it to a wide basket of Fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. Collectively, they have a \\~12.5% growth rate. Unlike Paysafe, a third of this group reported negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA and half reported negative EBITDA growth. Paysafe also currently has better EPS and a better Debt/EBITDA ratio than over half the group.\n\nAfter removing the top-end outliers in each category that put PSFE above $100 and discounting all by an additional 10%, here\u2019s Paysafe\u2019s share price with the averaged peer multiples:\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $45.67\n* EV/Rev ratio : $40.17\n* EV/FCF ratio : $39.72\n\nAverage : $41.84\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's worth pointing out here that, as happened with FIS\u2019s tremendous growth history, stock prices tend to temporarily pull back in association with acquisitions. This may explain some of PSFE\u2019s recent price action, but certainly not all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSure, it\u2019s easy to read all of the material in Parts 1-10 and say, \u201cthe market doesn\u2019t care,\u201d but I\u2019m confident that\u2019ll change when share rotation settles and quarterly ER\u2019s gradually shift focus from the past to the future.  Stripped of superficial misdirection, bear arguments often devolve down to variations of \u201clook at the chart\u201d and \u201cprice is truth.\u201d  This has been said about many companies in the past as they position themselves for future growth.\n\nNo, this is not the next Amazon but Bezos had it right when he said, \u201cThe stock is not the company. And the company is not the stock. ... And so, while the stock price was going the wrong way, everything inside the company was going the right way.\u201d\n\nDo with this what you will. These are simply observations. Feel free to correct any errors, point out things I missed or use this material any way you wish. To be perfectly clear, this is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor nor am I associated in any way with any commercial interests beyond my own.  Given how much disinformation has been out there, I thought I\u2019d do my bit to peel back the layers on what I consider to be a reliable long term investment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis concludes our public service announcement. We now return to normal programming.",

        "selftext": "#What happened\n\n[$PSFE had some particularly shitty Q3 earnings on 11/11](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-reports-third-quarter-2021-115900850.html). Earnings were reported before open, and the stock value nearly halved, from $7.28 -&gt; $4.16  in the first thirty minutes of trading.\n\n#What the fuck is a Paysafe\n\nPaysafe is basically Paypal/Venmo for non-Americans. They sell 'payment processing solutions.' The shit is really boring and you can look at the PDFs on their website if you really care. They're a transaction middle man that sells stuff to businesses for charging money to people, and they have a digital wallet (like Venmo) that they want people to use for transactions. The digital wallet is where they expected most of their revenue growth to come from this year.\n\n#Why earnings sucked\n\nIn the earnings report, it looks like they're losing money -- the company listed a net loss of $147.2M. However, that includes a $322.2M loss from the company devaluing their digital wallet business. That means the accountants just decided something they owned was worth less money than the value they originally made up -- so they made up a new number -- and put the difference as a loss on their earnings sheet.\n\nThey technically made $106.4M cash profit in Q3. However, the value of their digital wallet business they claimed in previous quarters was actually a complete fugazi. That's spooky shit for investors. But fundamentally, accounting on earnings reports is just smoke and mirrors anyway -- you're stupid if all you're looking at is EPS.\n\nThen, as a fucking cherry on top, the CFO said they're going to make a smaller revenue and profit than they originally planned for at least the next year. (yikes) He did an AMA on Twitter though, and made some solid arguments for why the company could still pull some interesting shit off. (meh)\n\n#Analysis\n\nWhat you're witnessing on the price drop isn't people running from a company losing money -- $PSFE makes steady profits -- what you're witnessing is investors bailing from what they though was a growth company. The promise of growth dried up.\n\nThis isn't a potential downward spiral into bankruptcy like $WISH or $NKLA. It's just a boring company with $1.5B of annual revenue and $400M of annual profits if they don't start flexing harder. Frankly, value is there, and the growth potential still exists (if they get their shit together).\n\nMore importantly, the IV is fucking retarded right now because of the drop. You can turn this into a pretty easy theta play by buying a discounted stock and selling covered calls to idiots that think a squeeze is coming.\n\nThere is no evidence of this bEiNg AnOtHer ShOrT sQueEze, it's more likely some large institutions bailed when they realized this thing wasn't a growth stock -- and their portfolio required a growth stock. However, if you're a conspiracy theorist, buy and hold I guess.\n\n#Positions:\nThis isn't a yolo or a profit thread, it's DD \nbut:\n2,500 shares @ 4.28\nSelling OTM FDs for dumb prices",

        "selftext": "So, PayPal.\n\nAs some may have seen the last couple weeks PayPal's stock price has been on a down trend since the announcement of the Amazon partnership with Venmo (which PayPal owns). This will come into effect in early 2022. I really don't see too much of a downside to this, Venmo has been supporting cryptocurrencies just this year and I see this as a direct line for amazon purchases to be paid via cryptocurrency. And if we keep seeing adoption rates rising then this could be a huge play for PayPal to hold the advantage over Affirm and other payment platforms.\n\nOkay, Q3 Earnings.\n\nFor this quarter, we see an income increase of only 6% over Q2, 1.02b to 1.08 b. Net revenue increase of 13%, $5.4b to $6.2b, long term debt is down roughly $1 billion as well from Dec 2020. Total Liabilities was up 2b, mostly in accrued expenses and funds payable to customers. As a whole, PayPal's debt came to $52 billion, and with annual revenue at $21.4b this is a tad concerning. Free cash flow increased 19%, and this year PayPal also increased spending in marketing and technology/development while decreasing spending for administration, so take this as you will.\n\nNet new active accounts has fallen since last year by 12%. But, total payment volume since last year rose from $247b to $310b Number of payment transactions has also increased by about the same value (4%), but I see this increasing in Q1-Q2 of next year with Venmo partnering with Amazon. So as a whole there is strong customer engagement and a growing balance sheet.\n\nNow, future outlook.\n\nPaidy, a Japanese two sided buy-now, pay-later platform closed in October, so PayPal is looking to expand in Japan. This is big as Japans e-commerce is third ranking in the world. Along with this PayPal looks to develop more in app purchasing and expansion in various cryptocurrencies.\n\nRecently there has been a lot of stirring in the news about PayPal needing to take a defensive stance against companies like Shopify, Affirm, and other BNPL services. On top of this Bernstein analysts downgraded their stock from a \"buy\" to \"hold\". The headlines defiantly resonated poorly with stock price, now down roughly 4%.\n\nConcluding this little deep dive I find it hard to believe that PayPal will be a roll over in the next two to three years, as they are one of a few market leaders in their sector. In my opinion the nose dive in stock price is somewhat of a knee jerk reaction, and PayPal is now in a nice place to buy in.\n\nI'm also curious where everyone's opinion is regarding PayPal.\n\nThanks for Reading.\n\nSources:\n\n[https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc\\_financials/2021/q3/Q3-21-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf](https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/Q3-21-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf)\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/17/paypal-shares-drop-after-bernstein-downgrades-stock-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/17/paypal-shares-drop-after-bernstein-downgrades-stock-.html)\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/paypal-now-risks-gettingdisrupted-by-competitors-analyst-says-in-downgrade-11637160014](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/paypal-now-risks-gettingdisrupted-by-competitors-analyst-says-in-downgrade-11637160014)",

        "selftext": " **BUY PayPal stock now**\n\nPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) price was beaten down after a series of events and yesterday the CEO has delivered a weak guidance despite announcing the partnership with Amazon. They are well established, and they have a solid track record with big growth potential. With the current price, it offer investor a better opportunity to enter into the stock and potentially to buy at a lower price.\n\n**Lets take a look at PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL)**\n\n**Financial Health - no issue**\n\nLiabilities - debt to equity ratio of 42.8% (Total debt 8,945 Million / Total Equity 20,905 Million) as at June 30, 2021. *As interest rate is low, it is an excellent strategy to take on more debts to have more rooms for business expansion.*\n\nDebt Coverage - PayPal is well covered by operating cash flow (64%)\n\nInterest Coverage - PayPal's interest payments on debts are well covered by EBIT (24.7x coverage)\n\nCash &amp; Short term investments USD$12.4 billion\n\n**Earnings - Positive Earning Trend**\n\nTheir profit margin have been growing from 5.2% in year 2014 to 20.4% in year 2021. They have grown significantly by an average of 25% per year over the past 5 years.\n\nHigh ROE - 23.3% (ROE indicates how well a company's management deploys shareholder capital).\n\n**Ownership breakdown**\n\nInstitutions make up 82% of majority of ownership and general public of 17.9% . Big institutional / fund house such as Vanguards, Blackrock, state street global advisors are the top shareholders holding majority of the shares.\n\n**Future - Partnership with Amazon**\n\nPayPal said it had inked a deal with Amazon to allow the firm\u2019s Venmo wallets in the U.S. to be accepted on Amazon\u2019s website and mobile app starting next year. Amazon being the largest e-commerce in the world, has **300 million active users** as of (1 November 2021) and **162 million active users** are from US. Due to Amazon\u2019s global scope and reach, it is also considered one of the most valuable brand worldwide. This also means that PayPal got to access to Amazon users and the payments can be done through PayPal's Venmo wallets. This is going to be the biggest revenue source going forward.\n\n**Digitalization - convenience is part of us now after Covid19**\n\nEven economies are re-opening, we are every much used to digitalization where we find convenience in purchasing groceries and items online. Even the economy are open, my family and I still find these habits are to stay, we don't physically go to the stores and pick up items that often because I find (1) the prices online are usually more competitive, (2) I do not need to carry large bulky items home (3) whatever I sees in the stores, I will be able to buy online, so if I am not in a rush, I will still get my items online. My family did the same too.\n\nWith Covid19, it had sped up our pace of digitalization, the baby boomer and generation X who are usually not good with computers and mobile applications are forced to use online payments to minimized human contact. Once they got hold of it, the habits are to stay. My mother had learnt to order Amazon Prime for groceries have been very happy with it, she commented that she got competitive prices like other supermarket, and most importantly, the groceries are delivered right to the doorstep without her going out and carrying the items home which she had to persuade my brother to go with her to help her in carrying. Even economy are opening up, she is still going to continue to do that as she had found the conveniences and comfort of online shopping. And prior to Covid19, even amazon prime was around, she had refused to learn to shop online.\n\n**Forward guidance Vs potential**\n\nI will think the forward guidance from the CEO, Dan Schulman, is an overstatement. He is trying to manage expectations but it came out badly. But as well, it has presented us an opportunity to get the PayPal as the potential is huge.",

        "selftext": "**Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL)**\n\nPaypal after dropping from 310.16 from the high. Now seems to be a good potential for averaging in. At this price Paypal seems to be extremely attractive. Paypal is a well establish company with a huge capital market cap of US$253.4 Billion and it is listed in 11 stock exchanges. \n\n**Stable Growing Profit Margin** \n\nProfit Margin as of 30 sep is 20.1% and they have been growing significantly by 26.8% per annual over the past 5 years. \n\n**Healthy Financial** \n\nDebt to Equity ratio is 40.5% ( Total Debt 8947 million to  Total Equity 22,090 million) \n\nThe debt are well covered by operating cash flow (66.2%) \n\nInterest Payments are well covered by EBIT (24.7x) \n\n**Business is on the right track** \n\n**Partnering with Amazon** \n\nPaypal is on the right track on tieing up with the trillion market cap giant - Amazon on the Venmo payments, which will enable the e-commerce giant to start accepting Venmo payments in 2022. Venmo is already a peer-to-peer payments leader with over 80 million customers, but it's facing tough competition from Square's Cash App, which surpassed 70 million annual active users earlier this year. Partnering with Amazon will generate fresh tailwinds for Venmo and help the service maintain its narrow lead. \n\n**Cryptocurrency** \n\nThey are on cryptocurrency business too. \n\n**PayPal's user base continues to grow**\n\nPayPal ended the third quarter with 416 million active accounts, and its total payment volume (TPV) hit $310 billion. Those core metrics, along with its total revenue, have consistently grown by double digits year over year. \n\nDuring the earnings call, CEO Dan Schulman said PayPal still remained \"quite confident\" in its goal of hitting 750 million active accounts in 2025. That target, which supports another goal of generating more than $50 billion of revenue by that same year, implies its active accounts will increase at a compound annual rate (CAGR) of nearly 15% over the next four years.\n\nThat expansion relies on the ability of PayPal's new \"super app\" -- which bundles together a digital wallet, a savings account, peer-to-peer payments, bill payments, direct deposits, cryptocurrency services, BNPL (buy now, pay later) services, and other offerings -- to lock in its users, widen its moat against rivals like Square, and reduce its churn rates.",

The company provides B2B services for millions of SMB and enterprises around the world\n\nThe growth of Payoneer\u2019s global network included a move into India in April 2016, following a partnership with Pune-based IndusInd Bank and expressions of interest in its services from more than 10,000 freelancers and small businesses across the country.\n\n2018 PayPal study suggest that India\u2019s freelancers represent around one quarter of the world\u2019s gig workforce.\n\n**In August 2019, Payoneer announced a year-on-year increase of 400% in its customer base and a threefold increase in payment volumes processed in India.**\n\n*\u201cPayPal says to shut domestic payments business in India\u201d \\~ Reuters*\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - PayPal Holdings Inc will wind down its domestic payments business in India from April 1,2021 the company said in a statement on Friday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hhza5041h2081.png?width=1743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68e6bf53ca2bac7703919dbfab86bacbc49c0e89\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x0b8v621h2081.png?width=1759&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb18aeaaf2806e2c0123eff083901b6b53691b5b\n\nThe ideal customer is a small but growing SMB doing business all over the world which needs currency, compliance and business services. Payoneer is an obvious candidate to handles these needs given its global network.\n\n\u00b7 Payoneer offers vendors the ability to move money with a U.S. bank account and pay suppliers, without having to deal with too many banking hurdles or red tape.\n\n\u00b7 A lot of freelancers on Upwork.com use Payoneer because many of them live in countries that Upwork.com can't wire money to.\n\n\u00b7 Once vendors receive funds into their Payoneer account they can either withdraw the cash using their Payoneer provided Master Card or do a direct bank transfer from Payoneer to their local bank. Usually funds arrive within 1-2 business days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/okzrve92h2081.png?width=1764&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c61bd06737a159941b6f9f26d96255fc497029c7\n\nSo, it is basically a bank that includes an accountant to help meet a business\u2019 needs. The one product or feature that is missing is digital coins.\n\nSay a consumer wants to rent an airbnb. They use a credit card (or other payment method) to pay airbnb, a payment gateway facilitates payment acceptance. The payment is then processed and Airbnb ends up with the money from the transaction. Airbnb has now gathered cash through its acquirers (e.g., Adyen, ACI). Airbnb now needs to distribute funds to its SMB sellers. Airbnb uses payoneer to disburse funds to sellers. From this example, you can see Payoneer isn't competing with companies like Adyen or other acquirers/ processors, even though they are processing payments.\n\nPayoneer signs up individual sellers, which allows the sellers to use payoneer across platforms (e.g., facebook marketplace and amazon). Hyperwallet (owned by PayPal) is one of their competitors, but Hyperwallet operates completely differently, they sign up users via the platform, but this means you can't use hyperwallet for your business on both amazon and fb marketplace without going through the onboarding process again. Given the trend towards SMB sellers operating across multiple marketplaces, this is a huge benefit for payoneer, and makes PayPal's offering a lot less competitive. It also means Payoneer owns the seller relationship in a way that PayPal doesn't do as effectively, and makes it easier for them to package other offerings (e.g., working capital). These other offerings provide a two-fold benefit - their customer relationships become stronger, so revenue is seen as more recurring and investors will pay a higher multiple; and they'll make more money per customer.\n\nMy view is that Payoneer should see an S-type growth curve, where they'll hit a critical mass of users and see exponential growth, like cashapp, or venmo. Their investor presentation projects 25% revenue growth over the next couple years, I think this is super conservative, especially considering that 25% growth rate doesn't account for the two travel related marketplaces that got screwed by covid. Once they hit that critical mass of users, they'll pop off, sales &amp; marketing expenses will drop, and they'll become profitable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h4bl85z2h2081.png?width=1556&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70d883ab62f7fb8a486f106a561fb6b927009211\n\nThe company\u2019s focus on investing for future services is actually what gets me most excited as it may ward off near-term investor interest and improves its competitive position. It\u2019s also a sign of a mature management team. The opportunity to provide additional services such as working capital, compliance and tax services seems like an obvious strategic move to drive growth. Specifically, working capital is far and away the most important service and something SMBs are desperate for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r6mxf5e3h2081.png?width=1664&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b56c5ccf853698f4f9ded9ecff758e2235e20180\n\nWho are their customers and where are they know? 5 million businesses in 190 countries. Customers include Amazon, Wish, Lazada (owned by Alibaba) Shopee, and Ebay. Weird right, they work with Ebay given Paypal does too. This is because they work with countries and specific clients that Paypal not accept into their platform. Investors need to understand that sometimes people have to use other platforms because they the Paypal\u2019s or banks are NOT willing to take the risk. Sure the risk is probably higher but the amount of people that need access to capital or payment process is high when many banks in many countries do not approve people for such type of access.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bt75qez3h2081.png?width=1631&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16c8e2fe383ce420e3c7a435f414ce4a74f599fd\n\nB2B global marketplace. The attractiveness of FinTech can be summarized in a few words, namely, \u201cscale\u201d and \u201cnetwork effects\u201d. From the metrics Payoneer shared, it looks like they\u2019re benefitting from these dynamics. Analysts estimate the global B2B market at tens of trillions $ and cross-border payments at $300bn. Obviously the pandemic only accelerated these trends. (From the presentation, it looks like company B2B AR/AP volume more than doubled at 140% in 2020 although the CFO later cited a 53% increase in volumes so not sure exactly how to interpret that.)\n\nVolume and customer growth drives revenues. Volumes grew over 53% in 2020 (67% adjusted for the pandemic) and are expected to grow at 44% and 33% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, which translates into 25% annual revenue growth per year for the next two years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ez48k0d4h2081.png?width=1721&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a58e917de3a963c384df9a7c6075f317d4539789\n\nThe benefits of network effects cannot be overstated as Paypal has proven. As a company acquires more customers, the value of its network increases. Payoneer\u2019s business model leverages this same dynamic. Moreover, its network would be very difficult to replicate. The company\u2019s global platform includes over 80 banks and clearing partners in over 100 countries. The company also provides customers data about its transactions, which I believe will be increasingly useful and sticky.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fbqvrzp4h2081.png?width=1797&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b11294b0e932cc3737f7a0dba4788d382fc59e9\n\nWhat do I think the future holds for Payoneer? I actually think there are several exits for this company.\n\n**Growth:**\n\nNote that Payoneer currently doesn\u2019t do B2C, hence it may be quite common for retail to never even have heard of it, unless they are a business or in the gig economy. That is one of the problems for the stock, no one has heard of it (yet) because it works quietly behind the scenes. Given enough funding, who knows, Payoneer may well expand to B2C. Alibaba initially started as B2B as well but has since expanded to B2C (Taobao).\n\nWe just need Payoneer to be 5% of PayPal (ie. $15B market cap) in order for stock price to be in the $30-$40 range. ($6B market cap corresponds to around $13-$15 stock price.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mdrd9h35h2081.png?width=1748&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=141ff8aaf50438f69846e1cdf874a66a59c8fc8f\n\n\\*\\*Acquisition:\\*\\*Large international payments processer buys them. Could be Paypal, Square, Stripe, First Data, etc. consolidation WILL happen in this space and I think short-term Payoneer will acquire some companies and then be sold to a bigger company. Think of this as how banks in the USA were allowed to merge in 1995 given the law that passed. Before you had 100,000 banks then it was 50,000 banks, then 10,000 banks and now like 5,000 banks but the top 10 banks make up a large % of the business/volume.\n\nWildcard: CRM business buys them. What many people do not realize is that CRM\u2019s have been changing the game. First it was to help you sell with marketing tools, then it is to improve communication within the team, then it will be storage, and legal transactions then it will be financial transaction. They are literally going to control the beginning to the end of the customer relationship and all of that data they possess is very valuable to help their customers grow.\n\nThis is not financial advice, i am not a financial advisor. I have a long position with the warrants that i purchased in February and are therefore in the red.",

He followed with a tweet saying he would abide by the poll. \u201cYes\u201d won. It\u2019s unclear what would happen next, as Twitter polls are generally not considered legally binding.

        "selftext": "PayPal Holdings Inc. has a reputation for disrupting the payments ecosystem, but it \u201cnow risks getting disrupted\u201d itself, according to an analyst. Bernstein\u2019s Harshita Rawat downgraded the stock to market perform from outperform Wednesday, citing various competitive pressures for the digital payments giant. Shares of PayPal PYPL, -4.36% are off 2.5% in premarket trading.\n\nRawat worries about the \u201cincreasing aggregation\u201d of e-commerce activity on large platforms like Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.23% and Shopify Inc. SHOP, -2.24%, which she estimates are together responsible for about 32% of U.S. commerce. \u201cAmazon currently doesn\u2019t accept PayPal and just agreed to accept Venmo starting in 2022,\u201d she wrote. \u201cShopify has ambitions of creating its own payments business and has been pushing its merchants aggressively to convert to Shopify payments platform (and also towards the Shop Pay button).\u201d\n\nSmaller merchants \u201care PayPal\u2019s bread and butter, and Shopify\u2019s meteoric rise and push towards its own payments platform is particularly problematic,\u201d Rawat continued. PayPal\u2019s transaction economics are better with smaller businesses than with very large ones, she argued. Shopify Inc. represents an \u201cunassailable competitor\u201d when it comes to the small-business demographic, in her view.\n\nRawat is also concerned that PayPal\u2019s market-share gains will slow. The company has typically won share at the expense of manual card entry onto a website, but fewer consumers are entering their card information this way, she said, meaning there is less available land to grab there. She estimates that manual card entry now accounts for about 20% of e-commerce checkout, down from roughly 33% four years back. More broadly, she thinks that share gains could slow \u201cby a thousand cuts\u201d thanks to the rise of a number of technologies that separately eat away at opportunities for PayPal. These include the growth of buy-now pay-later (BNPL) services, the ability to auto-fill credit-card information on some web browsers, and the threat of Apple Pay as ever more commerce shifts online. \u201cIt is an understatement to say that the payments landscape is rapidly evolving with many powerful trends emerging,\u201d Rawat said in her note to clients. \u201cWhile PayPal is actively investing and evolving, it simply has more turf to defend versus peers in our view.\u201d Rawat acknowledged that her thesis could prove incorrect if PayPal delivers upbeat surprises with its efforts to drive more revenue from its Venmo app and its \u201csuperapp\u201d redesign that focuses on features beyond just payments. \u201cAfter years of false starts, we believe Venmo is finally on the cusp of getting monetized,\u201d she wrote. While Rawat has \u201chistorically been skeptical of aggressive monetization estimates for Venmo,\u201d she feels more \u201cconstructive\u201d now. \u201cVenmo monetization is now less about following the PayPal playbook and more about following Cash App\u2019s journey,\u201d she wrote, referencing Square Inc.\u2019s SQ, -2.78% mobile wallet.\n\nShares of PayPal have declined 20% over the past three months as the S&amp;P 500 SPX, -0.26% has risen about 6%.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/paypal-now-risks-gettingdisrupted-by-competitors-analyst-says-in-downgrade-11637160014?mod=mw\\_quote\\_news](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/paypal-now-risks-gettingdisrupted-by-competitors-analyst-says-in-downgrade-11637160014?mod=mw_quote_news)",

Some say that was based on Pinterest's announcement of enabling sellers to upload images and catalogues and offering them directly to an online audience. \n\nThe expansion into online shopping is what makes Pinterest attractive to PayPal and the other digital payment companies. A number of analysts say they expect the tie-ups within e-commerce/social media companies and digital payment giants to grow in the future. \n\nThe bad news around PINS is that the co-founder Evan Sharp is stepping down from the company and has sold all of his shares in the month of October. According to Finviz, a number of other insiders has been selling stock recently as well. \n\nThe other bad news is that Pinterest reported it had lost 42 million active monthly users as we are moving out from the pandemic. \n\nSo what's your take and where do you see PINS going tomorrow?",

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, November 9, 2021**\n\nThe stock market took a breather, putting a pause on this record-breaking rally, with all three major indexes closing the day lower. In recent weeks, market participants have rode an extended wave of optimism amid better than expected earnings season, new, better than expected economic data, the passage of the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill in Congress, and a new antiviral coronavirus pill from Pfizer (PFE). \n\nWith roughly 89% of companies in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) having already reported earnings, 81% of those have so far posted better than expected earnings per share and 75% of those reported better than expected revenue. FactSet projects that the year-on-year earnings growth rate for the index stands at 40%, though this number has continued creeping higher as earnings season unfolds. \n\n[https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight\\_110521.pdf](https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_110521.pdf)\n\nMarci McGregor, Bank of America Merryl Lynch Senior Investment Strategist said, \u201cI still think it\u2019s all about corporate profits.  I know a lot of my peers are concerned that peak earnings growth is behind us. But I think peak earnings isn\u2019t even a 2022 story. We\u2019re seeing solid consumer demand, a strong U.S. economy, and I think we\u2019re going to have a capex cycle in 2022. And I think that\u2019s all positive for corporate profits, and that underpins this market, in my view.\u201d\n\nHowever, despite positive earnings, a host of companies have cited constraints around raw materials, labor shortages, and general supply-chain disruptions affecting the bottom line. According to Bank of America, mentions of supply chains on quarterly earnings calls have surged by 360% compared to last year, underscoring the widespread nature of these pressures. These supply-related issues have also contributed to still-elevated inflationary trends. Tuesday's Producer Price Index from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that producer prices rose by 8.6% over last year, matching October's rate for the fastest on record in data going back to Nov. 2010. \n\nKristina Hooper, Chief Global Market Strategist at Invesco, said \u201cI would expect inflation to peak by mid-year 2022. It should remain elevated but it should move lower in the back half of 2022. So while this is certainly an issue, it is part of what we should expect coming out of the pandemic. We have gotten out of a burning building, but we should expect that there is a little smoke and water damage as a result. That\u2019s really what we\u2019re experiencing with elevated inflation and supply chain disruptions\u201d. I agree with this position and think the analogy is very apt. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Tesla (TSLA) stock fell more than 10%, pushing down the entire EV sector with it, as the stock price feels the effect of Elon Musk\u2019s poll where he said he would be selling 10% of his stake in Tesla. \n* President Biden interviewed Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard for the job of Chairperson, signaling a serious rival to Jerome Powell Powell as Biden is set to nominate a new leader to the Fed in the coming weeks. I really hope Powell is re-assigned, the market does not need a shakeup right now.\n* Peloton (PTON) continued its sharp drop following earnings, dispute the company revealing a new product designed to track your performance on the bike and give you feedback\n* Roblox (RBLX) stock gapped up hard today while PayPal (PYPL) fell after reporting earnings yesterday afternoon. \n* Twitter (TWTR) launched a new subscription service, called Twitter Blue for $3 a month that allows one to undo or correct tweets, among other mostly aesthetic upgrades.\n* NVIDIA (NVDA), my favorite stock, said it was partnering with a range of self-driving sensor companies, including lidar firm Luminar Technologies (LAZR), to put together a system for autonomous driving as soon as 2024.\n* Moreover, NVIDIA also announced it was releasing a set of tools, called \u201cOmniverse Enterprise\u201d. Their Omniverse, which was beta launched in December, is a simulation and collaboration platform which \u201cserves as the connective tissue for physically accurate 3D virtual worlds,\u201d according to the company. In prepared remarks, Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang said in his keynote address that with Omniverse, \u201cwe now have the technology to create new 3D worlds or model our physical world.\u201d Omniverse Enterprise, which costs $9,000 a year, is also available to customers in a 30-day trial. Just another example of how NVIDIA is going key to powering technology of the future.   \n* Netflix (NFLX) is launching a new TikTok-like short clip feature for kids called \u201cKids Clips\u201d as soon as this week. Netflix said it would add new shirts based on its current and future offerings.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) with two target raises. Stock currently around $149\n   * Susquehanna from $145 to $175 at Positive\n   * Wedbush from $140 to $165 at Outperform\n* Apollo Global Management (APO) target raised by Argus from $76 to $90 at Buy. Stock currently around $76\n* Five9 (FIVN) with two target raises.

Popular ideas found on Pinterest include recipes, home and style ideas, travel destinations, and many others. There\u2019s an algorithm that provides visual recommendations based on personal tastes and interests.  \n\n\nQuantitative Analysis  \nAt the time of this writing (10/31/2021), PINS is trading at $44.64 with a 52 week range of $44.04 - $89.90 and a market cap of $28.78B. In Q2 of 2021, revenue increased 125% year-over-year (YoY) to $613 million. GAAP net income was $69 million for Q2 and adjusted EBITDA was $178 million for Q2. Return of equity (ROE: Net Income / Total Equity \\*100) of PINS is 7.16% and net margin (net income / revenue) is 7.18%. The debt to equities ratio (total liabilities / total equity) is 0.15 and the price to earnings (P/E) ratio is 177.14.  \n\n\nQualitative Analysis  \nPinterest global monthly active users grew 9% year over year to 454 million. Pinterest currently has a unique niche that few other social media outlets can offer. Pinterest allows users to create a curated pinboard of content to see designs and ideas that interest them. With more and more content creators coming onto the scene, Pinterest is slightly losing its moat to other outlets that offer newsfeeds and photos and videos, like Instagram. Pinterest currently has the 3rd highest global users according to GlobalStats with 8.15% of the market share and is the 3rd highest user base of any social media behind Facebook and Twitter. Rumors of a potential acquisition by PayPal have been floating around recently, however this is unlikely to actually happen. PayPal announced last week that it was not pursuing the acquisition, causing a sharp drop in Pinterest stock price. It will be interesting to see if Apple\u2019s new privacy policy will affect Pinterest as drastically as it affected other social media companies, like Snap Inc.  \n\n\nBullish Thesis  \n1. Strong financial performance: Despite waning active user growth, PINS continues to post strong revenue growth. In their 2021 Q2 report, they posted $613M in global revenue, a 125% increase from 2020 Q2. Most of this revenue growth came from users outside of the U.S., which is unsurprising given that their increase in active monthly users during this time period came entirely from outside the U.S. (active monthly users from Q2 of 2020 to 2021 increased by 13% internationally but decreased by 5% in the U.S.). Unfortunately for PINS, the average revenue per US user is $5.08 compared to $0.36 for the international users. If PINS can stop losing U.S. users and find ways to increase revenue in their international user base, they could really see a boost in value. \u00a0  \n   \n2. E-Commerce Integration: In May of 2020 Pinterest announced that they would allow Shopify merchants to quickly upload catalogs into shoppable Pins. From Q1 to Q2 2021, catalog uploads grew 50%, driven in large part by their expansion to include international merchants. In Q3 PINS began testing their integration of Automattic\u2019s WooCommerce, an open source ecommerce plug-in for WordPress (we should get an update on this when PINS reports Q3 earnings, scheduled for November 4th). Integration of in-app ecommerce functionality will likely increase per-user revenue, which could help combat a waning user base (at least in the U.S.) and new policies making it difficult for advertisers to track user data.  \n\n\n3. Leadership Recognition of Challenges: In their Q2 2021 letter to investors, PINS leadership clearly acknowledged lower user engagement (see snippet from the letter below). While recognition is only the first step in problem solving, it\u2019s without a doubt an important part of the process. Investors should be glad to see leadership at PINS recognizing and defining the challenges they face coming out of the pandemic but will need to keep an eye on how well they generate solutions.  \n\n\nBearish Thesis  \n1. Losing Uniqueness: Pinterest is known as a place where you could curate a pinboard of cool ideas and designs with short GIFs and other ideas, but now with more and more content creators there are plenty of other outlets like TikTok and Instagram which either curate a newsfeed for you or you can create a newsfeed with creators who put out content you enjoy. With more and more social media outlets offering different ways to consume, it seems Pinterest is just another social media app that people will only go to when they would like to do a DIY project. Some DIY projects can be found on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube so some users may not go to Pinterest as the first stop. Also Pinterest is a social media that many go to for purchasing goods and unique items where few other social medias can compete, but with the addition of Instagram shop and Facebook marketplace others that moat may be shrinking.  \n\n\n2. Declining Views: \u00a0According to Nasdaq, visitors to Pinterest via the phone app and website are lower than numbers seen in Q3 of 2019. Many speculate that this is due to countries opening up after the COVID-19 pandemic and spending less time on apps and websites in general, but these are numbers that are below the start of the pandemic. If this trend continues, this could mean the beginning of the end of Pinterest. There has been rumors that companies like PayPal and Target are attempting to acquire Pinterest but it seems that even the acquisition interest is declining. As less people visit the application and website, the less money will be spent on advertising in a growingly difficult world to advertise with Apple\u2019s new privacy structure. All in all, this rapid decline in viewership is something to keep an eye on in earnings going forward.  \n\n\n3. Heavy advertising dependency: Similarly to Snap, Pinterest has a huge reliance on advertisements for their revenue. Snap saw a massive dip in revenue and stock price and Pinterest has seen a similar dip. Pinterest's only revenue source is advertisements and unlike Snap, Pinterest does not have another revenue source or something proprietary to profit off of.\u00a0 Pinterest will have to adjust how they use advertisements, which could be more based on the interest of their pinboards instead of based on search history and other targeted ads. Time will tell how successful this strategy will be and how much advertisers will pay for this type of advertising.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo get my full breakdown check it out [here.](https://greencandleinvestments.substack.com/p/pinterest-inc-ticker-pins-brief-breakdown?r=ksa6f&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAre you bullish or bearish on Pinterest?",

        "selftext": "**What to invest?**\n\nIf you have some spare funds and waiting to deploy for investment, you may to invest in PayPal   (NASDAQ:PYPL)  as the price has come off significantly. I am waiting for an opportunity to invest into well establish companies at a lower price, PayPal is one of them.  The company had **377 million active accounts at the end of 2020, including 29 million merchant accounts**. The company also owns Xoom, an international money transfer business, and Venmo, a person-to-person payment platform.\n\n**Positive Earning Trend and debts are not an issue**\n\nTheir profit margin have been growing from 5.2% in year 2014 to 20.4% in year 2021. They have grown significantly by an average of 25% per year over the past 5 years.\n\nLast profit margin is 20.1% as at 30 September 2021 with a net income of USD4,997 Millions\n\nHigh ROE - 23.3% (ROE indicates how well a company's management deploys shareholder capital).\n\nLiabilities - debt to equity ratio of 36% (Total debt 7,949 Million / Total Equity 22,090 Million) as at Sep 30, 2021. *As interest rate is low, it is an excellent strategy to take on more debts to have more rooms for business expansion. Note that the debts to equity ratio had reduced from 42.8% to 36% in a quarter.*\n\nDebt Coverage - PayPal is well covered by operating cash flow (74.5%)\n\nInterest Coverage - PayPal's interest payments on debts are well covered by EBIT (35.7x coverage)\n\nCash &amp; Short term investments improves from USD$12.4 billion to USD$13.292\n\n**Potential - partnership with Amazon** \n\n PayPal said it had inked a deal with Amazon to allow the firm\u2019s Venmo wallets in the U.S. to be accepted on Amazon\u2019s website and mobile app starting next year. Amazon being the largest e-commerce in the world, has **300 million active users** as of (1 November 2021) and **162 million active users** are from US. Due to Amazon\u2019s global scope and reach, it is also considered one of the most valuable brand worldwide. This also means that PayPal got to access to Amazon users and the payments can be done through PayPal's Venmo wallets. This is going to be the biggest revenue source going forward. \n\n**Plenty of room to grow in the ecommerce space**\n\nThere is still plenty of runway for growth in electronic payments. Electronic payments only surpassed cash payments on a global basis a couple of years especially during the pandemic period where the baby boomer started to explore the online and as well as developing countries who started to use online and more of the payment services. Over the years, PayPal had built a good reputation on the payment services for being highly secured and as well as bringing conveniences. \n\n**Unique business Model - ability to combat fraud** \n\nPayPal have this  unique business model centers around a two-sided platform, with PayPal enjoying relationships with both merchants and consumers. This approach has material benefits and was instrumental in allowing PayPal to develop its current foothold in the industry. Having information on both sides of the transaction gives PayPal a meaningful edge in combating fraud, which was a very meaningful factor in the early days of the Internet, and remains a key issue. With an ability to combat fraud, PayPal was in a position to become a valued partner on both sides of a payment. (Source: Morningstar) With this feature, I will always opt to have my items checkout using PayPal if there is an option for it because I know it will be highly secured. \n\n**Who are the shareholders of PayPal?** \n\nOwnership breakdown\n\n* **82% Institutional** \n* 17.9% General Public \n* State or Government 0.04%\n* Individual Insider 0.08% \n\n[Top shareholders of PayPal ](https://preview.redd.it/kgwoblux5sy71.jpg?width=701&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4a3c78c9cd04c52b7409ab766d2abfc04376955)\n\nAs you can see, the top shareholders of PayPal are mostly institutional/ fund houses which make up of 82%. They do also that believe that PayPal have a value to hold for long term. \n\n**Fair Value**\n\nWith an established client based, strong brand name, good balance sheet and potential. I  will believe that PayPal will have a long way to do. My fair value for PayPal is around 255. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;*Hey Reddit friends, please follow me if you likes my article.

        "selftext": " Hello all,\n\nI'm  a 24 year old newbie just started to invest for about 3 months. I do not have a good income rn (\\~25k a year but starting in next spring I will have a raise and bump it to 50-70k.) but i just want to dip my toes in the water and start learning about investing. Was doing okay  (initial deposit was 3.5k) and was up about 5% until I find out WSB.  Made some retard plays (listened to those \"DD\" about CLOV, IRNT, CRSR)  and lost about 15% of my portfolio. After that I started to do a lot  more DD and here are my current position:\n\nTD account\n\n3 shares of AAPL @ 150\n\n3 shares of AMC @ 40\n\n1 share of AMD @ 105\n\n1 share of DIS @ 160\n\n15 shares of SOFI @ 19 and 2 option plays April 2022 strike 25 and 30 (bought that 6 weeks ago first and only option play)\n\n1 share of tsm @ 110\n\n1 share of unity @ 120\n\n1 share of V @ 210\n\n1 share of VOO @ 410\n\nWEBULL account\n\n1.5 share of AFRM @ 130\n\n0.12 share of GOOG @ 2680\n\n1 share of MSFT @ 283\n\n0.5 share of TSLA (Bought @ 700 and sold half @ 1150 \\~10 days ago, totally lucky play)\n\n0.1 share of AMZN @ 3250\n\n1.3 share of FB @ 330\n\n2.5 share of PYPL @ 235 (RIP)\n\n1 share of NVDA @ 200\n\nAs  you can see I have tons of different stocks all over the places, I'm up  about 8% overall even after those retard plays (been adding more  deposits overtime so total principle now is 5.5k) until recently SOFI  start tanking and today a lot of tech stocks tank because of the  treasury yields FUD.\n\nI'm glad that  I started to invest in a relatively young age, and I've been reading a  lot of articles and books to understand the market, but the more i know  the more I don't know. And my biggest problem is I keep looking at my  phone every 5 mins and it has been heavily influence my work life and  life in general negatively.\n\nNow here's my question;\n\nShould  i just put like 75% of my portfolio and a few ETFs so I can actually  enjoy life and not to worry about stock every 5 sec? I would be lying to  say I don't want to make big money quick but I've learn my lesson  knowing I'm not smart or experienced enough to swing trade (or have time  to do so.) I've been looking at putting 50% of my port in QQQ and VOO,  and 20% to SMH and then 20% with specific stocks that i like and 10%  cash. Any recommendation of what kinds of ETFs should I get base on the  stocks that I own rn?

        "selftext": "Listen up silly turkeys, I get it. It's been a really rough few months. Everytime there's a small spike hedgies manage to smack the price right back down. This is exactly how the short sellers want us to feel so we just give up and paper hand. Well guess what? Not me mother fuckers because I know what I own. RKT is thee most undervalued stock in the current market. There's plenty of solid DD that has been previously posted but I'll point out a few highlights. \n\n1. Q2 2021: $2.67 in revenue / $920M income. Approx 4B cash on hand \n2. 90% customer retention rate\n3. RKT enjoys approx 10% market share of a 3.5T consumer lending market.\n4. Recently launched Rocket homes, Rocket Auto which is doing very well. \n\nRocket is a Fintech company. The ability of being able to apply for a home loan, car loan, solar loan on your PC or phone is the definition of Fintech. This company is literally printing money while the rest of Reddit is busy pumping and dumping SPAC's and dinosaurs. Don't believe all the FUD about housing crash because it's not happening. The federal government is 30T in debt and cannot afford higher interest rates. They will keep interest rates low even if it means letting inflation and housing prices run hot. The recent slow down in housing numbers is due to lack of supply, not lack of demand. \nIt's pretty obvious that some big dog(s) is targeting this stock. My guess is that the big banks are the prime suspects. They have been losing crap loads of revenue to the likes of PayPal, Square etc and cannot afford to lose their mortgage business to another Fintech. Again, I have no proof, this is just a hunch but keep in mind that Jamie Dimon from JPMorgan said he considers fintech's the biggest threat to their business and gives him night sweats so just connect the dots. Banks have unlimited amounts of money, just look at the prices of Gold and Silver prices which are being heavily shorted by the banks and I believe that RKT is a victim of these criminals as well. \n\nThe obvious question is why should I buy RKT right now with all these headwinds? \n\nFor starters, RKT still has a $1B open stock buyback program. According to their latest 10Q filing, they purchased $8M worth of stock last quarter at $16.74. If you haven't realized, shorts are having a very hard time pushing the price lower in the last few weeks while short volume has remained steady. This leads me to believe that the company is actively buying back shares at these prices. \nI've read all the bear thesis on RKT and it's all hogwash. Oh, Dan Gilbert owns 93% of the company, this company shouldn't have gone public yada yada yada.... \nWould you rather own a small piece of a good thing or nothing at all? So that's a good reason to short this company to oblivion? What's the problem, you won't be able to buy a large stake and control a company that has been in business for over 35+ years? \nOh yea I forgot, THERE'S A HOUSING CRASH COMING..... \nI wish people would stop referencing Evergrande and comparing the US housing market to the Chinese fiasco. We don't have ghost cities around here and we're actually short seven million homes. \nYes, homes are expensive but there's still solid demand that will keep prices stable. \nFollowing up on the fed meeting yesterday, Jpow is in no rush to raise interest rates which is a great tailwind for the industry. \nThere aren't a lot of bargains left in the stock market and RKT is definitely the best bang for the buck. Earnings are coming up after the bell and I'm expecting beats all around and that elusive divvy \ud83d\ude4f \n\nI'm high as fuck writing this so please don't take this as financial advice. \n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, November 9, 2021**\n\nThe stock market took a breather, putting a pause on this record-breaking rally, with all three major indexes closing the day lower. In recent weeks, market participants have rode an extended wave of optimism amid better than expected earnings season, new, better than expected economic data, the passage of the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill in Congress, and a new antiviral coronavirus pill from Pfizer (PFE). \n\nWith roughly 89% of companies in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) having already reported earnings, 81% of those have so far posted better than expected earnings per share and 75% of those reported better than expected revenue. FactSet projects that the year-on-year earnings growth rate for the index stands at 40%, though this number has continued creeping higher as earnings season unfolds. \n\n[https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight\\_110521.pdf](https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_110521.pdf)\n\nMarci McGregor, Bank of America Merryl Lynch Senior Investment Strategist said, \u201cI still think it\u2019s all about corporate profits.  I know a lot of my peers are concerned that peak earnings growth is behind us. But I think peak earnings isn\u2019t even a 2022 story. We\u2019re seeing solid consumer demand, a strong U.S. economy, and I think we\u2019re going to have a capex cycle in 2022. And I think that\u2019s all positive for corporate profits, and that underpins this market, in my view.\u201d\n\nHowever, despite positive earnings, a host of companies have cited constraints around raw materials, labor shortages, and general supply-chain disruptions affecting the bottom line. According to Bank of America, mentions of supply chains on quarterly earnings calls have surged by 360% compared to last year, underscoring the widespread nature of these pressures. These supply-related issues have also contributed to still-elevated inflationary trends. Tuesday's Producer Price Index from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that producer prices rose by 8.6% over last year, matching October's rate for the fastest on record in data going back to Nov. 2010. \n\nKristina Hooper, Chief Global Market Strategist at Invesco, said \u201cI would expect inflation to peak by mid-year 2022. It should remain elevated but it should move lower in the back half of 2022. So while this is certainly an issue, it is part of what we should expect coming out of the pandemic. We have gotten out of a burning building, but we should expect that there is a little smoke and water damage as a result. That\u2019s really what we\u2019re experiencing with elevated inflation and supply chain disruptions\u201d. I agree with this position and think the analogy is very apt. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Tesla (TSLA) stock fell more than 10%, pushing down the entire EV sector with it, as the stock price feels the effect of Elon Musk\u2019s poll where he said he would be selling 10% of his stake in Tesla. \n* President Biden interviewed Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard for the job of Chairperson, signaling a serious rival to Jerome Powell Powell as Biden is set to nominate a new leader to the Fed in the coming weeks. I really hope Powell is re-assigned, the market does not need a shakeup right now.\n* Peloton (PTON) continued its sharp drop following earnings, dispute the company revealing a new product designed to track your performance on the bike and give you feedback\n* Roblox (RBLX) stock gapped up hard today while PayPal (PYPL) fell after reporting earnings yesterday afternoon. \n* Twitter (TWTR) launched a new subscription service, called Twitter Blue for $3 a month that allows one to undo or correct tweets, among other mostly aesthetic upgrades.\n* NVIDIA (NVDA), my favorite stock, said it was partnering with a range of self-driving sensor companies, including lidar firm Luminar Technologies (LAZR), to put together a system for autonomous driving as soon as 2024.\n* Moreover, NVIDIA also announced it was releasing a set of tools, called \u201cOmniverse Enterprise\u201d. Their Omniverse, which was beta launched in December, is a simulation and collaboration platform which \u201cserves as the connective tissue for physically accurate 3D virtual worlds,\u201d according to the company. In prepared remarks, Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang said in his keynote address that with Omniverse, \u201cwe now have the technology to create new 3D worlds or model our physical world.\u201d Omniverse Enterprise, which costs $9,000 a year, is also available to customers in a 30-day trial. Just another example of how NVIDIA is going key to powering technology of the future.   \n* Netflix (NFLX) is launching a new TikTok-like short clip feature for kids called \u201cKids Clips\u201d as soon as this week. Netflix said it would add new shirts based on its current and future offerings.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) with two target raises. Stock currently around $149\n   * Susquehanna from $145 to $175 at Positive\n   * Wedbush from $140 to $165 at Outperform\n* Apollo Global Management (APO) target raised by Argus from $76 to $90 at Buy. Stock currently around $76\n* Five9 (FIVN) with two target raises. Stock currently around $167\n   * KeyCorp from $200 to $208 Overweight\n   * Wells Fargo from $200 to $210 at Overweight\n* Humana (HUM) target raised by Citigroup from $510 to $528 at Buy. Stock currently around $450\n* Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) target raised by Deutsche Bank from $218 to $225 at Buy. Stock currently around $185\n* Zscaler (ZS) target raised by BTIG Research from $324 to $401 at Buy. Stock currently around $353\n\n\u201cAlways remember that you are absolutely unique. Just like everyone else.\u201d - Margaret Mead",

Some say that was based on Pinterest's announcement of enabling sellers to upload images and catalogues and offering them directly to an online audience. \n\nThe expansion into online shopping is what makes Pinterest attractive to PayPal and the other digital payment companies. A number of analysts say they expect the tie-ups within e-commerce/social media companies and digital payment giants to grow in the future. \n\nThe bad news around PINS is that the co-founder Evan Sharp is stepping down from the company and has sold all of his shares in the month of October. According to Finviz, a number of other insiders has been selling stock recently as well. \n\nThe other bad news is that Pinterest reported it had lost 42 million active monthly users as we are moving out from the pandemic. \n\nSo what's your take and where do you see PINS going tomorrow?",

        "selftext": "\u201cMad Money\u201d host Jim Cramer explained Wednesday why he believes investors should take advantage of the recent pullback in PayPal shares\n\n[Video](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/10/13/jim-cramer-says-paypal-is-a-buy-after-pulling-back-from-its-high.html)\n\nPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) price was beaten down after a series of events and yesterday the CEO has delivered a weak guidance despite announcing the partnership with Amazon. They are well established, and they have a solid track record with big growth potential. With the current price, it offer investor a better opportunity to enter into the stock and potentially to buy at a lower price.\n\n**I had bought PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and below is my analysis:**\n\n**My analysis for PayPal**\n\n1. The company had **377 million active accounts at the end of 2020, including 29 million merchant accounts**. The company also owns Xoom, an international money transfer business, and Venmo, a person-to-person payment platform.\n2. **Positive Earning Trend and debts are well covered.**\n\nTheir profit margin have been growing from 5.2% in year 2014 to 20.4% in year 2021. They have grown significantly by an average of 25% per year over the past 5 years.\n\nLast profit margin is 20.1% as at 30 September 2021 with a net income of USD4,997 Millions\n\nHigh ROE - 23.3% (ROE indicates how well a company's management deploys shareholder capital).\n\nLiabilities - debt to equity ratio of 36% (Total debt 7,949 Million / Total Equity 22,090 Million) as at Sep 30, 2021. *As interest rate is low, it is an excellent strategy to take on more debts to have more rooms for business expansion. Note that the debts to equity ratio had reduced from 42.8% to 36% in a quarter.*\n\nDebt Coverage - PayPal is well covered by operating cash flow (74.5%)\n\nInterest Coverage - PayPal's interest payments on debts are well covered by EBIT (35.7x coverage)\n\nCash &amp; Short term investments improves from USD$12.4 billion to USD$13.292\n\n**3. Partnership with Amazon**\n\nPayPal said it had inked a deal with Amazon to allow the firm\u2019s Venmo wallets in the U.S. to be accepted on Amazon\u2019s website and mobile app starting next year. Amazon being the largest e-commerce in the world, has **300 million active users** as of (1 November 2021) and **162 million active users** are from US. Due to Amazon\u2019s global scope and reach, it is also considered one of the most valuable brand worldwide. This also means that PayPal got to access to Amazon users and the payments can be done through PayPal's Venmo wallets. This is going to be the biggest revenue source going forward.\n\n**4. Plenty of room to grow in the ecommerce space**\n\nThere is still plenty of runway for growth in electronic payments. Electronic payments only surpassed cash payments on a global basis a couple of years especially during the pandemic period where the baby boomer started to explore the online and as well as developing countries who started to use online and more of the payment services. Over the years, PayPal had built a good reputation on the payment services for being highly secured and as well as bringing conveniences.\n\n**5. Unique business Model - ability to combat fraud**\n\nI believe this area is critical, no one wishes their credit/debit card information to be leaked or to be hacked and misused. **Using PayPal is extremely secured.**\n\nPayPal have this unique business model centers around a two-sided platform, with PayPal enjoying relationships with both merchants and consumers. This approach has material benefits and was instrumental in allowing PayPal to develop its current foothold in the industry. Having information on both sides of the transaction gives PayPal a meaningful edge in combating fraud, which was a very meaningful factor in the early days of the Internet, and remains a key issue.\n\nWith an ability to combat fraud, PayPal was in a position to become a valued partner on both sides of a payment. (Source: Morningstar) With this feature, I will always opt to have my items checkout using PayPal if there is an option for it because I know it will be highly secured.\n\n**6. Who owns PayPal, who are the shareholders?**\n\nPayPal are mostly institutional/ fund houses which make up of 82%. This means that many mutual funds or pension funds have invested PayPal for their long term value. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI believe with such a mega cap company, well established company and with lots of potential to grow. No doubt, they might face some competition from square, Apple pay and Alipay but PayPal has already a huge and stable customer based (377 million active users) and they will have the potential to grow even more as popularity on online payments grew. At the current price, it is not expensive.",

        "selftext": "Here are the final Parts 8-10, of an article addressing the main bear arguments on Paysafe.  Parts 1-7 covered Paysafe\u2019s outlook on growth, debt, and profit, along with insider ownership and competition.  I recommend starting with the [introduction in Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qlw7ro/peeling_back_the_layers_on_paysafe_psfe_parts_57/) (Growth), and following the links from there if still interested.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 8. Management\n\nAs part of Paysafe\u2019s preparations for the next phase of growth, the company has undergone a complete management overhaul. Along with replacing nearly all the Board of Directors, in the last two years, they\u2019ve hired a new CEO, new CFO, new CTO, new CIO, new CRO and new CISO. They\u2019ve hired PayPal\u2019s Chief Risk Officer and have also filled key division CEO positions with Facebook\u2019s Head of Payments and Amazon Intl\u2019s Head of Payments.  This does not sound like an operation with a passive outlook.\n\nStill, many are rightfully frustrated that management has done little publicly to support the share price since going public. Despite a steady supply of [positive news](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/oak2jx/paysafes_value_creation_trajectory_is_very_much/), the CEO has not once meaningfully engaged the media to highlight Paysafe\u2019s value story.  It may be that management is deliberately downplaying its messaging while shares move from short-term trader\u2019s hands to those of value-seeking funds in order to better secure long-term share value.  Or, they are simply focused on producing the numbers.\n\nRegardless, what management may lack in public storytelling, it makes up for in execution. In the short time since they went public, they have announced 3 new acquisitions and over 25 expanded partnerships with the likes of [Visa](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/skrill-usa-launches-skrill-virtual-visar-prepaid-card-in-us/), [Coinbase](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-issues-coinbase-s-new-visa-debit-card-enabling-easier-cryptocurrency-spending/), [Fubo Gaming](https://www.paysafe.com/eu-en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-streamlines-payments-for-interactive-wagering-with-fubo-gaming-in-us/), [FOXbet](https://www.njgamblingfun.com/nj/sports-news/paysafe-continues-its-push-into-online-gaming), [Golden Nugget](http://www.greensheet.com/newswire.php?newswire_id=53685), [Bankable](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-partners-with-bankable-to-provide-omnichannel-banking-services/), [Wix](https://www.pymnts.com/digital-payments/2021/smbs-can-accept-payments-with-paysafe-skrill-on-wix/), [Repay](https://www.repay.com/repay-partners-with-paysafe-to-enable-u-s-merchants-to-accept-online-cash-payments/), [WynnBet](https://www.electronicpaymentsinternational.com/news/wynnbet-taps-paysafe-for-payments-and-marketing-solutions/), [Betfred USA](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-expands-betfred-usa-sports-partnership-through-income-access-deal/), [OwnersBox](https://incomeaccess.com/contenthub/ownersbox-launches-affiliate-program/), [Dutch neobank bunq](https://www.paysafe.com/eu-en/paysafegroup/news/detail/bunq-partners-with-paysafe-to-enable-cash-deposits-for-digital-banking/), [IntelliPay](https://intellipay.com/paysafe-expands-us-partnership-with-intellipayto-offer-online-cash-payments/), Glory Ltd, Parx Interactive, TripGift, SweePay, SimplePayMe, [Smart Property Systems](https://globalfintechseries.com/banking/digital-payments/paysafe-partners-with-smart-property-systems-in-north-america/), Ambassador Cruise Line, Shelby Financial, ResponseCRM, ZEN, [Montana Lottery](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-powers-online-payments-for-montana-lotterys-sportsbook/), PlayUP, [SuperBook Sports](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-platform-launches-with-superbook-sports-in-colorado-and-new-jersey/) and [Bitrise](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-accelerates-innovation-with-bitrise-for-faster-digital-wallets-payments/).\n\nIn that same period, they\u2019ve also:\n\n* expanded their US launch of digital wallet Skrill to [48 states](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafes-skrill-expands-its-crypto-service/),\n* expanded their digital wallets to [trade](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafes-neteller-launches-fiat-to-crypto-withdrawal-service/) 38 \\[digital\\]currencies and 40 global fiat currencies\n* launched online cash payments on Microsoft\u2019s [Xbox](https://www.pymnts.com/news/payment-methods/2021/xbox-gamers-can-now-pay-with-cash-online-with-paysafe/) in 22 countries\n* struck deals with [Snowflake](https://www.atmmarketplace.com/news/paysafe-integrates-snowflake-to-power-cloud-based-approach-for-enhanced-customer-experiences/) and Amazon\u2019s [AWS](https://www.electronicpaymentsinternational.com/news/paysafe-partners-aws-to-become-cloud-based-payments-provider/) to support its migration to a cloud-based platform as part of their strategy to scale quickly and leverage data to drive customer acquisition,\n* [launched](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-launches-safeguarding-model-for-the-travel-industry-globally/) a new global travel safeguarding model,\n* a unique innovation that quickly led to a new [deal](https://www.paysafe.com/eu-en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-and-arc-partner-to-deliver-innovative-payments-solution-for-airlines/) with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally.\n\nAlso during this time, they announced the appointments of:\n\n* Digital wallet division CEO, [Chirag Patel](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-appoints-chirag-patel-to-lead-its-digital-wallets-division/) (fmr Head of Payments at Amazon Intl., Santander)\n* North American iGaming CEO, [Zak Cutler](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-appoints-zak-cutler-to-lead-its-north-america-igaming-business/) (fmr DraftKings exec),\n* Boardmember [Mark Brooker](https://fxnewsgroup.com/forex-news/executives/paysafe-appoints-mark-brooker-as-non-exec-director/) (fmr COO Betfair, non-exec dir. William Hill)\n\nAll that done while reporting a profitable quarter, beating on revenue and EPS consensus, reporting 41% total payment volume (TPV) growth, refinancing all debt for significant cost savings, after putting deals in place throughout North America to lead in any new iGaming market as soon as it opens (as just happened with their 100% positioning in Canada\u2019s [newly opened](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/canada-legalizes-single-game-sports-191629457.html) sports betting market).  As Bill Foley said, \u201cwe\u2019re seeding the future growth right now\u2026 The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective\u2026It\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\u201d  They have not slept on this promise even as they quietly lay the groundwork to do the same thing in South America.\n\nLastly, major shareholder and Paysafe Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley has repeatedly proven himself to be a trusted and highly effective deal maker with a remarkably consistent track record in growing shareholder value.  Bloomberg describes Foley as someone who prides himself on operating experience, who has a known talent for corporate maneuvering and brings with him a full team of seasoned financial managers.\n\nThe types of acquisitions described in Part 1 are central to Paysafe\u2019s \u201cvalue creation playbook\u201d which is exactly how Foley, grew FIS 36x from a market cap of $2.5 billion to over $90 billion. From the beginning of the deal to bring Paysafe public, Foley [said](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/user_upload/Foley-Trasimene-Acquisition-Corp-II-and-Paysafe-investor-call-Final.pdf), \u201cthose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe... FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe \u2013 an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell.\u201d\n\nIn this context, it\u2019s worth underscoring Foley\u2019s undeniably history of simultaneously growing multiple companies.  Over just the last six years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3x, Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6x, and Black Knight 8.7x. He\u2019s also known for growing Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion (3,600x). In all cases, he has significantly expanded their margins between 500 to 1800 bps. Foley said, \u201cMy whole history and career has been around acquiring companies and fixing companies.\u201d  Though he\u2019s not Paysafe\u2019s front man, his fingerprints are evident and IR has recently assured that \u201c  Bill is highly engaged with the company.\u201d Personally, I don\u2019t doubt it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 9. Lockup Expiration\n\nSome bears still point to PSFE overhang from lockups but all share lockups expired months ago, except for founder shares which constitute about 4% of outstanding shares ([20F p. 135](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1833835/000119312521104105/d159702d20f.htm#toc)). That lockup is expected to expire in December. Personally, lockup expiry of such a small percentage of shares is not deterring me from continuing to build a position before Paysafe starts reporting better numbers. This is especially true when those shares are controlled by Chairman Foley, who is central to Paysafe\u2019s value creation playbook. Between Foley\u2019s consistent track record, the proxy statement below and Blackstone\u2019s stance on future growth, all signs indicate a long-term hold.\n\nUpon approving the deal to bring Paysafe public, the founders identified \u201cbase returns for a four year hold period\u201d of \u201c2.9x to 3.8x\u201d from $10.\n\nFrom their proxy statement (SEC filing-[DEFM14A](https://pdf.secdatabase.com/2681/0001193125-21-060961.pdf)): \u201cThe Business Combination could provide base returns for a four year hold period assuming exit multiples between 20-25x next twelve month EBITDA, reflecting a range of internal rate of return of 30.9% to 39.2% and a multiple on invested capital of 2.9x to 3.8x, in each case, based on the FTAC initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, while recognizing that the achievement of such returns could not be assured, and that the Business Combination has similar characteristics to other transactions involving Mr. Foley in the financial technologies industry, including an attractive platform with a defensible market position and multiple attractive acquisition opportunities to strengthen market position further, each of which made PGHL an attractive investment for FTAC.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 10. Valuation\n\nPaysafe is building an integrated architecture that is worth more than the sum of its parts.  By leveraging an asset-light cloud-based model to efficiently scale up in new high growth markets globally, Paysafe is a perfect example of the low capex Fintech profile that generally warrants high valuation multiples.\n\nNow trading around 4x a conservative F2022 revenue with nearly every institutional owner\u2019s cost basis 20-40% higher than the current price, it would appear PSFE is severely undervalued. Perhaps because Paysafe didn't go public via the traditional IPO method it is being lumped in with highly speculative pre-revenue ventures.  But Paysafe is anything but that.\n\nOr maybe the current low price is simply a reflection of broadly disseminated misleading information like the articles on debt quoted in Part 2 or like the several articles falsely claiming Paysafe went public at a 3x higher valuation above its 2017 take private price. Some articles claim this by mistaking British pounds for US dollars while a Yahoo Finance article claimed a \"300% higher\" valuation with bad math and a false comparison between enterprise value (inclusive of debt) and a misquoted 2017 market cap price of \u201c$3.7 billion\u201d, exclusive of debt.  Inclusive of debt (enterprise value), Paysafe was taken private for $4.7 billion, according to [Reuters.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/qfopku/credit_suisse_revised_to_neutral_detail/)  To make its bear case, that article misquotes the relevant 2017 take private value by a full billion dollars.\n\nInitially, I wondered why just about every bearish article relied on faulty or misleading information to make its valuation case, or why so many platforms misreported PSFE\u2019s financial data, like YF\u2019s overstating a Q1 EPS miss as -0.23 EPS instead of -0.05 (fixed months later); or why does a [Credit Suisse analyst](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/qfopku/credit_suisse_revised_to_neutral_detail/) offer new price targets 4 times in 5 months with the first change just two days after initiating coverage and the last change, to neutral, just two weeks before Q3ER.  Instead of waiting a few days for new data highly relevant to his thesis, the analyst cites, as if Q2 were a new revelation, months old information most of which was available before he first initiated coverage. (Coincidentally, he issued this two minutes before pre-market, precisely when PSFE was on the verge of breaking above the confluence of its 9-month downtrend resistance line and the 50DMA).  Negligence or intentional price manipulation, take your pick.  Skeptics may cringe at this idea but this is really nothing new.  It\u2019s not like the market is [unaware](https://www.sec.gov/tm/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsanalystshtm.html) of analyst [conflicts of interest](https://web.williams.edu/Economics/Honors/2004/MSirignanoThesis.pdf) or that Credit Suisse has shown itself to be an upstanding market participant (think lawsuit for misleading investors on [Archegos](https://fortune.com/2021/07/29/credit-suisse-report-archegos-loss-bank-massive-culture-problem/), [$5.3B fine](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/23/deutsche-bank-and-credit-suisse-agree-billion-dollar-fines-with-us-authorities.html) for mortgage backed securities,[$2.5B fine](https://cn.reuters.com/article/uk-creditsuisse-investigation-idUKKBN0E00WM20140520) after pleading guilty for aiding in tax fraud, and the recent [$547M fine](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/credit-suisse-resolves-fraudulent-mozambique-loan-case-547-million-coordinated-global) after admitting to regulatory breaches, secret loans, lying to authorities and spying on employees). On the other hand, this could be CS trying to clean up its act by playing it safe or an analyst trying to preserve his reputation by keeping price targets closer to market.  If so, this may have the flip-side benefit of future incremental upgrades.\n\nObviously, this is all conjecture, which really doesn\u2019t matter in the long run.\n\nTrue price discovery will take form as share rotation plays out and Paysafe's value story becomes clear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUntil then, here are a few reference points:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking at Paysafe\u2019s eCash segment as a separate company:\n\nThe eCash segment is a high margin business with over 12 million active users, $5 billion in volume, $405 million in TTM revenue and $157 million EBITDA. For H1/21, they just reported 49.4% YoY revenue growth and 81.6% YoY EBITDA growth. Not many Fintech companies can claim that.\n\nAdyen is a Fintech with a similar growth profile, (46% YoY revenue growth and 27% YoY EBITDA growth). Applying Adyen\u2019s 19x EV/rev ratio to Paysafe\u2019s eCash business alone, would give it a $7.6 billion enterprise value. That\u2019s close to the current valuation of the entirety of Paysafe, yet this one segment represents less than a third of total revenue.\n\nUsing Adyen\u2019s EV/EBITDA ratio of 149x would value Paysafe\u2019s eCash segment at $23.3 billion. Even when applying the company\u2019s entire debt to that one segment, the share price for just the eCash business alone would still be $26.62.\n\nAgain, that represents less than a third of Paysafe\u2019s total business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBrick &amp; Mortar Payment Processing\n\nPaysafe is a value play right now but bears focus on growth.  Paysafe has an established history of 27-30% CAGR but because recent growth was temporarily stifled by China de-risking exits and Covid-related closures, some equally hard-hit brick &amp; mortar payment processing partners, like Visa and Mastercard, offer an interesting comparison.\n\nFor 2020, Visa reported negative YoY revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%). Similarly, Mastercard reported negative YoY revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%). Their forward growth is projected to be 7.7% and 10% respectively.\n\nIn all forward growth metrics, including EBITDA and EPS, they do worse than Paysafe, yet they both trade at an EV/Rev multiple of roughly 24X.  This would put PSFE at $41.80.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDigital Wallet vs. Digital Wallet\n\nMany compare the #1 digital wallet, PayPal, to the #2 digital wallet, Paysafe, so, hopefully without striking a nerve, here\u2019s a deeper look into that comparison:\n\nAs noted earlier, Paysafe\u2019s stock was recently clobbered down 30% (to 3.2x P/S) on soft Q3 guidance even though they reaffirmed full year guidance and beat consensus on revenue and EPS.\n\nBy comparison, PayPal missed Q3 guidance for both revenue and EPS. PayPal was also reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance AND they missed on Q2 revenue consensus while also reporting a -23%YoY decline on EPS. PYPL only went down 10% (from a lofty 15x P/S) as news outlets characterized PayPal\u2019s troubles as a \u201cbuying opportunity.\u201d\n\nSome will reasonably say that\u2019s because PayPal has such strong growth history but, from the time PayPal\u2019s numbers were available separately from its parent eBay, 2012-2020, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR ([$5.6b](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal) to [$21.5b](https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/Q4-FY-20-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf)). In that same period, Paysafe has grown 30.5% CAGR ([$169m](https://www.investing.com/analysis/optimal-payments:-still-at-discount-despite-ebitda-growth-137908) to [$1.43b](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_60f30e3ae06e5db5459655316a65dc97/paysafe/db/1111/9761/file/Supplemental+Financial+Information_+Paysafe+Limited_+Q1+2021.xlsx)).\n\nPaysafe reported 27%CAGR prior to 2020\u2019s restructuring and, in just the last year, when excluding Paysafe\u2019s 2020 de-risking exits, they reported 23% YoY growth for Q2 which is on par with PayPal\u2019s recent report of 19% YoY growth. This comparative history serves only to show that Paysafe has a strong track record that should not be discounted.\n\nPaysafe is still priced as if it is a zero growth, pre-revenue speculative venture. Meanwhile, though some have called PayPal a \u201cfree cash flow machine,\u201d Paysafe already generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal (25% FCF margin vs. 20% FCF margin).\n\nThere\u2019s obviously more to this complex story but, for reference, below is PSFE potential share value when applying PYPL\u2019s multiples (now 25% off highs) when factoring in all of PSFE\u2019s potential acquisition debt and dilution:\n\n* PayPal\u2019s EV/FCF ratio of 66.9X puts PSFE at $33.10\n* PayPal\u2019s EV/EBITDA ratio of 44.3X puts PSFE at $24.90\n* PayPal\u2019s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X puts PSFE at $28.40.\n* PayPal\u2019s EV/Rev ratio of 12.4x puts PSFE at $20.75\n* PayPal\u2019s free cash flow yield of 1.7% puts PSFE at $29.41\n\nThose metrics average to a share price of $27.31\n\nWhen factoring in a potential 24% growth, 35% EBITDA margin, 75-80% FCF conversion, the potential share value climbs fairly quickly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSector multiples:\n\nBecause Paysafe is far more diversified than the average Fintech, a while back I compared it to a wide basket of Fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. Collectively, they have a \\~12.5% growth rate. Unlike Paysafe, a third of this group reported negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA and half reported negative EBITDA growth. Paysafe also currently has better EPS and a better Debt/EBITDA ratio than over half the group.\n\nAfter removing the top-end outliers in each category that put PSFE above $100 and discounting all by an additional 10%, here\u2019s Paysafe\u2019s share price with the averaged peer multiples:\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $45.67\n* EV/Rev ratio : $40.17\n* EV/FCF ratio : $39.72\n\nAverage : $41.84\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's worth pointing out here that, as happened with FIS\u2019s tremendous growth history, stock prices tend to temporarily pull back in association with acquisitions. This may explain some of PSFE\u2019s recent price action, but certainly not all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSure, it\u2019s easy to read all of the material in Parts 1-10 and say, \u201cthe market doesn\u2019t care,\u201d but I\u2019m confident that\u2019ll change when share rotation settles and quarterly ER\u2019s gradually shift focus from the past to the future.  Stripped of superficial misdirection, bear arguments often devolve down to variations of \u201clook at the chart\u201d and \u201cprice is truth.\u201d  This has been said about many companies in the past as they position themselves for future growth.\n\nNo, this is not the next Amazon but Bezos had it right when he said, \u201cThe stock is not the company. And the company is not the stock. ... And so, while the stock price was going the wrong way, everything inside the company was going the right way.\u201d\n\nDo with this what you will. These are simply observations. Feel free to correct any errors, point out things I missed or use this material any way you wish. To be perfectly clear, this is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor nor am I associated in any way with any commercial interests beyond my own.  Given how much disinformation has been out there, I thought I\u2019d do my bit to peel back the layers on what I consider to be a reliable long term investment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis concludes our public service announcement. We now return to normal programming.",

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, November 19, 2021**\n\nThe stock market traded mixed today, with the both the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) slipping whiled the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) outperformed on the day, driven higher by a strong performance in mega-caps like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and NVIDIA (NVDA). Market participants continue to digest mixed economic data, with retail sales surprising to the upside despite the fastest pace of inflation in roughly 30 years. Moreover, market participants are growing increasingly concerned about a wave of new COVID with new restrictions announced in Europe and cases in the US ticking back higher after two consecutive months of declines.\n\nNotable Numbers Today\n\n* SPY: -0.19%\n* QQQ: +0.56%\n* DIA: -0.76%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): -0.91%\n* Apple (AAPL): +1.70%\n* NVIDIA (NVDA): +4.14%\n* Roblox (RBLX): +6.82%\n* PayPal (PYPL): -3.44%\n* Lucid Motors (LCID): 17.34%\n\nMarkets were unsettled after a slew of European countries announced new COVID-related restrictions as the winter holidays begin. The Austrian government announced a full lockdown starting Monday in response to surging COVID cases. The lockdown will include both those vaccinated and unvaccinated, it will last for 10 days minimum, but could be extended for 10 days further. \n\nJim Reid, Chief Economist at Deutsche Bank, said \u201calthough all the headlines are in Europe at the moment, will the U.S. be more vulnerable than many European countries over the course of the full winter? Recent history suggests the U.S. has a higher bar for economic restrictions related to covid but it also has a lower vaccination rate than their European peers.\u201d\n\nIn particular, the price of oil sank by over 3%, reflecting jitters that lockdowns will curb energy demand. However, Goldman Sachs said \u201cJust like with headlines on Wednesday, we estimate this move lower has far overshot the actual fundamental risk due to low trading volumes.\n\nAdding another wrench in the plans, President Biden is expected to announce his nominee to be the Chair of the Fed. So far, the two main candidates are incumbent Jerome Powell and current Fed Governor Lael Brainard. \n\nYesterday, the Labor Department\u2019s Weekly Unemployment Report came in slightly higher than expected but still eked out a new pandemic-era low. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **Initial unemployment claims, week ended November 13:** 268,000 vs. 260,000 expected and an upwardly revised 269,000 during prior week \n* **Continuing claims, week ended November 5:** 2.080 million vs. 2.120 million expected and an upwardly revised 2.209 million during prior week\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The FDA approved boosters of the Pfizer/BioNTech (PFE, BNTX) and Moderna (MRNA) COVID-19 vaccines for all adults in the US.\n* Apple regained the mantle of most valuable company from Microsoft, with the company reaching a fresh all-time high today\n* After a pop in the beginning of November, weed stocks continued their steep declines as nationwide legalization efforts in the US continue to falter. The largest fund tracking the pot industry, ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (MJ) tumbled to its lowest price since last year and is down 60% from its high in February.\n* As talked about yesterday, Apple (AAPL) is reportedly accelerating development on its fully autonomous Apple Car, set to debut in 2025. A Morgan Stanley analyst said the car would double revenues and market value.\n* The Pentagon announced it has issued formal solicitations to Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), and Oracle (ORCL) for a multibillion-dollar cloud-computing contract to replace the JEDI procurement, which became mired in litigation between Microsoft and Amazon and objections from Congress.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Applied Materials (AMAT) with a host of target raises following its earnings report.

        "selftext": "In an experience that taught me the limitations of stop limit orders, I am currently holding PayPal stock at a significant loss (bought near the ATH). And some call options that are negative, in a move that will optimistically be \u201cbuying the dip\u201d or less optimistically \u201cthrowing good money after bad.\u201d\n\nAny insights on what\u2019s going on here? Original drop was because of earnings. Then it went down from there. Next was the Pinterest rumor drop. Then a temporary increase when they backed away from that idea (when I stupidly missed an opportunity to profit on an option), only to then drop further. I\u2019m worried about what will happen to the stock when earnings are announced next week.",
