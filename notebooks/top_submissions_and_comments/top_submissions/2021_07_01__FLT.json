They will have to go through a company that has a Canadian license like Drone Delivery Canada. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/parcel-drone-delivery/](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/parcel-drone-delivery/)\n\n&gt; revenue from parcel drone delivery could total $113 billion by 2030 \n\nArk invest predicts that just parcel drone delivery could be $113 billion by 2030. This doesn't include business to business cargo I assume. Drone delivery Canada has LOI's with foreign companies in India, and Kenya off the top of my head. If drone delivery Canada can capture just 1% of this industries potential then it could have over 1 billion in revenue by 2030.",
