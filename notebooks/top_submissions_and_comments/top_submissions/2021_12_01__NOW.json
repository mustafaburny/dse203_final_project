        "selftext": "Read until end: \n\nI wanted to tell this story because I figured some apes would find it amusing and to give a heads up to anyone still using Robinghood or margin. \n\nToday I received my first margin call liquidation. My balance was skimming the line and I was hoping it would bounce and it didn\u2019t. To begin, yes I am retarded but second, **do not let brokers exercise a margin call on you**. Get money in your account, cover that F***ing call or they **will** fuck you. They will not exercise their liquidation with any form of rational or ethical discretion and **will** make the worst sales possible to cost you the most amount of money possible.\n\n\nNow, for the story.\n\n\nToday at 10:38 a.m. Robbinghood liquidated 180 shares in my account netting me a $600 loss. \n\n\nAt the same time they handed me this loss, they could have instead exercised the decision to liquidate a different position of mine. A position which would have covered the same amount of margin due and only accounted for a total loss of $2. Not $2 per share but 4 shares (as opposed to 180) for a total $2 loss.\n\nI called customer service and asked them what the f*** made them decide that was an ethical way to liquidate. They agreed it was bad judgment, agreed they could correct it and then told me that despite both of these points they won\u2019t (I am dead serious).\n\nThe cherry on top? The stocks RobbingHood sold at a massive loss were RobbingHood shares. That\u2019s right. I took a chance on their shit company, they sucked and then penalized me for their suck. What a spit in the face.\n\nTo end on a positive note, I just liquidated my entire account and switched to WeBull closing my RH account, forever. Let this be a warning to all those who like me, ignored the warnings of so many on here.",

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/smallstreetbets sub! Welcome to the first trading day of December! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Wednesday, December 1st, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures jump ahead of first trading day of December after omicron fears dent markets](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/30/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n&gt; U.S. stock futures were higher in early trading Wednesday, as companies that benefit from the economic reopening gained along with big energy and pharma.\n*****\n&gt; Dow futures rose 305 points. S&amp;P 500 futures gained 1.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 1.4%.\n*****\n&gt; The gains follow a Tuesday sell-off on Wall Street over fears about the new omicron Covid variant and the Federal Reserve mulling a quicker-than-planned exit from its easy monetary policy.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury yields also moved notably higher, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury note most recently back near 1.5% after falling 8 basis points Tuesday to 1.45% on fears that the pandemic would stifle economic growth.\n*****\n&gt; Merck led gainers on the S&amp;P 500, rising 4% in premarket trading a day after its Covid treatment pill received approval from the Food and Drug Administration, though by a narrow 13-10 margin.\n*****\n&gt; Energy shares also posted sharp gains, with Occidental Petroleum up 3.4% as West Texas Intermediate prices climbed more than 4% to nearly $69 a barrel.\n*****\n&gt; Elsewhere in early trading, stocks associated with the economic reopening also posted strong gains. Carnival was up 2.9%, Wynn Resorts gained 2.6% and Hilton Worldwide saw a 2.8% gain.\n*****\n&gt; The moves came a day after the Dow lost more than 650 points, the S&amp;P 500 shed 1.9% and the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite dipped 1.6%. The small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 tumbled 1.9% as cyclical names dragged on the markets.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOur sense is that the recent selloff is a longer-term buying opportunity. However, investors that want to avoid a potential big drawdown (while giving up some potential upside) may want to wait until the [Fed\u2019s] Dec. 15 meeting,\u201d Wolfe Research strategist Chris Senyek said in a note to clients.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell jolted markets after he said the central bank is expected to discuss speeding up the taper of its minimum $120 billion a month bond-buying program. Despite the potential disruption of omicron, the Fed chief said he thinks reducing the pace of monthly bond buys can move quicker than the $15 billion-a-month schedule announced earlier this month.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAt this point, the economy is very strong and inflationary pressures are higher, and it is therefore appropriate in my view to consider wrapping up the taper of our asset purchases ... perhaps a few months sooner,\u201d Powell said. \u201cI expect that we will discuss that at our upcoming meeting.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Goldman Sachs said it projects the Fed will double the pace to $30 billion a month and enact its first rate hike of the pandemic era in June.\n*****\n&gt; The major averages have seen several volatile sessions, starting last Friday when the Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced its worst day since October 2020. Stocks rebounded on Monday, only to turn downward again on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; Wednesday marks the first trading day of the final month of 2021.\n*****\n&gt; Expediting the removal of the Fed\u2019s easy policies tells investors that the central bank is focusing on addressing inflation, instead of new threats from the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMarkets appear to be having trouble digesting the combo of elevated uncertainty around the impact of the Omicron variant and a hawkish Fed pivot in the context of persistently elevated inflation,\u201d said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.\n*****\n&gt; The new Covid variant, first detected in South Africa, has now been identified in more than a dozen countries, causing many to restrict travel. Denting sentiment on Tuesday, the Moderna CEO told the Financial Times that he expects existing vaccines to be less effective against the new variant.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks wrapped up a volatile month of trading on Tuesday. The Dow lost 3.7% for its second month of losses in three. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.25% in November. The Russell 2000 shed 4.3% in November, its worst month since March 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Still, the major averages are up solidly for the year. The Dow is up 12.7% and the S&amp;P 500 is up 21.6% in 2021. The Nasdaq Composite is up an impressive 20.6% this year.\n*****\n&gt; ADP\u2019s private payroll data for November showed 534,000 jobs added in November, above expectations of 506,000\n*****\n&gt; On Wednesday, investors will be evaluating updates on the omicron variant, as well as some key economic reports. November\u2019s Manufacturing PMI, ISM Manufacturing print and October\u2019s construction spending are set to release on Wednesday morning.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/8Kedb0c.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CZnVYrP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/XAbNcjb.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Jml9Z5I.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/5KwRD2M.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($LI $CRM $CRWD $DOCU $SNOW $AI $DG $MRVL $ZS $ASAN $OKTA $ULTA $AMBA $NTAP $SIG $EXPR $HPE $BBW $BQ $BNS $JKS $FRO $MOMO $HIBB $SPLK $SWBI $QH $RY $CHS $BZUN $FIVE $BOX $VERU $YJ $KR $CTRN $TD $VEEV $BIG $GMS $DOOO $CM $EMKR $PVH)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/5ocvp67.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($CRM $ZS $AMBA $NTAP $HPE $BBW $BOX $RY $EMKR $DOOO $GIII $REX $DCI $PDCO $GFS $AIP $VBNK $SDIG)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/lCtopUt.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/o7ET4fR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/odyatZm.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rIUTfTU.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/X0CaSOZ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/paTa9DS.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/6LhmSMe.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/NQh0VqW.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/lNszsgs.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/TQK2vhS.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/kZvQYzi.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/m6LPOsg.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* BYSI\n* REQ.X\n* VXRT\n* NIO\n* AAPL\n* MATIC.X\n* ATNF\n* AERC\n* OP\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/01/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-salesforce-allbirds-doordash-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Salesforce** \u2014 Shares of the software giant dropped more than 6% in premarket trading despite a better-than-expected third-quarter earnings report.

The deal woud leave Rumble with $300 million in cash, the company said in a statement announcing the transaction on Wednesday evening. It hopes to complete the process by the second quarter of next year.\n\nThe Cantor Fitzgerald investment vehicle, which already trades publicly under the CFVI ticker, saw its shares rise Thursday, increasing by nearly 25% to $12.\n\nRumble, which was founded in 2013, bills itself as a \u201ctrue neutral platform\u201d but has become a popular site among those who say they unfairly limit speech.\n\n\u201cRumble is designed to be the rails and independent infrastructure that is immune to cancel culture,\u201d Rumble CEO and founder Chris Pavlovski said a statement. \u201cWe are a movement that does not stifle, censor, or punish creativity and believe everyone benefits from access to a neutral network with diverse ideas and opinions.\u201d\n\nRumble exploded in popularity following Trump\u2019s 2020 presidential election loss with its monthly users rising from around 2 million to over 20 million at the end of last year. The site now attracts nearly 40 million such users. An investor prospectus for the SPAC highlights figures such as Dan Bongino, Rep. Devin Nunes, and Glenn Greenwald.",

        "selftext": "New Feasibility Study Announced by U.S. Gold (USAU) at Their CK Gold Project Could Launch the Company to a New Level\n\n**U.S. Gold Corp. (NASDAQ: USAU)**\u00a0is a gold exploration and development company.\n\nCurrent price $11.14/share (+ 3.4% as of 1:00 P.M. EST 12-2-21)\n\nAfter closing at $10.80/share in Wednesday\u2019s session, USAU shares opened at $11.01 today. The shares reached $11.50 quickly and traded volume in the first 30 minutes was 33K shares.\n\nIn a\u00a0[press release today](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-gold-corp-provides-access-133000423.html), Mr. George Bee, the Company's President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, reminded us that the PFS assumes $1,625 per gold ounce and $3.25 per pound for copper, based on a weighted average of historic prices and consensus forward looking price (see PFS for a full explanation). Gold and copper prices today are around $1,800/ounce and $4.25/pound respectively.\n\nAlliance Global Partners, one of the analysts following USAU released the following statement and increased target price today \u201cIncreasing Target on Robust CK Gold Project PFS; Feasibility Study and Permitting On-Deck\u201d AGP further outlined their position:\n\nOn December 1, 2021, USAU announced a positive Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS) for its CK Gold Project in Wyoming. In our view, the PFS outlined a robust project featuring low-cost production of over 100,000 gold equivalent ounces per annum over a 10-year mine life. Given the project's production profile of over 100,000 ounces of gold per year, strategic location in the United States, manageable CapEx, and accelerated permitting timeline, we view the CK Project as an attractive asset that warrants development. Further, we note that much of the heavy lifting related to Feasibility level work has already been completed, which should accelerate the project's development timeline. As such, we are reiterating our Buy rating and\u00a0**increasing our price target to $25.00**\u00a0from $20.00 per share. Here is a link to the\u00a0[full analysts report](https://europac.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=384226a3-5f14-49c7-8061-bf580613cd8d&amp;mime=pdf&amp;co=Europac&amp;id=jsekelsky@allianceg.com&amp;source=mail).\n\n**The new feasibility Study is the biggest news, and potential catalyst I\u2019ve ever seen come from this company. I\u2019m keeping in mind that USAU has four gold mining projects and CK Gold is one of them with a Net Present Value of $323M. The company\u2019s market value is under $80M.**\n\nThis new\u00a0[information about the CK Gold Property](https://www.usgoldcorp.gold/news-media/press-releases/detail/142/u-s-gold-corp-announces-positive-prefeasibility-study)\u00a0establishes a clear path for a mining operation with a Net Present Value of $323M and an Internal Rate of Return at 39.4%. Those are substantial numbers to achieve for an initial investment of $221M.\n\nWe\u2019ve gotten some technical question about the prefeasibility report from our well-informed members. While\u00a0[the press release](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-gold-corp-announces-positive-141500367.html)\u00a0goes into substantial detail, we wanted to link the\u00a0[Technical Report Summary](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_f533b074cecd42b4e3eb4ca58d5307a2/usgoldcorp/db/332/2068/pdf/CK+Gold+SK-1300+PFS+TRS+Dec+2021.pdf)\u00a0provided by USAU as well. I believe any questions regarding the prefeasibility study can be addressed within the technical report. USAU has several geologists and technical advisors on board and while the company drilled the core samples, much of the data presented has been consolidated and verified by outside sources.\n\nThe possibilities for USAU now are encouraging and range from an inflow of money for a mining operation that leads to revenues and a substantial bottom line, to a potential exit to a larger gold miner.\n\n**original report below from 12-2-21 9:00 AM Eastern**\n\n**A just released feasibility study indicates huge potential gold reserves.**\n\nGood day everyone,\n\n**U.S. Gold Corp. (NASDAQ: USAU)**\u00a0is a gold exploration and development company.\n\nCurrent price $10.76/share (at market close 11-30-21)\n\nIt\u2019s been a while since we talked about a junior gold miner. We\u2019ve talked about USAU before, but it was in January of this year. I wanted to talk about them now to update you about events at the company and because turmoil in the economy can impact gold prices, driving them higher. Higher gold prices usually improve the value of gold miners at all levels.\n\n**Some considerations for USAU:**\n\n38% off 52-week high Copper &amp; gold prices are strong Tiny share structure Analysts indicate 68% to 150% potential upside Fresh PFS with great results\n\nI want to note that\u00a0[USAU shares](https://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=USAU)\u00a0have just broken through their 20 SMA, 50 SMA and 200 SMA of $10.24, $10.19, and $10.54 respectively. With a 52-week high of $17.40/share, a near term breakout may be indicated.\n\nGold is a traditional haven for investors that are uncertain of the near-term fortunes of the economy. I talked to you earlier about moves that the Fed is contemplating to tamp down inflation. Potentially discontinuing the purchase of treasuries and mortgage-backed securities along with the other weapon in the Fed arsenal, raising interest rates. These kinds of Fed actions are designed to slow the economy and may drive investors to increase their gold positions. That is good news for USAU.\n\nThe current price of gold is $1,787/ounce and the 2021 range has been $1,684 - $1,951/ounce.\n\nUSAU presents with a tiny share structure with only 7.09M shares outstanding and 6.76M shares in the float. Insiders hold 13.32% of the outstanding shares and institutions hold 11.79% which seems significant for a development stage company.\n\nThe company has a FYE of April 30th,\u00a0so they are operating in their Q3 right now. At the end of Q1 (July 31) the company reported cash of $10.7M\n\n8/20/2021 HC Wainwright Reiterated Rating Buy $15.504/8/2021 Alliance Global Lower Price Target Buy $20.00The consensus price target level from the analysts above is $17.75 indicating a possible upside of 65%.\n\nToday I want to outline the company\u2019s flagship property, the CK Gold Project located in Wyoming, just west of Cheyenne. The property comprises about 1,120 acres and is\u00a0**100% owned by U.S. Gold Corp.**\u00a0Here\u2019s a link to a\u00a0[short video](https://www.usgoldcorp.gold/properties/ck-gold-project/overview)\u00a0about the project.\n\n12-1-21: USAU\u00a0[just released news](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-gold-corp-announces-positive-141500367.html)\u00a0that it has completed the prefeasibility study (PFS) for the Company's CK Gold Project and has published its SK-1300 Technical Report Summary. A pre-feasibility study determines whether a probable mineral reserve is economically viable and determines whether the reserve can be economically mined. Here are the highlights:\n\nMineral Resources \u2013 1.58 million gold equivalent (\"AuEq\") ounces of Measured and Indicated (M+I) Resources\n\nMineral Reserves \u2013 1.44 million AuEq ounces of Proven and Probable (P1 and P2) Reserves\n\n10-year Mine Life at 20,000 short tons per day process rate\n\nInitial Capital: $221 million\n\nRobust Economics \u2013 39.4% IRR before tax and 33.7% IRR after tax\n\nUpside Potential\n\nPermitting and Development\n\nDevelopment Plan Progress Highlights:\n\n2021 Field Season \u2013 a successful field season concluded November 2021\n\nOngoing Test-Work \u2013 geochemical, metallurgical for completion in Q1 2022\n\nInterviewing FS and EPCM engineering firm candidates, with RFPs to be submitted\n\nContinued Social and Wyoming Government Outreach\n\nI will do the math. At today\u2019s gold price, the projected gold equivalent reserves at the CK project could be worth as much as $2.6 Billion. Not bad for a company whose market value is only $78M.\n\nEd Karr, the company CEO said, \"Considering the findings of the PFS study in the context of today's metal prices, we seem to be on the precipice of realizing exceptional value from a project whose time has come. We also are intrigued by the upside potential the CK Gold Project holds as we look at the potential value of the aggregate the project can produce at a time when development in the vicinity of the project is increasing.\"\n\nMake no mistake, this is a huge development that may result in a major catalyst for the company\u2019s value. I will have more to add to this report tomorrow.\n\n[Privacy policy and disclaimer](https://mailchi.mp/tradersnewssource/what-type-of-stocks-will-thrive-in-this-environment-650036?e=[UNIQID])",

        "selftext": "A New Metric to analyze and predict the future price of stocks is here, whether we like it or not. I am talking about quantified social media sentiments. The more I learn about the correlation of sentiments vs price, the more I see traditional stock signals as insufficient for determining the stock movement, and how insight into social sentiment is critical.\n\n**The core principle underlying technical analysis is that the market price reflects all available information that could impact a market**. But is this true now? I would argue that nowadays, the price of a particular stock also reflects the social media sentiments. For e.g., AMC and GME stocks broke all fundamentals and technicals that the analysts believed to be true and depicted the price what the market sentiments provided.\n\nOver the last year, we had significant growth in terms of retail investors both in stocks and crypto -- now adding up to over 30% of the investor market. Most of them, like myself, joined the market with very limited knowledge on analysis tools. Most of them look for trends on social media to make gains and cut losses. Why? Because it saves time. Following someone else\u2019s footsteps seems a comfortable signal that moves the price of the stock. So then why do the analysis tools still exclude these signals?\n\nAs a curious follower of the market trends, I would say that it is time to come up with a new playbook for stock market analysis. A playbook that breaks down the analysis into three main areas:\n\n1\\] Technical Analysis \n\n2\\] Fundamental Analysis \n\n3\\] Social Signals \n\nand then brings it together to provide insights on the stocks. \n\nCurrently, I have not seen many platforms offer all these services. But some platforms like public, daizy, swaggstocks and alphatrend have started to work around the community aspect of investing. Will the future of fintech products evolve to include social media sentiments as one of the analysis tools is something that we will have to wait and see. But for now, based on what I am reading, it sure seems like we are headed to a future where social media sentiments would be more of a need than a nice-to-know feature.",

Coinbase, Hood, Seatgeek, Acorns were some big public ones. some others are still private that I've actually heard of; Rally (NFT Marketplace), Dutchie, Postmates, Alt (Sports cards Marketplace)), Pieology, and the Recount.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**OUR FOCUS**\n\nThe below represent examples of our thematic areas of focus, by no means exclusively, many of which are experiencing accelerated digital transformation:\n\n\u2022**Sports**: We watch, consume and participate in sports largely in the same ways we have for decades, and all that has really changed is the screen size. Few sectors can match that claim. Generational change and technology have long knocked on the door of sports transformation and are now breaking through. Personalized streaming, augmented reality, e-sports, sports betting, biometric access, omnichannel events blurring in-home and live experiences, AI-powered analytical tools and block-chain applications are just a few examples of more bespoke approaches to engaging and retaining consumers that seek a differentiated experience. We believe this is an exciting moment for this massive global industry and one that will lend itself to incredible acquisition opportunities.\n\n\u2022**Health &amp; Wellness**: With the COVID-19 pandemic rapidly accelerating shifts towards telehealth in all categories, individuals have shown they want to be led by instructors, doctors, and subject matter experts on almost every choice they make, and they expect the same frictionless ease and connectivity they experience in other categories. Just as mobile devices and cloud computing technology have empowered on-demand transactions in sectors like video (Netflix), music (Spotify), transportation (Uber), sports betting (FanDuel, DraftKings), and insurance (Lemonade), mental health (Calm, Headspace), digital health (Peloton, Oura, Whoop- a Thirty Five and LionTree investment), and wellness (Noom) are the next industries to be completely digitized. The traditional healthcare vertical is poised for digital transformation as well, with growing levels of investment and maturation in the space, from the IPOs of Oscar Health (LionTree acted as co-manager and investor), GoodRx and Amwell, to the merger of Teladoc and Livongo, to the acquisition of hims &amp; hers by the Oaktree Acquisition Corp SPAC in a go-public transaction (LionTree advised hims &amp; hers management).8\n\n\u2022**Food Tech &amp; Supply**: Increased focus on personal health, animal welfare, and climate change have driven companies to harness technology to create more sustainable food products and production processes. Consumers want better options to achieve more sustainable consumption patterns, even if those alternatives are more expensive. Early pioneers such as Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods popularized plant-based meat substitutes. Companies like Seebo and Winnow have developed simple integration tools to help food manufacturers and restaurants control food waste along the manufacturing production line.\n\n\u2022**E-Commerce**: Tremendous energy and investment are devoted to how the intersection of retail, distribution and media might look in the future. Digital-first, direct-to-consumer platforms have flourished by focusing on a specific market segment, rethinking the consumer experience, and building community around their brand. Some examples include Warby Parker (eyewear), Harry\u2019s (personal care), Chewy (pets), Thrive Market (organic grocery), Wayfair (home decor), and Kaval and Rent The Runway (beauty/fashion/apparel) and Gucci (Luxury).\n\n\u2022**Crypto and Digital Assets**: The recent acceleration of crypto and digital assets as frictionless tools for the consumer continues to gain tremendous momentum with the rise of platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, Chainalysis, BlockChain.com and BlockFi or security solutions for crypto assets, such as hardware wallet technologies developed by Ledger. These technologies make the internet ownable, providing new ways to reward and compensate creators for their work allowing unbound creativity, and driving toward the emergence of potentially massive new platforms to harness this democratization of scarcity. We have witnessed heightened demand for the ability to \u2018purchase\u2019 or \u2018own\u2019 pieces of art (SuperRare), content collectibles (Dapper Labs), game collectibles (Axie Infinity), real estate (Decentraland) and much more \u2013 all of which is uniquely enabled by the blockchain. Consumers have been empowered to invest directly in athletes\u2019 performance (Sorare), artists (Beeple), and creators (Rally, Mirror), past or present. We believe these non-fungible tokens (NFTs) will enable greater liquidity for previously illiquid assets and reflect the nearly unimaginable scaling that the internet enables.",

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/smallstreetbets sub! Welcome to a new day, frrrrrrrresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, December 2nd, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Dow futures rise 100 points as travel stocks get boost following omicron sell-off](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/01/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n&gt; Dow futures rose in early trading Thursday despite the arrival of the latest Covid variant on U.S. shores and as the White House tightened travel restrictions.\n*****\n&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 120 points. S&amp;P 500 futures were flat and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.4%.\n*****\n&gt; The Biden administration reacted to the news that an omicron case had been reported in California by asking businesses to proceed with vaccination requirements, even though the administration\u2019s mandate was halted in courts pending review. The White House also tightened travel rules, requiring inbound passengers to be tested within 24 hours prior to departure.\n*****\n&gt; Airline, casino and energy stocks led the gainers in premarket trading.\n*****\n&gt; Dow component Boeing\u2019s shares jumped 3.6%, cruise line Royal Caribbean was up 3.6% while MGM Resorts International moved 2.7% higher, with Covid-sensitive companies benefitting amid early evidence showing the new strain may be less severe than earlier versions.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe remain cautious on S&amp;P 500 amid a hawkish Fed tightening into an overvalued market,\u201d said Savita Subramanian, Bank of America Securities head of U.S. equity &amp; quantitative strategy.\n*****\n&gt; Still, Bank of America noted that December has historically been the strongest month for the S&amp;P 500, with the average gaining 2.3% on average since 1936 and positive 79% of the time. However, December has not always been immune to sell-offs, Subramanian added.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAnother risk is an inflation-led consumption hit, especially as fiscal/monetary stimulus run out. Fed Chair Powell\u2019s comments on accelerated tapering and retiring the word \u2018transitory\u2019 indicate that the Fed\u2019s focus is now inflation rather than employment.\n*****\n&gt; During regular trading on Wednesday, stocks posted strong gains earlier in the session, but fell on news that the first omicron case had been reported in California. The Dow fell about 460 points, after the 30-stock benchmark had advanced 521 points. The S&amp;P dipped 1.18%, giving back an earlier gain of about 1.9%. The Nasdaq Composite slid 1.83%, after earlier trading 1.8% higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cInvestors are increasingly cautious about the Omicron variant as well as the likelihood of faster tapering,\u201d TD Securities said in a note to clients.\n*****\n&gt; Wednesday\u2019s whipsaw continues a highly volatile streak for stocks as the market digests what the new variant means.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this movie before and Wall Street will likely remain COVID-variant headline driven until a clear assessment over this wave can be made,\u201d said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. \u201cThe next couple of weeks will likely see risk appetite take a cue from incremental Omicron updates, supply chain issues, and every inflation reading,\u201d he added.\n*****\n&gt; On the data front, weekly initial jobless claims numbers will be released Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists are expecting a print of 240,000, according to estimates from Dow Jones. The prior reading showed 199,000 first-time filers, which was the lowest since November 1969. The November jobs report will be released on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Thursday\u2019s reading follows a better-than-expected ADP report on Wednesday. Private payrolls increased by 534,000 in November, ahead of the expected 506,000.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/lcmXJqv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/s3ioTNr.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/p6nFjhw.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Jml9Z5I.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/5KwRD2M.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($LI $CRM $CRWD $DOCU $SNOW $AI $DG $MRVL $ZS $ASAN $OKTA $ULTA $AMBA $NTAP $SIG $EXPR $HPE $BBW $BQ $BNS $JKS $FRO $MOMO $HIBB $SPLK $SWBI $QH $RY $CHS $BZUN $FIVE $BOX $VERU $YJ $KR $CTRN $TD $VEEV $BIG $GMS $DOOO $CM $EMKR $PVH)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/5ocvp67.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($DG $KR $EXPR $SIG $TD $VERU $GMS $DLTH $CM $LE $SCWX $EH $MEI)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/C4kn8oK.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XAPdoyp.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/P3xLOTx.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/G1tGjkp.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/8154yxP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/830rtCF.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5SsP6hb.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Vwv5b34.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/21JATCM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* AAPL\n* DWAC\n* BA\n* ABUS\n* AMC\n* ADA.X\n* CFVI\n* CMMB\n* AGC\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/02/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-snowflake-boeing-apple-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Snowflake** \u2014 The cloud data company\u2019s shares jumped more than 13% after the company reported quarterly results that beat revenue estimates.

        "selftext": "https://www.theancienteconomist.com/post/a-tale-of-two-americas-inflation-in-2008-compared-to-2021\n\nAs we all know, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said on Tuesday that inflation may keep rising as we head into 2022. Growing fears over this rise in the annual inflation rate are justifiable, as this number was at 4.4% in September 2021 and now is at 6.2% after October 2021. As a result, many investors and businessmen are nervous that we might be approaching a recession in the near future. We will attempt to look at various indicators and data from 2008, right before the Great Recession, to compare and contrast to the present day.\n\tFirst, how can we even define a recessionary period? Recessions generally arise from weakness in demand; however, issues with supply can also trigger economic dismay. Recessions come from a period of time where economic activity has become severely reduced, which can be statistically identified by falls in GDP in two consecutive quarters. Real GDP has increased by 6.7% in Q2 and 2.1% in Q3, indicating no worries of a recession at this moment (Bureau of Economic Analysis). However, there are some signs that we may be approaching this economic collapse very soon. \n\tWe should look to aggregate supply and demand to attempt to diagnose the future of the American economy. As we have seen in 2021, the economy has had no problem reacting to increases in aggregate demand: Congress just passed their $1.2 billion Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal, and consumers have more than enough money as a result of increased salaries, stimulus checks, and unemployment insurance. However, supply chain problems have sprung up as a result of almost too much demand, and companies have had a hard time keeping up. Nearly 40% of small businesses have supply chain delays as a result of the pandemic, and there has been a 14% increase in supply chain disruptions between 2019 and 2020 (Zippia). Clearly, there are issues with the aggregate supply that could worsen in the near future, with rising inflation allowing for a negative output gap between the availability of supply-side producers to deliver for demand-side consumers.",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 6th, 2021.\n\n# **More turbulence could be ahead for stocks as investors weigh omicron and the Fed\u2019s next steps - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/03/stocks-could-face-more-turbulence-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Volatility could continue to plague markets after a week of violent swings that sent many stocks plummeting.\n*****\n&gt; In the week ahead, investors await more news on the omicron Covid variant and another inflation report Friday that is expected to show consumer prices remain the hottest in three decades.\n*****\n&gt; In the past week, stocks sold off on worries about the omicron variant and concerns the Federal Reserve will move away from its easy policies and raise interest rates sooner than anticipated. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told a Congressional panel Tuesday that the central bank will consider speeding up the taper of its $120 billion monthly bond-buying program when it meets Dec. 14 and 15. The Federal Reserve put its bond-purchasing program in place in early 2020 to prop up the economy during the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a somewhat turbulent December because we probably need to wait for earnings season to get regrounded, back to fundamentals,\u201d said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset. \u201cFor as high as a lot of the ratios would suggest, price-to-sales, price-to-earnings, when you throw it into the hopper with interest rates and everything else, things aren\u2019t that bad. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re teetering on the edge of a cliff.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But Ablin did say the comments from Powell were unnerving investors, who fear the Fed will also speed up interest rate hikes. Powell acknowledged he was wrong about inflation being \u201ctransitory,\u201d or temporary, spooking investors. The bond purchases are now scheduled to end in June.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI\u2019m not sure what investors\u2019 read on inflation is. Do they think the Fed is going to raise rates, get ahead of it too early and everything is going to roll over? Ever since Powell took \u2018transitory\u2019 out of his talk, investors have been somewhat off balance,\u201d said Ablin.\n*****\n&gt; The consumer price index or CPI for November is expected Friday morning. Economists polled by Dow Jones predict it rose 0.6% on a monthly basis, or 6.7% year over year. That compares to a 0.9% gain in October, and a 6.2% jump year over year, the biggest move in three decades.\n*****\n&gt; # Risky names slammed\nHigh fliers and growth were among the hardest hit Friday, as investors bailed out of some of the riskiest stocks. As stocks plunged Friday, Treasury yields fell. Yields move opposite price, and the move was seen as a flight to safety. The 10-year note yield fell to 1.35%.\n*****\n&gt; The ARK Innovation ETF was down nearly 12.7% for the week. Most of the growth names in the fund plunged into bear market territory. \u201cI think investors have to keep in mind that\u2019s not a 15-week strategy. It\u2019s a 15-year strategy, as far as we\u2019re concerned,\u201d Ablin said.\n*****\n&gt; For the week, the small cap Russell 2000 was down nearly 4%, while the S&amp;P 500 was off just 1.2%. The worst performing major sector for the week was communications services, which includes internet companies. It was down 2.8%, followed by consumer discretionary, off 2.4%. Financials lost nearly 2%, and the S&amp;P technology sector was down 0.4% for the week. But on Friday, tech lost 1.7%.\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve should be quiet in the week ahead. Fed officials traditionally do not make major speeches in the blackout period, which is the coming week, ahead of their Dec. 14 and 15 meeting. One exception is Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari who speaks Thursday at the Center for Indian Country Development Research Summit.\n*****\n&gt; Much of the focus will be on how the market itself is performing.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cEver since the Nov. 22 outside bearish day, all strength has been sold with lots of damage underneath the hood,\u201d said Scott Redler of T3Live.com. \u201cNow finally some of the leadership names are showing faulty action.\u201d He noted that both Microsoft and Apple were weaker.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMoney is not hiding in Amazon, Google, or Facebook. They haven\u2019t been special for weeks,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P closed below its 50-day moving average Friday, after closing below it Wednesday. The 50-day is at 4,544. That\u2019s a signal to some market technicians that the index is on the verge of breaking down. The 50-day moving average is the average closing price over the past 50 days, and is viewed as a momentum indicator.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBasically, it\u2019s effectively a retest of support because we had the relief rally [Thursday],\u201d said Katie Stockton, founder of Fairlead Strategies. She said the S&amp;P 500 needs to close below the 50-day for two consecutive days before the move is considered a breakdown.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe action in the high growth, high multiple names is not a good sign,\u201d said Stockton. \u201cWe do have some signs of downside exhaustion but not as widespread as I would hope. We\u2019re seeing some of the heavyweights, like Adobe for example, taking out levels like the 50-day moving averages.\u201d She said some of those big names have now joined the selling.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re just watching how bad it gets. Monday is going to be the tell,\u201d said Stockton. \u201cThat also gives it the weekend to settle... Extremes have gotten a little bit more extreme. Sentiment is the most oversold from a contrarian perspective since the October low.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/hk2QMMD.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/w6utI7X.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/N8u66xV.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/tagANgL.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/28oKFM3.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/t8zd2PY.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fEvF2Bm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ponrnUL.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SqxThz0.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ARPnz4g.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/3QmNJUa.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/sz567v5.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/s9GIfxy.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/zBWalJo.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/Cz7EeMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small-Cap Corrections\n\n&gt; At the close on Wednesday (12/1), the small-cap Russell 2,000 had fallen 12.1% from its recent high on November 8th, leaving the index in \"correction\" territory. A market \"correction\" is a drop of 10%+ that was preceded by a rally of at least 10% on a closing basis. This correction for the Russell 2,000 is its 58th since data for the index begins in 1978. Below is a table showing prior corrections for the Russell. The average correction sees the index fall 18.35%, which is just shy of the 20% threshold for a \"bear market.\" The median correction is a little smaller at -15.4%. In terms of length, the average Russell correction has lasted 73 days, while the median is 62 days. For the current Russell 2,000 correction to reach average levels, it would need to fall another 7% from here, and it would come to an end on January 20th, 2022.\n\n&gt; In terms of extremes, the biggest correction that the Russell 2,000 has ever experienced was the 41.9% decline seen during the initial COVID Crash from 1/16/20 to 3/18/20. The longest correction lasted 397 days from 6/24/83 to 7/25/84. In terms of the shortest correction, there were two that lasted 3 days. One of those came during the Financial Crisis while the other happened last June.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/raycorrec.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # December Typically Starts Out Weak\n\n&gt; December typically starts out weak as tax-loss selling ramps up and with the big gains this year we would expect that early December weakness to materialize. Then as you can see in the typical December chart here stocks begin to takeoff around mid-month led by small caps and the Russell 2000.\n\n&gt; This is what used to be known as the \u201cJanuary Effect:\u201d small caps outperforming large caps in the month of January. Nowadays most of the so-called January Effect takes place in the last half of December (2021 Almanac pages 110 &amp; 112, 2022 pages 112 &amp; 114). The January Effect is not to be confused with the January Barometer (2021 Almanac page 16, 2022 page 18), which states as the S&amp;P 500 goes in January, so goes the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/84caf5990b652671445781962a51ee2f/b2ebb400780bd4c8-af/s500x750/1795f2bbf763fb254a002bda32bd9b217881240b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # December Almanac: Small Cap Effect &amp; Santa Claus Rally\n\n&gt; Trading in December is holiday inspired and fueled by a buying bias throughout the month. However, the first part of the month tends to be weaker as tax-loss selling and yearend portfolio restructuring begins. Regardless, December is laden with market seasonality and important events.\n\n&gt; December is the number three S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials month since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% on each index. It\u2019s the second-best Russell 2000 (1979) month and third best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000 (1979). In 2018, DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of 2018 is not all that likely. When December is down it is usually a turning point in the market\u2014near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half of the month.\n\n&gt; In the last seventeen post-election years, December\u2019s ranking slip to #7 S&amp;P 500, #7 NASDAQ and DJIA #5. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, tend to have a field day in post-election-year Decembers. Since 1981, the Russell 2000 has lost ground three time in ten post-election years in December. The average small cap gain in all ten years is a solid 2.2%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/64044be6e473181304fe66b98074cbde/5618185eea1cfe29-fe/s400x600/931f46ef694541cebb05ea5f3193a5faa1f6bc60.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Small caps tend to start to outperform larger caps near the middle of the month (early January Effect) and The \u201cSanta Claus Rally\u201d begins on the open on December 27 and lasts until the second trading day of 2022. Average S&amp;P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%.\n\n&gt; Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down. The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch\u2019s now famous line states, \u201cIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 6 Things To Know About December And Omicron\n\n&gt; Here comes December, historically a pretty solid month for stocks, but now we have the Omicron variant wreaking havoc on markets. \u201cWhat a difference a week makes. A week ago stocks were at all-time highs and the economy was strong. Now all we have are uncertainties and questions,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAs of now we\u2019re optimistic that stocks will sidestep the new variant worries, but we recommend investors buckle up their seatbelts, as the end of 2021 could be a bumpy one.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here are six things to think about as we head into the jolliest month of them all.\n\n&gt; First, historically, the S&amp;P 500 Index has gained 1.5% on average in December, which is the third best month of the year with only April and November better. But as you can see here, over the past 10 years, December has been much weaker. Of course, much of this was due to a huge 9.2% drop in 2018 (which we\u2019ll get to soon enough).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-pic-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Second, some more good news is December has been up 74.3% of the time, more than any other month of the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-2-.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; drop in 2018. Only once in history was December the worst month of the year for the S&amp;P 500 and it was indeed in 2018. Three times it was the second worst month of the year, in 1968, 1980, and 1996. The worst monthly return so far this year was a 4.8% drop in September.\n\n&gt; Fourth, stocks usually don\u2019t get moving until the second half of the month, right as the holiday good feel vibes start to come out.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-pic-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Fifth, this year is in rare air, as all 11 months have made a new all-time high so far. Should the S&amp;P 500 make new highs in December that would be a perfect 12 for 12, matching 2014 as the only years to complete this incredible feat.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-post-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Sixth, as we show in the LPL Chart of the Day, it turns out that when stocks are up more than 20% for the year heading into December (like 2021), the final month actually does better, up 1.7% versus 1.5%. Also, it has been higher eight of the past nine times the year was up more than 20% heading into the final month.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-post-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Job Growth Came Up Short in November\n\n&gt; The domestic economy added just 210,000 jobs during November, well below Bloomberg-surveyed economists\u2019 consensus forecast for a gain of 550,000 and below October\u2019s revised tally of 546,000. The net revision to prior months was positive but only by 82,000.\n\n&gt; The modest 23,000 gain in leisure and hospitality jobs, which were up 170,000 in October, and a 20,000 drop in retail jobs don\u2019t make much sense given solid retail sales data of late. That could set up a positive reversal from revisions next month, though that potential bump will play some tug-of-war with the emergence of the Omicron COVID-19 variant, which came after the November survey period ended.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, for the past four months the pace of job gains has been well below the pre-Delta variant levels of near 1 million back in June and July. However, there are a number of reasons to be optimistic that job growth picks up in early 2022, assuming the Omicron variant doesn\u2019t get in the way.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe job growth number is disappointing, no doubt, especially considering the survey period fell before we even know the name of the newest Covid-19 variant,\u201d noted LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. \u201cWhile Omicron may curb hiring a bit over the next month or two, we remain confident in our expectation for strong job gains and above-average growth in the U.S. economy in 2022.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-pic-12.3.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The story was clearly better when looking at the unemployment rate, derived from the household survey rather than from employers. The unemployment rate unexpectedly fell from 4.6% to 4.2% in November as workers\u2014in an encouraging sign\u2014came off the sidelines (1.14 million of them), lifting the participation rate by 0.2% to 61.8%, a post-recession high but still well off pre-pandemic levels.\n\n&gt; Inflation data also painted a somewhat reassuring picture. The year-over-year increase in average hourly earnings rose less than expected at 4.8% (+0.3% month over month), below consensus expectations of 5.0% and 0.4%, and not enough to keep up with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) over the same period. It\u2019s reasonable to conclude that the increase in labor participation helped limit wage increases, but we have a long way to go there still. The labor market is still 3.9 million jobs below pre-pandemic levels and the labor market remains under-supplied, as noted above. In other words, further improvement in participation will still be needed to help contain inflation pressure.\n\n&gt; Some will argue that this report will make the Federal Reserve (Fed) think twice before accelerating tapering of its bond purchases, but we\u2019re not so sure.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere were a number of positives with this jobs report,\u201d explained LPL Financial Fixed Income Strategist Lawrence Gillum. \u201cLabor force participation increased and the unemployment rate fell\u2014both of which point to a continued strong jobs market. That may give the Fed reasons to speed up its tapering plans.\u201d\n\n&gt; Overall, this report is a disappointing reminder that we\u2019re going to have to wait longer for the booming jobs numbers that we still expect to see. We continue to expect more people to get back to work in the months ahead, in an environment of strong labor demand, which can help alleviate wage pressure and firm up the economic growth outlook. Omicron is a risk but based on the information we have today, we do not expect that variant, or any others, to meaningfully slow the job market recovery in 2022.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending December 3rd, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.5.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * (**$CHPT $GME $LULU $CHWY $COST $AZO $RH $SAIC $LOVE $AVGO $DLHC $PATH $COUP $MDB $ASO $DBI $THO $ORCL $PLAY $CBP $SFIX $HRL $S $CONN $SUMO $SOL $UNFI $KFY $GTLB $CIEN $ALCO $PD $TOL $HQY $CASY $CNM $VRA $GEF $JW.A $ALOT $PLAB $AOUT**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ARPnz4g.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/V8bYDe5.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.6.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/br3K0zL.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.6.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hbGoBFe.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  12.7.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tM8wghC.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 12.7.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hhcFlGr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.8.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/lPByiPr.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.8.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FNjpxcY.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.9.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2PUPQhA.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.9.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/6kqQxly.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.10.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/OcHR8nI.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.10.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ChargePoint Holdings, Inc. $21.57\n&gt; **ChargePoint Holdings, Inc.

        "selftext": "I understand the wash sale 30 day rule, but my question is about cost basis and losses when buying back just a part of the total I sold within 30 days.\n\nSo I sold SQ and ROKU at a loss, and now 2-3 weeks later they\u2019ve cratered even further.\n\nNow, I could wait 1-2 more weeks and be free and clear, but I don\u2019t have a crystal ball, and I like them at these prices and don\u2019t want to miss out.\n\nSo say for simplicity I had 20 shares of each, and I want to buy back 10 of them.\n\nFor full context, the 20 shares also had different tax lots.  I typically buy 5 at a time.\n\nSo if I buy back 5 or 10 of them, how is cost basis handled with wash sale?\n\nDoes the total loss from all 20 shares sold apply to the 10 shares I bought back, or just the loss from the same number of shares (10) that I buy back?  In other words, would I get to realize half the losses or none of the losses?\n\nIf it\u2019s just the 10 shares, which cost basis loss applies?  The highest tax lot or the lowest?\n\nExample:\n\nBuy 5 shares at $250\nBuy 5 shares at $225\nBuy 10 shares at $220\n\nSell all 20 at $200\n\nBuy 10 back within 30 days for $175\n\nDoes the cumulative loss of all 20 shares get applied to the 10 I bought back and I get no tax credit on the realized loss of the 10 I didn\u2019t buy back?\n\nOr if I can take a partial loss, which tax lot gets applied to the 10?  Obviously I would want the 10 shares I bought at $220 and sold for $200 to be my buy back cost basis, and realize the loss of the 5 I sold at $250 and $225.\n\nSorry for the wordy post, just wanna be clear on my question.\n\nThanks!",

        "selftext": " \n\nGGPI is a hidden Gem that will explode soon let me tell you why\n\nFundamentally lets look at polestar competitor: Rivian is valued at over 100 and lucid over 40 yet Polestar sold more then both combined. yet we are priced at 11$. polestar has also hit its target number in production 2021 and has ambitious goals in 2022 in expanding in the usa and asia, their vehicle are priced between 45k to 145k so i ask is ggpi really worth 11$?. this could easily become min $40-$70 company once merger is complete which we expect in q1\n\nLets look at the option chain because they are looking juicy\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3eaaqpjkek381.png?width=1584&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce302129d6a57cb2a1b7e8b02a8cce09baba9929\n\nCall\n\nGGPI float is quite low 80M for an ev (lucid, nio, tsla, over 1B float, Rivian 500M) currently and if we look at DEC and JAN call option they are looking nuclear especially Jan over 52k will be in the money at 10 $ as well as 24k in dec\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/va3mlbelek381.png?width=1572&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b328d0ea50a483a2aad6c6e605e6954756f247e6\n\nd\n\nnow check out the call volume for dec and jan !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Folks are loading up. especially during a bear market this is HUGEE.\n\nAnother catalyst i look for is jim cramer: jim says sell i say BUY!!!!\n\n\u201cNo. I looked at this. We were talking about it with the investment club people. We got together and said, OK, just one more, one more, one more. I\u2019m not there. I\u2019m not backing this group. Just can\u2019t.\u201d - Jim Cramer\n\nNow lets talk about the bearish thesis\n\n* china cracking down on Chinese stock in the us market as polestar has links to china\n* its a spac merger still hasn't gone through yet so your investing in hopes that the merger gets approved and goes through\n* SEC investigation\n\nmy thought on these 3 bearish thesis\n\n* polestar isn't a Chinese company its based in Switzerland but has financial ties to china\n* Gores Guggenheim has a stellar website and has done this before. When polestar CEO was interviewed Dec 2nd he sounded very confident in GG merger\n* SEC investigation happens to majority of spec word is it has something to do with the price being to low or the 6% stake gg will receive after merger\n\nDid I miss anything?\n\nWhat are your thoughts ?",

        "selftext": "I own Microsoft. I\u2019m not selling it, but I looked at the past 20 years for Microsoft and up until 5 years ago, the price never cracked into the 60s. 2016 you could buy the stock for 50 bucks a share. And the price had stated between 20-50 dollars for the better part of 20 years. Now it\u2019s 323?? If you look at the 20 years graph it really is pretty damn parabolic. \n\nI know everyone is dooming about a market crash or correction, but I honestly think the Covid news will dissipate. We will see 10% loses and people will get in quick and hit new all time highs. That\u2019s just my guess, and I\u2019m a long term investor so I don\u2019t care too much about what happens in the day to day or even month to month. \n\nWhat I do care about though is whether I should dump a ton of money into Microsoft now, or just a little bit anticipating a correction. Because it\u2019s parabolic, I don\u2019t feel confident it would continue, but who knows. \n\nWhat do you guys think? \n\nNote: I love Microsoft and it\u2019ll be worth a hell of a lot more in 10 years than it will be today, even if we are super inflated.",

In view of the fact that all metropolitan areas in Taiwan have been deployed.

From now until December 31, \"Gogoro Super Sale\" will be combined with government subsidies and revitalization to purchase Gogoro. Electric locomotives plus extra battery charge discounts, the project can be discounted up to 35,600 yuan.

You have this week to redeem your units. I recommend you do so.\u00a0\n\nThe share price of CFV is a shade under $10. It has been remarkably stable. Many of the owners of CFFVU are institutional and accredited investors who invested to make a small return on their money and get the warrants for free. The units are barely above $10, which tells me there is a lot of risk of a dive upon redemption. I don't want to take that risk.\u00a0\n\nI believe since this stock has not run higher on the Satellogic deal, that if you have the units, then you should go to your brokerage and redeem them. You will receive about $10 per share, but also 1/3 of a warrant for every unit. Do this now, the deadline is coming!\u00a0\n\nIf you own CFV shares, you are about even, maybe a few cents up. Sell the shares. Do this now!\n\nWhen the redemptions occur, this is going to look a lot like Spire Global I think. Not for sure, but it is set up that way. Even if it doesn't dip to $8ish or lower, I think there will be enough volatility to buy the shares later as we see how things develop. I do like all of these satellite as a service companies long-term, but why take another bruising?\u00a0\n\n...just my opinion, do your own research and consider your own risk tolerance and goals",

Planet will trade as PL.\u00a0\n\nOnce the units split, you'll get a share of PL and 1/5 warrant of PL, so every 5 units get you 1 share of PL.\n\nIf you own DMYQ shares, those will just convert to PL.\u00a0\n\nThe Google connection and all the other contracts really give Planet a leg up in this space and I have been calling them best of the bunch for a while now.\u00a0They have a lead on the other satellite-as-a-service companies so want this one from go. I will accumulate others such as BSKY, SPIR and SATL on the dips, already have starters in BKSY and SPIR.\n\nI am not only holding onto my DMYQU, I am rounding up the position to 4% buying more under $11 while I can. This will put me at a 5% exposure to Planet in a few weeks. I am ok with that. I can manage it from there and think the options market is going to support significant opportunities.\u00a0",

        "selftext": "&gt;Former President Donald Trump's new social media venture is seeking to raise up to $1 billion by selling shares to hedge funds and family offices at several times the valuation it commanded in a deal with a blank-check acquisition firm in October, two people familiar with the matter said.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Trump Media &amp; Technology Group, which has yet to roll out the social media app it says it is developing, already stands to receive $293 million if its deal to list in New York through a merger with blank-check firm Digital World Acquisition Corp is completed.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The deal valued Trump Media at $875 million, including debt. Trump Media is now seeking to raise up to an additional $1 billion at a valuation of close to $3 billion, to reflect Digital World's share rally after Trump supporters and day traders snapped up the stock, the sources said.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It is the clearest indication yet that Trump and the Digital World dealmakers are seeking to capitalize on the market euphoria around their venture, which has so far been fueled by its ambitious goals rather than a business that is up and running.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Digital World shares were valued at $10 each in the deal with Trump Media. Trump Media is now looking to secure a so-called private investment in public equity (PIPE) that would value Digital World shares closer to their recent price, the sources said.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Digital World shares, which were trading down 6% before news of the $1 billion raise, rallied to close up 7% at $44.35 on Wednesday.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The move represents a departure from most PIPE deals, which are typically done at $10 per share, and would result in a much greater dilution of existing Digital World investors.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The sources added that Digital World shares may be valued based on a 20% discount of their 10-day, volume-weighted average price.\n\nContinues at [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-trumps-social-media-venture-205522192.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-trumps-social-media-venture-205522192.html)",

        "selftext": "McKinsey Insights[Original Article](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/telehealth-a-quarter-trillion-dollar-post-covid-19-reality)\n\nStrong continued uptake, favorable consumer perception, and tangible investment into this space are all contributing to the continued growth of telehealth in 2021. New analysis indicates telehealth use has increased 38X from the pre-COVID-19 baseline.\n\nEarly in the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth usage surged as consumers and providers sought ways to safely access and deliver healthcare. In April 2020, overall telehealth utilization for office visits and outpatient care was 78 times higher than in February 2020. \n\nThis step-change, borne out of necessity, was enabled by these factors: 1) increased consumer willingness to use telehealth, 2) increased provider willingness to use telehealth, 3) regulatory changes enabling greater access and reimbursement. During the tragedy of the pandemic, telehealth offered a bridge to care, and now offers a chance to reinvent virtual and hybrid virtual/in-person care models, with a goal of improved healthcare access, outcomes, and affordability.\nA year ago, we estimated that up to\u00a0$250 billion of US healthcare spend could potentially be shifted to virtual or virtually enabled care. Approaching this potential level of virtual health is not a foregone conclusion. It would likely require sustained consumer and clinician adoption and accelerated redesign of care pathways to incorporate virtual modalities.\nAs of July 2021, we step back to review the progress of telehealth since the initial COVID-19 spike and to assess implications for telehealth and virtual health1\u00a0more broadly going forward. Our findings include the following insights:\n\nTelehealth utilization has stabilized at levels 38X higher than before the pandemic.\u00a0After an initial spike to more than 32 percent of office and outpatient visits occurring via telehealth in April 2020, utilization levels have largely stabilized, ranging from 13 to 17 percent across all specialties.2\u00a0This utilization reflects more than two-thirds of what we anticipated as visits that could be virtualized.3\n\nSimilarly, consumer and provider attitudes toward telehealth have improved since the pre-COVID-19 era.\u00a0Perceptions and usage have dropped slightly since the peak in spring 2020. Some barriers\u2014such as perceptions of technology security\u2014remain to be addressed to sustain consumer and provider virtual health adoption, and models are likely to evolve to optimize hybrid virtual and in-person care delivery.\n\nSome regulatory changes that facilitated expanded use of telehealth have been made permanent,\u00a0for example, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services\u2019 expansion of reimbursable telehealth codes for the 2021 physician fee schedule. But uncertainty still exists as to the fate of other services that may lose their waiver status when the public health emergency ends.\n\nInvestment in virtual care and digital health more broadly has skyrocketed,\u00a0fueling further innovation, with 3X the level of venture capitalist digital health investment in 2020 than it had in 2017.4\n\nVirtual healthcare models and business models are evolving and proliferating,\u00a0moving from purely \u201cvirtual urgent care\u201d to a range of services enabling longitudinal virtual care, integration of telehealth with other virtual health solutions, and hybrid virtual/in-person care models, with the potential to improve consumer experience/convenience, access, outcomes, and affordability.",

        "selftext": "Ethereum is disrupting all of traditional finance via the platforms and applications running on top of its blockchain.  When Ethereum 2.0 is fully implemented, the big banks have much to fear in the long run. Proof-of-stake will make Ethereum's blockchain dramatically more energy efficient, more secure, and the shards upgrade will allow for a 1000x throughput upgrade to over 100,000 transactions per second, from the current 15-45.  The cost to transact on Ethereum will finally decrease to mere pennies.  When this occurs, the big banks have much to fear.\n\nBanks have had a monopoly on giving people or corporations loans since their inception.  Because of this, they\u2019ve been able to provide people with relatively predatory loan rates, and have restricted movement of many up the wealth curve.  Banks, like all institutions, have certain incentives to push and must also abide by laws and regulations of governments.  This limits their potential clientele, leaving an opportunity for someone else\u2026\n\nEnter DeFi where with just an internet connection and some crypto, you can get a loan to fund any idea you may have.  No credit scores, no income, just your capital and your idea.  While obviously there are risks to this, the upside outweighs the risks in my view.  A farmer in Africa can now raise capital to expand his business from someone in Germany.  All political or systematic red tape preventing anyone from raising capital has been removed.  If you have the collateral to provide for a loan, you\u2019re eligible.\n\nThis is the power of Ethereum and the DeFi ecosystem.  Technology and code is disrupting the entire legacy finance stack.  Anyone in the world can now get funded, all without any middleman taking a cut for themselves.  I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see ETH become a multi-trillion dollar asset in the coming years, assuming the Ethereum2.0 upgrade is completed by the end of 2022. While ETH has changed the world already, it\u2019s just getting started.  A fast, cheap Ethereum blockchain will change everything, again.  If you want to learn more, have a listen to my latest podcast on ETH 2.0.  What they\u2019re doing, how they\u2019re doing it, and it\u2019s impact is all detailed. \n\nListen by searching for Beyond Money on all major podcast platforms for those of you that are interested.

Coinbase, Hood, Seatgeek, Acorns were some big public ones. some others are still private that I've actually heard of; Rally (NFT Marketplace), Dutchie, Postmates, Alt (Sports cards Marketplace)), Pieology, and the Recount.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**OUR FOCUS**\n\nThe below represent examples of our thematic areas of focus, by no means exclusively, many of which are experiencing accelerated digital transformation:\n\n\u2022**Sports**: We watch, consume and participate in sports largely in the same ways we have for decades, and all that has really changed is the screen size. Few sectors can match that claim. Generational change and technology have long knocked on the door of sports transformation and are now breaking through. Personalized streaming, augmented reality, e-sports, sports betting, biometric access, omnichannel events blurring in-home and live experiences, AI-powered analytical tools and block-chain applications are just a few examples of more bespoke approaches to engaging and retaining consumers that seek a differentiated experience. We believe this is an exciting moment for this massive global industry and one that will lend itself to incredible acquisition opportunities.\n\n\u2022**Health &amp; Wellness**: With the COVID-19 pandemic rapidly accelerating shifts towards telehealth in all categories, individuals have shown they want to be led by instructors, doctors, and subject matter experts on almost every choice they make, and they expect the same frictionless ease and connectivity they experience in other categories. Just as mobile devices and cloud computing technology have empowered on-demand transactions in sectors like video (Netflix), music (Spotify), transportation (Uber), sports betting (FanDuel, DraftKings), and insurance (Lemonade), mental health (Calm, Headspace), digital health (Peloton, Oura, Whoop- a Thirty Five and LionTree investment), and wellness (Noom) are the next industries to be completely digitized. The traditional healthcare vertical is poised for digital transformation as well, with growing levels of investment and maturation in the space, from the IPOs of Oscar Health (LionTree acted as co-manager and investor), GoodRx and Amwell, to the merger of Teladoc and Livongo, to the acquisition of hims &amp; hers by the Oaktree Acquisition Corp SPAC in a go-public transaction (LionTree advised hims &amp; hers management).8\n\n\u2022**Food Tech &amp; Supply**: Increased focus on personal health, animal welfare, and climate change have driven companies to harness technology to create more sustainable food products and production processes. Consumers want better options to achieve more sustainable consumption patterns, even if those alternatives are more expensive. Early pioneers such as Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods popularized plant-based meat substitutes. Companies like Seebo and Winnow have developed simple integration tools to help food manufacturers and restaurants control food waste along the manufacturing production line.\n\n\u2022**E-Commerce**: Tremendous energy and investment are devoted to how the intersection of retail, distribution and media might look in the future. Digital-first, direct-to-consumer platforms have flourished by focusing on a specific market segment, rethinking the consumer experience, and building community around their brand. Some examples include Warby Parker (eyewear), Harry\u2019s (personal care), Chewy (pets), Thrive Market (organic grocery), Wayfair (home decor), and Kaval and Rent The Runway (beauty/fashion/apparel) and Gucci (Luxury).\n\n\u2022**Crypto and Digital Assets**: The recent acceleration of crypto and digital assets as frictionless tools for the consumer continues to gain tremendous momentum with the rise of platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, Chainalysis, BlockChain.com and BlockFi or security solutions for crypto assets, such as hardware wallet technologies developed by Ledger. These technologies make the internet ownable, providing new ways to reward and compensate creators for their work allowing unbound creativity, and driving toward the emergence of potentially massive new platforms to harness this democratization of scarcity. We have witnessed heightened demand for the ability to \u2018purchase\u2019 or \u2018own\u2019 pieces of art (SuperRare), content collectibles (Dapper Labs), game collectibles (Axie Infinity), real estate (Decentraland) and much more \u2013 all of which is uniquely enabled by the blockchain. Consumers have been empowered to invest directly in athletes\u2019 performance (Sorare), artists (Beeple), and creators (Rally, Mirror), past or present. We believe these non-fungible tokens (NFTs) will enable greater liquidity for previously illiquid assets and reflect the nearly unimaginable scaling that the internet enables.",

        "selftext": "What separates the legendary, multi-bagger de-SPAC redemption squeezes from those (like ENFA or LOCL) that fizzle out almost as soon as they begin?\n\nIn my opinion, there are a few factors at play. First, the big squeezes almost always seem to happen in SPACs that were small with few outstanding shares (typically, a trust size of under $200 million, meaning less than 20 million shares, seems to be necessary). $AGIL, $EFTR, $HLBZ, and $IRNT all had sub-$200m trusts to begin with. SPACs with the typical trust size of $300 or $345 million do not seem to squeeze very often, even if redemptions are 90%+ ($ARQQ is an exception).\n\nAnother factor at play is the company that is actually underneath the merger itself. I believe that one of the reasons for the quick failure of the ENFA and LOCL squeeze attempts is the fact that *everybody* knows the merged companies are crap. Nobody wants to be the sucker left bagholding shares of Buzzfeed or some indoor farming or underwater mining startup with no revenue. So, when the price stops going up, people run for the exits, sell, and, just like that, the price plummets and the \"squeeze\" is over.\n\nA squeeze works much better if there is some legitimate bullish sentiment on the underlying company. Which brings me to my main point. Allow me to introduce Hagerty ($HGTY fka $ADF):\n\n**What is Hagerty?**\n\nHagerty is a company offering insurance to owners of classic cars. Now, don't get too afraid of the word \"insurance\". Hagerty is an established company, not some $LMND/$MILE \"insurtech\" junk. They have a strong relationship with hundreds of thousands of classic car enthusiasts and $500 million in annual revenue. \n\nClassic car insurance has much higher margins than most other types of insurance because classic cars spend most of their time in storage rather than on the road, so there are fewer losses. Hagerty, unlike most IPO and SPAC companies, is *already* profitable. And with a reduction in operating expenses relative to revenue, they have the potential to be much more profitable.\n\n**So if Hagerty is a quality, profitable company, why are they going public through a SPAC? And why are there so many redemptions?**\n\nThe Hagerty SPAC deal has some very unusual qualities and it is these qualities that make it the ideal candidate for a MEGA redemption squeeze.\n\nIt is best to understand that this is not really a SPAC deal. It is a PIPE deal where the SPAC is essentially just a sideshow. Hagerty is receiving a massive $704 million PIPE which will go both to the company itself and toward cashing out some of the current owners. The PIPE investors in this case are essentially making a large private equity investment in Hagerty but want to take the company public simultaneously. They have chosen to partner with a small SPAC, $ADF, in order to get this done in a quick and easy manner.\n\n$ADF, now $HGTY, was a tiny SPAC with only $116.5 million in trust and 11.5 million outstanding shares. Although I do not know this for sure, I suspect the number of outstanding shares is now much, much lower. Allow me to explain why:\n\nThe Hagerty DA was announced on August 18, right near the absolute rock bottom of one of the SPAC market's recurring nadirs. In the time since, it has received almost zero retail attention. There is no Stocktwits page and there are scant few mentions here on Reddit. What about institutional investors? The sponsor had little need to market the shares to institutions because the massive PIPE easily covers the necessary cash. The sponsor gets their founder shares no matter what. Thus, I believe it is likely that the overwhelming number of the already small number of $ADF shares were held by arb funds at the time of merger. 80-90% redemptions or even higher would not surprise me.\n\n$ADF's trading history corroborates my thesis. Virtually all of the time between the IPO and the merger, shares stayed below the $10.10 NAV. The few times they did get above that level, the volume was microscopic. There is no evidence of any significant retail or non-arb institutional purchases.\n\nAldel and Hagerty have not released information about redemptions, so there is a possibility I could be wrong. Redemptions could theoretically be lower than I think. But, if that is the case, how does one explain today's trading behavior?\n\n**$HGTY is already up more than 50%**\n\nDespite the massacre that took place across equity markets today, $HGTY closed at $15.40, up more than 50% from its NAV and more than 40% just today. This afternoon, it was halted during a spike on hardly any volume. After the halt, the price surged to more than $19 before settling back down a bit. But remember, all of this occurred on a deeply red day and it was *not* caused by retail buying. Total volume today was low and, despite the surge in price, there has been basically no attention on any retail trading forum. Now if $HGTY can go up more than 40% on a red day with very little volume, imagine what it can do on a regular day and with some actual attention... Do you feel the excitement yet? \n\nDisclaimer: I am long $HGTY shares. My average cost basis is around $13.\n\nI am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice.",

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, December 3, 2021**\n\nStocks sank today to end the week lower, with technology and growth stocks cratering as market participants digested further updates regarding the Omicron variant and recent marks made by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, alongside the Labor Department\u2019s November jobs report. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed the week -1.2% lower, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) slid -2.6% and the Dow Jones (DIA) fell -1.83%. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, closed the week a whopping -5.24% lower. \n\n**Notable Numbers Today**\n\n* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): -0.87%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): -1.74%\n* Dow Jones (DIA): -0.11%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): -2.05%\n* VIX: +8.71%\n* NVIDIA: -4.46%\n* Tesla (TSLA): -6.42%\n* DocuSign (DOCU): -42.22%\n* Asana (ASAN): -26.40%\n* Marvell Tech (MRVL): +17.70%\n\nDevelopment surrounding the new Omicron variant remains front and center of the market\u2019s attention. So far, at least five US states have reported at least one case of the variant and over three dozen countries globally. A new report by the World Health Organization (WHO) has so far seen \u201ca suggestion that there is increased transmissibility\u201d of the Omicron variant. However, the report notes that it is still too soon and not enough data is available to make any conclusions yet. \n\nVaccine makers released new, less optimistic commentary regarding how effective existing vaccines are against the new Omicron variant. Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said their current vaccine would likely see a \u201cmaterial drop\u201d in effectiveness against the Omicron variant. \n\nHe said, \u201cThere is no world, I think, where \\[the effectiveness\\] is the same level\u2009we had with \\[the\\] Delta \\[variant\\]. I think it\u2019s going to be a material drop. I just don\u2019t know how much because we need to wait for the data. But all the scientists I\u2019ve talked to\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. are like, \u2018This is not going to be good\u2019.\u201d\n\n[https://www.ft.com/content/27def1b9-b9c8-47a5-8e06-72e432e0838f](https://www.ft.com/content/27def1b9-b9c8-47a5-8e06-72e432e0838f)\n\nMoreover, the market move today coincides with the release of the Labor Department\u2019s November job report, which showed a disappointing hiring rate even as the unemployment rate fell to a fresh pandemic-era low. Here are the numbers\n\n* Payroll Gains: +210,000 vs +550,000 expected\n* Unemployment Rate: 4.2% vs 4.6% in October\n\nJim Smiegiel, Chief Investment Officer at SEI Investments, said \u201cThe markets ... have been pricing in, really, a worst-case scenario. I think the market is now switching gears a little bit and perhaps lessening the intensity of the potential for negative outcomes. The big issue still remains more about the world government's reaction to the variant and what that means from a lockdown perspective. And that's what the market is still kind of struggling with at this stage.\" \n\nJ. Pow\u2019s latest remarks before the Senate Banking Committee further spooked the markets, after he said he would back off from using the word \u201ctransitory\u201d to describe rising inflation. This is very notable because the Central bank has been using the T-word since the beginning of the year, when it warned that steep differences in year-over-year comparisons and supply-chain bottlenecks would lead to elevated inflation. \n\nPowell said, \u201c\u201cWe tend to use \\[the word transitory\\] to mean that it won\u2019t leave a permanent mark in the form of higher inflation. I think it\u2019s probably a good time to retire that word and try to explain more clearly what we mean.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Powell suggested the Central Bank was considering completing its asset purchase taper \u201ca few months sooner\u201d than previously telegraphed. Market participants expected a more supportive stance, especially with the new COVID variant, but instead Powell suggested his priority was now on curbing higher than expected inflation. \n\nCharlie Ripley, senior investment strategist at Allianz Investment, said \u201cChairman Powell\u2019s commentary course-corrected the view on inflation and the potential need for quicker policy adjustment. The reality is hotter inflation coupled with a strong economic backdrop could end the Fed\u2019s bond buying program as early as the first quarter of next year. Ultimately, the transitory view on inflation has officially come to an end as Powell\u2019s comments reinforced the notion that elevated prices are likely to persist well into next year. With potential changes in policy on the horizon, market participants should expect additional market volatility in this uncharted territory.\" \n\nOn a personal note, I am taking this opportunity to do some very small dip buying (no more than \u00bc position). As usual I believe the market is overreacting (as it tends to do). While it is important to acknowledge the risks present in the market, and be prepared to act if they arise, I personally believe Omicron fears are overblown (I remember we had the same song and dance when Delta was first discovered). More concerning is the Fed\u2019s change in attitude towards inflation. That said, the only thing discussed so far has been accelerating the timeline for tapering asset purchases. As I have said for months at this point, I am not worried about tapering. If/when the Fed begins discussing raising interest rates, then I will step back and reassess. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Shares of DocuSign (DOCU) cratered more than 40% after posting disappointing earnings and lowering guidance. Like Zoom (ZM), Teladoc (TDOC), and Peloton (PTON) before, this is the latest COVID stock to crater in value. \n* Shares of Chinese ride-hailing company DIDI gapped down once again after announcing plans to delist from the New York Stock Exchange amid regulatory pressures from the Chinese government. This is one of the most spectacular IPO failures I have ever seen and probably just the beginning. I\u2019m glad I divested all my shares in Chinese companies, I wouldn\u2019t trust a single dollar of mine in that environment. At this point, I\u2019m expecting Alibaba (BABA) to delist at some point. \n* As a reminder, a lot of times, when you buy Chinese stock, you aren\u2019t really buying a share of the company, usually you are being what is called an American Depositary Receipt, which is basically just a contract representing a number of shares, not an actual piece of the company\n* The Federal Trade Commission sued NVIDIA (NDA) to block the proposed $40 billion acquisition of Arm. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t look like the deal will go through given all the regulatory backlash in both the US, UK and EU. Sad for me, NVIDIA is my favorite stock in the market. \n* Ford Motor (F) expects to be the world's second largest electric vehicle manufacturer within two years, with annual production capacity of nearly 600,000, according to Lisa Drake, the Chief Operating Officer. \n* Shares of sport-betting company DraftKings (DKNG) sank to 52-week lows, losing more than 50% of its value in the last three months. Penn National Gaming (PENN) is following a similar trend. \n* Cathie Wood\u2019s flagship Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) hit a 52-week low today, after falling 25% in the month amid the broad tech-selloff. \n* Shares of Grab (GRAB), the largest ride-hailing and digital payment solution in Southeast Asia, failed spectacularly in its first day of trading following the largest ever merger, which valued the company at over $40 billion. Has not been a good week for foreign stocks.  \n* Qualcomm (QCOM) on Wednesday released a new chip designed for gaming-specific handheld devices offering 5G connectivity, a potential new mobile platform for video gamers offering more flexibility to play streaming games on the go. QCOM said it partnered with hardware company Razer to create an initial test device for gamers.\n\n\u201cThe greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.\u201d *-Nelson Mandela*",

        "selftext": "Apparently 70% of crypto movements have been \"wash trading\".  \nsource: [https://www.cber-forum.org/cryptowashtrading](https://www.cber-forum.org/cryptowashtrading)\n\nWhat is Wash trading?\n\nA crypto currency/coin is just an crypto secured code. Does nothing. Just cryptographed code.  \nSo you see the listed market price for a coin?\n\nBasically you can make them go up or down with bidding a higher price then the listed price and executing the trade. (establishing a new market price)\n\nSo someone launches a coin, then they open two or several accounts. And they simply buy the coin, by moving money from one account to the other. Pushing up the listed market price... So it was worth 0$ then now they've moved it up as much as they could with all the money they had.  \nObviously, if the market price gets high enough they can no longer afford to move the price up past $100 if they can only move $100 back and forth between two accounts, buying and selling it.\n\nSomeone else see the market price and says wowwww the price is going up I better buy. Then they simply sell them coins at the price. It gains momentum when people keep buying into it then when the price is high enough and they see not much more people are buying into it, they simply selll allllllll the coins they have stored pushing the price down to 0 to capture all of pending bid prices. And leaving people who bought these \"coins\" with a code with a listed market value of 0.  \nThis is essentially how \"rug pulls\" work. (i.e. the Squid Game token going to 0 and countless others)\n\nBut is bitcoin/ethereum etc. operating the same way????  \nHere is a live trading dashboard of bitcoin: [https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC\\_USDT](https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT)  \nSee how trades are being executed multiple times a second, setting the listed price. I believe it is the same but on a much wider scale.\n\nLook here, at one point, bitcoin crashed to 8k from 65k, because one of their traders \"made a mistake\". source: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-briefly-crashed-87-8-143639198.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-briefly-crashed-87-8-143639198.html)\n\nMore evidence of wash trading of bitcoin here, notice how bitcoin/ethereum listed price move in lockstep despite being \"completely different coins with completely different real world applications\" ? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41\\_uZD9miZw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41_uZD9miZw)\n\nThey need you to buy into it for a reason. Hence, the heavily promoted lies, and aggressive marketing. Of course, they seem to need you to buy but never sell.\n\nWhen the price of bitcoin/ethereum tanked hard, a lot of these exchanges literally shutdown, there by locking people out of their accounts, preventing these people from selling and effectively stealing people's money... They've (coin base, kraken, kukoo etc.) have done this numerous times this year.\n\nSo I ask, if you're \"investing\" in this heavily marketed, energy draining, digital code, with no real world benefit to the economy are you really just playing the game - buy in and dump on others before the people with large amounts of money can dump on you or is there some kind of real economic driver driving up the price of these coins?",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 6th, 2021.\n\n# **More turbulence could be ahead for stocks as investors weigh omicron and the Fed\u2019s next steps - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/03/stocks-could-face-more-turbulence-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Volatility could continue to plague markets after a week of violent swings that sent many stocks plummeting.\n*****\n&gt; In the week ahead, investors await more news on the omicron Covid variant and another inflation report Friday that is expected to show consumer prices remain the hottest in three decades.\n*****\n&gt; In the past week, stocks sold off on worries about the omicron variant and concerns the Federal Reserve will move away from its easy policies and raise interest rates sooner than anticipated. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told a Congressional panel Tuesday that the central bank will consider speeding up the taper of its $120 billion monthly bond-buying program when it meets Dec. 14 and 15. The Federal Reserve put its bond-purchasing program in place in early 2020 to prop up the economy during the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a somewhat turbulent December because we probably need to wait for earnings season to get regrounded, back to fundamentals,\u201d said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset. \u201cFor as high as a lot of the ratios would suggest, price-to-sales, price-to-earnings, when you throw it into the hopper with interest rates and everything else, things aren\u2019t that bad. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re teetering on the edge of a cliff.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But Ablin did say the comments from Powell were unnerving investors, who fear the Fed will also speed up interest rate hikes. Powell acknowledged he was wrong about inflation being \u201ctransitory,\u201d or temporary, spooking investors. The bond purchases are now scheduled to end in June.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI\u2019m not sure what investors\u2019 read on inflation is. Do they think the Fed is going to raise rates, get ahead of it too early and everything is going to roll over? Ever since Powell took \u2018transitory\u2019 out of his talk, investors have been somewhat off balance,\u201d said Ablin.\n*****\n&gt; The consumer price index or CPI for November is expected Friday morning. Economists polled by Dow Jones predict it rose 0.6% on a monthly basis, or 6.7% year over year. That compares to a 0.9% gain in October, and a 6.2% jump year over year, the biggest move in three decades.\n*****\n&gt; # Risky names slammed\nHigh fliers and growth were among the hardest hit Friday, as investors bailed out of some of the riskiest stocks. As stocks plunged Friday, Treasury yields fell. Yields move opposite price, and the move was seen as a flight to safety. The 10-year note yield fell to 1.35%.\n*****\n&gt; The ARK Innovation ETF was down nearly 12.7% for the week. Most of the growth names in the fund plunged into bear market territory. \u201cI think investors have to keep in mind that\u2019s not a 15-week strategy. It\u2019s a 15-year strategy, as far as we\u2019re concerned,\u201d Ablin said.\n*****\n&gt; For the week, the small cap Russell 2000 was down nearly 4%, while the S&amp;P 500 was off just 1.2%. The worst performing major sector for the week was communications services, which includes internet companies. It was down 2.8%, followed by consumer discretionary, off 2.4%. Financials lost nearly 2%, and the S&amp;P technology sector was down 0.4% for the week. But on Friday, tech lost 1.7%.\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve should be quiet in the week ahead. Fed officials traditionally do not make major speeches in the blackout period, which is the coming week, ahead of their Dec. 14 and 15 meeting. One exception is Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari who speaks Thursday at the Center for Indian Country Development Research Summit.\n*****\n&gt; Much of the focus will be on how the market itself is performing.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cEver since the Nov. 22 outside bearish day, all strength has been sold with lots of damage underneath the hood,\u201d said Scott Redler of T3Live.com. \u201cNow finally some of the leadership names are showing faulty action.\u201d He noted that both Microsoft and Apple were weaker.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMoney is not hiding in Amazon, Google, or Facebook. They haven\u2019t been special for weeks,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P closed below its 50-day moving average Friday, after closing below it Wednesday. The 50-day is at 4,544. That\u2019s a signal to some market technicians that the index is on the verge of breaking down. The 50-day moving average is the average closing price over the past 50 days, and is viewed as a momentum indicator.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBasically, it\u2019s effectively a retest of support because we had the relief rally [Thursday],\u201d said Katie Stockton, founder of Fairlead Strategies. She said the S&amp;P 500 needs to close below the 50-day for two consecutive days before the move is considered a breakdown.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe action in the high growth, high multiple names is not a good sign,\u201d said Stockton. \u201cWe do have some signs of downside exhaustion but not as widespread as I would hope. We\u2019re seeing some of the heavyweights, like Adobe for example, taking out levels like the 50-day moving averages.\u201d She said some of those big names have now joined the selling.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re just watching how bad it gets. Monday is going to be the tell,\u201d said Stockton. \u201cThat also gives it the weekend to settle... Extremes have gotten a little bit more extreme. Sentiment is the most oversold from a contrarian perspective since the October low.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/hk2QMMD.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/w6utI7X.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/N8u66xV.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/tagANgL.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/28oKFM3.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/t8zd2PY.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fEvF2Bm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ponrnUL.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SqxThz0.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/r0gUrDf.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/3QmNJUa.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/sz567v5.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/s9GIfxy.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/zBWalJo.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/Cz7EeMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small-Cap Corrections\n\n&gt; At the close on Wednesday (12/1), the small-cap Russell 2,000 had fallen 12.1% from its recent high on November 8th, leaving the index in \"correction\" territory. A market \"correction\" is a drop of 10%+ that was preceded by a rally of at least 10% on a closing basis. This correction for the Russell 2,000 is its 58th since data for the index begins in 1978. Below is a table showing prior corrections for the Russell. The average correction sees the index fall 18.35%, which is just shy of the 20% threshold for a \"bear market.\" The median correction is a little smaller at -15.4%. In terms of length, the average Russell correction has lasted 73 days, while the median is 62 days. For the current Russell 2,000 correction to reach average levels, it would need to fall another 7% from here, and it would come to an end on January 20th, 2022.\n\n&gt; In terms of extremes, the biggest correction that the Russell 2,000 has ever experienced was the 41.9% decline seen during the initial COVID Crash from 1/16/20 to 3/18/20. The longest correction lasted 397 days from 6/24/83 to 7/25/84. In terms of the shortest correction, there were two that lasted 3 days. One of those came during the Financial Crisis while the other happened last June.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/raycorrec.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # December Typically Starts Out Weak\n\n&gt; December typically starts out weak as tax-loss selling ramps up and with the big gains this year we would expect that early December weakness to materialize. Then as you can see in the typical December chart here stocks begin to takeoff around mid-month led by small caps and the Russell 2000.\n\n&gt; This is what used to be known as the \u201cJanuary Effect:\u201d small caps outperforming large caps in the month of January. Nowadays most of the so-called January Effect takes place in the last half of December (2021 Almanac pages 110 &amp; 112, 2022 pages 112 &amp; 114). The January Effect is not to be confused with the January Barometer (2021 Almanac page 16, 2022 page 18), which states as the S&amp;P 500 goes in January, so goes the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/84caf5990b652671445781962a51ee2f/b2ebb400780bd4c8-af/s500x750/1795f2bbf763fb254a002bda32bd9b217881240b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # December Almanac: Small Cap Effect &amp; Santa Claus Rally\n\n&gt; Trading in December is holiday inspired and fueled by a buying bias throughout the month. However, the first part of the month tends to be weaker as tax-loss selling and yearend portfolio restructuring begins. Regardless, December is laden with market seasonality and important events.\n\n&gt; December is the number three S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials month since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% on each index. It\u2019s the second-best Russell 2000 (1979) month and third best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000 (1979). In 2018, DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of 2018 is not all that likely. When December is down it is usually a turning point in the market\u2014near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half of the month.\n\n&gt; In the last seventeen post-election years, December\u2019s ranking slip to #7 S&amp;P 500, #7 NASDAQ and DJIA #5. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, tend to have a field day in post-election-year Decembers. Since 1981, the Russell 2000 has lost ground three time in ten post-election years in December. The average small cap gain in all ten years is a solid 2.2%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/64044be6e473181304fe66b98074cbde/5618185eea1cfe29-fe/s400x600/931f46ef694541cebb05ea5f3193a5faa1f6bc60.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Small caps tend to start to outperform larger caps near the middle of the month (early January Effect) and The \u201cSanta Claus Rally\u201d begins on the open on December 27 and lasts until the second trading day of 2022. Average S&amp;P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%.\n\n&gt; Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down. The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch\u2019s now famous line states, \u201cIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 6 Things To Know About December And Omicron\n\n&gt; Here comes December, historically a pretty solid month for stocks, but now we have the Omicron variant wreaking havoc on markets. \u201cWhat a difference a week makes. A week ago stocks were at all-time highs and the economy was strong. Now all we have are uncertainties and questions,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAs of now we\u2019re optimistic that stocks will sidestep the new variant worries, but we recommend investors buckle up their seatbelts, as the end of 2021 could be a bumpy one.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here are six things to think about as we head into the jolliest month of them all.\n\n&gt; First, historically, the S&amp;P 500 Index has gained 1.5% on average in December, which is the third best month of the year with only April and November better. But as you can see here, over the past 10 years, December has been much weaker. Of course, much of this was due to a huge 9.2% drop in 2018 (which we\u2019ll get to soon enough).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-pic-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Second, some more good news is December has been up 74.3% of the time, more than any other month of the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-2-.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; drop in 2018. Only once in history was December the worst month of the year for the S&amp;P 500 and it was indeed in 2018. Three times it was the second worst month of the year, in 1968, 1980, and 1996. The worst monthly return so far this year was a 4.8% drop in September.\n\n&gt; Fourth, stocks usually don\u2019t get moving until the second half of the month, right as the holiday good feel vibes start to come out.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-pic-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Fifth, this year is in rare air, as all 11 months have made a new all-time high so far. Should the S&amp;P 500 make new highs in December that would be a perfect 12 for 12, matching 2014 as the only years to complete this incredible feat.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-post-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Sixth, as we show in the LPL Chart of the Day, it turns out that when stocks are up more than 20% for the year heading into December (like 2021), the final month actually does better, up 1.7% versus 1.5%. Also, it has been higher eight of the past nine times the year was up more than 20% heading into the final month.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-post-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Job Growth Came Up Short in November\n\n&gt; The domestic economy added just 210,000 jobs during November, well below Bloomberg-surveyed economists\u2019 consensus forecast for a gain of 550,000 and below October\u2019s revised tally of 546,000. The net revision to prior months was positive but only by 82,000.\n\n&gt; The modest 23,000 gain in leisure and hospitality jobs, which were up 170,000 in October, and a 20,000 drop in retail jobs don\u2019t make much sense given solid retail sales data of late. That could set up a positive reversal from revisions next month, though that potential bump will play some tug-of-war with the emergence of the Omicron COVID-19 variant, which came after the November survey period ended.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, for the past four months the pace of job gains has been well below the pre-Delta variant levels of near 1 million back in June and July. However, there are a number of reasons to be optimistic that job growth picks up in early 2022, assuming the Omicron variant doesn\u2019t get in the way.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe job growth number is disappointing, no doubt, especially considering the survey period fell before we even know the name of the newest Covid-19 variant,\u201d noted LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. \u201cWhile Omicron may curb hiring a bit over the next month or two, we remain confident in our expectation for strong job gains and above-average growth in the U.S. economy in 2022.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-pic-12.3.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The story was clearly better when looking at the unemployment rate, derived from the household survey rather than from employers. The unemployment rate unexpectedly fell from 4.6% to 4.2% in November as workers\u2014in an encouraging sign\u2014came off the sidelines (1.14 million of them), lifting the participation rate by 0.2% to 61.8%, a post-recession high but still well off pre-pandemic levels.\n\n&gt; Inflation data also painted a somewhat reassuring picture. The year-over-year increase in average hourly earnings rose less than expected at 4.8% (+0.3% month over month), below consensus expectations of 5.0% and 0.4%, and not enough to keep up with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) over the same period. It\u2019s reasonable to conclude that the increase in labor participation helped limit wage increases, but we have a long way to go there still. The labor market is still 3.9 million jobs below pre-pandemic levels and the labor market remains under-supplied, as noted above. In other words, further improvement in participation will still be needed to help contain inflation pressure.\n\n&gt; Some will argue that this report will make the Federal Reserve (Fed) think twice before accelerating tapering of its bond purchases, but we\u2019re not so sure.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere were a number of positives with this jobs report,\u201d explained LPL Financial Fixed Income Strategist Lawrence Gillum. \u201cLabor force participation increased and the unemployment rate fell\u2014both of which point to a continued strong jobs market. That may give the Fed reasons to speed up its tapering plans.\u201d\n\n&gt; Overall, this report is a disappointing reminder that we\u2019re going to have to wait longer for the booming jobs numbers that we still expect to see. We continue to expect more people to get back to work in the months ahead, in an environment of strong labor demand, which can help alleviate wage pressure and firm up the economic growth outlook. Omicron is a risk but based on the information we have today, we do not expect that variant, or any others, to meaningfully slow the job market recovery in 2022.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending December 3rd, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.5.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * (**$COUP $MDB $HQY $GTLB $SUMO $AZO $DBI $ALCO $CHPT $PLAY $SFIX $TOL $SOL $PD $S $CDMO $AVAV $LOVE $GME $RH $PATH $GEF $OXM $CHWY $LULU $COST $ORCL $AVGO $MTN $KLXE $KSPN $ASO**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/r0gUrDf.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/evjwA2L.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.6.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/br3K0zL.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.6.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hbGoBFe.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  12.7.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tM8wghC.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 12.7.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hhcFlGr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.8.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/lPByiPr.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.8.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FNjpxcY.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.9.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2PUPQhA.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.9.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/6kqQxly.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.10.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/OcHR8nI.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.10.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n&gt; **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.),\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/smallstreetbets. :)",
