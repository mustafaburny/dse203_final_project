        "selftext": "  \n\n**Microvast DD &amp; catalysts** \n\nFirst off well done to anyone who got in on this trade. It\u2019s been a long hold for a lot of people, if you were lucky enough to spot my DD early last week you could have got in at a very nice price. \n\nFollowing on from my DD post on Sunday I want to talk about what now know from the investor presentation and also discuss what catalysts Microvast have coming up. I think you will like what I have to say.\n\n**Takings from Microvast investors Presentation** \n\nHave been looking forward to seeing this document for 3 months now and it didn\u2019t disappoint, we need to give big Credit to Stephen Vogel, the Tuscan team and the sponsor InterPrivate for delivering but now it\u2019s time to focus on Microvast. I\u2019ve linked a copy of the presentation and investors call below but here are my key takings:\n\n\u00b7 Starting with the leadership it is good to see we have an extremely experienced team with lead by Yang Wu the CEO.\n\n\u00b7 Company valued at $3 Billion- this was in the upper limit of what I expected but very good, gives the share price a lot of room to grow.\n\n\u00b7 MicroVast at a glance- gives a real good and easy to understand high level summary of what this company is all about and where they are headed with a roadmap.\n\n\u00b7 I liked how they have identified new Target markets in Passenger vehicles, Energy Storage and battery components, this will serve them well in the long run and its exciting to think how much of a market share the will be able to get with a very large addressable market.\n\n\u00b7 They have best in class in battery cell technology with ultra-fast charge, high power and high energy density with a very impressive pipeline of new products and intellectual property IP on battery tech.\n\n\u00b7 Massive Contract with CNHI/FPT securing a $1.5Bn contract- this Is massive as it shows a steady stream of revenue and puts the Argument that the company may be struggling with revenues to bed.\n\n\u00b7 Customer partnerships with names such as IVECO, Porsche and OAHKOSH\n\n\u00b7 R&amp;D partnerships with United states council for automotive research (USCAR), Argonne and most Notably BMW.\n\n\u00b7 Identified $5.9Bn in possible contract revenues with visibility as far as 2025 in a fast growing sector with stable margins.\n\n\u00b7 How valuation was calculated and how Microvast plan to use money raised to expand \u2018world-class manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and Europe; total estimated global capacity of 9 GWh by 2022\u2019 \n\n\u00b7 Benchmark well against similar companies in terms of operations and valuation. And a 64% CAGR is Very impressive\n\nI\u2019m very impressed with the presentation and a lot of questions surrounding the Revenues, contracts, valuation and growth have been answered.\n\n**Microvast Known Catalysts:**\n\nIn the short to medium term there a number of catalysts that I think will affect the share price positively:\n\n\u00b7 A date will be set for a vote to merge and the stock price will move in anticipation to this.\n\n\u00b7 I expect after the ticker change there could be a small dip in price with people taking profits, however, There is touted overwhelming interest in this SPAC in Asia (China, Japan, South Korea) by all accounts, and if true, Chinese hedge funds will make this parabolic on ticker change.\n\n\u00b7 Opening of the new factory in Germany and start of production, this is expected to happen in Spring and would be a really nice catalyst to accompany the ticker change to $MVST.\n\n\u00b7 Advanced discussion with two other Marquee Global customers which if executed could provide an additional $3Bn in contracted revenue through 2028. From previous DD and just connecting the dots I think these 4 are the front runners: Tesla, Mercedes, General motors and Ford.\n\n\u00b7 Beginning of construction for new plant in Clarkesville, TN with production expected to in early 2022.\n\n\u00b7 And last but not least CRAMER- love him or hate him his coverage of any stock gets their name out there with his large audience (HYPE).\n\n\u2022 Ark invest may also want in on the action (my own speculation)\n\nOverall it was a great day and a huge relief for everyone who has been getting nervous holding. If you managed to resist the urge to sell today I think these catalysts will make your Diamon hands even stronger.\n\nFor people who didn\u2019t get in early I still see value here given the catalysts above and the future revenue and growth projections. My advice would be to wait for dips to add a starting position with dollar cost averaging being the tactic. If the share price opens high tomorrow wait for a opportunity to buy when the gap created trys to fill like seen today when we opened above the ATH of $20.93.\n\nI Predicted a move of 50% plus with DA announcement. Short term I can see the share price going on a run Similar like what was seen with $SHLL ($40/50+) only I have a lot more confidence in Microvast holding a high price post ticker change similar to $DKNG (holding $50 well). \n\nLong-term if you are willing to hold until 2025 I think this stock will easily surpass $100 based on the current projections. I personally will be holding the majority of my position. I took some profits today and added a new position in $COUV which is another battery play I will release DD on soon.\n\nHappy Merger Monday\n\n**Links**\n\n**1)** **http://www.microvast.com/index.php/about/investors**",

        "selftext": "Hello All, this is my first DD. It is long but I hope you will enjoy it. I  wanted to do an in-depth dive into the company Forum Merger 3 (FIII) ,  who is merging with Electric Last Mile Solutions, an EV company  specializing in last mile delivery and work vans. FIII will be the first  and only Class 1 electric vehicle on the market, coming as early as Q3,  with no other Class 1 EV as competition. They are also bringing a Class  2 EV truck to market next year. A key factor in allowing ELMS to be  first to market in Class 1 is the fact that they are taking over the old  Hummer plant in Indiana. Additionally, they have the luxury of working  with an already successful EV company, allowing for instant  transposition of truck plans ready for production.FIII has intrigued me  from the get go being an EV SPAC, yet it has received little to no  attention which is reflected in the current stock price. There has been  little to no movement on the stock other than some sideways and  downwards action, which is atypical behavior for most EV SPACs. So what  gives?After doing some digging, it appears that the main concern holding  back most investors back from committing to this great company is their  connection and relations to (((CHINA))), which comes by way of a  company in particular called Sokon Automotive.This concern is not  unwarranted, as ties to China have been an issue of concern in the  market lately. As investors, especially when dealing with new companies,  we want maximum transparency, which seems almost impossible any time  we're dealing with a Chinese company. However, as my research has shown,  the ELMS relationship with China is nothing to be concerned about. In  fact, it is quite the opposite \u2013 something that will help propel them  forward and accelerate their process through previously successfully  developed truck plans and numerous industry connections.\n\n# I.  The Team\n\nFirst,  let's take a look at who is behind the team. As we have come to know, a  SPAC is only as good as the team behind it. The team behind ELMS is an   All-Star cast of players in the auto industry with years of experience  and accomplishments.  After looking into each of the team members, some  interesting connections emerged amongst them and amongst different   auto/EV companies(including a connection to Tesla) . These connections  made some of the pieces start to fall into place. In particular, I  wanted to figure out more so their connection to the Chinese players.  Was it sketchy and something to be concerned about? After digging deeper  my questions were answered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The AllStars](https://preview.redd.it/7nuwaytesih61.png?width=989&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=545c748bd1fe6d8c68ced28d5ec2b3b14dab7bd2)\n\n***The Allstars*** ***-***\n\n**James (Jim) Taylor** \u2013 35+ years experience \u2013 CEO and Founder of ELMS, former executive at **Karma**. Former CEO of **Workhorse,**  he pivoted the company\u2019s focus from the electrification of cars and  SUVs to medium duty commercial trucks. Former CEO of SF Motors, now  known as Seres(owned by Sokon, the company they are working with).  Worked at **General Motors**, serving as President of **Cadillac** and CEO of **Hummer**.  Led the design and technology upgrading of the new model of Cadillac,  which contributed to the revival of the brand. This guy is the  powerhouse behind ELMS. James knows what it takes to build a company and  what it takes to pivot to the emerging world of  EVs. He probably has  some of the most experience of anyone in the industry when it comes to  EVs, having worked on both Karma (with Henrik Fisker of FSR) and  Workhorse which we all know. His innovation and experience on developing  different types of EVs, will allow for future design and build  improvements. Jim, also Canadian, is known as \u201cThe Great One\u201d when it  comes to the EV world. He is also known as Jim \u201cThe EV Man\u201d Taylor,  because like the show Home Improvement, he is always building and  innovating in the garage.\n\n**Jason Luo** \u2013 25+ years experience -  Executive Chairman and Co-Founder of ELMS. Former CEO of Key Safety Systems, **Ford** China and **Accuride**.   Jason served for nearly a decade as CEO of Key Safety Systems (now  Joyson Safety Systems), one of the largest automotive safety companies  in the world.  Oversaw the company\u2019s acquisition of Takata Corporation  for $1.6 billion. Jason currently serves on the board of directors of  Accuride, Elo Touch Solutions, ATC Drivetrain and Sybridge Technologies.   He has extensive experience in the automotive world and more  importantly with large companies. In addition he has been through a few  different mergers and acquisitions which is an added benefit. He knows  what it takes to come out on top.\n\n**Shauna McIntyre, -** 20+ years **-** CEO, Sense Photonics, Inc. (LiDAR) and Former program lead, **Google** automotive services, **Alphabet**,  Inc .  She previously led Google\u2019s automotive services program, during  which time she released Google products, including Google Maps, into  automakers\u2019 new vehicle models. Since 2019, she has served on the Board  of Directors of Lithia Motors, the world's 3rd largest auto dealer.  One  interesting piece of info I found is that she is the co-founder of a  group called **The North American Council for Freight Efficiency**  (NACFE). They focus specifically on turning the transportation industry  into a more economical and EV friendly space. One video I found on  their group website was called \u201cHigh-Potential Regions for Electric  Truck Deployments\u201d. It talked about geographical areas they want to  focus on and develop \u2013 one of them being the Great Lakes. Guess where  the new ELMS factory will be? Right around the Great Lakes.  This group  puts out monthly newsletters and events , so she can use this board as a  means to spread the word throughout the industry. Interestingly enough,  this group just started running an EV truck demo for data collection  and analytics, and two of the companies already involved are  GIK(Lightning E-motors) and Workhorse.\n\n**Richard Peretz, -** 40+ years **-**  Former CFO, **United Parcel Service (UPS)**,   during which time he opened UPS operations in China. Richard also  helped expand the company\u2019s international  footprint in many European  and Asian countries. You can bet that this will help ELMS get some  international connections. Hes overseen numerous acquisitions, as well  as being a leading member of the team that managed UPS\u2019s IPO in 1999, at  the time the largest in U.S. history. He is no stranger to  understanding what it takes to make a new operation a successful one.\n\n**Brian Krzanich, -** 25+ years -  CEO, CDK Global (one of the biggest technologies for dealerships) and Former CEO, **Intel Corporation**.  Oversaw the acquisition of companies such as autonomous driving company  Mobileye. This guy is a pimp daddy. He was forced to resign from Intel  because he got caught having a relationship with an employee. You could  say she really turned his software into hardware! Brian currently serves  on the boards of AMS AG and Footprint US (sustainable technology). He  previously served on the Boards of Deere &amp; Company and Semiconductor  Industry Association, as well as serving as the Chair of the FAA Drone  Advisory Committee. He is the go to guy for the chips and computers for  the vehicles. This will help with any autonomous driving they have  planned, as well as their on board ELMS AIR system (more on this later).\n\n**Neil Goldberg**,  - 45+ yrs \u2013 Director of Forum, Chairman and CEO, Raymour &amp;  Flannigan Furniture and Holdings. Many years of retailing, merchandising  and general management experience.\n\n**David Boris \u2013**  30+ years - Co-CEO and CFO, Forum Merger III Corporation. Has been  involved in approximately 20 SPAC transactions as a board member,  underwriter and M&amp;A advisor.   Director of Tattooed Chef, Inc.,  which completed its merger with Forum Merger II Corporation in October  2020. TTCF has done suprisingly well, despite it being one SPAC that I  was not fond of due to my nutrition background. I think the food itself  is over priced crap but it has held steady in price ever since merger  completion. This bodes well for FIII.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The Players](https://preview.redd.it/ebsz6bygsih61.png?width=1227&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd9ab4dfdaf343e54fd6ea5cd803f1358fe53a77)\n\n***Other Members of the Team*** ***-***\n\n***Jerry Hu***  \u2013 25+ years - COO , Safety expert, global operation leadership and Asia  head for Key Safety Systems, commercial leadership and other management  at **Accuride** and **Volkswagen.**\n\n***Justin Prann*** \u2013 15+ years \u2013 CCO , National VP of Sales and Service for **Mahindra Automotive** North America (in the running for the USPS contract), senior positions within **BMW** North America.\n\n***Kev Adjemian*** **\u2013** 20+ years \u2013 CTO, Global Head of Battery Cells at **Fiat** **Chrysler** Automobiles and VP of Powertrain and EV Systems, including OTA, at **Karma**. Fuel cell, battery and electric powertrain R&amp;D leadership at **Nissan.**\n\n***Albert Li*** \u2013 20+ years - CFO of EV startup Byton(led by Carsten Breitfeld , the now ceo of Farraday Future), and **Ford** China, senior positions at Bombardier in charge of aerospace operations in China.\n\n***Benjamin Wu***  \u2013 15+ years \u2013 GC, Chief Legal Officer and Administration    head for  Meridian, with extensive experience in M&amp;A and international  corporate transactions for both private and public companies.\n\nSo  as we can, see this team is ridiculously good and has excellent  connections that run deep, not only in the US , but in China, and other  places around the world. The fact that the Chinese companies that are  connected with the team include the likes of Ford and UPS, tell me that  there is a legitimacy to their business dealings. This team covers many  bases that are necessary for ELMS to be a top contender in the ev world.  These players have tons of experience, have held top level positions at  top tier companies, and have the knowledge and know-how in many  different aspects of electric vehicles and the industry overall.\n\n# II. What Does ELMS Do?\n\nNow  that we know who ELMS is , lets take a look at what exactly they  do.ELMS offers the only Class 1 EV in an underserved commercial delivery  industry.  Some of the advantages ELMS has over other EV companies  include:\n\n\u25aaFirst and Only Class 1 .  The fact that they are a first mover is absolutely HUGE for  establishing themselves and cashing in on the opportunity of being alone  in the field.\n\n\u25aaFactory in Indiana already kitted out for EV production\n\n\u25aaCars ready by Q3 of this year. Most EV SPACs aren't on the road until 2022 and later\n\n\u25aaLowest total cost of ownership in Class 1\n\n\u25aaAlready proven successful product based off top selling 2020 EV model in China\n\nHere is a pretty chart comparing them to some competitors. Note \u2013 this is from December so it may have changed some since.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Only Class 1 - no other competition](https://preview.redd.it/fkf5byrjsih61.png?width=1719&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=918b7c37a441b1dc5db3308cc03adde6b62b12a4)\n\nThe  ELMS Urban Delivery van costs the same or cheaper as its gasoline  counterparts ($32,500-7500 credit =$25k),  but has 35% more cargo space ,  at 170 cubic ft, and a cheaper total cost of ownership by 35% (50%  compared to a class 2). The cost per year comes to around $1550 for ELMS  Urban Delivery vs $4000 for a regular gas Class 1. It becomes even  cheaper when you factor in the extra cargo volume per cubic ft that it  provides.The 2022 Class 2/3 model will have 218ft. It appears that they  have plans to make different variations of their Class 1 and Class 3,  being able to turn them into Class 2s as well based off individual  needs. They will have a range of 150 to 200 miles and be capable of a  full recharge in as little as two hours. These types of vans are used in  many capacities of our society. For example, delivery and ecommerce  (Amazon, Fedex, DHL), communications (Verizon, Comcast), small  businesses (local flower shop, food trucks), and utility and local  municipality vehicles. There is no lack of demand for these types of  vehicles.\n\nA cool feature that will  probably be a huge sales point for ELMS that I think has been  overlooked, is that they will be upfitting the vans themselves.  Upfitting is the process of taking the vehicle to a specialist to be  equipped to meet the specific needs of that business. This includes  things like installing custom drawers and cabinets, shelving, lighting,  power supplies, etc. The typical upfitting process involves a 3rd party  vendor or sometimes numerous different ones, and takes on avg 130-140  days from order to delivery. The ELMS custom upfitting process allows  for :\n\n\u25aa \\~25% reduction time from order to delivery\n\n\u25aa One warranty single point of contact for customer\n\n\u25aa  Total vehicle value chain cost reduced by 5+%ELMS are also currently in  talks with the leading upfitter brands IVS, Adrian Steel, and Auto  Truck Group.\n\nI have found no other EV that has said they will be doing something like this yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Custom Upfitting for any business needs. Takes out need for 3rd party.](https://preview.redd.it/ivxxq0ylsih61.png?width=1716&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=046d1737914b20c2561b902b67e06b1df73f829d)\n\nNext,  the ELMS vehicles will be connected with a system called ELMS AIR, an  over-the-air programming system. I have not been able to find much  information about any specifics except for some clues in their investor  presentation.  They will use these over-the-air data systems in  partnership with the industry leading Geotab to provide many benefits to  their customers. Some areas that will be serviced include :\n\n\u25aaProductivity - accurate arrival and departure times ,true trip miles\n\n\u25aaOptimization - increase energy efficiency, record powertrain diagnostics, vehicle maintenance\n\n\u25aaCompliance - electronic driver logs, tax reporting, vehicle inspection reports\n\n\u25aaExpandability - system integration, hardware add-ons &amp; software add-ins\n\nSome  of the obvious benefits of a type of system, like we see in Tesla for  example, are the ability for the software updates to happen frequently  and easily, along with data  constantly being in communication with the  main servers. The more data that is able to be collected, the better  optimized these services and vehicles can be. The experience and  knowledge of BigPoppa Brian Krzanich from Intel will  be valuable in  this aspect. What we will end up seeing with a system like this is more  and more areas of value for the companies buying it. For example, there  will be savings from being able to easily collect accurate tax data and  driving logs from the drivers. Time will also be saved with something  such as the automated updates and knowing exactly when a van will need  to be serviced or inspected. As time goes on and more data becomes  collected, the ELMS AIR service will only prove to be more valuable for  both the company and their customers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ion6yennsih61.png?width=1205&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90f939ab66bef8d563902529c59681d7de2aaa2b\n\n# III. Sales and Financials\n\nThe  FIII team has  $250 million in trust, and $155M PIPE in connection with  the merger. ELMS will have a  $1.4billion enterprise value at closing.  The ELMS team is expected to have $379 million of cash to fund  operations and growth. They have said that no additional capital  requirements are needed after close to achieve positive cash flow.  With  their $379 million cash minus $150mill in debt, that gives us $229  million in net cash to work with. There are a total of 142,500,000  shares. Current market cap at the share price of $12, gives us $1.71  billion.\n\nELMS currently has 30,000  pre-orders for its delivery van, representing a revenue of $1billion.  They expect another 30,000 to 60,000 orders by the middle of 2021. Some  of the companies they are in talks with or have preorders from already,  include: Penske, Cox + Siemens (cant make that up), Merchants,  Enterprise, IVS, and others. These contracts will work directly with  companies such as Ikea, Best Buy, Walmart, Fedex, Ryder and more. The  experience and connections of the team will no doubt lead to more  contracts in the future.\n\nThe ELMS  business plan includes a conservative volume ramp, with approximately  4,000 vehicles expected to be delivered by the fourth quarter of 2021,  accelerating to approximately 19,000 deliveries in 2022, and  approximately 35,000 deliveries in 2023. \u201cOur team collectively has  decades of experience launching vehicles for global OEMs, and so while  the facility has an annual production capacity of 100,000 units, we are  deliberately conservative in our initial volumes so that we can be  laser-focused on quality and, as a new brand, establishing an excellent  reputation with our customers.\u201d\n\nI  have seen some grumblings about the fine print of the 30,000 preorders  being \u201ccontingent upon satisfaction of customer requirements.\u201d As you  will see shortly, this is a successful and more than satisfactory  vehicle and has been proven to be so based off its Chinese sales all  year. I have zero doubt that this team will give the customers  everything they want and then some. If anything, I would expect the ELMS  vehicles be even better than their Sokon counterpart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Companies ELMS is in talks with or has pre-orders from.](https://preview.redd.it/e70l425psih61.png?width=1724&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4db1f03d707a18ffe69c02aa8a53ae4d24135ae4)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*Put on your tinfoil hat and sunglasses and follow me real quick\\*\\*\\*\\***\n\n*THEORY #1*: ELMS will receive a future contract due to its relation to the new **Secretary of  Transportation, Pete Buttigieg**.  Before his run for president last year, good ole Petey boy was the  mayor of South Bend, Indiana. He has been known to have very mixed  results there in terms of popularity, but he did put an emphasis on  creating more jobs and projects to rebuild the area. Guess where the new  ELMS factory is located? Yup, literally right next to South Bend in the  bordering town of Mishikawa. Could it be possible that ELMS will have  first priority now for any new government contracts relating to EV  delivery or services, or maybe additional funding/credits? Quite  possibly. We all know of Biden's plan to electrify the US, and now Mayor  Pete has a perfect opportunity to give back to his hometown and bring  more jobs and prosperity to South Bend and the surrounding areas.\n\n*THEORY #2*:  This picture right here was mentioned in the investor presentation when  they were giving examples of how their trucks will be used for  municipalities. At first glance I thought nothing of it and said hey  just some random counties they have worked with. The Michigan and  Indiana seals make sense since that's where they are located. And the  California ones also since that's where most of the former employees and  Seres motors was headquartered. But then I noticed the top left seal,  from Fairfax, Virginia. This just so happens to be right next to my  hometown so I am very familiar with this area. Why does the Fairfax, VA  seal appear alongside those of Michigan, Indiana, and California?  A  side note about Fairfax County \u2013 it is very wealthy and very liberal.  Turns out they have quite a few Green Initiatives in action. Last year  they stated that \u201cOne-hundred percent of eligible county vehicles  scheduled for purchase in fiscal year 2021 shall be replaced with  electric vehicles and the infrastructure needed can be supported in  fiscal year 2021.\u201d  Just a few weeks ago another article stated \u201cFairfax  County Public Schools is getting its first electric school bus today as  part of a statewide initiative led by Dominion Energy.\u201d Interesting! It  seems quite obvious Fairfax County is gearing up for wide scale EV  adoption, and wants to do implement it as soon as possible. Maryland and  D.C. rank 8th and 9th for highest rate of EV adoption, while Virginia  ranks 23rd. You can be damn sure they will be looking to improve on that  number.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Peculiar  section of their investors presentation which shows Fairfax County, VA  in the top left. Could these be potential county contracts they are  working on?](https://preview.redd.it/654d951rsih61.png?width=610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d86a264c5a413a3f93f0c7cff53de70d08cc7e19)\n\nSpeaking of government contracts, ELMS has **ALREADY**  received funding from the state of Indiana.  In late December, the  Indiana Economic Development Corporation (IEDC), which leads the state\u2019s  economic development efforts,  offered ELMS a series of conditional tax  credits and training grants based on its plans to create new jobs in  its factory. The IEDC offered up to **$10 million** in conditional tax credits and up to **$200,000** in conditional training grants based on the company\u2019s job creation plans. The IEDC also offered up to **$2.8 million**  in conditional tax credits from the Hoosier Business Investment (HBI)  tax credit program based on the company\u2019s planned capital investment in  Indiana. This may not be that much money-wise, but it is an excellent  start to pave the way for future endeavors.\n\nAnother  huge benefit for ELMS is that they have a fraction of the typical  startup cost for EV production. The typical cost for entry into the N.A.  market is around  $1.6 billion. With the help of the already successful  Sokon, which provided about $570 million of investments already, ELMS  only needs to contribute around $160 million. This gives them much more  wiggle room to grow and try new things.If we compare ELMS money  situation versus other EV competitors, \u201cRivian\u2019s becoming the poster  child, smoking through $2 billion, $3 billion,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIf you  think $200 million to $300 million for product engineering, ours is $80  million, That\u2019s really just airbags, seat belts and adapting to \\[U.S.  safety requirements\\]. Tooling is already in place because SERES spent  $20 million for the canceled SUV plans. Earlier post-Hummer occupants  also left some usable equipment behind. \u201cComing off the existing  platform is worth hundreds of millions,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cSupplier tooling  alone would normally be a couple hundred million.\u201d Well, that's a  bargain.\n\nThe institutional ownership of FIII has been climbing recently. There has  been multiple funds purchasing within the last week:\n\n\u25aaAlpine  Global Management, bought 2,135,286 shares (valued around  $25.6million), equaling 8.3% of FIII. One of the biggest purchases so  far.\n\n\u25aaBNP Paribas Asset Management UK - 1,665,354 shares (\\~$20million) \u25aaPhoenix Holdings Ltd \u2013 1,103,741 shares (\\~$12million)\n\n\u25aaBank of America \u2013 70k shares (\\~$1mill)\n\n\u25aaToronto Dominion Bank \u2013 15k shares (\\~$203k)\n\n\u25aaSTA Wealth Management \u2013 13k shares (\\~$176k)\n\n\u25aaUBS Group \u2013 Increased holdings by 90% to 14,418 shares (\\~$200k)\n\nWe also have in the past month:\n\n\u25aaPolar Asset Management Partners Inc. bought a stake worth $10,935,000.\n\n\u25aaP Schoenfeld Asset Management LP bought a stake worth $5,964,000.\n\n\u25aaGabelli &amp; Co Investment Adviers bought a stake worth $1,772,000.\n\n\u25aaJefferies Group LLC bought a stake worth $1,305,000.\n\nI  have not seen an official number but the closest figure I can find for  total institutional ownership is around 25-30% . I would imagine this  will get larger once there is an official merger date.\n\nAs  investors, we would like to see alternative revenue streams to help the  company grow. ELMS has plans for a few different ways to increase their  business. One of the main ways is that they will produce their vans for  the entire North American market (CA and Mexico), Europe, and China.  Just from the Chinese sales alone, ELMS is estimating a potential upside  of $300 million. The other major way ELMS will increase revenue is  through the monitization of their ELMS AIR data. They will gather and  mine all the data and services from their vehicles and then use this to  provide valuable information that other companies will want to buy. They  will also use this data to optimize and reduce fleet insurance costs.   This data has an estimated upside of around $50-100 million in increased  revenue. As volume and sales also increase, they will introduce  passenger van models, as well as rental or subscription based services.\n\nSome key takeaways from the ELMS financial situation :\n\n\u25aaNo additional capital expected to be required after merger close to fund initial product launches\n\n\u25aaProjected to be Cash Flow Positive by Q42022\n\n\u25aaEstimated 83,000 Units by 2025, representing \\~5% of U.S. Market\n\n\u25aaRevenue projected to reach $3 Billion and EBITDA estimated at $791 Million by end of 2025\n\n# IV. The Indiana Factory\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Former Hummer plant that is EV kitted and ready for production in Indiana.](https://preview.redd.it/ih444ymtsih61.png?width=1097&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7220a5c0179175a34a8d4dac49b03d7710507ef)\n\nAnother **MASSIVE**  way that ELMS will save a boatload of cash, and speed up the production  of their van, is through the former Hummer plant that they will be  taking over in Mishawaka, Indiana. This plant was originally used for GM  and Hummer, and then once they folded it got taken over by James Taylor  and his former company, Seres.  This plant has the capacity to assemble  100,000 vehicles annually, something that ELMS will most likely need to  do by next year. The Indiana Office of Economic Development Executive  Director Bill Schalliol says \u201cELMS has worked out a deal with the United  Autoworkers Union, which has represented workers at this plant in  recent years. ELMS will initially launch with 140 workers, increasing  staffing to 450 workers when it reaches full production on one line of  smaller vans. Within four years, the company could have 960 employees if  it produces a second assembly line, manufacturing larger sized delivery  vans.\u201d The Mishawaka plant was selected because it has been retrofitted  already for electric vehicle production, and has a strong supply chain  and experienced workforce available. Seres had already put **$130 million** into building this plant for EV use. How nice of them.\n\nAnother  bonus that will help with the quality and speed of production \u2013 workers  who are already familiar with the plant and assembly line. The land  itself is not fully used yet either, and can be used as a future site  for in house manufacturing of parts.\n\nIn  addition to this plant, as of January, a new global headquarters with  31,000 square feet of space and capacity for nearly 200 employees has  been built in Troy, Michigan. The global headquarters strategically  positions ELMS in the center of a network of suppliers and partners and  provides access to one of the world\u2019s best automotive talent pools. The  state-of-the-art facility includes an over 15,000 square feet prototype  lab, where ELMS plans to assemble initial battery pack and electric  motor prototypes as well as complete pre-production vehicle builds. ELMS  also plans to utilize the facility as a customer center where it can  work with customers to understand their vehicle specifications and  analytics needs, as well as conduct test drives.   \u201cIn addition to  facilitating our growth, the design of our new global headquarters will  allow for collaboration across all aspects of our engineering \u2013 from  vehicle design, prototyping and software development \u2013 and customer  engagement, enabling ELMS to deliver for its customers the most  efficient and customized solutions for their last mile use cases,\u201d said  James Taylor.\n\nELMS plans to open  additional offices in California and other locations in proximity to  major EV talent and development hubs\u201cELMS plans to build around 4,100  vans by the end of 2021, more than double output to 9,100 vehicles in  2022 when the second vehicle is added, and grow to 83,000 for both by  2025. The vehicle and plant are said to be **90% Ready for U.S. Production**.\u201d\n\nDid you read that? **90% READY** !  What other EV SPAC is at this level? Very few, if any at all.\n\n# V. Sokon Auto and ELMS Connection\n\nOk,  sounds good you say. But what's the deal with this Chinese company that  we've never heard of? Sokon..sokon my what?! Oh that Sokon. Yes,  officially called Dongfeng Sokon, known internationally as DFSK. They  have been around since 2003, and are well established in the Chinese  auto world. They are one of the top 3 manufacturers, actually. Sokon has  a proven product and demand.  They have over 200,000 gas models, plus  30,000+ EVs sold in Asia. That equates to over 1 million miles driven a  day just off their EVs alone. On top of that, they were the **TOP SELLING EV MODEL in 1H 2020**  in all of China. Again, Sokon is no no-name company. It has a large  customer base for their EV fleet, and these are some legitimate  companies that even me and you can recognize. This includes ecommerce  delivery for JD.com and Ali Baba, postal service for the China Post,  utilities for the state grid, and shuttles for the Hong Kong  International Airport.\n\n**Ok, so I guess this isn't some shady random backroom Chinese vaporware  company. So how are they involved with ELMS?**\n\nThis  takes us back to Seres, formally known as SF Motors, the company our  very own Jim 'the EV Man' Taylor was CEO of in 2019. Seres was created  in 2016 and ended up being bought and owned by Sokon. An interesting  side; note, one of the early members of Seres was the cofounder and  former CEO of Tesla, Martin Eberhard. Guess where Martin worked before  this? A little company called Atieva, now known as Lucid Motors! (CCIV  GANG IN THE HOUSE!! They are my #2 to my #1 baby here. I'm sorry for  cheating on you FIII!!)\n\nOne thing I  want to talk about briefly, as well, is something I have seen mentioned  regarding \u201cbad reviews\u201d from employees online about Seres (Glassdoor I  believe). This has been cited as a reason for concern and uncertainty in  regards to how the leadership behind ELMS will function. As shown  earlier, the team and leaders we have here will be the least of our  worries when it comes to whipping a formidable team and workforce  together. Jim only started working around May, and Seres had already  been bleeding cash and laying off workers. The combination of increasing  tensions with China and the hardships of trying into expand in multiple  countries at once, caused the eventual dissolution of Seres in the US.   I have wondered also if most of these reviews were due to turmoil going  on between specific people in the company, such as Martin Eberhard and  other CEOs. He did get into it with meme lord Elon and that ended up  leading to his ousting at Tesla. At Seres, he also ended up leaving them  in less than a year and he took people along with him to another EV  startup. Doesn't sound like much of a team player.\n\nSeres  ended up ceasing their US operations, but has continued to survive  overseas and has successful models in the Dutch market. They will be  producing a Seres 5 and Seres 7 this year. It doesn't look too bad to be  honest - kind of like a Porsche Cayenne.\n\n**Now that we know who Sokon is, and have alleviated the concern of them being an unknown entity, what can they do for ELMS?**\n\nWell,  they will get many benefits from this partnership. They get the  existing EV product portfolio of Sokon, greatly decreasing the time and  R+D needed to get off the ground. As mentioned before, there is already a  demand and proven product with these models. No guess work needed. On  top of that, they get the customer field experience and warranty data  from the millions of miles already driven in these cars. This will give  ELMS a huge head start to develop and improve many aspects of their  automated systems and ELMS AIR. The high volume of existing supplier  based contracts will be used to their advantage as well. There will be  absolutely no lack of connections or reach that this allstar team won't  be able to tap into. And then of course, the amount of money saved from  the Mishawaka plant and already invested Sokon development, is well over  half a billion dollars. Nice.\n\n# VI. Is This A Chinese Company?\n\nThe  last thing I want to mention in relation to China and ELMS, is the  important question of: \u201cIs this a Chinese company or not?\u201d\n\n**The short and easy answer is NO.**\n\n**ELMS is an Independent U.S. Entity**\n\n**They will provide Made-In-USA EVs.**\n\nSokon  will provide the body production parts for ELMS, and CATL (Tesla  supplier) will provide the batteries. They will use domestic supply for  the EV powertrain. The inverter and the chassis skateboard design for  the batteries will be sourced in the U.S. Unfortunately, ELMS cannot go  fully domestic yet, but is hoping to transition as much as possible in  the future. Right now, they are also focused on making sure they can get  an attractive and affordable price point to its customers. \u201cHey, made  in America. Made in Mishawaka. Half of it\u2019s American,\u201d he said. \u201cOur  engineers are here. The software guys. The homologation is all based in  Auburn Hills \\[Michigan\\]. We plan to source the majority of our EV  systems and componentry here in the U.S.   \u201cYou\u2019ll be going into the  FedExes, Walmarts, all these guys. I\u2019d say there\u2019s a low chance to sell  them a Chinese truck,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cBut after we\u2019re finished, it should  be looked at as just a few parts from China. If we move all the way  into vertical integration, we\u2019re like everybody else. I\u2019m not sure we  can hang onto that price point.\u201d  So as we can see, there is some  strategy here at play in order to secure some of these early and first  mover advantage contracts.\n\n# VII. Technical Analysis\n\nHad  to delete this because reached max character limit. Pretty much nothing  overly bearish or bullish. FIII broke below resistance the past 2 days  of the 55 EMA, so this week we will look for it to rise above it and  turn it from resistance back into support. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/59871x0ysih61.png?width=1816&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebd91fcd7da6cbbafcf5a336af79f9e23c0747e7\n\n# VIII. Conclusion\n\nIf  you made it this far, congratulations. This was a journey to China and  back. I hope from reading this, you, like me, have become much more  confident and aware of the future potential of this amazing new company  called Electric Last Mile Solutions.  I came into this looking to  alleviate some of my worries about the stagnant and seemingly void or  negative energy surrounding this company. I came out the other end a  changed man. They say money doesn't grow on trees, but they missed one.  The ELMS tree. And it has acorns for all of us.\n\nCome, watch this tree grow with me, friend.\n\n[The ELMS tree](https://preview.redd.it/05c5j9o4tih61.jpg?width=791&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94648f9e4e79c77df21e06307962fc64daed3f09)\n\n^(Positions: 10,000 warrants, 850 commons)\n\n^(Note: Options just came out last week. Will be accumulating March 12.5C and 15C and June 20C)\n\nTLDR:  1st and only Class 1 EV in the US with no competition. Has an amazing  team and management. Has an EV kitted factory ready for production by Q3  of this year in Indiana. Has 30,000 preorders already and expects  30-60k more by next year. NOT a Chinese company, will just be using  Sokon's already successful model and improving on it.",

        "selftext": "Hey Everyone - my background is in energy and earlier this week I came across two articles about Vistra that piqued my interest. First, one in which it was acknowledged that Vistra Energy has more generation than retail load and second, that Vistra Energy was able to keep 18gws of their 19gw fleet online for the duration of the Texas winter storm. Linked below are my calcs and model inputs/considerations.  \n\nIn a nutshell, analysis suggests that **Vista Energy generated approximately $5.19 Billion in revenue from  2/12/21 to 2/21/21**\n\nVistra was well-positioned for the winter freeze given their meticulous winter-storm preparedness and weatherization plans. There's even a paper trail suggesting so (links below). It begins with Vistra bringing units back from maintenance outages early specifically in anticipation of the storm. Note that it typically takes one to two weeks to being a unit back from a maintenance outage.  \n\nOnce the weather forecast worsened and their internal load forecasts deviated from ERCOT's forecast,  they sounded the alarm to ERCOT who shrugged them off. This was early enough that I believe, during this time, Vistra was able to hedge the rest of their retail book at favorable prices leading into the event, although my model suggests otherwise to provide a more conservative PnL estimate. \n\nDuring the storm, Vistra's market share of total generation  increased from 18% to 25-30% of all generation online. They have gone on the record indicating they were successful at consistently keeping their 18gw fleet online and producing electrons during the time period with no - or minimal - disruptions to natural gas supplies.\n\nAfter the storm, they donated $5M to Texas retail customers to help with high electricity bills - somewhat suspicious given others in the industry are losing billions of dollars, collectively. \n\nAfter listening to Vistra's testimony at the Texas Capitol today, I suspect they faired supremely well during this period and are simply trying to 'lay low' and minimize the storms impact on their bottom line so as to not attract unwanted attention from regulators and agitate state officials. \n\nPersonally, I do not expect Vistra to provide any material financial details into how they faired from the storm during tomorrow's earnings call, but certainly be on the look out for an incredible earnings 'surprise' 3 months from now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcel spreadsheet with detailed analysis and references/support (please excuse typos): \n\n[https://1drv.ms/x/s!AnCj\\_wHbX-wU-HMOvDIWwMqtBXOR?e=ooD7zW](https://1drv.ms/x/s!AnCj_wHbX-wU-HMOvDIWwMqtBXOR?e=ooD7zW)\n\nDisclaimer: I am long Vistra Energy.

        "selftext": "Hey Everyone - my background is in energy and earlier this week I came across two articles about Vistra that piqued my interest. First, one in which it was acknowledged that Vistra Energy has more generation than retail load and second, that Vistra Energy was able to keep 18gws of their 19gw fleet online for the duration of the Texas winter storm. Linked below are my calcs and model inputs/considerations.  \n\nIn a nutshell, my analysis suggests that **Vista Energy generated approximately $5.19 Billion in revenue from  2/12/21 to 2/21/21 alone! Here's why:**\n\nVistra was well-positioned for the winter freeze given their meticulous winter-storm preparedness and weatherization plans. There's even a paper trail suggesting so (links below). It begins with Vistra bringing units back from maintenance outages early specifically in anticipation of the storm. Note that it typically takes one to two weeks to being a unit back from a maintenance outage.  \n\nOnce the weather forecast worsened and their internal load forecasts deviated from ERCOT's forecast,  they sounded the alarm to ERCOT who shrugged them off. This was early enough that I believe, during this time, Vistra was able to hedge the rest of their retail book at favorable prices leading into the event, although my model suggests otherwise to provide a more conservative PnL estimate. \n\nDuring the storm, Vistra's market share of total generation  increased from 18% to 25-30% of all generation online. They have gone on the record indicating they were successful at consistently keeping their 18gw fleet online and producing electrons during the time period with no - or minimal - disruptions to natural gas supplies.\n\nAfter the storm, they donated $5M to Texas retail customers to help with high electricity bills - somewhat suspicious given others in the industry are losing billions of dollars, collectively. \n\nAfter listening to Vistra's testimony at the Texas Capitol today, I suspect they faired supremely well during this period and are simply trying to 'lay low' and minimize the storms impact on their bottom line so as to not attract unwanted attention from regulators and agitate state officials. \n\nPersonally, I do not expect Vistra to provide any material financial details into how they faired from the storm during tomorrow's earnings call, but certainly be on the look out for an incredible earnings 'surprise' 3 months from now.\n\nExcel spreadsheet with detailed analysis and references/support (please excuse typos): \n\n[https://1drv.ms/x/s!AnCj\\_wHbX-wU-HMOvDIWwMqtBXOR?e=ooD7zW](https://1drv.ms/x/s!AnCj_wHbX-wU-HMOvDIWwMqtBXOR?e=ooD7zW)\n\nDisclaimer: I am long Vistra Energy. I am not a financial advisor and this DD is based on my own personal opinion on Vistra's outlook and is not to be considered financial advice.",

        "selftext": "Hello  All, this is my first DD. It is long but I hope you will enjoy it. I  wanted to do an in-depth dive into the company Forum Merger 3 (FIII) ,  who is merging with Electric Last Mile Solutions, an EV company   specializing in last mile delivery and work vans. FIII will be the first   and only Class 1 electric vehicle on the market, coming as early as  Q3,  with no other Class 1 EV as competition. They are also bringing a  Class  2 EV truck to market next year. A key factor in allowing ELMS to  be  first to market in Class 1 is the fact that they are taking over the  old  Hummer plant in Indiana. Additionally, they have the luxury of  working  with an already successful EV company, allowing for instant  transposition of truck plans ready for production.\n\nFIII has intrigued me  from the get go being an EV company, yet it has  received little to no  attention which is reflected in the current stock  price. There has been  little to no movement on the stock other than  some sideways and  downwards action, which is atypical behavior for most  EV companies. So what  gives?\n\nAfter doing some digging, it appears that the main concern holding   back most investors back from committing to this great company is their   connection and relations to (((CHINA))), which comes by way of a   company in particular called Sokon Automotive.This concern is not   unwarranted, as ties to China have been an issue of concern in the   market lately. As investors, especially when dealing with new companies,   we want maximum transparency, which seems almost impossible any time   we're dealing with a Chinese company. However, as my research has shown,  the ELMS relationship with China is nothing to be concerned about. In   fact, it is quite the opposite \u2013 something that will help propel them   forward and accelerate their process through previously successfully   developed truck plans and numerous industry connections.\n\n# I.  The Team\n\nFirst,  let's take a look at who is behind the team. As we have come  to know, a  company is only as good as the team behind it. The team behind  ELMS is an   All-Star cast of players in the auto industry with years of  experience  and accomplishments.  After looking into each of the team  members, some  interesting connections emerged amongst them and amongst  different   auto/EV companies(including a connection to Tesla) . These  connections  made some of the pieces start to fall into place. In  particular, I  wanted to figure out more so their connection to the  Chinese players.  Was it sketchy and something to be concerned about?  After digging deeper  my questions were answered.\n\n\u200b\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***The Allstars*** ***-***\n\n**James (Jim) Taylor** \u2013 35+ years experience \u2013 CEO and Founder of ELMS, former executive at **Karma**. Former CEO of **Workhorse,**   he pivoted the company\u2019s focus from the electrification of cars and   SUVs to medium duty commercial trucks. Former CEO of SF Motors, now   known as Seres(owned by Sokon, the company they are working with).   Worked at **General Motors**, serving as President of **Cadillac** and CEO of **Hummer**.   Led the design and technology upgrading of the new model of Cadillac,   which contributed to the revival of the brand. This guy is the   powerhouse behind ELMS. James knows what it takes to build a company and   what it takes to pivot to the emerging world of  EVs. He probably has   some of the most experience of anyone in the industry when it comes to   EVs, having worked on both Karma (with Henrik Fisker of FSR) and   Workhorse which we all know. His innovation and experience on developing   different types of EVs, will allow for future design and build   improvements. Jim, also Canadian, is known as \u201cThe Great One\u201d when it   comes to the EV world. He is also known as Jim \u201cThe EV Man\u201d Taylor,   because like the show Home Improvement, he is always building and   innovating in the garage.\n\n**Jason Luo** \u2013 25+ years experience -  Executive Chairman and Co-Founder of ELMS. Former CEO of Key Safety Systems, **Ford** China and **Accuride**.    Jason served for nearly a decade as CEO of Key Safety Systems (now   Joyson Safety Systems), one of the largest automotive safety companies   in the world.  Oversaw the company\u2019s acquisition of Takata Corporation   for $1.6 billion. Jason currently serves on the board of directors of   Accuride, Elo Touch Solutions, ATC Drivetrain and Sybridge Technologies.    He has extensive experience in the automotive world and more   importantly with large companies. In addition he has been through a few   different mergers and acquisitions which is an added benefit. He knows   what it takes to come out on top.\n\n**Shauna McIntyre, -** 20+ years **-** CEO, Sense Photonics, Inc. (LiDAR) and Former program lead, **Google** automotive services, **Alphabet**,   Inc .  She previously led Google\u2019s automotive services program, during   which time she released Google products, including Google Maps, into   automakers\u2019 new vehicle models. Since 2019, she has served on the Board   of Directors of Lithia Motors, the world's 3rd largest auto dealer.   One  interesting piece of info I found is that she is the co-founder of a   group called **The North American Council for Freight Efficiency**   (NACFE). They focus specifically on turning the transportation  industry  into a more economical and EV friendly space. One video I  found on  their group website was called \u201cHigh-Potential Regions for  Electric  Truck Deployments\u201d. It talked about geographical areas they  want to  focus on and develop \u2013 one of them being the Great Lakes. Guess  where  the new ELMS factory will be? Right around the Great Lakes.   This group  puts out monthly newsletters and events , so she can use  this board as a  means to spread the word throughout the industry.  Interestingly enough,  this group just started running an EV truck demo  for data collection  and analytics, and two of the companies already  involved are  GIK(Lightning E-motors) and Workhorse.\n\n**Richard Peretz, -** 40+ years **-**  Former CFO, **United Parcel Service (UPS)**,    during which time he opened UPS operations in China. Richard also   helped expand the company\u2019s international  footprint in many European   and Asian countries. You can bet that this will help ELMS get some   international connections. Hes overseen numerous acquisitions, as well   as being a leading member of the team that managed UPS\u2019s IPO in 1999, at   the time the largest in U.S. history. He is no stranger to   understanding what it takes to make a new operation a successful one.\n\n**Brian Krzanich, -** 25+ years -  CEO, CDK Global (one of the biggest technologies for dealerships) and Former CEO, **Intel Corporation**.   Oversaw the acquisition of companies such as autonomous driving  company  Mobileye. This guy is a pimp daddy. He was forced to resign  from Intel  because he got caught having a relationship with an  employee. You could  say she really turned his software into hardware!  Brian currently serves  on the boards of AMS AG and Footprint US  (sustainable technology). He  previously served on the Boards of Deere  &amp; Company and Semiconductor  Industry Association, as well as  serving as the Chair of the FAA Drone  Advisory Committee. He is the go  to guy for the chips and computers for  the vehicles. This will help  with any autonomous driving they have  planned, as well as their on  board ELMS AIR system (more on this later).\n\n**Neil Goldberg**,  - 45+ yrs \u2013 Director of Forum,  Chairman and CEO, Raymour &amp;  Flannigan Furniture and Holdings. Many  years of retailing, merchandising  and general management experience.\n\n**David Boris \u2013**  30+ years - Co-CEO and CFO, Forum  Merger III Corporation. Has been  involved in approximately 20 merger transactions as a board member,  underwriter and M&amp;A advisor.    Director of Tattooed Chef, Inc.,  which completed its merger with Forum  Merger II Corporation in October  2020. TTCF has done suprisingly well,  despite it being one company that I  was not fond of due to my nutrition  background. I think the food itself  is over priced crap but it has held  steady in price ever since merger  completion. This bodes well for  FIII.\n\n\u200b\n\n***Other Members of the Team*** ***-***\n\n***Jerry Hu***  \u2013 25+ years - COO , Safety  expert, global operation leadership and Asia  head for Key Safety  Systems, commercial leadership and other management  at **Accuride** and **Volkswagen.**\n\n***Justin Prann*** \u2013 15+ years \u2013 CCO , National VP of Sales and Service for **Mahindra Automotive** North America (in the running for the USPS contract), senior positions within **BMW** North America.\n\n***Kev Adjemian*** **\u2013** 20+ years \u2013 CTO, Global Head of Battery Cells at **Fiat** **Chrysler** Automobiles and VP of Powertrain and EV Systems, including OTA, at **Karma**. Fuel cell, battery and electric powertrain R&amp;D leadership at **Nissan.**\n\n***Albert Li*** \u2013 20+ years - CFO of EV startup Byton(led by Carsten Breitfeld , the now ceo of Farraday Future), and **Ford** China, senior positions at Bombardier in charge of aerospace operations in China.\n\n***Benjamin Wu***  \u2013 15+ years \u2013 GC, Chief Legal  Officer and Administration    head for  Meridian, with extensive  experience in M&amp;A and international  corporate transactions for both  private and public companies.\n\nSo  as we can, see this team is ridiculously good and has excellent   connections that run deep, not only in the US , but in China, and other   places around the world. The fact that the Chinese companies that are   connected with the team include the likes of Ford and UPS, tell me that   there is a legitimacy to their business dealings. This team covers many   bases that are necessary for ELMS to be a top contender in the ev  world.  These players have tons of experience, have held top level  positions at  top tier companies, and have the knowledge and know-how in  many  different aspects of electric vehicles and the industry overall.\n\n# II. What Does ELMS Do?\n\nNow  that we know who ELMS is , lets take a look at what exactly they   do.ELMS offers the only Class 1 EV in an underserved commercial  delivery  industry.  Some of the advantages ELMS has over other EV  companies  include:\n\n\u25aaFirst and Only Class 1 .  The fact that they are a first mover is  absolutely HUGE for  establishing themselves and cashing in on the  opportunity of being alone  in the field.\n\n\u25aaFactory in Indiana already kitted out for EV production\n\n\u25aaCars ready by Q3 of this year. Most EV companies aren't on the road until 2022 and later\n\n\u25aaLowest total cost of ownership in Class 1\n\n\u25aaAlready proven successful product based off top selling 2020 EV model in China\n\nHere is a pretty chart comparing them to some competitors. Note \u2013 this is from December so it may have changed some since.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe  ELMS Urban Delivery van costs the same or cheaper as its  gasoline  counterparts ($32,500-7500 credit =$25k),  but has 35% more  cargo space ,  at 170 cubic ft, and a cheaper total cost of ownership by  35% (50%  compared to a class 2). The cost per year comes to around  $1550 for ELMS  Urban Delivery vs $4000 for a regular gas Class 1. It  becomes even  cheaper when you factor in the extra cargo volume per  cubic ft that it  provides.The 2022 Class 2/3 model will have 218ft. It  appears that they  have plans to make different variations of their  Class 1 and Class 3,  being able to turn them into Class 2s as well  based off individual  needs. They will have a range of 150 to 200 miles  and be capable of a  full recharge in as little as two hours. These  types of vans are used in  many capacities of our society. For example,  delivery and ecommerce  (Amazon, Fedex, DHL), communications (Verizon,  Comcast), small  businesses (local flower shop, food trucks), and  utility and local  municipality vehicles. There is no lack of demand for  these types of  vehicles.\n\nA cool feature that will  probably be a huge sales point for ELMS  that I think has been  overlooked, is that they will be upfitting the  vans themselves.  Upfitting is the process of taking the vehicle to a  specialist to be  equipped to meet the specific needs of that business.  This includes  things like installing custom drawers and cabinets,  shelving, lighting,  power supplies, etc. The typical upfitting process  involves a 3rd party  vendor or sometimes numerous different ones, and  takes on avg 130-140  days from order to delivery. The ELMS custom  upfitting process allows  for :\n\n\u25aa \\~25% reduction time from order to delivery\n\n\u25aa One warranty single point of contact for customer\n\n\u25aa  Total vehicle value chain cost reduced by 5+%ELMS are also  currently in  talks with the leading upfitter brands IVS, Adrian Steel,  and Auto  Truck Group.\n\nI have found no other EV that has said they will be doing something like this yet.\n\n\u200b\n\nNext,  the ELMS vehicles will be connected with a system called ELMS  AIR, an  over-the-air programming system. I have not been able to find  much  information about any specifics except for some clues in their  investor  presentation.  They will use these over-the-air data systems  in  partnership with the industry leading Geotab to provide many  benefits to  their customers. Some areas that will be serviced include :\n\n\u25aaProductivity - accurate arrival and departure times ,true trip miles\n\n\u25aaOptimization - increase energy efficiency, record powertrain diagnostics, vehicle maintenance\n\n\u25aaCompliance - electronic driver logs, tax reporting, vehicle inspection reports\n\n\u25aaExpandability - system integration, hardware add-ons &amp; software add-ins\n\nSome  of the obvious benefits of a type of system, like we see in  Tesla for  example, are the ability for the software updates to happen  frequently  and easily, along with data  constantly being in  communication with the  main servers. The more data that is able to be  collected, the better  optimized these services and vehicles can be. The  experience and  knowledge of BigPoppa Brian Krzanich from Intel will   be valuable in  this aspect. What we will end up seeing with a system  like this is more  and more areas of value for the companies buying it.  For example, there  will be savings from being able to easily collect  accurate tax data and  driving logs from the drivers. Time will also be  saved with something  such as the automated updates and knowing exactly  when a van will need  to be serviced or inspected. As time goes on and  more data becomes  collected, the ELMS AIR service will only prove to be  more valuable for  both the company and their customers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# III. Sales and Financials\n\nThe  FIII team has  $250 million in trust, and $155M PIPE in  connection with  the merger. ELMS will have a  $1.4billion enterprise  value at closing.  The ELMS team is expected to have $379 million of  cash to fund  operations and growth. They have said that no additional  capital  requirements are needed after close to achieve positive cash  flow.  With  their $379 million cash minus $150mill in debt, that gives  us $229  million in net cash to work with. There are a total of  142,500,000  shares. Current market cap at the share price of $12, gives  us $1.71  billion.\n\nELMS currently has 30,000  pre-orders for its delivery van,  representing a revenue of $1billion.  They expect another 30,000 to  60,000 orders by the middle of 2021. Some  of the companies they are in  talks with or have preorders from already,  include: Penske, Cox +  Siemens (cant make that up), Merchants,  Enterprise, IVS, and others.  These contracts will work directly with  companies such as Ikea, Best  Buy, Walmart, Fedex, Ryder and more. The  experience and connections of  the team will no doubt lead to more  contracts in the future.\n\nThe ELMS  business plan includes a conservative volume ramp, with  approximately  4,000 vehicles expected to be delivered by the fourth  quarter of 2021,  accelerating to approximately 19,000 deliveries in  2022, and  approximately 35,000 deliveries in 2023. \u201cOur team  collectively has  decades of experience launching vehicles for global  OEMs, and so while  the facility has an annual production capacity of  100,000 units, we are  deliberately conservative in our initial volumes  so that we can be  laser-focused on quality and, as a new brand,  establishing an excellent  reputation with our customers.\u201d\n\nI  have seen some grumblings about the fine print of the 30,000  preorders  being \u201ccontingent upon satisfaction of customer  requirements.\u201d As you  will see shortly, this is a successful and more  than satisfactory  vehicle and has been proven to be so based off its  Chinese sales all  year. I have zero doubt that this team will give the  customers  everything they want and then some. If anything, I would  expect the ELMS  vehicles be even better than their Sokon counterpart.\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*Put on your tinfoil hat and sunglasses and follow me real quick\\*\\*\\***\\*\n\n*THEORY #1*: ELMS will receive a future contract due to its relation to the new **Secretary of  Transportation, Pete Buttigieg**.   Before his run for president last year, good ole Petey boy was the   mayor of South Bend, Indiana. He has been known to have very mixed   results there in terms of popularity, but he did put an emphasis on   creating more jobs and projects to rebuild the area. Guess where the new   ELMS factory is located? Yup, literally right next to South Bend in  the  bordering town of Mishikawa. Could it be possible that ELMS will  have  first priority now for any new government contracts relating to EV  delivery or services, or maybe additional funding/credits? Quite possibly. We all know of Biden's plan to electrify the US, and now Mayor  Pete has a perfect opportunity to give back to his hometown and bring   more jobs and prosperity to South Bend and the surrounding areas. And as a matter of fact, Pete Buttigieg  actually held a campaign rally at the ELMS(Hummer) factory last year. This means ELMS are 100% on his  radar.\n\n*THEORY #2*:  This picture right here was mentioned in the  investor presentation when  they were giving examples of how their  trucks will be used for  municipalities. At first glance I thought  nothing of it and said hey  just some random counties they have worked  with. The Michigan and  Indiana seals make sense since that's where they  are located. And the  California ones also since that's where most of  the former employees and  Seres motors was headquartered. But then I  noticed the top left seal,  from Fairfax, Virginia. This just so happens  to be right next to my  hometown so I am very familiar with this area.  Why does the Fairfax, VA  seal appear alongside those of Michigan,  Indiana, and California?  A  side note about Fairfax County \u2013 it is very  wealthy and very liberal.  Turns out they have quite a few Green  Initiatives in action. Last year  they stated that \u201cOne-hundred percent  of eligible county vehicles  scheduled for purchase in fiscal year 2021  shall be replaced with  electric vehicles and the infrastructure needed  can be supported in  fiscal year 2021.\u201d  Just a few weeks ago another  article stated \u201cFairfax  County Public Schools is getting its first  electric school bus today as  part of a statewide initiative led by  Dominion Energy.\u201d Interesting! It  seems quite obvious Fairfax County is  gearing up for wide scale EV  adoption, and wants to do implement it as  soon as possible. Maryland and  D.C. rank 8th and 9th for highest rate  of EV adoption, while Virginia  ranks 23rd. You can be damn sure they  will be looking to improve on that  number.\n\n\u200b\n\nSpeaking of government contracts, ELMS has **ALREADY**   received funding from the state of Indiana.  In late December, the   Indiana Economic Development Corporation (IEDC), which leads the state\u2019s   economic development efforts,  offered ELMS a series of conditional  tax  credits and training grants based on its plans to create new jobs  in  its factory. The IEDC offered up to **$10 million** in conditional tax credits and up to **$200,000** in conditional training grants based on the company\u2019s job creation plans. The IEDC also offered up to **$2.8 million**   in conditional tax credits from the Hoosier Business Investment (HBI)   tax credit program based on the company\u2019s planned capital investment in   Indiana. This may not be that much money-wise, but it is an excellent   start to pave the way for future endeavors.\n\nAnother  huge benefit for ELMS is that they have a fraction of the  typical  startup cost for EV production. The typical cost for entry into  the N.A.  market is around  $1.6 billion. With the help of the already  successful  Sokon, which provided about $570 million of investments  already, ELMS  only needs to contribute around $160 million. This gives  them much more  wiggle room to grow and try new things.If we compare  ELMS money  situation versus other EV competitors, \u201cRivian\u2019s becoming  the poster  child, smoking through $2 billion, $3 billion,\u201d Taylor said.  \u201cIf you  think $200 million to $300 million for product engineering,  ours is $80  million, That\u2019s really just airbags, seat belts and  adapting to \\[U.S.  safety requirements\\]. Tooling is already in place  because SERES spent  $20 million for the canceled SUV plans. Earlier  post-Hummer occupants  also left some usable equipment behind. \u201cComing  off the existing  platform is worth hundreds of millions,\u201d Taylor said.  \u201cSupplier tooling  alone would normally be a couple hundred million.\u201d  Well, that's a  bargain.\n\nThe institutional ownership of FIII has been climbing recently. There has  been multiple funds purchasing within the last week:\n\n\u25aaAlpine  Global Management, bought 2,135,286 shares (valued around   $25.6million), equaling 8.3% of FIII. One of the biggest purchases so   far.\n\n\u25aaBNP Paribas Asset Management UK - 1,665,354 shares (\\~$20million) \u25aaPhoenix Holdings Ltd \u2013 1,103,741 shares (\\~$12million)\n\n\u25aaBank of America \u2013 70k shares (\\~$1mill)\n\n\u25aaToronto Dominion Bank \u2013 15k shares (\\~$203k)\n\n\u25aaSTA Wealth Management \u2013 13k shares (\\~$176k)\n\n\u25aaUBS Group \u2013 Increased holdings by 90% to 14,418 shares (\\~$200k)\n\nWe also have in the past month:\n\n\u25aaPolar Asset Management Partners Inc. bought a stake worth $10,935,000.\n\n\u25aaP Schoenfeld Asset Management LP bought a stake worth $5,964,000.\n\n\u25aaGabelli &amp; Co Investment Adviers bought a stake worth $1,772,000.\n\n\u25aaJefferies Group LLC bought a stake worth $1,305,000.\n\nI  have not seen an official number but the closest figure I can find  for  total institutional ownership is around 25-30% . I would imagine  this  will get larger once there is an official merger date.\n\nAs  investors, we would like to see alternative revenue streams to  help the  company grow. ELMS has plans for a few different ways to  increase their  business. One of the main ways is that they will produce  their vans for  the entire North American market (CA and Mexico),  Europe, and China.  Just from the Chinese sales alone, ELMS is  estimating a potential upside  of $300 million. The other major way ELMS  will increase revenue is  through the monitization of their ELMS AIR  data. They will gather and  mine all the data and services from their  vehicles and then use this to  provide valuable information that other  companies will want to buy. They  will also use this data to optimize  and reduce fleet insurance costs.   This data has an estimated upside of  around $50-100 million in increased  revenue. As volume and sales also  increase, they will introduce  passenger van models, as well as rental  or subscription based services.\n\nSome key takeaways from the ELMS financial situation :\n\n\u25aaNo additional capital expected to be required after merger close to fund initial product launches\n\n\u25aaProjected to be Cash Flow Positive by Q42022\n\n\u25aaEstimated 83,000 Units by 2025, representing \\~5% of U.S. Market\n\n\u25aaRevenue projected to reach $3 Billion and EBITDA estimated at $791 Million by end of 2025\n\n# IV. The Indiana Factory\n\n\u200b\n\nAnother **MASSIVE**  way that ELMS will save a boatload  of cash, and speed up the production  of their van, is through the  former Hummer plant that they will be  taking over in Mishawaka,  Indiana. This plant was originally used for GM  and Hummer, and then  once they folded it got taken over by James Taylor  and his former  company, Seres.  This plant has the capacity to assemble  100,000  vehicles annually, something that ELMS will most likely need to  do by  next year. The Indiana Office of Economic Development Executive   Director Bill Schalliol says \u201cELMS has worked out a deal with the United   Autoworkers Union, which has represented workers at this plant in   recent years. ELMS will initially launch with 140 workers, increasing   staffing to 450 workers when it reaches full production on one line of   smaller vans. Within four years, the company could have 960 employees if   it produces a second assembly line, manufacturing larger sized  delivery  vans.\u201d The Mishawaka plant was selected because it has been  retrofitted  already for electric vehicle production, and has a strong  supply chain  and experienced workforce available. Seres had already put  **$130 million** into building this plant for EV use. How nice of them.\n\nAnother  bonus that will help with the quality and speed of  production \u2013 workers  who are already familiar with the plant and  assembly line. The land  itself is not fully used yet either, and can be  used as a future site  for in house manufacturing of parts.\n\nIn  addition to this plant, as of January, a new global headquarters  with  31,000 square feet of space and capacity for nearly 200 employees  has  been built in Troy, Michigan. The global headquarters strategically   positions ELMS in the center of a network of suppliers and partners  and  provides access to one of the world\u2019s best automotive talent pools.  The  state-of-the-art facility includes an over 15,000 square feet  prototype  lab, where ELMS plans to assemble initial battery pack and  electric  motor prototypes as well as complete pre-production vehicle  builds. ELMS  also plans to utilize the facility as a customer center  where it can  work with customers to understand their vehicle  specifications and  analytics needs, as well as conduct test drives.    \u201cIn addition to  facilitating our growth, the design of our new global  headquarters will  allow for collaboration across all aspects of our  engineering \u2013 from  vehicle design, prototyping and software development  \u2013 and customer  engagement, enabling ELMS to deliver for its customers  the most  efficient and customized solutions for their last mile use  cases,\u201d said  James Taylor.\n\nELMS plans to open  additional offices in California and other  locations in proximity to  major EV talent and development hubs\u201cELMS  plans to build around 4,100  vans by the end of 2021, more than double  output to 9,100 vehicles in  2022 when the second vehicle is added, and  grow to 83,000 for both by  2025. The vehicle and plant are said to be **90% Ready for U.S. Production**.\u201d\n\nDid you read that? **90% READY** !  What other EV early starter is at this level? Very few, if any at all.\n\n# V. Sokon Auto and ELMS Connection\n\nOk,  sounds good you say. But what's the deal with this Chinese  company that  we've never heard of? Sokon..sokon my what?! Oh that  Sokon. Yes,  officially called Dongfeng Sokon, known internationally as  DFSK. They  have been around since 2003, and are well established in the  Chinese  auto world. They are one of the top 3 manufacturers, actually.  Sokon has  a proven product and demand.  They have over 200,000 gas  models, plus  30,000+ EVs sold in Asia. That equates to over 1 million  miles driven a  day just off their EVs alone. On top of that, they were  the **TOP SELLING EV MODEL in 1H 2020**  in all of China.  Again, Sokon is no no-name company. It has a large  customer base for  their EV fleet, and these are some legitimate  companies that even me  and you can recognize. This includes ecommerce  delivery for JD.com and  Ali Baba, postal service for the China Post,  utilities for the state  grid, and shuttles for the Hong Kong  International Airport.\n\n**Ok, so I guess this isn't some shady random backroom Chinese vaporware  company. So how are they involved with ELMS?**\n\nThis  takes us back to Seres, formally known as SF Motors, the  company our  very own Jim 'the EV Man' Taylor was CEO of in 2019. Seres  was created  in 2016 and ended up being bought and owned by Sokon. An  interesting  side; note, one of the early members of Seres was the  cofounder and  former CEO of Tesla, Martin Eberhard. Guess where Martin  worked before  this? A little company called Atieva, now known as Lucid  Motors!\n\nOne thing I  want to talk about briefly, as well, is something I have  seen mentioned  regarding \u201cbad reviews\u201d from employees online about  Seres (Glassdoor I  believe). This has been cited as a reason for  concern and uncertainty in  regards to how the leadership behind ELMS  will function. As shown  earlier, the team and leaders we have here will  be the least of our  worries when it comes to whipping a formidable  team and workforce  together. Jim only started working around May, and  Seres had already  been bleeding cash and laying off workers. The  combination of increasing  tensions with China and the hardships of  trying into expand in multiple  countries at once, caused the eventual  dissolution of Seres in the US.   I have wondered also if most of these  reviews were due to turmoil going  on between specific people in the  company, such as Martin Eberhard and  other CEOs. He did get into it  with meme lord Elon and that ended up  leading to his ousting at Tesla.  At Seres, he also ended up leaving them  in less than a year and he took  people along with him to another EV  startup. Doesn't sound like much  of a team player.\n\nSeres  ended up ceasing their US operations, but has continued to  survive  overseas and has successful models in the Dutch market. They  will be  producing a Seres 5 and Seres 7 this year. It doesn't look too  bad to be  honest - kind of like a Porsche Cayenne.\n\n**Now that we know who Sokon is, and have alleviated the concern of them being an unknown entity, what can they do for ELMS?**\n\nWell,  they will get many benefits from this partnership. They get  the  existing EV product portfolio of Sokon, greatly decreasing the time  and  R+D needed to get off the ground. As mentioned before, there is  already a  demand and proven product with these models. No guess work  needed. On  top of that, they get the customer field experience and  warranty data  from the millions of miles already driven in these cars.  This will give  ELMS a huge head start to develop and improve many  aspects of their  automated systems and ELMS AIR. The high volume of  existing supplier  based contracts will be used to their advantage as  well. There will be  absolutely no lack of connections or reach that  this allstar team won't  be able to tap into. And then of course, the  amount of money saved from  the Mishawaka plant and already invested  Sokon development, is well over  half a billion dollars. Nice.\n\n# VI. Is This A Chinese Company?\n\nThe  last thing I want to mention in relation to China and ELMS, is  the  important question of: \u201cIs this a Chinese company or not?\u201d\n\n**The short and easy answer is NO.**\n\n**ELMS is an Independent U.S. Entity**\n\n**They will provide Made-In-USA EVs.**\n\nSokon  will provide the body production parts for ELMS, and CATL  (Tesla  supplier) will provide the batteries. They will use domestic  supply for  the EV powertrain. The inverter and the chassis skateboard  design for  the batteries will be sourced in the U.S. Unfortunately,  ELMS cannot go  fully domestic yet, but is hoping to transition as much  as possible in  the future. Right now, they are also focused on making  sure they can get  an attractive and affordable price point to its  customers. \u201cHey, made  in America. Made in Mishawaka. Half of it\u2019s  American,\u201d he said. \u201cOur  engineers are here. The software guys. The  homologation is all based in  Auburn Hills \\[Michigan\\]. We plan to source  the majority of our EV  systems and componentry here in the U.S.    \u201cYou\u2019ll be going into the  FedExes, Walmarts, all these guys. I\u2019d say  there\u2019s a low chance to sell  them a Chinese truck,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cBut  after we\u2019re finished, it should  be looked at as just a few parts from  China. If we move all the way  into vertical integration, we\u2019re like  everybody else. I\u2019m not sure we  can hang onto that price point.\u201d  So as  we can see, there is some  strategy here at play in order to secure  some of these early and first  mover advantage contracts.\n\n# VII. Technical Analysis\n\nHad  to delete this because reached max character limit. Pretty much  nothing  overly bearish or bullish. FIII broke below resistance the past  2 days  of the 55 EMA, so this week we will look for it to rise above  it and  turn it from resistance back into support.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# VIII. Conclusion\n\nIf  you made it this far, congratulations. This was a journey to  China and  back. I hope from reading this, you, like me, have become  much more  confident and aware of the future potential of this amazing  new company  called Electric Last Mile Solutions.  I came into this  looking to  alleviate some of my worries about the stagnant and  seemingly void or  negative energy surrounding this company. I came out  the other end a  changed man. They say money doesn't grow on trees, but  they missed one.  The ELMS tree. And it has acorns for all of us.\n\nCome, watch this tree grow with me, friend.\n\nDisclosure: 10,000 warrants, 850 commons \n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial adviser, this is not financial advice.

Will be accumulating March 12.5C and 15C and June 20C\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR:  1st and only Class 1 EV in the US with no competition. Has an  amazing  team and management. Has an EV kitted factory ready for  production by Q3  of this year in Indiana. Has 30,000 preorders already  and expects  30-60k more by next year. NOT a Chinese company, will just  be using  Sokon's already successful model and improving on it.",

        "selftext": "Hello  All, this is my first DD. It is long but I hope you will enjoy it. I   wanted to do an in-depth dive into the company Forum Merger 3 (FIII) ,   who is merging with Electric Last Mile Solutions, an EV company   specializing in last mile delivery and work vans. FIII will be the first   and only Class 1 electric vehicle on the market, coming as early as  Q3,  with no other Class 1 EV as competition. They are also bringing a  Class  2 EV truck to market next year. A key factor in allowing ELMS to  be  first to market in Class 1 is the fact that they are taking over the  old  Hummer plant in Indiana. Additionally, they have the luxury of  working  with an already successful EV company, allowing for instant   transposition of truck plans ready for production.\n\nFIII has intrigued me  from the get go being an EV SPAC, yet it has  received little to no  attention which is reflected in the current stock  price. There has been  little to no movement on the stock other than  some sideways and  downwards action, which is atypical behavior for most  EV SPACs. So what  gives?\n\nAfter doing some digging, it appears that the main concern holding   back most investors back from committing to this great company is their   connection and relations to (((CHINA))), which comes by way of a   company in particular called Sokon Automotive.This concern is not   unwarranted, as ties to China have been an issue of concern in the   market lately. As investors, especially when dealing with new companies,   we want maximum transparency, which seems almost impossible any time   we're dealing with a Chinese company. However, as my research has shown,   the ELMS relationship with China is nothing to be concerned about. In   fact, it is quite the opposite \u2013 something that will help propel them   forward and accelerate their process through previously successfully   developed truck plans and numerous industry connections.\n\n# I.  The Team\n\nFirst,  let's take a look at who is behind the team. As we have come  to know, a  SPAC is only as good as the team behind it. The team behind  ELMS is an   All-Star cast of players in the auto industry with years of  experience  and accomplishments.  After looking into each of the team  members, some  interesting connections emerged amongst them and amongst  different   auto/EV companies(including a connection to Tesla) . These  connections  made some of the pieces start to fall into place. In  particular, I  wanted to figure out more so their connection to the  Chinese players.  Was it sketchy and something to be concerned about?  After digging deeper  my questions were answered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The AllStars](https://preview.redd.it/54vhxflk4ph61.png?width=989&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e2263d0d4f7c3c116941204b78748f820e4c763)\n\n***The Allstars*** ***-***\n\n**James (Jim) Taylor** \u2013 35+ years experience \u2013 CEO and Founder of ELMS, former executive at **Karma**. Former CEO of **Workhorse,**   he pivoted the company\u2019s focus from the electrification of cars and   SUVs to medium duty commercial trucks. Former CEO of SF Motors, now   known as Seres(owned by Sokon, the company they are working with).   Worked at **General Motors**, serving as President of **Cadillac** and CEO of **Hummer**.   Led the design and technology upgrading of the new model of Cadillac,   which contributed to the revival of the brand. This guy is the   powerhouse behind ELMS. James knows what it takes to build a company and   what it takes to pivot to the emerging world of  EVs. He probably has   some of the most experience of anyone in the industry when it comes to   EVs, having worked on both Karma (with Henrik Fisker of FSR) and   Workhorse which we all know. His innovation and experience on developing   different types of EVs, will allow for future design and build   improvements. Jim, also Canadian, is known as \u201cThe Great One\u201d when it   comes to the EV world. He is also known as Jim \u201cThe EV Man\u201d Taylor,   because like the show Home Improvement, he is always building and   innovating in the garage.\n\n**Jason Luo** \u2013 25+ years experience -  Executive Chairman and Co-Founder of ELMS. Former CEO of Key Safety Systems, **Ford** China and **Accuride**.    Jason served for nearly a decade as CEO of Key Safety Systems (now   Joyson Safety Systems), one of the largest automotive safety companies   in the world.  Oversaw the company\u2019s acquisition of Takata Corporation   for $1.6 billion. Jason currently serves on the board of directors of   Accuride, Elo Touch Solutions, ATC Drivetrain and Sybridge Technologies.    He has extensive experience in the automotive world and more   importantly with large companies. In addition he has been through a few   different mergers and acquisitions which is an added benefit. He knows   what it takes to come out on top.\n\n**Shauna McIntyre, -** 20+ years **-** CEO, Sense Photonics, Inc. (LiDAR) and Former program lead, **Google** automotive services, **Alphabet**,   Inc .  She previously led Google\u2019s automotive services program, during   which time she released Google products, including Google Maps, into   automakers\u2019 new vehicle models. Since 2019, she has served on the Board   of Directors of Lithia Motors, the world's 3rd largest auto dealer.   One  interesting piece of info I found is that she is the co-founder of a   group called **The North American Council for Freight Efficiency**   (NACFE). They focus specifically on turning the transportation  industry  into a more economical and EV friendly space. One video I  found on  their group website was called \u201cHigh-Potential Regions for  Electric  Truck Deployments\u201d. It talked about geographical areas they  want to  focus on and develop \u2013 one of them being the Great Lakes. Guess  where  the new ELMS factory will be? Right around the Great Lakes.   This group  puts out monthly newsletters and events , so she can use  this board as a  means to spread the word throughout the industry.  Interestingly enough,  this group just started running an EV truck demo  for data collection  and analytics, and two of the companies already  involved are  GIK(Lightning E-motors) and Workhorse.\n\n**Richard Peretz, -** 40+ years **-**  Former CFO, **United Parcel Service (UPS)**,    during which time he opened UPS operations in China. Richard also   helped expand the company\u2019s international  footprint in many European   and Asian countries. You can bet that this will help ELMS get some   international connections. Hes overseen numerous acquisitions, as well   as being a leading member of the team that managed UPS\u2019s IPO in 1999, at   the time the largest in U.S. history. He is no stranger to   understanding what it takes to make a new operation a successful one.\n\n**Brian Krzanich, -** 25+ years -  CEO, CDK Global (one of the biggest technologies for dealerships) and Former CEO, **Intel Corporation**.   Oversaw the acquisition of companies such as autonomous driving  company  Mobileye. This guy is a pimp daddy. He was forced to resign  from Intel  because he got caught having a relationship with an  employee. You could  say she really turned his software into hardware!  Brian currently serves  on the boards of AMS AG and Footprint US  (sustainable technology). He  previously served on the Boards of Deere  &amp; Company and Semiconductor  Industry Association, as well as  serving as the Chair of the FAA Drone  Advisory Committee. He is the go  to guy for the chips and computers for  the vehicles. This will help  with any autonomous driving they have  planned, as well as their on  board ELMS AIR system (more on this later).\n\n**Neil Goldberg**,  - 45+ yrs \u2013 Director of Forum,  Chairman and CEO, Raymour &amp;  Flannigan Furniture and Holdings. Many  years of retailing, merchandising  and general management experience.\n\n**David Boris \u2013**  30+ years - Co-CEO and CFO, Forum  Merger III Corporation. Has been  involved in approximately 20 SPAC  transactions as a board member,  underwriter and M&amp;A advisor.    Director of Tattooed Chef, Inc.,  which completed its merger with Forum  Merger II Corporation in October  2020. TTCF has done suprisingly well,  despite it being one SPAC that I  was not fond of due to my nutrition  background. I think the food itself  is over priced crap but it has held  steady in price ever since merger  completion. This bodes well for  FIII.\n\n\u200b\n\n*Processing img g7jukrvl4ph61...*\n\n***Other Members of the Team*** ***-***\n\n***Jerry Hu***  \u2013 25+ years - COO , Safety  expert, global operation leadership and Asia  head for Key Safety  Systems, commercial leadership and other management  at **Accuride** and **Volkswagen.**\n\n***Justin Prann*** \u2013 15+ years \u2013 CCO , National VP of Sales and Service for **Mahindra Automotive** North America (in the running for the USPS contract), senior positions within **BMW** North America.\n\n***Kev Adjemian*** **\u2013** 20+ years \u2013 CTO, Global Head of Battery Cells at **Fiat** **Chrysler** Automobiles and VP of Powertrain and EV Systems, including OTA, at **Karma**.

The fact that the Chinese companies that are   connected with the team include the likes of Ford and UPS, tell me that   there is a legitimacy to their business dealings. This team covers many   bases that are necessary for ELMS to be a top contender in the ev  world.  These players have tons of experience, have held top level  positions at  top tier companies, and have the knowledge and know-how in  many  different aspects of electric vehicles and the industry overall.\n\n# II. What Does ELMS Do?\n\nNow  that we know who ELMS is , lets take a look at what exactly they   do.ELMS offers the only Class 1 EV in an underserved commercial  delivery  industry.  Some of the advantages ELMS has over other EV  companies  include:\n\n\u25aaFirst and Only Class 1 .  The fact that they are a first mover is  absolutely HUGE for  establishing themselves and cashing in on the  opportunity of being alone  in the field.\n\n\u25aaFactory in Indiana already kitted out for EV production\n\n\u25aaCars ready by Q3 of this year. Most EV SPACs aren't on the road until 2022 and later\n\n\u25aaLowest total cost of ownership in Class 1\n\n\u25aaAlready proven successful product based off top selling 2020 EV model in China\n\nHere is a pretty chart comparing them to some competitors. Note \u2013 this is from December so it may have changed some since.\n\n\u200b\n\n[Only Class 1 - no other competition](https://preview.redd.it/qunxrcpm4ph61.png?width=1719&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82afea28956c20b131b2818a47689e32c050aca2)\n\nThe  ELMS Urban Delivery van costs the same or cheaper as its  gasoline  counterparts ($32,500-7500 credit =$25k),  but has 35% more  cargo space ,  at 170 cubic ft, and a cheaper total cost of ownership by  35% (50%  compared to a class 2). The cost per year comes to around  $1550 for ELMS  Urban Delivery vs $4000 for a regular gas Class 1. It  becomes even  cheaper when you factor in the extra cargo volume per  cubic ft that it  provides.The 2022 Class 2/3 model will have 218ft. It  appears that they  have plans to make different variations of their  Class 1 and Class 3,  being able to turn them into Class 2s as well  based off individual  needs. They will have a range of 150 to 200 miles  and be capable of a  full recharge in as little as two hours. These  types of vans are used in  many capacities of our society. For example,  delivery and ecommerce  (Amazon, Fedex, DHL), communications (Verizon,  Comcast), small  businesses (local flower shop, food trucks), and  utility and local  municipality vehicles. There is no lack of demand for  these types of  vehicles.\n\nA cool feature that will  probably be a huge sales point for ELMS  that I think has been  overlooked, is that they will be upfitting the  vans themselves.  Upfitting is the process of taking the vehicle to a  specialist to be  equipped to meet the specific needs of that business.  This includes  things like installing custom drawers and cabinets,  shelving, lighting,  power supplies, etc. The typical upfitting process  involves a 3rd party  vendor or sometimes numerous different ones, and  takes on avg 130-140  days from order to delivery. The ELMS custom  upfitting process allows  for :\n\n\u25aa \\~25% reduction time from order to delivery\n\n\u25aa One warranty single point of contact for customer\n\n\u25aa  Total vehicle value chain cost reduced by 5+%ELMS are also  currently in  talks with the leading upfitter brands IVS, Adrian Steel,  and Auto  Truck Group.\n\nI have found no other EV that has said they will be doing something like this yet.\n\n\u200b\n\n*Processing img j0g83din4ph61...*\n\nNext,  the ELMS vehicles will be connected with a system called ELMS  AIR, an  over-the-air programming system. I have not been able to find  much  information about any specifics except for some clues in their  investor  presentation.  They will use these over-the-air data systems  in  partnership with the industry leading Geotab to provide many  benefits to  their customers. Some areas that will be serviced include :\n\n\u25aaProductivity - accurate arrival and departure times ,true trip miles\n\n\u25aaOptimization - increase energy efficiency, record powertrain diagnostics, vehicle maintenance\n\n\u25aaCompliance - electronic driver logs, tax reporting, vehicle inspection reports\n\n\u25aaExpandability - system integration, hardware add-ons &amp; software add-ins\n\nSome  of the obvious benefits of a type of system, like we see in  Tesla for  example, are the ability for the software updates to happen  frequently  and easily, along with data  constantly being in  communication with the  main servers. The more data that is able to be  collected, the better  optimized these services and vehicles can be. The  experience and  knowledge of BigPoppa Brian Krzanich from Intel will   be valuable in  this aspect. What we will end up seeing with a system  like this is more  and more areas of value for the companies buying it.  For example, there  will be savings from being able to easily collect  accurate tax data and  driving logs from the drivers. Time will also be  saved with something  such as the automated updates and knowing exactly  when a van will need  to be serviced or inspected. As time goes on and  more data becomes  collected, the ELMS AIR service will only prove to be  more valuable for  both the company and their customers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img xzys0rmo4ph61...*\n\n# III. Sales and Financials\n\nThe  FIII team has  $250 million in trust, and $155M PIPE in  connection with  the merger. ELMS will have a  $1.4billion enterprise  value at closing.  The ELMS team is expected to have $379 million of  cash to fund  operations and growth. They have said that no additional  capital  requirements are needed after close to achieve positive cash  flow.  With  their $379 million cash minus $150mill in debt, that gives  us $229  million in net cash to work with. There are a total of  142,500,000  shares. Current market cap at the share price of $12, gives  us $1.71  billion.\n\nELMS currently has 30,000  pre-orders for its delivery van,  representing a revenue of $1billion.  They expect another 30,000 to  60,000 orders by the middle of 2021. Some  of the companies they are in  talks with or have preorders from already,  include: Penske, Cox +  Siemens (cant make that up), Merchants,  Enterprise, IVS, and others.  These contracts will work directly with  companies such as Ikea, Best  Buy, Walmart, Fedex, Ryder and more. The  experience and connections of  the team will no doubt lead to more  contracts in the future.\n\nThe ELMS  business plan includes a conservative volume ramp, with  approximately  4,000 vehicles expected to be delivered by the fourth  quarter of 2021,  accelerating to approximately 19,000 deliveries in  2022, and  approximately 35,000 deliveries in 2023. \u201cOur team  collectively has  decades of experience launching vehicles for global  OEMs, and so while  the facility has an annual production capacity of  100,000 units, we are  deliberately conservative in our initial volumes  so that we can be  laser-focused on quality and, as a new brand,  establishing an excellent  reputation with our customers.\u201d\n\nI  have seen some grumblings about the fine print of the 30,000  preorders  being \u201ccontingent upon satisfaction of customer  requirements.\u201d As you  will see shortly, this is a successful and more  than satisfactory  vehicle and has been proven to be so based off its  Chinese sales all  year. I have zero doubt that this team will give the  customers  everything they want and then some. If anything, I would  expect the ELMS  vehicles be even better than their Sokon counterpart.\n\n\u200b\n\n*Processing img 88qdcsfp4ph61...*\n\n\u200b\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*Put on your tinfoil hat and sunglasses and follow me real quick\\*\\*\\*\\\\**\\*\n\n*THEORY #1*: ELMS will receive a future contract due to its relation to the new **Secretary of  Transportation, Pete Buttigieg**.   Before his run for president last year, good ole Petey boy was the   mayor of South Bend, Indiana. He has been known to have very mixed   results there in terms of popularity, but he did put an emphasis on   creating more jobs and projects to rebuild the area. Guess where the new   ELMS factory is located? Yup, literally right next to South Bend in  the  bordering town of Mishikawa. Could it be possible that ELMS will  have  first priority now for any new government contracts relating to EV   delivery or services, or maybe additional funding/credits? Quite   possibly. We all know of Biden's plan to electrify the US, and now Mayor   Pete has a perfect opportunity to give back to his hometown and bring   more jobs and prosperity to South Bend and the surrounding areas.\n\nEDIT - Thanks to UkuleleJoe for pointing this out -  Pete Buttegieg  actually held a campaign rally at the ELMS(Hummer) factory when he was a  presidential candidate last year. This means ELMS are 100% on his  radar.\n\n*THEORY #2*:  This picture right here was mentioned in the  investor presentation when  they were giving examples of how their  trucks will be used for  municipalities. At first glance I thought  nothing of it and said hey  just some random counties they have worked  with. The Michigan and  Indiana seals make sense since that's where they  are located. And the  California ones also since that's where most of  the former employees and  Seres motors was headquartered. But then I  noticed the top left seal,  from Fairfax, Virginia. This just so happens  to be right next to my  hometown so I am very familiar with this area.  Why does the Fairfax, VA  seal appear alongside those of Michigan,  Indiana, and California?  A  side note about Fairfax County \u2013 it is very  wealthy and very liberal.  Turns out they have quite a few Green  Initiatives in action. Last year  they stated that \u201cOne-hundred percent  of eligible county vehicles  scheduled for purchase in fiscal year 2021  shall be replaced with  electric vehicles and the infrastructure needed  can be supported in  fiscal year 2021.\u201d  Just a few weeks ago another  article stated \u201cFairfax  County Public Schools is getting its first  electric school bus today as  part of a statewide initiative led by  Dominion Energy.\u201d Interesting! It  seems quite obvious Fairfax County is  gearing up for wide scale EV  adoption, and wants to do implement it as  soon as possible. Maryland and  D.C. rank 8th and 9th for highest rate  of EV adoption, while Virginia  ranks 23rd. You can be damn sure they  will be looking to improve on that  number.\n\n\u200b\n\n[Peculiar  section of their investors presentation which shows Fairfax County, VA   in the top left. Could these be potential county contracts they are  working on?](https://preview.redd.it/iahml2dq4ph61.png?width=610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40458e819d9b65b6d57efa102685f4f35892a49d)\n\nSpeaking of government contracts, ELMS has **ALREADY**   received funding from the state of Indiana.  In late December, the   Indiana Economic Development Corporation (IEDC), which leads the state\u2019s   economic development efforts,  offered ELMS a series of conditional  tax  credits and training grants based on its plans to create new jobs  in  its factory. The IEDC offered up to **$10 million** in conditional tax credits and up to **$200,000** in conditional training grants based on the company\u2019s job creation plans. The IEDC also offered up to **$2.8 million**   in conditional tax credits from the Hoosier Business Investment (HBI)   tax credit program based on the company\u2019s planned capital investment in   Indiana. This may not be that much money-wise, but it is an excellent   start to pave the way for future endeavors.\n\nAnother  huge benefit for ELMS is that they have a fraction of the  typical  startup cost for EV production. The typical cost for entry into  the N.A.  market is around  $1.6 billion. With the help of the already  successful  Sokon, which provided about $570 million of investments  already, ELMS  only needs to contribute around $160 million. This gives  them much more  wiggle room to grow and try new things.If we compare  ELMS money  situation versus other EV competitors, \u201cRivian\u2019s becoming  the poster  child, smoking through $2 billion, $3 billion,\u201d Taylor said.  \u201cIf you  think $200 million to $300 million for product engineering,  ours is $80  million, That\u2019s really just airbags, seat belts and  adapting to \\[U.S.  safety requirements\\]. Tooling is already in place  because SERES spent  $20 million for the canceled SUV plans. Earlier  post-Hummer occupants  also left some usable equipment behind. \u201cComing  off the existing  platform is worth hundreds of millions,\u201d Taylor said.  \u201cSupplier tooling  alone would normally be a couple hundred million.\u201d  Well, that's a  bargain.\n\nThe institutional ownership of FIII has been climbing recently. There has  been multiple funds purchasing within the last week:\n\n\u25aaAlpine  Global Management, bought 2,135,286 shares (valued around   $25.6million), equaling 8.3% of FIII. One of the biggest purchases so   far.\n\n\u25aaBNP Paribas Asset Management UK - 1,665,354 shares (\\~$20million) \u25aaPhoenix Holdings Ltd \u2013 1,103,741 shares (\\~$12million)\n\n\u25aaBank of America \u2013 70k shares (\\~$1mill)\n\n\u25aaToronto Dominion Bank \u2013 15k shares (\\~$203k)\n\n\u25aaSTA Wealth Management \u2013 13k shares (\\~$176k)\n\n\u25aaUBS Group \u2013 Increased holdings by 90% to 14,418 shares (\\~$200k)\n\nWe also have in the past month:\n\n\u25aaPolar Asset Management Partners Inc. bought a stake worth $10,935,000.\n\n\u25aaP Schoenfeld Asset Management LP bought a stake worth $5,964,000.\n\n\u25aaGabelli &amp; Co Investment Adviers bought a stake worth $1,772,000.\n\n\u25aaJefferies Group LLC bought a stake worth $1,305,000.\n\nI  have not seen an official number but the closest figure I can find  for  total institutional ownership is around 25-30% . I would imagine  this  will get larger once there is an official merger date.\n\nAs  investors, we would like to see alternative revenue streams to  help the  company grow. ELMS has plans for a few different ways to  increase their  business. One of the main ways is that they will produce  their vans for  the entire North American market (CA and Mexico),  Europe, and China.  Just from the Chinese sales alone, ELMS is  estimating a potential upside  of $300 million. The other major way ELMS  will increase revenue is  through the monitization of their ELMS AIR  data. They will gather and  mine all the data and services from their  vehicles and then use this to  provide valuable information that other  companies will want to buy. They  will also use this data to optimize  and reduce fleet insurance costs.   This data has an estimated upside of  around $50-100 million in increased  revenue. As volume and sales also  increase, they will introduce  passenger van models, as well as rental  or subscription based services.\n\nSome key takeaways from the ELMS financial situation :\n\n\u25aaNo additional capital expected to be required after merger close to fund initial product launches\n\n\u25aaProjected to be Cash Flow Positive by Q42022\n\n\u25aaEstimated 83,000 Units by 2025, representing \\~5% of U.S. Market\n\n\u25aaRevenue projected to reach $3 Billion and EBITDA estimated at $791 Million by end of 2025\n\n# IV. The Indiana Factory\n\n\u200b\n\n[Former Hummer plant that is EV kitted and ready for production in Indiana.](https://preview.redd.it/kw8urirr4ph61.png?width=1097&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0378f103164d7df1f27dcc305307d2ca6b9a9847)\n\nAnother **MASSIVE**  way that ELMS will save a boatload  of cash, and speed up the production  of their van, is through the  former Hummer plant that they will be  taking over in Mishawaka,  Indiana. This plant was originally used for GM  and Hummer, and then  once they folded it got taken over by James Taylor  and his former  company, Seres.  This plant has the capacity to assemble  100,000  vehicles annually, something that ELMS will most likely need to  do by  next year. The Indiana Office of Economic Development Executive   Director Bill Schalliol says \u201cELMS has worked out a deal with the United   Autoworkers Union, which has represented workers at this plant in   recent years. ELMS will initially launch with 140 workers, increasing   staffing to 450 workers when it reaches full production on one line of   smaller vans. Within four years, the company could have 960 employees if   it produces a second assembly line, manufacturing larger sized  delivery  vans.\u201d The Mishawaka plant was selected because it has been  retrofitted  already for electric vehicle production, and has a strong  supply chain  and experienced workforce available. Seres had already put  **$130 million** into building this plant for EV use. How nice of them.\n\nAnother  bonus that will help with the quality and speed of  production \u2013 workers  who are already familiar with the plant and  assembly line. The land  itself is not fully used yet either, and can be  used as a future site  for in house manufacturing of parts.\n\nIn  addition to this plant, as of January, a new global headquarters  with  31,000 square feet of space and capacity for nearly 200 employees  has  been built in Troy, Michigan. The global headquarters strategically   positions ELMS in the center of a network of suppliers and partners  and  provides access to one of the world\u2019s best automotive talent pools.  The  state-of-the-art facility includes an over 15,000 square feet  prototype  lab, where ELMS plans to assemble initial battery pack and  electric  motor prototypes as well as complete pre-production vehicle  builds. ELMS  also plans to utilize the facility as a customer center  where it can  work with customers to understand their vehicle  specifications and  analytics needs, as well as conduct test drives.    \u201cIn addition to  facilitating our growth, the design of our new global  headquarters will  allow for collaboration across all aspects of our  engineering \u2013 from  vehicle design, prototyping and software development  \u2013 and customer  engagement, enabling ELMS to deliver for its customers  the most  efficient and customized solutions for their last mile use  cases,\u201d said  James Taylor.\n\nELMS plans to open  additional offices in California and other  locations in proximity to  major EV talent and development hubs\u201cELMS  plans to build around 4,100  vans by the end of 2021, more than double  output to 9,100 vehicles in  2022 when the second vehicle is added, and  grow to 83,000 for both by  2025. The vehicle and plant are said to be **90% Ready for U.S. Production**.\u201d\n\nDid you read that? **90% READY** !  What other EV SPAC is at this level? Very few, if any at all.\n\n# V. Sokon Auto and ELMS Connection\n\nOk,  sounds good you say. But what's the deal with this Chinese  company that  we've never heard of? Sokon..sokon my what?! Oh that  Sokon. Yes,  officially called Dongfeng Sokon, known internationally as  DFSK. They  have been around since 2003, and are well established in the  Chinese  auto world. They are one of the top 3 manufacturers, actually.  Sokon has  a proven product and demand.  They have over 200,000 gas  models, plus  30,000+ EVs sold in Asia. That equates to over 1 million  miles driven a  day just off their EVs alone. On top of that, they were  the **TOP SELLING EV MODEL in 1H 2020**  in all of China.  Again, Sokon is no no-name company. It has a large  customer base for  their EV fleet, and these are some legitimate  companies that even me  and you can recognize. This includes ecommerce  delivery for JD.com and  Ali Baba, postal service for the China Post,  utilities for the state  grid, and shuttles for the Hong Kong  International Airport.\n\n**Ok, so I guess this isn't some shady random backroom Chinese vaporware  company. So how are they involved with ELMS?**\n\nThis  takes us back to Seres, formally known as SF Motors, the  company our  very own Jim 'the EV Man' Taylor was CEO of in 2019. Seres  was created  in 2016 and ended up being bought and owned by Sokon. An  interesting  side; note, one of the early members of Seres was the  cofounder and  former CEO of Tesla, Martin Eberhard. Guess where Martin  worked before  this? A little company called Atieva, now known as Lucid  Motors! (CCIV  GANG IN THE HOUSE!! They are my #2 to my #1 baby here.  I'm sorry for  cheating on you FIII!!)\n\nOne thing I  want to talk about briefly, as well, is something I have  seen mentioned  regarding \u201cbad reviews\u201d from employees online about  Seres (Glassdoor I  believe). This has been cited as a reason for  concern and uncertainty in  regards to how the leadership behind ELMS  will function. As shown  earlier, the team and leaders we have here will  be the least of our  worries when it comes to whipping a formidable  team and workforce  together. Jim only started working around May, and  Seres had already  been bleeding cash and laying off workers. The  combination of increasing  tensions with China and the hardships of  trying into expand in multiple  countries at once, caused the eventual  dissolution of Seres in the US.   I have wondered also if most of these  reviews were due to turmoil going  on between specific people in the  company, such as Martin Eberhard and  other CEOs. He did get into it  with meme lord Elon and that ended up  leading to his ousting at Tesla.  At Seres, he also ended up leaving them  in less than a year and he took  people along with him to another EV  startup. Doesn't sound like much  of a team player.\n\nSeres  ended up ceasing their US operations, but has continued to  survive  overseas and has successful models in the Dutch market. They  will be  producing a Seres 5 and Seres 7 this year. It doesn't look too  bad to be  honest - kind of like a Porsche Cayenne.\n\n**Now that we know who Sokon is, and have alleviated the concern of them being an unknown entity, what can they do for ELMS?**\n\nWell,  they will get many benefits from this partnership. They get  the  existing EV product portfolio of Sokon, greatly decreasing the time  and  R+D needed to get off the ground. As mentioned before, there is  already a  demand and proven product with these models. No guess work  needed. On  top of that, they get the customer field experience and  warranty data  from the millions of miles already driven in these cars.  This will give  ELMS a huge head start to develop and improve many  aspects of their  automated systems and ELMS AIR. The high volume of  existing supplier  based contracts will be used to their advantage as  well. There will be  absolutely no lack of connections or reach that  this allstar team won't  be able to tap into. And then of course, the  amount of money saved from  the Mishawaka plant and already invested  Sokon development, is well over  half a billion dollars. Nice.\n\n# VI. Is This A Chinese Company?\n\nThe  last thing I want to mention in relation to China and ELMS, is  the  important question of: \u201cIs this a Chinese company or not?\u201d\n\n**The short and easy answer is NO.**\n\n**ELMS is an Independent U.S. Entity**\n\n**They will provide Made-In-USA EVs.**\n\nSokon  will provide the body production parts for ELMS, and CATL  (Tesla  supplier) will provide the batteries. They will use domestic  supply for  the EV powertrain. The inverter and the chassis skateboard  design for  the batteries will be sourced in the U.S. Unfortunately,  ELMS cannot go  fully domestic yet, but is hoping to transition as much  as possible in  the future. Right now, they are also focused on making  sure they can get  an attractive and affordable price point to its  customers. \u201cHey, made  in America. Made in Mishawaka. Half of it\u2019s  American,\u201d he said. \u201cOur  engineers are here. The software guys. The  homologation is all based in  Auburn Hills \\[Michigan\\]. We plan to source  the majority of our EV  systems and componentry here in the U.S.    \u201cYou\u2019ll be going into the  FedExes, Walmarts, all these guys. I\u2019d say  there\u2019s a low chance to sell  them a Chinese truck,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cBut  after we\u2019re finished, it should  be looked at as just a few parts from  China. If we move all the way  into vertical integration, we\u2019re like  everybody else. I\u2019m not sure we  can hang onto that price point.\u201d  So as  we can see, there is some  strategy here at play in order to secure  some of these early and first  mover advantage contracts.\n\n# VII. Technical Analysis\n\nHad  to delete this because reached max character limit. Pretty much  nothing  overly bearish or bullish. FIII broke below resistance the past  2 days  of the 55 EMA, so this week we will look for it to rise above  it and  turn it from resistance back into support.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d5bbf9ns4ph61.png?width=1816&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc3eeb732d6f9791ead9074f990d93d4fe4857a7\n\n# VIII. Conclusion\n\nIf  you made it this far, congratulations. This was a journey to  China and  back. I hope from reading this, you, like me, have become  much more  confident and aware of the future potential of this amazing  new company  called Electric Last Mile Solutions.  I came into this  looking to  alleviate some of my worries about the stagnant and  seemingly void or  negative energy surrounding this company. I came out  the other end a  changed man. They say money doesn't grow on trees, but  they missed one.  The ELMS tree. And it has acorns for all of us.\n\nCome, watch this tree grow with me, friend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img ia2xs2ft4ph61...*\n\nDisclosure: 10,000 warrants, 850 commons Disclaimer I am not a financial adviser, this is not financial advice. Do your own dd. Note: Options just came out last week. Will be accumulating March 12.5C and 15C and June 20C\n\nTLDR:  1st and only Class 1 EV in the US with no competition. Has an  amazing  team and management. Has an EV kitted factory ready for  production by Q3  of this year in Indiana. Has 30,000 preorders already  and expects  30-60k more by next year.

        "selftext": "DISCLAIMER - 3000 COMMONS\n\nTHCB DD - why this is one of the most slept on stocks of the moment and potential 10 bagger\n\nTHCB has recently announced a reverse merger with electric battery maker Microvast \n\n**Microvast DD**\n\n**MICROVAST**\n\nFounded in 2006 Microvast have established themselves as market leader in the development and manufacture of fast charging, long-Life battery systems with superior safety for electric vehicles. \n\nMicrovast's batteries have supplied a range of e-buses, vans, trucks, passenger vehicles, automated guided vehicles, forklifts, and mining trucks. The company has installed batteries in 28,000 vehicles globally and even supplied buses at the 2018 Seoul winter Olympic Games. This international exposure puts Microvast at the top teir of EV suppliers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMicrovast worldwide application\n\nThey have recently released information on a new fast charging battery (HnCO-AH) with a high energy density of 265Wh/kg giving a decisive competitive advantage over current cells for the commercial vehicle sector that have an average density of 240Wh/kg. \n\nin July 2020, Microvast completed construction on a production facility in Ludwigsfelde, Germany (close to potential future clients such as Mercedes-Benzes). The company said it plans to start production in March 2021 to begin making the new battery modules and packs for European customers. Recently the company has posted 77 new jobs for this facility.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMicrovast German facility plan\n\nIn its new plant, Microvast is expected to put together parts made by the company's manufacturing facility in China. At first, the production capacity for the new factory is expected to be 1.5 GWh per year. However, it is expected to ramp up to 6 GWh per year with 250 employees. The new German facility will also function as a research facility and the company\u2019s European headquarters. Microvast said it had invested approximately 50 million euros in the project.\n\nThe company have received credit from the prestigious R&amp;D100 awards for their pioneering design of battery components optimized for high performance and uncompromising safety. This award undoubtedly lead to the United States Advanced Battery Consortium LLC (USABC), a subsidiary of the United States Council for Automotive Research LLC (USCAR), and a collaborative organization of FCA US LLC, Ford Motor Company and General Motors, to announce a $4.5 million contract to Microvast to lead a program to develop low-cost/fast-charge batteries for electric vehicle application. \n\nMicrovast currently exists as a private company and it is still a relative unknown as to how the company is preforming financially. More information on this will come when the DA is announced and is normally contained within the investor\u2019s presentation. The CEO Yang Wu however stated the company expects to generate more than $100 million in revenue in 2020.\n\n**Why buy $THCB**\n\nThere are a number of reasons why I think THCB is a good buy. \n\nTHCB and Microvast tick several boxes.\n\n1. EV Battery play (EV hype) \n\n2. Multinational company with 2 factories in China and one nearing completion in Germany, hoping to start production in Spring.\n\n3. Amazing technology with recognition from the prestigious R&amp;D100 awards for its new high density and safe battery.\n\n4. Projected revenue's of $100m for 2020 (Big positive, SPAC company that has established supply chain and revenue)\n\n5. low public float (27M shares) with 75.69% institutional holdings and 20.85% insiders. There is also touted to be overwhelming interest in this SPAC in Asia (China, Japan, South Korea) by all accounts, and if true, Chinese hedge funds will make this parabolic on ticker change. (this basically means demand &gt; Supply for shares).\n\n6. Microvast as a company have a high projected growth rate which will be accelerated with capital from merger.\n\n\nThis stock should see a move similar to QS which ran from $18-$140 within a month or so back in November/December. They will not have a product available for sale until 2024.

        "selftext": " \n\nHello investors,\n\n(for pictures, please refer to the original [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/lpaf5w/up_fintech_holding_nasdaqtigr_the_next_robinhood/))\n\nI have been sick for the past week and now I'm back on board. Lots happened in the markets, especially in the rates market, and it'll be very interesting to see what the implications of rising yields are for the risk assets. I will be posting market commentary in the next few days.\n\nIn the last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/lexatk/up_fintech_holding_nasdaqtigr_the_next_robinhood/), I mentioned that the computed valuation range for TIGR is anywhere between $33 - $47 (\\~50% - 100% potential upside), compared to the $26 stock price as of 2/5.\n\nThe stock price closed at $36 after-hours this past Friday. I want to note two very important points regarding this.\n\n**1) A good call in the short term is NOT an indicator of success for the long term.**\n\nWhenever you judge someone's investment acumen, including mine, you should NEVER judge anyone based on the success of one's short-term calls or good performance over a two-year period.\n\nJust because I got lucky in catching the ride up in TIGR's stock price movement in the past few weeks doesn't mean I was right nor does it mean that I know where the stock will go in the next few months.\n\nAll it means is that the stock is seeing strong momentum in the short-term due to technical reasons. Nothing more.\n\nIn the short-term, this could be a good opportunity to benefit from an asymmetric risk-reward profile utilizing an options strategy.\n\nFundamentally and for the long term, what you should be focused on instead is its 5-10 year growth trajectory and the **reasons** why this company will grow in the future.\n\nIf you think about it, it's relatively straightforward.\n\nSay the stock goes from $36 to $100 in the next few weeks. Is that a win for you? Over the long term it may be or it may be not. You will take the profits and reinvest into something else and keep investing forever. Those profits can be easily lost by bad investments we make in the future. The key is **consistency.** And consistency is born out of good research and sound analysis.\n\nAs I said in this [memo](https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/ju7zbi/investing_philosophy_plz_read_this/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), **results and analyses should be independently judged**. Good results on bad analyses don\u2019t mean much, because chances are, you will get bad results in the future based on bad analyses.\n\n2) **Valuations are always subjective and my assumptions in the last memo were fairly conservative**.\n\nYou can plug anything you want to come up with a valuation you want. It is important to be able to back those assumptions with qualitative analyses of the business.\n\nNow back to TIGR.\n\nI. Business Overview\n\nII. Thesis I: UI and easy access that are gaining popularity\n\nIII. Thesis II: high switching cost and early mover advantage\n\nIV. Thesis III: relatively strong corporate governance\n\nV. Risks\n\nVI. Conclusion\n\nI: **Business Overview**\n\nTiger Brokers is an online brokerage firm focusing on global Chinese investors. They allow global trading to be done at little or no commissions. You can trade in US markets, Singapore, Southeast Asian countries, and European markets easily.\n\nAnd as with typical brokerage firms, they earn revenues through two main sources: commission fees and interest income on margins/securities lending, contributing 45% and 28% of 2019 total revenues, respectively.\n\nThe company's primary clearing agent is Interactive Brokers, which they rely on to execute, settle, and a substantial portion of the trades of the U.S. and Hong Kong stocks.\n\nMinimum deposit that customers must have to maintain a margin account is $2k.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nThe company was founded by a Tsinghua University computer science graduate in 2015. It has gained popularity amongst the tech-savvy Chinese millennials, 72% of its customers are under 35 years old, because the company makes it cheaper and easier for Chinese citizens to invest in US-listed stocks. The founder was a former employee at NetEase, a Chinese internet giant.\n\nII: **Thesis I: UI and easy access that are gaining popularity**\n\nWith B2C companies, I always try to check out the products/services myself but this time, I scooped up some reviews of Tiger Brokers.\n\nOne thing I'd comment about the reviews is to take them with a grain of salt. Even if I personally don't like the app and if lots of people on media have posted bad reviews about the platform, these could be just the minority. The only thing that matters is that the app is gaining traction on average. There will always be haters and people with bad experiences with the apps so as long as the number of users is growing exponentially, we are in the clear.\n\nBelow are some reviews.\n\n\" Tiger Brokers stands out because of their low fees and all inclusive digital platform. Their commission costs of 0.08% and minimum of S$0 per trade (until the end of 2020), overtakes [Saxo Markets](https://www.valuechampion.sg/saxo-capital-markets-online-brokerage-review)\u2014who charges a commission fee of 0.08% a minimum of S$10 per trade\u2014as the cheapest provider in Singapore. \"\n\n\" This is due to their simple, clear cut illustration of real-time market data on the SGX, NASDAQ, NYSE and HKEX. \"\n\nSource: [https://www.valuechampion.sg/tiger-brokers-online-brokerage-review](https://www.valuechampion.sg/tiger-brokers-online-brokerage-review)\n\n\" **Exposure to different markets &amp; instruments with just one account.** (Singapore, US, Hong Kong, Australia &amp; China stock market, Futures (soon), Warrants &amp; Options) \"\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nSource: [https://nomoneylah.com/2020/10/30/tiger-brokers-review/](https://nomoneylah.com/2020/10/30/tiger-brokers-review/)\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nSource: [https://www.singsaver.com.sg/blog/tiger-brokers-review](https://www.singsaver.com.sg/blog/tiger-brokers-review)\n\nUI\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nSource: [https://betterspider.com/tiger-brokers-review/](https://betterspider.com/tiger-brokers-review/)\n\nAt first glance, I think the app is not too different from the US counterparts in terms of the UI. One thing that differentiates the app from Robinhood is that it's got fundamentals data available.\n\nBased on the below graphs, we know that the platform is certainly appealing to the audience.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nIf you noticed in the graph, while the total number of customer accounts has been growing, # of customers with deposits is only about 1/6 of the total number of accounts.\n\nThis gap is due to the process involving account verification, submitting official government identity documents, and transferring US dollars to their accounts (more on this later).\n\nIn other words, the rising customer accounts are backlogs of customer accounts with deposits.\n\nHowever, the management said during the earnings call that they are focusing heavily on an international expansion strategy, with international funded accounts expected to account for more than 50% of paying clients in the next 12 to 24 months.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nThis is also an important metric to look out for. As long as we see more ammo in their customers' accounts, we can expect to see higher trading volumes in the coming future.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nWe should also continue to monitor this metric since the company directly derives its revenues from trading volume.\n\nIII: **Thesis II: high switching cost and early mover advantage**\n\nI don't totally understand how it works with opening an account in China and actually trading in the account but based on readings, it seems that it is relatively more difficult to do it compared to the US.\n\nIt is also apparent that Tiger Brokers makes it easier to do the whole process for the users.\n\nIt has been difficult for mainland Chinese investors to buy stocks on Hong Kong or US-based exchanges because the regulations designed to control the value of the Chinese currency limit the purchase of foreign currency up to $50k per person per year.\n\nTiger Brokers bypassed the need to obtain a Chinese brokerage license, the supply of which is very tight, and allowed its users to trade in US-listed equities. It also requires its users to acquire dollars on their own and transfer them to Tiger's offshore brokerage entities to be able to trade in the US equities.\n\nAll of this hassle creates a high barrier to entry for potential competitors as it is legally difficult to invest in global equities in China.\n\nThere are still risks from competition such as Futu Holding, which also focuses on Chinese investors. I will talk about that in the Risks section.\n\nIt is also one of the earlier movers in the industry. Futu and Tiger are the two fastest-growing brokerages focused on Chinese consumers.\n\nIV: **Thesis III: relatively strong corporate governance**\n\nAs with any company, it is critical to look at how the management is incentivized.\n\nAt first glance, the management's goals are aligned with shareholders given their 18% ownership in the company.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nI briefly mentioned about the founder's background but here are the details from the annual reports. I think it's worth going over them to ensure that it's not a case of a non-tech person with a major in social science venturing into the artificial intelligence industry.\n\n\\--\n\nMr. Tianhua Wu has served as our Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, and director since January 2018. Mr. Wu is the founder and CEO of Ningxia Rongke since June 2014. Between 2005 and 2014, Mr. Wu served at Youdao of NetEase Inc., where he was responsible for core search. Mr. Wu has received many honors in the business world. He was awarded \u201cEntrepreneurial Elite under 35\u201d in 2016 and \u201c40 Business Elites under 40 in China\u201d in 2017. He currently serves as a director for Ningxia Haozhong Management Consulting Center LLP and Beijing Yian Management &amp; Consulting Co., Ltd. Mr. Wu obtained both bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in computer science and technology from Tsinghua University.\n\nMr. John Fei Zeng has served as our Chief Financial Officer since October 2018. Between 2010 and 2012, Mr. Zeng worked at the equity sales team of CICC. Between 2012 and 2015, he worked as a Director at UBS Global Capital Market. From 2015 to 2018, he served as an Executive Director in Equity Capital Markets (ECM) at Goldman Sachs, where he was the ECM captain for China fintech and healthcare sectors. Mr. Zeng obtained a B.S. degree in business administration from the University of Southern California and an MBA from New York University.\n\nMs. Katherine Wei Wu has served as our Chief Compliance Officer since April 2019. Ms. Wu has over 20 years of experience in compliance at various international financial institutions. Ms. Wu served as Executive Director in Compliance at Haitong International from February 2016 to February 2019. She served as Executive Director in Compliance at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc. from August 2010 to January 2016. Ms. Wu obtained her Juris Doctor degree from Fordham University School of Law and Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree in Economics from Mount Holyoke College.\n\nMr. Yonggang Liu has served as our Vice President of Technology since 2014 and director since June 2018. He worked at Youdao of NetEase Inc. from 2008 to 2014, in charge of the technology team. From 2006 to 2007, Mr. Liu was responsible for developing the OCL Editor project at IBM. Mr. Yonggang Liu received a bachelor\u2019s degree in information management from Beijing Information Science &amp; Technology University and a master\u2019s degree in computer science from Peking University. On April 23, 2020, Mr. Liu informed the Board of his intention to resign, and the board approved his resignation effective on April 27, 2020.\n\n\\--\n\nIt seems that all the c-suite executives have relevant backgrounds and have extensive experiences in their fields.\n\nV: **Risks**\n\nIn my opinion, the most important risk to keep in mind is competition. Futu is currently the biggest threat to TIGR but other than Futu, the rest of the competitors are essentially the established brokerage firms in the respective countries.\n\nI'm not sure if Futu is better or worse than TIGR. What I do know is that both companies are high-quality, fast-growing companies and they could both be winners in the future, just like TD Ameritrade and E\\*trade or Uber and Lyft. It's not a winner takes all game like Facebook or Google.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, I would split investments into both companies, although I prefer TIGR since it's got much smaller market cap and more room for growth.\n\nAnother key risk is corporate governance. It's impossible to tell if this company is cooking up its financials or doing something funky in the background and we should always discount those risks when investing in countries where the accounting risks are higher than the US.\n\nRemember, the US also went through the whole accounting reformation through Enron and Sarbanes-Oxley.\n\nLastly, the heightened valuation is also a major risk. I am in it for the long term so the current valuation doesn't scare me but I talked about that in detail in Part I. I think it's more important \"that\" you get in on the investment rather than \"when\" you get in, but that's a personal preference.\n\nVI: **Conclusion**\n\nThe company has clear tailwinds, including rising disposable income of Chinese households, increasing the proportion of Chinese millennials who are interested in buying US stocks, and greater openness to foreign investments by the Chinese government.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nI believe the company will grow at least 10x, if not 50x, in the next ten years and it is one of my favorite picks at the moment.\n\nUpstart holdings will be next. It is a cloud-based lender in the US and I'm just as exciteted for this company as I am for TIGR.\n\nFor those interested in signing up for the email distribution list, here is the [link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1HZ56NtaQYCsOmiCwQjHOQJvTlN-1bGm02GrqVxt6qQc/edit). I use it to send any attachments.\n\nThank you all for reading and please feel free to leave feedback!",

        "selftext": "Hello  All, this is my first DD. It is long but I hope you will enjoy it. I  wanted to do an in-depth dive into the company Forum Merger 3 (FIII) ,   who is merging with Electric Last Mile Solutions, an EV company   specializing in last mile delivery and work vans. FIII will be the first   and only Class 1 electric vehicle on the market, coming as early as  Q3,  with no other Class 1 EV as competition. They are also bringing a  Class  2 EV truck to market next year. A key factor in allowing ELMS to  be  first to market in Class 1 is the fact that they are taking over the  old  Hummer plant in Indiana. Additionally, they have the luxury of  working  with an already successful EV company, allowing for instant   transposition of truck plans ready for production.\n\nFIII has intrigued me  from the get go being an EV SPAC, yet it has  received little to no  attention which is reflected in the current stock  price. There has been  little to no movement on the stock other than  some sideways and  downwards action, which is atypical behavior for most  EV SPACs. So what  gives?\n\nAfter doing some digging, it appears that the main concern holding   back most investors back from committing to this great company is their   connection and relations to (((CHINA))), which comes by way of a   company in particular called Sokon Automotive.This concern is not   unwarranted, as ties to China have been an issue of concern in the   market lately. As investors, especially when dealing with new companies,   we want maximum transparency, which seems almost impossible any time   we're dealing with a Chinese company. However, as my research has shown,   the ELMS relationship with China is nothing to be concerned about. In   fact, it is quite the opposite \u2013 something that will help propel them   forward and accelerate their process through previously successfully   developed truck plans and numerous industry connections.\n\n# I.  The Team\n\nFirst,  let's take a look at who is behind the team. As we have come  to know, a  SPAC is only as good as the team behind it. The team behind  ELMS is an   All-Star cast of players in the auto industry with years of  experience  and accomplishments.  After looking into each of the team  members, some  interesting connections emerged amongst them and amongst  different   auto/EV companies(including a connection to Tesla) . These  connections  made some of the pieces start to fall into place. In  particular, I  wanted to figure out more so their connection to the  Chinese players.  Was it sketchy and something to be concerned about?  After digging deeper  my questions were answered.\n\n\u200b\n\n[The Allstars](https://preview.redd.it/vx58ggdybph61.png?width=989&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64d8eda0687bcc9c251e738bc5ec749e4ae602be)\n\n***The Allstars*** ***-***\n\n**James (Jim) Taylor** \u2013 35+ years experience \u2013 CEO and Founder of ELMS, former executive at **Karma**. Former CEO of **Workhorse,**   he pivoted the company\u2019s focus from the electrification of cars and   SUVs to medium duty commercial trucks. Former CEO of SF Motors, now   known as Seres(owned by Sokon, the company they are working with).   Worked at **General Motors**, serving as President of **Cadillac** and CEO of **Hummer**.   Led the design and technology upgrading of the new model of Cadillac,   which contributed to the revival of the brand. This guy is the   powerhouse behind ELMS. James knows what it takes to build a company and   what it takes to pivot to the emerging world of  EVs. He probably has   some of the most experience of anyone in the industry when it comes to   EVs, having worked on both Karma (with Henrik Fisker of FSR) and   Workhorse which we all know. His innovation and experience on developing   different types of EVs, will allow for future design and build   improvements. Jim, also Canadian, is known as \u201cThe Great One\u201d when it   comes to the EV world. He is also known as Jim \u201cThe EV Man\u201d Taylor,   because like the show Home Improvement, he is always building and   innovating in the garage.\n\n**Jason Luo** \u2013 25+ years experience -  Executive Chairman and Co-Founder of ELMS. Former CEO of Key Safety Systems, **Ford** China and **Accuride**.    Jason served for nearly a decade as CEO of Key Safety Systems (now   Joyson Safety Systems), one of the largest automotive safety companies   in the world.  Oversaw the company\u2019s acquisition of Takata Corporation   for $1.6 billion. Jason currently serves on the board of directors of   Accuride, Elo Touch Solutions, ATC Drivetrain and Sybridge Technologies.    He has extensive experience in the automotive world and more   importantly with large companies. In addition he has been through a few   different mergers and acquisitions which is an added benefit. He knows   what it takes to come out on top.\n\n**Shauna McIntyre, -** 20+ years **-** CEO, Sense Photonics, Inc. (LiDAR) and Former program lead, **Google** automotive services, **Alphabet**,   Inc .  She previously led Google\u2019s automotive services program, during   which time she released Google products, including Google Maps, into   automakers\u2019 new vehicle models. Since 2019, she has served on the Board   of Directors of Lithia Motors, the world's 3rd largest auto dealer.   One  interesting piece of info I found is that she is the co-founder of a   group called **The North American Council for Freight Efficiency**   (NACFE). They focus specifically on turning the transportation  industry  into a more economical and EV friendly space. One video I  found on  their group website was called \u201cHigh-Potential Regions for  Electric  Truck Deployments\u201d. It talked about geographical areas they  want to  focus on and develop \u2013 one of them being the Great Lakes. Guess  where  the new ELMS factory will be? Right around the Great Lakes.   This group  puts out monthly newsletters and events , so she can use  this board as a  means to spread the word throughout the industry.  Interestingly enough,  this group just started running an EV truck demo  for data collection  and analytics, and two of the companies already  involved are  GIK(Lightning E-motors) and Workhorse.\n\n**Richard Peretz, -** 40+ years **-**  Former CFO, **United Parcel Service (UPS)**,    during which time he opened UPS operations in China. Richard also   helped expand the company\u2019s international  footprint in many European   and Asian countries. You can bet that this will help ELMS get some   international connections. Hes overseen numerous acquisitions, as well   as being a leading member of the team that managed UPS\u2019s IPO in 1999, at   the time the largest in U.S. history. He is no stranger to   understanding what it takes to make a new operation a successful one.\n\n**Brian Krzanich, -** 25+ years -  CEO, CDK Global (one of the biggest technologies for dealerships) and Former CEO, **Intel Corporation**.   Oversaw the acquisition of companies such as autonomous driving  company  Mobileye. This guy is a pimp daddy. He was forced to resign  from Intel  because he got caught having a relationship with an  employee. You could  say she really turned his software into hardware!  Brian currently serves  on the boards of AMS AG and Footprint US  (sustainable technology). He  previously served on the Boards of Deere  &amp; Company and Semiconductor  Industry Association, as well as  serving as the Chair of the FAA Drone  Advisory Committee.

The fact that the Chinese companies that are   connected with the team include the likes of Ford and UPS, tell me that   there is a legitimacy to their business dealings. This team covers many   bases that are necessary for ELMS to be a top contender in the ev  world.  These players have tons of experience, have held top level  positions at  top tier companies, and have the knowledge and know-how in  many  different aspects of electric vehicles and the industry overall.\n\n# II. What Does ELMS Do?\n\nNow  that we know who ELMS is , lets take a look at what exactly they   do.ELMS offers the only Class 1 EV in an underserved commercial  delivery  industry.  Some of the advantages ELMS has over other EV  companies  include:\n\n\u25aaFirst and Only Class 1 .  The fact that they are a first mover is  absolutely HUGE for  establishing themselves and cashing in on the  opportunity of being alone  in the field.\n\n\u25aaFactory in Indiana already kitted out for EV production\n\n\u25aaCars ready by Q3 of this year. Most EV SPACs aren't on the road until 2022 and later\n\n\u25aaLowest total cost of ownership in Class 1\n\n\u25aaAlready proven successful product based off top selling 2020 EV model in China\n\nHere is a pretty chart comparing them to some competitors. Note \u2013 this is from December so it may have changed some since.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5l03reg5hph61.png?width=1719&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7103d77485bd0f678254717a1a8c6b8c359b8c9\n\nOnly Class 1 - no other competition\n\n\u200bThe  ELMS Urban Delivery van costs the same or cheaper as its  gasoline  counterparts ($32,500-7500 credit =$25k),  but has 35% more  cargo space ,  at 170 cubic ft, and a cheaper total cost of ownership by  35% (50%  compared to a class 2). The cost per year comes to around  $1550 for ELMS  Urban Delivery vs $4000 for a regular gas Class 1. It  becomes even  cheaper when you factor in the extra cargo volume per  cubic ft that it  provides.The 2022 Class 2/3 model will have 218ft. It  appears that they  have plans to make different variations of their  Class 1 and Class 3,  being able to turn them into Class 2s as well  based off individual  needs. They will have a range of 150 to 200 miles  and be capable of a  full recharge in as little as two hours. These  types of vans are used in  many capacities of our society. For example,  delivery and ecommerce  (Amazon, Fedex, DHL), communications (Verizon,  Comcast), small  businesses (local flower shop, food trucks), and  utility and local  municipality vehicles. There is no lack of demand for  these types of  vehicles.\n\nA cool feature that will  probably be a huge sales point for ELMS  that I think has been  overlooked, is that they will be upfitting the  vans themselves.  Upfitting is the process of taking the vehicle to a  specialist to be  equipped to meet the specific needs of that business.  This includes  things like installing custom drawers and cabinets,  shelving, lighting,  power supplies, etc. The typical upfitting process  involves a 3rd party  vendor or sometimes numerous different ones, and  takes on avg 130-140  days from order to delivery. The ELMS custom  upfitting process allows  for :\n\n\u25aa \\~25% reduction time from order to delivery\n\n\u25aa One warranty single point of contact for customer\n\n\u25aa  Total vehicle value chain cost reduced by 5+%ELMS are also  currently in  talks with the leading upfitter brands IVS, Adrian Steel,  and Auto  Truck Group.\n\nI have found no other EV that has said they will be doing something like this yet.\n\n\u200b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wbhr6wb7hph61.png?width=1716&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a590947664243a09652467c8148d123d8cd368af\n\nCustom Upfitting for any business needs. Takes out the need for 3rd party.\n\nNext,  the ELMS vehicles will be connected with a system called ELMS  AIR, an  over-the-air programming system. I have not been able to find  much  information about any specifics except for some clues in their  investor  presentation.  They will use these over-the-air data systems  in  partnership with the industry leading Geotab to provide many  benefits to  their customers. Some areas that will be serviced include :\n\n\u25aaProductivity - accurate arrival and departure times ,true trip miles\n\n\u25aaOptimization - increase energy efficiency, record powertrain diagnostics, vehicle maintenance\n\n\u25aaCompliance - electronic driver logs, tax reporting, vehicle inspection reports\n\n\u25aaExpandability - system integration, hardware add-ons &amp; software add-ins\n\nSome  of the obvious benefits of a type of system, like we see in  Tesla for  example, are the ability for the software updates to happen  frequently  and easily, along with data  constantly being in  communication with the  main servers. The more data that is able to be  collected, the better  optimized these services and vehicles can be. The  experience and  knowledge of BigPoppa Brian Krzanich from Intel will   be valuable in  this aspect. What we will end up seeing with a system  like this is more  and more areas of value for the companies buying it.  For example, there  will be savings from being able to easily collect  accurate tax data and  driving logs from the drivers. Time will also be  saved with something  such as the automated updates and knowing exactly  when a van will need  to be serviced or inspected. As time goes on and  more data becomes  collected, the ELMS AIR service will only prove to be  more valuable for  both the company and their customers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img slq253w9hph61...*\n\n# III. Sales and Financials\n\nThe  FIII team has  $250 million in trust, and $155M PIPE in  connection with  the merger. ELMS will have a  $1.4billion enterprise  value at closing.  The ELMS team is expected to have $379 million of  cash to fund  operations and growth. They have said that no additional  capital  requirements are needed after close to achieve positive cash  flow.  With  their $379 million cash minus $150mill in debt, that gives  us $229  million in net cash to work with. There are a total of  142,500,000  shares. Current market cap at the share price of $12, gives  us $1.71  billion.\n\nELMS currently has 30,000  pre-orders for its delivery van,  representing a revenue of $1billion.  They expect another 30,000 to  60,000 orders by the middle of 2021. Some  of the companies they are in  talks with or have preorders from already,  include: Penske, Cox +  Siemens (cant make that up), Merchants,  Enterprise, IVS, and others.  These contracts will work directly with  companies such as Ikea, Best  Buy, Walmart, Fedex, Ryder and more. The  experience and connections of  the team will no doubt lead to more  contracts in the future.\n\nThe ELMS  business plan includes a conservative volume ramp, with  approximately  4,000 vehicles expected to be delivered by the fourth  quarter of 2021,  accelerating to approximately 19,000 deliveries in  2022, and  approximately 35,000 deliveries in 2023. \u201cOur team  collectively has  decades of experience launching vehicles for global  OEMs, and so while  the facility has an annual production capacity of  100,000 units, we are  deliberately conservative in our initial volumes  so that we can be  laser-focused on quality and, as a new brand,  establishing an excellent  reputation with our customers.\u201d\n\nI  have seen some grumblings about the fine print of the 30,000  preorders  being \u201ccontingent upon satisfaction of customer  requirements.\u201d As you  will see shortly, this is a successful and more  than satisfactory  vehicle and has been proven to be so based off its  Chinese sales all  year. I have zero doubt that this team will give the  customers  everything they want and then some. If anything, I would  expect the ELMS  vehicles be even better than their Sokon counterpart.\n\n\u200b\n\n*Processing img ag7iltkahph61...*\n\nCompanies ELMS is in talks with or has pre-orders from.\n\n\u200b\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*Put on your tinfoil hat and sunglasses and follow me real quick\\*\\*\\***\\*\n\n*THEORY #1*: ELMS will receive a future contract due to its relation to the new **Secretary of  Transportation, Pete Buttigieg**.   Before his run for president last year, good ole Petey boy was the   mayor of South Bend, Indiana. He has been known to have very mixed   results there in terms of popularity, but he did put an emphasis on   creating more jobs and projects to rebuild the area. Guess where the new   ELMS factory is located? Yup, literally right next to South Bend in  the  bordering town of Mishikawa. Could it be possible that ELMS will  have  first priority now for any new government contracts relating to EV  delivery or services, or maybe additional funding/credits? Quite possibly. We all know of Biden's plan to electrify the US, and now Mayor  Pete has a perfect opportunity to give back to his hometown and bring   more jobs and prosperity to South Bend and the surrounding areas. And as a matter of fact, Pete Buttigieg  actually held a campaign rally at the ELMS(Hummer) factory last year. This means ELMS are 100% on his  radar.\n\n*THEORY #2*:  This picture right here was mentioned in the  investor presentation when  they were giving examples of how their  trucks will be used for  municipalities. At first glance I thought  nothing of it and said hey  just some random counties they have worked  with. The Michigan and  Indiana seals make sense since that's where they  are located. And the  California ones also since that's where most of  the former employees and  Seres motors was headquartered. But then I  noticed the top left seal,  from Fairfax, Virginia. This just so happens  to be right next to my  hometown so I am very familiar with this area.  Why does the Fairfax, VA  seal appear alongside those of Michigan,  Indiana, and California?  A  side note about Fairfax County \u2013 it is very  wealthy and very liberal.  Turns out they have quite a few Green  Initiatives in action. Last year  they stated that \u201cOne-hundred percent  of eligible county vehicles  scheduled for purchase in fiscal year 2021  shall be replaced with  electric vehicles and the infrastructure needed  can be supported in  fiscal year 2021.\u201d  Just a few weeks ago another  article stated \u201cFairfax  County Public Schools is getting its first  electric school bus today as  part of a statewide initiative led by  Dominion Energy.\u201d Interesting! It  seems quite obvious Fairfax County is  gearing up for wide scale EV  adoption, and wants to do implement it as  soon as possible. Maryland and  D.C. rank 8th and 9th for highest rate  of EV adoption, while Virginia  ranks 23rd. You can be damn sure they  will be looking to improve on that  number.\n\n\u200b\n\n*Processing img 4tyh7gzbhph61...*\n\nPeculiar section of their investors presentation which shows Fairfax County, VA in the top left. Could these be potential county contracts they are working on?\n\nSpeaking of government contracts, ELMS has **ALREADY**   received funding from the state of Indiana.  In late December, the   Indiana Economic Development Corporation (IEDC), which leads the state\u2019s   economic development efforts,  offered ELMS a series of conditional  tax  credits and training grants based on its plans to create new jobs  in  its factory. The IEDC offered up to **$10 million** in conditional tax credits and up to **$200,000** in conditional training grants based on the company\u2019s job creation plans. The IEDC also offered up to **$2.8 million**   in conditional tax credits from the Hoosier Business Investment (HBI)   tax credit program based on the company\u2019s planned capital investment in   Indiana. This may not be that much money-wise, but it is an excellent   start to pave the way for future endeavors.\n\nAnother  huge benefit for ELMS is that they have a fraction of the  typical  startup cost for EV production. The typical cost for entry into  the N.A.  market is around  $1.6 billion. With the help of the already  successful  Sokon, which provided about $570 million of investments  already, ELMS  only needs to contribute around $160 million. This gives  them much more  wiggle room to grow and try new things.If we compare  ELMS money  situation versus other EV competitors, \u201cRivian\u2019s becoming  the poster  child, smoking through $2 billion, $3 billion,\u201d Taylor said.  \u201cIf you  think $200 million to $300 million for product engineering,  ours is $80  million, That\u2019s really just airbags, seat belts and  adapting to \\[U.S.  safety requirements\\]. Tooling is already in place  because SERES spent  $20 million for the canceled SUV plans. Earlier  post-Hummer occupants  also left some usable equipment behind. \u201cComing  off the existing  platform is worth hundreds of millions,\u201d Taylor said.  \u201cSupplier tooling  alone would normally be a couple hundred million.\u201d  Well, that's a  bargain.\n\nThe institutional ownership of FIII has been climbing recently. There has  been multiple funds purchasing within the last week:\n\n\u25aaAlpine  Global Management, bought 2,135,286 shares (valued around   $25.6million), equaling 8.3% of FIII. One of the biggest purchases so   far.\n\n\u25aaBNP Paribas Asset Management UK - 1,665,354 shares (\\~$20million) \u25aaPhoenix Holdings Ltd \u2013 1,103,741 shares (\\~$12million)\n\n\u25aaBank of America \u2013 70k shares (\\~$1mill)\n\n\u25aaToronto Dominion Bank \u2013 15k shares (\\~$203k)\n\n\u25aaSTA Wealth Management \u2013 13k shares (\\~$176k)\n\n\u25aaUBS Group \u2013 Increased holdings by 90% to 14,418 shares (\\~$200k)\n\nWe also have in the past month:\n\n\u25aaPolar Asset Management Partners Inc. bought a stake worth $10,935,000.\n\n\u25aaP Schoenfeld Asset Management LP bought a stake worth $5,964,000.\n\n\u25aaGabelli &amp; Co Investment Adviers bought a stake worth $1,772,000.\n\n\u25aaJefferies Group LLC bought a stake worth $1,305,000.\n\nI  have not seen an official number but the closest figure I can find  for  total institutional ownership is around 25-30% . I would imagine  this  will get larger once there is an official merger date.\n\nAs  investors, we would like to see alternative revenue streams to  help the  company grow. ELMS has plans for a few different ways to  increase their  business. One of the main ways is that they will produce  their vans for  the entire North American market (CA and Mexico),  Europe, and China.  Just from the Chinese sales alone, ELMS is  estimating a potential upside  of $300 million. The other major way ELMS  will increase revenue is  through the monitization of their ELMS AIR  data. They will gather and  mine all the data and services from their  vehicles and then use this to  provide valuable information that other  companies will want to buy. They  will also use this data to optimize  and reduce fleet insurance costs.   This data has an estimated upside of  around $50-100 million in increased  revenue. As volume and sales also  increase, they will introduce  passenger van models, as well as rental  or subscription based services.\n\nSome key takeaways from the ELMS financial situation :\n\n\u25aaNo additional capital expected to be required after merger close to fund initial product launches\n\n\u25aaProjected to be Cash Flow Positive by Q42022\n\n\u25aaEstimated 83,000 Units by 2025, representing \\~5% of U.S. Market\n\n\u25aaRevenue projected to reach $3 Billion and EBITDA estimated at $791 Million by end of 2025\n\n# IV. The Indiana Factory\n\n\u200b\n\n*Processing img i2nckdadhph61...*\n\nFormer Hummer plant that is EV kitted and ready for production in Indiana.\n\nAnother **MASSIVE**  way that ELMS will save a boatload  of cash, and speed up the production  of their van, is through the  former Hummer plant that they will be  taking over in Mishawaka,  Indiana. This plant was originally used for GM  and Hummer, and then  once they folded it got taken over by James Taylor  and his former  company, Seres.  This plant has the capacity to assemble  100,000  vehicles annually, something that ELMS will most likely need to  do by  next year. The Indiana Office of Economic Development Executive   Director Bill Schalliol says \u201cELMS has worked out a deal with the United   Autoworkers Union, which has represented workers at this plant in   recent years. ELMS will initially launch with 140 workers, increasing   staffing to 450 workers when it reaches full production on one line of   smaller vans. Within four years, the company could have 960 employees if   it produces a second assembly line, manufacturing larger sized  delivery  vans.\u201d The Mishawaka plant was selected because it has been  retrofitted  already for electric vehicle production, and has a strong  supply chain  and experienced workforce available. Seres had already put  **$130 million** into building this plant for EV use. How nice of them.\n\nAnother  bonus that will help with the quality and speed of  production \u2013 workers  who are already familiar with the plant and  assembly line. The land  itself is not fully used yet either, and can be  used as a future site  for in house manufacturing of parts.\n\nIn  addition to this plant, as of January, a new global headquarters  with  31,000 square feet of space and capacity for nearly 200 employees  has  been built in Troy, Michigan. The global headquarters strategically   positions ELMS in the center of a network of suppliers and partners  and  provides access to one of the world\u2019s best automotive talent pools.  The  state-of-the-art facility includes an over 15,000 square feet  prototype  lab, where ELMS plans to assemble initial battery pack and  electric  motor prototypes as well as complete pre-production vehicle  builds. ELMS  also plans to utilize the facility as a customer center  where it can  work with customers to understand their vehicle  specifications and  analytics needs, as well as conduct test drives.    \u201cIn addition to  facilitating our growth, the design of our new global  headquarters will  allow for collaboration across all aspects of our  engineering \u2013 from  vehicle design, prototyping and software development  \u2013 and customer  engagement, enabling ELMS to deliver for its customers  the most  efficient and customized solutions for their last mile use  cases,\u201d said  James Taylor.\n\nELMS plans to open  additional offices in California and other  locations in proximity to  major EV talent and development hubs\u201cELMS  plans to build around 4,100  vans by the end of 2021, more than double  output to 9,100 vehicles in  2022 when the second vehicle is added, and  grow to 83,000 for both by  2025. The vehicle and plant are said to be **90% Ready for U.S. Production**.\u201d\n\nDid you read that? **90% READY** !  What other EV SPAC is at this level? Very few, if any at all.\n\n# V. Sokon Auto and ELMS Connection\n\nOk,  sounds good you say. But what's the deal with this Chinese  company that  we've never heard of? Sokon..sokon my what?! Oh that  Sokon. Yes,  officially called Dongfeng Sokon, known internationally as  DFSK. They  have been around since 2003, and are well established in the  Chinese  auto world. They are one of the top 3 manufacturers, actually.  Sokon has  a proven product and demand.  They have over 200,000 gas  models, plus  30,000+ EVs sold in Asia. That equates to over 1 million  miles driven a  day just off their EVs alone. On top of that, they were  the **TOP SELLING EV MODEL in 1H 2020**  in all of China.  Again, Sokon is no no-name company. It has a large  customer base for  their EV fleet, and these are some legitimate  companies that even me  and you can recognize. This includes ecommerce  delivery for JD.com and  Ali Baba, postal service for the China Post,  utilities for the state  grid, and shuttles for the Hong Kong  International Airport.\n\n**Ok, so I guess this isn't some shady random backroom Chinese vaporware  company. So how are they involved with ELMS?**\n\nThis  takes us back to Seres, formally known as SF Motors, the  company our  very own Jim 'the EV Man' Taylor was CEO of in 2019. Seres  was created  in 2016 and ended up being bought and owned by Sokon. An  interesting  side; note, one of the early members of Seres was the  cofounder and  former CEO of Tesla, Martin Eberhard. Guess where Martin  worked before  this? A little company called Atieva, now known as Lucid  Motors! \n\nOne thing I  want to talk about briefly, as well, is something I have  seen mentioned  regarding \u201cbad reviews\u201d from employees online about  Seres (Glassdoor I  believe). This has been cited as a reason for  concern and uncertainty in  regards to how the leadership behind ELMS  will function. As shown  earlier, the team and leaders we have here will  be the least of our  worries when it comes to whipping a formidable  team and workforce  together. Jim only started working around May, and  Seres had already  been bleeding cash and laying off workers. The  combination of increasing  tensions with China and the hardships of  trying into expand in multiple  countries at once, caused the eventual  dissolution of Seres in the US.   I have wondered also if most of these  reviews were due to turmoil going  on between specific people in the  company, such as Martin Eberhard and  other CEOs. He did get into it  with meme lord Elon and that ended up  leading to his ousting at Tesla.  At Seres, he also ended up leaving them  in less than a year and he took  people along with him to another EV  startup. Doesn't sound like much  of a team player.\n\nSeres  ended up ceasing their US operations, but has continued to  survive  overseas and has successful models in the Dutch market. They  will be  producing a Seres 5 and Seres 7 this year. It doesn't look too  bad to be  honest - kind of like a Porsche Cayenne.\n\n**Now that we know who Sokon is, and have alleviated the concern of them being an unknown entity, what can they do for ELMS?**\n\nWell,  they will get many benefits from this partnership. They get  the  existing EV product portfolio of Sokon, greatly decreasing the time  and  R+D needed to get off the ground. As mentioned before, there is  already a  demand and proven product with these models. No guess work  needed. On  top of that, they get the customer field experience and  warranty data  from the millions of miles already driven in these cars.  This will give  ELMS a huge head start to develop and improve many  aspects of their  automated systems and ELMS AIR. The high volume of  existing supplier  based contracts will be used to their advantage as  well. There will be  absolutely no lack of connections or reach that  this allstar team won't  be able to tap into. And then of course, the  amount of money saved from  the Mishawaka plant and already invested  Sokon development, is well over  half a billion dollars. Nice.\n\n# VI. Is This A Chinese Company?\n\nThe  last thing I want to mention in relation to China and ELMS, is  the  important question of: \u201cIs this a Chinese company or not?\u201d\n\n**The short and easy answer is NO.**\n\n**ELMS is an Independent U.S. Entity**\n\n**They will provide Made-In-USA EVs.**\n\nSokon  will provide the body production parts for ELMS, and CATL  (Tesla  supplier) will provide the batteries. They will use domestic  supply for  the EV powertrain. The inverter and the chassis skateboard  design for  the batteries will be sourced in the U.S. Unfortunately,  ELMS cannot go  fully domestic yet, but is hoping to transition as much  as possible in  the future. Right now, they are also focused on making  sure they can get  an attractive and affordable price point to its  customers. \u201cHey, made  in America. Made in Mishawaka. Half of it\u2019s  American,\u201d he said. \u201cOur  engineers are here. The software guys. The  homologation is all based in  Auburn Hills \\[Michigan\\]. We plan to source  the majority of our EV  systems and componentry here in the U.S.    \u201cYou\u2019ll be going into the  FedExes, Walmarts, all these guys. I\u2019d say  there\u2019s a low chance to sell  them a Chinese truck,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cBut  after we\u2019re finished, it should  be looked at as just a few parts from  China. If we move all the way  into vertical integration, we\u2019re like  everybody else. I\u2019m not sure we  can hang onto that price point.\u201d  So as  we can see, there is some  strategy here at play in order to secure  some of these early and first  mover advantage contracts.\n\n# VII. Technical Analysis\n\nHad  to delete this because reached max character limit. Pretty much  nothing  overly bearish or bullish. FIII broke below resistance the past  2 days  of the 55 EMA, so this week we will look for it to rise above  it and  turn it from resistance back into support.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img vek58v2fhph61...*\n\n# VIII.

        "selftext": "  \n\n**Microvast DD &amp; catalysts** \n\nFirst off well done to anyone who got in on this trade. It\u2019s been a long hold for a lot of people, if you were lucky enough to spot my DD early last week you could have got in at a very nice price. \n\nFollowing on from my DD post on Sunday I want to talk about what now know from the investor presentation and also discuss what catalysts Microvast have coming up. I think you will like what I have to say.\n\n**Takings from Microvast investors Presentation** \n\nHave been looking forward to seeing this document for 3 months now and it didn\u2019t disappoint, we need to give big Credit to Stephen Vogel, the Tuscan team and the sponsor InterPrivate for delivering but now it\u2019s time to focus on Microvast. I\u2019ve linked a copy of the presentation and investors call below but here are my key takings:\n\n\u00b7 Starting with the leadership it is good to see we have an extremely experienced team with lead by Yang Wu the CEO.\n\n\u00b7 Company valued at $3 Billion- this was in the upper limit of what I expected but very good, gives the share price a lot of room to grow.\n\n\u00b7 MicroVast at a glance- gives a real good and easy to understand high level summary of what this company is all about and where they are headed with a roadmap.\n\n\u00b7 I liked how they have identified new Target markets in Passenger vehicles, Energy Storage and battery components, this will serve them well in the long run and its exciting to think how much of a market share the will be able to get with a very large addressable market.\n\n\u00b7 They have best in class in battery cell technology with ultra-fast charge, high power and high energy density with a very impressive pipeline of new products and intellectual property IP on battery tech.\n\n\u00b7 Massive Contract with CNHI/FPT securing a $1.5Bn contract- this Is massive as it shows a steady stream of revenue and puts the Argument that the company may be struggling with revenues to bed.\n\n\u00b7 Customer partnerships with names such as IVECO, Porsche and OAHKOSH\n\n\u00b7 R&amp;D partnerships with United states council for automotive research (USCAR), Argonne and most Notably BMW.\n\n\u00b7 Identified $5.9Bn in possible contract revenues with visibility as far as 2025 in a fast growing sector with stable margins.\n\n\u00b7 How valuation was calculated and how Microvast plan to use money raised to expand \u2018world-class manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and Europe; total estimated global capacity of 9 GWh by 2022\u2019 \n\n\u00b7 Benchmark well against similar companies in terms of operations and valuation.\n\nI\u2019m very impressed with the presentation and a lot of questions surrounding the Revenues, contracts, valuation and growth have been answered.\n\n**Microvast Known Catalysts:**\n\nIn the short to medium term there a number of catalysts that I think will affect the share price positively:\n\n\u00b7 A date will be set for a vote to merge and the stock price will move in anticipation to this.\n\n\u00b7 I expect after the ticker change there could be a small dip in price with people taking profits, however, There is touted overwhelming interest in this SPAC in Asia (China, Japan, South Korea) by all accounts, and if true, Chinese hedge funds will make this parabolic on ticker change.\n\n\u00b7 Opening of the new factory in Germany and start of production, this is expected to happen in Spring and would be a really nice catalyst to accompany the ticker change to $MVST.\n\n\u00b7 Advanced discussion with two other Marquee Global customers which if executed could provide an additional $3Bn in contracted revenue through 2028. From previous DD and just connecting the dots I think these 4 are the front runners: Tesla, Mercedes, General motors and Ford.\n\n\u00b7 Beginning of construction for new plant in Clarkesville, TN with production expected to in early 2022.\n\n\u00b7 And last but not least CRAMER- love him or hate him his coverage of any stock gets their name out there with his large audience (HYPE).\n\nOverall it was a great day and a huge relief for everyone who has been getting nervous holding. If you managed to resist the urge to sell today I think these catalysts will make your Diamon hands even stronger.\n\nFor people who didn\u2019t get in early I still see value here given the catalysts above and the future revenue and growth projections. My advice would be to wait for dips to add a starting position with dollar cost averaging being the tactic. If the share price opens high tomorrow wait for a opportunity to buy when the gap created trys to fill like seen today when we opened above the ATH of $20.93.\n\nI Predicted a move of 50% plus with DA announcement. Short term I can see the share price going on a run Similar like what was seen with $SHLL ($40/50+) only I have a lot more confidence in Microvast holding a high price post ticker change similar to $DKNG (holding $50 well). \n\nLong-term if you are willing to hold until 2025 I think this stock will easily surpass $100 based on the current projections. I personally will be holding the majority of my position. I took some profits today and added a new position in $COUV which is another battery play I will release DD on soon.\n\nHappy Merger Monday\n\n**Links**\n\n**1)** http://www.microvast.com/index.php/about/investors",

        "selftext": " \n\nHello investors,\n\n (for pictures, please refer to the original [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/lpaf5w/up_fintech_holding_nasdaqtigr_the_next_robinhood/)) \n\nI have been sick for the past week and now I'm back on board. Lots happened in the markets, especially in the rates market, and it'll be very interesting to see what the implications of rising yields are for the risk assets. I will be posting market commentary in the next few days.\n\nIn the last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/lexatk/up_fintech_holding_nasdaqtigr_the_next_robinhood/), I mentioned that the computed valuation range for TIGR is anywhere between $33 - $47 (\\~50% - 100% potential upside), compared to the $26 stock price as of 2/5.\n\nThe stock price closed at $36 after-hours this past Friday. I want to note two very important points regarding this.\n\n**1) A good call in the short term is NOT an indicator of success for the long term.**\n\nWhenever you judge someone's investment acumen, including mine, you should NEVER judge anyone based on the success of one's short-term calls or good performance over a two-year period.\n\nJust because I got lucky in catching the ride up in TIGR's stock price movement in the past few weeks doesn't mean I was right nor does it mean that I know where the stock will go in the next few months.\n\nAll it means is that the stock is seeing strong momentum in the short-term due to technical reasons. Nothing more.\n\nIn the short-term, this could be a good opportunity to benefit from an asymmetric risk-reward profile utilizing an options strategy.\n\nFundamentally and for the long term, what you should be focused on instead is its 5-10 year growth trajectory and the **reasons** why this company will grow in the future.\n\nIf you think about it, it's relatively straightforward.\n\nSay the stock goes from $36 to $100 in the next few weeks. Is that a win for you? Over the long term it may be or it may be not. You will take the profits and reinvest into something else and keep investing forever. Those profits can be easily lost by bad investments we make in the future. The key is **consistency.** And consistency is born out of good research and sound analysis.\n\nAs I said in this [memo](https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/ju7zbi/investing_philosophy_plz_read_this/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), **results and analyses should be independently judged**. Good results on bad analyses don\u2019t mean much, because chances are, you will get bad results in the future based on bad analyses.\n\n2) **Valuations are always subjective and my assumptions in the last memo were fairly conservative**.\n\nYou can plug anything you want to come up with a valuation you want. It is important to be able to back those assumptions with qualitative analyses of the business.\n\nNow back to TIGR.\n\nI. Business Overview\n\nII. Thesis I: UI and easy access that are gaining popularity\n\nIII. Thesis II: high switching cost and early mover advantage\n\nIV. Thesis III: relatively strong corporate governance\n\nV. Risks\n\nVI. Conclusion\n\nI: **Business Overview**\n\nTiger Brokers is an online brokerage firm focusing on global Chinese investors. They allow global trading to be done at little or no commissions. You can trade in US markets, Singapore, Southeast Asian countries, and European markets easily.\n\nAnd as with typical brokerage firms, they earn revenues through two main sources: commission fees and interest income on margins/securities lending, contributing 45% and 28% of 2019 total revenues, respectively.\n\nThe company's primary clearing agent is Interactive Brokers, which they rely on to execute, settle, and a substantial portion of the trades of the U.S. and Hong Kong stocks.\n\nMinimum deposit that customers must have to maintain a margin account is $2k.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nThe company was founded by a Tsinghua University computer science graduate in 2015. It has gained popularity amongst the tech-savvy Chinese millennials, 72% of its customers are under 35 years old, because the company makes it cheaper and easier for Chinese citizens to invest in US-listed stocks. The founder was a former employee at NetEase, a Chinese internet giant.\n\nII: **Thesis I: UI and easy access that are gaining popularity**\n\nWith B2C companies, I always try to check out the products/services myself but this time, I scooped up some reviews of Tiger Brokers.\n\nOne thing I'd comment about the reviews is to take them with a grain of salt. Even if I personally don't like the app and if lots of people on media have posted bad reviews about the platform, these could be just the minority. The only thing that matters is that the app is gaining traction on average. There will always be haters and people with bad experiences with the apps so as long as the number of users is growing exponentially, we are in the clear.\n\nBelow are some reviews.\n\n\" Tiger Brokers stands out because of their low fees and all inclusive digital platform. Their commission costs of 0.08% and minimum of S$0 per trade (until the end of 2020), overtakes [Saxo Markets](https://www.valuechampion.sg/saxo-capital-markets-online-brokerage-review)\u2014who charges a commission fee of 0.08% a minimum of S$10 per trade\u2014as the cheapest provider in Singapore. \"\n\n\" This is due to their simple, clear cut illustration of real-time market data on the SGX, NASDAQ, NYSE and HKEX. \"\n\nSource: [https://www.valuechampion.sg/tiger-brokers-online-brokerage-review](https://www.valuechampion.sg/tiger-brokers-online-brokerage-review)\n\n\" **Exposure to different markets &amp; instruments with just one account.** (Singapore, US, Hong Kong, Australia &amp; China stock market, Futures (soon), Warrants &amp; Options) \"\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nSource: [https://nomoneylah.com/2020/10/30/tiger-brokers-review/](https://nomoneylah.com/2020/10/30/tiger-brokers-review/)\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nSource: [https://www.singsaver.com.sg/blog/tiger-brokers-review](https://www.singsaver.com.sg/blog/tiger-brokers-review)\n\nUI\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nSource: [https://betterspider.com/tiger-brokers-review/](https://betterspider.com/tiger-brokers-review/)\n\nAt first glance, I think the app is not too different from the US counterparts in terms of the UI. One thing that differentiates the app from Robinhood is that it's got fundamentals data available.\n\nBased on the below graphs, we know that the platform is certainly appealing to the audience.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nIf you noticed in the graph, while the total number of customer accounts has been growing, # of customers with deposits is only about 1/6 of the total number of accounts.\n\nThis gap is due to the process involving account verification, submitting official government identity documents, and transferring US dollars to their accounts (more on this later).\n\nIn other words, the rising customer accounts are backlogs of customer accounts with deposits.\n\nHowever, the management said during the earnings call that they are focusing heavily on an international expansion strategy, with international funded accounts expected to account for more than 50% of paying clients in the next 12 to 24 months.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nThis is also an important metric to look out for. As long as we see more ammo in their customers' accounts, we can expect to see higher trading volumes in the coming future.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nWe should also continue to monitor this metric since the company directly derives its revenues from trading volume.\n\nIII: **Thesis II: high switching cost and early mover advantage**\n\nI don't totally understand how it works with opening an account in China and actually trading in the account but based on readings, it seems that it is relatively more difficult to do it compared to the US.\n\nIt is also apparent that Tiger Brokers makes it easier to do the whole process for the users.\n\nIt has been difficult for mainland Chinese investors to buy stocks on Hong Kong or US-based exchanges because the regulations designed to control the value of the Chinese currency limit the purchase of foreign currency up to $50k per person per year.\n\nTiger Brokers bypassed the need to obtain a Chinese brokerage license, the supply of which is very tight, and allowed its users to trade in US-listed equities. It also requires its users to acquire dollars on their own and transfer them to Tiger's offshore brokerage entities to be able to trade in the US equities.\n\nAll of this hassle creates a high barrier to entry for potential competitors as it is legally difficult to invest in global equities in China.\n\nThere are still risks from competition such as Futu Holding, which also focuses on Chinese investors. I will talk about that in the Risks section.\n\nIt is also one of the earlier movers in the industry. Futu and Tiger are the two fastest-growing brokerages focused on Chinese consumers.\n\nIV: **Thesis III: relatively strong corporate governance**\n\nAs with any company, it is critical to look at how the management is incentivized.\n\nAt first glance, the management's goals are aligned with shareholders given their 18% ownership in the company.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nI briefly mentioned about the founder's background but here are the details from the annual reports. I think it's worth going over them to ensure that it's not a case of a non-tech person with a major in social science venturing into the artificial intelligence industry.\n\n\\--\n\nMr. Tianhua Wu has served as our Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, and director since January 2018. Mr. Wu is the founder and CEO of Ningxia Rongke since June 2014. Between 2005 and 2014, Mr. Wu served at Youdao of NetEase Inc., where he was responsible for core search. Mr. Wu has received many honors in the business world. He was awarded \u201cEntrepreneurial Elite under 35\u201d in 2016 and \u201c40 Business Elites under 40 in China\u201d in 2017. He currently serves as a director for Ningxia Haozhong Management Consulting Center LLP and Beijing Yian Management &amp; Consulting Co., Ltd. Mr. Wu obtained both bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in computer science and technology from Tsinghua University.\n\nMr. John Fei Zeng has served as our Chief Financial Officer since October 2018. Between 2010 and 2012, Mr. Zeng worked at the equity sales team of CICC. Between 2012 and 2015, he worked as a Director at UBS Global Capital Market. From 2015 to 2018, he served as an Executive Director in Equity Capital Markets (ECM) at Goldman Sachs, where he was the ECM captain for China fintech and healthcare sectors. Mr. Zeng obtained a B.S. degree in business administration from the University of Southern California and an MBA from New York University.\n\nMs. Katherine Wei Wu has served as our Chief Compliance Officer since April 2019. Ms. Wu has over 20 years of experience in compliance at various international financial institutions. Ms. Wu served as Executive Director in Compliance at Haitong International from February 2016 to February 2019. She served as Executive Director in Compliance at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc. from August 2010 to January 2016. Ms. Wu obtained her Juris Doctor degree from Fordham University School of Law and Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree in Economics from Mount Holyoke College.\n\nMr. Yonggang Liu has served as our Vice President of Technology since 2014 and director since June 2018. He worked at Youdao of NetEase Inc. from 2008 to 2014, in charge of the technology team. From 2006 to 2007, Mr. Liu was responsible for developing the OCL Editor project at IBM. Mr. Yonggang Liu received a bachelor\u2019s degree in information management from Beijing Information Science &amp; Technology University and a master\u2019s degree in computer science from Peking University. On April 23, 2020, Mr. Liu informed the Board of his intention to resign, and the board approved his resignation effective on April 27, 2020.\n\n\\--\n\nIt seems that all the c-suite executives have relevant backgrounds and have extensive experiences in their fields.\n\nV: **Risks**\n\nIn my opinion, the most important risk to keep in mind is competition. Futu is currently the biggest threat to TIGR but other than Futu, the rest of the competitors are essentially the established brokerage firms in the respective countries.\n\nI'm not sure if Futu is better or worse than TIGR. What I do know is that both companies are high-quality, fast-growing companies and they could both be winners in the future, just like TD Ameritrade and E\\*trade or Uber and Lyft. It's not a winner takes all game like Facebook or Google.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, I would split investments into both companies, although I prefer TIGR since it's got much smaller market cap and more room for growth.\n\nAnother key risk is corporate governance. It's impossible to tell if this company is cooking up its financials or doing something funky in the background and we should always discount those risks when investing in countries where the accounting risks are higher than the US.\n\nRemember, the US also went through the whole accounting reformation through Enron and Sarbanes-Oxley.\n\nLastly, the heightened valuation is also a major risk. I am in it for the long term so the current valuation doesn't scare me but I talked about that in detail in Part I. I think it's more important \"that\" you get in on the investment rather than \"when\" you get in, but that's a personal preference.\n\nVI: **Conclusion**\n\nThe company has clear tailwinds, including rising disposable income of Chinese households, increasing the proportion of Chinese millennials who are interested in buying US stocks, and greater openness to foreign investments by the Chinese government.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nI believe the company will grow at least 10x, if not 50x, in the next ten years and it is one of my favorite picks at the moment.\n\nUpstart holdings will be next. It is a cloud-based lender in the US and I'm just as exciteted for this company as I am for TIGR.\n\nFor those interested in signing up for the email distribution list, here is the [link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1HZ56NtaQYCsOmiCwQjHOQJvTlN-1bGm02GrqVxt6qQc/edit).

        "selftext": "Hello  All, this is my first DD. It is long but I hope you will enjoy it.    Read this all or you will die. I  wanted to do an in-depth dive into the   company Forum Merger 3 who is  merging with Electric Last Mile   Solutions, an EV company    specializing  in last mile delivery and work   vans. ELMS will be the first    and only  Class 1 electric vehicle on   the market, coming as early as   Q3,  with  no other Class 1 EV as   competition. They are also bringing a   Class  2  EV truck to market   next year. A key factor in allowing ELMS to   be   first to market in   Class 1 is the fact that they are taking over  the   old  Hummer plant   in Indiana. Additionally, they have the luxury of    working  with an   already successful EV company, allowing for instant     transposition of   truck plans ready for production.\n\nELMS    has intrigued me  from the get go being an EV company, yet it has      received little to no  attention which is reflected in the current  stock     price. There has been  little to no movement on the stock  other than     some sideways and  downwards action, which is atypical  behavior for   most   EV companies. So what  gives?\n\nAfter     doing some digging, it appears that the main concern holding   back     most investors back from committing to this great company is their       connection and relations to (((CHINA))), which comes by way of a       company in particular called Sokon Automotive.This concern is not       unwarranted, as ties to China have been an issue of concern in the       market lately. As investors, especially when dealing with new companies,       we want maximum transparency, which seems almost impossible any   time     we're dealing with a Chinese company. However, as my research   has   shown,  the ELMS relationship with China is nothing to be   concerned   about. In   fact, it is quite the opposite \u2013 something that   will help   propel them   forward and accelerate their process through   previously   successfully   developed truck plans and numerous industry   connections.\n\nI.  The Team\n\nFirst,      let's take a look at who is behind the team. As we have come  to    know,  a  company is only as good as the team behind it. The team behind     ELMS  is an   All-Star cast of players in the auto industry with   years  of   experience  and accomplishments.  After looking into each of   the  team   members, some  interesting connections emerged amongst  them  and  amongst   different   auto/EV companies(including a  connection to  Tesla)  . These   connections  made some of the pieces  start to fall  into  place. In   particular, I  wanted to figure out  more so their  connection  to the   Chinese players.  Was it sketchy and  something to  be concerned  about?   After digging deeper  my questions  were answered.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nThe Allstars\n\n***The Allstars*** ***-***\n\n**James (Jim) Taylor** \u2013 35+ years experience \u2013 CEO and Founder of ELMS, former executive at **Karma**. Former CEO of **Workhorse,**       he pivoted the company\u2019s focus from the electrification of cars  and      SUVs to medium duty commercial trucks. Former CEO of SF Motors,  now   known as Seres(owned by Sokon, the company they are working  with).      Worked at **General Motors**, serving as President of **Cadillac** and CEO of **Hummer**.       Led the design and technology upgrading of the new model of    Cadillac,    which contributed to the revival of the brand. This guy is    the    powerhouse behind ELMS. James knows what it takes to build a    company and    what it takes to pivot to the emerging world of  EVs. He    probably has    some of the most experience of anyone in the industry    when it comes  to   EVs, having worked on both Karma (with Henrik  Fisker  of FSR) and    Workhorse which we all know. His innovation and    experience on developing    different types of EVs, will allow for    future design and build    improvements. Jim, also Canadian, is known as    \u201cThe Great One\u201d when it    comes to the EV world. He is also known as    Jim \u201cThe EV Man\u201d Taylor,    because like the show Home Improvement,  he   is always building and    innovating in the garage.\n\n**Jason Luo** \u2013 25+ years experience -  Executive Chairman and Co-Founder of ELMS. Former CEO of Key Safety Systems, **Ford** China and **Accuride**.        Jason served for nearly a decade as CEO of Key Safety Systems  (now      Joyson Safety Systems), one of the largest automotive safety    companies    in the world.  Oversaw the company\u2019s acquisition of Takata    Corporation    for $1.6 billion. Jason currently serves on the board  of   directors of    Accuride, Elo Touch Solutions, ATCDrivetrain and    Sybridge  Technologies.    He has extensive experience in the automotive    world and  more   importantly with large companies. In addition he  has   been  through a few   different mergers and acquisitions which is  an   added  benefit. He knows   what it takes to come out on top.\n\n**Shauna McIntyre, -** 20+ years **-** CEO, Sense Photonics, Inc. (LiDAR) and Former program lead, **Google** automotive services, **Alphabet**,       Inc .  She previously led Google\u2019s automotive services program,     during   which time she released Google products, including Google  Maps,    into   automakers\u2019 new vehicle models. Since 2019, she has  served on    the Board   of Directors of Lithia Motors, the world's 3rd  largest  auto   dealer.   One  interesting piece of info I found is that  she is  the   co-founder of a   group called **The North American Council for Freight Efficiency**       (NACFE). They focus specifically on turning the transportation      industry  into a more economical and EV friendly space. One video I      found on  their group website was called \u201cHigh-Potential Regions for      Electric  Truck Deployments\u201d. It talked about geographical areas they      want to  focus on and develop \u2013 one of them being the Great Lakes.   Guess    where  the new ELMS factory will be? Right around the Great   Lakes.     This group  puts out monthly newsletters and events , so she   can use    this board as a  means to spread the word throughout the   industry.    Interestingly enough,  this group just started running an   EV truck demo    for data collection  and analytics, and two of the   companies already    involved are  Lightning E-motors and  Workhorse.\n\n**Richard Peretz, -** 40+ years **-**  Former CFO, **United Parcel Service (UPS)**,        during which time he opened UPS operations in China. Richard also       helped expand the company\u2019s international  footprint in many   European     and Asian countries. You can bet that this will help ELMS   get some     international connections. Hes overseen numerous   acquisitions, as well     as being a leading member of the team that   managed UPS\u2019s IPO in 1999,   at   the time the largest in U.S. history.   He is no stranger to     understanding what it takes to make a new   operation a successful one.\n\n**Brian Krzanich, -** 25+ years -  CEO, CDK Global (one of the biggest technologies for dealerships) and Former CEO, **Intel Corporation**.       Oversaw the acquisition of companies such as autonomous driving      company  Mobileye. This guy is a pimp daddy. He was forced to resign      from Intel  because he got caught having a relationship with an      employee. You could  say she really turned his software into hardware!      Brian currently serves  on the boards of amsAG and Footprint US      (sustainable technology). He  previously served on the Boards of Deere      &amp; Company and Semiconductor  Industry Association, as well as      serving as the Chair of the FAA Drone  Advisory Committee. He is the go      to guy for the chips and computers for  the vehicles. This will  help     with any autonomous driving they have  planned, as well as  their on     board ELMS-AIR system (more on this later).\n\n**Neil Goldberg**,      - 45+ yrs \u2013 Director of Forum,  Chairman and CEO, Raymour &amp;      Flannigan Furniture and Holdings. Many  years of retailing,     merchandising  and general management experience.\n\n**David Boris \u2013**      30+ years - Co-CEO and CFO, Forum  Merger III Corporation. Has been      involved in approximately 20 merger transactions as a board member,      underwriter and M&amp;A advisor.    Director of Tattooed Chef,  Inc.,     which completed its merger with Forum  Merger II Corporation  in  October    2020. TTCF has done suprisingly well,  despite it being  one  company   that I  was not fond of due to my nutrition  background. I   think the   food itself  is over priced crap but it has held  steady  in  price ever   since merger  completion. This bodes well for  ELMS.\n\nThe Players\n\n***Other Members of the Team*** ***-***\n\n***Jerry Hu***      \u2013 25+ years - COO , Safety  expert, global operation leadership and     Asia  head for Key Safety  Systems, commercial leadership and other     management  at **Accuride** and **Volkswagen.**\n\n***Justin Prann*** \u2013 15+ years \u2013 CCO , National VP of Sales and Service for **Mahindra Automotive** North America (in the running for the USPS contract), senior positions within **BMW** North America.\n\n***Kev Adjemian*** **\u2013** 20+ years \u2013 CTO, Global Head of Battery Cells at **Fiat** **Chrysler** Automobiles and VP of Powertrain and EV Systems, including OTA, at **Karma**. Fuel cell, battery and electric powertrain R&amp;D leadership at **Nissan.**\n\n***Albert Li*** \u2013 20+ years - CFO of EV startup Byton(led by Carsten Breitfeld , the now ceo of Farraday Future), and **Ford** China, senior positions at Bombardier in charge of aerospace operations in China.\n\n***Benjamin Wu***      \u2013 15+ years \u2013 GC, Chief Legal  Officer and Administration    head   for    Meridian, with extensive  experience in M&amp;A and international      corporate transactions for both  private and public companies.\n\nSo      as we can, see this team is ridiculously good and has excellent       connections that run deep, not only in the US , but in China, and  other      places around the world. The fact that the Chinese companies  that  are     connected with the team include the likes of Ford and UPS,  tell  me   that   there is a legitimacy to their business dealings.  This team    covers many   bases that are necessary for ELMS to be a top  contender  in   the ev  world.  These players have tons of experience,  have held  top   level  positions at  top tier companies, and have the  knowledge  and   know-how in  many  different aspects of electric  vehicles and the    industry overall.\n\nII. What Does ELMS Do?\n\nNow      that we know who ELMS is , lets take a look at what exactly they     do.ELMS offers the only Class 1 EV in an underserved commercial      delivery  industry.  Some of the advantages ELMS has over other EV     companies  include:\n\n\u25aaFirst and     Only Class 1 .  The fact that they are a first mover is  absolutely HUGE     for  establishing themselves and cashing in on the  opportunity of     being alone  in the field.\n\n\u25aaFactory in Indiana already kitted out for EV production\n\n\u25aaCars ready by Q3 of this year. Most EV companies aren't on the road until 2022 and later\n\n\u25aaLowest total cost of ownership in Class 1\n\n\u25aaAlready proven successful product based off top selling 2020 EV model in China\n\nHere is a pretty chart comparing them to some competitors. Note \u2013 this is from December so it may have changed some since.\n\nOnly Class 1 - no other competition\n\nThe      ELMS Urban Delivery van costs the same or cheaper as its  gasoline      counterparts ($32,500-7500 credit =$25k),  but has 35% more  cargo   space   ,  at 170 cubic ft, and a cheaper total cost of ownership by    35% (50%    compared to a class 2). The cost per year comes to around    $1550 for   ELMS  Urban Delivery vs $4000 for a regular gas Class 1. It    becomes   even  cheaper when you factor in the extra cargo volume per    cubic ft   that it  provides.The 2022 Class 2/3 model will have 218ft.   It  appears   that they  have plans to make different variations of   their  Class 1  and  Class 3,  being able to turn them into Class 2s as   well  based off   individual  needs. They will have a range of 150 to   200 miles  and be   capable of a  full recharge in as little as two   hours. These  types of   vans are used in  many capacities of our   society. For example,  delivery   and ecommerce  (Amazon, Fedex, DHL),   communications (Verizon,    Comcast), small  businesses (local flower   shop, food trucks), and    utility and local  municipality vehicles.   There is no lack of demand for    these types of  vehicles.\n\nA    cool  feature that will  probably be a huge sales point for ELMS   that  I   think has been  overlooked, is that they will be upfitting the    vans   themselves.  Upfitting is the process of taking the vehicle to  a     specialist to be  equipped to meet the specific needs of that   business.    This includes  things like installing custom drawers and   cabinets,    shelving, lighting,  power supplies, etc. The typical   upfitting process    involves a 3rd party  vendor or sometimes numerous   different ones, and    takes on avg 130-140  days from order to   delivery. The ELMS custom  upfitting process allows  for :\n\n\u25aa \\~25% reduction time from order to delivery\n\n\u25aa One warranty single point of contact for customer\n\n\u25aa   Total vehicle value chain cost reduced by 5+%ELMS are also  currently     in  talks with the leading upfitter brands IVS, Adrian Steel,  and    Auto   Truck Group.\n\nI have found no other EV that has said they will be doing something like this yet.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nCustom Upfitting for any business needs. Takes out the need for 3rd party.\n\nNext,    the ELMS vehicles will be connected with a system called ELMS -AIR,    an  over-the-air programming system. I have not been able to find  much      information about any specifics except for some clues in their     investor   presentation.  They will use these over-the-air data systems     in   partnership with the industry leading Geotab to provide many     benefits  to  their customers. Some areas that will be serviced include :\n\n\u25aaProductivity - accurate arrival and departure times ,true trip miles\n\n\u25aaOptimization - increase energy efficiency, record powertrain diagnostics, vehicle maintenance\n\n\u25aaCompliance - electronic driver logs, tax reporting, vehicle inspection reports\n\n\u25aaExpandability - system integration, hardware add-ons &amp; software add-ins\n\nSome      of the obvious benefits of a type of system, like we see in  Tesla    for   example, are the ability for the software updates to happen      frequently  and easily, along with data  constantly being in      communication with the  main servers. The more data that is able to be      collected, the better  optimized these services and vehicles can be.    The   experience and  knowledge of BigPoppa Brian Krzanich from Intel    will    be valuable in  this aspect. What we will end up seeing with a    system   like this is more  and more areas of value for the companies    buying it.   For example, there  will be savings from being able to    easily collect   accurate tax data and  driving logs from the drivers.    Time will also be   saved with something  such as the automated  updates   and knowing exactly   when a van will need  to be serviced or   inspected.  As time goes on and   more data becomes  collected, the   ELMS-AIR  service will only prove to  be  more valuable for  both the   company and  their customers.\n\nIII. Sales and Financials\n\nThe      ELMS team has  $250 million in trust, and $155M PIPE in  connection     with  the merger. ELMS will have a  $1.4billion enterprise  value at     closing.  The ELMS team is expected to have $379 million of  cash to     fund  operations and growth. They have said that no additional   capital     requirements are needed after close to achieve positive cash   flow.     With  their $379 million cash minus $150mill in debt, that  gives  us    $229  million in net cash to work with. There are a total  of     142,500,000  shares. Current market cap at the share price of  $12, gives     us $1.71  billion.\n\nELMS     currently has 30,000  pre-orders for its delivery van,  representing  a    revenue of $1billion.  They expect another 30,000 to  60,000  orders by    the middle of 2021. Some  of the companies they are in   talks with or    have preorders from already,  include: Penske, Cox +   Siemens (cant  make   that up), Merchants,  Enterprise, IVS, and others.   These  contracts   will work directly with  companies such as Ikea,  Best  Buy,  Walmart,   Fedex, Ryder and more. The  experience and  connections of   the team will   no doubt lead to more  contracts in the  future.\n\nThe  ELMS  business plan  includes a conservative volume ramp, with     approximately  4,000  vehicles expected to be delivered by the fourth     quarter of 2021,   accelerating to approximately 19,000 deliveries in     2022, and   approximately 35,000 deliveries in 2023. \u201cOur team     collectively has   decades of experience launching vehicles for global     OEMs, and so  while  the facility has an annual production capacity of     100,000  units, we are  deliberately conservative in our initial  volumes    so  that we can be  laser-focused on quality and, as a new  brand,     establishing an excellent  reputation with our customers.\u201d\n\nI   have seen some grumblings about the fine print of the 30,000      preorders  being \u201ccontingent upon satisfaction of customer      requirements.\u201d As you  will see shortly, this is a successful and more      than satisfactory  vehicle and has been proven to be so based off its      Chinese sales all  year. I have zero doubt that this team will give   the    customers  everything they want and then some. If anything, I   would    expect the ELMS  vehicles be even better than their Sokon   counterpart.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nCompanies ELMS is in talks with or has pre-orders from.\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*Put on your tinfoil hat and sunglasses and follow me real quick\\*\\*\\***\\*\n\n*THEORY #1*: ELMS will receive a future contract due to its relation to the new **Secretary of  Transportation, Pete Buttigieg**.       Before his run for president last year, good ole Petey boy was the       mayor of South Bend, Indiana. He has been known to have very mixed       results there in terms of popularity, but he did put an emphasis  on      creating more jobs and projects to rebuild the area. Guess where  the  new     ELMS factory is located? Yup, literally right next to  South Bend  in    the  bordering town of Mishikawa. Could it be possible  that ELMS  will    have  first priority now for any new government  contracts  relating to  EV   delivery or services, or maybe additional   funding/credits? Quite   possibly. We all know of Biden's plan to   electrify the US, and now Mayor    Pete has a perfect opportunity to   give back to his hometown and bring     more jobs and prosperity to   South Bend and the surrounding areas.  And  as a matter of fact, Pete   Buttigieg  actually held a campaign rally  at  the ELMS(Hummer) factory   last year. This means ELMS are 100% on his    radar.\n\n*THEORY #2*:      This picture right here was mentioned in the  investor presentation     when  they were giving examples of how their  trucks will be used  for     municipalities. At first glance I thought  nothing of it and  said hey     just some random counties they have worked  with. The  Michigan and     Indiana seals make sense since that's where they  are  located. And the     California ones also since that's where most of   the former  employees   and  Seres motors was headquartered. But then I   noticed the  top left   seal,  from Fairfax, Virginia. This just so  happens  to be  right next to   my  hometown so I am very familiar with  this area.  Why  does the   Fairfax, VA  seal appear alongside those of  Michigan,   Indiana, and   California?  A  side note about Fairfax  County \u2013 it is  very  wealthy and   very liberal.  Turns out they have  quite a few Green   Initiatives in   action. Last year  they stated that  \u201cOne-hundred  percent  of eligible   county vehicles  scheduled for  purchase in fiscal  year 2021  shall be   replaced with  electric  vehicles and the  infrastructure needed  can be   supported in  fiscal  year 2021.\u201d  Just a  few weeks ago another  article   stated \u201cFairfax   County Public Schools  is getting its first  electric   school bus today  as  part of a  statewide initiative led by  Dominion   Energy.\u201d  Interesting! It  seems  quite obvious Fairfax County is  gearing   up  for wide scale EV   adoption, and wants to do implement it as  soon   as  possible. Maryland  and  D.C. rank 8th and 9th for highest rate  of  EV   adoption, while  Virginia  ranks 23rd. You can be damn sure they    will  be looking to  improve on that  number.\n\nPeculiar    section of their investors presentation which shows Fairfax County,  VA   in the top left. Could these be potential county contracts they are    working on?\n\nSpeaking of government contracts, ELMS has **ALREADY**       received funding from the state of Indiana.  In late December, the       Indiana Economic Development Corporation (IEDC), which leads the    state\u2019s    economic development efforts,  offered ELMS a series of    conditional   tax  credits and training grants based on its plans to    create new jobs   in  its factory. The IEDC offered up to **$10 million** in conditional tax credits and up to **$200,000** in conditional training grants based on the company\u2019s job creation plans. The IEDC also offered up to **$2.8 million**       in conditional tax credits from the Hoosier Business Investment    (HBI)    tax credit program based on the company\u2019s planned capital    investment  in   Indiana. This may not be that much money-wise, but it    is an  excellent   start to pave the way for future endeavors.\n\nAnother    huge benefit for ELMS is that they have a fraction of the  typical      startup cost for EV production. The typical cost for entry into  the     N.A.  market is around  $1.6 billion. With the help of the already      successful  Sokon, which provided about $570 million of investments      already, ELMS  only needs to contribute around $160 million. This gives      them much more  wiggle room to grow and try new things.If we  compare     ELMS money  situation versus other EV competitors, \u201cRivian\u2019s  becoming     the poster  child, smoking through $2 billion, $3  billion,\u201d Taylor   said.   \u201cIf you  think $200 million to $300 million  for product   engineering,   ours is $80  million, That\u2019s really just  airbags, seat   belts and   adapting to \\[U.S.  safety requirements\\].  Tooling is already   in place   because SERES spent  $20 million for the  canceled SUV plans.   Earlier   post-Hummer occupants  also left some  usable equipment  behind.  \u201cComing   off the existing  platform is worth  hundreds of  millions,\u201d  Taylor said.   \u201cSupplier tooling  alone would  normally be a  couple  hundred million.\u201d   Well, that's a  bargain.\n\nThe institutional ownership of ELMS has been climbing recently. There has  been multiple funds purchasing within the last week:\n\n\u25aaAlpine   Global Management, bought 2,135,286 shares (valued around       $25.6million), equaling 8.3% of ELMS. One of the biggest purchases so       far.\n\n\u25aaBNP Paribas Asset Management UK - 1,665,354 shares (\\~$20million) \u25aaPhoenix Holdings Ltd \u2013 1,103,741 shares (\\~$12million)\n\n\u25aaBank of America \u2013 70k shares (\\~$1mill)\n\n\u25aaToronto Dominion Bank \u2013 15k shares (\\~$203k)\n\n\u25aaSTA Wealth Management \u2013 13k shares (\\~$176k)\n\n\u25aaUBS Group \u2013 Increased holdings by 90% to 14,418 shares (\\~$200k)\n\nWe also have in the past month:\n\n\u25aaPolar Asset Management Partners Inc. bought a stake worth $10,935,000.\n\n\u25aaP Schoenfeld Asset Management LP bought a stake worth $5,964,000.\n\n\u25aaGabelli &amp; Co Investment Adviers bought a stake worth $1,772,000.\n\n\u25aaJefferies Group LLC bought a stake worth $1,305,000.\n\nI    have not seen an official number but the closest figure I can find      for  total institutional ownership is around 25-30% . I would imagine      this  will get larger once there is an official merger date.\n\nAs    investors, we would like to see alternative revenue streams to  help     the  company grow. ELMS has plans for a few different ways to   increase    their  business. One of the main ways is that they will  produce   their   vans for  the entire North American market (CA and  Mexico),   Europe,  and  China.  Just from the Chinese sales alone, ELMS  is   estimating a   potential upside  of $300 million. The other major  way  ELMS  will   increase revenue is  through the monitization of their   ELMS-AIR  data.   They will gather and  mine all the data and services   from their    vehicles and then use this to  provide valuable   information that other    companies will want to buy. They  will also   use this data to optimize    and reduce fleet insurance costs.   This   data has an estimated upside  of   around $50-100 million in increased    revenue. As volume and sales  also   increase, they will introduce    passenger van models, as well as  rental   or subscription based   services.\n\nSome key takeaways from the ELMS financial situation :\n\n\u25aaNo additional capital expected to be required after merger close to fund initial product launches\n\n\u25aaProjected to be Cash Flow Positive by Q42022\n\n\u25aaEstimated 83,000 Units by 2025, representing \\~5% of U.S. Market\n\n\u25aaRevenue projected to reach $3 Billion and EBITDA estimated at $791 Million by end of 2025\n\nIV. The Indiana Factory\n\nFormer Hummer plant that is EV kitted and ready for production in Indiana.\n\nAnother **MASSIVE**    way that ELMS will save a boatload  of cash, and speed up the     production  of their van, is through the  former Hummer plant that they     will be  taking over in Mishawaka,  Indiana. This plant was  originally    used for GM  and Hummer, and then  once they folded it got  taken over   by  James Taylor  and his former  company, Seres.  This  plant has the    capacity to assemble  100,000  vehicles annually,  something that ELMS    will most likely need to  do by  next year. The  Indiana Office of    Economic Development Executive   Director Bill  Schalliol says \u201cELMS has    worked out a deal with the United    Autoworkers Union, which has    represented workers at this plant in    recent years. ELMS will initially    launch with 140 workers, increasing    staffing to 450 workers when it    reaches full production on one  line of   smaller vans. Within four    years, the company could have 960  employees if   it produces a second    assembly line, manufacturing  larger sized  delivery  vans.\u201d The    Mishawaka plant was selected  because it has been  retrofitted  already    for electric vehicle  production, and has a strong  supply chain  and    experienced workforce  available. Seres had already put  **$130 million** into building this plant for EV use. How nice of them.\n\nAnother   bonus that will help with the quality and speed of  production \u2013     workers  who are already familiar with the plant and  assembly line. The     land  itself is not fully used yet either, and can be  used as a    future  site  for in house manufacturing of parts.\n\nIn   addition to this plant, as of January, a new global headquarters    with    31,000 square feet of space and capacity for nearly 200  employees    has   been built in Troy, Michigan. The global headquarters    strategically    positions ELMS in the center of a network of  suppliers   and partners  and   provides access to one of the world\u2019s  best   automotive talent pools.   The  state-of-the-art facility  includes an   over 15,000 square feet   prototype  lab, where ELMS plans  to assemble   initial battery pack and   electric  motor prototypes as  well as   complete pre-production vehicle   builds. ELMS  also plans to  utilize   the facility as a customer center   where it can  work with  customers to   understand their vehicle   specifications and  analytics  needs, as  well  as conduct test drives.     \u201cIn addition to   facilitating our  growth,  the design of our new global   headquarters  will  allow for   collaboration across all aspects of our   engineering \u2013  from  vehicle   design, prototyping and software development   \u2013 and  customer    engagement, enabling ELMS to deliver for its customers   the  most    efficient and customized solutions for their last mile use    cases,\u201d   said  James Taylor.\n\nELMS   plans to   open  additional offices in California and other  locations  in    proximity to  major EV talent and development hubs\u201c ELMS  plans  to build    around 4,100  vans by the end of 2021, more than double   output to   9,100  vehicles in  2022 when the second vehicle is added,  and  grow to   83,000  for both by  2025. The vehicle and plant are said  to be **90% Ready for U.S. Production**.\u201d\n\nDid you read that? **90% READY** !  What other EV early starter is at this level? Very few, if any at all.\n\nV. Sokon Auto and ELMS Connection\n\nOk,   sounds good you say. But what's the deal with this Chinese  company     that  we've never heard of? Sokon..sokon my what?! Sokon deez nuts.  Yes,     officially called Dongfeng Sokon, known internationally as   DFSK.   They   have been around since 2003, and are well established in  the    Chinese   auto world. They are one of the top 3 manufacturers,  actually.    Sokon  has  a proven product and demand.  They have over  200,000 gas    models,  plus  30,000+ EVs sold in Asia. That equates to  over 1  million   miles  driven a  day just off their EVs alone. On top  of that,  they  were  the **TOP SELLING EV MODEL in 1H 2020**      in all of China.  Again, Sokon is no no-name company. It has a  large     customer base for  their EV fleet, and these are some  legitimate     companies that even me  and you can recognize. This  includes ecommerce     delivery for JD.com and  Ali Baba, postal service  for the China Post,     utilities for the state  grid, and shuttles for  the Hong Kong     International Airport.\n\n**Ok, so I guess this isn't some shady random backroom Chinese vaporware  company. So how are they involved with ELMS?**\n\nThis   takes us back to Seres, formally known as SF Motors, the  company our      very own Jim 'the EV Man' Taylor was CEO of in 2019. Seres  was    created   in 2016 and ended up being bought and owned by Sokon. An     interesting   side; note, one of the early members of Seres was the     cofounder and   former CEO of Tesla, Martin Eberhard. Guess where Martin     worked before   this? A little company called Atieva, now known as    Lucid  Motors!\n\nOne  thing I  want    to talk about briefly, as well, is something I have  seen  mentioned     regarding \u201cbad reviews\u201d from employees online about  Seres   (Glassdoor I    believe). This has been cited as a reason for  concern  and    uncertainty in  regards to how the leadership behind ELMS  will     function. As shown  earlier, the team and leaders we have here will   be    the least of our  worries when it comes to whipping a formidable   team    and workforce  together. Jim only started working around May,  and    Seres  had already  been bleeding cash and laying off workers.  The     combination of increasing  tensions with China and the hardships  of     trying into expand in multiple  countries at once, caused the  eventual     dissolution of Seres in the US.   I have wondered also if  most of  these    reviews were due to turmoil going  on between specific  people  in the    company, such as Martin Eberhard and  other CEOs. He  did get  into it    with meme lord Elon and that ended up  leading to  his ousting  at Tesla.    At Seres, he also ended up leaving them  in  less than a  year and he   took  people along with him to another EV   startup.  Doesn't sound like   much  of a team player.\n\nSeres   ended up ceasing their US operations, but has continued to  survive      overseas and has successful models in the Dutch market. They  will be      producing a Seres 5 and Seres 7 this year. It doesn't look too  bad  to    be  honest - kind of like a Porsche Cayenne.\n\n**Now that we know who Sokon is, and have alleviated the concern of them being an unknown entity, what can they do for ELMS?**\n\nWell,   they will get many benefits from this partnership. They get  the      existing EV product portfolio of Sokon, greatly decreasing the time  and      R+D needed to get off the ground. As mentioned before, there is      already a  demand and proven product with these models. No guess work      needed. On  top of that, they get the customer field experience and      warranty data  from the millions of miles already driven in these  cars.     This will give  ELMS a huge head start to develop and improve  many     aspects of their  automated systems and ELMS-AIR. The high  volume of     existing supplier  based contracts will be used to their  advantage as     well. There will be  absolutely no lack of connections  or reach that     this allstar team won't  be able to tap into. And then  of course, the     amount of money saved from  the Mishawaka plant and  already invested   Sokon development, is well over  half a billion  dollars. Nice.\n\nVI. Is This A Chinese Company?\n\nThe    last thing I want to mention in relation to China and ELMS, is  the      important question of: \u201cIs this a Chinese company or not?\u201d\n\n**The short and easy answer is NO.**\n\n**ELMS is an Independent U.S. Entity**\n\n**They will provide Made-In-USA EVs.**\n\nSokon      will provide the body production parts for ELMS, and CATL  (Tesla      supplier) will provide the batteries. They will use domestic  supply   for the EV powertrain. The inverter and the chassis skateboard  design    for   the batteries will be sourced in the U.S. Unfortunately,  ELMS    cannot  go  fully domestic yet, but is hoping to transition as much  as    possible  in  the future. Right now, they are also focused on making     sure they  can get  an attractive and affordable price point to its     customers.  \u201cHey, made  in America. Made in Mishawaka. Half of it\u2019s     American,\u201d he  said. \u201cOur  engineers are here. The software guys. The     homologation is  all based in  Auburn Hills \\[Michigan\\]. We plan to    source  the majority  of our EV  systems and componentry here in the    U.S.    \u201cYou\u2019ll be going  into the  FedExes, Walmarts, all these guys.    I\u2019d say  there\u2019s a low  chance to sell  them a Chinese truck,\u201d Taylor    said. \u201cBut  after we\u2019re  finished, it should  be looked at as just a  few   parts from  China. If we  move all the way  into vertical  integration,   we\u2019re like  everybody  else. I\u2019m not sure we  can hang  onto that price   point.\u201d  So as  we can  see, there is some  strategy  here at play in   order to secure  some of  these early and first  mover  advantage   contracts.\n\nVII. Technical Analysis\n\nHad      to delete this because reached max character limit. Pretty much      nothing  overly bearish or bullish. ELMS broke below resistance the  past   2 days  of the 55 EMA, so this week we will look for it to rise  above     it and  turn it from resistance back into support.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7VIII. Conclusion\n\nIf      you made it this far, congratulations. This was a journey to  China     and  back. I hope from reading this, you, like me, have become  much     more  confident and aware of the future potential of this amazing   new    company  called Electric Last Mile Solutions.  I came into this    looking   to  alleviate some of my worries about the stagnant and    seemingly  void  or  negative energy surrounding this company. I came   out  the  other end  a  changed man. They say money doesn't grow on   trees, but   they missed  one.  The ELMS tree. And it has acorns for all   of us.\n\nCome, watch this tree grow with me, friend.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nThe ELMS tree\n\nDisclosure: 10,000 warrants, 850 commons\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial adviser, this is not financial advice. Do your own dd.\n\nNote: Options just came out last week. Will be accumulating March 12.5C and 15C and June 20C\n\nTLDR:      1st and only Class 1 EV in the US with no competition. Has an     amazing   team and management. Has an EV kitted factory ready for     production by  Q3  of this year in Indiana. Has 30,000 preorders already     and expects   30-60k more by next year. NOT a Chinese company, will    just  be using   Sokon's already successful model and improving on it.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80ONLY CLASS 1 EV\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

Interestingly, swaps linked to the equity market\u2019s most-shorted companies have been outperforming relative to the broader CDS market.\n\nTake American Airlines Group Inc. and Hovnanian Enterprises Inc., which carry short-interest levels of 16% and 12% of floating shares, respectively.

The relatively limited downside, combined with the fact that retail investors can\u2019t flood the market to squeeze you, means that institutional investors may increasingly turn to swaps to express their bearish views on a company, he said.\n\n\u201cYour downside is more defined and limited compared to a stock, where you can lose more than 100%,\u201d Vinitwatanakhun said in a phone interview. \u201cLet\u2019s say I\u2019m an institutional investor and I\u2019m looking at shorting a company I think will go bankrupt. I would be a lot more wary of doing that, because let\u2019s say I was doing something and the retail community picked up on it -- my downside could be greater than if I expressed that view in CDS.\u201d\n\n### Revenge of the Nerds\n\nThe CDS market wasn\u2019t the only esoteric corner of the fixed-income world that drew eyeballs this week. The Treasury General Account -- which is essentially the federal government\u2019s cash balance -- has quadrupled in size to about $1.6 trillion over the past year as the Treasury Department ramped up borrowing to fund pandemic relief spending such as the CARES Act.\n\nThe Treasury unveiled plans last week at its [quarterly refunding](https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.mail.bloombergbusiness.com%2Fclick%2F22921697.60675%2FaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjEtMDItMDEvdS1zLXRyZWFzdXJ5LXNsYXNoZXMtcXVhcnRlcmx5LWJvcnJvd2luZy1tb3JlLXRoYW4tZXhwZWN0ZWQ_dXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3Rlcm09MjEwMjEyJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1maXhlZGluY29tZQ%2F5ea45498b17dff07e64ac4f1B8f089a4b&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cevelina_russo%40discovery.com%7Ce2c1f1ae51aa40d4d5d108d8cf3f3d7b%7C092a1ba4a4fe4172970e7ab3035e7c94%7C0%7C0%7C637487217820207249%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=R7QqSJdG2vbGGCG4J0S%2FcqZon%2FvlDgd216FVGx5R7A0%3D&amp;reserved=0) to shrink that cash stockpile to $500 billion by the end of June -- but it\u2019s unclear whether that will be possible. Those figures don\u2019t reflect U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s proposed $1.9 trillion relief package (which remains in limbo), the department said -- which means that there could be more borrowing on the way.\n\nThe cash balance drama has started to spread outside the very niche world of U.S. short-term interest rate traders. While it has profound implications for front-end rates, Citigroup Inc. global markets strategist Matt King wrote this week that there could be [meaningful ramifications](https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.mail.bloombergbusiness.com%2Fclick%2F22921697.60675%2FaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjEtMDItMDgvY2l0aS1nbG9iYWwtc3RyYXRlZ2lzdC1raW5nLWlzLWxpc3RlbmluZy10by1tb25leS1tYXJrZXQtbmVyZHM_dXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3Rlcm09MjEwMjEyJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1maXhlZGluY29tZQ%2F5ea45498b17dff07e64ac4f1Bbe2606f2&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cevelina_russo%40discovery.com%7Ce2c1f1ae51aa40d4d5d108d8cf3f3d7b%7C092a1ba4a4fe4172970e7ab3035e7c94%7C0%7C0%7C637487217820207249%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=h3CtKBDYZbR0u2MmOzN8BlQ405CK4hbRyce9E6RWXoU%3D&amp;reserved=0) for risk assets as well. Given that the funds exiting the Treasury General Account would ultimately wind up as bank reserves, delivering liquidity back into the hands of private investors could be further fuel for equities hovering near all-time highs, according to King.\n\n  \n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n\u201cThe only real debate seems to be whether this is just an issue for money market nerds, or whether it has system-wide relevance,\u201d King wrote. \u201cBoth a long-standing conviction that money-market plumbing has an underappreciated significance, and some additional empirical evidence, make us suspect the latter.\u201d\n\nOthers aren\u2019t convinced. TD Securities strategists led by Priya Misra poured scorn on the argument in a note Thursday.\n\n\u201cWhat matters for broader markets is QE and fiscal stimulus rather than growth in reserves,\u201d the strategists wrote. \u201cWe do not think a further increase in reserve balances will have a significant impact on the market outside the front end of the curve.\u201d\n\nWhether or not it\u2019s good news for stock bulls, a draining of the Treasury General Account would likely pressure short-end rates even lower as fewer bills are issued. That potential supply crunch would be hitting a market where rates are already precipitously close to zero -- to the point where strategists are [theorizing](https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.mail.bloombergbusiness.com%2Fclick%2F22921697.60675%2FaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjEtMDItMDkvcmV0dXJuLW9mLXRoZS0wLXRyZWFzdXJ5LWJpbGwtYXVjdGlvbi15aWVsZC1hcy1zdXBwbHktc2hyaW5rcz91dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fdGVybT0yMTAyMTImdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPWZpeGVkaW5jb21l%2F5ea45498b17dff07e64ac4f1B8ce7e995&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cevelina_russo%40discovery.com%7Ce2c1f1ae51aa40d4d5d108d8cf3f3d7b%7C092a1ba4a4fe4172970e7ab3035e7c94%7C0%7C0%7C637487217820217203%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=J%2B6QSunuKbYGc%2Fnd5hp8LbUNGtJagwiEW6BkCETWJKw%3D&amp;reserved=0) that 0%-yielding bill auctions could become the norm.\n\nIt\u2019s probably fair to say that the Federal Reserve desperately wants to avoid short-term rates from dipping into negative territory. Not only would that decimate money-market funds, but the Treasury also isn\u2019t allowed to auction bills with negative yields.\n\n  \n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nAs Bloomberg Opinion's Brian Chappatta noted last week, this puts the Fed in an [unenviable position](https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.mail.bloombergbusiness.com%2Fclick%2F22921697.60675%2FaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjEtMDItMDEvc2hvcnQtdGVybS1pbnRlcmVzdC1yYXRlcy1kZW1hbmQteW91ci1hdHRlbnRpb24_dXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3Rlcm09MjEwMjEyJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1maXhlZGluY29tZQ%2F5ea45498b17dff07e64ac4f1B7bc6fc1f&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cevelina_russo%40discovery.com%7Ce2c1f1ae51aa40d4d5d108d8cf3f3d7b%7C092a1ba4a4fe4172970e7ab3035e7c94%7C0%7C0%7C637487217820217203%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=NkZ0wHb%2FrZ9ybTNJJjqaWGHx8TqWz%2FnOCS1OlSmkRmM%3D&amp;reserved=0). Policy makers are likely reluctant to sell short-dated Treasuries or lift the interest rate on excess reserves, or IOER, before they next convene in March. But with front-end rates dangerously close to the lower-bound, they might not have a choice.\n\nStill, if you need some reassuring after reading that -- it\u2019s all probably going to be okay, says Charles Schwab &amp; Co.\u2019s Kathy Jones.\n\n\u201cThe things that disrupt the market are the things that nobody\u2019s focusing on, nobody\u2019s aware of. Among the nerdy fixed-income people, this has been talked about for quite some time,\u201d said Jones, the firm\u2019s chief fixed-income strategist. \u201cMarkets have spoken about it quite a bit, I think the Treasury and the Fed are focused on it, and my guess is they\u2019re going to be as transparent as they can be and lay out guidance to the market over the next couple of months.\u201d",

        "selftext": "Hello All, this is my first DD. It is long but I hope you will enjoy it.     Read this all or you will die. I  wanted to do an in-depth dive into the    company Forum Merger 3 who is  merging with Electric Last Mile    Solutions, an EV company    specializing  in last mile delivery and work    vans. ELMS will be the first    and only  Class 1 electric vehicle on    the market, coming as early as   Q3,  with  no other Class 1 EV as    competition. They are also bringing a   Class  2  EV truck to market    next year. A key factor in allowing ELMS to   be   first to market in    Class 1 is the fact that they are taking over  the   old  Hummer plant    in Indiana. Additionally, they have the luxury of    working  with an    already successful EV company, allowing for instant     transposition  of   truck plans ready for production.\n\nELMS     has intrigued me  from the get go being an EV company, yet it has       received little to no  attention which is reflected in the current   stock     price. There has been  little to no movement on the stock   other than     some sideways and  downwards action, which is atypical   behavior for   most   EV companies. So what  gives?\n\nAfter      doing some digging, it appears that the main concern holding   back   most investors back from committing to this great company is their        connection and relations to (((CHINA))), which comes by way of a        company in particular called Sokon Automotive.This concern is not        unwarranted, as ties to China have been an issue of concern in the        market lately. As investors, especially when dealing with new  companies,       we want maximum transparency, which seems almost  impossible any   time     we're dealing with a Chinese company. However,  as my research   has   shown,  the ELMS relationship with China is  nothing to be   concerned   about. In   fact, it is quite the opposite \u2013  something that   will help   propel them   forward and accelerate their  process through   previously   successfully   developed truck plans and  numerous industry   connections.\n\n# I.  The Team\n\nFirst,       let's take a look at who is behind the team. As we have come  to     know,  a  company is only as good as the team behind it. The team  behind     ELMS  is an   All-Star cast of players in the auto industry  with   years  of   experience  and accomplishments.  After looking into  each of   the  team   members, some  interesting connections emerged  amongst  them  and  amongst   different   auto/EV companies(including a   connection to  Tesla)  . These   connections  made some of the pieces   start to fall  into  place. In   particular, I  wanted to figure out   more so their  connection  to the   Chinese players.  Was it sketchy and   something to  be concerned  about?   After digging deeper  my  questions  were answered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The Allstars](https://preview.redd.it/2bs3me57pph61.png?width=989&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3d824dc0ec289199bfbf443b6a2f4f70f39199b)\n\n***The Allstars*** ***-***\n\n**James (Jim) Taylor** \u2013 35+ years experience \u2013 CEO and Founder of ELMS, former executive at **Karma**. Former CEO of **Workhorse,**        he pivoted the company\u2019s focus from the electrification of cars   and      SUVs to medium duty commercial trucks. Former CEO of SF Motors,   now   known as Seres(owned by Sokon, the company they are working   with).      Worked at **General Motors**, serving as President of **Cadillac** and CEO of **Hummer**.        Led the design and technology upgrading of the new model of     Cadillac,    which contributed to the revival of the brand. This guy is     the    powerhouse behind ELMS. James knows what it takes to build a     company and    what it takes to pivot to the emerging world of  EVs.  He    probably has    some of the most experience of anyone in the  industry    when it comes  to   EVs, having worked on both Karma (with  Henrik  Fisker  of FSR) and    Workhorse which we all know. His  innovation and    experience on developing    different types of EVs,  will allow for    future design and build    improvements. Jim, also  Canadian, is known as    \u201cThe Great One\u201d when it    comes to the EV  world. He is also known as    Jim \u201cThe EV Man\u201d Taylor,    because like  the show Home Improvement,  he   is always building and    innovating in  the garage.\n\n**Jason Luo** \u2013 25+ years experience -  Executive Chairman and Co-Founder of ELMS. Former CEO of Key Safety Systems, **Ford** China and **Accuride**.         Jason served for nearly a decade as CEO of Key Safety Systems   (now      Joyson Safety Systems), one of the largest automotive safety     companies    in the world.  Oversaw the company\u2019s acquisition of  Takata    Corporation    for $1.6 billion. Jason currently serves on the  board  of   directors of    Accuride, Elo Touch Solutions,  ATCDrivetrain and    Sybridge  Technologies.    He has extensive  experience in the automotive    world and  more   importantly with large  companies. In addition he  has   been  through a few   different  mergers and acquisitions which is  an   added  benefit. He knows   what  it takes to come out on top.\n\n**Shauna McIntyre, -** 20+ years **-** CEO, Sense Photonics, Inc.

She previously led Google\u2019s automotive services program,      during   which time she released Google products, including Google   Maps,    into   automakers\u2019 new vehicle models. Since 2019, she has   served on    the Board   of Directors of Lithia Motors, the world's 3rd   largest  auto   dealer.   One  interesting piece of info I found is  that  she is  the   co-founder of a   group called **The North American Council for Freight Efficiency**        (NACFE). They focus specifically on turning the transportation       industry  into a more economical and EV friendly space. One video I       found on  their group website was called \u201cHigh-Potential Regions for       Electric  Truck Deployments\u201d. It talked about geographical areas  they      want to  focus on and develop \u2013 one of them being the Great  Lakes.   Guess    where  the new ELMS factory will be? Right around the  Great   Lakes.     This group  puts out monthly newsletters and events ,  so she   can use    this board as a  means to spread the word  throughout the   industry.    Interestingly enough,  this group just  started running an   EV truck demo    for data collection  and  analytics, and two of the   companies already    involved are  Lightning  E-motors and  Workhorse.\n\n**Richard Peretz, -** 40+ years **-**  Former CFO, **United Parcel Service (UPS)**,         during which time he opened UPS operations in China. Richard  also       helped expand the company\u2019s international  footprint in many    European     and Asian countries. You can bet that this will help ELMS    get some     international connections. Hes overseen numerous    acquisitions, as well     as being a leading member of the team that    managed UPS\u2019s IPO in 1999,   at   the time the largest in U.S. history.    He is no stranger to     understanding what it takes to make a new    operation a successful one.\n\n**Brian Krzanich, -** 25+ years -  CEO, CDK Global (one of the biggest technologies for dealerships) and Former CEO, **Intel Corporation**.        Oversaw the acquisition of companies such as autonomous driving       company  Mobileye. This guy is a pimp daddy. He was forced to resign       from Intel  because he got caught having a relationship with an       employee. You could  say she really turned his software into  hardware!      Brian currently serves  on the boards of aemsAG and  Footprint US      (sustainable technology). He  previously served on the  Boards of Deere      &amp; Company and Semiconductor  Industry  Association, as well as      serving as the Chair of the FAA Drone   Advisory Committee. He is the go      to guy for the chips and computers  for  the vehicles. This will  help     with any autonomous driving they  have  planned, as well as  their on     board ELMS-AIR system (more on  this later).\n\n**Neil Goldberg**,       - 45+ yrs \u2013 Director of Forum,  Chairman and CEO, Raymour &amp;       Flannigan Furniture and Holdings.

Director of Tattooed  Chef,  Inc.,     which completed its merger with Forum  Merger II  Corporation  in  October    2020. TTCF has done suprisingly well,   despite it being  one  company   that I  was not fond of due to my  nutrition  background. I   think the   food itself  is over priced crap  but it has held  steady  in  price ever   since merger  completion. This  bodes well for  ELMS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The Players](https://preview.redd.it/q8j7p4l8pph61.png?width=1227&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17458efffdd343f8a5ad386b9c4411e49ef3022b)\n\n***Other Members of the Team*** ***-***\n\n***Jerry Hu***       \u2013 25+ years - COO , Safety  expert, global operation leadership  and     Asia  head for Key Safety  Systems, commercial leadership and  other     management  at **Accuride** and **Volkswagen.**\n\n***Justin Prann*** \u2013 15+ years \u2013 CCO , National VP of Sales and Service for **Mahindra Automotive** North America (in the running for the USPS contract), senior positions within **BMW** North America.\n\n***Kev Adjemian*** **\u2013** 20+ years \u2013 CTO, Global Head of Battery Cells at **Fiat** **Chrysler** Automobiles and VP of Powertrain and EV Systems, including OTA, at **Karma**.

The fact that the Chinese companies  that  are      connected with the team include the likes of Ford and UPS,  tell  me    that   there is a legitimacy to their business dealings.  This team     covers many   bases that are necessary for ELMS to be a top  contender   in   the ev  world.  These players have tons of experience,  have held   top   level  positions at  top tier companies, and have the  knowledge   and   know-how in  many  different aspects of electric  vehicles and the     industry overall.\n\n# II. What Does ELMS Do?\n\nNow       that we know who ELMS is , lets take a look at what exactly they      do.ELMS offers the only Class 1 EV in an underserved commercial       delivery  industry.  Some of the advantages ELMS has over other EV      companies  include:\n\n\u25aaFirst and      Only Class 1 .  The fact that they are a first mover is  absolutely  HUGE     for  establishing themselves and cashing in on the  opportunity  of     being alone  in the field.\n\n\u25aaFactory in Indiana already kitted out for EV production\n\n\u25aaCars ready by Q3 of this year. Most EV companies aren't on the road until 2022 and later\n\n\u25aaLowest total cost of ownership in Class 1\n\n\u25aaAlready proven successful product based off top selling 2020 EV model in China\n\nHere is a pretty chart comparing them to some competitors. Note \u2013 this is from December so it may have changed some since.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Only Class 1 - no other competition](https://preview.redd.it/rkcwj2napph61.png?width=1719&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85d0d49117764f39296c81d7c2c7a53928565fc5)\n\nThe       ELMS Urban Delivery van costs the same or cheaper as its  gasoline       counterparts ($32,500-7500 credit =$25k),  but has 35% more  cargo    space   ,  at 170 cubic ft, and a cheaper total cost of ownership by     35% (50%    compared to a class 2). The cost per year comes to around     $1550 for   ELMS  Urban Delivery vs $4000 for a regular gas Class 1.  It    becomes   even  cheaper when you factor in the extra cargo volume  per    cubic ft   that it  provides.The 2022 Class 2/3 model will have  218ft.   It  appears   that they  have plans to make different  variations of   their  Class 1  and  Class 3,  being able to turn them  into Class 2s as   well  based off   individual  needs. They will have a  range of 150 to   200 miles  and be   capable of a  full recharge in as  little as two   hours. These  types of   vans are used in  many  capacities of our   society. For example,  delivery   and ecommerce   (Amazon, Fedex, DHL),   communications (Verizon,    Comcast), small   businesses (local flower   shop, food trucks), and    utility and local   municipality vehicles.   There is no lack of demand for    these types  of  vehicles.\n\nA    cool  feature  that will  probably be a huge sales point for ELMS   that  I   think has  been  overlooked, is that they will be upfitting the    vans    themselves.  Upfitting is the process of taking the vehicle to  a      specialist to be  equipped to meet the specific needs of that    business.    This includes  things like installing custom drawers and    cabinets,    shelving, lighting,  power supplies, etc. The typical    upfitting process    involves a 3rd party  vendor or sometimes numerous    different ones, and    takes on avg 130-140  days from order to    delivery. The ELMS custom  upfitting process allows  for :\n\n\u25aa \\~25% reduction time from order to delivery\n\n\u25aa One warranty single point of contact for customer\n\n\u25aa    Total vehicle value chain cost reduced by 5+%ELMS are also  currently      in  talks with the leading upfitter brands IVS, Adrian Steel,  and     Auto   Truck Group.\n\nI have found no other EV that has said they will be doing something like this yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Custom Upfitting for any business needs. Takes out the need for 3rd party.](https://preview.redd.it/m4grfq9bpph61.png?width=1716&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77f85a1b04e12db2c92c25425567d2052f4dae97)\n\nNext,     the ELMS vehicles will be connected with a system called ELMS -AIR,     an  over-the-air programming system. I have not been able to find   much      information about any specifics except for some clues in their      investor   presentation.  They will use these over-the-air data  systems     in   partnership with the industry leading Geotab to provide  many     benefits  to  their customers. Some areas that will be  serviced include :\n\n\u25aaProductivity - accurate arrival and departure times ,true trip miles\n\n\u25aaOptimization - increase energy efficiency, record powertrain diagnostics, vehicle maintenance\n\n\u25aaCompliance - electronic driver logs, tax reporting, vehicle inspection reports\n\n\u25aaExpandability - system integration, hardware add-ons &amp; software add-ins\n\nSome       of the obvious benefits of a type of system, like we see in  Tesla     for   example, are the ability for the software updates to happen       frequently  and easily, along with data  constantly being in       communication with the  main servers. The more data that is able to be       collected, the better  optimized these services and vehicles can be.     The   experience and  knowledge of BigPoppa Brian Krzanich from  Intel    will    be valuable in  this aspect. What we will end up seeing  with a    system   like this is more  and more areas of value for the  companies    buying it.   For example, there  will be savings from being  able to    easily collect   accurate tax data and  driving logs from  the drivers.    Time will also be   saved with something  such as the  automated  updates   and knowing exactly   when a van will need  to be  serviced or   inspected.  As time goes on and   more data becomes   collected, the   ELMS-AIR  service will only prove to  be  more valuable  for  both the   company and  their customers.\n\n# III. Sales and Financials\n\nThe       ELMS team has  $250 million in trust, and $155M PIPE in   connection     with  the merger. ELMS will have a  $1.4billion  enterprise  value at     closing.  The ELMS team is expected to have  $379 million of  cash to     fund  operations and growth. They have said  that no additional   capital     requirements are needed after close to  achieve positive cash   flow.     With  their $379 million cash minus  $150mill in debt, that  gives  us    $229  million in net cash to work  with. There are a total  of     142,500,000  shares. Current market cap  at the share price of  $12, gives     us $1.71  billion.\n\nELMS      currently has 30,000  pre-orders for its delivery van,   representing  a    revenue of $1billion.  They expect another 30,000 to   60,000  orders by    the middle of 2021. Some  of the companies they  are in   talks with or    have preorders from already,  include: Penske,  Cox +   Siemens (cant  make   that up), Merchants,  Enterprise, IVS,  and others.   These  contracts   will work directly with  companies such  as Ikea,  Best  Buy,  Walmart,   Fedex, Ryder and more. The  experience  and  connections of   the team will   no doubt lead to more  contracts  in the  future.\n\nThe  ELMS   business plan  includes a conservative volume ramp, with      approximately  4,000  vehicles expected to be delivered by the fourth      quarter of 2021,   accelerating to approximately 19,000 deliveries in      2022, and   approximately 35,000 deliveries in 2023. \u201cOur team      collectively has   decades of experience launching vehicles for global      OEMs, and so  while  the facility has an annual production capacity  of     100,000  units, we are  deliberately conservative in our initial   volumes    so  that we can be  laser-focused on quality and, as a new   brand,     establishing an excellent  reputation with our customers.\u201d\n\nI    have seen some grumblings about the fine print of the 30,000       preorders  being \u201ccontingent upon satisfaction of customer       requirements.\u201d As you  will see shortly, this is a successful and more       than satisfactory  vehicle and has been proven to be so based off  its      Chinese sales all  year. I have zero doubt that this team will  give   the    customers  everything they want and then some. If  anything, I   would    expect the ELMS  vehicles be even better than  their Sokon   counterpart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Companies ELMS is in talks with or has pre-orders from.](https://preview.redd.it/6niamm8cpph61.png?width=1724&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31829ca0dab1801b3b92033ced5fb13596095a9e)\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*Put on your tinfoil hat and sunglasses and follow me real quick\\*\\*\\***\\*\n\n*THEORY #1*: ELMS will receive a future contract due to its relation to the new **Secretary of  Transportation, Pete Buttigieg**.        Before his run for president last year, good ole Petey boy was  the       mayor of South Bend, Indiana. He has been known to have very  mixed       results there in terms of popularity, but he did put an  emphasis  on      creating more jobs and projects to rebuild the area.  Guess where  the  new     ELMS factory is located? Yup, literally right  next to  South Bend  in    the  bordering town of Mishikawa. Could it be  possible  that ELMS  will    have  first priority now for any new  government  contracts  relating to  EV   delivery or services, or maybe  additional   funding/credits? Quite   possibly. We all know of Biden's  plan to   electrify the US, and now Mayor    Pete has a perfect  opportunity to   give back to his hometown and bring     more jobs and  prosperity to   South Bend and the surrounding areas.  And  as a matter  of fact, Pete   Buttigieg  actually held a campaign rally  at  the  ELMS(Hummer) factory   last year. This means ELMS are 100% on his     radar.\n\n*THEORY #2*:       This picture right here was mentioned in the  investor  presentation     when  they were giving examples of how their  trucks  will be used  for     municipalities. At first glance I thought  nothing  of it and  said hey     just some random counties they have worked   with. The  Michigan and     Indiana seals make sense since that's where  they  are  located. And the     California ones also since that's where  most of   the former  employees   and  Seres motors was headquartered.  But then I   noticed the  top left   seal,  from Fairfax, Virginia. This  just so  happens  to be  right next to   my  hometown so I am very  familiar with  this area.  Why  does the   Fairfax, VA  seal appear  alongside those of  Michigan,   Indiana, and   California?  A  side note  about Fairfax  County \u2013 it is  very  wealthy and   very liberal.  Turns  out they have  quite a few Green   Initiatives in   action. Last year   they stated that  \u201cOne-hundred  percent  of eligible   county vehicles   scheduled for  purchase in fiscal  year 2021  shall be   replaced with   electric  vehicles and the  infrastructure needed  can be   supported in   fiscal  year 2021.\u201d  Just a  few weeks ago another  article   stated  \u201cFairfax   County Public Schools  is getting its first  electric    school bus today  as  part of a  statewide initiative led by  Dominion    Energy.\u201d  Interesting! It  seems  quite obvious Fairfax County is   gearing   up  for wide scale EV   adoption, and wants to do implement it  as  soon   as  possible. Maryland  and  D.C. rank 8th and 9th for  highest rate  of  EV   adoption, while  Virginia  ranks 23rd. You can be  damn sure they    will  be looking to  improve on that  number.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Peculiar     section of their investors presentation which shows Fairfax County,   VA   in the top left. Could these be potential county contracts they  are    working on?](https://preview.redd.it/o34xxz0dpph61.png?width=610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c87eb08d3ef475c853527e9fb240fd67547a4c8)\n\nSpeaking of government contracts, ELMS has **ALREADY**        received funding from the state of Indiana.  In late December,  the       Indiana Economic Development Corporation (IEDC), which leads  the    state\u2019s    economic development efforts,  offered ELMS a series  of    conditional   tax  credits and training grants based on its plans  to    create new jobs   in  its factory. The IEDC offered up to **$10 million** in conditional tax credits and up to **$200,000** in conditional training grants based on the company\u2019s job creation plans. The IEDC also offered up to **$2.8 million**        in conditional tax credits from the Hoosier Business Investment     (HBI)    tax credit program based on the company\u2019s planned capital     investment  in   Indiana. This may not be that much money-wise, but it     is an  excellent   start to pave the way for future endeavors.\n\nAnother     huge benefit for ELMS is that they have a fraction of the  typical       startup cost for EV production. The typical cost for entry into  the      N.A.  market is around  $1.6 billion. With the help of the already       successful  Sokon, which provided about $570 million of investments       already, ELMS  only needs to contribute around $160 million. This  gives      them much more  wiggle room to grow and try new things.If we   compare     ELMS money  situation versus other EV competitors,  \u201cRivian\u2019s  becoming     the poster  child, smoking through $2 billion,  $3  billion,\u201d Taylor   said.   \u201cIf you  think $200 million to $300  million  for product   engineering,   ours is $80  million, That\u2019s  really just  airbags, seat   belts and   adapting to \\[U.S.  safety  requirements\\].  Tooling is already   in place   because SERES spent  $20  million for the  canceled SUV plans.   Earlier   post-Hummer occupants   also left some  usable equipment  behind.  \u201cComing   off the existing   platform is worth  hundreds of  millions,\u201d  Taylor said.   \u201cSupplier  tooling  alone would  normally be a  couple  hundred million.\u201d   Well,  that's a  bargain.\n\nThe institutional ownership of ELMS has been climbing recently. There has  been multiple funds purchasing within the last week:\n\n\u25aaAlpine    Global Management, bought 2,135,286 shares (valued around        $25.6million), equaling 8.3% of ELMS. One of the biggest purchases so        far.\n\n\u25aaBNP Paribas Asset Management UK - 1,665,354 shares (\\~$20million) \u25aaPhoenix Holdings Ltd \u2013 1,103,741 shares (\\~$12million)\n\n\u25aaBank of America \u2013 70k shares (\\~$1mill)\n\n\u25aaToronto Dominion Bank \u2013 15k shares (\\~$203k)\n\n\u25aaSTA Wealth Management \u2013 13k shares (\\~$176k)\n\n\u25aaUBS Group \u2013 Increased holdings by 90% to 14,418 shares (\\~$200k)\n\nWe also have in the past month:\n\n\u25aaPolar Asset Management Partners Inc. bought a stake worth $10,935,000.\n\n\u25aaP Schoenfeld Asset Management LP bought a stake worth $5,964,000.\n\n\u25aaGabelli &amp; Co Investment Adviers bought a stake worth $1,772,000.\n\n\u25aaJefferies Group LLC bought a stake worth $1,305,000.\n\nI     have not seen an official number but the closest figure I can find       for  total institutional ownership is around 25-30% . I would  imagine      this  will get larger once there is an official merger  date.\n\nAs    investors, we would  like to see alternative revenue streams to  help     the  company grow.  ELMS has plans for a few different ways to   increase    their   business. One of the main ways is that they will  produce   their   vans  for  the entire North American market (CA and  Mexico),   Europe,  and   China.  Just from the Chinese sales alone, ELMS  is   estimating a    potential upside  of $300 million. The other major  way  ELMS  will    increase revenue is  through the monitization of their   ELMS-AIR  data.    They will gather and  mine all the data and services   from their     vehicles and then use this to  provide valuable   information that other     companies will want to buy. They  will also   use this data to  optimize    and reduce fleet insurance costs.   This   data has an  estimated upside  of   around $50-100 million in increased    revenue.  As volume and sales  also   increase, they will introduce    passenger  van models, as well as  rental   or subscription based   services.\n\nSome key takeaways from the ELMS financial situation :\n\n\u25aaNo additional capital expected to be required after merger close to fund initial product launches\n\n\u25aaProjected to be Cash Flow Positive by Q42022\n\n\u25aaEstimated 83,000 Units by 2025, representing \\~5% of U.S. Market\n\n\u25aaRevenue projected to reach $3 Billion and EBITDA estimated at $791 Million by end of 2025\n\n# IV. The Indiana Factory\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Former Hummer plant that is EV kitted and ready for production in Indiana.](https://preview.redd.it/a37ay5nepph61.png?width=1097&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10c852006122b925ef4433e9f5cc61dc8b6630f7)\n\nAnother **MASSIVE**     way that ELMS will save a boatload  of cash, and speed up the      production  of their van, is through the  former Hummer plant that they      will be  taking over in Mishawaka,  Indiana. This plant was   originally    used for GM  and Hummer, and then  once they folded it got   taken over   by  James Taylor  and his former  company, Seres.  This   plant has the    capacity to assemble  100,000  vehicles annually,   something that ELMS    will most likely need to  do by  next year. The   Indiana Office of    Economic Development Executive   Director Bill   Schalliol says \u201cELMS has    worked out a deal with the United     Autoworkers Union, which has    represented workers at this plant in     recent years. ELMS will initially    launch with 140 workers, increasing     staffing to 450 workers when it    reaches full production on one   line of   smaller vans. Within four    years, the company could have 960   employees if   it produces a second    assembly line, manufacturing   larger sized  delivery  vans.\u201d The    Mishawaka plant was selected   because it has been  retrofitted  already    for electric vehicle   production, and has a strong  supply chain  and    experienced workforce   available. Seres had already put  **$130 million** into building this plant for EV use. How nice of them.\n\nAnother    bonus that will help with the quality and speed of  production \u2013      workers  who are already familiar with the plant and  assembly line. The      land  itself is not fully used yet either, and can be  used as a     future  site  for in house manufacturing of parts.\n\nIn    addition to this plant, as of January, a new global headquarters     with    31,000 square feet of space and capacity for nearly 200   employees    has   been built in Troy, Michigan. The global headquarters     strategically    positions ELMS in the center of a network of   suppliers   and partners  and   provides access to one of the world\u2019s   best   automotive talent pools.   The  state-of-the-art facility   includes an   over 15,000 square feet   prototype  lab, where ELMS plans   to assemble   initial battery pack and   electric  motor prototypes as   well as   complete pre-production vehicle   builds. ELMS  also plans  to  utilize   the facility as a customer center   where it can  work  with  customers to   understand their vehicle   specifications and   analytics  needs, as  well  as conduct test drives.     \u201cIn addition to    facilitating our  growth,  the design of our new global   headquarters   will  allow for   collaboration across all aspects of our    engineering \u2013  from  vehicle   design, prototyping and software  development   \u2013 and  customer    engagement, enabling ELMS to deliver  for its customers   the  most    efficient and customized solutions for  their last mile use    cases,\u201d   said  James Taylor.\n\nELMS    plans to   open  additional offices in California and other   locations  in    proximity to  major EV talent and development hubs\u201c  ELMS  plans  to build    around 4,100  vans by the end of 2021, more  than double   output to   9,100  vehicles in  2022 when the second  vehicle is added,  and  grow to   83,000  for both by  2025. The vehicle  and plant are said  to be **90% Ready for U.S. Production**.\u201d\n\nDid you read that? **90% READY** !  What other EV early starter is at this level? Very few, if any at all.\n\n# V. Sokon Auto and ELMS Connection\n\nOk,    sounds good you say. But what's the deal with this Chinese  company      that  we've never heard of? Sokon..sokon my what?! Sokon deez nuts.   Yes,     officially called Dongfeng Sokon, known internationally as    DFSK.   They   have been around since 2003, and are well established in   the    Chinese   auto world. They are one of the top 3 manufacturers,   actually.    Sokon  has  a proven product and demand.  They have over   200,000 gas    models,  plus  30,000+ EVs sold in Asia. That equates to   over 1  million   miles  driven a  day just off their EVs alone. On top   of that,  they  were  the **TOP SELLING EV MODEL in 1H 2020**       in all of China.  Again, Sokon is no no-name company. It has a   large     customer base for  their EV fleet, and these are some   legitimate     companies that even me  and you can recognize. This   includes ecommerce     delivery for JD.com and  Ali Baba, postal service   for the China Post,     utilities for the state  grid, and shuttles  for  the Hong Kong     International Airport.\n\n**Ok, so I guess this isn't some shady random backroom Chinese vaporware  company. So how are they involved with ELMS?**\n\nThis    takes us back to Seres, formally known as SF Motors, the  company our       very own Jim 'the EV Man' Taylor was CEO of in 2019. Seres  was     created   in 2016 and ended up being bought and owned by Sokon. An      interesting   side; note, one of the early members of Seres was the      cofounder and   former CEO of Tesla, Martin Eberhard. Guess where Martin      worked before   this? A little company called Atieva, now known as     Lucid  Motors!\n\nOne  thing I   want    to talk about briefly, as well, is something I have  seen   mentioned     regarding \u201cbad reviews\u201d from employees online about  Seres    (Glassdoor I    believe). This has been cited as a reason for   concern  and    uncertainty in  regards to how the leadership behind  ELMS  will     function. As shown  earlier, the team and leaders we have  here will   be    the least of our  worries when it comes to whipping a  formidable   team    and workforce  together. Jim only started working  around May,  and    Seres  had already  been bleeding cash and laying  off workers.  The     combination of increasing  tensions with China and  the hardships  of     trying into expand in multiple  countries at  once, caused the  eventual     dissolution of Seres in the US.   I have  wondered also if  most of  these    reviews were due to turmoil going   on between specific  people  in the    company, such as Martin Eberhard  and  other CEOs. He  did get  into it    with meme lord Elon and that  ended up  leading to  his ousting  at Tesla.    At Seres, he also ended  up leaving them  in  less than a  year and he   took  people along with  him to another EV   startup.  Doesn't sound like   much  of a team  player.\n\nSeres   ended up ceasing  their US operations, but has continued to  survive      overseas and has  successful models in the Dutch market. They  will be      producing a  Seres 5 and Seres 7 this year. It doesn't look too  bad  to    be   honest - kind of like a Porsche Cayenne.\n\n**Now that we know who Sokon is, and have alleviated the concern of them being an unknown entity, what can they do for ELMS?**\n\nWell,    they will get many benefits from this partnership. They get  the       existing EV product portfolio of Sokon, greatly decreasing the time   and      R+D needed to get off the ground. As mentioned before, there is       already a  demand and proven product with these models. No guess  work      needed. On  top of that, they get the customer field  experience and      warranty data  from the millions of miles already  driven in these  cars.     This will give  ELMS a huge head start to  develop and improve  many     aspects of their  automated systems and  ELMS-AIR. The high  volume of     existing supplier  based contracts  will be used to their  advantage as     well. There will be  absolutely  no lack of connections  or reach that     this allstar team won't  be  able to tap into. And then  of course, the     amount of money saved  from  the Mishawaka plant and  already invested   Sokon development, is  well over  half a billion  dollars. Nice.\n\n# VI. Is This A Chinese Company?\n\nThe     last thing I want to mention in relation to China and ELMS, is  the       important question of: \u201cIs this a Chinese company or not?\u201d\n\n**The short and easy answer is NO.**\n\n**ELMS is an Independent U.S. Entity**\n\n**They will provide Made-In-USA EVs.**\n\nSokon       will provide the body production parts for ELMS, and CATL  (Tesla       supplier) will provide the batteries. They will use domestic   supply   for the EV powertrain. The inverter and the chassis skateboard   design    for   the batteries will be sourced in the U.S.  Unfortunately,  ELMS    cannot  go  fully domestic yet, but is hoping to  transition as much  as    possible  in  the future. Right now, they are  also focused on making     sure they  can get  an attractive and  affordable price point to its     customers.  \u201cHey, made  in America.  Made in Mishawaka. Half of it\u2019s     American,\u201d he  said. \u201cOur  engineers  are here. The software guys. The     homologation is  all based in   Auburn Hills \\[Michigan\\]. We plan to    source  the majority  of our EV   systems and componentry here in the    U.S.    \u201cYou\u2019ll be going  into  the  FedExes, Walmarts, all these guys.    I\u2019d say  there\u2019s a low   chance to sell  them a Chinese truck,\u201d Taylor    said. \u201cBut  after we\u2019re   finished, it should  be looked at as just a  few   parts from  China.  If we  move all the way  into vertical  integration,   we\u2019re like   everybody  else. I\u2019m not sure we  can hang  onto that price   point.\u201d   So as  we can  see, there is some  strategy  here at play in   order to  secure  some of  these early and first  mover  advantage   contracts.\n\n# VII. Technical Analysis\n\nHad       to delete this because reached max character limit. Pretty much       nothing  overly bearish or bullish. ELMS broke below resistance the   past   2 days  of the 55 EMA, so this week we will look for it to rise   above     it and  turn it from resistance back into support.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qs601a6hpph61.png?width=1816&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25524d8b088c71fa32bd9a269bf3614a12ecc555\n\n# VIII. Conclusion\n\nIf       you made it this far, congratulations. This was a journey to   China     and  back. I hope from reading this, you, like me, have become   much     more  confident and aware of the future potential of this  amazing   new    company  called Electric Last Mile Solutions.  I came  into this    looking   to  alleviate some of my worries about the  stagnant and    seemingly  void  or  negative energy surrounding this  company. I came   out  the  other end  a  changed man. They say money  doesn't grow on   trees, but   they missed  one.  The ELMS tree. And it  has acorns for all   of us.\n\nCome, watch this tree grow with me, friend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img auhv7g3ipph61...*\n\nDisclosure: 10,000 warrants, 850 commons\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial adviser, this is not financial advice.

Has an      amazing   team and management. Has an EV kitted factory ready for      production by  Q3  of this year in Indiana. Has 30,000 preorders already      and expects   30-60k more by next year. NOT a Chinese company, will     just  be using   Sokon's already successful model and improving on  it.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80ONLY CLASS 1 EV\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",
