        "selftext": "Hi, I just want to get some first-hand perspectives from people who've bought $TSLA recently or are considering buying. What are your reasons for buying it? \n\nTesla had been on a stock price hike of 8X compared to a year ago, there aren't any industry-changing events during this time (the kind that AMD/NVDA went through fews year back). I mean if someone buys the stock right now, it's not that far-fetched that it could just drop back to 50% or 25% of what it is (which is still a double of what it was a year ago), while the company wouldn't even have to be doing so much worse for that to happen.\n\nWhat gives you so much confidence in Tesla?",

        "selftext": "Coda code of conduct\n\n1)\tBuy calls on the best companies in the world 5-10% OTM six months or more until expiration.  FAANG, MSFT, TSLA, NIKE, WMT, JPM, PYPL, AXP, BABA, NVDA, AMD, SBUX, CRM.  Or ETF\u2019s like MGK, FNGS, and SOXX if you don\u2019t have the capital to get in on single equity options.\n\n2)\tHold for at least half of the 6 months until expiration.  \n\n3)\tThe long term goal is to buy and hold shares.  This is what rich people do.  Hard assets that can\u2019t quickly evaporate like options can.  Same choice of companies as above.  Just the good shit. Hold assets that slowly grow. Cash gang = chicken coop.\n\n4)\tIn order to protect your winnings, make sure half of your account is shares.  \n\n5)\tUse margin sparingly.  Less than half of what they are offering you.\n\n6)\tIf you need to do a weekly just to have a little casino thrill in your life it should be less than a grand.  Weeklies are not how real wealth is built.  But it\u2019s ok if you see a strong trend but don\u2019t YOLO your whole stack.  That\u2019s just dumb.\n\n7)\tSmoke weed every day.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nSee, I got up to six figures buying puts in mid-march. But then I lost like 3/4\u2019s of my stack staying short when the market bottomed on March 23rd.  So I needed to come up with a system to protect my gains.  Hence, the Coda code of conduct.\n\nFor example, I started with $75k but now I have around $162k in shares.  So, no matter what happens I\u2019ll likely be ahead of where I started.  I\u2019m slightly out of balance because I have more options than shares.  $196k in calls vs $162k in shares.  So I\u2019m like $34k out of balance, somewhat breaking my own rule.  So I\u2019m living a little dangerously until 9/18 at which time I\u2019m going to execute 4 apple calls and 2 msft calls.  Which will bring my share total up like $65k.  I might have to sell some options so I have the buying power in my account to get this done.  At that point, I will have more shares than options so I\u2019ll be green lit to buy more calls.  This is how I enforce discipline on myself to not get to overextended.  Leverage, but not too much leverage.  Good luck to us all!",

I was retardedly bearish during the entire recovery and flipped a few weeks ago. Finally started seeing some green and was getting back to where I was in before March. And then the market tanked again and I was expecting at least modest green today recovering from the dramatic drop. Of course I was wrong and lost $7k. I'm just always late on the trend and overconfident. I can't imagine how I recover from this aside from years of saving and just never touching options again. You know, maybe that's just the way to go. There is no guaranteed get-rich-quick scheme. Please help me, and thanks in advance for anything you guys have to offer. Also fuck you and fuck me for trying to buy the dip without any sign of momentum change. And fuck SPY for continuing to drop after hours. I've been bag holding SPY $347c 9/11 NFLX $530c 9/11 and NVDA $495c 9/11.

        "selftext": "A couple of weeks ago, I posted a comment in response to a question about ETFs. This question comes up very often; usually two or three times a week. Maybe more than than.  Several people suggested that it be \"pinned.\"  I obviously cannot do that, however if a mod wants to pin this, feel free to do so.  I did make a few modifications and additions to that comment and for those who haven't gone back to see the changes, I thought I'd post it again here.  Hopefully, this helps people who are interested in an investing approach that is either made up of ETFs or that includes ETFs as a part of their portfolio.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**QQQ** \\- This one uses the NASDAQ 100 as its benchmark. Obviously it's an Indexed, non-managed ETF. XTF used to rate this one as a perfect 10.0 out of 10 rating, but recently dropped it to 9.9 out of 10. It has one of the highest rates of return over the past 10 years of any ETF. It does tend to be tech-heavy, especially with the FAANG +M stocks. (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google and Microsoft). Other top holdings include TSLA, NVDA and ADBE. (The rating dropped recently when the portfolio of the NASDAQ 100 was re-balanced).\n\n**VOO**/**SPY** \\- **VOO** and **SPY** are non-managed funds indexed to the S&amp;P 500 Index. These funds are very popular on this subreddit, for good reason. They are well diversified, broad market funds investing in mostly US stocks. XTF rates these funds at 9.6 out of 10 because their return on investment over the long term is somewhat tempered by some of the blue chip stocks in the funds. But those stocks also help reduce volatility relative to some other ETFs. These are solid investments, but keep in mind that in the top 10 holdings there will be a lot of crossover between these funds and other broad market funds that hold US stocks like **QQQ**, **VTI**, **VTG**, **VOOG** and **SPYG**. There are differences, of course, as well, but you always want to know where those duplications exist.\n\n**IWF** \\- This is a Russell 1000 indexed fund. It is one of my favorites that doesn't get talked about much. It does have a lot of crossover with the other funds mentioned above, but the mix is slightly different. I would describe this fund as more aggressive than **VOO/SPY**, less volatile than **QQQ**.\n\n**IWM** \\- for someone looking to diversify a little bit, this is a great fund to look into. This fund is a non-managed, indexed fund that uses the Russell 2000 index as its benchmark. The big difference between the Russell 2000 index and many of the the other indexes is that the Russell 2000 index looks at small and mid-cap companies, rather than large-cap companies. Thus, there is zero crossover between this one and the funds mentioned above. While this fund will move up and down with the market, it is often less volatile than the market overall. If you look at the charts, this fund has under-performed some of the other funds over the past few months while the market has been very volatile in an upward direction, but in a crash, this fund would probably outperform the rest of the market. It has a 9.0/10 XTF rating.\n\n**VXUS** \\- Vanguard Total International Index Fund ETF - top holdings include BABA, Tencent, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductors, Novartis, Toyota. This is a broad market fund investing only in companies overseas. I'm not generally bullish on foreign markets, but this one is a very solid ETF with some companies that are likely to do extremely well for the foreseeable future. XTF rates this one a perfect 10.0 out of 10.\n\n**EEM** \\- iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF - This one is going to have a lot of crossover with **VXUS**. It is an Emerging Markets ETF with a lot of focus on China. It includes Alibaba, Tencent, [JD.com](https://jd.com/), along with companies like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductors. This one should be a solid performer as long as our trade relations with China remain normal.\n\n**EFA** \\- This is another international ETF, but here the focus is mainly on more established companies in Europe and Japan. This is a Large Cap ETF that includes companies like Nestle SA, Roche, Toyota, Novartis and AstraZeneca.\n\n**S*****ector fund ETFs:***\n\n**ICLN**/**TAN/FAN** \\- These funds are clean/renewable energy ETFs. **ICLN** is more broad while **TAN** focuses more specifically on solar energy and **FAN** specifically on wind generated energy. I think renewable energy companies are the future. There is no crossover in the top holdings of this fund with the top holdings of **QQQ** and most of the other broad market funds. Also, these are global, not just US based companies. **QCLN** and **PBW** are also renewable energy funds, but they also contain a lot of TSLA, NIO and W.K. H.S. in their top holdings making them \"electric vehicle\" funds, as well. No problem if you want to add that, but you'll find a lot of Tesla in some of the funds mentioned above.\n\n**ARK** **group of funds:**  **ARKG**, **ARKF**, **ARKK ARKW**, **ARKQ**, **PRNT** and **IZRL**. These are managed funds investing in companies that invest in disruptive companies in their respective industries. Most posters on this subreddit are bullish on these funds. They are aggressive growth ETFs, but should be considered somewhat risky and volatile.\n\n* **ARKG** \\- Genomic Revolution\n* **ARKF** \\- Fintech\n* **ARKK** \\- Disruptive Companies (broader market)\n* **ARKW** \\- Internet/computer/technology (Telsa is a top holding)\n* **ARKQ** \\- Robotics and artificial intelligence\n* **PRNT** \\- 3D printing technology\n* **IZRL** \\- disruptive companies based in Israel\n\n**XL series of funds**. Similar to the ARK series, these tend to be more aggressive growth funds, however these are passively managed indexed funds with various benchmarks that usually are overloaded in the better companies within a sector:\n\n* **XLV** \\- Health Care\n* **XLK** \\- Technology\n* **XLI** \\- Industrial\n* **XLY** \\- Consumer Discretionary\n* **XLP** \\- Consumer Staples\n* **XLF** \\- Financial\n* **XLRE** \\- Real Estate\n* **XLU** \\- Utilities\n* **XLE** \\- Energy/Oil\n\n**Cloud Computing** is another sector to consider. Some tickers in that sector include: **WCLD**, **SKYY**, **CLOU**, **BUG** and **XIKT**. Of these **WCLD** has the best 52 week performance. Top holdings in **WCLD** include **ZM**, **PLAN**, **CRM**, **CRWD**, **ZEN**, **WDAY**, **TENB**, **PCTY**, **DDOG**, **BL**. Many of these are likely to also appear in **QQQ**, however, they would be in very small percentages as the Cap on these companies is much smaller.\n\n***Other sector funds include:***\n\n**Health Care:** FHLC, VHT, IYH\n\n**Utilities:** IDU, VPU, FUTY, RYU\n\n**Oil/Energy:** IYE, FENY, VDE\n\n**Consumer Staples:** FSTA, VDC, IECS\n\n**Real Estate:** ICF, USRT, VNQ, PSR, BBRE\n\n**Media/Entertainment:** IEME, PBS, PEJ, IYC\n\n**Gaming/Casinos:** BJK, BETZ, CARZ\n\n**Transportation (including airlines):** JETS, XTN, FTXR, VIS\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n***A nice portfolio might look something like this:***\n\n**20%** \\- Broad market US fund such as QQQ, VOO or IWF\n\n**20%** \\- VXUS or one of the other International ETFs\n\n**20%** \\- IWM - Small/Mid-cap broad market fund\n\n**10%** **each** in four sector funds of your choice\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n*I'm not a financial expert or advisor and this is not financial advice, just an opinion from a random internet person.

        "selftext": "Hopefully, my name isn't too biased here. But I will reiterate what people talk about any time AMD is mentioned in the past two months.\n\n1: AMD's CPU leaked yesterday. And to say the least, it looks promising. Article below as I will not go into depth on this. In summary, Intel has had a better CPU for years but this looks like its changing. If priced similarly to previous CPU's, AMD will no doubt be the leader in this price range. \n\nhttps://www.techradar.com/news/amd-ryzen-7-5800x-leak-shows-a-powerhouse-gaming-cpu-that-could-embarrass-intels-core-i9-10900k\n\n\n\n2: AMD/NVIDIA battle. For a long time, NVIDIA has been the leader in the GPU battle. With the horrid launch of the 30xx series and recent leaks about AMD's GPU price to performance, its looking more and more like AMD will take market share from NVIDIA.\n      -Many retailers report not even getting 3000 series cards\n      -Huge driver issues making games unplayable\n      -Scalpers/bots taking all the available cards and reselling\n\n\n3: AMD is selling both XBOX and PS5 their Zen and RDNA chips. There is no other competition and production numbers are being met. \n\nhttps://www.pocket-lint.com/laptops/news/playstation/153151-amd-chips-xbox-series-x-playstation-5-ps5-schedule\n\n\n4. Lisa Su (AMD CEO). This summary below linked by u/Souskei about how she revived AMD is why I personally have so much faith in the company. \n\n\nhttps://medium.com/@jyjayy94/dr-lisa-su-the-living-legend-of-amd-7e0173d3a4a4\n\n\n\n**IMPORTANT DATES**\n\nAMD ZEN 3 reveal October 8th\n\nAMD GPU reveal October 28th\n\nAMD earnings announcement November 3rd (expected $.31 compared to $.14 for last year same quarter)\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-announces-keynote-dates-for-zen-3-and-big-navi\n\n\nThe next month is one of the most important months AMD has had in years. I am fully expecting them to crush it and finally be on Intel/Nvidia's level after years of playing catch up. \n\n*We don't need to bring up previous AMD driver issues* \n\n\n**My recommendations for options**\n\nFull disclaimer. I am in for 20 Nov 90C. Now let's look at Bid/ask spreads, volume, and the greeks below.\n\n\nI will only look at option chains expiring after November due to all the announcements in October. \n\n**6 Nov** is not worth it for reasons below.\n   - the average bid/ask spread is 40 cents for OTM/ITM calls. Personally I usually buy close ITM calls for the delta/theta movement as it is safer. \n   -Theta for closer OTM calls are already at .11\n   -Delta is hovering at about .5 which is okay, but preferably since its a month away, we would want it a little more. No doubt it will move up as AMD increases. But so will Theta for an option expiring a week after the announcements.\n\n\n**20 Nov**\n    -My position of choice due to much smaller bid/ask because I'm not a fan of losing money to MM's. \n    - Theta of .6/.7 right now which buys us more time. \n    -Since I plan on selling the options during early November, I still have adequate time to not get wrecked by theta and let delta move in my favor. \n\n\n**15 Jan 21**\n\n    - Another recommendation of mine. Earnings will be about to be fully reported. VOL will be high and so will the expectations. The play is up to you here. But i recommend anything over $95 at minimum.",

        "selftext": "Not sure when all the casual people will catch on, but Intel's big announcement(which was a shitty window dressed marketing power point presentation) came off as insecure, petty, and scared.  They mentioned AMDs name like 37 times, used the words \"our competitors\" 17 times, and called AMD \"imitators\"\n\nThey claimed to be above benchmarks because \"benchmarks dont show real world application\" and then proceeded to use a bunch of their own benchmarks in a real shady way...a bunch of misleading versions of their own benchmarks vs a rivals laptop they gimped up.\n\nFirst, they kept claiming the AMD they used was their \"top\" one, when there are 4 skus AMD makes better and they used a lower watt version. They cut the ram down by 20% on the AMD they tested just because too.\n\nIntel put this disclaimer on their site\n \n\" Software and workloads used in performance tests may have been optimized for performance only on Intel\u00ae microprocessors.\"\n\nYeah dude, and my PS4 runs a lot faster than Xbox One  I poured beer on, placed a bunch of magnets on, and then hit with a hammer a bunch of times. 3x faster, 2.77 more efficiency, 300% better vs the xbox I measured all the features as a vague 1.0.\n\n\nNVIDIA when they did their announcement never mentioned their rivals once. The benchmarks they showed were comparing their other products to the new one.\n\n Intel is scared. AMD, ARM, NVIDIA, AWS, are coming for big chunks of markets Intel gets its $$$$ from and their idea is to do the equivalent of \"alternate facts\" while coming off like someone obsessed with their ex.\n\nNow no one can predict the exact time all  the common people will see through Intel's bullshit, so I cant give you an exact date for you to do an FD on. Im very bullish and long on AMD.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are a couple things Intel's new thing(they cant even get their name right because all their shit is like the IG48800UX+ or the IS4800UGX or some alien shit) does well...you just have to go out of your way to find those things because Intel is too busy trash talking AMD and running their own sketchy benchmarks (while saying benchmarks are unrealistic in the same breath) instead of promoting these things as much as they should. Maybe also give your stuff names your own people can remember instead of naming it like two Star Wars droids combined into one?

        "selftext": "I will start off my discsussion using a couple of examples where investors/analysts missed the big picture and the company/stock has proven that they're much more than that.\n\n**Microsoft**\n\n\nIn July 2013, Microsoft stock had the biggest drop of the century after reporting their earnings. The stock dropped because of investors disappointment in the Surface RT laptop. They ignored the biggest elephant in the room that is Windows Azure, now known as Microsoft Azure. Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing division and it has been the major growth driver for Microsoft. Of course, the CEO change from Steve Ballmer to Satya Nadella helped but Satya's vision was all about cloud computing and it was completely ignored by investors at that time. \n\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2013/07/19/as-shares-fall-12-percent-microsoft-experiences-its-biggest-drop-since-2000/\n\n**Apple**\n\nBack in 2018, investors/analysts were focusing on iPhone X sales figures. Warren Buffett saw the big picture. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett said long-term investors of Apple\u2019s stock shouldn\u2019t obsess with near-term iPhone sales. \u201cThe idea that you\u2019re going to spend loads of time trying to guess how many iPhone X are going to be sold in a three-month period totally misses the point,\u201d he stated. His big picture was looking at Apple as a brand and its ecosystem\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/30/warren-buffett-says-he-bought-just-a-little-more-apple-recently.html\n\nLook at where Microsoft and Apple stocks were then and where they are trading at now.\n\n\n**Intel**\n\nI'd like to use the same logic for Intel. It dropped 20% after the earnings call last quarter in July. The big picture  Intel's Investors/analysts are  missing is that they are ignoring this industry leader\u2019s methodical transition into higher growth businesses and focusing solely on solvable supply chain problems ( 10 nm/7 nm transistor density issues). I will not be discussing the fact that AMD/NVidia are using 7 nm process and that Intel isn't. Also, the fact that TSMC will be on 5 nm by the time Intel fixes the 10 nm/7 nm node problems. Those are problems I'm well aware of and they have been beaten to death already. There is nothing I can add to that. I will talk about that later on but in the end as not the focal points. What I'd like to talk about and focus on is the data-centric transformation and its MobilEye division.\n\n\n**Data Centric Transformation**\n\nIntel in 2019 pivoted from being a PC centric business to a data centric business. The TAM of this is 250 billion dollars. Revenue in this business group has grown from 42% of revenue in 2015 to 51% of revenue over the TTM. While many business transitions result in periods of low performance, as firms switch focus from declining to new businesses, Intel has managed to grow its revenue by 12% compounded annually over the past four years as it better positions itself for future growth.\n\nhttps://channelbuzz.ca/2019/04/intel-emphasizes-data-centric-transformation-of-company-at-new-xeon-launch-30025/\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/08/18/put-your-chips-on-the-table-with-intel-corporation/#527d69d35951\n\n**Self driving business**\n\nIntel purchased MobilEye in 2015. It is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Intel . Mobileye has a plan to dominate self-driving. Self driving taxis and cars are a big growth business. MobilEye is in a great position to capitalize on this business. Mobileye says it shipped 17.4 million systems last year. Today, over 40 million cars have Mobileye technology installed, and its products have been selected for implementation in serial production of 313 car models from our 27 OEM partners by 2017 (compared to 36 car models across seven OEMs in 2010). Some of the partners include Volkswagen, BMW, Nissan, Ford. It also has partnered with NIO, a Chinese EV company which people have dubbed the Chinese Tesla.\n\nThe firm\u2019s acquisition of Mobileye strategically positions it to build out its driverless technology business as well. In just three years, Mobileye has experienced rapid growth, with revenue increasing from $210 million in 2017 to $879 million in 2019. Its share of automobile semiconductor sales increased from just 0.5% to 1.9% over the same time. If Mobileye continues taking market share in this fast-growing segment, Mobileye\u2019s could provide a meaningful contribution to Intel\u2019s operations, as it made up just over 1% of revenue in 2019. ResearchAndMarkets.com expects the autonomous/driverless market to grow 18% compounded annually from 2020 to 2025. Intel is positioned to grow with this new market.\n\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/ford-expands-partnership-with-mobileye-intels-autonomous-driving-business/\n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2018/10/29/18039216/volkswagen-intel-mobileye-self-driving-ride-hailing-israel-2019\n\nhttps://newsroom.intel.com/news/mobileye-nio-partner-bring-level-4-autonomous-vehicles-consumers-china-beyond/\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/08/18/put-your-chips-on-the-table-with-intel-corporation/#527d69d35951\n\nhttps://www.engadget.com/mobileye-testing-autonomous-cars-germany-104521486.html\n\n\n**PC Business**\n\nThis is the side of Intel most people immediately associate Intel with. Intel\u2019s PC-centric business is not something to write-off. There is still a piece of the PC-centric market where Intel has an opportunity to grow: graphics processing units (GPU). Allied Market Research, expects the GPU market to grow from $19.8 billion in 2019 to nearly $201 billion in 2027 or by 34% compounded annually. For example, Intel is aggressively entering the discreet GPU business, which is about 80% of the current GPU market. The iGPU processors codenamed Tiger Lake just released September 2nd. Intel poached AMD's GPU guy Raja Koduri and nVidia's Tom Peterson. Intel hired engineers and marketing experts from Advanced Micro Devices and NVIDIA, the market leader in the space, to assemble a team to develop and rollout the firm\u2019s Intel Xe GPU.\n\nIntel is also releasing entry level processors. The entry-level processors will be targeted at budget-tier laptops and fanless mini desktops when they launch in early 2021. \n\nhttps://www.nextplatform.com/2020/09/02/intel-puts-its-xe-gpu-stakes-in-the-ground/\nhttps://wccftech.com/intel-jasper-lake-10nm-tremont-atom-cpus-leak-pentium-celeron-skus-2021/\n\n\n**7 nm/10 nm process**\n\nSince I have your attention until here - I'd like to say one final thing about this debacle. Lot of people assume that Intel's problems with this are due to complacency. Its not. Its due to Intel attempting to achieve and do something others have been unable to do, which is the exact opposite of complacency. Intel tried to use GAAFET for 7 nm when TSMC and Samsung warned Intel not to.  Intel was warned by TSMC and Samsung that the GAA-FET technique is too challenging to implement at this point in time, but Intel\u2019s pride and persistence led it to stubbornly try and tackle the GAA-FET problem, until it finally conceded this July.\n\nI agree Intel fucked up here but the point I'm trying to make is that this was not due to complacency as widely believed. Intel has a lot of management problems, hostile work environment etc but complacency is not one of them.  Intel never got complacent about its objectives, but it may have gotten complacent about its approaches, methods, and processes.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/i8qrx4/intel_exemployee_reveals_insider_details_on/\nhttps://www.dvhardware.net/article73530.html\n\n\n**Tl/DR; Post Summary / Post Script** : \n\nI'm perfecty aware that AMD and nVidia are eating Intel's lunch and have better more powerful CPUs/GPUs. However, Intel is much more than that and its other divisions are what will drive future growth. Analysts and investors are missing this big picture.",

        "selftext": "Back in July, Barron\u2019s ran a story profiling the rise of Nvidia (NVDA) as the company moved past Intel (INTC) in market cap to become the most valuable US semiconductor company. The  article cited Nvidia\u2019s favorable exposure to data center, gaming, and  AI as major reasons why the company overtook top spot from Intel. Only  two months later, Nvidia is now worth $107bn more than Intel. In other  words, Nvidia is worth more than an AMD more than its Santa Clara rival.  Around the same time, AMD (AMD)  also began to see significant out-performance relative to Intel shares.  With continued momentum in the PC market on the back of its Ryzen  processors and increased success in data center with the EPYC product  line, AMD has risen 57% since the start of July. Over that period, Intel  declined 15%. \n\nIn contrast to Nvidia and AMD, Intel is disproportionately associated with  the PC. Yet even within the PC market, analyst commentary has been  overwhelmingly positive on AMD whereas doubts have surfaced over Intel\u2019s  ability to innovate and remain competitive. In the span of a week at  the end of July, Intel announced a major delay with its 7nm chips and  AMD beat Q2 earnings, raised guidance, and hit its highest PC market  share since 2013. However, the focus on Intel as a struggling PC player  has wrongly overlooked several important developments that set the company up for a near-term rebound in PC and [long-term revenue opportunities in the same higher growth end markets that have fueled premium valuations for both Nvidia and AMD](https://blackjacketco.com/f/new-brand-new-intel-growth-ahead-for-tiger-lake-edge-and-av).\u00a0\n\n1. Release of Tiger Lake processor, expanded efforts in graphics via  Xe architecture, and development of discrete GPUs for data center and  desktop\n2. Continued momentum in company shift to data-centric business first and PC business second\n3. Expanded Total Addressable Market (TAM) associated with edge computing and edge-enabled technologies\n4. Competitive positioning in autonomous vehicle technology\n\nIntel is currently priced for stagnant to declining revenues, further market share erosion, and lower  relative probability of success compared to Nvidia and AMD. Given recent  product releases and refreshes, as well as a strong strategic vision to  increase share in these higher growth end markets, Intel revenue is  more likely to accelerate and lead to significant multiple expansion in  the coming years.\u00a0\n\n* Assigning Intel CY23 PT of $125 per share\n* FY23 revenue projected at $100bn\n* FY23 net income projected at $34bn delivering 7.55 in EPS\n* Applying 16.55x P/E and 4.55 P/S\u00a0\n\nFor an in-depth and comprehensive breakdown on Intel's competitive positioning, see below:\n\n**Tiger Lake and Renewed PC Innovation**\u00a0\n\nYesterday  Intel finally revealed the highly anticipated Tiger Lake 11th  generation processors for ultra-thin high-performance laptops. Industry  reporting in previous months had speculated that the new system-on-chip  (SoC \u2013 incorporates different components like graphics and AI into one  integrated unit) would offer CPU performance advances and improvements  in graphics and AI. Intel even leaked some specs on Monday that seemed  to confirm some of the performance metrics. Although independent  industry studies are required to run Tiger Lake through its full paces,  the event demonstrated that not only can Intel still innovate, it is  more than premature to start counting the company out on PCs.\u00a0\n\nTiger  Lake clocks up to 20% higher frequencies compared to the 10th  generation Ice Lake family and can reach a single core turbo of 4.8 GHz.  During the presentation, Intel noted that the integrated Iris Xe  graphics perform better than 90% of PCs sold last year, on-board AI is  up to 5x more effective, and WiFi connectivity is up to 3x faster. In a  like-for-like comparison to AMD, Tiger Lake enabled 4x faster photo  upscaling, 2x faster video processing and exporting via Adobe Pro, and  20% faster performance in both Microsoft Word and PowerPoint. For  gaming, Intel conducted side-by-side tests using Gears Tactics. Laptops  running AMD 4800U with integrated graphics and a Nvidia MX350 discrete  graphics card (with Intel 10th Gen i7) performed worse than Tiger Lake.  Intel\u2019s test showed that Tiger Lake handled the game at up to 66% higher  frames per second versus the AMD and Nvidia-powered laptops.\u00a0\n\nBarring significant discrepancies found during independent reviews, Intel just  delivered performance on 10nm that is equivalent to what is possible on  7nm. With the simultaneous launch of the Evo brand to encompass the new  11th generation-powered ultra-thin high-performance laptop range, Intel  can begin building customer brand recognition and altering perceptions  that Intel has lost competitive footing in the PC market. With 50 PC  designs set to ship with Tiger Lake as soon as this fall, and at least  150 designs anticipated from partner OEMs, Intel may see a very  near-term recovery in its PC market share even despite the 7nm delay.\u00a0 \n\n**Transition to Data-Centric Business and Future at the Edge**\n\nMore  important to Intel\u2019s future is the multi-year shift towards  higher-growth end markets associated with cloud, edge, and data. Rather  than PCs, Intel sees its primary business as the Data-Centric reporting  segment that now comprises 52% of revenues. That figure is likely to  expand in coming quarters following 34% YoY growth in the most recent  earnings report. In FY19 Q2, the Data-Centric segment only accounted for  46% of revenues.\u00a0\n\nThat  Data-Centric segment includes: The Data Center Group (36.3% of total  Intel revenues); Non-Volatile Memory Storage Group (8.5%);  Internet-of-Things Group (3.4%); Programmable Solutions Group (2.6%);  and Mobileye (0.7%). The two largest contributors to the segment are  performing extremely well. The Data Center Group grew 43% YoY and saw  operating income climb 72%. The second largest business in the segment,  Non-Volatile Memory Storage, grew 76% YoY for record revenue on the back  of NAND demand growth and higher Average Selling Prices (ASPs).\u00a0\n\nBy  2024, Intel expects its TAM to reach $300bn. But $230bn of this is  attributed to the Data-Centric TAM. And Intel\u2019s own calculations may be  slightly conservative. In the company\u2019s analysis of its various end  markets, Intel only mentioned the edge compute market in general terms.  Yet that market alone is projected to surpass $100bn by 2030. As much as  public cloud adoption drove demand for server-related products over the  past five years, the edge could end up being a far more important  trend. That is because, in addition to further server demand, the edge  will enable billions of IoT devices to finally become widespread after  years of hype. With TAM growth associated with edge server CPU, GPU, and  storage, plus IoT and edge AI solutions, Intel can achieve growth into  the 2030s so long as the company can execute on its strategic vision. \u00a0\n\n*Edge Server*\u00a0\n\nAn S&amp;P Global study  in spring 2020 estimated that Intel has 90-95% share of the data center  CPU market despite recent share gains by AMD. While edge server  architectures and processes differ versus hyperscale cloud servers, this  figure is testament to the strength of Intel\u2019s relationships with the  leading cloud providers that are also among the early movers in the edge  computing space \u2013 namely Amazon with its Lambda@Edge platform,  Microsoft with Azure Functions, and Google with Google Cloud Functions. \u00a0\n\nFor  smaller edge providers especially, like Fastly, Akamai, or Cloudflare,  there will be particular emphasis on price-per-performance for server  components. Until recently, that dynamic favored AMD whose EPYC Rome  7742 processor rivals Intel\u2019s Xeon Platinum 8280 on performance yet  undercuts it on price by about 60%. The cost efficiency of EPYC led to  some important edge server design wins for AMD, including Cloudflare\u2019s  new GenX server that excluded Intel parts for the first time.\u00a0\n\nThe  latest Xeon processors had been on the market for a couple years,  though, and Intel refreshed the product line earlier this year in an  attempt to greatly reduce cost while maintaining performance. In its 24  February press release, Intel directly addressed the need to become more  competitive with AMD on price-per-performance noting that the Xeon  refresh: \u201c\u2026\\[reinforces\\] Intel\u2019s data center leadership by providing  greater performance and performance-per-dollar choices for\u2026customers  across cloud, network and edge.\u201d While Intel compromised on  compatibility with certain server designs, the result is 1.42x better  price-per-core-performance and a cost of $141 per-core for the Gold  6258R. The price tag puts Xeon in a much stronger position relative to  EPYC Rome 7742 which goes for $108 per-core.\u00a0\n\nDespite  early advantages in cost-per-performance for AMD, Intel still managed  to double its edge deployments year-over-year according to Forbes. And  its impressive partner list includes Lenovo, Red Hat, Advantech,  Caswell, Inventec, Lanner, Nexcom, World Wide Technology, Ericsson, ZTE,  Verizon, Vodafone, Nokia, and China Telecom, among others. With drastic  improvements in price-per-performance, Intel could very well see  additional customer wins in upcoming quarters.\u00a0\n\nBeyond  CPU, edge applications will see an increase in demand for integrated  and hybrid GPUs. Between advancements in Intel Xe graphics and its  development of discrete graphics cards, the company will become better  positioned to take advantage of the more than 33% CAGR projected for  GPUs from 2020 to 2027 \u2013 taking the market from just under $20bn in 2019  to over $200bn according to Deloitte.  Even if Nvidia and AMD maintain large leads over Intel in GPU market  share for edge servers, even a marginal portion of the market could be  meaningful to the Data Center Group which measured around $7bn in Q2.\u00a0\n\nIn  addition, edge servers present an unprecedented opportunity for NAND  solutions as well \u2013 specifically flash storage that utilizes the NVMe  (Non-Volatile Memory Express) protocol. Edge servers have strong need  for high-performance startup operations and extremely reliable storage.  That is because rapid startup times are critical for edge providers to  quickly launch computing instances and deliver the lowest possible  latency for their customers. Improvements in NVMe NAND greatly shrink  the physical storage footprint, reduce power and cooling costs, all the  while improving the overall speed, flexibility, and failure rates. And  Intel Optane and 3D NAND SSDs are exceptionally reliable for storage and  offer performance improvements over legacy storage solutions.\u00a0\n\n*IoT and AI*\n\nMuch  like edge servers, edge deployed IoT devices will similarly boost  demand for Intel processors. For workload intensive industrial IoT,  Intel has its Core processor. And the Intel Atom processor is  purpose-built for lower-power or embedded applications. Because IoT  devices will collect and process vast amounts of data, these  applications will also require significant amounts of flash memory \u2013  specifically NAND. On-device NAND SSD can increase data transfer speeds  while also integrating module-level security features, remote  management, and more flexible power configurations. Collectively,  improvements in NAND will lower total cost of ownership for these  machines. \u00a0\n\nThe edge will lead  to rapid growth for edge AI chipsets that enable IoT devices to deploy  machine learning at the edge without having to send data via internet  back to a centralized data center. Deloitte notes that around 300  million edge AI chips were sold in 2017, but this year could see more  than 750 million units hit the market. With compounded annual growth in  edge AI chipsets anticipated to outpace the broader semiconductor  industry by a considerable amount, ABI research predicts that these edge chips will surpass the market for cloud AI chips by 2025 \u2013 marking a massive shift.\u00a0\n\n**Mobileye and Autonomous Driving Technology**\u00a0\n\nIt  is interesting the extent to which mainstream conversations in media  and financial commentary largely exclude Intel\u2019s Mobileye and instead  focus on Tesla as the technology leader in autonomous vehicles and  Nvidia as the chipmaker best positioned to disrupt. Although Telsa  claims to offer autonomous modes for its vehicles, based on the 5-level  autonomous capability hierarchy \u2013 the industry standard established by  the Society of Automotive Engineers \u2013 the most advanced cars currently  on the market only operate at level 2+. Level 2+ falls between levels 2  (partial automation) and 3 (conditional automation). The hardware to  support full level 5 autonomy does exist in 2020, and the software  necessary to manage these systems is not too far behind. However, it  will likely take 5-7 years before manufacturing volumes reach levels to  drive down hardware prices, the necessary regulatory frameworks come  into place, and fully autonomous vehicles gain broad consumer  acceptance. \u00a0\n\nIn the  intermediary period, the progression towards level 5 autonomy will  continue to be gradual and incremental. Higher degrees of autonomy will  be achieved by increasingly sophisticated advanced driver assistance  systems (ADAS) that prove out the viability of these technologies and  underpin the manufacturing, regulatory, and consumer environment that  will facilitate the future arrival of self-driving cars. Beyond this, in  many cases the same technology at the center of levels 4 and 5 builds  on the existing foundations of ADAS capabilities. And the dominant  player in the ADAS market is not Tesla, Waymo, or Nvidia. It is  Mobileye.\u00a0\n\nMobileye\u2019s market  share has consistently stayed above 70% for years, even as competition  from other players has ramped up \u2013 Nvidia in particular. The Mobileye  solution is noteworthy, pairing its SoC \u2013 the EyeQ family \u2013 to support a  range of ADAS capabilities using only a single camera sensor. This  differs from the LiDAR and radar-based systems favored by Waymo, Uber,  GM-owned Cruise, and Nvidia. Tesla \u2013 who previously used Mobileye  technology until the two parted ways in 2016 \u2013 also leverages a  camera-based system. However, Tesla deploys ultrasonic sensors and  radars in combination with billions of miles of driver data.\u00a0\n\nMobileye\u2019s  commanding market share in ADAS means that its technology is used by  more than 300 models from 25 global automakers, resulting in 60 million  vehicles on the road worldwide. In contrast, Tesla currently has fewer  than 1 million vehicles on the road equipped with variants of its  autopilot technology. And Mobileye is already working with 4 major OEMs  to soon provide level 3 autonomous solutions. As part of its  arrangements with OEMs, Mobileye receives access to sensor data from  customer vehicles. At present, Mobileye is collecting 3.7 million miles  per day and growing as another 2 million vehicles from these OEMs are  set to join the data-sharing program over the next two years.\u00a0\n\nWhat  this translates to is a massive partner network with the world\u2019s  leading auto OEMs who will all have a vested interest in competing with  Tesla both in autonomous but also electric vehicles. This also means  that Mobileye has a significant advantage over Nvidia in getting its  ADAS and future autonomous solutions on vehicles. As Mobileye further  prioritizes its fully autonomous solutions, its leading competitive  positioning in ADAS, as well its strong relationships with OEMs, gives  the company a strategic advantage over its competitors as higher levels  of autonomous technologies go to market. This is evidenced by Mobileye\u2019s  strategic partnership with Tesla EV rival NIO to offer level 4 consumer  vehicles by 2022.\u00a0\n\nEven though  Mobileye made its name based on its single camera platform, the company  is separately developing what is called a full autonomous stack,  incorporating the necessary LiDAR, radar, non-camera sensors, GPS,  modems, and other hardware components that will run on its 5thgeneration  EyeQ processor. In the meantime, Mobileye recently demoed a  self-driving vehicle that navigated the congested streets of Jerusalem  using only 12 cameras and no LiDAR, radar, or non-camera sensors.\u00a0\n\nOn  the back of the hyperbolic move in Tesla shares YTD, numerous articles  have lauded the company\u2019s so-called multi-year advantages over rivals in  the space. Notably, in July Elon Musk stated that Tesla is \u201cvery close\u201d  to level 5 autonomy with no updates needed to hardware as the company\u2019s  Tesla Computer processor currently supports full autonomy. Mobileye\u2019s  EyeQ 5 also supports level 5 autonomy, however. And although the Tesla  Computer exceeds EyeQ 5 on tera operations per second (TOPS), EyeQ 5  offers footprint and power consumption advantages. Moreover, unlike most  other players in autonomous systems, Mobileye has opted for an open  architecture that enables OEMs to program their own software on top of  Mobileye hardware.\u00a0\n\nTesla has a  lead in data collected per mile at over 3 billion miles, but Mobileye is  catching up and its data repositories also exceed the billion-mile mark  on an annual run rate basis. To deepen the data sets available to  Mobileye, Intel also bought Israeli mobility-as-a-service company Moovit  for $900mn this year. Like Tesla, Mobileye is set to offer its  technology in the important robotaxi market that many in the industry  view as the precursor to consumer-adopted fully autonomous vehicles down  the line. Mobileye is launching pilot robotaxi fleets in Tel Aviv,  Paris, and Daegu City in 2022.\u00a0\n\nMobileye  still accounts for less than 1% of total Intel revenues despite  doubling sales since being acquired by Intel. Given the strength of  Mobileye\u2019s position in the ADAS market that is expected to grow to more  than $80bn by 2030, as well as the prospects in robotaxis and level 4/5  autonomous systems, Mobileye has strong potential to develop into a  major growth engine for Intel over the next 4-5 years.\u00a0\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIntel  shares are roughly flat since early 2018 despite revenues up almost 20%  from FY19 Q2 to FY20 Q2. The relative out-performance in Nvidia and AMD  shares over that time has furthered perceptions that Intel could fall  behind as the former two companies achieve sustained revenue growth tied  to more attractive end markets like data center, gaming, AI, and  autonomous vehicles.\u00a0\n\nHowever,  recent struggles with certain products and lost PC market share to AMD  have distracted investors from Intel\u2019s ongoing transition to a more data-centric business. With a $230bn TAM projected by 2024 for this  operating segment alone, Intel has multiple opportunities to likewise  drive revenue growth over the long-term.\u00a0\n\nGiven  the company\u2019s recent advancements with its 11th generation Tiger Lake SoC, continued progress in improving price-per-performance for edge  server components, and the vastly underrated leadership of Mobileye in  the ADAS and autonomous vehicle markets, Intel offers an extremely  compelling opportunity for investors seeking exposure to these  technology trends at a more reasonable valuation.\u00a0\n\n*You can find me on Twitter* [@BlackjacketCo](https://twitter.com/BlackjacketCo) *where I write about emerging technologies, industry news, and long-term market trends.

By definition, it tends to be bigger companies which are on the stock market. So inevitably the stock market can\u2019t capture the thousands of small businesses that are failing. Yet, even here, disaggregation of the S&amp;P tells us a lot. Again, there is a wide and sharp dispersion right now, with average returns for large firms a lot higher than smaller firms. This wasn\u2019t the case in February. More than half the companies in the index have less than $25 billion in market capitalization, and the average year-to-date return for all these companies (equally-weighted) is negative.  \n\n&gt;Once returns are broken down by sales growth, we see dramatic differences based on sales growth and decline. Returns are in fact highest for companies with the strongest year-over-year sales growth. Among those with sales growth greater than 20% are familiar companies like Amazon and Netflix, but also much smaller companies like Nvidia and Paypal. In other words, tech stock returns are being driven by tech sales.\n\n&gt;This does not mean that stocks, especially the ones that have really run up in price, are avoiding overvaluation. However, that is a different question. If there are overvalued stocks, it is likely caused by companies that have seen the biggest sales growth leading to overoptimistic expectations of future sales growth. Overconfidence reflects the economy and beliefs about the economy, while none of us know the future. But this is a generic point, not an argument for setting aside consideration of the stock market. Stocks with the highest valuation, as measured by forward price to earnings ratio, have in fact gained the most year-to-date.",

        "selftext": "Turns out Softbank has been pumping all the tech stops with massive billion dollar call options plays forcing market makers to buy the shares in bulk to properly hedge themselves against infinite losses. They even tried to pump TSLA and AAPL AGAIN today before the news officially broke on mainstream media and tried to pump at the end of the day because they were already tens of millions of dollars deep in options that expired today they had bought in the morning. They were unsuccessful because I assume after the news broke anyone with more than two brain cells who knows what this means was dumping hard while they were trying to pump at end of day. Don't believe me? Take a look at the volume they dumped into the 0 DTE options to pump the market, throw these options charts up and see when the volume came in, at the bottom of the drop in the morning so they could squeeze the market makers out by stacking bids pushing price higher and forcing them to cover the options they just sold. Pull out the old calculator and calculate for yourself how much it would've cost someone at the mid-price with that volume to put on these positions, tens upon tens of millions of dollars. This wasn't no regular WSB autism, this was the Japs trying to get revenge for Hiroshima by creating the biggest market wide pump and dump anyone's ever seen. \"Buy the dip faggot\" me all you want buy the truth is everyone including me thought this huge volume and buying was legitimate institutions and investors investing for the long when its really just been a market manipulation feed back loop where all the buying was market makers covering their asses from infinite losses to the calls they sold exactly the same as short squeeze. I wish I had bought TSLA/AAPL/NVDA/NASDAQ/SPY puts before close because I assume come Tuesday everyone and their mom will be tripping over each other to scoop some up as the market corrects back to or below June levels which is about when they started this pumping scheme on the tech stocks. Retail will never touch the stock market again after the blood we will soon see because you know these dumb mfs have been dumping in more money than they can lose at the top on stocks or options and that's about to all go poof. Listen to me or not I don't give a shit, I'm just here so help those smart few avoid the slaughter house and offer free tendies for those who don't already have all their money is soon to be worthless TSLA weeklys.

        "selftext": "\"The generation to generation improvement in performance, coupled with flat generation to generation pricing trends, implies an increase in performance/$ that is larger on the Ampere generation of cards than the Turing generation. Recall that based on data provided at Nvidia's various Investor Days, 98% of Nvidia's installed base was on Pascal (introduced in 2016) or older generation cards entering 2019. Based on past trends, we believe that around \\~3/4 of the installed base was on Pascal or older generation cards entering 2020. We believe this is important as a) it implies that 3/4 of Nvidia's installed base is on cards that are \\~4 years old, b) our view is that the typical GPU refresh cycle is around 4 years, and c) ultimately, we believe the larger performance/$ increase relative to prior generations could accelerate the installed base refresh cycle.

While AMD has improved execution across its client CPU and server CPU businesses over the past several years, the company has seen less success in its Gaming GPU franchise with share flat to down since 2016. As a result, we expect competitive dynamics between the two companies' businesses to remain largely unchanged, with our estimates implying ongoing share loss for AMD in the near term.\"",

        "selftext": " This is part 2 of a series on semiconductor companies. If you read part 1,available both on my [blog](https://www.infinitevalueptr.com/post/intel_10nm?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=r%2Finvesting) and [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/i73sw1/deep_dive_into_the_reasons_behind_why_intel_is/),  you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking that the future is all doom and gloom  for Intel. However, the reality is that\u2019s not necessarily the case.  Their longer-term future bears some promise. Although it\u2019s incredibly  important, lithography is not the be-all and end-all of integrated  circuit design manufacturing. Another critical part which has often been  overlooked in the past is packaging \u2013 essentially how you make the  calculations done on the transistors be transported to the outside  world. The process of making a semiconductor device consists of  fabricating on wafers with lithography, slicing the wafer into dies,  which are then packaged. Packaging protects the die from damage, and  lets the chip communicate with the outside world \u2013 as well as within the  package itself. One of the few things Intel management have said over  the past few years that I whole-heartedly agree with is that packaging,  not lithographic process, is the future. The main reason for this is the  falling benefits of moving to smaller processes \\[1\\], coupled with  rapidly increasing costs \u2013 a EUV machine to make advanced processes can  cost up to $125million \\[2\\], while the R&amp;D costs to make smaller  processes are also increasing \\[3\\].\n\nWhat is packaging?\n\nThe  best analogy for understanding packaging design is that of  architectural history. Imagine each transistor is a human worker.  Traditional lithographic improvements have been focused around making  the \u2018workers\u2019 more productive in smaller spaces \u2013 first  hunter-gathering, then farming, then offices, etc. However, we\u2019re now at  the point where workers have so little room to move in their workspaces  (cubicles) it\u2019s extremely difficult to do any more cost-savings the  traditional way. Instead, what we need to do is break out of the  traditional paradigm we have of placing everyone in one massive building  and move to more radical designs. There are two main ways we could go  about doing this: chiplets and 3D stacking\\[4\\]. In the terminology of our  analogy, chiplets are like if you split up the old massive office  building into a campus with multiple smaller offices, where each team  can work on a job that they\u2019re specialised in, or where you can cut  costs by having inexperienced interns working in one particular  department that\u2019s not too important instead of being forced to use  identical workers of the same quality across all departments under a  \u2018monolithic\u2019 , single-office design. The challenge we have is to ensure  that communication flows easily and quickly between each different  office building.\n\n3D stacking is  like going from a society where we only have bungalows (single-layer  chips, the traditionally dominant choice in high-performance computing)  to high-rise buildings (3D stacked chips, where you have multiple dies  on top of each other). The challenge we have is constructing  life-support systems like elevators, that can enable data to transfer  rapidly out of the CPU, or sewage pipes, that help let waste (heat)  escape.\n\nChiplets\n\nChiplets  are sometimes called 2.5D stacking, referring to the fact that they\u2019re  commonly viewed as a stepping stone between 2D and 3D packaging. The  most common method, the one that\u2019s widely used right now (notably in  AMD\u2019s Zen 2 architecture), has an \u2018interposer\u2019 sitting underneath the  chips you want to connect.\\[5\\] This interposer acts as a conduit between  the two (or more) chips, enabling rapid communication. Think of it as  having a concrete floor between the office buildings, where before you  had knee-height grass making communication between offices inefficient  (PCB traces).  AMD famously uses Infinity Fabric, which we\u2019ll discuss  later, but on a hardware level it\u2019s likely that they\u2019re using TSMC\u2019s  CoWoS \u2013 Chip on Wafer on Substrate technology. In this implementation,  the Chip is put on a Wafer that helps communication between the chips  (the concrete floor), which is put on a substrate (the ground). \\[6\\]The  second approach, which Intel is pursuing with EMIB (and TSMC are  exploring in very early stages), is basically forgoing the concrete  floor and choosing to use tunnels between the office buildings instead.  \\[7\\]While this approach is faster \u2013 each tunnel is dedicated to only  connecting two dies, so you won\u2019t have issues where data is trying to  get to lots of different places at once and getting \u2018stuck\u2019, as you  would with AMD\u2019s approach, it\u2019s harder to design products for \u2013 you have  to design and place a tunnel, rather than simply placing a concrete  foundation and plonking whatever you want on the foundation. Really,  this is a simple continuation of the two companies\u2019 philosophies. AMD\u2019s  HyperTransport, the predecessor of Infinity Fabric, is an open source  interconnect that can easily be implemented across processors.  Meanwhile, Intel\u2019s EMIB predecessor, FSB, was proprietary and needs to  be specially modified for each processor design. While Intel has made  it\u2019s successor to FSB, AIB (advanced interface bus) open-source in an  attempt to alleviate flaws, much like its 10nm process, the differences  inherent in initial design choices are difficult to overcome. Which  approach is going to be superior remains to be seen. In my opinion, it\u2019s  evident that each company has chosen the approach that\u2019s best for it \u2013  Intel with its larger budget/manpower can afford have teams of engineers  working on specialised implementations of packaging for each product,  to get slightly better performance; while AMD\u2019s smaller size drives them  to seek a scalable, easily replicable design that can be used across  many designs with minimal adaptation. Infinity Fabric, which is AMD\u2019s  own protocol implementing extremely high speed connections between  different dies (essentially, the secret sauce in how the \u2018concrete  foundation\u2019 is made), can in theory be used by any company to connect  their custom chiplets to Zen chiplets with minimal input from AMD, which  is impossible with Intel. \\[8\\] At the same time, it could also be used  by AMD in GPUs to make chiplet-based designs, which could have a massive  impact on scalability of performance, manufacturing costs etc. \u2013 just  like what happened in the CPU area. One only needs to look at the  massive Nvidia A100 chip, with its correspondingly massive manufacturing  costs, to see how much of an impact this could have on the market.\n\nChiplets  are here right now from AMD/TSMC, they\u2019re sort of here from Intel,  expected to come online at a much larger scale from Intel in the next  few years, and will be here to stay. The two \u2018teams\u2019 have differing  philosophies in how their chiplets are constructed, and it\u2019ll be  fascinating to see which is more successful. In my opinion, if Intel can  improve the morale of its engineers and kick things into high gear,  EMIB will be more successful in high-performance computing workloads,  while the simpler approach from AMD/TSMC have secured them dominance for  the next two years at the very least.\n\n3D stacking\n\nIn  theory, going 3D is just another form of chiplets (you put each chip on  top of each other, instead of next to each other), but the challenges  are sufficiently different that it\u2019s easier to discuss them separately.\n\n3D  stacking is probably a lot closer than what most people think. Despite  the fact that Intel announced its\u2019 \u2018Foveros\u2019 stacking tech in 2019 \\[9\\],  Samsung announced their \u2018X-cube\u2019 packaging a few weeks ago \\[10\\], and  TSMC announcing their \u20183DFabric\u2019 family just a few days ago \\[11\\], the  reality is that 3D stacking has been around for years. As explained  earlier, the problem with 3D stacking is that you need to dissipate the  heat, as well as transfer data. High-performance chips like those made  by Intel, AMD and Nvidia produce large amounts of heat and require large  amounts of data throughput, making it difficult for them to use 3D  stacking. However, other types of chips with lower heat and data, like  mobile phones, have been using PoP (Package on Package) stacking  forever, which basically folds a 2-chip processor in half like a book,  to reduce to horizontal footprint while increasing the vertical  footprint.\\[12\\] Even \u2018true\u2019 3D stacking \u2013 where you build layers one on  top of another, is viable in certain use cases. DRAM manufacturers have  been using 3D stacking since 2011, and NAND manufacturing wasn\u2019t far  behind.\\[13\\] SK Hynix recently released a 128-layer NAND SSD! For the  high-performance chips we are most concerned with, we have mostly solved  the issues with transferring data, and simply need to solve the cooling  issues and manufacturing challenges. The way that data is transferred  through different layers is using TSV (through-silicon vias). \\[14\\] These  are essentially elevators going through the layers that transfer data.  Compared to PoP solutions, the chip is higher density, and the  connection is shorter -elevators are direct and faster. While we can  technically stack any chips we want together right now \u2013 TSMC\u2019s SoIC is  slated for mass production in 2021 (likely for mobile chips), \\[11\\] the  issue is that cutting edge chips \u2013 especially x86 chips used in  datacentres which go for thousands of dollars, throw off a lot of heat.  AMD Epyc\u2019s 7742 has a TDP (thermal design power \u2013 an approximation of  how much heat a processor outputs under load) of 225W, \\[15\\]while Intel\u2019s  Xeon 9282 has a TDP of 400W. \\[16\\] When you consider the fact that all  this heat is coming off a piece of silicon &lt;500mm2, it\u2019s apparent  that it\u2019s extremely difficult to disperse all that energy. Current  techniques, where we essentially have a lump of metal on top of the chip  conducting heat up to a fan that shifts huge volumes of cool air past  the chip, cooling it down, are about as optimised as they can be. Before  we can stack CPU logic chips on each other, we most likely need a  paradigm shift in design philosophies \u2013 either drastic improvements in  efficiency, or more likely some way to conduct heat out of the chip  better than we have now. The most advanced suggestion so far seems to be  tiny channels between layers that circulate coolant inside the chip,  making it so each layer is cooled well rather than just the top layer as  is the case with current designs. \\[17\\] Obviously, this is completely  uneconomical to mass produce currently. However, it is possible with  current technology to place a less hot component on top of a logic die  and reap the speed benefits between those two chips \u2013 for instance  Samsung\u2019s newly announced X-cube technology, which places SRAM on top of  a logic die. \\[10\\] We\u2019re likely to see a few years of this sort of  in-between state, where RAM; IO; FPGA etc. are stacked on top of logic  dies, before we reach the \u2018Holy Grail\u2019 of high-power logic on logic \u2013  and perhaps even every component in a system, from CPU, GPU, RAM, to  various accelerators being all packaged into one single chip  horizontally, laterally and vertically. True 3D stacking is so far away  that it\u2019s impossible to see the winner, however when judging the  intermediary efforts that various vendors have announced, I am of the  opinion that Intel has the greatest potential with Foveros for the  reasons below; while Samsung is extremely competitive \u2013 even leading, in  the areas where it is offering solutions, and TSMC is the overall  leader with the widest array of offerings which are all highly  effective, both in cost and performance.\n\nAfter  reading all that, you probably feel cheated. Wasn\u2019t I going to tell you  why Intel\u2019s future is promising? It feels like I just explained the  opposite doesn\u2019t it? Well, the reasoning for why I said Intel\u2019s future  is promising is threefold.\n\n1. Packaging  is in its\u2019 infancy compared to process. Intel might appear to be behind  now, but the distance is definitely not as much as they are behind in  process, and given where we are in packaging maturity (we\u2019re at the very  start of the diminishing returns graph, where it\u2019s easy to make big  strides), Intel could easily climb ahead given their engineering  prowess. In addition, opposite of what has become evident in  lithography, where outsourcing to a specialised foundry has \u2018won\u2019 the  battle against vertical integration, it could very well be that  integration will be more successful in packaging, with a holistic,  unified approach to designing a chip proving useful.\n2. Intel  spends far more money on research than anyone else - $13 billion in  2019, while TSMC spent $3 billion. (or 18.6% of revenue vs 8.5%).  \\[18\\]\\[19\\] Although Intel\u2019s operations are broader, with investments in  anything from process/packaging to self-driving and memory, it\u2019s likely  that Intel\u2019s spending on packaging and process exceeds that of  competitors. In addition, Intel\u2019s engineers are colloquially known to be  some of the best in the business. It\u2019s current woes are largely a  function of management problems, not monetary or talent-based.\n3. Intel\u2019s  (mis)management deserves a post, if not a book of its own. Suffice it  to say the corporate equivalent of Game of Thrones has been going down  for the past decade, and now Littlefinger has finally managed to slay  his enemies and gain complete control. Littlefinger may not be the best  person to lead an semiconductor company, and his position may be  constantly under threat from the Iron Bank (the board), but at least the  internal politics and strife should be largely out of the way, opening  up the chance for a focused Intel putting their full momentum behind a  comeback \u2013 a terrifying thought for any competitors.\n\nIf these possibilities do come to pass, the future of AMD, and to a lesser extent TSMC/Nvidia looks bleak.\n\nSemiconductors  are an incredibly complex industry. The very things that create such  huge barriers to entry for competitors, and impressive returns for  shareholders, make it difficult for us to truly understand the  technological aspect of the companies are we invested in. My investing  style relies heavily on an understanding of the things I\u2019m investing in,  and I hope that this series looking at some of the more technical  aspects of semiconductors can help all of you gain an understanding as  well, and to cut through the marketing spiel that management regularly  throws at us.\n\nFeel free to contact me if there\u2019s anything you\u2019d like me to look at, and thanks for taking the time to read!\n\n\\[1\\] [https://cartesianproduct.wordpress.com/2013/04/15/the-end-of-dennard-scaling/](https://cartesianproduct.wordpress.com/2013/04/15/the-end-of-dennard-scaling/)\n\n\\[2\\] [https://www.eetimes.com/euv-tool-costs-hit-120-million/](https://www.eetimes.com/euv-tool-costs-hit-120-million/)\n\n\\[3\\] [http://euvlsymposium.lbl.gov/pdf/2012/pres/G.%20Yeric.pdf](http://euvlsymposium.lbl.gov/pdf/2012/pres/G.%20Yeric.pdf)\n\n\\[4\\] [https://semiengineering.com/knowledge\\_centers/packaging/advanced-packaging/](https://semiengineering.com/knowledge_centers/packaging/advanced-packaging/)\n\n\\[5\\] [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340843129\\_Chiplet\\_Heterogeneous\\_Integration\\_Technology-Status\\_and\\_Challenges](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340843129_Chiplet_Heterogeneous_Integration_Technology-Status_and_Challenges)\n\n\\[6\\] [https://www.tsmc.com/english/dedicatedFoundry/services/cowos.htm](https://www.tsmc.com/english/dedicatedFoundry/services/cowos.htm)\n\n\\[7\\] [https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/foundry/emib.html](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/foundry/emib.html)\n\n\\[8\\] [https://www.amd.com/en/campaigns/hpc-solutions-webinar](https://www.amd.com/en/campaigns/hpc-solutions-webinar)\n\n\\[9\\] [https://www.eejournal.com/article/intel-foveros-3d-packaging/](https://www.eejournal.com/article/intel-foveros-3d-packaging/)\n\n\\[10\\] [https://news.samsung.com/global/tag/samsung-x-cube](https://news.samsung.com/global/tag/samsung-x-cube)\n\n\\[11\\]TSMC Technology Symposium 2020\n\n\\[12\\] [https://sst.semiconductor-digest.com/chipworks\\_real\\_chips\\_blog/2019/01/16/the-packaging-of-apples-a12x-is-weird/](https://sst.semiconductor-digest.com/chipworks_real_chips_blog/2019/01/16/the-packaging-of-apples-a12x-is-weird/)\n\n\\[13\\] [https://www.nvmdurance.com/history-of-3d-nand-flash-memory/](https://www.nvmdurance.com/history-of-3d-nand-flash-memory/)\n\n\\[14\\] [http://www.appliedmaterials.com/files/Applied\\_TSV\\_Primer.pdf](http://www.appliedmaterials.com/files/Applied_TSV_Primer.pdf)\n\n\\[15\\] [https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-epyc-7742](https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-epyc-7742)\n\n\\[16\\] [https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/194146/intel-xeon-platinum-9282-processor-77m-cache-2-60-ghz.html](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/194146/intel-xeon-platinum-9282-processor-77m-cache-2-60-ghz.html)\n\n\\[17\\] [https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02503-1](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02503-1)\n\n\\[18\\] [https://www.intc.com/filings-reports/all-sec-filings/content/0000050863-20-000011/0000050863-20-000011.pdf](https://www.intc.com/filings-reports/all-sec-filings/content/0000050863-20-000011/0000050863-20-000011.pdf)\n\n\\[19\\] [https://www.tsmc.com/download/ir/annualReports/2019/english/index.html](https://www.tsmc.com/download/ir/annualReports/2019/english/index.html)\n\n\\[20\\] [https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-leadership-tech-team-changes-not-delayed-murthy-renduchintala-leaves](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-leadership-tech-team-changes-not-delayed-murthy-renduchintala-leaves)",

        "selftext": "Like many of you, I lost money, but I also made money\n\nBefore I get into that, let me tell you a story about the last two weeks:\n\nlast week - bunch of retards making the market go parabolic with fomo over aapl and tsla splits\n\nlast week - as spy increased, we saw vix go UP, which generally happens when the market is pricing in a blown off top\n\nmonday of this week - tsla and aapl finally getting corrected, a sigh of relief, but wait, vix is still going up, hmm, thats not good\n\nwednesday of this week - very large correction on tsla and aapl, but a minor retrace to end the day. If you were paying attention, you shouldve sold all your shit on this day.\n\nWhy, you may ask? Because of today's timeline\n\n8:00 AM EST - the zoomer coin crashes, whales are pulling out\n\n9:30 AM EST - the FUD from tsla crashing caused all the fomo holders of ARK etfs to sell\n\n9:45 AM EST - bc everyone started selling ARK etfs trying to escape their tsla positions due to already seeing red the previous day, other ARK holdings like square and amazon started crashing as well (which are qqq holdings too).\n\n10:00 AM EST - because everyone started selling qqq holdings, the QQQ holders started selling because they already felt pain from aapl. The central time zone also woke up and started selling QQQ\n\n11:00 AM EST - because QQQ started crashing, SPY holders started getting nervous and selling off. PLUS, california woke up and started selling\n\nNOON EST - it was at this time that the FUD news articles started getting written and the smooth brains started selling off\n\nthe rest of the day proceeded as you would expect\n\non a side note, fuck you cunts who sent tsla and aapl parabolic, youre the reason my ark position is bleeding out of its ass today\n\nanyway, here's whats going to happen. As more and more of the world wakes up to the fact that tech is gonna go down much further, we'll have one more crash day, and most likely two small red days following that\n\nWhat should you do, you might ask?\n\nFirst, lets identify where support is currently. One can do this by looking at stocks like nvda, amzn, googl, fb, crm, tsla, aapl, and identifying where the tech support levels are. Generally this is the point where they were before aapl and tsla fomoers sent them parabolic. Once tech reaches those support levels, the selloff on the broad market will stop, just like the selloff began from the tech market\n\ndo you need to know this support? Not really, because\n\nVXX 35 november calls will still print. You want november expiration so that you wont get iv crushed, since youll get padded with the election FUD.\n\nEven though youre late, you can still make 10-20% gains as the second day of crashing occurs. However, you want to identify the support levels you will close your positions at\n\nand thats it folks, buy volatility, since it will go up.\n\nAlternatively, you could do puts on qqq, but im pretty smooth brained so ive rarely made money on puts, so i just stay away from them",

        "selftext": "NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) shares have soared in 2020, more than doubling versus an S&amp;P 500 rising by less than 3%. The stock got an extra boost this past week after it announced it would acquire Arm Holdings from SoftBank Group for $40 billion. Despite the significant acquisition, some traders are betting the stock has seen its peak and is heading lower. Meanwhile, an analysis of the technical chart suggests the equity drops 12% from its price of $487 on September 18.\n\nNVIDIA paid what amounts to nearly 21 times sales for Arm Holdings, based on the fiscal year 2020 results. However, that is about the same premium that SoftBank paid for Arm back in 2016, when SoftBank bought the company for $31 billion. One could argue that NVIDIA may have even overpaid for Arm, given that revenue growth has decelerated since 2015.  \n\nBetting The Shares Will Fall\n\nThe deal to acquire Arm from Softbank will be dilutive to existing shareholders. NVIDIA will pay $21.5 billion in its stock to SoftBank, allowing SoftBank to take a stake in NVIDIA of between 6.7% and 8.1%. That dilution could be why an options trader is betting that NVIDIA stock falls from its current levels.\n\nOn September 18, the open interest levels for the NVIDIA November 20 $500 puts and calls rose. The data shows that 4,000 of the $500 calls were sold for about $49.40, and 4,000 of the $500 puts were bought for approximately $52.90. It creates a bearish spread transaction where the trader paid about $3.50 for the contracts and is a bet the stock is below $496.50 by the expiration date.\n\nTechnicals Nearing A Breaking Point\n\nAdditionally, the technical chart suggests that NVIDIA shares may fall as well. The stock has already fallen about 18% from its peak, and those declines may grow worse. The shares are now sitting on an uptrend that formed in early March. Should the stock fall below that trendline and break support at $460, it could result in the shares falling to around $427, a drop of an additional 12%.\n\nExpensive Deal\n\nThe deal for Arm Holdings is likely to prove to be an expensive one for NVIDIA, with the company paying about $21 billion in stock to close the acquisition, while likely financing the balance through cash and debt. The company had about $11 billion in cash and short-term investments at the end of the July quarter.\n\nNVIDIA paid about 20.6 times those 2020 sales for Arm, about the same as the 20 times sales Softbank paid in 2016. But consider that Arm had revenue growth of just 1.5% in 2019 and 7.5% in 2020. Arm had revenue growth of 15% in 2015 in US dollar terms, and 22% in British pounds. When adjusting for growth, one could argue that NVIDIA could have gotten Arm for a lower price to sales multiple when considering the slower growth rate.  \n\nGrowth Through Acquisition\n\nThe latest move, which follows last year\u2019s purchase of Mellanox, could even be seen as a sign by some investors that NVIDIA now needs to move to a model of growth by addition, helping to maintain those big sales and earnings growth rates. The company needs to keep these tremendous growth rates to support the massive earnings multiple the market affords it, currently at 44.1 times next year\u2019s earnings estimates.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how investors digest NVIDIA\u2019s significant acquisition. Given the stock\u2019s enormous move higher, it would not be surprising at all to see the shares fall to lower prices over the short- to medium-term.\n\nMichael Kramer is a financial market strategist and the portfolio manager of the Mott Capital Thematic Growth Portfolio.\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/kramermichael/2020/09/20/nvidias-stocks-may-plunge-12-followings-it-deal-for-arm/amp/",

        "selftext": "Listen idiots, when the market goes full retard and becomes this volatile, you don't have to become a retard with it. Instead of throwing thousands on hourlies or on retarded OTM FDs expiring this friday, buy 1-2 long term calls or LEAPS. No, your fucking 10/16 or 9/20 calls aint LEAPS. LEAPs are options contracts with expiration dates that are longer than one year. Don't go all in at once. Shit is expensive but much much safer. LEAPS have a juicy delta and theta will be on your side. I know, this is unheard of on this sub but it's a thing. I'd recommend buying a LEAP as close to ATM as possible. Why? So you can sell weekly OTM calls on green days and profit off your fellow retards. You are basically converting your LEAP into a vertical spread and your long leg will act as collateral if shit goes wrong. If this is too technical for you, and are too retarded to google Options 101, just buy OTM 2022 LEAPs. There's a lot of shit on discount right now; $PYPL, $MSFT, $NVDA, $BA, etc. Since we are living on retarded times, be ready to average down when the market is period-red.

        "selftext": "I went to financial training seminar while in the military in November 1999 and the lady talked about how stocks like the second coming of christ as the only true path to increase your wealth. I sold all my silver age comics and things and sunk all my savings about 8000 dollars not much into the top growth stocks at the time. Nokia, JDSU, Qualcom (had a 5,000 percent spike that year), and GLW.    \n\n   Cell phones and fiber optics were where it was at in the late month of December Nokia was a 250 dollar a share darling at the time.  Well, one month later my portfolio was worth 1,500 dollars. I had one tech mutual fund i had sunk my whole paycheck of 1,500 dollars that was worth 200 dollars the next month. I held onto it for a while after the crash but by july I put 400 dollars each in XOm and LMT (20 dollars a share)  and rest in a Marvel trading around in the low 1 dollar range after the release of the first x-men movie. Now it was all about biotech companies and Yahoo post crash but i went for marvel. The stock was cheaper than the price of a comic book and  I thought, I was a genius when I sold marvel for 23 dollars a share a few years later such a bad decision. I used the money for my master's degree and housing.\n\nI invested a little in the 2000's, After 9/11 amazon was in the 25 dollar range and I picked up a few hundred dollars worth of it and google when it ipo'd at a 100 dollars a share. Google at the time was saying they were over priced at a hundred dollars a share. The hot stock at the time was Taser now AXXN. So, i've had a few years of success and decided sell my stocks to buy a car and put money toward my condo. I took all my saving and went all in october 2007. My dad convinced me to invest in Fannie Mae she looked so safe and respectable. I bought it at 61 dollars a share and it just started to decline right away but i held only to have my diamond hands cut off a few months later when the stock markets crashed in 2008 and I sold it at 60 cents a share. I was utterly destroyed and swore off stocks and cashed out till the recent market crash in march.  The only thing i had left were the stock certificates from Xom and LMT.\n\nI had developed what this one nurse i work with calls \"I want to see my money in front of me.\" I've had my money just sitting doing nothing in a money market for a decade.  i was just afraid to invest and i'd see facebook Ipo, apple's smartphone or the rise of netflix and think they'd be really good investments but was mortally afraid of repeating what happened twice before. But after the March crash I decided to jump back in and i've done really well these past few months with my early investments in NVDA, Adobe, apple, msft, apple and amazon. i've grown my portfolio from 5,000 dollars to 56k even after apple took a huge dive the past few days. Looking at the valuations of some of these stocks i did get the pangs of fear i felt in 99 and ended up selling nvda, adobe, amazon, msft and put it all on apple with 17k on the side for the future snowflake and air b&amp;b ipo. I did pick up more apple in the morning when it hit 113.  I feel staying the course even after a huge loss is the best long term strategy and avoid fannie mae she's a dirty dirty girl.

ZM has a PE ratio of 622,   \n meaning if they have weak growth from here, you could be stuck holding a bag for decades to get a 100% return from this price level. SNOW is burning investor money (negative PE ratio) and is back at its scandalously overvalued IPO price of $250 (buffet bought at $75). ZM is currently trading at 8x value from the start of the year and 2020 Y/Y revenue has increased only 1.9x. $500 is a nice round number, maybe I should buy some ZM puts?\n\nLow and behold, CEO yuan eric sold a whopping $69 million of ZM stock on 9/23 and 9/24 (reported on 9/25 after hours) and currently holds zero shares:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2349b12lpyp51.png?width=1055&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3ca189675372dd20b202e0df05c148bb9bf8e99\n\nLike holy crap, if I owned ZM I'd sell it all too at this price level. Who wants to work hard to grow a company when you can cash in and retire on a cool $69 million? MRNA had a similar situation and sold off 35% from 7/17 to 9/2. Huge bear signal. I bet ZM fully fills the gap to $325 within two months.\n\nWhy is 100x revenue a lot? NVDA is trading at 22x revenue and AAPL at 7x revenue, and both of these companies are blue chips that are more profitable and have, in my opinion, much better long term growth potential (AI revolution gonna be huge, AAPL and NVDA to the moon). \n\nAlso ZM isn't the only company that provides peer to peer voice call service. Did you know that MSFT owns skype? AAPL owns facetime, AMZN owns twitch, and many other companies compete with zoom.\n\nLastly, Trump announced live today near close that rapid corona virus test kits are rolling out soon, with results available in minutes, and the vaccine is on verge of phase 3 approval.

        "selftext": "Are you sad about missing out on the NVDA, AMD, and AAPL runups? The good news is that the company that provides essential semiconductor capabilities to these companies is TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.) TSM contractually manufactures chipsets for 499 clients. By focusing solely on contracted production, TSM has the smallest (5nm) chip on the market and a 3nm chip on the horizon, creating an infrastructural economic moat insurmountable even for the aforementioned veteran firms, who struggle to produce 7nm chips by comparison. Recently blowing Intel out of the water, TSMC is years ahead of its competitors.\n\nTSMC is trading at a 26.67 P/E ratio, compared to NVDA's 91 P/E and AMD's 152 P/E ratio. One reason for this cheap valuation is that people think Taiwan may be invaded by mainland China. As a student of international relations specifically studying Cross-Strait relations, I can tell you this is a fallacy. Taiwan-United States relations have never been better, and the United States even has a bill that almost explicitly says The United States will protect Taiwan in the event of an attack. [https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/why-us-lawmakers-introduce-bill-after-bill-help-taiwan](https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/why-us-lawmakers-introduce-bill-after-bill-help-taiwan)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e5ez47gq9jm51.png?width=740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c6e97224e63f2b8eec427fb924111f7f5adaacc\n\nAnother reason why people may be scared of TSMC's future is because of mainland China's desire to get into the semiconductor industry. Recently, however, rumors that TSMC employees have been poached to mainland China's were proven false. The company is dead in the water, leaving TSMC as the sole fab. [https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4004304](https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4004304) TMSC is also expanding production capacity by planning a massive $12bn manufacturing facility in Arizona, showing clear growth potential. \n\nAfter great news in late July, the stock has shot up about 20%. Since then, it has successfully tested a base of $77 time and time again. The 10-week line (in red) is rapidly approaching this base, and the company is ready to shoot off. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t7due2ot8jm51.png?width=1270&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c3ae01dde9f878ac05e5f0b89cae19d47677e52\n\nThink about it: with Neuralink, self-driving cars, faster cell phones, drones, electronic body implants and accessories, and more automation, what product will be in the highest demand?

        "selftext": " **NVIDIA 3rd Party Card Catastrophe**  \n\n\nListen up idiots, \n\nSo most GPUs are made by a 3rd party. AMD and NVIDIA make the actual \"brain\" of the GPU but 3rd party partners add onto it for better performance (very basic explanation). Don't ask me why this is, it is just mainly because of logistical reasons.  \n\nBut that is not the point, the point is that the great majority of GPUs are third-party cards meaning that they get to change around the design of the PCB. The issue here is that some of these third-party partners cheaped out on little capacitors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Big Capacitors](https://preview.redd.it/63d87b2bwip51.png?width=980&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a95dc6f5ecad00af735592a86b9d9f64a919c504)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Big + Small \\(more expensive but better\\)](https://preview.redd.it/jnv10ezcwip51.png?width=980&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f67fb502c4876ff55bc3ea7b1abe92b957c1d74)\n\n By cheaping out it is leading to bad power delivery. The only way to fix this rn is to down clock the card which the normal person doesn't know how to do and doesn't expect is necessary when they are buying a 500$+ piece of hardware.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like if there is a mass callback that will be bad PR. NVIDIA could always release drivers that make the cards run below their listed spec but i'm not sure if people will really want that even if the performance loss is marginal.    \n\n\nEVGA already confirmed the suspicions that these cards were crashing because of capacitor issues. It may be different for other companies but at least for EVGA this is what they are saying currently.  \n\n\nPositions:  \nNone currently because I don't think the suits could give two shits.   \n\n\nSources:\n\n [https://www.igorslab.de/en/what-real-what-can-be-investigative-within-the-crashes-and-instabilities-of-the-force-rtx-3080-andrtx-3090/](https://www.igorslab.de/en/what-real-what-can-be-investigative-within-the-crashes-and-instabilities-of-the-force-rtx-3080-andrtx-3090/)\n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6bUUEEe-X8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6bUUEEe-X8)\n\n [https://www.tomshardware.com/news/evga-nvidia-rtx-3080-capacitor-caused-crashes](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/evga-nvidia-rtx-3080-capacitor-caused-crashes)   \n\n\n*This is not financial advice just me presenting the facts and the possibility of a callback.*",

        "selftext": "I took my car in to a local service center for some regular maintenance. While waiting in line, I overhear the 3 service technicians talking about stocks. All Caucasians for those interested. But nevertheless, piqued, my interest was, of course. I leaned over and started dropping some mad eaves. Fellow 1, let's called him Ball D., was asking Fellow 2, Beardfac\u00e8, if he should buy more shares of Tesla and Apple. Before Beardfac\u00e8 could reply, Fellow 3, Slagathor, chimes in with a \"Hell yea! Now's the time to buy!\" Beardfac\u00e8 starts talking about how stocks are only going to go up and how he's made so much money that he bought his girlfriend, now fiance, a new shiny rock. And this goes on for some time of Beardfac\u00e8 and Slagathor convincing Ball D. to add more money with absolutely 0 sentences inserted about fundamentals. To convince him they both opened up their Robinhood accounts and bought more shares. Ball D. fomo's and buys some too right there and then. They then get very excited and Slagathor seals the deal with the following statement \"scared money don't make money.\" \n\ntl;dr - when idiots start spouting \"scared money don't make money\" to other idiots without understanding anything.\n\nNow the actual dip that we all fear is probably some time away or tomorrow, who knows. But I've learned now that when you start hearing this sort of talk in public from Joe Shmoe, it's about to get ugly. When scared money enters irrationally, scared money exits irrationally. People will sell with the same exuberance that they bought with. \n\nComing back to me... I sold all my positions in Apple, Tesla, NVidia, Microsoft, Google, and Boeing. Since the beginning of the year, I've made 200k, with NVDA gaining me 100k of that with a 210% profit. Boeing, made me lose $5000. Which in retrospect, is not at all bad. But I bought it at $170 and sold at $157 (today). Airlines are not going to be recovering anytime soon and buying back in when there are actual orders of planes/profit from BA is plenty opportunity for future gains. \n\nThe current, metaphorical, well is too deep and you don't know if there's snakes at the bottom. With COVID, back to school/work cases unknown, commercial real estate not making money and people about to get evicted, banks making loans to Joe Shmoe's wife's boyfriend so he can buy a house for you because the Fed printer go brrr, the election, no working vaccines, and a bunch of other macro geopolitical issues, for anyone that actually watches global news -  I'm out. Now, with my earnings, not my savings, I'll buy options for things I know will happen. Like what you say? What happens when Apple reveals a new product? Go ahead and correlate product releases and stock price movement. \n\ntl;dr - I sold everything, made money, and I'll play options now like a good WSBer. \n\ntl;dr - I don't risk much and invest very conservatively. As much as I love seeing a 210% gain, that shit don't make any sense and I'm out with some profit until valuations meet MY expectations.",

DLSS is witch craft, able to easily double the FPS in games. it simply makes no more sense to buy amd gpu any more. plus nvidia has better drivers, as always.\n\nand dont forget the Samsung deal. nvidia's able to reduce price on 3000 series cards due to samsung offering very cheap price, rumor is half of what TSMC offers. this means much higher margins when it reports next earnings. the EPS gonna go through the roof.\n\ncloud gaming is booming. its a new industry that analysts expect to grow to 5 billion industry in just a few years. nvidia is including a 1 year free GFN subscription with 3000 series purchase by the way, in order to further kickstart the cloud gaming business. cloud gaming is bascially video game streaming, like netflix. so if netlifx get crazy valuation even though its only a pure play in streaming, why cant nvidia?\n\ndata center business is growing strong. it surpassed gaming revenue for the first time. the AI business will continue to be a secular trend. we're living increasingly in a digital world. think of all the surveilllence system, what do you think power them to do facial recognization? its the GPUs. china's been expanding its police state and will only require even more GPUs to do the tasks and the rest of the world will follow too.\n\nonce nvidia finish the ARM aquision, it will have CPU capabilities just like intel and amd. and ARM cpus has been growing stronger every year. nvidia, being a new player in the CPU space, gonna compete against intel data center business by releasing cheaper cpus. if AMD stock price is skyrocketing coz people think they gonna take intel's cake, imagine what gonna happen with nvidia when people realize nvidia poses an even stronger threat to intel than amd does?\n\nalso, nvidia has superb software. its CUDA ecosystem is industry standard. its very hard to break away from an ecosystem. CUDA is to AI what microsoft office is to office work. amd and intel are not gonna be able to take its place.\n\nnvidia market cap now is only 300 billion. 1 trillion is totally achievable within 1 year, honestly i wouldnt even be surprised if it achieves 700 billion before the end of 2020, especially with the QE environment we are in right now. it will be the first semiconductor company with 1 trillion valuation and it well deserves it.",

        "selftext": "I tried to beat the market and made just 2.8% in unrealized gains until now in the year 2020. Here's how that happened.\n\nI invested a total of $65000 in stocks this year. I transferred money into my brokerage account in 16 installments, each time depositing anywhere from 1k to 10k. Instead of readily putting the deposited money into some kind of ETF like QQQ or SPY, I bought individual stocks like MSFT, AAPL, TEAM, BA, C, etc., without any homework at random times. Sometimes, I held cash waiting for the right time to buy something. During the covid-19 crash in march, I caught falling knife on couple of stocks like BA, C, BAC, etc. Due to those losses, I stopped investing for a couple of months exactly when the prices were at minimum of the year.\n\nAll of this lead to a significantly low % of returns on my investments. Recently, I calculated how much money I could have made if I immediately invested the deposited money on the same day into QQQ, ARKW, XSD, SPY, etc. and that revealed the bitter truth. QQQ would have given me 18%, ARKW 58%, XSD 14.8% and SPY 4.7%. I know what I did isn't smart. I want to know how can I feel less sad about this. \n\nEven after this realization, I tried to create my own ETF sort of thing with some proportions across individual stocks. For ex: AAPL 20%, MSFT 15%, AMZN 15%, NVDA 10%, a bunch of growth stocks at 1.5%, etc. When I backtested my ETF purchase across my deposit intervals, I found that I could have made 37.9% in returns. This higher percentage is stopping me from switching to QQQ. Although ARKW returned 58%, I don't want to put all my money in it because they rebalance their holdings every quarter and they hold TSLA and few other risky stocks at large proportions. Even though TSLA is doing very good now, I am concerned about using ARKW and not having stop-loss on TSLA holdings. If I can control my holdings, I can setup stop-loss and protect myself when risky stocks go down. The problem with my ETF is that it's difficult to maintain determined proportions and stop-loss orders. When I want to invest smaller amounts of money, I have to rely on fractional shares and my brokerage doesn't provide that, so I have to shift to Robinhood or other trading platform. What do you think about this?",

        "selftext": "BMO, a Canadian bank that I bank with, also has options available for trading.\n\nIt was trading at around $100 CAD and then sank to $58 during the Covid-19 bust. It's been around for 202 years and invented the dividend in Canada, 191 years of on-time consecutive dividend payments, and nearly all of its mortgages are on the books of the federal government so it's going back to $105 I expect. It hasn't lowered its dividend since World War II ended although I think the federal government forced it to cut (but not eliminate)  its dividend during WWII. Point being:\n\nSo I bought the $80 calls expiring in January 2022.  They cost me about $760 a piece. At $105, they're worth $2,500. Figures in CAD.\n\nBut here's where it gets interesting, although I missed it:\n\nHad I bought 10 of the $60s expring in Jan. 22, a few months back, I could have sold them at a double when the stock hit about $71. Then I could have picked up the $73's -- twenty of them, and sold them at a double when the stock hit $85 (which it did). Then I could have picked forty of the $85s, and sold them at a double when the stock hits about $102, which it will I expect, before Jan. 22.\n\nThat's three doubles, but also, 2 more doubles because I'm picking up twice as many options, two times.\n\nThat's 2\\^5 = 32 times, or turning $6,000 or so into $192,000  on about a 75% move on the stock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was an article in the Globe and Mail paper about a retail trader out on the West coast in Richmond, B.C. who claimed to make 1000 times his money in the 2011 gold bust. (It's $1600 ---&gt; $1.7 million, not $17 million as the link suggests; it's correct in the story).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/how-a-trader-turned-1600-into-17-million-in-six-months/article21592425/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/how-a-trader-turned-1600-into-17-million-in-six-months/article21592425/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt seemed like bullshit, except for the fact the the G+M is the NYT of Canada, so every now again I would read the article and try and understand how that was possible with futures or margin, but I couldn't work out how it could be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGold made two big moves downward in 2011, Sept-Oct. and then a longer move in Nov.-Jan 2012.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI now believe he did it with short term (2 month or so) low theta, medium gamma, mid-delta (ATM) put options. That would require something like 6, 100% moves on the ATM option and 4 contract double-ups, or 2\\^(5+4) = 2\\^10 = 1024. I'd have to check to see whether GLD or the actual GC futures options could support that but I think it's possible with fairly short-dated options, like 2 months, given the 2011 gold collapse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou probably could have done this with calls on the rally in Apple, NVDA and the various U.S. tech stocks, Shopify here at home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyone have any experience with this? I'm talking:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* long only, not short options. Pure long play.\n* reinvest all proceeds by doubling up.\n* Do this a few times, make 20x, 30x your money\n\nI'm trying to do this with Suncor. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI bought the $13's (US version) expiring Jan. 2022. I figure it should hit $30 or so on the recovery by or before then.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I paid $3.30, so at $19 I'll double my money. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen I sell that, buy a pair of $20's, and get about a triple at $30. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo that's 2\\*2\\*3 = 12 times my money on a 2.2 times move in the stock. That's crazy and impossible to do with margin, but possible with long options. ",

The Options Chain only allows people to buy calls now. Wall Street now only consists of a three tickers: AAPL, TSLA, and NVDA. Their ever-changing prices flash over the RobinHood\u2122\ufe0f sponsored billboard in the square-- all up 20% premarket.\n\n\"Well, stocks only goes up,\" says Kyle, a renowned broker and serial Monster Energy consumer.\n\nThe hottest restaurant on Wall St. serves chicken tenders. In fact, all restaurants on Wall St. only sell \"Tendie meals\" for the special hungry broker boys, prepared just how their mothers did when they were young.\n\nKyle leers at the restaurant for a moment, but walks into the building where his firm is located.\n\nTravis Scott plays in the bullpen of the firm, a sea of zoomers juuling while staring at their phones under pulsating LED light strips lining the ceiling. \n\n\"Haha TSLA is MOOONING\" blurts one young broker, \"NVDA \ud83d\ude80\" says another.\n\n\"How the fuck did you just say \ud83d\ude80?\" Inquires a green intern. Everyone laughs. \n\nSuddenly, the LEDs stop pulsating and switch to white. All the zoomers look up from their robinhood apps. The Travis Scott blaring from the loudspeaker fades to nothing. John Apple, the new CEO of Apple is making an announcement via everyone's Neuralink\u2122\ufe0f chips. \n\n\"Greetings. Today we are announcing a new phone case made entirely from recycled juulpods. I would also like to announce to you all, the iPod nano air special edition, featuring new songs, all by Travis Scott...\" he droned on and on about special features and the business implications of these new products, but nobody listened.\n\nThese are all good things, but it was not the news the zoomers wanted to hear. The zoomers were hopeful that Apple would be buying Juul. They all pick up their phones and open the Robinhood App. In one swift motion, they all click \"sell,\" but nothing happens. The shares and contracts are still in their portfolio, what is happening?\n\n\"Oh, that's right haha, stocks only go up!\" reminds one zoomer. They all collectively remembered the removal of the \"sell\" feature from robinhood back in 2028, followed by the removal from the market as a whole in 2029, ensuring that stocks only go up. They all decide to buy more.\n\nApple ended the day +30%, Tesla +60%, and Nvidia +28%. It was a tough day for Nvidia. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo be continued...",

It's also currently the #1 in cloud services field which is a future for computation and machine intelligence.\n\nI realize most of AMZN buyers are there for a long ride. However, I was holding it since 3200$ in July thinking of only about 0.5-1 year perspective, cause I'm leaving my current job (going to Ph.D.) and might need some extra cash in the near future.\n\nDo you think it would be more reasonable and safe to sell it now (possibly buying it again later) or you rather think it's better not cut the loss for now since it has every chance (say, in one year) to be back again? What do you think: is this stock currently overvalued or undervalued? Forecasts from top analytics (like JPM, WFC) are still very promising.\n\nAlso, it is not really obvious for me, how creation of vaccine will affect on tech sector market and Amazon and NVDA/Netflix, in particular.

        "selftext": "\nExcuse my basic English.  \n\nHello, I\u2019m currently finishing 5th year of University in Accounting.  I\u2019m from Puerto Rico and for some reason I received a lot of money from the relief funds (much more than expected) which I moved to my savings account.  \n\nI\u2019ve been investing since 2017 (recklessly).  I\u2019ve lost 6.5k doing yolo calls with SPY.  I have 270 left on that Robinhood Portfolio... which I\u2019m probably going to swing trade with the remaining because it\u2019s a lost case for me.  \n\nNow, with these 27k in my savings, I was planning on starting a 10 year investment strategy.  It would consist on starting with 3k on Webull investing on Tesla, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Nvidia (if I keep adding without touching the remaining 24k)\n\nSince it\u2019s a 10 year plan, I would do it on Webull (taxable brokerage account), but many people have been telling to to do it in a Roth IRA.  I\u2019m not really interested in this idea because I want to cash out in 2030.  I was planning on starting a Roth IRA after I pass the CPA exam (if I do) next year.  \n\nShould I just forget about the simple 10 year investment plan and go straight to IRA or should I stay with my initial plan? I\u2019m very undecided.  \n\n\nOne other thing... I\u2019m trying to reach 40k in savings because I want to move out and I would like to buy an apartment.  This will take me like 2 or 3 years since I live with my parents and I no longer go out that much.  \nApartments here are usually in the 100k range and I might be able to pull out a 20-30% down payment.  \n\nDon\u2019t know if I should invest in those companies and keep working or just keep the money and save it all until I reach 40k.",

Battery Day is 9/22, expectation is to see a rise.  I realize the past couple of days where were all made massive gains on TSLA could have been that that battery day run-up, but it felt very early, i figured Friday morning or pre-market we'd see the buy in on it again.\n\nSo I picked up 7 stonks naturally near the fucking top before the damn thing tanked.  I know TSLA follows SPY fairly closely and I vowed off fucking with TSLA just like every other stock that has screwed me hard (NVDA looking your way).  Can we see a bump back into the green by battery day or is it that shit baked into a crisp already?  Since it's stocks I'm holding, but man I'm not a large trader but I lost the ability to buy a good car and move all gone in a few weeks.  I just can't get anything right here and ready to divert to cash once my stupid SPY calls for tomorrow expires worthless.  I'm going back to square one, it's been a while since college where I minored in Econ and took semesters of Banking and Finance (essentially stocks, bonds, option, etc.).  I should be doing better than this and it's really discouraging.  All my TA has killed (I like the Bolinger Bands and the ichimoku cloud as my main indicators) me too.  I don't consider myself a total RH noob idiot but it's turning out to be that way. \n\nAny insight, I know there a lot more TSLA heads here and I don't play the stock much given I don't like Elon, he creates uncertainty, and don't honestly see TSLA as a successful long play much longer as every other car manufacturer is getting into the business.  You're essentially buy a name and 35k isn't a luxury car; Nissan and Chevy have them beat in marketshare even. I don't know about NIO or touch it but it seems to China's equivalent.\n\nAnyway I know it's WSB but this place used to have some good replies from quality posters and I expect a lot of experienced TSLA traders to offer any insight other than \"you done fucked man\".",

In a capitalistic economy competition is very favorable and AMD is bound to see a pity run-up and I can see it hitting $140 by Febuary of 2021. Mark my words. What do you all think?",

        "selftext": "South Korean investor here (trying my best to communicate in English).\n\nI injected 30% of my total asset into US stock market (AAPL 75% and NVDA 25%) at the hike in early September, at once.\n\nHonestly, I did not spend time analysing the market. I vaguely pictured AAPL stock going up trend in anticipation of Apple event and iPhone 12. Same for NVDA, 30series would put spur on, I believed. \n\nNow my stocks are down 13%.\n\nIt seems that, after new good hours of researching, the US tech stocks are likely to go down to the point where it was pre-Covid19; which is still a long way down. \n\nMany investors in Korea tell me that the stocks are to go up-trend in the long run, so that I should stick to it.\n\nMy concern is: what if the stocks actually drop to pre-Covid19 price range and take 10-20years to make break-even? Just like MSFT in 2018 collapse. It worries me. \n\nI do not have intention to leave the market for good, I just want to find a solution; a reasonable way to react to the current market.\nRight now, I believe it is clear that \"sit and wait\" tactic does not work, it breaks my mentality. \n\nAny advice to novice? \nShould I accept the 13% loss and keep the cash and look for opportunities to buy in small portions at a time? \n\nTommy",
