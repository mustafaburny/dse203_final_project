        "selftext": "The LCID merger has been completed and the ticker change will be happening Monday 7/26. So lets start up with the background on the company.\n\nLeadership: Peter Rawlinson: Current CEO/CTO - Peter has over 30 years of automotive experience. Prior to Lucid, Peter was Vice President of Vehicle Engineering at Tesla and Chief Engineer of the Model S, where he led the engineering of the Model S.\n\nDerek Jenkins: Senior Vice President of Design and Brand - Before joining Lucid, Derek was the Director of Design at Mazda North America Operations where he oversaw all design developments locally and globally. He also spent nine years as the Chief Designer for Volkswagen North America, and eight years with Audi, serving first as Lead Exterior Designer, followed by Assistant Chief Designer for Audi Design.\n\nMichael Bell: Most recently, Michael was Chief Technology Officer for Rivian. He has 30 years in the tech field includes 16 at Apple and five at Intel. At Apple, he played significant roles in the development of iPhone, iMac, AirPort, and Apple TV products.\n\nIn short Lucid team is comprised of leaders with decades of experience in lead roles in automotive and technology industries.\n\nNow, lets talk about the cars. Prior to the Lucid air, Lucid was known for Formula E racing. Lucid\u2019s technology arm Atieva develops and builds the battery packs powering every car on the grid in the world's leading electric racing championship field. Currently Lucid's lineup with consist of 4 models: The Air, available in 2022, from $77,400. Air Touring model, from $95,000 Air Grand Touring, from $139,000 Air Dream Edition, at $169,000 Lucid Air EV has a battery capacity of 113.0 kWh and a range reported as high as 517 miles. That is more efficient than the Model S Long Range Plus, which has a 98.0-kWh capacity and 402 miles of range. Lucid's Dream edition will also boast a modest 1080HP. Lucid currently has reached 10,000 preorders, representing over 650M in anticipated sales. Lucid expects 577 of these to be delivered this year.\n\nIn November, Lucid finished building the first phase of its factory in Casa Grande, Arizona, with the capacity to deliver up to 30,000 units per year initially, with up to 400,000 units annually in the future. The site sits on 590 acres allowing for additional expansion. The next phase expected to begin later this year \u2013 enabling production of Project Gravity, a premium SUV, and is expected to be fully produced and delivered by 2023.\n\nLucid is also backed by the wealthy Saudi PIF (Public Investment Fund). They will be the largest shareholder, however there are also other companies in the pipe. Including Fidelity Management &amp; Research, BlackRock, Neuberger Berman, Franklin Templeton, Wellington Management, and Winslow Capital Management.\n\nHowever I've been focusing on the Saudi Fund, they currently hold over 430B in assets, and for such an oil rich company to be backing an EV, if that doesn't scream bullish....The pipe shares will also be locked until at least September 1, so I would not expect a selloff this week.\n\nLucid Currently has 8 showrooms but has plans to open 20 by the end of this year throughout the U.S. and Canada. Long before the SPAC Lucid also promised the Saudi's to build in factory in Saudi Arabia. Talks are the factory would be located somewhere around Jeddah, which would be mark a very significant move as the Middle East shifts its economy from oil to EV's.\n\nAnyways this is my first attempt at a DD so....I'll be trying to read and respond to as many comments as I can.\n\nEdit: current positions 400 shares@27.27\nNot sure why its getting deleted? Help?",

        "selftext": "I bought INTC when I first started investing a few months ago when it was trading at $67, but looking back, I probably did so on past reputation instead of current situation (this was when I just learned how to research stocks, so I only looked at a few simple numbers like P/E ratio).\n\nI know the company right now isn't in the best of shape, having squandered its position atop the semiconductor totem pole, and while it's easy to kick it when it's down, is there anyone who truly believes that it can turn around and gain back what it's lost? Sure, it may take a year or more (barring a miracle), but we've seen AMD give Intel a run for its money before (though never to *this* degree), and Intel managed to recover. Plus, the current CEO looks like a huge upgrade over the last guy; not only is he an engineer, but he'd been with the company decades ago when it was just starting to become the behemoth it would eventually be.\n\nDo I have a valid reason to be hopeful, or is it just wishful thinking at this time because I can't stand to see the stock at $56 when I bought it for $67?",

        "selftext": "Part of me has never been more confident in the future of the semiconductors. At the same time I am worried Wall Street will be unimpressed with future earnings. A company can make a bazillion dollars in profit but if they say one bad thing then Wall Street throws a fit. \n\nRegardless of what Wall Street thinks, the future of technology is dependent on semiconductor chips. \n\nFor example Micron (MU). I thought their earnings call was very positive. They had a huge beat on earnings and it sounds like their future is very bright. The CEO made is clear that as cloud storage and EV vehicle usage increase in the coming years it will be very beneficial to Micron. The future of technology relies on cloud storage and the future of transportation is electric and computerized. Its concerning that MU went down over 5% on heavy volume today. Sure looks like a heavy resistance. \n\nThen you have Nvidia (NVDA). Arguably the industry leader and growing like crazy. They are still waiting on approval on the Arm deal which I would expect to go through. It recently brokeout HUGE. I mean what? Up 21% in one month for a company that size? Thats unreal. \n\nAMD just recently broke its trading range and on its way to 100. I am concerned that volume was not as big as it was when it broke through but the catalyst of the Xlyinx deal going through should be enough? Its apparent AMD is beating Intel in their sub-sector and Intel is over 100 billion large in market cap. Will AMD be able to continue the breakout? I dont know why they wont be able to. \n\nTSM has been consolidating for awhile. I cant see any reason it would break to the down side except for a hostile take over of Taiwan by China. Then either its game on between China or the US or the US backs down like they probably will cause, I mean it would be bad business for Apple, Starbucks, Tesla, Costco, and other American companies trying to grow in China. \n\nHow are all of you approaching this situation? If youre not thinking about this industry as a 6 month to 1 year play then idk what I am doing. I got call options on AMD and Mu expiring in October and December and a few in March of next year.",

From under $6 a share to over $90 a share is a huge achievement, especially in this market.\n\nAs we all know that AMD has been eating away at INTC server market share for a while now. It's about time that things should start getting accelerated, especially how INTC has failed overcome their challenges with 7nm design etc.\n\nAMD's ER is coming up on Tuesday, and I am against playing a binary event. There are simply too many factors in play. For instance, the FOMC meeting is in the same week, J Powell is speaking on Wednesday, which usually means a red day for market before the event.\n\nI really think that AMD is long overdue for  a boost to $100+ and it should happen soon after their ER.

If you use any technology at all, you\u2019ll probably know NVDA. Let\u2019s cut to the chase, after three days drop in a row (from 835 to 726), people are starting to ask: Is it a good time to buy the dip? Short answer is: Not yet, but close.   \nNote: there\u2019s an upcoming 4-for-1 stock split on 7/20.\n\nAbout NVDA \n\nObviously, graphic cards. Recently it\u2019s expanding in AI chips, supercomputers data centers, drug development, driverless car, aaaaaand last but not least: C\\_\\_p\\_\\_o Mining. They even made a C\\_\\_p\\_\\_o-mining-dedicated graphic card (CMP). In addition, with NVDA\u2019s newly developed CPU for high-end computing and AI applications, it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if NVDA became a major competitor of Intel and AMD. \n\nIs NVDA making money ACTUALLY?\n\nHell yeah it is. Here\u2019s a quick look   \nNVIDIA revenue for the quarter ending April 30, 2021 was $5.661B, a 83.8% increase year-over-year.  \nNVIDIA revenue for the twelve months ending April 30, 2021 was $19.256B, a 63.49% increase year-over-year.  \nNVIDIA annual revenue for 2021 was $16.675B, a 52.73% increase from 2020.  \nNVIDIA annual revenue for 2020 was $10.918B, a 6.81% decline from 2019.  \nThere\u2019s not much to say, it\u2019s got a really diversified and great business portfolio. \n\nIs NVDA worth investing/ trading?\n\nIf you have seen my previous articles on other stocks, you\u2019ll know I rarely feel so bullish and positive about a company like this one. NVDA will be the biggest part of my position in the near future. Great revenue growth potential, great new business outlook. When is a good time to buy you ask? Either long term or swing trade, I\u2019d probably wait until a bounce back AFTER the dip is CLEARLY over.",

        "selftext": " \n\nIn response to DD posted earlier today by [u/TheTendilorian](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheTendilorian/), I saw an opportunity to steal the show for myself. (Kidding, [u/TheTendilorian](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheTendilorian/) did fantastic work and you can find their post on $AMD financials rightttttttttt: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oe88ub/amd_su_bae_witness_me/h45ifrd/?context=3).\n\n$AMD is easily my fav stock and I'm perpetually bullish on it, however there's a lot of catalysts that will have effects on $AMD both negative and positive at all stages. I'm not passing this on as financial advice, just my opinions:\n\n**Chip Shortage**\n\nThis one is the most significant situation in regards to semiconductors and the wider tech industry. In many cases it helps the bullish argument since $AMD (and[ also $NVDA](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/nvda/earnings) but fuckem) continues to exceed earnings estimates despite the rough environment. The[ expansion of $TSMC into America](https://www.reuters.com/technology/tsmc-says-construction-has-started-arizona-chip-factory-2021-06-01/), in my opinion, is going to launch $AMD into the fuckin' stratosphere over the next couple of years. Though still based in Taiwan, TSMC is one of the biggest players in global semiconductor production. As of March, $AMD was [\u201cTSMC\u2019s number one customer in regard to purchasing 7nm wafers\u201d](https://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-overtakes-Apple-as-TSMC-s-main-7nm-customer.528532.0.html). \n\nAdditionally, let\u2019s talk about the economic giant we call China. I\u2019m an International Relations student so this is right up my ~~asshole~~ alley. While current President Biden has mentioned reversing some of the hardline policies of his predecessor President Trump, however there has been little evidence of progress towards that goal. Two weeks ago, the Biden Administration [blocked an attempt by a Chinese firm to purchase Korean chip manufacturer *Magnachip*](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/06/22/biden-semiconductors-south-korea-china-trade-war/). A small company, sure, but we can extrapolate this stance to assume that TSMC could be off limits to Chinese acquisition in the future if the US and Taiwan can come to a formal agreement. Who knows how long this US-China measuring contest will go on, but the evidence suggests to me that it would not drastically affect the prices of semiconductor companies. \n\nBeing the massive pussy that I am though, I'm concerned about how an impending crash will impact overall liquidity and the supply and demand of semiconductor chips,[ which computing technology consumes about 1/3 of](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/semiconductors/devices/how-and-when-the-chip-shortage-will-end-in-4-charts). But obviously if we all lose our homes, we would have bigger fish to fry than worrying about $AMD share price. \n\n**Innovation**\n\nI'm an avid PC gamer. I literally have nothing going on other than my Steam account and my Fidelity account. This is (not) a cry for help. IMO, $NVDA has the best net technology for GPUs. However $AMD offers more consumer-friendly products. I believe that $AMD cards offer the best value per dollar paid. (Unless you're one of those idiots paying 5 grand for a graphics card. I mean c\u2019mon, you can watch Pornhub Premium without an RTX 3080.) This catalyst is just going to be driven by overall consumer sentiment. If people begin realizing that their value is better spent on $AMD graphics cards, that[ market share](https://www.statista.com/statistics/754557/worldwide-gpu-shipments-market-share-by-vendor/) is gonna be gobbled the fuck up. Oh and processors? Yeah, $INTC is a piece of shit that I'm not concerned with. No source, just facts. Kidding, here\u2019s some cool charts [comparing processor performance](https://www.tomshardware.com/features/amd-vs-intel-cpus):\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nI won\u2019t lie, the new i9 5.1 GHz is an absolute beast, but the difference is almost negligible compared to the Ryzens, which are priced lower. \n\n**$NVDA Stock Split 20 June 2021**\n\nFuckin' $NVDA... always raining on the $AMD parade. I'm not angry, just disappointed. This stock split is actually pretty insignificant. Does this change any of the fundamentals between the two? Fuck no. Am I looking forward to it? Eh. Is there a point to me including this section? Kinda! As [u/TheTendilorian](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheTendilorian/) said to me, $AMD is a bit of a \u201clate-bloomer\u201d compared to $NVDA which can be seen as the current titan of the GPU space. I expect the price of $NVDA post-split (1:4) to be somewhere between $150 and $250 just based on previous prices and my exceptional arithmetic skills. While this is still above $AMD stock price, I think it will be easier to perform comparative technical analysis between the two companies when the prices are closer. Compare that with the fundamentals I wrote about earlier and you have got one bullish ass stock.\n\n**Price Outlook**\n\nIf I was Michael Burry and had enough coke and psilocybin I would tell you guys the price target a year from now. But I'm a broke college student with no coke and only a little shrooms, so it's whatever.\n\n\\- Short term I'm playing AMD calls pretty close to the chest. Currently holding 7/9 $95c and 8/20 $100c. I roll up or down depending on how the week has gone. $AMD has been trading sideways since the run-up last June with a high of $99.23 and a solid floor around $72-$73. For a quick swing of shares I try to enter anywhere under $80 and exit above\u2026 let\u2019s call it $86.50. As of now, I\u2019m looking out for an announcement stating the date of the Q2 earnings call (I\u2019m guessing August) and I\u2019m looking for $AMD to continue its run and retest $95 before a post-earnings dip. \n\nI\u2019ve charted pivot points for our current trading range as follows: \n\n$85.57\n\n$86.10\n\nPsychological resistance at whole values between $87 and $93.\n\n$93.55\n\n$95\n\nATH of 99.23\n\n \ud83d\udcf7 \n\n\\- Mid-term? I don't fucking know, get back to me if the market crashes. If not, 6-12months out, $100-$120 with a floor around $85-$90 just based on how we've been growing and the fact that resistance-&gt;support. As mentioned I\u2019m expecting a bit of a pullback soon since tech has been absolutely soaring the last two weeks, but seeing $85-$90 turn into support is not unreasonable in the near future. Honestly I\u2019m much more uncertain about mid-term compared to short or long time frames.\n\n\\- Long term: $NVDA levels. I believe with all my heart that $AMD is the better company and should be valued as such. They are a company that continues to exceed expectations and make great connections in the computing industry. For shares I would just buy and hold until I retire. (Mod who reviewed my post in its baby stages told me that \u201cbuy and hold\u201d was a questionable term to use. I\u2019ve heard the term \u201cinvesting\u201d passed around other subreddits but hell if I know what that means.) \n\n**Bottom Line**\n\nMe and my good pal Tendo heavily believe in this company, as I\u2019m sure many others do. No price target if I\u2019m going to take a 1+ yr position. Under $80 if I\u2019m going for a swing trade that will last one month or less. \n\nSo yeah, that's about it. Great DD[ u/TheTendilorian](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheTendilorian/). $AMD to the moon, not a financial advisor, blah-blah-blah. Who wants to see me lose half my portfolio this week? (Again.)",

        "selftext": "https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-build-qualcomm-chips-aims-catch-foundry-rivals-by-2025-2021-07-26/\n\nIntel Corp\u00a0(INTC.O)\u00a0said on Monday its factories will start building Qualcomm Inc\u00a0(QCOM.O)\u00a0chips and laid out a roadmap to expand its new foundry business to catch rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co\u00a0(2330.TW)\u00a0and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd\u00a0(005930.KS)\u00a0by 2025.\n\nAmazon.com Inc\u00a0(AMZN.O)\u00a0will be another new customer for the foundry chip business, said Intel, which for decades held the lead in technology for manufacturing the smallest, fastest computing chips.\n\nBut Intel has lost that lead to TSMC and Samsung, whose manufacturing services have helped Intel's rivals Advanced Micro Devices Inc\u00a0(AMD.O)\u00a0and Nvidia Corp\u00a0(NVDA.O)\u00a0produce chips that outperform Intel's. AMD and Nvidia design chips which then are made by the rival chip manufacturers, called foundries.\n\nIntel said on Monday it expects to regain its lead by 2025 and described five sets of chipmaking technologies it will roll out over the next four years.\n\nThe most advanced use Intel's first new design in a decade for transistors, the tiny switches that translate to digital ones and zeros. Starting as early as 2025, it will also tap a new generation of machines from the Netherlands' ASML\u00a0(ASML.AS)\u00a0that use what is called extreme ultraviolet lithography, which projects chip designs onto silicon somewhat like printing an old-fashioned photograph.\n\n\"We're laying out a whole lot of details to The Street to hold us accountable,\" Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger told Reuters in an interview, referring to investors.\n\nIntel also said it will change its naming scheme for chipmaking technology, using names like \"Intel 7\" that align with how TSMC and Samsung market competing technologies.\n\nIn the chip world where smaller is better, Intel previously used names that alluded to the size of features in \"nanometers\". But over time the names used by chipmakers became arbitrary marking terms, said Dan Hutcheson, chief executive of VLSIresearch, an independent semiconductor forecasting firm. This, he said, gave the mistaken impression that Intel was less competitive.\n\nIntel's first major customers will be Qualcomm and Amazon. Qualcomm, which dominates chips for mobile phones, will use what Intel is calling its 20A chipmaking process, which will use new transistor technology to help reduce how much power the chip consumes.\n\nAmazon, which is increasingly making its own data center chips for its Amazon Web Services, is not yet using Intel's chipmaking technology but will use Intel's packaging technology, the process of assembling chips and \"chiplets\" or \"tiles\", often stacking them up in so-called 3D formation. Intel excels in this packaging technology, analysts say.\n\n\"There have been many, many hours of deep and technical engagement with these first two customers, and many others,\" Gelsinger said.\n\nIntel did not give details how much revenue or manufacturing volume the customer wins would bring, though Gelsinger said during an event announcing the news that the Qualcomm deal involved a \"major mobile platform\" and engaging in a \"deep a strategic manner.\" Qualcomm has a long track record of using multiple foundry partners, sometimes even for the same chip.\n\nThe biggest question facing Intel is whether it can make good on its technology promises after years of delays under previous Chief Executive Brian Krzanich. In recent weeks, Intel announced the delay of a new data center chip called Sapphire Rapids.\n\nBut David Kanter, an analyst with Real World Technologies, said Intel is being more cautious than in the past. The years of delays resulted in part from the \"hubris\" of tackling multiple technical problems in a single generation of technology.\n\nThis time, Intel is laying out five generations of technology in four years, tackling smaller sets of problems, and also saying that it might not introduce the new EUV technology with its forthcoming \"Intel 18A\" process if it is not ready.\n\n\"Intel is absolutely going to catch up, and be ahead in some dimensions, with TSMC over the next few years,\" Kanter, the analyst, said. \"Intel really does have people who spend all their time looking at how to deploy new materials and technology to juice their performance.\"\n\nReporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by David Gregorio",

It gets 26% of revenue from China, 22.9% from Singapore, 21.3% from the United States, 14.9% from Taiwan, and 14.9% from other International markets.\n\n\\--\n\n**The Company**\n\nMarket Cap = $226.69B  \nTotal Debt = $35.88B  \nCash &amp; Equivalents = $22.40B  \nEnterprise Value = $238.66B  \nShares Outstanding = 4.038B  \nEV/Sales (LTM) = 3.1x\n\nSince Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce founded the company in 1968, Intel has grown to become the world\u2019s largest semiconductor chip manufacturer by revenue. The name comes from a contraction of \u201c*Int*egrated *El*ectronics\u201d. The company was the first to develop S/DRAM memory chips, and these represented most of its business in the early years.\n\nThrough the 1990s, the company invested heavily in microprocessor design and helped to drive the rapid growth of the personal computer industry. Regrettably, for punters late to the party in \u201899/\u201900, investors had already bid the stock price up exponentially in the tech bubble. These late punters paid the price during the ensuing collapse and period of price stagnation.\n\n[Investors bid up Intel\u2019s shares and then wiped them out through the tech bubble.](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa5699c62-f84c-4eb1-8df8-7568c261a101_2400x1164.png)\n\nAfter the tech bubble collapsed, growth in demand for microprocessors began to slow, and Intel\u2019s competitors (most notably AMD) began to etch away at their previously dominant market share. An attempt by then CEO Craig Barrett to diversify the company\u2019s business beyond semiconductors fell flat, and revenues stagnated for a few years.\n\n[Over the long term, Intel has continued to grow. The stock price is still below where it was during the height of the tech bubble, even though revenues and EBIT are almost double what they were then.](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0b7fd4c-5bd0-4f8e-8b84-2a53219ab442_3600x1747.png)\n\nThen, in 2005, Paul Otellini, then CEO, re-focused the company on their core processor and chipset business and signed a deal with Apple to provide the processors for Macintosh computers - a big win for Intel. Over the following 15 years, successful iterative improvements of the company\u2019s technology and the continued rapid growth of Apple helped Intel grow.\n\nIntel is a mature company with a dominant position, long-term stable margins, and slow structural growth.\n\n[Long-term stable margins and slow structural growth](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab8f5259-a0d5-4018-84e3-a9a2add3c701_2400x1166.png).\n\n\\--\n\n**The Story**\n\n*This mature semiconductor business has lost the Apple contract. After a substantial short-term hit, they will continue growing slowly and steadily, while their leading position and manufacturing capabilities will help them defend margins.*\n\n**Growth:** Intel has had an average CAGR of 5.7% since the mid-2000s. This growth has been broadly in line with market growth over this time and shouldn\u2019t be a surprise given Intel\u2019s dominant position, size and success of Apple products.\n\nHowever, looking forward, given that Apple announced it is transitioning away from Intel processors to in-house ones, we think this will deliver an immediate hit to revenues. Analyst consensus is for an FY21 loss of revenue of 6.7%, and we believe this is about right.\n\nFurther, economists estimate that the global client computing market and cloud data centre markets will grow at 0.1% and 19.0% CAGR, respectively, over the medium term. Based on Intel\u2019s segment weightings, this suggests ongoing medium-term market growth of 5.8%. Given the loss of the Apple contract and the fact that Intel has fallen behind on manufacturing, we think that medium-term growth is likely to be closer to the company\u2019s fundamental growth rate of 2.45%.\n\n**Margins:** Intel has had an average R&amp;D adjusted operating margin of 28.68% over the last ten years. This margin is far above the industry (weighted by segment) average of 14.62% over that time. Over the TTM, the company\u2019s margin was 29.91%.\n\nIntel\u2019s leading position in the microprocessor has helped them scale up and defend margins. The enormous R&amp;D and capital investment required to extend manufacturing processes and capacity for new products act as a consistent call on capital. They have helped act as significant barriers to entry. Intel is now one of a handful of remaining semiconductor companies with the capacity to manufacture chips internally.\n\nGiven this position, we expect Intel to maintain its current average margins by either pushing higher costs through to customers or improving manufacturing processes.\n\n**Net Reinvestment:** We expect Intel to remain an extremely capital intensive business (generating $0.61 of revenue per dollar of invested capital), especially compared to the industry ($1.71 of revenue per dollar of invested capital). Moreover, we expect their extraordinary R&amp;D requirements, which have averaged $13.5B p.a. over the last five years, will not diminish.\n\n**FCF:** But, given how profitable the business is, we expect it to remain highly FCF generative.\n\n**Cost of Capital:** Intel is a semiconductor and electronics business (66.2%) and a cloud services business (33.8%) serving China (26%), Singapore (22.9%), the United States (21.3%), Taiwan (14.9%) and other international markets (14.9%).\n\nThe company has a 0.2x average operating leverage ratio and a 15.7% D/E ratio. Moody\u2019s has assigned Intel an A1 credit rating, which is the same as our long-term synthetic rating but lower than our short-term rating of Aaa. We\u2019ve gone with the former because we agree with Moody\u2019s reasoning:\n\n&gt;\u201cDespite Intel's strong credit metrics, the rating is constrained by the relatively high operating and technology risk associated with leading-edge semiconductor design and manufacturing, and the volatility inherent to the semiconductor sector.\u201d  \n\u2014 Moody\u2019s Investors Services, 21 Sep 2020\n\nMoreover, the A1 rating drives the low (1.08%) chance of distress.\n\n**Other Assets &amp; Minority Claims:** Intel has $17M worth (at book) of investments carried under the equity method, $6.8B of investments held at fair value, and no minority claims outstanding.\n\n**Debts &amp; Other Claims:** Finally, the company owes $35.6B NPV in debts and leases.\n\n\\--\n\n**The Valuation**\n\nThe company reports in USD.

        "selftext": " \n\nIn July last year, HDVY filed an [infringement lawsuit](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200723005903/en/Health-Discovery-Corporation-Files-Infringement-Suit-Against-Intel-Corporation)  against Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC), which pertains to Health  Discovery\u2019s Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination methods  (SVM-RFE) patents. Previously, the US Patent and Trade Office (USPTO)  had declared an Interference between HDVY\u2019s SVM-RFE patent application  and Intel\u2019s Patent No. 7,685,077, entitled \u201cRecursive Feature  Eliminating Method based on a Support Vector Machine\u201d.\n\nIn February  2019, the USPTO ruled in favor of HDVY on the SVM-RFE patent  application. The Patent Trial and Appeal Board of the USPTO found that  HDVY is entitled to claim exclusive ownership rights to the SVM-RFE  technology as set forth in the SVM-RFE patent application that was filed  to provoke the Interference.\n\nThus, as a result of the issuance of  the SVM-RFE Patent, HDVY now has the right to exclude others from  developing, commercializing, or licensing this patented technology  without the uncertainty of the Interference or concerns over the  ownership of the SVM-RFE patents. In line with this, HDVY filed the  patent infringement lawsuit last year, as mentioned. In response, Intel  filed a motion to dismiss with the Court. HDVY filed a response in  opposition of Intel\u2019s motion to dismiss. At the end of last year, the  Court approved a scheduling order for the Infringement Lawsuit. One of  the items in the Scheduling Order was the Markman Hearing which was  scheduled for June 3, 2021. For those unfamiliar, a Markman Hearing is a  pretrial hearing in a United States District Court during which a judge  examines evidence from all parties on the appropriate meanings of  relevant keywords used in a patent claim.\n\nDuring the Markman  Hearing on June 3, 2021, the Court ruled in HDC\u2019s favor on all the  disputed claim terms and issued the Claim Construction Order. During the  Markman Hearing, the Court also spoke regarding Intel\u2019s pending motion  to dismiss. The Court will review and determine if a hearing is needed  on that motion or if it will rule on the previously filed pleadings.  According to the Scheduling Order, the next step is fact discovery,  which begins June 4, 2021.\n\nIn conclusion, HDVY is very close to  obtaining the full and exclusive rights for its patent and will make  Intel pay for its technology, which makes it a good OTC stock to hold  for the long term.",

        "selftext": "TL;DR - *price moves down on positive earnings for a complex options-play reason and you need to look at how within the expected move the price change was.*\n\nThis is a concept I'm still trying to get my head around as well, but it's generally true. Earnings seems like a confusing time, good earnings sends a price lower, stocks on bad earnings sends a stock higher, why is the world upside down?\n\nPerhaps someone can give a more technical explanation but it largely has to do with the ***bull put spread*** options strategy to capture expected moves.\n\nAn options trader in this strategy doesn't care that the price might go down somewhat - as long as it stays within the spread (**the expected move**) they make money. Quite handsomely.\n\nBecause an option's inherent volatility is dependent upon how negative the gamma is, as traders pile into ***puts*** to take advantage of the UPSIDE of a good earnings report while covering their potential downside, they cover their downside to within the expected range and not less.\n\nThey could cover it more but then you're eating at profits.\n\nAt the risk that if the expected range is bigger you lose everything (100%).\n\nSo as IV increases, gamma negativity increases which in turn means institutional investors **now need to sell stock when selling puts.**\n\nBecause institutional investors need to remain directionally neutral so they make money off the spread of selling puts and calls to buyers....to remain directionally neutral when their gamma is negative they need to sell.\n\nThis is why a BULLISH SENTIMENT drives the price like a tent peg right into the ground.\n\nIt's a temporary phenomenon of a very smart play where you can't lose as long as the earnings is bullish...you can easily lose if the surprise is negative and the sentiment turns bearish. But most people know when a stock is expected to have a good surprise and a company like INTEL was definitely bullish.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n* *A lot of bull put spreads were bought,* \n* *gamma became negative,* \n* *institutions with $billions invested had to sell short to remain directionally neutral,* \n* *price comes down.*\n* *Evaluation of bullishness is how close to within expected range a stock moves. The closer to the expected range the stronger the bullish sentiment on th earnings. After all 300% returns aren't free. If something is good, it gets squeezed down into 8% returns or so.*",

As we can see below SPY finished strongly with it rising 2.5% over the last week. As of Friday, 88% of the S&amp;P 500 companies that had reported second-quarter results exceeded analysts\u2019 earnings estimates \\[FactSet\\].\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/4znzaw4pldd71.png?width=1132&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41fcea7420fdd703438ab0ea78edd9f3bd16ae64)\n\nEven though there are some inflationary concerns, Fed is widely expected to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged\u2014and at a near-zero level\u2014when it concludes a two-day meeting on Wednesday.

Moderna is the newcomer to the top 10 list with a 22% jump in stock price. The controversy regarding the vaccine decision is accurately reflected in the sentiment with the stock having only 0.5% after having a very strong rally.

The company posted 293 MM global daily active users which is 23% more when compared to last year. Adding to this, the company also reassured the investors that they would not be impacted by the iOS 14.5 privacy changes as it had anticipated.\n\n**TAL Education Group(TAL):** TAL stock was down 70% on Friday following the news that the Chinese Govt might tell for-profit educational institutions to become non-profit organizations. As per CNBC reports, educational training institutions are banned from raising money through stock listings and foreign capital will not be allowed to invest. The news also caused other educational companies such as Youdao(DAO), Gaotu Techedu (GOTU), etc. to drop significantly.\n\n**Beachbody Company(BODY):** BODY has completed its three-way merger with Myx Fitness and Forest Road Acquisition Corp last month. This made it one of the largest subscription health and wellness companies for the mass market. The rising stock price and some very well-researched DD\u2019s ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/okfasr/beach_body_stock_is_it_gonna_boom/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oow4uo/bodybeachbody_a_deep_value_digital_and_connected/)) have contributed to the increasing chatter.\n\n**Intel Corporation(INTC):** Intel reported its quarterly earnings on Thursday. Even though the company beat revenue and EPS expectations, the stock price fell 2% following the cautionary guidance the company issued for the next quarter. Intel also said that PC unit sales were up 33% over last year. Investors were bullish on the stock predominantly because of the increasing focus the US govt has on fixing the semiconductor supply chain.\n\n**Moderna Inc(MRNA):** The company was trending and the stock price was rallying after European health officials recommended authorizing the drugmaker's coronavirus vaccine for kids 12 and older. This in addition to growing calls for a booster dose for newer covid variant\u2019s have pushed to stock price up. But the decision to vaccinate kids 12 and older was not well received by everyone as can be reflected in the sentiment. (There is a slight difference in sentiment between both the charts as the latter was pulled 6 hours later)\n\n**Until next week!**\n\n*As always, please note that I am not a financial advisor.*",

        "selftext": "I decided to get some long call position in Intel before they announce their earning on coming Thursday.\n\nI traded options professionally before and know how the industry works, in particular the **best-price rule**. We used to closely monitor our slippage (difference between the mid and ask/bid prices when buying/selling), and in case of any irregularities brought it up to our prime broker (GS and Interactive Brokers). I am still in my non-compete period and can't work for a competitor firm but am free to trade options on a personal account. Therefore I decided to explore the services of retail brokerages.\n\nI went for the OTM calls with strike closest to the price expiring on August 20th, as such having a great volume and low bid-ask spreads (3 cents), INTC 55.00. So I tried Gatsby digital mobile app. What I got was a fill at **85% above the ASK**!!! I naturally thought it was a mistake and got in touch with them. THeir reply was prompt and I was told it's \"a decision of the exchange..\" WTF? They don't even deal with option exchanges, their point of contact are market-makers, I know well how the system works so they can't just BS me!\n\nCan please someone advise whether it's normal in the retail trading world?? Has anyone faced a similar situation with gatsby or any other brokerage firm? What are my options in this situation? Would appreciate hearing about your experiences.

        "selftext": "so micron has a record ER, and guides higher but the market dumps.\n\nAnyone who has held Micron who a couple years knows this story. \n\nFor those who lost their ass on weeklies - this is why I say dont do weeklies on micron. \n\nWhy is it dumping? Partially because of people getting margin called and closing out their weeklies. STOP DOING IT. \n\nSo anyway on to the report:\n\n[https://investors.micron.com/static-files/a62938c1-846b-40e2-b0dc-d5e921c16c7e](https://investors.micron.com/static-files/a62938c1-846b-40e2-b0dc-d5e921c16c7e)\n\n \u25aa Expect CY-21 DRAM industry bit demand growth to be somewhat above 20%, with DRAM industry supply below demand; there is currently unmet demand for DRAM due to end market strength and we expect the DRAM market to remain tight into CY-22 \n\n\u25aa Expect CY-21 NAND industry bit demand growth in the mid 30% range, with NAND supply below demand; we also see the NAND market as tight into CY-22 \n\n\u25aa Long-term DRAM bit demand growth CAGR of mid-to-high teens \n\n\u25aa Long-term NAND bit demand growth CAGR of approximately 30% Micron \n\n\u25aa Targeting to align our long-term bit supply growth CAGR with the industry bit demand growth CAGR across DRAM and NAND \n\n\u25aa CY-21 DRAM and NAND Micron bit supply growth expected to be below industry demand growth \n\n\u25aa Placed orders for multiple EUV tools from ASML as part of long-term agreement \n\n\u25aa FY21 Capex revised to somewhat above $9.5 bn; mostly from areas that don\u2019t impact CY21 and CY22 bit growth such as EUV pre-payments, construction spending and other R&amp;D and corporate items \n\nNow during the call, analysts seemed to really dig in deep into Sanjays comments re purchasers shifting from \"just in time\" models to \"just in case\" models. They think this indicates previous purchases were above actual consumption and intended to raise inventory. As such they expect weakening demand and pricing moving forward. \n\nI disagree with their fears. Sanjay guides in a way so that he can smash at ER. He has done this for Micron and he has done with Sandisk before they got bought out at WDC. Have a look at previous earnings and whether they beat or not. \n\nexpand table to see more dates on links below\n\n[https://www.streetinsider.com/ec\\_earnings.php?q=sndk](https://www.streetinsider.com/ec_earnings.php?q=sndk) (Sanjay for all of it)\n\n[https://www.streetinsider.com/ec\\_earnings.php?sort=earning\\_date&amp;q=mu](https://www.streetinsider.com/ec_earnings.php?sort=earning_date&amp;q=mu) (Sanjay from Q3 2017)\n\nSanjay knows markets dont like surprise, so he guides low. Hes also been in Semi industry forever. Hes not an idiot. So when he says guidance is X, I take guidance to be X + extra for the beat. I dont freaking think I need to discount the guidance because purchasers increasing inventory. Sanjay has priced that shit in. \n\nSo thats inventory and guidance. \n\nWhat about the sale to Texas Instruments? Thats not linked to RAM or NAND really. Kinda but not really. Thats them giving up on (3dx point) Intel Octane. There was no market for it so keeping the plant was costing them 500 mil a year since it was under-utilised. However they kept all the IP from Octane in case it comes back to life later on. Its basically non volatile RAM which can be used as storage - sounds really cool but  I am guessing its expensive AF so people dont want it yet. Again, selling this plant is basically good for micron. We want higher margins to run a slick operation. \n\nI dont really like toms hardware but this article explains the sale the best. Other news stories on it say there was a sale but doesnt really tell you much about about the background.\n\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/uk/news/micron-to-sell-3d-xpoint-fab-to-texas-instruments-for-dollar900-million](https://www.tomshardware.com/uk/news/micron-to-sell-3d-xpoint-fab-to-texas-instruments-for-dollar900-million)\n\nWhat is driving increasing margin? Well Micron is using DUV (deep ultra violet) with computational lithography and multiple masks to achieve smaller resolution on DRAM. Samsung are achieving same resolution with EUV. EUV costs a bunch and ASML are the only supplier. You should probably get into ASML at some point as well WSB but thats a post for another day. As such, Microns margins for latest tech DRAM is way lower than Samsung. SK Hynix is the third player in RAM and they are playing catchup - seem a bit fucked to me personally. Nanya is the 4th player and realllllly small and think they are just screwed. Dont have the money to get into EUV so next few generations, they will be so far behind they just get bought out if any competition regulatory body allows it (at near bankruptcy stage is my guess). \n\nNow Micron is starting to invest in EUV which is good and they have given themselves a lead time for 2 years which feels about right to me. In 2023 we will see if they are still at cutting edge of RAM vs Samsung who will have a 2 year head start into EUV production. This is the only concern to me. In this time, they will gain the benefit of reduced pricing for EUV tech and additional expertise from ASML who will be helping Micron to achieve results. I am hoping they can transplant their specialist know how from DUV to EUV (that everyone else didnt manage to do at this resolution), but at this stage, my science ability is woefully unable to track it meaningfully.\n\nLets look at Microns plan for EUV and the interim releases until then.  \n\n[https://blocksandfiles.com/2020/12/01/micron-dram-node-shrink-roadmap/](https://blocksandfiles.com/2020/12/01/micron-dram-node-shrink-roadmap/)\n\nSo you can see we are currently at 1 alpha node for 10nm in 2021. We have 1 beta and 1 gamma to go planned (still using DUV) before 1 delta which is when EUV should kick in. Thats a new node every year still using DUV. Thats sweet if it works out. In the interim Micron gets to print money like nobodys business (higher margin from DUV) and continue hiring R&amp;D people with EUV knowledge from Korea and Japan. \n\nI have a small long position in micron. I dont really care about short term price movements. I expect this to be higher in 3 to 6 months. Thats what I care about. I expect it to be higher in 12 months. Beyond that I want to see how their 1 beta and 1 gamma nodes are coming along with updates as to 1 delta using EUV. \n\nWe are trading at price levels from Jan/Feb this year. We have had 2 great ERs since then. I dont see TAM in RAM or NAND dropping any time soon or pricing (thesis of tacit collusion as to supply/pricing in oligopolies - we arent cyclical market anymore because 3 market players control like 98% of the DRAM production in the world - its why they are not dumping on capex - its intentional). \n\nthis is good price to buy, but dont expect results in a week or even a month. We might trade sideways for a while. Shake out the paper hands before funds buy back in at discount and ramp up for next ER. You cant time the ramp up, you just have to be in the stock at a decent price (like now) and then wait for it to happen.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, July 28, 2021**\n\nThe market staged another remarkable reversal today, with many names that were hit yesterday clawing back their losses. The three major indexes were mixed, with Nasdaq (QQQ) climbing 0.35%. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) dipped towards the end of the session to close 0.6%  down. The Dow Jones (DIA), which tracks industrial and financial stocks, fell 0.37%. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, outperformed, rising 1.53% at the time of writing. Just like last Monday, today demonstrates that, while there are risks present in the market, investors and traders remain eager to buy up every dip.\n\nToday, market participants continue to digest a slew of earnings reports, with three of the largest companies in the market, Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) reporting yesterday. Today, after-hours, Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL) are reporting, among many others. \n\nMoreover, market participants also eyed the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) July Monetary Policy Report, which largely reiterated what members of the Fed have been saying for months, but did include some new language hinting that the economic recovery is getting closer to the Fed\u2019s stated goals. The statement read, \u201cLast December, the Committee indicated that it would continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage\u2011backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward its maximum employment and price stability goals. Since then, the economy has made progress toward these goals, and the Committee will continue to assess progress in coming meetings.\u201d In other words, the Fed says substantial progress has been made and that in the coming months, we will increasingly begin to hear more about a timeline to taper quantitative easing. \n\nOn inflation, the statement largely reiterated what it has in months past. The statement read, \u201cInflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses\u201d and \u201cThe Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation having run persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer\u2011term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved.\u201d\n\nHowever, the report did acknowledge potential risks and stated the Fed was ready to act if \u201cappropriate risks arise\u201d. The statement read, \u201cIn assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.\u201d\n\nRead the entire July FOMC statement here: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210728a.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210728a.htm)\n\nShares of Facebook (FB) fell 5% after-hours despite largely beating analyst after the company warned of a significant slowdown moving forward. Here are the numbers.\n\n* **Earnings:** $3.61 per share, adjusted, vs. $3.03 per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.\n* **Revenue:** $29.08 billion, vs. $27.89 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.\n* **Daily active users (DAUs):** 1.91 billion, vs. 1.91 billion as expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.\n* **Monthly active users (MAUs):** 2.90 billion, vs. 2.91 billion as expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.\n* **Average revenue per user (ARPU):** $10.12, vs. $9.66 as expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.\n\nImportantly, however, with respect to guidance, Facebook warned of a significant deceleration in growth moving forward. The company said it expects \u201cyear-over-year total revenue growth rates to decelerate significantly on a sequential basis as we lap periods of increasingly strong growth.\u201d\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Twitter (TWTR) stock surged roughly 5% before moderating after the company announced it was testing a new feature called the \u201cShop Module\u201d that would enable businesses to sell their products directly through the Twitter platform. \n* Quarterly revenue for LinkedIn, the professional social network owned by tech giant Microsoft, surpassed $1 billion in the quarter for the first time.\n* Youtube, which is owned by Alphabet, reported revenues of $7 billion for the quarter. To put into context how massive YouTube really is, Netflix (NFLX) had $7.3 billion in revenue this quarter, which has a $230 billion market-cap. It\u2019s funny, in a world where the competition between streaming services for professional content is becoming increasingly more saturated, YouTube is poised to become and doesn\u2019t spend billions to produce and acquire content. \n* Shares of chip-maker AMD gapped up today after the company beat earnings estimates and raised guidance moving forward that suggests the company will continue to take market share away from Intel. As I\u2019ve said before, I think AMD and NVDA are the kings of this space.\n* Chinese stocks gapped up today after a massive, across the board sell-off. \n* Microsoft (MSFT) earnings Yesterday\n   * **Revenue:** $46.15 billion versus $44.25 billion expected\n   * **Earnings per share:** $2.17 versus $1.92 expected\n   * **Productivity and Business Processes:** $14.69 billion versus $13.9 billion expected\n   * **Intelligent Cloud:** $17.38 billion versus $16.4 billion expected\n   * **More Personal Computing:** $14.09 billion versus $13.8 billion expected\n* Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) earnings yesterday\n   * **Earnings per share (EPS):** $27.26 vs $19.34 per share\n   * **Revenue:** $61.88 billion vs $56.16 billion\n   * **YouTube advertising revenue:** $7.00 billion vs $6.37 billion expected\n   * **Google Cloud revenue:** $4.63 billion vs $4.40 billion expected, \n   * **Traffic acquisition costs (TAC):** $10.93 billion vs $9.74 billion expected\n* Apple (AAPL) earnings yesterday\n   * **EPS**: $1.30 vs. $1.01 estimated \n   * **Revenue**: $81.41 billion vs. $73.30 billion estimated, up 36% year-over-year \n   * **iPhone revenue**: $39.57 billion vs. $34.01 billion estimated, up 49.78% year-over-year \n   * **Services revenue**: $17.48 billion vs. $16.33 billion estimated, up 33% year-over-year \n   * **Other Products revenue**: $8.76 billion vs. $7.80 billion estimated, up 40% year-over-year \n   * **Mac revenue**:$8.24 billion vs. $8.07 billion estimated, up 16% year-over-year \n   * **iPad revenue**: $7.37 billion vs. $7.15 billion estimated, up 12% year-over-year \n   * **Gross margin**: 43.3% vs. 41.9% estimated \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Apple (AAPL) with a host of target raises.

They have a wide diversity of product applications across many industries. Industries include consumer electronics, health and wellness, aerospace automotive, and clean energy. META has changed the manufacturing process of chips. If NanoWeb can be used with any metal, including silicon, then imagine how much you can save on semiconductor chips. Instead of making full silicon discs, companies could use a plastic wafer and print the NanoWeb onto it. META's NanoWeb and holoOPTIC technology is unparalleled to the current competition. Their technology can be produced faster and cheaper than competitors. Their technology is way beyond our current imagination. \n\n\tThe semiconductor chip shortage is a sign. Chips are going to be as essential to our everyday lives as water. The shortage showed the U.S that they are behind the curve. The U.S wants to be in the position to not only supply themselves with chips but also export them to other countries. Biden's $50B plan will play a strategic role in controlling chip supply. META will also seek to capitalize on the semiconductor chip boom. The RML tech will change semiconductor chip manufacturing. This is a great long-term investment. Potentially one of the best silicon stocks to buy. Also, check out the \\[META homepage\\](https://metamaterial.com/). The video up on their homepage goes hard. \n\nFor more information on META, check out their investor deck \\[here.\\](https://metamaterial.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/META-Investor-Deck-FINAL-JULY-2020-4.pdf)\n\n*Disclaimer: This is not investment advice.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, July 23, 2021**\n\nStocks continued their remarkable rally today, wildy reversing after Monday\u2019s decline to surge higher for the fourth consecutive day, with the three major indexes once again approaching record levels. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) both rose more than 1%, while the Dow Jones (DIA) traded 0.7% higher at the time of writing. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small caps, reversed from yesterday\u2019s session to trade 0.4% higher at the time of writing, once again proving that market participants remain eager and able to buy up any dips. \n\nIt seems market participants continue to weigh a variety of factors, including but not limited to: (1) faster-than-expected pace of economic recovery, (2) surging corporate earnings, (3) potential inflationary pressures, (4) labor market imbalances, and (5) concerns surrounding the coronavirus delta variant. Basically, the market is balancing between expectations for rapid economic expansion moving forward and concerns surrounding inflation and the delta variant.\n\nYesterday,  the Labor Department released the Weekly Unemployment report, which unfortunately, showed an unexpected rise in new jobless claims filed. New jobless claims jumped to 419,000, well above consensus estimates of 360,000 and a sharp jump from the previous week, which showed pandemic-era lows in claims filed. Since the beginning of the pandemic, market participants have closely tracked these numbers in order to gauge the health of the labor market. However, with rising infections threatening to trigger new restrictions, labor market reports have taken on more importance than usual.\n\nMark Hamrick, Senior Economic Analyst at Bankrate said, \u201cWith the recent resurgence in COVID cases stemming from the Delta variant, the jump in jobless claims is a disappointment. Recovery is never a perfect straight line.\n\nWhile Monday may have preoccupied market participants, Q2 earning season continues and is shaping up to be another record-setting quarter, with most companies surging past earnings estimates. This week, we have seen Chipotle (CMG), Coca-Cola (KO), Verizon (VZ), Twitter (TWTR), Snap (SNAP), Southwest (LUV), among others beating earnings. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data \u2013 an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be \"need to be revised higher.\" \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Chinese stocks fell as a whole today due to fears that the Chinese Communist Party will continue to penalize its tech companies. In the latest move, the CCP brought the hammer down on ride-hailing company Didi, with reports coming that the company will be hit with a massive fine of more than $2.8 billion, which would break the record paid by Alibaba (BABA) earlier this year, and threats that include suspending certain company operations and forcing the withdrawal of US-listed shares. Didi is down roughly 50% since its IPO on June 30.\n* U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, fell to a four-month low of 59.7 from 63.7 in June. A reading above 50 indicates growth.\n* Members of the US Federal Reserve are set to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday of this week in order to debate the timeline to taper quantitative easing and the potential risks around the resurging Delta variant\n* Shares of Intel (INTC) gapped down despite smashing earnings estimates after reporting its outlook, which suggests the company will continue to lose market share to other competitors, mainly AMD and Nvidia (NVDA).\n* Shares of Snap (SNAP) rocketed up after the company smashed earnings, with revenue more than doubling compared to last year and the company raising guidance moving forward. Twitter (TWTR) beat as well but not as dramatically.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Biogen (BIIB) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $453 to $455 at Overweight.

They have a wide diversity of product applications across many industries. Industries include consumer electronics, health and wellness, aerospace automotive, and clean energy. META has changed the manufacturing process of chips. If NanoWeb can be used with any metal, including silicon, then imagine how much you can save on semiconductor chips. Instead of making full silicon discs, companies could use a plastic wafer and print the NanoWeb onto it. META's NanoWeb and holoOPTIC technology is unparalleled to the current competition. Their technology can be produced faster and cheaper than competitors. Their technology is way beyond our current imagination. \n\n\tThe semiconductor chip shortage is a sign. Chips are going to be as essential to our everyday lives as water. The shortage showed the U.S that they are behind the curve. The U.S wants to be in the position to not only supply themselves with chips but also export them to other countries. Biden's $50B plan will play a strategic role in controlling chip supply. META will also seek to capitalize on the semiconductor chip boom. The RML tech will change semiconductor chip manufacturing. This is a great long-term investment. Potentially one of the best silicon stocks to buy. Also, check out the \\[META homepage\\](https://metamaterial.com/).

        "selftext": "The LCID merger has been completed and the ticker change will be happening Monday 7/26. So lets start up with the background on the company.\n\nLeadership: Peter Rawlinson: Current CEO/CTO - Peter has over 30 years of automotive experience. Prior to Lucid, Peter was Vice President of Vehicle Engineering at Tesla and Chief Engineer of the Model S, where he led the engineering of the Model S.\n\nDerek Jenkins: Senior Vice President of Design and Brand - Before joining Lucid, Derek was the Director of Design at Mazda North America Operations where he oversaw all design developments locally and globally. He also spent nine years as the Chief Designer for Volkswagen North America, and eight years with Audi, serving first as Lead Exterior Designer, followed by Assistant Chief Designer for Audi Design.\n\nMichael Bell: Most recently, Michael was Chief Technology Officer for Rivian. He has 30 years in the tech field includes 16 at Apple and five at Intel. At Apple, he played significant roles in the development of iPhone, iMac, AirPort, and Apple TV products.\n\nIn short Lucid team is comprised of leaders with decades of experience in lead roles in automotive and technology industries.\n\nNow, lets talk about the cars. Prior to the Lucid air, Lucid was known for Formula E racing. Lucid\u2019s technology arm Atieva develops and builds the battery packs powering every car on the grid in the world's leading electric racing championship field. Currently Lucid's lineup with consist of 4 models: The Air, available in 2022, from $77,400. Air Touring model, from $95,000 Air Grand Touring, from $139,000 Air Dream Edition, at $169,000 Lucid Air EV has a battery capacity of 113.0 kWh and a range reported as high as 517 miles. That is more efficient than the Model S Long Range Plus, which has a 98.0-kWh capacity and 402 miles of range. Lucid's Dream edition will also boast a modest 1080HP. Lucid currently has reached 10,000 preorders, representing over 650M in anticipated sales. Lucid expects 577 of these to be delivered this year.\n\nIn November, Lucid finished building the first phase of its factory in Casa Grande, Arizona, with the capacity to deliver up to 30,000 units per year initially, with up to 400,000 units annually in the future. The site sits on 590 acres allowing for additional expansion. The next phase expected to begin later this year \u2013 enabling production of Project Gravity, a premium SUV, and is expected to be fully produced and delivered by 2023.\n\nLucid is also backed by the wealthy Saudi PIF (Public Investment Fund). They will be the largest shareholder, however there are also other companies in the pipe. Including Fidelity Management &amp; Research, BlackRock, Neuberger Berman, Franklin Templeton, Wellington Management, and Winslow Capital Management.\n\nHowever I've been focusing on the Saudi Fund, they currently hold over 430B in assets, and for such an oil rich company to be backing an EV, if that doesn't scream bullish....The pipe shares will also be locked until at least September 1, so I would not expect a selloff this week.\n\nLucid Currently has 8 showrooms but has plans to open 20 by the end of this year throughout the U.S. and Canada. Long before the SPAC Lucid also promised the Saudi's to build in factory in Saudi Arabia. Talks are the factory would be located somewhere around Jeddah, which would be mark a very significant move as the Middle East shifts its economy from oil to EV's.\n\nAnyways this is my first attempt at a DD so....I'll be trying to read and respond to as many comments as I can.",

        "selftext": "Let me start by saying that an amazing DD post was written by u/SlowRyder about this merger and [can be found right here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/of6h61/holley_empw_an_immediately_undervalued_profitable/)  I highly recommend reading that because he did a great job at compiling a lot of financial data that you'd likely want before investing.  However, I'd like to add a little bit of \"boots on the ground\" intel that is purely opinion based and anecdotal but may be worthwhile to know as well before investing.\n\n**TLDR: Holley and the associated brands of Holley make up a huge chunk of all aftermarket parts used by automotive hobbyists to make the cars louder, faster, or both, and this is for cars dating back to the 1960's all the way through present.  This is one of the few SPACs that merged with ACTUAL companies that have ACTUAL products in use and on shelves now that has ACTUAL sales (*****and at a fair valuation IMO after I scrutinized things a bit*****).**\n\n# Intro: I'm Just A Regular Guy\n\nI want to start by saying that I'm not a financial guru but rather just a regular dude that enjoys motorcycle racing which means that I tend to mingle around a lot of people that enjoy auto racing.  A typical moto race day starts by arriving to the track with motorcycles as the people that are just leaving from their auto racing day are packing up their trailers.  The number of car trailers sporting Holley, Flowmaster, Hurst, B&amp;M, and/or Hurst stickers on it is pretty noticeable.  I'd guesstimate 1 in 3 trailers are repping at least one (*usually more, though*) of those brands on their trailer.  \n\n# Back Of The Envelope Math\n\nAgain, auto racing isn't really my thing but I'm going to guess that the average part from one of those companies is $500-750.  I'll then guess that the average vehicle has 4-5 of those parts installed so that's going to mean that their average loyal customer is potentially spending a few thousand dollars on their products easy.  \n\n&gt;Let's consider an example here:  A guy has an older Corvette that he enjoys some hobby racing with.  He's got Holley carburetors or fuel injection system (*complete upgraded system is a few different parts in a kit*) and then once he's dumping more fuel into the car he's also going to upgrade the air intake as well as the exhaust outflows.  Figure one kit for the air intake, one kit for the fuel delivery, and another kit for the exhaust outflows.  Holley for fuel, Flowmaster for exhaust, and one of their other brands for an intake?  Probably a new chip for the car's computer too to properly run all this new crap he just installed, ***so a total of 4-5 new components and easily $3-4k spent on the parts.***\n\nOne thing that made me a little skeptical at first was that Holley (and the associated brands) are mostly being used on older (ie: cheaper) cars but after doing a little more internet trolling of some auto enthusiasts forums I'd say a fair number of their customers are buying products for late model American muscle cars too.\n\nI feel it's important to state something that wasn't obvious to me at first but became more apparent as I dug around more: Just like motorcycles are niche, auto enthusiasts are a small group too... ***BUT PER CAPITA THEY SPEND A TON ON THEIR CARS!***  You take the figures from above and then consider a lot of these customer have a daily car, a weekend car, and maybe even a dedicated track car too, and all of them have probably been modified anywhere from mild to wild.\n\nIn other words, Holley doesn't need all 330M people in the US to be their customers, but rather they want a healthy percentage of the people that modify their vehicles to be doing so using one of their many brands.  Whereas other SPAC deals require multi-million or multi-billion dollar spending plans for their product or service to scale up (cough cough I'm looking at you EV-hype companies) this is just a straight forward Warren Buffett type deal... a consumer staple play where the sales are already there, the customer base is already there, **and best of all they don't need to convince customers that what they're selling is valuable!**\n\nFor more data and figures I again suggest reading the DD posted a couple weeks ago by SlowRyder that I linked above because he provided TONS of great analysis.\n\n# Two Premium Brands: Dinan &amp; AEM\n\nI want to briefly touch on two of their collection of brands that I feel deserve special mentions: Dinan and AEM.\n\nDinan is one of a handful of aftermarket parts manufacturers that make up the ultra-premium products for BMW street and race cars.  Do a little mental exercise with me here... Think about somebody you know that owns a BMW performance car (*M3, M4, M anything, 335ci turbo anything, etc*) and think about how pretentious and snobby they are about their \"Ultimate Driving Machine\"... Dinan sells to those people and has for decades and for many of their parts they're considered the gold standard.  When you're selling parts for premium cars you're selling products with an added premium on the price, obviously, and for those customers the higher cost items are actually a source of bragging rights.  In only know a couple BMW guys but they are hardcore into only a few brands to touch their \"special\" cars and Dinan is one of them.  \n\nAEM is another brand they recently acquired and it's also got the premium feel, but for almost all auto manufacturers instead of just one niche German company (*though admittedly I think they're bigger with Japanese car folks instead of domestic, again just anecdotally)*.  If you see a modified Acura, Toyota, Honda, Subaru, etc it is likely you'll find an AEM part or two on the car unless its: 1) Modified with dogshit eBay parts, or 2) Modified with ultra-ultra-ultra premium brands like Bride, Spoon, Mugen, and some others you've never heard of unless you're into cars.\n\nThis is to say that Holley has many brands but a small number of them punch higher than their weight class when it comes to value for price.  Or price for value depending on how you look at it.  Warren Buffett may be weary of this because he prefers cheap and necessary vs expensive and ancillary but Holley owns brands that offer something for everyone across all price points.\n\n# My Concluding Thoughts\n\nI have held or still hold a handful of former SPAC companies that I see a lot of future potential in.  Like many of you I have seen all of those holdings decrease in value over the past months but when I bought the shares I didn't expect a quick cash-out anyway.  \n\nI know many enjoyed SPACs for the \"pops\" after DA, merger, etc but **I prefer to be more selective with what business combos I felt good about and EMPW's merger with HLLY happens to be one of those deals.**  I am certain this has caused me to miss out on gains but I also didn't have my account blown up when SPACs shit the bed.  I mention this because I think that anybody considering an investment into HLLY should have a longer time horizon, perhaps several months to over a year.  \n\nFor all the reasons above plus all the reasons found in the DD I linked above I think this is one worth considering.  I'm posting my position just below so as to disclose that **I own commons, as well as warrants**, and while I am already up \\~10% in only a couple weeks I'm nowhere close to selling at this point.  Volume has been super slim pre and post merger which tells me institutions/people are holding for the value reasons that I see too and I am sincerely hopeful that this will offer strong returns long-term.  **My personal time horizon is 1+ years unless something dramatically changes.**\n\nToday's closing price on commons was $10.94 and warrants were $2.40 so I believe there is plenty of meat left on the bone for people who choose to invest now.  Happy SPACing, friends!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Commons Position Disclosure Screenshot ](https://preview.redd.it/lqai05h5huc71.jpg?width=643&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52f2a05b660b65f8122d44ae90c960586d54b46e)",

        "selftext": "Hey folks, as you may gather from my post history I am long both $MNMD and $CYBN - the notable difference between these positions is that for MindMed I am better able to allocate my USD holdings using a [LEAPS strategy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leaps.asp#:~:text=Long%2Dterm%20equity%20anticipation%20securities%20\\(LEAPS\\)%20are%20publicly%20traded,with%20longer%20times%20until%20expiration.). For those who are unfamiliar LEAPS stands for Long-term Equity Anticipation Securities, the strategy involves buying one or more options with expiration dates longer than one year. As an investor there are a few advantages:\n\n1. You gain exposure to 100 shares \n1. It costs less to buy the option vs. 100 shares outright \n\nSo in the case of $MNMD buying 500 shares @ 3.41 = $1705 where as buying 5 x $MNMD Jan20'23 2.5C options = $1125. The difference of $580 allows me to take that money and invest it else where. I decided to use this strategy for a few reasons:\n\n1. I wanted to have capital on hand to invest in other areas of the market (this funded another LEAPS trade for me $INTC Jan20'23 $65C)\n1. The call is already in the money, my personal view is that MindMed will appeciate greatly over the next two years\n1. Unusual option activity was flagged on this particular option - a service I use ([unusual whales](https://unusualwhales.com/referral#87416349-bde8-4f68-8853-e9cafc3ec82c)) fired an alert on May 25th that a large volume of these particular calls were being purchased\n1. Further diligence is showing a lot of bullish call option activity for $MNMD \n\nAs I look ahead to other areas in the industry where I'm making investments, I will probably use a similar strategy. Mostly because this strategy will allow me to cost effectively build a larger position in MindMed while having cash to buy up additional shares in other companies which are not listed on US exchanges. \n\nThere is a lot of great information on youtube about trading options and LEAPS, here are two good examples that you should check out if you're unfamiliar:\n\n* Option Basics (Great if you're using Robinhood) via [Benjamin's Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW5927_LPUs)\n* [LEAPS Are Supreme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FNTfJ7Usy4) &amp; [Maximize Your Portfolio Potential](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95suqaJcFtU) both videos by \"InTheMoney\" - who creates excellent trading content \n\nIs anyone else using LEAPS to build their positions? Hope this is helpful to some of the new comers in the space!",

        "selftext": "# DEAR APES,\n\nAnother weekly update on AMD.\n\nSince my last post, we broke $90 and came up to $95... now we hit Wave 4, as we get ready **RISE**!\n\nIf you know anything about Elliot Wave (I suggest you research it)... Wave 4 is here.\n\nBasically, we will consolidate for a couple of days before the **sky-rocketing WAVE 5** towards $97.97.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**On the Technical Analysis:** \"I heart stock charts\" on youtube does a great job following AMD.\n\nHe anticipated yesterday's drop (Wave 4, with a 4% drop) and even today's continuation to $89.49.

(that **fuel** the rise).\n\nThere's interesting news since my last post:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# #1- Intel announced a DELAY on its 7nm manufacturing plan.\n\nThis is great news for AMD: [https://www.protocol.com/intel-7nm-chip-delay](https://www.protocol.com/intel-7nm-chip-delay)\n\n[INTEL announced a NEW delay on its 7nm process](https://preview.redd.it/p77kemk630a71.jpg?width=1159&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ccb08ed1567ee4f1b6d9b9c77c315da5d9b3c3b4)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# #2- AMD consumer sales remain STRONG (Amazon)\n\nHere's today's sales chart, directly from AMAZON... where AMD dominates the TOP 10.\n\n[AMD has 8 positions from the Top 10 sales](https://preview.redd.it/6g6uuy1w30a71.jpg?width=1882&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b36234479fc5dafef09b0d277d4712c11d4b0aa2)\n\nInteresting to note the amount of reviews AMD products receive in contrast to the 2 Intel chips.\n\nI've highlighted in the color boxes the AMD chip review numbers vs Intel.\n\nIn short, Intel has a total 3,222 combined reviews on their #7 and #8 spots.\n\nWhile AMD has 101,795 reviews. Consumers are **VERY HAPPY** with AMD products.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# #3- AMD Fidelity FX Super Resolution to GROW (July 16th).\n\nAs reported by Coreteks yesterday, more games will receive AMD FX Super Resolution next week.\n\nIn addition, the Radeon 6600XT is planned for launch next month (August).\n\nAs per his estimates, FSR will let you hit **60 FPS** at **4K** with **Ultra Quality** on the 6600XT.\n\n[Coreteks' report](https://preview.redd.it/q2w48evd50a71.jpg?width=1897&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e91039f1f2749acc5ca92c1e639a61a54821110)\n\n**Coretek's awesome video**: : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msNiyDsDVsA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msNiyDsDVsA)\n\nThis is awesome news for AMD's entry GPU... which will be **SOLD-OUT immediately** on launch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# #4 - AMD grows on SuperComputer Ranking (NEW June list)\n\nAs reported recently, Intel has been dropping in the SuperComputer (Datacenter) market.\n\n[INTEL falls in Datacenter](https://preview.redd.it/twtkltha60a71.jpg?width=1670&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=abc32d39542548206263b8f3d879b76db04521be)\n\nArticle: [https://www.networkworld.com/article/3623750/intel-stumbles-in-supercomputer-rankings-delays-next-gen-cpu.html](https://www.networkworld.com/article/3623750/intel-stumbles-in-supercomputer-rankings-delays-next-gen-cpu.html)\n\nIn addition, there's a **really good video** from ServeTheHome ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd1H-I-i-68](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd1H-I-i-68)), where he analyzed the latest SuperComputers list.\n\n[AMD Walloped Intel on June's 2021 Top 500 SuperComputer List](https://preview.redd.it/c6mmrga570a71.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ff78b30908f538b62063825d9bc9847f89f9d36)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# #5 - Valuation versus NVIDIA: AMD is still CHEAP\n\nToday, AMD's real competitor is NVIDIA.\n\nFrom a market capitalization perspective, NVIDIA trades at roughly $500 billion.\n\nWhile AMD is trading at $108 billion... a fifth of NVIDIA's size.\n\nThis is ridiculously cheap, at AMD's P/E ratio is much lower and the future outlook is great.\n\nWhile NVIDIA's acquisition of ARM is still being questioned by huge players (Google, etc.)... AMD received **green lights from EVERYONE** to acquire XILINX.\n\nThis acquisition will be great for AMD, as the automotive sector goes through a revolution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# To summarize:\n\n**#1- INTEL continues to have delays on 7nm**\n\n**#2- AMD continues to dominate the Consumer CPU market**\n\n**#3- AMD Fidelity FX Super Resolution increasing ADOPTION by developers. GPU launch soon!**\n\n**#4- AMD continues to GROW in Datacenter... kicking INTEL's rear.**\n\n**#5 - AMD still CHEAP versus NVIDIA**\n\n# WE ONLY NEED TO RIDE OUT WAVE 4 and pack our bananas...\n\n# WAVE 5...

        "selftext": "Full disclosure: I'm an AMD fanboy. I have been AMD fanboy since 2013. My last PC was full AMD build and my current PC is full AMD build. I love AMD. My only regret was not getting into stocks 5 years ago. I would have happily brought AMD when they were 10usd per stock. :P\n\nBut I do not own stock in intel nor AMD. At least, not yet. All my funds are tied up else where.\n\nNow, if you haven't been following PC hardware news. AMD has been killing it with their ryzen series. That launched in 2016. Their current gen hardware is better intel by power and price. PC enthusiasts absolutely love the ryzen series. You can clearly see this on tech side of youtube. Top of that, AMD secured partnership with gaming consoles. All good stuff, right?\n\nMeanwhile, before 2016. Intel was considered the KING. They have connections everywhere throughout the technology world. Intel is known for quality. But now with the release of AMD's ryzen series. They're no longer the king with PC enthusiasts. But Intel still has strong connections with other companies. Their business model has raked in A LOT of money. And they're currently sitting on a lot of money.\n\nIntel has less debt than AMD.\n\nWhat I don't understand is why AMD is sitting at 90usd and intel is sitting at 56usd.(as of today) The price different is staggering considering both companies have done really well because of the pandemic. Many people brought new desktop and laptops to work from home or school. (Myself included)\n\nNow, you might say.\n\nWell, the ryzen series is why there is a huge price difference.\n\nAnd yeah, that's a fair point. Intel is currently on their back heels, they're currently being forced to cut prices on products just to compete. But even with price cuts, intel has big price margins. So they're still making money even with price reductions. I would value the AMD 10usd higher than Intel just for that reason. Not 40usd difference.\n\nBut AMD has GPU too!\n\nVery true. And AMD GPU have been selling extremely well because of the pandemic. But only because of the pandemic. Their competitor, Nvidia. Has dominated the GPU market for decades. And Nvidia's current generation of cards, RTX 30xx series. Is currently the most desired GPU card on the market. Not just by gamers, but also crypto miners. If there wasn't a global chip shortage or scalpers. PC enthusiasts would buy Nvidia cards right now. (myself included.)\n\nNow, does that still jusify AMD's current price? I don't think so. According to steam hardware surveys.\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/\n\nIntel has 70% of CPU market place. There appears to be a slight tread downwards in market share. But intel is still owns 70% after 5 years of AMD's Ryzen series reigning supreme.\n\nTop of that, AMD only owns 15% of the GPU market. While Nvidia almost 80% of the market. And crazy enough, intel own 8% of market! That's half of what AMD's market.\n\nSo why is AMD at 90usd? While intel sits at 56usd. I believe AMD's current price was driven by an influx of new traders in 2020.\n\nI honestly believe AMD is overpriced and not worth 90usd. I don't have any target prices for intel or AMD. I'm not that smart. But my gut would say, Both companies should be closer in value. Both companies should be around the 50-70usd mark.\n\nMy reasoning is, intel still has a lot of potential to come back. They dominated the CPU market for a reason. The only reason why they let AMD take off, they got lazy. They didn't try to make better products. They just made slight improvements and kept their high pricing. Only focusing on generating more revenue than innovations. They currently had a change in leadership and their current CEO is an engineer. In the 1980's, he helped designed the architecture for the Intel 80486 processor. So he clearly has knowledge in intel's products.\n\nWhile in contrast, when AMD switched their CEO to Lisa Su (who is also an IT engineer) in 2014. We saw the birth of AMD's ryzen series, two years later.\n\nSo it is safe to assume, that Intel will make a come back with their CPUs in the coming years with new leadership.",

        "selftext": "Almost everyone considers P:E when buying stock in a company, but have you considered their [EV/EBITDA](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/072715/what-considered-healthy-evebitda.asp)? One is not necessarily better than the other, but It can be very helpful to consider a companies Enterprise Value.\n\n \n\nIf you were considering buying 2 cars, and they both cost $30k, but one had $2000 cash in the glove compartment, and the other had $2000 in unpaid parking tickets in the glove, that would be important to you, right? If you only look at market cap and not Enterprise Value (EV), you are ignoring what's in the glove compartment.\n\n \n\nConsider 2 companies with a similar market cap, say INTC ($226.7B) and CSCO ($223.4B). If you just look at their market caps, you might say they are close enough (1.5% difference) that you will just directly compare their income statements. But Cisco has $29.4B in cash and only $14.5B in debt, so when you buy their stock, you are also buying some of their cash reserves. This is included in the Enterprise Value (EV) which is $223.4B+$14.5B-$29.4B=$208.5B\n\nIntel has $23.9B cash and $36B debt, so their EV is $226.7B+$36B-$23.9B=$238.8B\n\nSo when you consider their cash and debt, Intel can be considered 14.5% more expensive than Cisco instead of 1.5%.\n\n \n\nIt's not always the be all end all, but it can be very helpful to look at Enterprise Value when you are comparing stocks.",

Mostly all of these are growth or technology related stocks, so far, so good with the majority of them up, except Airbnb and Intel which are 10%-14% down but no heavy impact on the portfolio.\n\nSo now I want to put a part of the portfolio in ETFs that can help me diversify and I\u2019m looking for something like 70% in low risk/fix income ETF and 30% in growth ETF. \n\nI\u2019ve looked into several ETF\u2019s by now but haven\u2019t found a good option so I\u2019m interested in your opinion, suggestions and holdings.",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 19th, 2021.\n\n# **Earnings could be the biggest driver for markets in the week ahead as investors watch bonds - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/16/earnings-could-be-the-biggest-driver-for-markets-in-the-week-ahead-as-investors-watch-bonds.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks enter a busy week for earnings news with two perplexing questions hanging over the market.\n*****\n&gt; One is whether the big gains in corporate profits will start to boost stocks with solid earnings reports. That was not the case for some financial sector stocks this past week. The other question is whether the surprise decline in the 10-year Treasury note yield is sending a message that stock investors should heed.\n*****\n&gt; The benchmark 10-year yield, which moves opposite price, was at 1.30% Friday, after dipping below that level on Thursday. Stock indexes slipped for the week, with the S&amp;P 500 down nearly 1% and the Dow down about 0.5% for the week. The Nasdaq, which has typically benefited from lower yields, was off by more than 1.9% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks had a rocky day Friday, selling off into the closing bell. Defensive sectors, like health care, consumer staples and utilities gained in the session, while cyclicals, like energy and materials were hit hard.\n*****\n&gt; Airlines, railroads, drug companies and tech are among the many industries reporting results in the week ahead. Netflix reports Tuesday, while Johnson &amp; Johnson, Coca-Cola, and Verizon issue results on Wednesday. Intel and AT&amp;T report Thursday. American Express and Honeywell release quarterly earnings Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cEarnings have the spotlight in the coming week,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to see economic data upstage earnings.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Data takes a backseat to earnings\n&gt; Among the handful of economic reports are housing starts Tuesday and existing home sales Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said he is watching earnings report to see if stocks rally or languish after results. He said earnings for the S&amp;P 500 companies are now expected to be up more than 66% for the quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think what it means is investors are looking at this quarter as a peak quarter in the earnings cycle,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting what analysts had expected and then some, but because we are now on the leeward side of the earnings cycle, I think investors are probably going to be taking some profits because their expectations have been met and will not be exceeded in coming quarters.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group, said earnings may be more of a factor for stocks in the much quieter week ahead. In the past week, the market focus was on two days of testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and important data, like the consumer price index and retail sales.\n*****\n&gt; # Bonds are in the spotlight\n&gt; \u201cI think the biggest issue is still going to be the 10-year bond yield,\u201d Paulsen said. He said the key will be whether the 10-year yield falls back to its recent low of 1.25% or breaks above the important 1.4% level.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the continued drop in the bond yield is scaring investors overall \u2014 but particularly equity investors,\u201d said Paulsen. The falling 10-year yield has recently been viewed favorably because lower interest rates are positive for tech and growth stocks. But the yield is now getting attention for continuing to move lower, contrary to the reflation trade and defying forecasts for higher yields.\n*****\n&gt; Bond strategists have been surprised by the decline, which they blame on a variety of factors. One is a massive repositioning by investors who were short the longer duration Treasury issues and were betting on higher yields. Another reason is there is less new issuance than expected from the Treasury.\n*****\n&gt; But there are also troubling worries about the economy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat the heck is it telling us? The fears are it\u2019s giving a better read on Covid and maybe a coming slowdown. Growth is good, while it\u2019s not going to be near as good as people thought,\u201d said Paulsen. One worrisome scenario factoring into the lower yields is that the Fed may be forced to tighten policy sooner than expected because of hot inflation, and that could slow the economy.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said there\u2019s a chance the bond market is sending a warning for stocks, and it is acting as a canary in a coal mine. But he also sees the yield reversing and moving higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOur belief is it will move higher by the end of the year, and economic growth will be strong,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the market will continue to watch that because interest rates are so crucial to intrinsic value models and it\u2019s also doing what most people did not expect it to do.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/FSVz3bA.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/IiKZTvf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/s5IARy6.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/ShIhfh7.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/A0Ilp43.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/IJDcLpV.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/WiW5JV3.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MANr79t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ePKixdd.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jpsa566.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/SF6KKGn.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/QnG52o8.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/2G3oPKn.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Main Street Sentiment Remains Strong Despite Risks from Speedy Recovery\n\n&gt; Sentiment on Main Street remains strong as the U.S. economy continues to move towards normalcy, but concerns about the impact of a strong but uneven recovery are rising as higher prices, supply chain bottlenecks, and trouble finding qualified workers weigh on businesses\u2019 ability to expand.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Main Street sentiment is at its second highest level in over a decade according to LPL Research\u2019s proprietary Beige Book Barometer (BBB), topped only by the June 2021 BBB reading. The result is based on our analysis of the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) Beige Book, a publication released two weeks before each Fed policy meeting that captures qualitative observations made by community bankers and business owners\u2014what we like to think of as \u201cMain Street\u201d rather than \u201cWall Street.\u201d The BBB gauges sentiment by looking at how frequently key words and phrases appear in the text.\n\n&gt; In the most recent Beige Book, \u201cstrong\u201d words had declined slightly while \u201cweak\u201d words fell to their lowest level since the BBB\u2019s inception in 2005. However, expressions of uncertainty had increased and the report did note broad-based pricing pressures. Our sub-index of inflation-related words in the Beige Book remained at its highest level since we created the inflation sub-index in 2015.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe economy is picking up speed but has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWe expect the return to normalcy to continue to support economic growth, but the speed of the recovery also comes with some hazards.\u201d (For more on LPL Research\u2019s economic outlook and its potential impact on markets, see its recently released Midyear Outlook 2021: Picking Up Speed ).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.16.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Mentions of COVID-related words (virus, COVID, pandemic) continued to fall in the most recent Beige Book, as they have in every Beige Book since January, even falling below the level of their initial appearance in March 2020. More concerning, in addition to the persistence of inflation-related words, supply chains also received frequent mention and mentions of shortages remained elevated. The downside of the economy\u2019s rapid acceleration has been a mismatch between demand, which can ramp up quickly, and supply, which comes on line more slowly, while labor markets have also been slow to keep pace with reopening.\n\n&gt; Nevertheless, the fundamental backdrop for the economy remains positive. Upside risks from inflation and disruptions from the Delta COVID variant are on-going risks, but we continue to expect inflation to start to subside as the economy normalizes. Global vaccine distribution will help limit the impact of the Delta variant, although it has led to some new restrictions. US economic acceleration will probably peak in the second quarter, but there\u2019s still plenty of scope for growth to moderate and still remain above average. Much of the positive news is already priced in for equity markets, which are forward looking, and gains may not come as easily, but we still see solid potential for upside as the economy continues to rebound and potentially gains additional support from an improving global economy.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # A Check-In on Inflation\n\n&gt; This week has provided investors with a fresh batch of data carrying the potential to heavily affect the inflation debate. Tuesday brought us the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for June, while Wednesday saw the release of the Producer Price Index (PPI) for June as well as the start of Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s two-day testimony to Congress providing an update on the economy.\n\n&gt; So has any of this materially changed our view (or the Fed\u2019s) on the great inflation debate? Not really.\n\n&gt; This may surprise some given CPI\u2019s and PPI\u2019s large beats relative to expectations, but at least for the next few months we believe that the composition of the inflationary increases is more important than the headline numbers. Headline CPI jumped 0.9% month over month vs. estimates of 0.5%, while core CPI jumped 0.9% month over month vs. estimates of 0.4%. Base effects from rolling off weak numbers a year earlier meant the year-over-year numbers were even more eye-popping. Meanwhile, headline and core PPI both rose 1.0% month over month vs. expectations for 0.5%. Under the hood, though, the theme of both reports is quicker-than-anticipated reopenings are stretching supply chains. The good news there is that those supply chain dynamics have the potential to improve quickly to meet demand and mitigate the lasting effects.\n\n&gt; This is especially true in the auto, travel, hospitality, and food industries. Semiconductor shortages, which are already showing signs of subsiding, are driving shortages in both the new and used car marketplaces. As rental car companies increase their fleets to meet demand, they are increasingly being forced to bid up a limited amount of existing supply. Similarly, labor supply shortages in the leisure and hospitality sector, as well as airline travel, are restricting supply and causing prices to skyrocket. These components all tend to be relatively small parts of the overall CPI basket, but at the moment they are driving an outsized degree of the volatility.\n\n&gt; All of these phenomena can be described as supply chain bottlenecks, which should eventually resolve themselves. For example, the elimination of supplemental unemployment benefits in September should help increase the supply of labor. Rent prices, though, have a greater impact on overall CPI as they account for 41% of the basket, and increases tend to have greater staying power. While they have risen slightly, they are still under control by historical standards, and play a major part in informing our view that inflation will eventually prove to be transitory.\n\n&gt; Fed Chair Powell\u2019s testimony did not break any new ground on the debate either. While the market did perk its ears up when Powell mentioned that the committee is in \u201cactive consideration\u201d over when to begin tapering asset purchases, his characterization of inflation as being mainly transitory and affected by supply chain bottlenecks remained steadfast.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe composition of recent data suggests that inflation will largely prove transitory as the Fed has stated,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cJust how long \u2018transitory\u2019 will prove to be is the big question. We are in the middle of the season when we expected to see some hot prints, so this week has not necessarily been a surprise. But with each passing report market participants will be increasingly anxious to see those numbers start to moderate.\u201d\n\n&gt; What is market pricing telling us about inflation? As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, the market seems to be largely buying into the Fed\u2019s narrative of transitory elevated inflation so far.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.16.21-Blog-2-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Breakeven inflation rates, market-based measures of inflation expectations over given timeframes, rose steadily until roughly the release of the April CPI report when we started hearing about peak inflation concerns. Though that report beat consensus estimates, the subsequent drop in both 5- and 10-year breakevens suggests the market accepted the Fed\u2019s characterization of inflation as transitory.\n\n&gt; And while the levels of these series can be volatile, we believe the divergence that began around the New Year is telling. 5-year breakevens began outpacing 10-year breakevens, suggesting that inflation may run hotter in the near-to-intermediate term, but that the market still has faith in the Fed to keep long-term inflation under control. 5-years making a new local high in the last week without 10-years following suit suggests that while the market is slightly concerned that transitory may prove to be longer than originally thought, it does not believe it will cause concerns on a longer horizon.\n\n&gt; Rents and wages continue to be areas we monitor as tells on whether inflation may be \u201cstickier\u201d than the market anticipates. Our next good look into wage pressure comes on July 30 when we will receive the second quarter Employment Cost Index (ECI) from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This report is important because it keeps the jobs mix it looks at constant. If there is wage pressure it may not show up in average earnings data if the job mix is shifting to lower wage jobs, as we likely have now, but the ECI would capture it.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # S&amp;P 500 Equalweight Lagging Badly\n\n&gt; If you've been following the market over the last couple of months, you've likely noticed that the \"mega-cap\" stocks have been the main driver of the broad market's move higher. You can really see this trend when looking at the performance disparity between the cap-weighted S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and the equal-weight S&amp;P 500 (RSP). (Just to be clear, the main S&amp;P 500 index that's tracked closely across the investment landscape is a cap-weighted index, meaning larger stocks have a bigger impact on its performance than smaller stocks. The lesser-followed equal-weight S&amp;P 500 weights all 500 stocks in the index equally. In the equal-weight S&amp;P 500, Apple (AAPL) -- the largest stock in the index -- and Unum Group (UNM) -- the smallest stock in the index -- have the exact same impact on the index's performance.)\n\n&gt; Yesterday was once again a bad day for most stocks as the equal-weight S&amp;P 500 (RSP) fell more than 0.90% on the day. At the same time, the cap-weighted S&amp;P 500 actually closed slightly higher on the day. As shown below, RSP has been stuck in a sideways pattern for the past two months, essentially going nowhere. SPY, on the other hand, has experienced a nice leg higher and is now very extended above its 50-day moving average. Over the last 12 trading days, SPY has closed at a new high 8 times while RSP has averaged a daily move of -0.02%. While the mega-cap growth stocks spent the time from late 2020 through early 2021 in consolidation, it's not the smaller cap stocks in the index that look to have fallen asleep.

As shown below, RSP is only up 0.33% over the last two months, while SPY is up 4.64%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/rspspy2mth.png))**\n\n&gt; The recent underperformance we've seen from RSP is definitely outside the norm. Below we show the rolling 2-month performance spread between RSP and SPY since RSP began trading in 2003. There have only been two other periods where we've seen the 2-month performance spread turn more negative for the equal-weight S&amp;P versus the cap-weighted S&amp;P. The first was in late October/November 2008 when the entire market was falling rapidly during the Financial Crisis. The second was in late March 2020 during the COVID Crash. These two examples show that we normally see RSP significantly underperform SPY like this when the broad market is falling; not when it's rallying to record highs on a seemingly daily basis.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/2mthspread.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Fewer Bulls Without More Bears\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is flat on the week but the index did tag record highs on Monday. In spite of this, sentiment has turned lower as the AAII survey showed bullish sentiment fall four percentage points to 36.2% this week. That took out the low of 36.4% from the week of May 27th to make for the lowest reading since the last week of October.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/071521-AAII-Bull.png))**\n\n&gt; Some of those declines were picked up by bearish sentiment which rose to 26.8% from 24.5%. Whereas bullish sentiment is at one of the lowest levels in months, that is only the highest level in bearish sentiment since May 13th.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/071521-AAII-Bear.png))**\n\n&gt; With bearish sentiment having risen only slightly while bullish sentiment experiences a more significant decline, the bull-bear spread has fallen to 9.4. That is at the low end of the past several months' range.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/071521-AAII-Bull-Bear.png))**\n\n&gt; Instead, the losses to bullish sentiment have been picked up by the neutral sentiment camp as this week's reading topped 37%. While late May and early June saw similar to slightly higher readings, that level of neutral sentiment is elevated relative to the historical average of 31.43%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/071521-AAII-Neutral.png))**\n\n&gt; Overall, the AAII survey has shown individual investors have become increasingly less optimistic, albeit not outright bearish, over the past few weeks. And while that may be the case for this group, equity newsletter writers have been another story. The sentiment survey from Investors Intelligence (II) covering this section of the market participantshas maintained a more optimistic outlook. This week, 61.2% of respondents reported as bullish which is the highest reading since April. That also comes in the top 5% of all readings since the start of the survey in the early 1960s.\n\n&gt; In the chart below, we show the spread in the bullish sentiment readings of the AAII and Investors Intelligence surveys. This week, that spread fell down to -25 (meaning the percentage of respondents reporting as bullish in the AAII survey is 25 points lower than in the Investors Intelligence survey). That is the lowest reading in the spread since October and it is also in the bottom 5% of all periods.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/071521-AAII-II-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; There have been 20 times in which the spread has dipped below -25 without having done so in the prior six months. As shown, these instances are not particularly rare with about a year or two between each one. But what is notable about the current instance is how elevated the bullish sentiment readings are for each survey. As for what this means for the performance of the S&amp;P 500, in the near term performance has tended to have a negative bias, but moves higher are much more consistently seen in the months to a year after.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/071521-AAII-II-Spread-Table.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending July 16th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 7.18.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.19.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/h3146qZ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.19.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/g9gN2iA.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  7.20.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8hBKbge.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.20.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/YhZCElh.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.21.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Sxu7tNf.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.21.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jPx22l4.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.22.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oEBe8Co.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.22.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/9tMrJQe.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.23.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/qTGKTWP.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.23.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend a great trading week ahead r/stocks. :)",

The company is initially focusing on forearm casts as that is the location where highest breaks and fractures occur. Once placed, a button on the cast is pushed and the material surrounding the arm solidifies and cures within 4 minutes. In comparison the normal cure time for traditional casts are 45min-hour and require a casting technician to implement. The casts are Hygieia protected, contain an internal battery using the powercell tech, and the cast is waterproof allowing for showering and swimming.

UATG has a percentage equity interest in these companies.\n\n\n                                      **THOUGHTS**\n\nI wanted to share this information with this community as I\u2019m pretty excited about the future outlook and I think this company just has some really neat technology stuff they work on. The CEO Alex Umbra has been incredibly transparent and informative, creating video series for youtube as well as releasing consistent Friday updates and Q&amp;A segments. I tried my best to include information as an introduction, there\u2019s actually a lot of info out there mostly via youtube, twitter, and their websites but unfortunately i\u2019ve found the spread of info lacking on forums like IHUB. During the weeks of June the stock had been trading sideways between .028-.031 per share after coming down from a new high of .05 at the end of May. At the end of June/beginning of July the stock tanked even further hovering around the .02 per share area. I think this is due to a lack of volume as well as being in a waiting period for news etc but with attention I think this stock could easily return to its high and beyond especially with reporting of revenues as well as some of the catalysts (H2O processing contracts, Bacter Scientific Covid device, products slated for the end of 2021) at play.\u00a0 Volume recently has been a concern as it has been incredibly low and much lower than the 10day average.The financials of all of the subsidiaries will be included as of Q2 which is on the horizon and I'm excited to see the growth!",

        "selftext": "#### From Stansberry Research\n\n#### \n\n#### A Three-Pronged Strategy for Accelerated Growth\n\n**inTEST (NYSE American: INTT)** is a global supplier of precision-engineered equipment used to test and manufacture everything from medical devices to cell phones to aircraft.\n\nThe business has two segments: thermal products and electromechanical semiconductor (\"EMS\") products.\n\nThe thermal segment designs and sells equipment used for manufacturing activities, like forming metals with precise heating and or managing extreme temperatures. This equipment is widely used across the automotive, defense, aerospace, energy, industrial, medical, semiconductor, and telecommunications sectors. Now, it's also being used in the fast-growing cannabis industry. (More on that in a minute.)\n\nThe EMS segment designs and sells products used primarily by semiconductor companies to automatically test the chips they manufacture for defects. (Automated test equipment is referred to as \"ATE.\") In addition to selling directly to big, well-known chip manufacturers like Texas Instruments (TXN), inTEST also sells to third-party testing services and ATE original equipment manufacturers (\"OEMs\") like market leader Teradyne (TER).\n\nIn 2019, inTEST began referring to all the products it sells to semiconductor customers as the \"semi market.\" Everything else \u2013 basically, all non-semi, thermal product sales \u2013 are referred to as \"multimarket.\"\n\nIts largest customers include Analog Devices (ADI), Emerson Electric (EMR), Lockheed Martin (LMT), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Texas Instruments, among others.\n\nLast year, inTEST's board of directors decided it was time for the company to renew its focus on growth. So they hired Richard Grant as CEO. Grant is an outsider who brings many years of executive experience from stints with three global, publicly traded industrial companies: ABB (ABB), former *Extreme Value* winner Ametek (AME), and Emerson Electric.\n\nThe board gave Grant a mandate to drive new and more sustainable long-term growth for inTEST. And last March, he outlined his plan to transform the company, potentially doubling revenue in the process.\n\nUnder Grant's leadership, inTEST will now focus on three strategies to accelerate growth...\n\n**Growth Strategy No. 1: Expand inTEST's Global Footprint**\n\ninTEST provides products and services to customers around the globe, but its manufacturing plants are located entirely in the U.S. Grant says this makes it difficult to succeed in foreign markets, particularly when facing local competitors.\n\nHaving a presence in international markets provides access to lower-cost labor, lower shipping costs, and an improved ability to compete on price. So Grant is determined to expand inTEST's manufacturing footprint. Last month, he announced inTEST's Ambrell business will establish a presence in Mexico for the first time.\n\nAmbrell is part of inTEST's thermal segment. It makes the induction (i.e. precision) heating systems manufacturers rely on to build electric motors. Since a large percentage of electric motors are already manufactured in Mexico, Grant says it makes sense to have a presence there. And General Motors' (GM) recent announcement that it will invest $1 billion to produce electric vehicles (\"EVs\") in the country means the timing couldn't be better.\n\nFirst steps include the addition of a full-time sales representative, an applications engineer dedicated to working with Latin America-based customers, and plans to build an applications lab in Mexico. It's also possible inTEST could acquire another company with a significant footprint in Mexico over the next 12 months to further its presence there.\n\n**Growth Strategy No. 2: Develop New Solutions for New Users**\n\nGrant says inTEST will also grow by developing solutions that are \"new to the company, new to the industry, or new to the world.\" A primary focus of its multimarket segment will be two of the hottest emerging markets in the world right now: EVs and cannabis.\n\nLast month, we recommended [**CTS (NYSE: CTS)**](https://members.stansberryresearch.com/articles/ride-the-ev-wave-with-this-little-known-125-year-old-company) as an excellent way to play the **emerging EV wave**. inTEST gives us good exposure to EVs as well.\n\nCurrently, the EV market is small. Last year, about 2.5 million EVs sold, accounting for just 4% of worldwide auto sales. But consumers are getting more and more comfortable with EVs. And their options are drastically improving, with more than 400 different models expected to launch by 2025. So sales growth is expected to rise rapidly over the next couple decades.\n\nEstimates vary, but a reasonable forecast is that over the next 30 years, the global EV fleet could potentially rise from 10 million units today to 700 million units in 2050. And a lot of them will be manufactured by current EV market leader \u2013 and inTEST customer \u2013 Tesla (TSLA).\n\nTo meet its share of this future demand, Tesla is currently building its fourth EV-manufacturing plant, this one in Berlin. Production is expected to eventually hit 500,000 cars per year. That's more EVs than all other German carmakers *combined* produced in 2020.\n\nBig new Tesla factories are great news for inTEST. The company started working with Tesla early, creating custom thermal solutions for its production of motors, steering columns, and other applications. As Tesla continues to ramp global production (its stated goal is 50% growth per year), it'll need more inTEST equipment.\n\nNow, Grant says inTEST is also leveraging its Tesla expertise to capture opportunities with other EV manufacturers. During the first-quarter 2021 call with analysts in May, he noted that inTEST is receiving \"robust\" orders from other EV makers.\n\nOn the third-quarter 2020 call last November, he highlighted EV orders from a \"large domestic automotive manufacturer\" and the company's first order from an EV truck start-up. Later this year, INTT will also launch a marketing campaign targeted at 300 EV contacts to increase awareness.\n\nThe second emerging market that holds great promise for inTEST is **cannabis**.\n\nTo get a sense for just how promising this market is, here's what cannabis expert Tom Carroll recently told subscribers to his *Cannabis Capitalist* newsletter...\n\n&gt;Overall, the legal cannabis market in the U.S. is still in the early stages... But it has grown immensely in the last five years.  \nThis is a massive, newly legal market \u2013 likely the biggest in a generation.  \nIn 2014, the legal and recreational market totaled about $2 billion. By 2020, total sales grew to $18 billion... a monumental increase. However, by 2025, the market is expected to more than double from 2020, exceeding $40 billion.\n\nKeep in mind, these numbers are just for the U.S. Grandview Research estimates the global cannabis cultivation market was $124 billion in 2019 and will exceed $300 billion by 2027.\n\nThe concentrates segment \u2013 oils extracted from cannabis plants \u2013 is the fastest-growing part of this market. Extracting cannabinoid-containing oil from the rest of the plant requires extreme temperatures that must be precisely controlled throughout the entire process. That just happens to be an area where inTEST shines...\n\ninTEST honed its skills in the thermal-equipment sector by building demanding, customized applications for military, aerospace, and energy customers. Now, it's leveraging that skill set to deliver the highest-quality and fastest extraction times available in the botanical-extraction industry.\n\nFor example, inTEST uses liquid nitrogen chillers that can cool 100 gallons of ethanol (the extraction agent) to an extreme -70\u00b0C in less than 30 minutes. During the third-quarter call, Grant told analysts that chiller bookings and revenues each exceeded $1 million in a quarter for the first time in history.\n\nOn the May call with analysts, Grant said the initiative launched last year to target OEMs in the cannabis space is also bearing fruit. One new OEM has placed a $300,000 order. An existing OEM customer has placed a follow-up order. And inTEST has signed two brand-new OEM customers.\n\ninTEST has also launched a marketing campaign targeted at 800 potential customers across the cannabis industry.\n\n**Growth Strategy No. 3: Grow Through Strategic Acquisitions**\n\ninTEST has only made two acquisitions in the past decade, the last one in 2017. Grant has made it clear that will change on his watch.\n\nDuring the fourth-quarter 2020 call in February, he told analysts that inTEST will aggressively drive merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activities moving forward. This includes targeting...\n\n1. \"Bolt on\" deals \u2013 smaller companies in the same line of work as inTEST that expand existing product lines or geographic coverage areas.\n2. Companies that broaden the reach of inTEST's process technology capabilities in areas like medical-device manufacturing or material testing.\n3. Businesses that bring in entirely new customers, such as environmental testing.\n\nEssentially, nothing is off the table here.\n\nAcquisitions for a smaller company like inTEST can dramatically boost investment returns. This was an important attribute of our TFI International recommendation, and it has paid off. As of yesterday's close, we're up 146% on TFII. inTEST has the same kind of potential under Grant's leadership.\n\n#### The Next Cyclical Upturn in Semiconductors Means More Growth for INTT\n\ninTEST's three-pronged growth strategy is largely focused on opportunities in its multimarket segment. But there's a solid growth story underlying the EMS business, too...\n\nThe proliferation of chips in everything from cars to consumer electronics to factories is the driving force behind rising semiconductor demand. This in turn creates demand for the ATE products that inTEST manufactures and sells. Basically, anytime chip manufacturers expand their capacity to meet rising demand, it's good for inTEST's EMS business.\n\nIn its latest annual 10-K filing with the SEC, inTEST says the semiconductor market entered a cyclical downturn in early 2019. But the company now believes the next cyclical upturn has begun\u2026\n\nOn a trailing 12-month basis, inTEST's booking growth rate (semiconductor-related orders placed but not yet executed) confirms this. After turning negative in the first quarter of 2019 (-3%), it didn't return to positive territory until the fourth quarter of 2020 (27%). The booking growth rate for the first quarter of 2021 was even higher (62%).\n\nDue in part to the chip shortage we reported on [last month](https://members.stansberryresearch.com/articles/ride-the-ev-wave-with-this-little-known-125-year-old-company), inTEST customers are in, according to Grant, a \"race to add capacity,\" particularly for the semiconductors used in automobiles and mobile phones.\n\nTexas Instruments is currently building its latest semiconductor foundry (or manufacturing plant) in Texas. Intel (INTC), another inTEST customer, announced a $20 billion investment back in March to expand its chipmaking footprint in Arizona. And Intel's chief rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) \u2013 which accounts for 15% of TER's business and therefore indirectly affects inTEST \u2013 just broke ground on a new Arizona foundry that it says could be the first of six on this site over the next 10 to 15 years.\n\nEarlier this week, the U.S. Senate also passed the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act. If enacted, the legislation commits approximately $50 billion to boosting domestic semiconductor production. The effort to wean America off foreign-made chips has bipartisan support and could become an important new source of growth for inTEST.\n\nThere are other interesting opportunities that could add incremental growth from here, too. For instance, following a long development period, EMS has begun receiving orders from a \"major player in the memory test space.\" And its intelligent test cell system could be a big winner as customers (new and existing) upgrade their older test systems.\n\nNo one, including us, knows how long this new semiconductor cycle upturn, now two quarters long, will last. But with orders on the rise and the recent addition of EMS Vice President and General Manager Joe McManus, inTEST is primed to capitalize on the trend for as long as possible.\n\nGrant hired McManus to run this highly technical business segment largely because of his growth track record. During his seven-year tenure as a sales executive at a small semiconductor business, for instance, McManus reportedly helped grow sales from less than $20 million to more than $65 million.\n\nHis appointment at inTEST appears to be well-timed for the nascent semiconductor cycle upturn.\n\nIn short, inTEST has multiple avenues of growth that are likely to play out over the next few years. Now, let's take a look at the Five Clues...\n\n#### The Five Essential Financial Clues\n\nWe use the [Five Essential Financial Clues](https://members.stansberryresearch.com/articles/financial-clue-video) to help us identify great businesses. A great business doesn't necessarily have all five clues present. But the best ones tend to have more of them than less well-run companies. It would be normal for such a young technology company to not have a single one of the five clues present. But as you'll see, INTT stacks up fairly well, with especially strong performance in free cash flow (\"FCF\") and its balance sheet.\n\n**Gushes Free Cash Flow**\n\nA business's intrinsic value comes from the cash it generates in excess of all taxes, expenses, and reinvesting enough to maintain and grow. That's called FCF. The best businesses tend to generate more cash than they know what to do with.\n\nLike many technology-based businesses today, INTT has a history of generating consistent FCF. (The big drop in 2019 is due to an \"earnout\" payment related to the 2017 acquisition of Ambrell.) Increased capital spending to facilitate new growth \u2013 including investments in newly acquired businesses \u2013 could reduce FCF in the next few years... but we'd consider this simply laying the foundation for larger FCF over the long term.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n**Consistent Margins**\n\nIn a capitalist economy, it's normal for competition to winnow profit margins, sometimes down to zero, as companies compete more and more aggressively for market share. A consistent margin is an economic anomaly, sometimes indicating that a business provides goods and service its customers can't get elsewhere.\n\nINTT has a history of consistent (and relatively high) gross margins, a reflection of the fact that its solutions are often highly configured to match unique customer needs and command premium pricing.\n\nHowever, operating, pretax, and net margins are much more susceptible to the boom-and-bust nature of the semiconductor cycle. That's because many of the high fixed costs associated with manufacturing chip equipment (like operating and maintaining the plants) don't go away when sales decline.\n\nAs we noted earlier, the chip cycle turned down in 2019, causing these margins to decline. The good news is the decline is over, and the cycle is turning up. This is when you want to buy cyclical companies.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nWe expect margins to rebound as the post-pandemic recovery gains steam and key markets like cannabis and EVs continue to grow rapidly.\n\n**Strong Balance Sheet**\n\nThere are two kinds of good balance sheets. The first is when a company has more cash than debt. The second is when a company has more debt than cash on hand but earns enough income to cover its debt service obligations.\n\nINTT is the first kind. It has $10.2 million in cash and no debt. This is an ideal setup for financing new acquisitions, allowing plenty of room to borrow for those acquisitions. That is important because it won't need to fundraise by issuing new shares (a move that dilutes current shareholders).\n\nA cash-gushing business with a pristine, debt-free balance sheet is a rare find these days. We believe INTT is ready to make good use of it.\n\n**Shareholder Rewards**\n\nINTT doesn't pay a dividend and management says it doesn't expect to do so \"in the foreseeable future.\" That's not unusual for a small, young company. It simply reflects the fact that INTT is instead plowing its excess cash flows back into the business... for acquisitions or to buy back stock.\n\nMost companies are mediocre share repurchasers, and we haven't seen anything that tells us INTT will do any better. The best we can expect is for this activity to do no harm.\n\nOver time, we've learned one of the benefits of shareholder rewards is that they impose discipline on the management team by limiting the amount of capital available. No company can reinvest unlimited amounts of capital, and capital allocators are only human. A large amount of excess cash on the balance sheet tends to burn a hole in management's pockets. Share repurchases help to prevent the company from spending wastefully.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n**Consistent Return on Equity**\n\nIf a business were a bank account, return on equity (\"ROE\") would be the interest rate you'd earn on all the money you left in it.\n\nCyclical companies like inTEST normally experience fluctuating ROE over a full cycle.\n\nAs you can see in the following chart, the strong bounce out of the 2009 chip-cycle low resulted in extraordinary ROE in 2010 and 2011 (higher than 40%). As the cycle matured, ROE fluctuated between 5% and 10% before dipping into negative territory during the latest cycle downturn.\n\nWith the semiconductor cycle once again turning up, inTEST's ROE is also on the rise. As of the first-quarter 2021, it was 5.4% and already above the five-year average of 4.3%. We expect it to move even higher in the quarters ahead.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n#### What's It Worth?\n\nNow let's put our Price Implied Expectations model to work in order to get a handle on INTT's upside potential at its recent share price. We'll start as we typically do with a review of our model's three most important inputs: revenue growth, operating margins, and FCF margins.\n\n**Revenue Growth Expectations**\n\nDespite the strong bounce in INTT's stock over the past year, the current share price implies just 3% average growth beyond 2021. That's too low.\n\nRemember, the semiconductor cycle has just turned up. That means inTEST's EMS revenue will likely ramp higher as chipmakers expand capacity to satisfy growing demand. And these upturns can last years.\n\nThe company's thermal business is also poised to grow sharply as the markets for EVs and cannabis expand.\n\nFactSet reports that the consensus of analysts who cover inTEST is that revenue over the next 12 months (Year 1 of our analysis) will be $80 million. The company doesn't provide a next-12-months revenue forecast. But for the current quarter, it expects to generate between $20 million and $21 million. On an annualized basis, the low end of that range lines up with FactSet's estimate ($20 million x 4 quarters = $80 million). That's a good starting point for Year 1 revenue.\n\nThe FactSet consensus for Year 2 of our analysis translates to 10% revenue growth. That's consistent with the 10% average growth rate inTEST experienced between the last two major chip cycle lows in 2009 and 2019.\n\nBut there are two big differences between the inTEST of today and the inTEST of a few years ago...\n\nIn 2021, the multimarket segment (the one targeting cannabis and EVs) accounted for 46% of total new company orders. In 2015, it accounted for just 28%. This provides much-needed revenue stability compared with the cyclical semiconductor business.\n\nWhen the chip cycle turned down in 2019, inTEST's semiconductor orders declined as much as 45% YOY (on a TTM basis) during the fourth quarter. But multimarket revenue only fell 15% in the same period. Ultimately, this factor alone will help INTT post better-than-10% average revenue growth in the years ahead.\n\nThe second big difference between the inTEST of today and the inTEST of a few years ago relates to acquisitions. Acquisitions only made a limited contribution to the 10% average revenue growth between 2009 and 2019. But as we mentioned earlier, Grant intends to increase M&amp;A activity. We think an incremental average growth of 1% to 2% from acquisitions is reasonable.\n\nIn the final analysis, we expect inTEST's revenue to grow 13% on average over the next five years.\n\n**Operating Margins**\n\nOver the last complete semiconductor cycle (from the low in 2009 to the low in 2019), inTEST's operating margins averaged 8.9%.\n\nLooking ahead, we expect inTEST's average, full-cycle operating margin \u2013 the average margin earned from one cycle low to the next \u2013 to move considerably higher for four reasons...\n\nFirst, diversification away from the chip cycle will reduce the depth of the operating margin decline. During the latest 2019 to 2020 downturn, the operating margin bottomed at -0.3%. That's far better than what happened in 2009 (-18.7%). The difference is primarily related to growth of the multimarket business and greater diversification away from the deeply cyclical semiconductor sector.\n\nSecond, shortly after taking the helm, Grant took steps to consolidate EMS' manufacturing facilities. CFO Hugh T. Regan, Jr. estimates this will result in annual cost savings of $600,000.\n\nAt the same time, EMS sales are rising. Grant says shipments of certain EMS products over the first half of this year are likely to exceed totals for 2019 and 2020 combined. Remember, margins can move sharply higher when sales are strongly rising and fixed costs are declining.\n\nThird, inTEST already has the manufacturing capacity needed to respond to big organic growth opportunities like EVs and cannabis. This means we'll likely see a significant lift to the consolidated operating margin as sales grow faster than fixed costs company-wide.\n\nFourth, Grant is determined to standardize as much of inTEST's manufacturing as possible and considers this a key to expanding margins. The basic idea here is to increase the use of common components across multiple products, which can be bought in larger quantities at lower prices.\n\nIn summary, we expect INTT's operating margin to average 15% in the current cycle \u2013 widely beating the 8.9% from the previous full cycle. Our Year 1 margin forecast is 13.5%, rising gradually to 15% by Year 3.\n\n**Free Cash Flow Margins**\n\ninTEST's full-cycle average FCF margin was 6.1% (2009 to 2019). The factors expected to boost future operating margins should do the same for FCF margins. But the overall impact will likely be somewhat less, given the capital intensity of the business. (As a manufacturer, inTEST must continuously replace and upgrade its stock of capital equipment.)\n\nOver the past 12 months, the FCF margin was 5.4%. We expect it to rise to 7% over the next 12 months (Year 1) and reach a new full-cycle average of 9% by Year 3.\n\n#### Putting It All Together\n\nRunning the numbers just detailed through our valuation model generates an intrinsic value estimate of $26.50 per share. Think of this as the highest price a knowledgeable buyer would pay for the entire business today.\n\nTo test its reasonableness, we look to recent transactions involving similar businesses.\n\nWe usually make comparisons among companies with stabilized or normal levels of EBITDA. But because inTEST's TTM EBITDA ($7 million) is depressed, it's more appropriate to focus on forward estimates of EBITDA.\n\nThe FactSet consensus for the next 12 months of EBITDA is $12 million, which we consider reasonable. This produces an intrinsic value multiple of 23.5 times.\n\nThe best direct comparable is Wise Road Capital's recent deal to acquire Magnachip Semiconductor (MX) for $29 per share. Like INTT, MX is a highly cyclical small-cap company operating in the chip sector. Its TTM EBITDA ($42.5 million) is also coming off a deep cyclical low and is expected to move sharply higher over the next 12 months to $64.5 million. Using the latter figure produces an enterprise value (\"EV\") to EBITDA multiple of 17.3 times.\n\nIt makes sense that INTT commands a higher multiple than MX. Due to the custom nature of its business, inTEST's products command premium pricing, which translates into much higher gross margins, which then translates into higher operating and FCF margins. Historically, inTEST has likewise experienced faster top-line growth across the full cycle.\n\nOver a five-year period, we estimate inTEST's average EBITDA to be $19.4 million. Using this as a proxy for stabilized next-12-months EBITDA produces a multiple of 14.5 times.\n\nNow, let's compare this with Analog Devices' pending purchase of Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM), another semiconductor deal which just received full approval from EU regulators and should close soon. The deal's multiple based on the next 12 months of EBITDA is 24 times.\n\nIt makes sense that MXIM commands a higher multiple than inTEST. While MXIM has historically grown revenue at a slower rate, it earns much higher gross, operating, and FCF margins.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nOur intrinsic value estimate of $26.50 is well supported by the available market data.",

The name comes from a contraction of \u201c*Int*egrated *El*ectronics\u201d. The company was the first to develop S/DRAM memory chips, and these represented most of its business in the early years.\n\nThrough the 1990s, the company invested heavily in microprocessor design and helped to drive the rapid growth of the personal computer industry. Regrettably, for punters late to the party in \u201899/\u201900, investors had already bid the stock price up exponentially in the tech bubble. These late punters paid the price during the ensuing collapse and period of price stagnation.\n\n[Investors bid up Intel\u2019s shares and then wiped them out through the tech bubble.](https://preview.redd.it/66r7f5qrtz871.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb710bafa09c681775b055a52b2b60636ab22eee)\n\nAfter the tech bubble collapsed, growth in demand for microprocessors began to slow, and Intel\u2019s competitors (most notably AMD) began to etch away at their previously dominant market share. An attempt by then CEO Craig Barrett to diversify the company\u2019s business beyond semiconductors fell flat, and revenues stagnated for a few years.\n\n[Over the long term, Intel has continued to grow.

Over the following 15 years, successful iterative improvements of the company\u2019s technology and the continued rapid growth of Apple helped Intel grow.\n\nIntel is a mature company with a dominant position, long-term stable margins, and slow structural growth.\n\n[Long-term stable margins and slow structural growth.](https://preview.redd.it/l7t8cl9vtz871.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ef39f7f904d41d5b2eaf83571bb2ce761ccc6a4)\n\n\\--\n\n#### The Story\n\n*This mature semiconductor business has lost the Apple contract. After a substantial short-term hit, they will continue growing slowly and steadily, while their leading position and manufacturing capabilities will help them defend margins.*\n\n**Growth:** Intel has had an average CAGR of 5.7% since the mid-2000s. This growth has been broadly in line with market growth over this time and shouldn\u2019t be a surprise given Intel\u2019s dominant position, size and success of Apple products.\n\nHowever, looking forward, given that Apple announced it is transitioning away from Intel processors to in-house ones, we think this will deliver an immediate hit to revenues. Analyst consensus is for an FY21 loss of revenue of 6.7%, and we believe this is about right.\n\nFurther, economists estimate that the global client computing market and cloud data centre markets will grow at 0.1% and 19.0% CAGR, respectively, over the medium term. Based on Intel\u2019s segment weightings, this suggests ongoing medium-term market growth of 5.8%. Given the loss of the Apple contract and the fact that Intel has fallen behind on manufacturing, we think that medium-term growth is likely to be closer to the company\u2019s fundamental growth rate of 2.45%.\n\n**Margins:** Intel has had an average R&amp;D adjusted operating margin of 28.68% over the last ten years. This margin is far above the industry (weighted by segment) average of 14.62% over that time. Over the TTM, the company\u2019s margin was 29.91%.\n\nIntel\u2019s leading position in the microprocessor has helped them scale up and defend margins. The enormous R&amp;D and capital investment required to extend manufacturing processes and capacity for new products act as a consistent call on capital. They have helped act as significant barriers to entry. Intel is now one of a handful of remaining semiconductor companies with the capacity to manufacture chips internally.\n\nGiven this position, we expect Intel to maintain its current average margins by either pushing higher costs through to customers or improving manufacturing processes.\n\n**Net Reinvestment:** We expect Intel to remain an extremely capital intensive business (generating $0.61 of revenue per dollar of invested capital), especially compared to the industry ($1.71 of revenue per dollar of invested capital). Moreover, we expect their extraordinary R&amp;D requirements, which have averaged $13.5B p.a. over the last five years, will not diminish.\n\n**FCF:** But, given how profitable the business is, we expect it to remain highly FCF generative.\n\n**Cost of Capital:** Intel is a semiconductor and electronics business (66.2%) and a cloud services business (33.8%) serving China (26%), Singapore (22.9%), the United States (21.3%), Taiwan (14.9%) and other international markets (14.9%).\n\nThe company has a 0.2x average operating leverage ratio and a 15.7% D/E ratio. Moody\u2019s has assigned Intel an A1 credit rating, which is the same as our long-term synthetic rating but lower than our short-term rating of Aaa. We\u2019ve gone with the former because we agree with Moody\u2019s reasoning:\n\n&gt;\u201cDespite Intel's strong credit metrics, the rating is constrained by the relatively high operating and technology risk associated with leading-edge semiconductor design and manufacturing, and the volatility inherent to the semiconductor sector.\u201d  \n\u2014 Moody\u2019s Investors Services, 21 Sep 2020\n\nMoreover, the A1 rating drives the low (1.08%) chance of distress.\n\n**Other Assets &amp; Minority Claims:** Intel has $17M worth (at book) of investments carried under the equity method, $6.8B of investments held at fair value, and no minority claims outstanding.\n\n**Debts &amp; Other Claims:** Finally, the company owes $35.6B NPV in debts and leases.\n\n\\--\n\n#### The Valuation\n\nThe company reports in USD.

        "selftext": "$NLST IS QUITE LITERALLY GOING TO TAKEOFF! \n\nFor those of you who are unaware, $NLST has been going at it with google for over 10 years now. They have filed multiple lawsuits against google for theft of their 912 seminal patent. \n\nA seminal patent differs from a regular patent because the technology is deemed to be \"AN INVENTION SO IMPACTFUL THAT IT CRESTES OR SHIFTS THE TECHNOLOGY SPACE\". Netlists' technology essentially allows computers to access 4\u00d7 more ram then it normaly would - the reason why google searches are so fast and has continued to stay a top the industry. \n\nThink of it like this \"Google - Powered by netlist.\" \n\nSo after years of appealing google has finally decided not to appeal, essentially agreeing to a settlement. Netlist CEO has already previously stated that he is seeking billions from google, so in essence, if google is agreeing to settle, then google is willing to pay billions. Intel had to payout over 2 billion earlier this year for a non seminal patent, so picture what netlist might get. \n\nNLST currently has a market cap of 1.5B, so imagine what a settlement in the BILLIONS would do for it. \n\nIt also recently was awarded $40 million from sk hynix, one of the biggest producers of semiconductors behind samsung as well as a supply sales agreement and will recieve royalties. \n\nThey are also currently suing samsung for breach of contract. \n\nTheir earnings are august 9th and theyre expected 0.16 per share as oppose to -0.01 the previous quarter. \n\nOn top of everything they actually have really good technology. \n\nThe google settlement is expected to be reached on september 17th. \n\n\n\n I LIKE THE STOCK. \n\nRead the articles for more info! \n\nhttps://see kingalpha.com/instablog/52496833-agni-research/5562387-netlist-high-stakes-patent-litigation \n\nhttps://blocksandfiles.com/2021/04/07/netlist-sk-hynix-in-patent-cross-licensing-deal/ \n\nhttps://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4176760/netlist-inc-v-google-inc/?filed_after=&amp;filed_before=&amp;entry_gte=&amp;entry_lte=&amp;order_by=desc\n\n\nhttp://googlecheatednetlist.com/\n\n\nTLDR; These guys bout to sue the tits off google and go to the moon + They have good shit",

They have a wide diversity of product applications across many industries. Industries include consumer electronics, health and wellness, aerospace automotive, and clean energy. META has changed the manufacturing process of chips. If NanoWeb can be used with any metal, including silicon, then imagine how much you can save on semiconductor chips. Instead of making full silicon discs, companies could use a plastic wafer and print the NanoWeb onto it. META's NanoWeb and holoOPTIC technology is unparalleled to the current competition. Their technology can be produced faster and cheaper than competitors. Their technology is way beyond our current imagination. \n\n\tThe semiconductor chip shortage is a sign. Chips are going to be as essential to our everyday lives as water. The shortage showed the U.S that they are behind the curve. The U.S wants to be in the position to not only supply themselves with chips but also export them to other countries. Biden's $50B plan will play a strategic role in controlling chip supply. META will also seek to capitalize on the semiconductor chip boom. The RML tech will change semiconductor chip manufacturing. This is a great long-term investment. Potentially one of the best silicon stocks to buy. Also, check out the \\[META homepage\\](https://metamaterial.com/). The video up on their homepage goes hard. \n\nFor more information on META, check out their investor deck \\[here.\\](https://metamaterial.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/META-Investor-Deck-FINAL-JULY-2020-4.pdf)\n\n*Disclaimer: This is not investment advice.

Stock indexes slipped for the week, with the S&amp;P 500 down nearly 1% and the Dow down about 0.5% for the week. The Nasdaq, which has typically benefited from lower yields, was off by more than 1.9% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks had a rocky day Friday, selling off into the closing bell. Defensive sectors, like health care, consumer staples and utilities gained in the session, while cyclicals, like energy and materials were hit hard.\n*****\n&gt; Airlines, railroads, drug companies and tech are among the many industries reporting results in the week ahead. Netflix reports Tuesday, while Johnson &amp; Johnson, Coca-Cola, and Verizon issue results on Wednesday. Intel and AT&amp;T report Thursday. American Express and Honeywell release quarterly earnings Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cEarnings have the spotlight in the coming week,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to see economic data upstage earnings.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Data takes a backseat to earnings\n&gt; Among the handful of economic reports are housing starts Tuesday and existing home sales Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said he is watching earnings report to see if stocks rally or languish after results. He said earnings for the S&amp;P 500 companies are now expected to be up more than 66% for the quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think what it means is investors are looking at this quarter as a peak quarter in the earnings cycle,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting what analysts had expected and then some, but because we are now on the leeward side of the earnings cycle, I think investors are probably going to be taking some profits because their expectations have been met and will not be exceeded in coming quarters.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group, said earnings may be more of a factor for stocks in the much quieter week ahead. In the past week, the market focus was on two days of testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and important data, like the consumer price index and retail sales.\n*****\n&gt; # Bonds are in the spotlight\n&gt; \u201cI think the biggest issue is still going to be the 10-year bond yield,\u201d Paulsen said. He said the key will be whether the 10-year yield falls back to its recent low of 1.25% or breaks above the important 1.4% level.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the continued drop in the bond yield is scaring investors overall \u2014 but particularly equity investors,\u201d said Paulsen. The falling 10-year yield has recently been viewed favorably because lower interest rates are positive for tech and growth stocks. But the yield is now getting attention for continuing to move lower, contrary to the reflation trade and defying forecasts for higher yields.\n*****\n&gt; Bond strategists have been surprised by the decline, which they blame on a variety of factors. One is a massive repositioning by investors who were short the longer duration Treasury issues and were betting on higher yields. Another reason is there is less new issuance than expected from the Treasury.\n*****\n&gt; But there are also troubling worries about the economy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat the heck is it telling us? The fears are it\u2019s giving a better read on Covid and maybe a coming slowdown. Growth is good, while it\u2019s not going to be near as good as people thought,\u201d said Paulsen. One worrisome scenario factoring into the lower yields is that the Fed may be forced to tighten policy sooner than expected because of hot inflation, and that could slow the economy.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said there\u2019s a chance the bond market is sending a warning for stocks, and it is acting as a canary in a coal mine. But he also sees the yield reversing and moving higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOur belief is it will move higher by the end of the year, and economic growth will be strong,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the market will continue to watch that because interest rates are so crucial to intrinsic value models and it\u2019s also doing what most people did not expect it to do.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/FSVz3bA.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/IiKZTvf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/s5IARy6.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/ShIhfh7.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/A0Ilp43.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/IJDcLpV.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/WiW5JV3.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MANr79t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ePKixdd.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jpsa566.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/SF6KKGn.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/QnG52o8.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/2G3oPKn.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Main Street Sentiment Remains Strong Despite Risks from Speedy Recovery\n\n&gt; Sentiment on Main Street remains strong as the U.S. economy continues to move towards normalcy, but concerns about the impact of a strong but uneven recovery are rising as higher prices, supply chain bottlenecks, and trouble finding qualified workers weigh on businesses\u2019 ability to expand.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Main Street sentiment is at its second highest level in over a decade according to LPL Research\u2019s proprietary Beige Book Barometer (BBB), topped only by the June 2021 BBB reading. The result is based on our analysis of the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) Beige Book, a publication released two weeks before each Fed policy meeting that captures qualitative observations made by community bankers and business owners\u2014what we like to think of as \u201cMain Street\u201d rather than \u201cWall Street.\u201d The BBB gauges sentiment by looking at how frequently key words and phrases appear in the text.\n\n&gt; In the most recent Beige Book, \u201cstrong\u201d words had declined slightly while \u201cweak\u201d words fell to their lowest level since the BBB\u2019s inception in 2005. However, expressions of uncertainty had increased and the report did note broad-based pricing pressures. Our sub-index of inflation-related words in the Beige Book remained at its highest level since we created the inflation sub-index in 2015.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe economy is picking up speed but has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWe expect the return to normalcy to continue to support economic growth, but the speed of the recovery also comes with some hazards.\u201d (For more on LPL Research\u2019s economic outlook and its potential impact on markets, see its recently released Midyear Outlook 2021: Picking Up Speed ).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.16.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Mentions of COVID-related words (virus, COVID, pandemic) continued to fall in the most recent Beige Book, as they have in every Beige Book since January, even falling below the level of their initial appearance in March 2020. More concerning, in addition to the persistence of inflation-related words, supply chains also received frequent mention and mentions of shortages remained elevated. The downside of the economy\u2019s rapid acceleration has been a mismatch between demand, which can ramp up quickly, and supply, which comes on line more slowly, while labor markets have also been slow to keep pace with reopening.\n\n&gt; Nevertheless, the fundamental backdrop for the economy remains positive. Upside risks from inflation and disruptions from the Delta COVID variant are on-going risks, but we continue to expect inflation to start to subside as the economy normalizes. Global vaccine distribution will help limit the impact of the Delta variant, although it has led to some new restrictions. US economic acceleration will probably peak in the second quarter, but there\u2019s still plenty of scope for growth to moderate and still remain above average. Much of the positive news is already priced in for equity markets, which are forward looking, and gains may not come as easily, but we still see solid potential for upside as the economy continues to rebound and potentially gains additional support from an improving global economy.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # A Check-In on Inflation\n\n&gt; This week has provided investors with a fresh batch of data carrying the potential to heavily affect the inflation debate. Tuesday brought us the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for June, while Wednesday saw the release of the Producer Price Index (PPI) for June as well as the start of Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s two-day testimony to Congress providing an update on the economy.\n\n&gt; So has any of this materially changed our view (or the Fed\u2019s) on the great inflation debate? Not really.\n\n&gt; This may surprise some given CPI\u2019s and PPI\u2019s large beats relative to expectations, but at least for the next few months we believe that the composition of the inflationary increases is more important than the headline numbers. Headline CPI jumped 0.9% month over month vs. estimates of 0.5%, while core CPI jumped 0.9% month over month vs. estimates of 0.4%. Base effects from rolling off weak numbers a year earlier meant the year-over-year numbers were even more eye-popping. Meanwhile, headline and core PPI both rose 1.0% month over month vs. expectations for 0.5%. Under the hood, though, the theme of both reports is quicker-than-anticipated reopenings are stretching supply chains. The good news there is that those supply chain dynamics have the potential to improve quickly to meet demand and mitigate the lasting effects.\n\n&gt; This is especially true in the auto, travel, hospitality, and food industries. Semiconductor shortages, which are already showing signs of subsiding, are driving shortages in both the new and used car marketplaces. As rental car companies increase their fleets to meet demand, they are increasingly being forced to bid up a limited amount of existing supply. Similarly, labor supply shortages in the leisure and hospitality sector, as well as airline travel, are restricting supply and causing prices to skyrocket. These components all tend to be relatively small parts of the overall CPI basket, but at the moment they are driving an outsized degree of the volatility.\n\n&gt; All of these phenomena can be described as supply chain bottlenecks, which should eventually resolve themselves. For example, the elimination of supplemental unemployment benefits in September should help increase the supply of labor. Rent prices, though, have a greater impact on overall CPI as they account for 41% of the basket, and increases tend to have greater staying power. While they have risen slightly, they are still under control by historical standards, and play a major part in informing our view that inflation will eventually prove to be transitory.\n\n&gt; Fed Chair Powell\u2019s testimony did not break any new ground on the debate either. While the market did perk its ears up when Powell mentioned that the committee is in \u201cactive consideration\u201d over when to begin tapering asset purchases, his characterization of inflation as being mainly transitory and affected by supply chain bottlenecks remained steadfast.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe composition of recent data suggests that inflation will largely prove transitory as the Fed has stated,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cJust how long \u2018transitory\u2019 will prove to be is the big question. We are in the middle of the season when we expected to see some hot prints, so this week has not necessarily been a surprise. But with each passing report market participants will be increasingly anxious to see those numbers start to moderate.\u201d\n\n&gt; What is market pricing telling us about inflation? As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, the market seems to be largely buying into the Fed\u2019s narrative of transitory elevated inflation so far.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.16.21-Blog-2-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Breakeven inflation rates, market-based measures of inflation expectations over given timeframes, rose steadily until roughly the release of the April CPI report when we started hearing about peak inflation concerns. Though that report beat consensus estimates, the subsequent drop in both 5- and 10-year breakevens suggests the market accepted the Fed\u2019s characterization of inflation as transitory.\n\n&gt; And while the levels of these series can be volatile, we believe the divergence that began around the New Year is telling. 5-year breakevens began outpacing 10-year breakevens, suggesting that inflation may run hotter in the near-to-intermediate term, but that the market still has faith in the Fed to keep long-term inflation under control. 5-years making a new local high in the last week without 10-years following suit suggests that while the market is slightly concerned that transitory may prove to be longer than originally thought, it does not believe it will cause concerns on a longer horizon.\n\n&gt; Rents and wages continue to be areas we monitor as tells on whether inflation may be \u201cstickier\u201d than the market anticipates. Our next good look into wage pressure comes on July 30 when we will receive the second quarter Employment Cost Index (ECI) from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This report is important because it keeps the jobs mix it looks at constant. If there is wage pressure it may not show up in average earnings data if the job mix is shifting to lower wage jobs, as we likely have now, but the ECI would capture it.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # S&amp;P 500 Equalweight Lagging Badly\n\n&gt; If you've been following the market over the last couple of months, you've likely noticed that the \"mega-cap\" stocks have been the main driver of the broad market's move higher. You can really see this trend when looking at the performance disparity between the cap-weighted S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and the equal-weight S&amp;P 500 (RSP). (Just to be clear, the main S&amp;P 500 index that's tracked closely across the investment landscape is a cap-weighted index, meaning larger stocks have a bigger impact on its performance than smaller stocks. The lesser-followed equal-weight S&amp;P 500 weights all 500 stocks in the index equally. In the equal-weight S&amp;P 500, Apple (AAPL) -- the largest stock in the index -- and Unum Group (UNM) -- the smallest stock in the index -- have the exact same impact on the index's performance.)\n\n&gt; Yesterday was once again a bad day for most stocks as the equal-weight S&amp;P 500 (RSP) fell more than 0.90% on the day. At the same time, the cap-weighted S&amp;P 500 actually closed slightly higher on the day. As shown below, RSP has been stuck in a sideways pattern for the past two months, essentially going nowhere. SPY, on the other hand, has experienced a nice leg higher and is now very extended above its 50-day moving average. Over the last 12 trading days, SPY has closed at a new high 8 times while RSP has averaged a daily move of -0.02%. While the mega-cap growth stocks spent the time from late 2020 through early 2021 in consolidation, it's not the smaller cap stocks in the index that look to have fallen asleep.

As shown below, RSP is only up 0.33% over the last two months, while SPY is up 4.64%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/rspspy2mth.png))**\n\n&gt; The recent underperformance we've seen from RSP is definitely outside the norm. Below we show the rolling 2-month performance spread between RSP and SPY since RSP began trading in 2003. There have only been two other periods where we've seen the 2-month performance spread turn more negative for the equal-weight S&amp;P versus the cap-weighted S&amp;P. The first was in late October/November 2008 when the entire market was falling rapidly during the Financial Crisis. The second was in late March 2020 during the COVID Crash. These two examples show that we normally see RSP significantly underperform SPY like this when the broad market is falling; not when it's rallying to record highs on a seemingly daily basis.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/2mthspread.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Fewer Bulls Without More Bears\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is flat on the week but the index did tag record highs on Monday. In spite of this, sentiment has turned lower as the AAII survey showed bullish sentiment fall four percentage points to 36.2% this week. That took out the low of 36.4% from the week of May 27th to make for the lowest reading since the last week of October.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/071521-AAII-Bull.png))**\n\n&gt; Some of those declines were picked up by bearish sentiment which rose to 26.8% from 24.5%. Whereas bullish sentiment is at one of the lowest levels in months, that is only the highest level in bearish sentiment since May 13th.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/071521-AAII-Bear.png))**\n\n&gt; With bearish sentiment having risen only slightly while bullish sentiment experiences a more significant decline, the bull-bear spread has fallen to 9.4. That is at the low end of the past several months' range.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/071521-AAII-Bull-Bear.png))**\n\n&gt; Instead, the losses to bullish sentiment have been picked up by the neutral sentiment camp as this week's reading topped 37%. While late May and early June saw similar to slightly higher readings, that level of neutral sentiment is elevated relative to the historical average of 31.43%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/071521-AAII-Neutral.png))**\n\n&gt; Overall, the AAII survey has shown individual investors have become increasingly less optimistic, albeit not outright bearish, over the past few weeks. And while that may be the case for this group, equity newsletter writers have been another story. The sentiment survey from Investors Intelligence (II) covering this section of the market participantshas maintained a more optimistic outlook. This week, 61.2% of respondents reported as bullish which is the highest reading since April. That also comes in the top 5% of all readings since the start of the survey in the early 1960s.\n\n&gt; In the chart below, we show the spread in the bullish sentiment readings of the AAII and Investors Intelligence surveys. This week, that spread fell down to -25 (meaning the percentage of respondents reporting as bullish in the AAII survey is 25 points lower than in the Investors Intelligence survey). That is the lowest reading in the spread since October and it is also in the bottom 5% of all periods.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/071521-AAII-II-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; There have been 20 times in which the spread has dipped below -25 without having done so in the prior six months. As shown, these instances are not particularly rare with about a year or two between each one. But what is notable about the current instance is how elevated the bullish sentiment readings are for each survey. As for what this means for the performance of the S&amp;P 500, in the near term performance has tended to have a negative bias, but moves higher are much more consistently seen in the months to a year after.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/071521-AAII-II-Spread-Table.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending July 16th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 7.18.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.19.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/h3146qZ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.19.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/g9gN2iA.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  7.20.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8hBKbge.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.20.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/YhZCElh.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.21.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Sxu7tNf.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.21.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jPx22l4.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.22.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oEBe8Co.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.22.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/9tMrJQe.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.23.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/qTGKTWP.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.23.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend a great trading week ahead r/smallstreetbets. :)",

This is a major issue because instead of building the infrastructure to produce our own chips, we end up spending billions on foreign products. To combat this problem, the Senate has approved a $52B subsidy plan to help semiconductor manufacturers in the U.S to help boost fabrication. However, it will take time to build the infrastructure.

Amon has helped spearhead Qualcomm's 5G strategy and global markets. Before working at Qualcomm, Amon was the CTO of V\u00e9sper (wireless operator in Brazil). He also worked for NEC and Velocom. Amon has a good track record. He's been in the industry for a long time while holding multiple leadership roles. Qualcomm might be his biggest leadership role yet. I have no doubt that Cristiano Amon will use his prior knowledge to help guide QCOM into a bright future. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n\tWe've seen tremendous growth across the semiconductor industry over the past two years. The recent chip shortage caused by COVID-19 has been driving QCOM's stock price up. Semiconductor manufactures are having trouble keeping up with consumer demand. It is uncertain when the chip shortage will sort itself out. Some experts have said that it could take several years before supply catches up to demand. A few key takeaways from QCOM's financials are Gross Margin and Price/Book ratio. Gross Margin has remained consistent over the past five years. The average gross margin in the semiconductor industry is 33.76%. QCOM is leading the pack at 60% gross margin. The PB ratio seems a little high to me. QCOM currently has a PB ratio of 21.51. To put that into perspective, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) has a PB ratio of 9.05. While Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has a PB of 17.05. This tells me that QCOM might be overvalued at its current price. Overall, I'd say the company's financials are pretty average in the industry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Disclaimer:*\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice\\*\\**\n\n*\\*\\*Do your own research\\*\\**",

        "selftext": " **SHELBY TOWNSHIP, MI / ACCESSWIRE / July 15, 2021 /** Resgreen Group International (OTC PINK:RGGI), a leading mobile robot company, announced today the pilot testing of WandaSA. \n\n \n\n\"WandaSA is currently undergoing extensive testing and validation at the new RGGI facility. We are very pleased with repeatability and accuracy of the system as a whole.\" said Parsh Patel, CEO of Resgreen Group International. \"Using state-of-the-art technology, WandaSA is able to function autonomously. This allows for reduction in human exposure to UV-C and Ozone while ensuring effective and efficient elimination of 99.9 percent of bacteria and viruses. It is a time and cost effective solution for companies looking to streamline their sanitization process.\"\n\nWandaSA uses LiDAR to create a scanned map of its environment, an Intel depth camera to create a 3D point cloud of objects in front of it, and IMU (inertial measurement unit) data to keep track of its location, navigate between points, and save locations. Once the routes are created, the robot moves autonomously along a path without requiring human interaction.\n\nUtilizing the same 17\"x17\" WandaSD size and body type allows WandaSA to navigate through smaller areas with ease. WandaSA is equipped with color and infrared sensors that create two viewable camera feeds. The Wanda App allows for the viewing of the map, the creation of routes by adding points along the way, and the ability to save location names.\n\nRGGI is a leading developer of Artificial Intelligence Robotics (AIRs), Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs), and Automatic Guided Vehicles (AGVs). RGGI's highly skilled engineers have years of experience in the material handling and robotics industries, which has led to significant intellectual property for the company.\n\nRGGI also provides consulting services including backend operational oversight, material handling assessment, work-flow analysis, and steady state yield management using artificial intelligence, technology, and management systems.

        "selftext": "I've watched this stock, and have had some very good swing trades on it over the last year and despite it being near all time highs, I think it's a good buy. The company is in a unique position and is growing at a very good place. Nutritional snack bars and the likes have grown since the lockdowns have ended and people have begun to focus more on weight loss.\n\nThe stock is on a clear uptrend, and I believe that this will continue given the recent growth and profits. They do not pay a dividend, and I believe this company will be focusing on mergers now. The p/e is 40 and this is not a value play necessarily, but I do think that given the circumstances, they will grow into that, and the market seems to agree. \n\nI do not typically do DD on reddit, and I implore anyone with interest to look into them and form your own opinion on It. SMPL has been a resilient stock considering current market conditions and even with the delta variant being priced in, I think the valuation is sustainable. If it falls, I would love to buy more under $30-32. I initially started a position in this company at $21 a share and have since sold my entire position before reentering last week at a cost average of ~$36 a share. Selling puts on the down days may be a good way to sneak in a slightly cheaper cost basis. I also left cash on the side to buy dips, I do not view this as a very risky stock, but I cannot time the market and would like to be liquid enough to buy dips.\n\nUsually I do not go for consumer Staples, but I have liked this stock and I like the trend. This is something different than what I usually post about as well, as I'm big on the oil trade right now, and I'll be honest, it's not going well. So I'm deciding to stop looking at that port for now and ride out the energy earnings and reevaluate in August. I digress.\n\nA couple more picks I do happen to like in this market are  tobacco stocks like MO. \n\nI am starting to be more of a fan of defensive stocks, such as vertex pharmaceuticals and cigna, although I believe it may be too early in the market cycle to make these buys worth the opportunity cost, but they're safe, and very cheap relative to market. \n\nDisney is also one of my favorites, I'd be a buyer at these prices to be honest, it seems to have broken up a bit and seems to be holding above support on lower volume. \n\nIntel is one that I have always liked and I truly like it at this price. I will probably start a position soon. I like the idea of them being in the foundry business and I think that Intel will be able to shine a bit in the next 3-5 years. Not a short term play by any means though.",

        "selftext": "The CCIV to LCID merger has been completed and the ticker change will be happening Monday 7/26. So lets start up with the background on the company. \n\nLeadership: Peter Rawlinson: Current CEO/CTO - Peter has over 30 years of automotive experience. Prior to Lucid, Peter was Vice President of Vehicle Engineering at Tesla and Chief Engineer of the Model S, where he led the engineering of the Model S. \n\nDerek Jenkins: Senior Vice President of Design and Brand - Before joining Lucid, Derek was the Director of Design at Mazda North America Operations where he oversaw all design developments locally and globally. He also spent nine years as the Chief Designer for Volkswagen North America, and eight years with Audi, serving first as Lead Exterior Designer, followed by Assistant Chief Designer for Audi Design. \n\nMichael Bell: Most recently, Michael was Chief Technology Officer for Rivian. He has 30 years in the tech field includes 16 at Apple and five at Intel. At Apple, he played significant roles in the development of iPhone, iMac, AirPort, and Apple TV products.\n\nIn short Lucid team is comprised of leaders with decades of experience in lead roles in automotive and technology industries. \n\nNow, lets talk about the cars. Prior to the Lucid air, Lucid was known for Formula E racing. Lucid\u2019s technology arm Atieva develops and builds the battery packs powering every car on the grid in the world's leading electric racing championship field. Currently Lucid's lineup with consist of 4 models: \nThe Air, available in 2022, from $77,400. \n Air Touring model, from $95,000\n Air Grand Touring, from $139,000\n Air Dream Edition, at $169,000\nLucid Air EV has a battery capacity of 113.0 kWh and a range reported as high as 517 miles. That is  more efficient than the Model S Long Range Plus, which has a 98.0-kWh capacity and 402 miles of range. Lucid's Dream edition will also boast a modest 1080HP. Lucid currently has reached 10,000 preorders, representing over 650M in anticipated sales. Lucid expects 577 of these to be delivered this year.\n\nIn November, Lucid finished building the first phase of its factory in Casa Grande, Arizona, with the capacity to deliver up to 30,000 units per year initially, with up to 400,000 units annually in the future. The site sits on 590 acres allowing for additional expansion.  The next phase expected to begin later this year \u2013 enabling production of Project Gravity, a premium SUV, and is expected to be fully produced and delivered by 2023. \n\nLucid is also backed by the wealthy Saudi PIF (Public Investment Fund). They will be the largest shareholder, however there are also  other companies in the pipe. Including Fidelity Management &amp; Research, BlackRock, Neuberger Berman, Franklin Templeton, Wellington Management, and Winslow Capital Management.\n\nHowever I've been focusing on the Saudi Fund, they currently hold over 430B in assets, and for such an oil rich company to be backing an EV, if that doesn't scream bullish....The pipe shares will also be locked until at least September 1, so I would not expect a selloff this week. \n\nLucid Currently has 8 showrooms but has plans to open 20 by the end of this year throughout the U.S. and Canada. Long before the SPAC Lucid also promised the Saudi's to build in factory in Saudi Arabia. Talks are the factory would be located somewhere around Jeddah, which would be mark a very significant move as the Middle East shifts its economy from oil to EV's.\n\nAnyways this is my first attempt at a DD so....I'll be trying to read and respond to as many comments as I can.",

        "selftext": "\tSo this is a post i made a couple weeks back and posted to WSB, but we all know what\u2019s happening there and I already started on \npt. 2. I hope this is welcome here!\n\n**AMD Overview**\n\n\tAMD is a global semiconductor company offering x86 microprocessors as standalone or integrated (CPU\u2019s, GPU\u2019s, server systems, Etc\u2026) and intellectual property/ services.\n\n**Products**\n\n\tAMD\u2019s primary products consist of CPU\u2019s and GPU\u2019s which are on par or out performing NVIDIA GPU\u2019s and Intel\u2019s CPU\u2019s. While these other two giants have dominated the market for sometime, AMD\u2019s recent move has evolved from a slow creep to a brisk jog.\n\n**Competition** \n\n\tAMD\u2019s largest competitors are Intel (CPU\u2019s) and NVIDIA (GPU\u2019s). With the release of AMD\u2019s Ryzen processors in 2017, AMD has been steadily over taking Intel\u2019s dominance over market share. AMD\u2019s current market share (over all CPU\u2019s) currently sits at 44%, levels it has not seen since 2005. AMD took 20% of the market share in past 2 years with a significant jump in 2019. Since the release of Ryzen, AMD is now on par or out performing Intel chips and has gained a significant amount of sentiment over the soy boys at intel. AMD is on track to overtake the majority of CPU market share within the next year based on current projections.\n\n\tNow NVIDIA is a whole other beast who currently has a significant advantage over the dGPU market. Nvidia at the end of Q4 2020, held roughly 82% of the market share which was a increase of 9% from the previous year. AMD\u2019s high end GPU\u2019s do not come close to Nvidia\u2019s high end models, UNTIL AMD\u2019s Radeon 6000 series, which are now on par with Nvidia\u2019s cards, either outperforming or underperforming in various tests. AMD catching up to Nvidia is the same move that AMD made against Intel in 2017, 4 years later they are on the verge of overtaking market share. While Nvidia is a monster of a company, I believe that AMD will begin taking more market share from Nvidia. AMD has already taken the game console market.\n\n\tAMD has already proved they are able to take back significant market share with there current and future products, Lisa Su is a genius and I believe she\u2019ll lead the company to Valhalla. What does AMD have that Nvidia does not? Aside from many differences, I think the fact that AMD has an ecosystem will play a significant role in catching up. Now that AMD can evenly compete with both of their rivals, AMD plans on leveraging the fact that they produce CPU\u2019s and GPU\u2019s. There are already incentives to using AMD\u2019s CPU with their GPU rather than an AMD CPU with a Nvidia GPU. With AMD taking the CPU market, retail users will be more likely to stick with the ecosystem, and I\u2019m a big fan of companies producing an ecosystem (laughs in apple)\n\n\tA new player enters the battle. Intel has been working on their own dGPU and will surely be releasing in the next few years, but I believe this will be comparable to Sony vs Microsoft with Nintendo enjoying their best life staring at butterfly\u2019s, covered in drool in the corner lol.\n\n**The Merger**\n\n\tNvidia set to acquire ARM, AMD set to acquire Xilinx. What are they and how are they expected to impact the company?\n\n\tARM - Create and dominate the mobile processor market, covering TV\u2019s, phones, tablets, and other similar products as well as some software applications. I will not be covering much more of ARM in this DD.\n\n\tXilinx - Designs and develops programmable logic products. As far as I can tell this is some big brain shit that I\u2019m sure some booger nosed, mother\u2019s basement living, neck beard having, nerd will easily explain in the comments cuz Wikipedia ain\u2019t cutting it.  \n\n\tIf AMD completes the purchase, which is likely and expected to happen by the end of 2021, Xilinx shares will become worth 1.723 shares of AMD. **DATA FROM LAST 2 WEEKS, INPUT CURRENT NUMBERS TO GET ACCURATE EXCHANGE** AMD is currently trading at 86.10$, meaning that shares of Xilinx will be worth 148.35$ if the deal were to go through right now. Xilinx is currently worth 133.71$, I\u2019m betting heavily that AMD will continue to pump prior to this deal as well.\n\n\tARM will be huge for Nvidia, but this is running into some major road blocks and is likely some ways off or will fall through.\n\n**Financials and Projections**\n\n\t\n\tNet Revenue\u2014 2020 - 9.7B, 2019 - 6.7B, 2018 - 6.5B, 2017 - 5.2B, 2016 - 4.3B\n\tNet Income\u2014    2020 - 2.5B, 2019 - 341M, 2018 - 341M, 2017 - 33M, 2016 - 500M\n\t**There was supposed to be a picture here but i dum**\n\n\tI like your growth G. AMD has steadily increased their financials YoY.\n\t\n\tAMD also decreased their debt to 338 million from 568 million.\n\t\n\t$1.6 billion in cash ($9 billion in total assets, I find cash on hand more important)\n\n\tGPU/CPU sales accounted for $6.5 billion while enterprise accounted for $3.3 billion, GPU/CPU sales saw a 37% increase over 2019 while enterprise saw a 65% increase in 2020. 2021 is set to continue this trend of growth.\n\n\tAMD has a high price target of $169.70, median $107.00, and an average of $103.92. I just read 100\u2019s of pages of 8k\u2019s and 10\u2019ks, plus I\u2019m super attracted to the ole doc Su Bae so I\u2019m betting that it will get a target price upgrade, regardless $103 will make me rich. There is a lot more we could dive into on financials but idk what the fuck I\u2019m doing so nah.\n\n**Risks**\n\n\tI like to plan for more than 1 risk occurring at a time so keep that in mind. Ive highlighted the risks that I find most impactful/ probable. Also keep in mind of global shortages, especially with chips. AMD has contingency plans in place for their top risks, i will cover this in pt. 2.\n\n\t- Intel/ Nvidia\u2019s market share dominance (mostly Nvidia)\n\t- Seasonal sales can make for shit earnings in Q1/Q2\n\t- Reliance on third parties for manufacturing/ distributors\n\t- Xilinx deal falls through\n\t- Jim Cramer also likes this stock\n\n\tThat\u2019s enough risks, what am I a gay bear?\n\n**TLDR**\n\nAMD will moon, Lisa Su is my mommy and is cooking up some tendies, AMD GPU\u2019s are now in Teslas,  obligatory rockets (insert rocket emojis here), lots of words just buy it.\n\nPOS\n150 shares @ 78.50\nJan22 $100/$105C\nLooking for entry into Xilinx cuz I dumb\n**Pt. 2 is coming**",
