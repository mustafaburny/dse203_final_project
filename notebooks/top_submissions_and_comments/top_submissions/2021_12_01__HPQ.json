Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Wednesday, December 1st, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures jump ahead of first trading day of December after omicron fears dent markets](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/30/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n&gt; U.S. stock futures were higher in early trading Wednesday, as companies that benefit from the economic reopening gained along with big energy and pharma.\n*****\n&gt; Dow futures rose 305 points. S&amp;P 500 futures gained 1.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 1.4%.\n*****\n&gt; The gains follow a Tuesday sell-off on Wall Street over fears about the new omicron Covid variant and the Federal Reserve mulling a quicker-than-planned exit from its easy monetary policy.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury yields also moved notably higher, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury note most recently back near 1.5% after falling 8 basis points Tuesday to 1.45% on fears that the pandemic would stifle economic growth.\n*****\n&gt; Merck led gainers on the S&amp;P 500, rising 4% in premarket trading a day after its Covid treatment pill received approval from the Food and Drug Administration, though by a narrow 13-10 margin.\n*****\n&gt; Energy shares also posted sharp gains, with Occidental Petroleum up 3.4% as West Texas Intermediate prices climbed more than 4% to nearly $69 a barrel.\n*****\n&gt; Elsewhere in early trading, stocks associated with the economic reopening also posted strong gains. Carnival was up 2.9%, Wynn Resorts gained 2.6% and Hilton Worldwide saw a 2.8% gain.\n*****\n&gt; The moves came a day after the Dow lost more than 650 points, the S&amp;P 500 shed 1.9% and the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite dipped 1.6%. The small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 tumbled 1.9% as cyclical names dragged on the markets.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOur sense is that the recent selloff is a longer-term buying opportunity. However, investors that want to avoid a potential big drawdown (while giving up some potential upside) may want to wait until the [Fed\u2019s] Dec. 15 meeting,\u201d Wolfe Research strategist Chris Senyek said in a note to clients.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell jolted markets after he said the central bank is expected to discuss speeding up the taper of its minimum $120 billion a month bond-buying program. Despite the potential disruption of omicron, the Fed chief said he thinks reducing the pace of monthly bond buys can move quicker than the $15 billion-a-month schedule announced earlier this month.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAt this point, the economy is very strong and inflationary pressures are higher, and it is therefore appropriate in my view to consider wrapping up the taper of our asset purchases ... perhaps a few months sooner,\u201d Powell said. \u201cI expect that we will discuss that at our upcoming meeting.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Goldman Sachs said it projects the Fed will double the pace to $30 billion a month and enact its first rate hike of the pandemic era in June.\n*****\n&gt; The major averages have seen several volatile sessions, starting last Friday when the Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced its worst day since October 2020. Stocks rebounded on Monday, only to turn downward again on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; Wednesday marks the first trading day of the final month of 2021.\n*****\n&gt; Expediting the removal of the Fed\u2019s easy policies tells investors that the central bank is focusing on addressing inflation, instead of new threats from the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMarkets appear to be having trouble digesting the combo of elevated uncertainty around the impact of the Omicron variant and a hawkish Fed pivot in the context of persistently elevated inflation,\u201d said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.\n*****\n&gt; The new Covid variant, first detected in South Africa, has now been identified in more than a dozen countries, causing many to restrict travel. Denting sentiment on Tuesday, the Moderna CEO told the Financial Times that he expects existing vaccines to be less effective against the new variant.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks wrapped up a volatile month of trading on Tuesday. The Dow lost 3.7% for its second month of losses in three. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.25% in November. The Russell 2000 shed 4.3% in November, its worst month since March 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Still, the major averages are up solidly for the year. The Dow is up 12.7% and the S&amp;P 500 is up 21.6% in 2021. The Nasdaq Composite is up an impressive 20.6% this year.\n*****\n&gt; ADP\u2019s private payroll data for November showed 534,000 jobs added in November, above expectations of 506,000\n*****\n&gt; On Wednesday, investors will be evaluating updates on the omicron variant, as well as some key economic reports. November\u2019s Manufacturing PMI, ISM Manufacturing print and October\u2019s construction spending are set to release on Wednesday morning.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/8Kedb0c.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CZnVYrP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/XAbNcjb.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Jml9Z5I.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/5KwRD2M.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($LI $CRM $CRWD $DOCU $SNOW $AI $DG $MRVL $ZS $ASAN $OKTA $ULTA $AMBA $NTAP $SIG $EXPR $HPE $BBW $BQ $BNS $JKS $FRO $MOMO $HIBB $SPLK $SWBI $QH $RY $CHS $BZUN $FIVE $BOX $VERU $YJ $KR $CTRN $TD $VEEV $BIG $GMS $DOOO $CM $EMKR $PVH)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/5ocvp67.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($CRM $ZS $AMBA $NTAP $HPE $BBW $BOX $RY $EMKR $DOOO $GIII $REX $DCI $PDCO $GFS $AIP $VBNK $SDIG)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/lCtopUt.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/o7ET4fR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/odyatZm.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rIUTfTU.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/X0CaSOZ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/paTa9DS.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/6LhmSMe.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/NQh0VqW.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/lNszsgs.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/TQK2vhS.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/kZvQYzi.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/m6LPOsg.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* BYSI\n* REQ.X\n* VXRT\n* NIO\n* AAPL\n* MATIC.X\n* ATNF\n* AERC\n* OP\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/01/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-salesforce-allbirds-doordash-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Salesforce** \u2014 Shares of the software giant dropped more than 6% in premarket trading despite a better-than-expected third-quarter earnings report.

Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Wednesday, December 1st, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures jump ahead of first trading day of December after omicron fears dent markets](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/30/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n&gt; U.S. stock futures were higher in early trading Wednesday, as companies that benefit from the economic reopening gained along with big energy and pharma.\n*****\n&gt; Dow futures rose 305 points. S&amp;P 500 futures gained 1.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 1.4%.\n*****\n&gt; The gains follow a Tuesday sell-off on Wall Street over fears about the new omicron Covid variant and the Federal Reserve mulling a quicker-than-planned exit from its easy monetary policy.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury yields also moved notably higher, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury note most recently back near 1.5% after falling 8 basis points Tuesday to 1.45% on fears that the pandemic would stifle economic growth.\n*****\n&gt; Merck led gainers on the S&amp;P 500, rising 4% in premarket trading a day after its Covid treatment pill received approval from the Food and Drug Administration, though by a narrow 13-10 margin.\n*****\n&gt; Energy shares also posted sharp gains, with Occidental Petroleum up 3.4% as West Texas Intermediate prices climbed more than 4% to nearly $69 a barrel.\n*****\n&gt; Elsewhere in early trading, stocks associated with the economic reopening also posted strong gains. Carnival was up 2.9%, Wynn Resorts gained 2.6% and Hilton Worldwide saw a 2.8% gain.\n*****\n&gt; The moves came a day after the Dow lost more than 650 points, the S&amp;P 500 shed 1.9% and the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite dipped 1.6%. The small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 tumbled 1.9% as cyclical names dragged on the markets.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOur sense is that the recent selloff is a longer-term buying opportunity. However, investors that want to avoid a potential big drawdown (while giving up some potential upside) may want to wait until the [Fed\u2019s] Dec. 15 meeting,\u201d Wolfe Research strategist Chris Senyek said in a note to clients.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell jolted markets after he said the central bank is expected to discuss speeding up the taper of its minimum $120 billion a month bond-buying program. Despite the potential disruption of omicron, the Fed chief said he thinks reducing the pace of monthly bond buys can move quicker than the $15 billion-a-month schedule announced earlier this month.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAt this point, the economy is very strong and inflationary pressures are higher, and it is therefore appropriate in my view to consider wrapping up the taper of our asset purchases ... perhaps a few months sooner,\u201d Powell said. \u201cI expect that we will discuss that at our upcoming meeting.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Goldman Sachs said it projects the Fed will double the pace to $30 billion a month and enact its first rate hike of the pandemic era in June.\n*****\n&gt; The major averages have seen several volatile sessions, starting last Friday when the Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced its worst day since October 2020. Stocks rebounded on Monday, only to turn downward again on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; Wednesday marks the first trading day of the final month of 2021.\n*****\n&gt; Expediting the removal of the Fed\u2019s easy policies tells investors that the central bank is focusing on addressing inflation, instead of new threats from the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMarkets appear to be having trouble digesting the combo of elevated uncertainty around the impact of the Omicron variant and a hawkish Fed pivot in the context of persistently elevated inflation,\u201d said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.\n*****\n&gt; The new Covid variant, first detected in South Africa, has now been identified in more than a dozen countries, causing many to restrict travel. Denting sentiment on Tuesday, the Moderna CEO told the Financial Times that he expects existing vaccines to be less effective against the new variant.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks wrapped up a volatile month of trading on Tuesday. The Dow lost 3.7% for its second month of losses in three. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.25% in November. The Russell 2000 shed 4.3% in November, its worst month since March 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Still, the major averages are up solidly for the year. The Dow is up 12.7% and the S&amp;P 500 is up 21.6% in 2021. The Nasdaq Composite is up an impressive 20.6% this year.\n*****\n&gt; ADP\u2019s private payroll data for November showed 534,000 jobs added in November, above expectations of 506,000\n*****\n&gt; On Wednesday, investors will be evaluating updates on the omicron variant, as well as some key economic reports. November\u2019s Manufacturing PMI, ISM Manufacturing print and October\u2019s construction spending are set to release on Wednesday morning.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/8Kedb0c.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CZnVYrP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/XAbNcjb.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Jml9Z5I.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/5KwRD2M.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($LI $CRM $CRWD $DOCU $SNOW $AI $DG $MRVL $ZS $ASAN $OKTA $ULTA $AMBA $NTAP $SIG $EXPR $HPE $BBW $BQ $BNS $JKS $FRO $MOMO $HIBB $SPLK $SWBI $QH $RY $CHS $BZUN $FIVE $BOX $VERU $YJ $KR $CTRN $TD $VEEV $BIG $GMS $DOOO $CM $EMKR $PVH)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/5ocvp67.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($CRM $ZS $AMBA $NTAP $HPE $BBW $BOX $RY $EMKR $DOOO $GIII $REX $DCI $PDCO $GFS $AIP $VBNK $SDIG)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/lCtopUt.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/o7ET4fR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/odyatZm.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rIUTfTU.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/X0CaSOZ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/paTa9DS.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/6LhmSMe.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/NQh0VqW.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/lNszsgs.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/TQK2vhS.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/kZvQYzi.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/m6LPOsg.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* BYSI\n* REQ.X\n* VXRT\n* NIO\n* AAPL\n* MATIC.X\n* ATNF\n* AERC\n* OP\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/01/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-salesforce-allbirds-doordash-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Salesforce** \u2014 Shares of the software giant dropped more than 6% in premarket trading despite a better-than-expected third-quarter earnings report.

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the first trading day of December! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Wednesday, December 1st, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures jump ahead of first trading day of December after omicron fears dent markets](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/30/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n&gt; U.S. stock futures were higher in early trading Wednesday, as companies that benefit from the economic reopening gained along with big energy and pharma.\n*****\n&gt; Dow futures rose 305 points. S&amp;P 500 futures gained 1.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 1.4%.\n*****\n&gt; The gains follow a Tuesday sell-off on Wall Street over fears about the new omicron Covid variant and the Federal Reserve mulling a quicker-than-planned exit from its easy monetary policy.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury yields also moved notably higher, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury note most recently back near 1.5% after falling 8 basis points Tuesday to 1.45% on fears that the pandemic would stifle economic growth.\n*****\n&gt; Merck led gainers on the S&amp;P 500, rising 4% in premarket trading a day after its Covid treatment pill received approval from the Food and Drug Administration, though by a narrow 13-10 margin.\n*****\n&gt; Energy shares also posted sharp gains, with Occidental Petroleum up 3.4% as West Texas Intermediate prices climbed more than 4% to nearly $69 a barrel.\n*****\n&gt; Elsewhere in early trading, stocks associated with the economic reopening also posted strong gains. Carnival was up 2.9%, Wynn Resorts gained 2.6% and Hilton Worldwide saw a 2.8% gain.\n*****\n&gt; The moves came a day after the Dow lost more than 650 points, the S&amp;P 500 shed 1.9% and the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite dipped 1.6%. The small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 tumbled 1.9% as cyclical names dragged on the markets.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOur sense is that the recent selloff is a longer-term buying opportunity. However, investors that want to avoid a potential big drawdown (while giving up some potential upside) may want to wait until the [Fed\u2019s] Dec. 15 meeting,\u201d Wolfe Research strategist Chris Senyek said in a note to clients.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell jolted markets after he said the central bank is expected to discuss speeding up the taper of its minimum $120 billion a month bond-buying program. Despite the potential disruption of omicron, the Fed chief said he thinks reducing the pace of monthly bond buys can move quicker than the $15 billion-a-month schedule announced earlier this month.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAt this point, the economy is very strong and inflationary pressures are higher, and it is therefore appropriate in my view to consider wrapping up the taper of our asset purchases ... perhaps a few months sooner,\u201d Powell said. \u201cI expect that we will discuss that at our upcoming meeting.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Goldman Sachs said it projects the Fed will double the pace to $30 billion a month and enact its first rate hike of the pandemic era in June.\n*****\n&gt; The major averages have seen several volatile sessions, starting last Friday when the Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced its worst day since October 2020. Stocks rebounded on Monday, only to turn downward again on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; Wednesday marks the first trading day of the final month of 2021.\n*****\n&gt; Expediting the removal of the Fed\u2019s easy policies tells investors that the central bank is focusing on addressing inflation, instead of new threats from the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMarkets appear to be having trouble digesting the combo of elevated uncertainty around the impact of the Omicron variant and a hawkish Fed pivot in the context of persistently elevated inflation,\u201d said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.\n*****\n&gt; The new Covid variant, first detected in South Africa, has now been identified in more than a dozen countries, causing many to restrict travel. Denting sentiment on Tuesday, the Moderna CEO told the Financial Times that he expects existing vaccines to be less effective against the new variant.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks wrapped up a volatile month of trading on Tuesday. The Dow lost 3.7% for its second month of losses in three. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.25% in November. The Russell 2000 shed 4.3% in November, its worst month since March 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Still, the major averages are up solidly for the year. The Dow is up 12.7% and the S&amp;P 500 is up 21.6% in 2021. The Nasdaq Composite is up an impressive 20.6% this year.\n*****\n&gt; ADP\u2019s private payroll data for November showed 534,000 jobs added in November, above expectations of 506,000\n*****\n&gt; On Wednesday, investors will be evaluating updates on the omicron variant, as well as some key economic reports. November\u2019s Manufacturing PMI, ISM Manufacturing print and October\u2019s construction spending are set to release on Wednesday morning.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/8Kedb0c.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CZnVYrP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/XAbNcjb.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Jml9Z5I.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/5KwRD2M.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/5ocvp67.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/lCtopUt.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/o7ET4fR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/odyatZm.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rIUTfTU.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/X0CaSOZ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/paTa9DS.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/6LhmSMe.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/NQh0VqW.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/lNszsgs.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/TQK2vhS.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/kZvQYzi.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/m6LPOsg.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/01/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-salesforce-allbirds-doordash-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Salesforce** \u2014 Shares of the software giant dropped more than 6% in premarket trading despite a better-than-expected third-quarter earnings report.

Our OEM projects typically kick off one to three years before initial sales, depending on product capacity.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Already, our order book for next year is at least $1.5 billion, and our team is currently working to ensure we can deliver this. Next quarter, we will provide an update on our work. And at the start of next year, we will provide our official 2022 revenue guidance**.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I will say, our client revenue will continue to grow. Although PCIe Gen3 next year growth rate will be modestly, but PCIe Gen will grow very strong to carry because we have a very large design share in PC OEM. We stated almost 50% higher by end of the next year so that we have eight different customer, five on NAND maker with our PCIe Gen4 controller and ramping next year. For eMMC+UFS, we also will grow very, very strongly. It also depends how many wafer we can secure.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We say it's going not to grow for a certain level, **we guarantee is exceed the $1 billion of revenue next year**. But we think the backlog will continue to pile up by end of this year. But we'll continue to work very hard to secure more wafer, especially in mature technology because many eMMC are in 55, 40-nanometer and 28 meter, these mature technology wafer are in severe allocation from all foundry makers. So this is very critical, how fast we can porting, work with TSMC as well as other foundry that can grow overall the eMMC+UFS business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis guidance was confirmed on SIMO's [Q3 2021 earnings call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/28/silicon-motion-technology-corporation-simo-q3-2021/):\n\n&gt; In the third quarter, sales and earnings reached another quarterly company record. **Revenue grew 15% sequentially and over 100% year-over-year to $254 million**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We expect this situation of demanding excess of supply to continue through next year since foundry capacity will likely only start improving in 2023. Our order book remains strong and continues to be well in excess of $1.5 billion for next year.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;**In the third quarter, we delivered $1 billion in revenue run rate a quarter ahead of when we had previously communicated and expect our revenue run rate to increase further in the fourth quarter** as we focus on managing our product mix, customer allocation and pricing. We have already received foundry wafer allocation for 2022. **That is incremental to what we have this year, and we are confident we can grow ourselves next year toward our $1.5 billion order book.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I think based on the third quarter revenue and fourth quarter guidance, we are ready at a $1 billion sale revenue rate with our current wafer supply. We have already received foundry wafer allocation for 2022 as we state. **That's incremental to what we have this year, and we are confident we can grow our sales next year to around $1.5 billion.** We believe the demand will continue to exceed supply next year, but I think we definitely will continue to negotiate and discover TSMC to gain more wafer supply. Regarding the $1.5 billion backlog, I think we -- **our backlog remained very solid with the purchase order of 2022, continued to be well in excess of $1.5 billion**. Most of the backlog consists SSD and eMMC+UFS controller order \\[Indecipherable\\] 23:35. An OEM order is strong because our customers have been gaining share, and we have been gaining share of \\[Indecipherable\\] 23:41 as these customers. We believe we have secured about 50% of all PC OEM and PCIe Gen four socket for next year. But we have seen, however, some adjustment in our order book with the softening of order for channel market product and strengthening our product for OEM customer. For example, we are seeing demand for SSD by global PC OEM continue to strengthen, our current client SSD for retail market, especially in China, softening. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI repeat: management guarantees that revenue will exceed $1B in 2022.\n\nNow what do the anal(ysts) think?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-----\n\n**Analyst Estimates**\n\n* Morgan Stanley research: price target of $78 with only $1B of revenue modelled in 2022 / 2023\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zq7z1bccey281.png?width=473&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8fe6bf8cde6597ea7db096112c377fa7771dd3c3\n\n* Bank of America research: price target of $80 with only \\~$850M of revenue modelled in 2022 / 2023\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ia6skvysey281.png?width=502&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f326906c0291c5bf0a9323ae7a3f7a1ecb52418b\n\nNeedham is the only analyst properly reflecting $1.5B of revenue in 2022.
