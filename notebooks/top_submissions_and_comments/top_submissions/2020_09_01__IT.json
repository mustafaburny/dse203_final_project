        "selftext": "*edit: thanks for the awards. I'd be a dick to take credit. Go check out the one-man-band who actually wrote it---I've been reading for a couple months, good stuff*   [*https://bestinterest.blog/explain-the-big-short/*](https://bestinterest.blog/explain-the-big-short/)\n\n(Best Interest) This post will **explain the Big Short and the 2008 subprime mortgage collapse in simple terms.**\n\nThis post is a little longer than usual\u2013maybe give yourself 20 minutes to sift through it. But I promise you\u2019ll leave feeling like you can tranche (that\u2019s a verb, right?!) the whole financial system!\n\n**Key Players**\n\nFirst, I want to introduce the players in the financial crisis, as they might not make sense at first blush. One of the worst parts about the financial industry is how they use deliberately obtuse language to explain relatively simple ideas. Their financial acronyms are hard to keep track of. In order to explain the Big Short, these players\u2013and their roles\u2013are key.\n\n**Individuals**, a.k.a. regular people who take out mortgages to buy houses; for example, you and me!\n\n**Mortgage lenders**, like a local bank or a mortgage lending specialty shop, who give out mortgages to individuals. Either way, they\u2019re probably local people that the individual home-buyer would meet in person.\n\n**Big** **banks**, such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, who buy lots of mortgages from lenders. After this transaction, the homeowner would owe money to the big bank instead of the lender.\n\n**Collateralized debt obligations (CDOs)**\u2014deep breath!\u2014who take mortgages from big banks and bundle them all together into a bond (see below). And just like before, this step means that the home-buyer now owes money to the CDO. Why is this done?! I\u2019ll explain, I promise.\n\n**Ratings agencies**, whose job is to determine the risk of a CDO\u2014is it filled with safe mortgages, or risky mortgages?\n\n**Investors**, who buy part of a CDO and get repaid as the individual homeowners start paying back their mortgage.\n\nFeel lost already? I\u2019m going to be a good jungle guide and get you through this. Stick with me.\n\n**Quick definition: Bonds**\n\nA **bond** can be thought of as a loan. When you buy a bond, you are *loaning* your money. The issuer of the bond is *borrowing* your money. In exchange for borrowing your money, the issuer promises to pay you back, plus interest, in a certain amount of time. Sometimes, the borrower cannot pay the investor back, and the bond *defaults,* or fails. Defaults are not good for the investor.\n\nThe CDO\u2014which is a bond\u2014could hold thousands of mortgages in it. It\u2019s a mortgage-backed bond, and therefore a type of mortgage-backed security. If you bought 1% of a CDO, you were *loaning* money equivalent to 1% of all the mortgage principal, with the hope of collecting 1% of the principal *plus interest* as the mortgages got repaid.\n\nThere\u2019s one more key player, but I\u2019ll wait to introduce it. First\u2026\n\n**The Whys**, Explained\n\n**Why does an individual take out a mortgage?** Because they want a home. Can you blame them?! A healthy housing market involves people buying and selling houses.\n\n**How about the lender; why do they lend?** It *used* to be so they would slowly make interest money as the mortgage got repaid. But nowadays, the lender takes a fee (from the homeowner) for creating (or *originating*) the mortgage, and then immediately sells to mortgage to\u2026\n\n**A big bank. Why do they buy mortgages from lenders?** Starting in the 1970s, Wall St. started buying up groups of loans, tying them all together into one bond\u2014the CDO\u2014and selling slices of that collection to investors. When people buy and sell those slices, the big banks get a cut of the action\u2014a commission.\n\n**Why would an investor want a slice of a mortgage CDO?** Because, like any other investment, the big banks promised that the investor would make their money back *plus interest* once the homeowners began repaying their mortgages.\n\nYou can almost trace the flow of money and risk from player to player.\n\nAt the end of the day, the investor needs to get repaid, and that money comes from homeowners.\n\n**CDOs are empty buckets**\n\nHomeowners and mortgage lenders are easy to understand. But a big question mark swirls around Wall Street\u2019s CDOs.\n\nI like to think of the CDO as a football field full of empty buckets\u2014one bucket per mortgage. As an investor, you don\u2019t purchase one single bucket, or one mortgage. Instead, you purchase a thin horizontal slice across all the buckets\u2014say, a half-inch slice right around the 1-gallon mark.\n\nAs the mortgages are repaid, it starts raining. The repayments\u2014or rain\u2014from **Mortgage A** doesn\u2019t go solely into **Bucket A**, but rather is distributed across all the buckets, and all the buckets slowly get re-filled.\n\nAs long as your horizontal slice of the bucket is eventually surpassed, you get your money back plus interest. You don\u2019t need *every* mortgage to be repaid. You just need *enough* mortgages to get to your slice.\n\nIt makes sense, then, that the tippy top of the bucket\u2014which gets filled up last\u2014is the highest risk. If too many of the mortgages in the CDO fail and aren\u2019t repaid, then the tippy top of the bucket will never get filled up, and those investors won\u2019t get their money back.\n\nThese horizontal slices are called ***tranches***, which might sound familiar if you\u2019ve read the book or watched the movie.\n\nSo far, there\u2019s nothing too wrong about this practice. It\u2019s simply moving the risk from the mortgage lender to other investors. Sure, the middle-men (banks, lenders, CDOs) are all taking a cut out of all the buy and sell transactions. But that\u2019s no different than buying lettuce at grocery store prices vs. buying straight from the farmer. Middle-men take a cut. It happens.\n\nBut now, our final player enters the stage\u2026\n\n**Credit Default Swaps: The Lynchpin of the Big Short**\n\nScrew you, Wall Street nomenclature! A **credit default swap** sounds complicated, but it\u2019s just **insurance**. Very simple, but they have a key role to explain the Big Short.\n\nInvestors thought, \u201cWell, since I\u2019m buying this **risky** tranche of a CDO, I might want to hedge my bets a bit and buy **insurance** in case it fails.\u201d That\u2019s what a credit default swap did. It\u2019s insurance against something failing. But, there is a **vital** difference between a credit default swap and normal insurance.\n\nI can\u2019t buy an insurance policy on *your* house, on *your* car, or on *your* life. Only *you* can buy those policies. But, I could buy insurance on a CDO mortgage bond, *even if I didn\u2019t own that bond!*\n\nNot only that, but I could buy **billions** of dollars of insurance on a CDO that only contained **millions** of dollars of mortgages.\n\nIt\u2019s like taking out a $1 million auto policy on a Honda Civic. No insurance company would allow you to do this, but it was happening all over Wall Street before 2008. This scenario essentially *is* \u201cthe big short\u201d (see below)\u2014making huge insurance bets that CDOs will fail\u2014and many of the big banks were on the wrong side of this bet!\n\nCredit default swaps involved the largest amounts of money in the subprime mortgage crisis. This is where the big Wall Street bets were taking place.\n\nQuick definition: Short\n\nA short is a bet that something will fail, get worse, or go down. When most people invest, they buy **long** (\u201cI want this stock price to go up!\u201d). A **short** is the opposite of that.\n\nCertain individuals\u2014like main characters Steve Eisman (aka Mark Baum in the movie, played by Steve Carrell) and Michael Burry (played by Christian Bale) in the 2015 Oscar-nominated film **The Big Short**\u2014realized that tons of mortgages were being made to people who would never be able to pay them back.\n\nIf enough mortgages failed, then tranches of CDOs start to fail\u2014no mortgage repayment means no rain, and no rain means the buckets stay empty. If CDOs fail, then the credit default swap insurance gets paid out. So what to do? ***Buy credit default swaps!*** That\u2019s the quick and dirty way to explain the Big Short.\n\n**Why buy Dog Shit?**\n\nWait a second. Why did people originally invest in these CDO bonds if they were full of \u201cdog shit mortgages\u201d (direct quote from the book) in the first place? Since **The Big Short** protagonists knew what was happening, shouldn\u2019t the investors also have realized that the buckets would never get refilled?\n\nFor one, the *prospectus*\u2014a fancy word for \u201cowner\u2019s manual\u201d\u2014of a CDO was very difficult to parse through. It was hard to understand exactly which mortgages were in the CDO. *This is a skeevy big bank/CDO practice*. And even if you knew which mortgages were in a CDO, it was nearly impossible to realize that many of those mortgages were made *fraudulently*.\n\n**The mortgage lenders were knowingly creating bad mortgages**\\*.\\* They were giving loans to people with no hopes of repaying them. Why? Because the lenders knew they could immediately sell that mortgage\u2014that *risk*\u2014to a big bank, which would then *securitize* the mortgage into a CDO, and then sell that CDO to investors. Any risk that the lender took by creating a bad mortgage was quickly transferred to the investor.\n\nSo\u2026because you can\u2019t decipher the prospectus to tell which mortgages are in a CDO, it was easier to rely on the CDO\u2019s **rating** than to evaluate each of the underlying mortgages. It\u2019s the same reason why you don\u2019t have to understand how engines work when you buy a car; you just look at Car &amp; Driver or Consumer Reports for their opinions, their ratings.\n\n**The Ratings Agencies**\n\nInvestors often relied on ratings to determine which bonds to buy. The two most well-known ratings agencies from 2008 were Moody\u2019s and Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s (heard of the **S&amp;P** 500?). The ratings agency\u2019s job was to look at a CDO that a big bank created, understand the underlying assets (in this case, the mortgages), and give the CDO a rating to determine how safe it was. A good rating is \u201cAAA\u201d\u2014so nice, it got \u2018A\u2019 thrice.\n\nSo, were the ratings agencies doing their jobs? **No!** There are a few explanations for this:\n\n1. Even they\u2014the experts in charge of grading the bonds\u2014didn\u2019t understand what was going on inside a CDO. The owner\u2019s manual descriptions (prospectuses) were too complicated. In fact, ratings agencies often *relied on big banks to teach seminars* about how to rate CDOs, which is like a teacher learning how to grade tests from Timmy, who still pees his pants. *Timmy just wants an A*.\n2. Ratings agencies are profit-driven companies. When they give a rating, they charge a fee. But if the agency hands out too many bad grades, then their customers\u2014the big banks\u2014will take their requests elsewhere in hopes of higher grades. The ratings agencies weren\u2019t *objective*, but instead were biased by their need for profits.\n3. Remember those fraudulent mortgages that the lenders were making? Unless you did some boots-on-the-ground research, it was tough to uncover this fact. It\u2019s hard to blame the ratings agencies for not catching this.\n\n**Who\u2019s to blame?**\n\nEveryone? Let\u2019s play devil\u2019s advocate\u2026\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Individuals**: some people      point the finger at homeowners, saying, \u201cYou should know better than to      buy a $1 million house on a teacher\u2019s salary.\u201d I find this hard to      swallow. These people, surrounded by the American home-ownership dream,      were sold the idea that they would be fine. The mortgage lender had no      incentive to sell a *good* mortgage, they only had an      incentive to sell *a* mortgage. So, it\u2019s hard for me to put      too much blame on the homeowners.\n* **Mortgage      lenders**: *someone* knew.      I\u2019m not saying that all the mortgage lenders were fully aware of the      implications of their actions, but some people knew that fraudulent loans      were being made, and chose to ignore that fact. For example, check      out [whistleblower Eileen Foster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eileen_Foster).\n* **Big      banks**:      Yes sir! There\u2019s certainly blame here. Rather than get into all of the      various money-grubbing, I want to call out one specific anecdote. Back in      2010, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein testified in front of Congress.      Here it is:\n\nTo explain further, there are two things going on here.\n\nFirst, Goldman Sachs bankers were selling CDOs to investors. They wanted to make a commission on the sale.\n\nAt the same time, other bankers **ALSO AT GOLDMAN SACHS** were buying credit default swaps, a.k.a. betting *against* the same CDOs that the first Goldman Sachs bankers were selling.\n\nThis is like selling someone a racehorse with cancer, and then immediately going to the track to bet against that horse. Blankfein\u2019s defense in this video is, \u201cBut the horse seller and the bettor weren\u2019t the same people!\u201d And the Congressmen responds, \u201cBut they worked for the same stable, and collected the same paychecks!\u201d\n\nSo do the big banks deserve blame? You tell me.\n\n**Inspecting Goldman Sachs**\n\nOne reason Goldman Sachs survived 2008 is that they began buying credit default swaps (insurance) *just* in time before the housing market crashed. They were still on the bad side of some bets, but mostly on the good side. They were net profitable.\n\nUnfortunately for them, the banks that owed Goldman money were going bankrupt from their *own* debt, and then Goldman never would have been able to collect on their insurance. Goldman would\u2019ve had to payout on their \u201cbad\u201d bets, while not collecting on their \u201cgood\u201d bets. In their own words, they were [\u201ctoast.\u201d](https://bettermarkets.com/newsroom/email-shows-goldman-admitted-it-was-toast)\n\nThis is significant. Even banks in \u201cgood\u201d positions would\u2019ve gone bankrupt, because the people who owed the most money weren\u2019t able to repay all their debts. Imagine a chain; Bank A owes money to Bank B, and B owes money to Bank C. If Bank A fails, then B can\u2019t collect their debt, and B can\u2019t pay C. Bank C made \u201cgood\u201d bets, but aren\u2019t able to collect on them, and then they go out of business.\n\nThese failures would\u2019ve rippled throughout the world. This explains why the US government felt it necessary to bail-out the banks. That federal money allowed banks in \u201cgood\u201d positions to collect their profits and \u201cstop the ripple\u201d from tearing apart the world economy. While CDOs and credit default swap explain the Big Short starting, this ripple of failure is the mechanism that affected the entire world.\n\nBetting more than you have\n\nBut if someone made a bad bet\u2014sold bad insurance\u2014why didn\u2019t they have money to cover that bet? It all depends on [risk](https://bestinterest.blog/2019/10/18/risk-posture/). If you sell a $100 million insurance policy, and you think there\u2019s a 1% chance of paying out that policy, what\u2019s your exposure? It\u2019s the potential loss multiplied by the probability = 1% times $100 million, or $1 million.\n\nThese banks sold billions of dollars of insurance under the assumption that there was a  5%, or 3%, or 1% chance of the housing market failing. So they had 20x, or 30x, or 100x **less** money on hand then they needed to cover these bets.\n\nTurns out, there was a 100% chance that the market would fail\u2026**oops!**\n\nBlame, expounded\n\n**Ratings agencies**\u2014they should be unbiased. But they sold themselves off for profit. They invited the wolves\u2014big banks\u2014into their homes to teach them how to grade CDOs. Maybe they should read a blog to explain the Big Short to them. Of course they deserve blame. Here\u2019s another anecdote of terrible judgment from the ratings agencies:\n\nThink back to my analogy of the buckets and the rain. Sometimes, a ratings agency would look at a CDO and say, \u201cYou\u2019re never going to fill up these buckets all the way. Those final tranches\u2014the ones that won\u2019t get filled\u2014they\u2019re **really** risky. So we\u2019re going to give them a bad grade.\u201d  There were \u201cDog Shit\u201d tranches, and Dog Shit gets a bad grade.\n\nBut then the CDO managers would go back to their offices and cut off the top of the buckets. And they\u2019d do this for all their CDOs\u2014cutting off all the bucket-top rings from all the different CDO buckets. And then they\u2019d super-glue the bucket-top rings together to create a field full of Frankenstein buckets, officially called a **CDO squared**. Because the Frankenstein buckets were originally part of other CDOs, the Frankenstein buckets could only start filling up once the original buckets (which now had the tops cut off) were filled. In other words, the CDO managers decided to concentrate all their Dog Shit in one place, and super glue it together.\n\nA reasonable person would look at the Frankenstein Dog Shit field of buckets and say, \u201cThat\u2019s turrible, Kenny.\u201d\n\n**BUT THE RATINGS AGENCIES GAVE CDO-SQUAREDs HIGH GRADES!!!** Oh I\u2019m sorry, *was I yelling?!*\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s *diversified*,\u201d they would claim, as if Poodle shit mixed with Labrador shit is better than pure Poodle shit.\n\nAgain, you tell me. Do the ratings agencies deserve blame?!\n\nDoes the government deserve blame?\n\nYes and no.\n\nFor example, part of the **Housing and Community Development Act of 1992** mandated that the government mortgage finance firms (Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae) purchase a certain number of sub-prime mortgages.\n\nOn its surface, this seems like a good thing: it\u2019s giving money to potential home-buyers who wouldn\u2019t otherwise qualify for a mortgage. It\u2019s providing the American Dream.\n\nBut as we\u2019ve already covered today, it does nobody any good to provide a bad mortgage to someone who can\u2019t repay it. That\u2019s what caused this whole calamity. Freddie and Fannie and HUD were pumping money into the machine, helping to enable it. Good intentions, but they weren\u2019t paying attention to the unintended outcomes.\n\nAnd what about the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC), the watchdogs of Wall Street. Do they have a role to explain the Big Short? Shouldn\u2019t they have been aware of the Big Banks, the CDOs, the ratings agencies?\n\nYes, they deserve blame too. They\u2019re supposed to do things like ensure that Big Banks have enough money on hand to cover their risky bets. This is called proper \u201crisk management,\u201d and it was *severely* lacking. The SEC also had the power to dig into the CDOs and ferret out the fraudulent mortgages that were creating them. Why didn\u2019t they do that?\n\nPerhaps the issue is that the SEC was/is simply too close to Wall Street, similar to the ratings agencies getting advice from the big banks. Watchdogs shouldn\u2019t get treats from those they\u2019re watching. Or maybe it\u2019s that the CDOs and credit default swaps were too hard for the SEC to understand.\n\nEither way, the SEC doesn\u2019t have a good excuse. If you\u2019re in bed with the people you\u2019re regulating, then you\u2019re doing a bad job. If you\u2019re rubber stamping things you don\u2019t understand, then you\u2019re doing a bad job.\n\n**Explain the Big Short**, shortly\n\nYou\u2019re about 2500 words into my \u201cshort summary.\u201d But the important things to remember:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Financial      acronyms suck.\n* Money      flowed from the investors down to the mortgage lenders, and the risk      flowed from the mortgage lenders up to the investors. In between, the big      banks and CDOs acted as middle men and intermediaries.\n* When      someone feels like their actions have no risk, or no consequences, they\u2019ll      behave poorly (big banks, mortgage lenders)When someone is given what seems like an amazing deal, they\u2019ll take it      (individual home owners).\n* CDOs      are like empty buckets. Mortgage payments are like rain, filling the      buckets. Investors buy tranches, or slices, across all the buckets. If      mortgages fail, then the buckets might not fill up, and the investors      won\u2019t get their money back.\n* CDOs      are intentionally complex. So complex, that not even the people grading      them understood what was going on (ratings agencies).\n* Buying      insurance on something your do not own is a behavior with potential for      abuse (big banks)\n* Buying      insurance on something for more than it\u2019s worth is a behavior with      potential for abuse (big banks). This is where most of the money in the      financial crisis switched hands.\n\nAnd with that, I\u2019d like to announce the opening of the Best Interest CDO. Rather than invest in mortgages, I\u2019ll be investing in race horses. Don\u2019t ask my why, but the current top stallion is named \u2018Dog Shit.\u2019 He\u2019ll take Wall Street by storm.\n\nIf you don\u2019t mind my cussing but you do like this content, consider [**subscribing to the email list**](https://bestinterest.blog/subscribe/) to get these articles (and nothing more) sent to your inbox every week.\n\nI hope this post helped if you were looking for someone to explain the Big Short.

        "selftext": "Tesla's exclusion from the S&amp;P 500 index on Friday was a surprise to many, given that the mega-cap electric-vehicle manufacturer ticked off all the eligibility requirements.\n\nTesla on Tuesday fell 21% from Friday's close as investors digested the S&amp;P 500 exclusion amid a tech-heavy market sell-off.\n\nBut the S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices index committee's decision to exclude Tesla despite its eligibility for inclusion was a \"brave\" one, DataTrek cofounder Nicholas Colas said in a note on Wednesday.\n\nThe decision by the committee could \"only have come from a collective and committed view that Tesla is profoundly overvalued,\" Colas said.\n\nTesla traded at a trailing 12-month price-earnings multiple of 913x on Wednesday, according to data from YCharts.com. The S&amp;P 500 traded at a trailing 12-month price-earnings multiple of 21.7x, according to JPMorgan.\n\nIn addition to a steep valuation, the committee likely thinks Tesla \"sits on shakier fundamentals\" than its August 31 market capitalization of $465.2 billion may indicate, DataTrek said.\n\nThat might refer to the fact that much of the profit Tesla has recorded over the past few quarters derives from the sale of green EV regulatory credits to other carmakers that don't meet the mandated annual EV production quota, and not from Tesla's main business of building and selling cars and solar panels.\n\nTesla will remain eligible for inclusion in the S&amp;P 500 index if it continues to stay profitable in future quarters.\n\nInstead of Tesla, the committee added Etsy, Teradyne, and Catalent to the S&amp;P 500 index.\n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-stock-sp500-exclusion-index-overvalued-profoundly-datatrek-committee-why-2020-9",

Epic knew that it was breaching its contract with Apple when it published the update, but did it anyway, she said, accusing the company of dishonesty. She rejected claims that Apple's in-app payment system is a separate product an an example of illegal bundling, as well as that Apple's app store operates as a monopoly.\n\n* Fortnite players on iOS have a variety of choices to access the game even if it is no longer available on iOS, she said. \"Walled gardens have existed for decades,\" she said. \"Nintendo has had a walled garden. Sony has had a walled garden. Microsoft has had a walled garden. What Apple's doing is not much different... It's hard to ignore the economics of the industry, which is what you're asking me to do.\"\n\n* Separately on Monday, Google announced it will enforce rules that require app developers distributing Android software on the Google Play Store to use its in-app payment system. The move means that developers who have had customers pay them directly with a credit card for digital content will soon have to use Google\u2019s billing system, which takes a 30% fee from payments.",

This stock is rolling down to delisted like it's shitty fake truck and you are dumb and in denial if you don't realise that.\n\nLet's look at the evidence.\n\nToday Hindenburg released a reply to NKLA rebuttal: [https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola-response/](https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola-response/) Please, just read this before you even reply. Anyone with any critical thinking skills can clearly see that this scam got caught with it's pants down at a child daycare.

GM is robbing this company of it's EV subsidy (First 200k cars sold), GM gets 11% of NKLA, GM gets 700 million from NKLA (lol how the fuck is NKLA gonna pay GM 700million) with no drawbacks. The only thing NKLA contributes to GM here is their brand name (marketting), that's literally it. If either the SEC or DoJ finds anything that they can use to bury NKLA, which they definitely will, GM is going to pull out of the deal. Remember, they have until 30th Dec to pull out, and I bet the board are talking about it and weighing up their options. If any of the other collaborations pull out, that would be a catalyst for others. This argument that GM is defending NKLA makes no sense. If they didn't defend NKLA, GM stock would collapse and CEO fired. GM has no downsides to defending NKLA at all, and gains so much from this deal.\n\nNow, lets value this stock. It's worth $13billion which is almost 1/3 GM. So what are we getting for 13 billion?\n\nA factory? No, it's dirt field that hasn't even gotten permits for construction.\n\nExclusive tech? No, as shown in Hindenburg they have no tech of their own. 11 patents to it's names and if you read the patents, they're literally junk\n\nTalented workforce? I don't even need to say anything here\n\nMarketting? Outsourced\n\nWorking prototype? Hill\n\nFuck this company, let's watch it burn tomorrow.",

        "selftext": "(Bloomberg) -- Nikola Corp. has left a trail of inconsistent statements and contradictory announcements that are now coming under scrutiny from short-sellers eager to poke holes in the electric-vehicle company\u2019s success story.\n\nHindenburg Research, which holds a short position in Nikola stock and stands to gain if the shares fall, released a report Thursday detailing what it called \u201cdozens of lies\u201d about the company\u2019s capabilities, partnerships or products. The firm used internal emails, analyzed photos and even cited an investigator dispatched to rural Utah to test how far a car would roll down a hill. Nikola said Hindenburg\u2019s report was full of falsehoods but hasn\u2019t offered anything specific to rebut the allegations.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take a hedge fund or a private eye to determine that Nikola, which struck a partnership this week with General Motors Co., has a pattern of discrepancies. A look at some of its announcements and filings, along with statements and tweets by Chairman Trevor Milton and other executives over the past few years, yields other examples that weren\u2019t part of Hindenburg\u2019s report. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit confusing trying to follow Trevor on his various social media outlets about the timing and cadence of communication of the different variables that you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Jeff Osborne, a Cowen &amp; Co. analyst, told executives on an Aug. 4 conference call.\n\nNikola\u2019s shares have tumbled 24% since the Hindenburg report, which, among other sources, cited a Bloomberg story from June about the company exaggerating the capabilities of a truck.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to doing our best to keep the investing public and all of our stakeholders informed and up to date at all times,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Mark Russell said Friday in an emailed response to questions from Bloomberg about the following items.\n\nUnder Construction\n\nAt a press event on July 22, ahead of the groundbreaking of Nikola\u2019s Coolidge, Arizona, factory, Head of Global Manufacturing Mark Duchesne fielded a question on when construction would get underway. \u201cThat one is an easy answer,\u201d he said. \u201cStart of construction is tomorrow.\u201d\n\nThe timeline was repeated by Milton the following day in a tweet. But \u201cconstruction\u201d turns out to be a broad term.\n\nTo facilitate the groundbreaking ceremony, the city of Coolidge issued Nikola a temporary use permit on July 13. The document, obtained by Bloomberg, allowed the company to do some limited ground clearing and preparation for holding the event, along with listing a plan for coronavirus safeguards. It didn\u2019t allow further construction to start beyond that. The company also obtained a Pinal County dust permit around the same time, a legal requirement in Arizona.\n\nOn Aug. 7, the company received its at-risk grading and drainage permit, City Manager Rick Miller said by phone. The permit allows Nikola to clear dirt and do drainage work on the site, but as yet the company doesn\u2019t have the permits required for foundation work, plumbing, electrical or vertical construction, Miller said. The permits are available through public-records requests.\n\nOn Wednesday, Nikola said in a tweet that Coolidge\u2019s city council had approved the company\u2019s \u201cfactory masterplan\u201d and that \u201cconstruction can now go forward.\u201d This is only partly true, Miller said. It was the planning and zoning commission that approved a \u201cmajor site plan.\u201d The approval will allow Nikola and its architects and engineers to apply for the next batch of permits.\n\nIn a statement, Nikola said that by \u201cconstruction\u201d it meant everything from groundbreaking to seeking permits. Now that its building plan is approved, \u201cthe various permits will be obtained in cadence with the steps of the construction. We remain on schedule for Phase 1,\u201d the company said in an email.\n\n\u201dThe factory will be up in 12 months,\u201d Milton said in a live broadcast on Instagram on Friday night. \u201cThe permit was just issued by the city. We are all good to go.\u201d\n\nPuzzling Partnership\n\nNikola has a stated ambition of manufacturing hydrogen-powered fuel cell semi trucks by 2023. Since 2017, it has had an agreement for German auto parts supplier Robert Bosch Gmbh to \u201cdevelop, build, test and support\u201d various components for Nikola\u2019s prototypes including a fuel-cell system, battery packs, steering pumps and motors, according to a regulatory filing in March.\n\nThe details of which partner is contributing what to the project has shifted over time, and the future of the deal has gotten hazier.\n\nNikola agreed to pay Bosch around $40 million for the development, according to the filing. In a presentation to investors in April, Nikola described the agreement with Bosch as a \u201cco-development\u201d and strategic supply chain partnership and said the company would jointly own any intellectual property developed with Bosch.\n\nHowever, Nikola executives have regularly stated that Nikola designed, developed and will provide much of the technology for its vehicles -- not Bosch. On Friday, Chief Financial Officer Kim Brady said that Nikola will provide only 15% of the parts in battery electric pickups due to be built in Ulm, Germany, while partner Iveco provides the rest. However, he added that Nikola\u2019s input represents 90% of the truck\u2019s value.\n\n\u201cWe are responsible for Nikola Tre -- the batteries, e-axle, e-motors, inverters, BMS system, infotainment system,\u201d Brady said. \u201cAll the key electric propulsion systems come from Nikola.\u201d\n\nAs recently as Aug. 25, Bosch has said that it\u2019s \u201cworking with the company to make the fuel-cell drive for trucks suitable for mass production.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Nikola announced that GM -- not Bosch -- will mass-supply a fuel cell system for Nikola\u2019s Class 7 and 8 semi trucks, as well as the battery packs for its debut electric pickup, the Badger. On Friday, Nikola clarified that Bosch will supply semi truck fuel cells in Europe, while GM will have exclusivity everywhere else.\n\n\u201cBosch is an investor, board member and supplier to Nikola. They help us in many facets of our business as our partner,\u201d Nikola said.\n\nMilton bristled at a claim by a Twitter user that Nikola was jilting Bosch in favor of GM.\n\n\u201cBosch as a company with a dedicated hydrogen strategy welcomes the decision of GM to enter this market as an important player,\u201d Bosch spokesman Tim Wieland said in an email. \u201cBeyond that, Nikola and Bosch have been working together for several years, not only on the fuel cell power train but also on other innovations like the steering system and the Mirror Cam System for the first prototypes of the Nikola trucks. The two companies will continue to cooperate in the future, also on fuel cells.\u201d\n\nGame Changer\n\nNikola\u2019s narrative about its battery strategy has also shifted over time.\n\nIn November 2019, Nikola issued a press release claiming to have \u201cgame-changing\u201d battery cell technology that it would unveil at an event in 2020. Nikola also said it had entered into a letter of intent to acquire a \u201cworld-class battery engineering team\u201d to help bring the new battery to pre-production.\n\n\u201cWe are talking about doubling the range of BEVs and hydrogen-electric vehicles around the world,\u201d Milton said in the statement.\n\nIn July, Milton tweeted that Nikola would \u201cmake the entire pack like the top guys do\u201d for its upcoming pickup truck, called the Badger. He said that all internal components, such as batteries, inverters, software and controls, are Nikola\u2019s own intellectual property. \u201cWe own it all in house,\u201d he said.\n\nMilton clarified in a tweet on Thursday that Nikola\u2019s change of direction -- to use GM\u2019s Ultium battery technology for the Badger -- was a result of cost analysis and cost savings.\n\nBeer Trucks\n\nBack in March, Nikola said in a presentation to investors that it has a \u201csigned binding agreement\u201d to provide Anheuser-Busch with as many as 800 hydrogen fuel cell electric semi trucks. What the presentation didn\u2019t say was that Anheuser-Busch committed to buy fewer trucks than that, and doesn\u2019t have to buy any at all.\n\nThe deal was first announced in May 2018 and stated the trucks were originally expected to be integrated into Anheuser-Busch\u2019s dedicated fleet by the end of 2020, according to a press release.\n\nThat timeline isn\u2019t going to be met. During the Aug. 4 earnings call, Russell, the CEO, updated investors on the deal, saying, \u201cWe do believe that we\u2019ll be able to give them test prototypes before the end of 2021; serial production or mass production of the fuel cell truck will not begin until 2023.\u201d\n\nThat does corroborate with the timeline for production set out in a July filing -- and to be fair, lots of people\u2019s plans have changed this year. But in the same filing, Nikola revealed that Anheuser-Busch retains the right to cancel the truck order, though there\u2019s no indication that will happen. The contract also has lease terms and rental rates that may be hard for Nikola to meet, according to the filing, \u201cdepending on our ability to develop our trucks and hydrogen network according to current design parameters and cost estimates.\u201d\n\nThe agreement between the two companies states that Anheuser-Busch gets priority of delivery for as much as 20% of Nikola\u2019s initial \u201cproduction line of Class 8 vehicles.\u201d To get production going by 2023, Nikola must work to have dedicated equipment in Anheuser Busch\u2019s breweries and distribution centers by the end of 2021, according to the deal terms. Anheuser-Busch only agreed to use at least 600 trucks -- the 800 figure, according to the document, is an estimate of what the brewer will need.\n\n\u201cThey have been, and continue to be, a great long-term partner in our shared vision of a zero-emission future (a Nikola Two prototype hauled our first load over public roads for them in St. Louis not too long ago),\u201d Russell said in the statement Friday, referring to Anheuser-Busch. \u201cOur original agreement with them has been modified over time. The current agreement terms are as we set forth in our earnings call.\u201d\n\nAnheuser-Busch didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. The partnership with Nikola will help the brewer transition its entire long-haul fleet to zero-emission vehicles, Anheuser-Busch said last November.\n\nPrototype Production\n\nOn July 13, Milton said European partner Iveco was already producing vehicle prototypes.\n\n\u201cWe have a truck coming in to production right now with 720KwH, the largest battery we know of anywhere in the world coming in to production,\u201d Milton said on the TC\u2019s Charcast Podcast. \u201cWe have five of them coming off the assembly line right now in Ulm, Germany.\u201d\n\nOn Aug. 4, during the company\u2019s debut earnings call, Russell echoed the sentiment, saying that the first five prototypes were \u201ccoming off the end of the facility at this point.\u201d\n\nThose statements were a mischaracterization of Nikola and Iveco\u2019s progress in Ulm, according to two people familiar with the matter. The assembly line is still under construction and not yet operational or building prototypes, the people said. There are prototypes being built by hand in a workshop, one of the people said.\n\n\u201cAs stated previously, the first five production prototypes of the Nikola Tre are being completed, by an assembly team at the Ulm facility. Also as stated previously, the Nikola/IVECO JV mass production line facility in Ulm is still under construction, and is on track for the start of regular serial production in 2021,\u201d Russell said Friday. \u201cWe anticipate that a number of current IVECO personnel will join the Nikola/IVECO JV production team in Ulm.\u201d\n\nNikola\u2019s Guidance\n\nHere\u2019s when Nikola has said it will hit its big milestones, based on filings, statements and interviews: [ ]\n\nhttps://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/nikola-s-history-of-discrepancies-has-been-hiding-in-plain-sight-1.1492855",

My Discover Bank was offering a balance transfer of up to my credit limit which is $19,400 at a 3% fee and no interest until 12 months has passed and the balance hasn\u2019t been re-payed. I took out a $5,000 loan with an upfront fee of $150 or 3%. I plan on investing this money into Apple, Tesla and QQQ with hopes that the return at the very least is 4% on that $5,000 to break even on the loan after IRS takes their taxes on those gains within the following year. I anticipate getting much more than 4% return on that $5,000 within a year which will effectively net me a profit. I\u2019m new to investing and I believe this action is called investing on margin. I chose a $5,000 loan, because the monthly amount to pay it back within a year fits in my budget and I can stomach losing that much money as opposed to going all out with my $19,400 credit limit in which I can\u2019t afford to lose that.

The faltering labor market recovery and a recent rise in new coronavirus infections has piled pressure on Congress and the White House to come up with another rescue package.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Wednesday that Congress and the U.S. central bank needed to \u201cstay with it\u201d in working to support the economy\u2019s recovery.

        "selftext": "Snowflake (SNOW) will go public today. The data warehousing company will be the biggest IPO of the year and it has gotten a lot of attention lately. Salesforce and even Berkshire Hathaway will both be buying 3.1 million stocks, good for $500,000,000 in total. They got to buy them for $80 per share.\n\nThis week, the company's underwriters have upped the price range from $75-$85 to $100-$110, which is an increase of 31% due to greater demand. They then decided that this was still not good enough so the stock will go public at $120 per share.\n\nCan this be justified? Maybe. Their revenue increased with 130% in the first half of the year yoy. They're on track to bring in $500 mln in revenue this year. We all know that investors get really excited by cloud companies and pay a hefty premium for them, because they keep generating revenue during lockdowns and high growth rates are expected to continue over the coming years.\n\nNow, here's the quote we've all been waiting for:\n\n\"For the investor, a too-high purchase price for the stock of an excellent company can undo the effects of a subsequent decade of favorable business developments.\"\n\nThe irony is that Buffet himself is involved in this highly priced IPO. Yes, we all know that the company will probably do great over the next few years. The data warehousing industry will have a size of around $35 bln in 2025. That's just a little bigger than the current market cap of Snowflake($33.3 bln). Last February, they were only valued at $12.7 bln, and with a P/S ratio of 50, the stock is more expensive than Zoom. What you really should be asking yourself is: how much of their expected growth is already priced in? Are you willing to pay 50% more than that institutional parties had to?\n\nI'm not saying whether to buy in or not, I just wanted to give this piece of advice by the Oracle to you.

The Badger will use GM\u2019s widely acclaimed Ultium battery technology. Additionally, Nikola will hand over $2 billion in stock to GM \u2014 giving the automaker an 11% stake in the company.\n\n\u201cNikola is one of the most innovative companies in the world. General Motors is one of the top engineering and manufacturing companies in the world. You couldn\u2019t dream of a better partnership than this,\u201d said Nikola founder and executive chairman Trevor Milton in a statement. \u201cBy joining together, we get access to their validated parts for all of our programs, General Motors\u2019 Ultium battery technology and a multi-billion dollar fuel cell program ready for production. Nikola immediately gets decades of supplier and manufacturing knowledge, validated and tested production-ready EV propulsion, world-class engineering and investor confidence. Most importantly, General Motors has a vested interest to see Nikola succeed. We made three promises to our stakeholders and have now fulfilled two out of three promises ahead of schedule. What an exciting announcement.\u201d \n\nAdded GM Chairman and CEO Mary Barra, \u201cThis strategic partnership with Nikola, an industry leading disrupter, continues the broader deployment of General Motors\u2019 all-new Ultium battery and Hydrotec fuel cell systems. \u201cWe are growing our presence in multiple high-volume EV segments while building scale to lower battery and fuel cell costs and increase profitability. In addition, applying General Motors\u2019 electrified technology solutions to the heavy-duty class of commercial vehicles is another important step in fulfilling our vision of a zero-emissions future.\u201d\n\nThus far, the Badger has been a mere rendering that has lit-up social media feeds.\n\nThe company did begin taking pre-orders for the electric super pickup truck in late June. On paper, the truck stands to be a beast. It\u2019s expected to have 906 horsepower and have a 600-mile range using both battery and hydrogen fuel cells. Nikola has said pricing will start at $60,000 for the electric vehicle version and $90,000 for the one that also includes the hydrogen cell.\n\nThe Badger is expected to be unveiled in early December. Production has been set for 2022.",

So being a 22 year old, impulsive, and irresponsible I bought 100 shares for something like 305 with trading fee. I checked it for a few weeks regularly, nothing happens and I essentially forgot about it. I was discouraged that it didn\u2019t explode to the moon right away and I didn\u2019t do anything. I was very busy with work and school at the time and somehow I forgot that $300 dollars of mine was sitting in ameritrade  flash forward to roughly 2 years later or so and my phone updates the ameritrade app. I\u2019m like \u201cwait don\u2019t I have money on here?\u201d  I recover my password and username and log in to see it\u2019s worth roughly 16 a share. I\u2019m like \u201choly fuck I got like 1300 in here\u201d. So now I\u2019m hyped and checking it every day. One day it drops to 12 dollars and I panic and sell it all and felt like like wolf of Wall Street.

There are already 20 trucks operating with Hyliion\u2019s electric powertrains, built via ventures with Dana Corp. and Volvo. Tesla said this year it was delaying production of its Semi until 2021. Shares in Nikola meanwhile have collapsed from the $70s to less than $20 amid fraud allegations and the departure of Milton.\n\nAlso:\n\n&gt; Healy\u2019s e-axle evolved into a complete drivetrain system that Hyliion calls the Hypertruck ERX. Replacing the diesel engine is a bank of electric batteries, which are charged via onboard generators that run on tanks of compressed natural gas. Healy\u2019s approach contrasts with the field\u2019s first movers, including Tesla and its all-electric, battery-centric approach, as well as Nikola, which aims to power its batteries using hydrogen fuel cells.\n\nAnd:\n\n&gt; Automotive parts giant Dana Inc. in March 2019 made an equity investment into Hyliion, and together they are manufacturing and marketing the device to Dana\u2019s slate of customers, including truck giants Volvo, Navistar and Peterbilt. Today truck makers install engines from Cummins and transmissions from Allison. Hyliion hopes to someday join that echelon. First large deliveries of the Hypertruck ERX could come in 2021.",

        "selftext": "***\u2018A large market correction, should one materialise, would encourage more professional selling that could overwhelm the buy-the-dip retail investor.\u2019***\n\nThat\u2019s **Mohamed El-Erian, Allianz\u2019s chief economic adviser**, explaining in [an op-ed for the Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/e50812f0-51c1-4f8c-9072-21eb0eb8cb9d) how action in the options pits should be taken as a warning by retail investors who have been cashing in on the stock market\u2019s relentless push higher in recent months.\n\n\u201cThe seemingly endless rally\u2026 gives the impression that prices are endorsed and supported by the entire professional investment community,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter all, despite the vocal concerns over valuations having split away from underlying corporate and economic fundamentals, few fund managers have been willing to challenge the market by placing outright shorts. \u201c\n\nHowever, \u201csophisticated investors\u201d are expressing their cautious views with the use of derivatives, and El-Erian says the mom-and-pop types should take note.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to overstate the extent of today\u2019s risk-taking in U.S. financial markets,\u201d he wrote, pointing to the explosive moves in a small number of high-flyers, such as Apple [**AAPL,** **+3.98%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/AAPL?mod=MW_story_quote), Tesla [**TSLA,** **-4.67%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/TSLA?mod=MW_story_quote) and Amazon [**AMZN,** **+1.39%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/AMZN?mod=MW_story_quote).\n\n\u201cMuch of this could be seen as market deepening were it not for one troubling fact: corporate and economic fundamentals have yet to reflect a sustained and convincing recovery from COVID-related damage,\u201d he said. The rebound in consumption is slowing, initial jobless claims are back to the 1 million level for a second straight week, bankruptcies are rising, and, according to El-Erian, it\u2019s looking like these short-term disruptions are about to become long-term scars.\n\n\u201cRather than a well-thought-out bet on the future, stocks reflect many investors\u2019 resolute faith in a consistently favourable and predictable liquidity environment,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is a backdrop anchored by reliable stimulus from central banks.\u201d\n\nOn the surface, the same can pretty much be said for what we\u2019re seeing in the derivatives market, but there\u2019s more to it than just that.\n\n\u201cThe fear of missing out on an unceasing equity rally has increasingly been expressed through call options,\u201d El-Erian said. \u201cThose who would normally short the market on concerns of excessive valuations appear to have no desire to be steamrollered once again by favourable liquidity and the strong \u2018buy-the-dip\u2019 conditioning that comes with that.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that buying call options limits risk and gives traders the ability to take strategic shots at capturing rallies. At the same time, the smart money is hedging bets with downside \u201ctail protection\u201d to guard against the inevitable sharp declines. That\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing the VIX volatility gauge [**VIX,** **-1.09%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/VIX?mod=MW_story_quote) decouple from equities, another sign, according to El-Erian, that retail investors are particularly vulnerable when the sellers take the upper hand.\n\nRead More:   [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-pros-are-getting-ready-for-a-market-crash-retail-investors-not-so-much-top-economist-warns-11598970447](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-pros-are-getting-ready-for-a-market-crash-retail-investors-not-so-much-top-economist-warns-11598970447)",

        "selftext": "You know all that nonsense from the Fed about average inflation and how they'll plan to let the economy run soooo hot that they break through the 2% target they never, ever achieved?\n\nWell guess what, there's no fucking way that happens, and the dollar index pump we're seeing right now reflects that. I think a lot of people here think that if the Fed prints money, more money = inflation. But actually that only happens when the average person has more money and increases their spending. But what's happened is that 100% of the money they print gets tied up in the banking system and never spent. This is the same reason there hasn't been significantly inflation in a decade: income inequality. And covid has only made that worse, which is why what we're up against is actually deflation.\n\nAnd why is deflation so shitty? Lower prices are awesome, right? Well, the reason inflation is so great for the US equities market is because (1) equities are inflation neutral and (2) companies are in shitloads of debt. Deflation makes the enormous debt bubble impossible to pay off. (In reality the relationship between the dollar and stocks is pretty complex, which is why you retards are only getting the ELI5.)\n\nIn short, the Fed's move is the same as saying \"we will no longer tax income over $5T.\" It sounds nice, but it doesn't fucking apply.

        "selftext": "\\&gt;Listen up retards, I want you to start making legitimate low risk guaranteed returns. This strategy if done correctly is actually the most profitable theta strategy, and the only one that can generate more then 70% if your investment consistently every month.    \n\n\\&gt;Quick Steps on how to do it and the TLDR is at the end, although i recommend reading through my explanation    \n\n\\&gt;Ok if you\u2019re still reading we\u2019ll need to establish a few things. A covered call is when you own 100 shares of a stock, and you sell a call against your position.     \n\n\\&gt;So basically if I own 100 shares of spy right now, I can sell a call at 335 giving the right to the buyer of the call to buy my 100 shares at 335 each, in exchange they will give me a premium to have that right, and hence I make money. This strategy works when you\u2019re expecting the stock to be bearish or flat. However, if the call exercises when it is ITM, you will be forced to sell 100 shares of spy at 335 no matter what the price is.    \n\n\\&gt;Now a poor man's covered call uses the same strategy, however using a different collateral. You see, when you buy a call, you are buying the right to buy 100 shares of the underlying at an agreed upon price. Therefore lets take this example, I buy a 335 call on spy, if I exercise it, I can buy a 100 shares of spy for 335 each. Now this right gives us incredible leverage, because we are able to do this, at the same time we can sell another call, such a 335 call. Now if the 335 call we sold is ITM and we are forced to exercise, then we exercise the call we bought, buy 100 shares for 335, and sell it to the other guy for 335, then we\u2019re released from all of its obligation. This also applies to call you sell that are at a higher strike price then the one you\u2019re holding, see if you\u2019re forced to exercise, you\u2019ll make the difference in intrinsic value back as profit. Such as selling a call at the 336 strike price, if you\u2019re forced to exercise then you\u2019ll actually make a 100$.     \n\n\\&gt;Ok you\u2019re with me so far? We have one more strategy to talk about, the diagonal spread. The diagonal spread is a strategy where you buy a long dated call say four months out, and sell another call at a higher strike price and shorter strike price. That way you make money from the premium of the short strike call, while simultaneously making money on the long dated call we bought.     \n\n\\&gt;So this strategy employs these two strategies together on SPY. So let's get started to how you would set this up. First of all, you\u2019ll go to SPY, and look at the current price. Currently Spy closed at 333.91, so we will use this value for our calculations. Now the usual way to find the best long dated option to buy, is to find one that is very close to being OTM or even a dollar or two ITM. The best date is 4 months plus, because you'll have around two months of negligible theta.      \n\n\\&gt;An important point here, the further out the better as the less theta, the more money this will generate long term. In addition, the more ITM the call is the better because it gives you more leeway, I\u2019ll explain how to use this to your advantage later.    \n\n\\&gt;So in our case, the best call to buy, is the 333c Jan 15 2021 for 1943$. Now you buy this, and you\u2019re a proud owner of this call, now it\u2019s time to start selling a call against it. The closest next expiry date is sep 14. Now the 336c call is looking pretty spicey with it\u2019s 123$ premium, so we sell it.    \n\n\\&gt;Now a very simple plug in of the call you sold into a \\[profit calculator\\]([https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/)) we see that for this call to remain over the 123$ worth spy will have to open at 337.50 or higher which is more then 4$ increase, which isn\u2019t always likely. Now let\u2019s go over the few scenarios that might occur:    \n\n\\&gt;&gt;\\* spy opens below 337.50, in which case the call will lose its value. As long as spy doesn\u2019t close above 336, then you get to keep the premium, and if spy hovers around the current price and up to 334, the call becomes worth less then 20$, which means you can buy it back and get to keep the 100$ + difference    \n\n\\&gt;&gt;\\*Spy moons 9 points to 342 in one day. To close the call it would cost you 553$ as it would be worth 675. However, keep in mind that our long dated call is now worth 2397. Therefore, if we closed both options we will be at a total loss of 50$. This happens due to gamma of the short call being higher, due to it's shorter expiry date. If you had cash, you can buy back that call you sold, and lose 553 cash on hand, and be 50$ negative on your entire portfolio. Then you can turn around and sell more calls    \n\n\\&gt;&gt;\\*Spy has a retarded correction, or even god forbid a crash. In which case your long dated call will rapidly lose value and if spy loses more then 15% of its value, such as below 280$ then you lose 85% of the value of the spread. On the other a correction of 10%, would make the spread lose 65% of its value    \n\n\\&gt;&gt;It\u2019s very important to remember, the type of equity that spy represents, which is the entire US market. For context, in the last 5 years, spy has only had 7 instances of a correction over 10% which can result in a heavy loss with this strategy. Now let\u2019s look at the possible actions to take in every scenario.    \n\n\\&gt;&gt;\\*If the call has lost more then 80% of its value, or really any amount where your profits are over 120, them buy it back and close it.    \n\n\\&gt;&gt;\\*If the call becomes ITM and you\u2019re forced to close it, then look at your options(no pun intended)    \n\n\\&gt;&gt;&gt;\\*If you have enough cash to close it, and you don\u2019t have any possible use for that available cash within the next two weeks then close it.     \n\n\\&gt;&gt;&gt;\\*If you don\u2019t have enough money to close the call or you\u2019re not willing to lose that available cash, then simply close both options with either a profit or a loss depending on how had spy mooned that day.        \n\n\\&gt;Now after you\u2019ve done this once, let\u2019s say you were successful and the call you sold was worth less and you made premium back. Now you have more cash on hand, and you\u2019ve made money. Keep in mind, this also means more leeway, in case the next trade you might have to close the short call at a loss, either available cash loss, or net loss.     \n\n\\&gt;Doing the math on possible profits. In a single month, you are able to sell 12 spy calls. If a spy remains flat, or has a slow upwards trend, and says on average you sell your calls at a profit of 100$, then you can make 1200$ from the spy, on a 2000$ investment. Every month, until expiry on the long call. If spy rises, then your initial call would also increase in value, resulting in extra profits when you eventually close it.     \n\n\\&gt;\\_\\_NOW COMPARE THIS TO THE WHEEL STRATEGY\\_\\_ you would need a minimum of 33,000$ in order to buy a 100 shares of spy. Now first of all, the upfront collateral is ridiculous, and not many can afford it. If you\u2019re asking yourself, well why can\u2019t I use a cheaper stock, remember that only a spy has 12 contracts per month, every other etf and stock only has 4 per month. Furthermore, due to the sheer volume of spy, it's more reliable in terms of premiums.    \n\n\\&gt;Here\u2019s the best part too, spy increasing in value won\u2019t benefit you with the wheel strategy, as you\u2019re forced to sell your shares at the strike price of the short call. On the other hand, let\u2019s compare the potential losses with this strategy, If spy were to lose 10% of value down to 300, then you\u2019ll lose 3000$ vs only 1600$ with our long call. In addition, if spy keeps losing value you\u2019ll keep losing money, while your gains are capped with the long call.     \n\n\\&gt;Thereby the obvious advantages of this strategy:    \n\n\\&gt;&gt;\\*We profit from spy\u2019s increase of value and its flatness        \n\n\\&gt;&gt;\\*Our maximum losses are capped, and the more successful calls we sell the less our risk becomes.        \n\n\\&gt;&gt;\\*Our total needed collateral is a fraction of spy, at usually around 6%. Keep in mind that the same call, 333c at an expiration of sep 17 2021, a leap year call, is only 3000$, which is still only 9% of the value we\u2019d usually need.     \n\n\\&gt;And the best part, is how scalable this is, at an average of 100$ per contract sold profits, we can make back out entire about a month and a half, and we can buy another long contract. This way, spending 4000$, for an average return of 200$ per contract. This is ofcourse not counting our long dated calls increasing value with spy.     \n\n\\&gt;This is to make your mouth water at the possible tendies. A 10,000$ investment, which is 5 contracts, can generate 6000$ per month on average, or even higher depending on market conditions. Keep in mind, the same amount of money, the 33,000 needed to use the wheel strategy, can generate 20,000 a month, vs the regular 1200 it can generate.    \n\n\\&gt;Keep in mind, this only works if spy is in an flat and positive trend. To put things into perspective, it takes 1.5 months to generate enough money to buy a second contract.  Now that you\u2019d be making double the money, that means you\u2019ll need half the time, to get the second contract, and because we\u2019re buying the contract at a higher strike price for the same price of around 2000, we keep covering higher and higher values of spy. So the second contract takes 1.5 months, the second would take three weeks, the third would take a week and half, the fourth would take 2 option dates, and them you\u2019ll be making enough money to buy another call, every weekly option.    \n\n\\&gt;I\u2019ll make a part 2 about how to take this strategy further if you are successful to layer calls upon calls, virtually building a tranche that becomes very profitable.     \n\n\\&gt;So I hope you employ this strategy to start making real money, and generating actual returns that are consistent, while still basking in the glory of theta gang, without needing the ridiculous amount of collateral\n\n\\&gt;TLDR : For the absolute retards who don't want to read but instead want to know positions: you\u2019ll need around 2000 - 2500 $ to employ this strategy correctly        \n\n\\&gt;&gt;\\*Buy long dated spy call, 4+ months out such as 335c Spy Jan 15 2021     \n\n\\&gt;&gt;\\*Then sell calls on weekly spy, 3-5$ OTM     \n\n\\&gt;&gt;\\*If the call you sold becomes ITM, buy it back with the cash on hand, if you can't, close both positions, and re-enter your long position at a higher strike price\n\n\\&gt;&gt;\\*If not, buy the call back on the expiration day when it's lost 80% + of its value    \n\n\\&gt;&gt;\\*Rinse and repeat    \n\n\\&gt;&gt;\\*You\u2019ll only be able to sell calls in this scenario, of 335c or higher, therefore if a spy's value drops where the 335c becomes worthless to sell, in this case if its value is less than a 100. Then exit your long dated call, and buy another one at spy\u2019s current level",

        "selftext": " We might be in a bubble. We\u2019re not at the later stages yet, but we\u2019re getting there. Here\u2019s a quick refresh on the 5 stages of a bubble and where I think we are in the stages.\n\n**1. Displacement**\n\n**A displacement occurs when investors get enamored by a new paradigm, such as an innovative new technology or interest rates that are historically low. A classic example of displacement is the decline in the federal funds rate from 6.5% in July 2000, to 1.2% in June 2003. Over this three-year period, the interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell by 2.5 percentage points to a historic low of 5.23%, sowing the seeds for the subsequent housing bubble.**\n\nIn our case the displacement is the Coronavirus pandemic. It has completely shifted how we think about--and value--technology stocks. Everyone is talking about the \u201cpost COVID world\u201d and how that has upended tech companies.\n\n**2. Boom**\n\n**Prices rise slowly at first, following a displacement, but then gain momentum as more and more participants enter the market, setting the stage for the boom phase. During this phase, the asset in question attracts widespread media coverage. Fear of missing out on what could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity spurs more speculation, drawing an increasing number of investors and traders into the fold.**\n\nWe\u2019ve already seen record numbers of retail investors joining the ranks. Everyone is stuck at home with nothing else to do and a bit of extra money from the stimulus, so they are deciding to learn how to ~~gamble~~ invest.\n\n**3. Euphoria**\n\n**During this phase, caution is thrown to the wind, as asset prices skyrocket. Valuations reach extreme levels during this phase as new valuation measures and metrics are touted to justify the relentless rise, and the \"greater fool\" theory\u2014the idea that no matter how prices go, there will always be a market of buyers willing to pay more\u2014plays out everywhere. For example, at the peak of the Japanese real estate bubble in 1989, land in Tokyo sold for as much as $139,000 per square foot or more than 350 times the value of Manhattan property.\ufeff Similarly, at the height of the internet bubble in March 2000, the combined value of all technology stocks on the Nasdaq was higher than the GDP of most nations.**\n\nIMO, we\u2019re in the early to mid stages of euphoria. Asset prices aren\u2019t skyrocketing, but they\u2019re increasing rapidly. It\u2019s not insane yet, but we\u2019re getting there. \n\n**4. Profit-Taking**\n\n**In this phase, the smart money\u2014heeding the warning signs that the bubble is about at its bursting point\u2014starts selling positions and taking profits. But estimating the exact time when a bubble is due to collapse can be a difficult exercise because, as economist John Maynard Keynes put it, \"the markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.\" In August 2007, for example, French bank BNP Paribas halted withdrawals from three investment funds with substantial exposure to U.S. subprime mortgages because it could not value their holdings.**\n\n\ufeff **While this development initially rattled financial markets, it was brushed aside over the next couple months, as global equity markets reached new highs. In retrospect, Paribas had the right idea, and this relatively minor event was indeed a warning sign of the turbulent times to come.**\n\nThis could be us if we\u2019re smart about it. Now, obviously we can\u2019t time the market perfectly. But we can play the odds and start hedging our bets when we get to a point where it seems likely that we\u2019re in a bubble. In the meantime we can still ride it out for a bit more gains. \n\n**5. Panic**\n\n**It only takes a relatively minor event to prick a bubble, but once it is pricked, the bubble cannot inflate again. In the panic stage, asset prices reverse course and descend as rapidly as they had ascended. Investors and speculators, faced with margin calls and plunging values of their holdings, now want to liquidate at any price. As supply overwhelms demand, asset prices slide sharply. One of the most vivid examples of global panic in financial markets occurred in October 2008, weeks after Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy and Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and AIG almost collapsed. The S&amp;P 500 plunged almost 17% that month, its ninth-worst monthly performance.  In that single month, global equity markets lost a staggering $9.3 trillion of 22% of their combined market capitalization.**\n\nDon\u2019t let this be you, but if it is, just sit tight and buy once prices drop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Finally**, a good warning sign that the market is entering bubble territory is the widespread use of the following expressions by supposed experts:\n\n* \u201cOur only problems are the problems of success\u201d\n* \u201cPrices have adjusted to a new paradigm in which higher valuations will be the norm\u201d\n* \u201cGlobalization/communications technology/freer trade/wealthy investors from some part of the world you\u2019ve never heard of justify these higher prices\u201d\n* And, of course, \u201cthis time, it\u2019s different\u201d.\n\nIt won\u2019t be.\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n* Watch out for these warning signs\n* When we start seeing mass hysteria and even more inflated prices, start hedging your bets with shorts or put options\n\nLet me know your thoughts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*much of the information about the stages of bubbles was taken  from an Investopedia article.

        "selftext": "Take advantage of the EV goldrush by completing the EV Trifecta\n\nAs you may already know, we are currently in the midst of an EV goldrush. Early adopters, investors, and gamblers will be rewarded for identifying these opportunities and capitalizing on them. \n\nOne way to ensure that you gain enough exposure to capitalize on this this gold rush is by completing the EV Trifecta, which are:\n\n1. EV Manufacturers \n2. Raw materials for batteries\n3. EV charging stations\n\nI will go into a bit more detail on each component of the trifecta:\n\n \n\n1. EV Manufacturers - These are companies that develop and manufacturer EV for the public to new purchase. There is a lot of EV manufacturers that are going public, some of them will be achieve market dominance, while others will dwindle away \\*cough\\* NKLA. These are some of the EV manufacturers that are available for the public to invest in: TSLA, NIO, XPEV, KNDI, LI, SHLL, PIC, HCA(C), SPA(Q). Currently, TSLA is the market leader in this industry and also have the first mover advantage, and this is clearly reflected in their stock price. All the other EV manufacturers are up and coming and will have lots of run room as EVs become more prevalent in our day to day lives.\n\n2. Raw materials for batteries - The logic here is that as demand for EV increase, so will the demand for the raw materials used to create the batteries for the EVs. Simple economics 101 states that as demand increase and supply decreases, price should increase accordingly. These are the current raw materials companies that have a spotlight on them: LA(C), VAL(E), PLL. PLL is the only raw materials company that have a public contract with TSLA and has been halted for weeks because of this news. PLL will definitely be a hot buy once it unhalts. \n\n3. EV charging stations - In order for EVs to be come more prominent in our day to day lives, there needs to be a proper infrastructure that will enable that. One of the biggest concerns in regards to EV is range anxiety - drivers don't want to be left stranded if they forget to charge their vehicles overnight at home. Having charging stations that are widely available will help combat this risk. The EV charging station market is relatively untapped, and this market will grow along side the EV market. The key players in the EV Charging station are SBE, BLNK, SPl. SPl had an insane run up last week when they announced their EV initiative, their share price increased over 3000% from $1.50 to over $40 (this was short lived though). BLNK is a mixed bag, there are some complaints in regards to the quality of their charging stations, but hopefully they'll improve over time. SBE is a SPA(C) merger to bring Chargepoint public. Similar to TSLA, Chargepoint is the market leader in the charging station space and also have the first mover advantage. Chargepoint currently has hundred of thousands of charging stations across North America (US and Canada) and is expanding into Europe. Their products can be purchased via their home website or Amazon and have great reviews online. \n\nBy completing the EV Trifecta you'll ensure you have proper exposure to the EV goldrush. I'm sure I missed a few companies, so please feel free to mention them and add any additional details that I might have missed.",

        "selftext": "**BULLS:**\n\n**Oppenheimer: \"Doing More With Less.**\u00a0TSLA outlined a robust reimagining of battery design, manufacturing, and performance including targeting a $25K vehicle in three years and 20x capacity increase by 2030. It is ramping a pilot line featuring a comprehensive redesign of product architecture, basic materials, and process technology and expects to yield \\~56% cost declines, 54% range improvement, and 69% capex reduction, with initial benefits seen over 12\u201318 months, achieviing run-rate at \\~three years. TSLA reiterated 30\u201340% delivery growth in 2020 (implied 478\u2013515K) ahead of consensus estimates. We are impressed with the ambition of the endeavor and believe this roadmap charts ongoing technology and cost leadership for TSLA enabling sales into the entire LDV market. While limited details may weigh on shares, we would be buyers on any near-tearm weakness.\"\n\n**ON THE FENCE:**\n\n**Morgan Stanley: \"A Call to Arms.** Tesla\u2019s battery day largely lived up to the hype, but didn\u2019t clearly exceed it. We think the main narrative is that Tesla\u2019s battery tech is outpacing current growth in supply\u2026 and it's time to spend significantly.\"\n\n**Credit Suisse: \"Battery Day plan shows elevated growth narrative ahead, but consider challenges in manufacturing ramp.**\u00a0Tesla\u2019s much anticipated Battery Day brought several key positives: 1. Battery plans to support aggressive growth over next decade; 2. Growth unlocked via cost reductions on multiple fronts, highlighted by ambitious vertical integration plans; 3. Yet another reminder Tesla is well ahead of other automakers in the push to EV. However, the biggest driver of Tesla\u2019s success in its strategy will be its ability to successfully ramp manufacturing, and we expect challenges along the way. Amid lofty expectations into the event, we see a \u2018sell the news\u2019 reaction on the stock given Tesla is still 3 years away from its planned $25,000 vehicle and full benefits from its battery strategy. That said, we ultimately expect weakness to be bought as the event highlighted Tesla\u2019s robust growth narrative.\"\n\n**Canaccord Genuity: \"Battery Day hits on manufacturing strategies, but may disappoint for those that see a tech juggernaut.**\u00a0As expected, Tesla\u2019s Battery Day and shareholder meeting provided a trove of clues as to the direction of the company. For Bulls, the operational and systems approach to reduce manufacturing costs for autos and energy might be enough to warrant momentum. Bears, however, are likely to point the shift towards what looks increasingly like a modern day auto OEM than a tech company.\"\n\n**Goldman: \"Capacity, Battery Tech and Cost in focus.**\u00a0Tesla believes that it will see the initial impact of these changes within 12-18 months, and the full impact in about 3 years. In addition, Tesla stated that it could release a $25,000 car in about 3 years as a result of the reduction in pack cost. We believe that a vehicle at this price point (coupled with Tesla's other products) would help Tesla to address a wide range of the light vehicle market (and furthermore EVs offer savings for the typical US driver in the form of lower maintenance and fuel costs that we have previously estimated are about $800 per year vs. an ICE vehicle). We expect the ability and timing for Tesla to fully achieve these targets to be one investor debate post the event, as Tesla has not always met its past targets. While we are incrementally positive on long-term EV adoption, we believe that the company's premium multiple (Exhibit 4 and Exhibit 5) currently reflects this.\"\n\n**BEARS:**\n\n\\*\\*Barclays: \"\\*\\*while it had the usual set of aggressive forward-looking targets, the key question of the stock is whether a more subdued Musk \u2013 who uncharacteristically cautioned that the battery innovations were \u2018close to working\u2019 \u2013 is enough to sustain the valuation. We can see a few days of \u2018sell the news,\u2019 especially as Musk did not forecast either the 1 million mile battery (which many Tesla fans expected) or using Tesla cars for vehicle to gird (which we expected), and the \u2018one more thing\u2019 was delayed Model S Plaid performance variant. Moreover, the Plaid variant was delayed. After that, however, attention will shift to delivery forecasts for 3Q20, where Musk was silent other than forecasting 30-40% unit growth for 2020.\"\n\n**Needham: \"Will Vertical Integration Make or Break Tesla? We Have 3 Years to Find Out.** At its well-hyped Battery Day yesterday, TSLA announced its transformational plans to more than halve the cost per $/KWH of its batteries through the strategy of vertical integration. The ultimate goal is to increase range by 54%, while cutting cost/KWh by 56% and investment per GWh by 69% in five steps: cell design, cell factory, anode materials, cathode materials and cell vehicle integration (outlined below). This plan will take three years to be fully implemented. While we applaud the company's ambitious plans, we believe it is an inherently risky move with steep execution and operational challenges.\"",

After the coronavirus market tumult hit those bets hard, the company established an asset management unit for public investments using capital contributed by its founder Masayoshi Son.\n\nNow it has also made a splash in trading derivatives linked to some of those new investments, which has shocked market veterans. \u201cThese are some of the biggest trades I\u2019ve seen in 20 years of doing this,\u201d said one derivatives-focused US hedge fund manager. \u201cThe flow is huge.\u201d\n\nThe surge in purchases of call options \u2014 derivatives that give the user the right to buy a stock at a pre-agreed price \u2014 has been the talk of Wall Street in recent weeks, as the sheer size of the trades appears to have exacerbated a \u201cmelt-up\u201d in many big technology stocks over the summer. Shares in Tesla soared 26 per cent in under a week to September 1, while Amazon and Google parent Alphabet gained about 9 per cent.\n\nOne person familiar with SoftBank\u2019s trades said it was \u201cgobbling up\u201d options on a scale that was even making some people within the organisation nervous. \u201cPeople are caught with their pants down, massively short. This can continue. The whale is still hungry.\u201d\n\nThe options boom means that the US stock market remains vulnerable to further bursts of volatility, according to Charlie McElligott, a strategist at Nomura. \u201cThe street is still very much in a dangerous space, and that flow is still out there,\u201d he said in a note on Friday, adding that this leaves the market open to swings higher or lower.\n\nThe overall nominal value of calls traded on individual US stocks has averaged $335bn a day over the past two weeks, according to Goldman Sachs. That is more than triple the rolling average in 2017 to 2019. The retail trading boom has played a big part of the frenzy, but investors say the size of many recent option purchases are far too big to be retail-driven.",

        "selftext": "I just finished reading '*The Intelligent Investor*' from Benjamin Graham. Afterwards, I tried my best to put Graham's advice into practice and analysed my portfolio thoroughly. As a sidenote, my portfolio was all US stocks (50% NASDAQ-100 and 50% single tech stocks as AMD, NVID, AMZN, ...). I looked at the balance sheets of the respective companies for the first time, with Graham's words in the back of my mind. After 2 days of analysis, I decided that none of my holdings is worth to hold at its current price. Sure, all of them are really good companies with great future prospects, but they are simply way too overpriced.\n\nOne sentences from Graham sticked to my mind the most:\n\n**The intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists.**\n\nThat sentence really hit me. It reminded me of the unrealistic optimism among todays \"investors\" that is most embodied in meme sentences like \"stonks only go up\", \"buy the dip\", and so on and so forth. It really made me realize that this whole game is really just nothing but a game anymore, pure speculation from people relying on the FED to keep their gains growing for another couple of month, before eventually everything has to fall apart.\n\nI think selling my positions was the right move as the market seems to be unsustainable and flooded by optimists these days. I know, timing the market is not Graham's advice either, but he certainly does not recommend a \"never sell anything and always try to buy the dip after a 5% correction\" strategy that most people promote on reddit these days. I feel smart and reliefed after selling to optimists.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Did I made a foolish move based on outdated knowledge? Will I get the opportunity to buy from pessimists in the next two years?",

        "selftext": "I'm so fucking disappointed in myself. I was recovering, finally recovering some of my lost money. I lost a shit ton on SPY puts in March. I was retardedly bearish during the entire recovery and flipped a few weeks ago. Finally started seeing some green and was getting back to where I was in before March. And then the market tanked again and I was expecting at least modest green today recovering from the dramatic drop. Of course I was wrong and lost $7k. I'm just always late on the trend and overconfident. I can't imagine how I recover from this aside from years of saving and just never touching options again. You know, maybe that's just the way to go. There is no guaranteed get-rich-quick scheme. Please help me, and thanks in advance for anything you guys have to offer. Also fuck you and fuck me for trying to buy the dip without any sign of momentum change. And fuck SPY for continuing to drop after hours. I've been bag holding SPY $347c 9/11 NFLX $530c 9/11 and NVDA $495c 9/11. Should I just sell tomorrow and walk out with the $2k I'll have left?  \n\nAt least it was money I could afford to lose and I'm still young, but damn...

We are in full on hype mode where anyone who holds the stock thinks that we are im a massive paradigm shift and that prices will only rise.  If you are able to separate yourself from the emotions of your wins, you'll see that a nearly 6x gain in 6 months is not sustainable.  \n\nThere has been no insane breakthroughs and nothing that fundamentally changed the future of the company. Some will say that \"People are adequately evaluating its potential now\".  Thats not a fundamental shift to its potential earnings, its just a shift to perceived value.  That is exactly what drove a specific digital coins rise too back in 2017... perceived value and hype.\n\nYes. Tesla is amazing. Elon musk is a visionary. They have incredible engineers and are more of a tech company than a car company. All of that is true. It is a fantastic company.\n\nAnd ya, one day i might actually earn its spot as the 7th largest market cap in the United States. But theres a whole lot that needs to go right between now and then.  Its priced for its 2025 or even its 2030 value.\n\nThis will absolutely dip and people who buy now will lose most of their money. It might be 1 month, it might be 3, but its nkt going to hold at 400B market cap.\n\nBE CAREFUL WITH HYPE.\n\nDisclosure: I hold one put. And ill probably lose because i wont time it right.",

        "selftext": "A couple of weeks ago, I posted a comment in response to a question about ETFs. This question comes up very often; usually two or three times a week. Maybe more than than.  Several people suggested that it be \"pinned.\"  I obviously cannot do that, however if a mod wants to pin this, feel free to do so.  I did make a few modifications and additions to that comment and for those who haven't gone back to see the changes, I thought I'd post it again here.  Hopefully, this helps people who are interested in an investing approach that is either made up of ETFs or that includes ETFs as a part of their portfolio.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**QQQ** \\- This one uses the NASDAQ 100 as its benchmark. Obviously it's an Indexed, non-managed ETF. XTF used to rate this one as a perfect 10.0 out of 10 rating, but recently dropped it to 9.9 out of 10. It has one of the highest rates of return over the past 10 years of any ETF. It does tend to be tech-heavy, especially with the FAANG +M stocks. (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google and Microsoft). Other top holdings include TSLA, NVDA and ADBE. (The rating dropped recently when the portfolio of the NASDAQ 100 was re-balanced).\n\n**VOO**/**SPY** \\- **VOO** and **SPY** are non-managed funds indexed to the S&amp;P 500 Index. These funds are very popular on this subreddit, for good reason. They are well diversified, broad market funds investing in mostly US stocks. XTF rates these funds at 9.6 out of 10 because their return on investment over the long term is somewhat tempered by some of the blue chip stocks in the funds. But those stocks also help reduce volatility relative to some other ETFs. These are solid investments, but keep in mind that in the top 10 holdings there will be a lot of crossover between these funds and other broad market funds that hold US stocks like **QQQ**, **VTI**, **VTG**, **VOOG** and **SPYG**. There are differences, of course, as well, but you always want to know where those duplications exist.\n\n**IWF** \\- This is a Russell 1000 indexed fund. It is one of my favorites that doesn't get talked about much. It does have a lot of crossover with the other funds mentioned above, but the mix is slightly different. I would describe this fund as more aggressive than **VOO/SPY**, less volatile than **QQQ**.\n\n**IWM** \\- for someone looking to diversify a little bit, this is a great fund to look into. This fund is a non-managed, indexed fund that uses the Russell 2000 index as its benchmark. The big difference between the Russell 2000 index and many of the the other indexes is that the Russell 2000 index looks at small and mid-cap companies, rather than large-cap companies. Thus, there is zero crossover between this one and the funds mentioned above. While this fund will move up and down with the market, it is often less volatile than the market overall. If you look at the charts, this fund has under-performed some of the other funds over the past few months while the market has been very volatile in an upward direction, but in a crash, this fund would probably outperform the rest of the market. It has a 9.0/10 XTF rating.\n\n**VXUS** \\- Vanguard Total International Index Fund ETF - top holdings include BABA, Tencent, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductors, Novartis, Toyota. This is a broad market fund investing only in companies overseas. I'm not generally bullish on foreign markets, but this one is a very solid ETF with some companies that are likely to do extremely well for the foreseeable future. XTF rates this one a perfect 10.0 out of 10.\n\n**EEM** \\- iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF - This one is going to have a lot of crossover with **VXUS**. It is an Emerging Markets ETF with a lot of focus on China. It includes Alibaba, Tencent, [JD.com](https://jd.com/), along with companies like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductors. This one should be a solid performer as long as our trade relations with China remain normal.\n\n**EFA** \\- This is another international ETF, but here the focus is mainly on more established companies in Europe and Japan. This is a Large Cap ETF that includes companies like Nestle SA, Roche, Toyota, Novartis and AstraZeneca.\n\n**S*****ector fund ETFs:***\n\n**ICLN**/**TAN/FAN** \\- These funds are clean/renewable energy ETFs. **ICLN** is more broad while **TAN** focuses more specifically on solar energy and **FAN** specifically on wind generated energy. I think renewable energy companies are the future. There is no crossover in the top holdings of this fund with the top holdings of **QQQ** and most of the other broad market funds. Also, these are global, not just US based companies. **QCLN** and **PBW** are also renewable energy funds, but they also contain a lot of TSLA, NIO and W.K. H.S. in their top holdings making them \"electric vehicle\" funds, as well. No problem if you want to add that, but you'll find a lot of Tesla in some of the funds mentioned above.\n\n**ARK** **group of funds:**  **ARKG**, **ARKF**, **ARKK ARKW**, **ARKQ**, **PRNT** and **IZRL**. These are managed funds investing in companies that invest in disruptive companies in their respective industries. Most posters on this subreddit are bullish on these funds. They are aggressive growth ETFs, but should be considered somewhat risky and volatile.\n\n* **ARKG** \\- Genomic Revolution\n* **ARKF** \\- Fintech\n* **ARKK** \\- Disruptive Companies (broader market)\n* **ARKW** \\- Internet/computer/technology (Telsa is a top holding)\n* **ARKQ** \\- Robotics and artificial intelligence\n* **PRNT** \\- 3D printing technology\n* **IZRL** \\- disruptive companies based in Israel\n\n**XL series of funds**. Similar to the ARK series, these tend to be more aggressive growth funds, however these are passively managed indexed funds with various benchmarks that usually are overloaded in the better companies within a sector:\n\n* **XLV** \\- Health Care\n* **XLK** \\- Technology\n* **XLI** \\- Industrial\n* **XLY** \\- Consumer Discretionary\n* **XLP** \\- Consumer Staples\n* **XLF** \\- Financial\n* **XLRE** \\- Real Estate\n* **XLU** \\- Utilities\n* **XLE** \\- Energy/Oil\n\n**Cloud Computing** is another sector to consider. Some tickers in that sector include: **WCLD**, **SKYY**, **CLOU**, **BUG** and **XIKT**. Of these **WCLD** has the best 52 week performance. Top holdings in **WCLD** include **ZM**, **PLAN**, **CRM**, **CRWD**, **ZEN**, **WDAY**, **TENB**, **PCTY**, **DDOG**, **BL**. Many of these are likely to also appear in **QQQ**, however, they would be in very small percentages as the Cap on these companies is much smaller.\n\n***Other sector funds include:***\n\n**Health Care:** FHLC, VHT, IYH\n\n**Utilities:** IDU, VPU, FUTY, RYU\n\n**Oil/Energy:** IYE, FENY, VDE\n\n**Consumer Staples:** FSTA, VDC, IECS\n\n**Real Estate:** ICF, USRT, VNQ, PSR, BBRE\n\n**Media/Entertainment:** IEME, PBS, PEJ, IYC\n\n**Gaming/Casinos:** BJK, BETZ, CARZ\n\n**Transportation (including airlines):** JETS, XTN, FTXR, VIS\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n***A nice portfolio might look something like this:***\n\n**20%** \\- Broad market US fund such as QQQ, VOO or IWF\n\n**20%** \\- VXUS or one of the other International ETFs\n\n**20%** \\- IWM - Small/Mid-cap broad market fund\n\n**10%** **each** in four sector funds of your choice\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n*I'm not a financial expert or advisor and this is not financial advice, just an opinion from a random internet person.

        "selftext": "**I. INTRODUCTION**\n\n* When I look at the sentiment surrounding GameStop, it doesn\u2019t take very long to see [comments]( https://i.imgur.com/lndA70O.png) [like](https://i.imgur.com/Ec4z1fx.png) [these](https://i.imgur.com/6WoeXUS.png), yet here we [are](https://i.imgur.com/NpANVzR.png). What\u2019s going on? Are people that stupid? Just jumping on the new console cycle? Idiots not pulling their gains and going to zero? When even r/wsb thinks the stock is a dud, it must be right? Nearly 120% short interest, yet the stock is up nearly 40% this week. \n* Its no secret GameStop has been hurting. The secular shift to digital has been pressuring them for some time with their highest margin category - used video software \u2013 under significant distress. Each year their gross margins contract with net income in the red these past few quarters. Everybody has written them off as the easiest short in the world, however I'm going to try to explain whats going on and tell you that buying GameStop may not be as bad as you think.\n\n**II. CONSOLES**\n\n* Just to start things off, you have to remember we\u2019re in the beginnings of the new console cycle. But what does that even mean? Well the advent of new consoles means new trade-ins, new product, new customers, and a fresh spike in GameStop\u2019s popularity. Sales have stagnated the years prior, and they are all but certain to go up and remain elevated for the next 1-2 years. Note that against all counts, the company was actually profitable during the 2019 holiday season, with new consoles you can bet that they will annihilate all expectations and proceed into 4-8 more positive quarters off the cyclic shift. This is pretty unanimous, and everyone accepts that they will start reporting positive going forward. In fact, new console cycles are where GME has historically [spiked](https://i.imgur.com/LOehh3E.png).\n\n**III. POST CONSOLE CYCLE**\n\n* At this point, the focus turns to what happens once the hype dies down. Digital will continue to erode upon physical, but the key factor here is that physical is not actually dying off. [Its not](https://i.imgur.com/kmVPF39.png) [going to](https://i.imgur.com/rfRRGC9.png) zero. **The biggest reason physical is sequentially a lower percentage of the market is because the total market size is increasing.** Digital is shooting off while physical is largely stagnant. Note that physical games admittedly have their strengths. Not only are they structurally cheaper because you can resell them, they also have clear definitions of ownership and the collectability factor where you *need* to have a physical copy you can hold. In fact, [two thirds](https://www.limelight.com/resources/white-paper/state-of-online-gaming-2019/) of console video game players prefer physical vs digital.\n* While physical is here to stay, albeit at a weaker level, that isn\u2019t enough to turn the tides for GameStop. You see, GameStop knows digital is the trend and here to stay, they are not fighting it, **they are moving along the secular shift**. GameStop sells [digital games](https://i.imgur.com/RZJGjFE.png). GameStop is set to release a mobile app combining Game Informer and a online storefront by [month end](https://i.imgur.com/rdXejYc.png). They are doubling down on their online store with +500% ecommerce growth in [Q1]( http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-first-quarter-results) and +800% growth in [Q2](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-second-quarter-results-and-strong-progress). Expanding into numerous other [categories](https://i.imgur.com/QSkZEAw.png). Nearly 70% of their online orders were fulfilled on the same [day](https://i.imgur.com/NK8lkqD.png) leveraging their wide network of stores, of which they are pruning the excess. Also, Game prices are set to [increase $10](https://technosports.co.in/2020/09/19/sony-confirms-that-ps5-games-will-cost-up-to-69-99/). \n* GameStop\u2019s Loyalty Program accounts for over 55M [users](http://news.gamestop.com/fact-sheet-0). They intend on leveraging this network though a [company branded credit card](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-now-taking-pre-orders-sony-playstationr5-and-sony) with spending rewards to grab market share and retain customers. Furthermore, a digital revenue sharing model continues to [grow](https://i.imgur.com/V94FWJC.png) as publishers understand the value of GameStop as a customer acquisition service and that keeping the company afloat is better for sales and the general video game industry. (*[See the fall of Toys R us and its impact on Mattel/Hasbro](https://www.retaildive.com/news/the-toy-category-still-hasnt-recovered-from-the-death-of-toys-r-us/571701/); turns out the manufacturers really needed ToysRUs*)\n\n**VI. BALANCE SHEET**\n\n* But wait, their financials must be shit right? They have to be losing money. How much longer can they last? \n* Well it turns out their books are rock solid. They offered their creditors a new set of terms to push back debt for 2 years, 50% of them [took it](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-expiration-and-final-results-exchange-offer). They have eliminated all excess goodwill impairments. They are in a [$300M net cash position](https://i.imgur.com/HhfHaIT.png) with significantly reduced inventory (which explains the sharp reduction in Q1/2 sales) and massively cut SG&amp;A by 28% in preparation for the console cycle. [FCF KING](https://i.imgur.com/LYyrrUm.png)\n* Many believe the days of their strong margins are long gone, but in fact its only beginning. You have to remember, digital is only outpacing NEW physical games. [Retro games](https://thenextweb.com/gaming/2019/02/01/retro-consoles-video-game-sales-nostalgia/) are a [huge untapped market](https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/01/talking_point_how_much_is_your_video_game_collection_really_worth_to_you) where GameStop can replicate their past success, and it is a category digital can never penetrate. [Jesus wtf.](https://www.pricecharting.com/game/nes/little-samson) GameStop is looking into [these already](https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/retro-gaming/pre-owned)\n\n**V. MAJOR BACKING**\n\n* In fact, their ecommerce prospects are so promising, Ryan Cohen bought a [10% stake](https://investorplace.com/2020/08/gamestop-news-sends-gme-stock-soaring/). This guy took on Amazon and [won](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanverdon/2020/01/26/ryan-cohen-started-a-company-that-took-on-amazon-and-sold-it-for-3-billion-now-hes-thinking-about-whats-next/#7cdf60865579). [Jefferies](https://i.imgur.com/Duyxu1i.png) and [Talsey](https://i.imgur.com/K169L1N.png), wall street firms, came out with strong buy ratings citing company prospects. [Michael Burry](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/michael-burry-top-portfolio-holdings-massive-bet-alphabet-google-scion-2020-8-1029517864#) still holds a 5% stake. This guy took on Wall Street and won. [Half their creditors](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-expiration-and-final-results-exchange-offer) ($200M worth) believe in GameStop\u2019s prospects. Why would they defer their debt unless they believed the company will be in a paying position by 2023?\n\n**VI. THE SHORTS**\n\n* But here is the real kicker. GameStop\u2019s short float. 120% has never been seen before. The short theory was that GameStop would not make it to the new console cycle and the shorters would collect their tendies. But GameStop made it. Current short fees are like 60% and from some figures we can draw on, we estimate that around 70% of the shorts got in [under $7](https://i.imgur.com/wRaMbLx.png), GameStop is currently nearing $10. **70% of the shorts are underwater.** Even if you don\u2019t believe that any of their initiatives will work you have to admit that the company will be able to continue operating for another two years off the new console hype alone. When the stock hits roughly $15, we can expect to see several margin calls trigger a fucking massive short squeeze. For reference, [Blue Apron](https://i.imgur.com/6EqU417.png), [Volkswagen](https://i.imgur.com/S3DHn3j.gif).\n\n**VII. CONCLUSION**\n\n* Just the fact GME got to the new console cycle must be making the shorts cry. Add on that they\u2019ve been making serious progress towards online and mobile presence, aligning themselves with industry trends, operating in a growing market, potential monopoly in the untapped retro market, solid financials, beginning their new upward cyclic cycle; you have the makings of a powerful ecommerce storefront just leaning into their growth period. Even post console hype, they should be able to leverage their branded credit card to retain a huge number of customers and bite off huge market share off other retailers. Lastly, remember that despite the trend towards digital, its in the gaming industry's best interest to keep GameStop going strong. The likelihood of additional revenue sharing agreements are fairly high.\n* For comparison GameStop has a P/S ratio 0.11. Chewy has a P/S ratio of 3.6. If GME begins to grow their revenue from this point its valuation will begin to normalize. Even a P/S of 0.2 would mean a stock price of ~$16, 0.4 would mean $32. The company is going to ride the console hype and likely trigger more than a few margin calls along the way. Everything management has been doing is to ride the new cycle into a fluid ecommerce business model, and everything I'm seeing suggests its going to work. \n\n[Tl;dr](https://i.redd.it/bxn2mf4bzoj41.jpg)\n\n10c 9/25 to play XBOX prerelease\n\n10c 10/2 to play Mobile App/Stimulus \n\n10c 11/20 to play Console Release Date\n\n10c 4/16 to play Holiday Earnings/short squeeze\n\n***most text references are from GameStop's Q2 transcript which you can find [here.](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/09/10/gamestop-gme-q2-2020-earnings-call-transcript/)",

        "selftext": "Back in March, long before a short seller would raise questions about electric-truck company Nikola Corp. and hasten its founder\u2019s exit, early investors in the company were expressing concerns of their own.Those investors, led by mutual-fund giant Fidelity Investments, were worried that Trevor Milton, for all his brash visionary talk and Twitter braggadocio, lacked the ability that Elon Musk possesses to deliver these sorts of newfangled products to market. They lobbied successfully to remove him as CEO before the company\u2019s June IPO and for Milton\u2019s father to leave the board, according to people familiar with the matter. When the deal was done, Milton only held the title of chairman, the post he resigned this month.\n\nThe back-room negotiations show that Milton\u2019s past was a concern to investors months before General Motors Co. executives placed a bet on the company in a US$2 billion deal carved out after the IPO. They liked Milton\u2019s vision and his ability to raise cash and felt the venture was safeguarded from his shortcomings in operations by his push upstairs, say people familiar with the matter. Nonetheless, the events that have unfolded since the short-seller report, with Nikola\u2019s stock plunging amid a steady stream of negative headlines, have exposed just how high the risks still were.\n\nNow, it\u2019s up to former GM Vice Chairman Steve Girsky, whose blank-check company VectoIQ took Nikola public via reverse merger in June, and Nikola CEO Mark Russell to stabilize the business and regain investor confidence. The plan with GM was to use Nikola\u2019s hot stock and Milton\u2019s ability to raise money to build a hydrogen-fueled trucking business with GM\u2019s technology.\n\n\u201cThere is obviously someone on the diligence side who isn\u2019t going to get a nice bonus this year,\u201d said Reilly Brennan, founder of the venture capital fund Trucks Inc. \u201cThe best possible thing if you\u2019re a shareholder is that Milton is no longer running the company and you have Girsky as chairman and GM providing technology.\u201d\n\nThe GM deal was originally scheduled to close Sept. 30, and the automaker has said it plans to carry through, but that timing may slip, say people familiar with the matter. BP Plc is still engaged with Nikola in talks to partner on a network of hydrogen fueling stations for fuel-cell trucks the company hopes to sell, but also is slowing the pace for a deal, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. BP and GM declined to comment.\n\nMilton\u2019s tale reads like a Greek tragedy. The report by short seller Hindenburg Research accused Milton of overhyping Nikola\u2019s technology and has prompted investigations by the Justice Department and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. A cousin has accused him of a decades-ago sexual assault, which he denies. The company\u2019s value peaked at US$30 billion and is now worth about US$7 billion.\n\nGirsky and GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra have both said publicly that they did plenty of due diligence. People familiar with the matter say that GM found out when scouting the deal that it had better batteries and fuel-cell technology but joined forces because Nikola had a working semi truck and access to capital markets. In addition, GM will get paid to build Nikola\u2019s Badger pickup on existing assembly lines. Milton was so excited to get the Badger pickup program moving that he signed a deal that heavily favored GM, one of the people said.\n\nNikola\u2019s stock and GM\u2019s US$2 billion stake are worth less than half what they were on Sept. 8, when the deal was announced. Milton\u2019s own stake is worth US$1.7 billion, down from almost US$5 billion at one point.\n\nMilton said in a June interview with Bloomberg News that he grew up in modest surroundings in Layton, Utah. His family moved to Las Vegas when he was very young and he lost his mother to cancer shortly after moving back to Utah in the sixth grade. He wrote on Twitter he didn\u2019t finish high school, earning an equivalency certification instead, and later dropped out of college. His Twitter account has since been deleted.\n\nHe grew up in a tight-knit Mormon family, according to Aubrey Smith, his first cousin. She went on social media recently and accused him of sexually assaulting her in 1999 when she was 15 and he was 17.\n\nIn a public account on Facebook and Twitter, and repeated in a phone interview, Smith said that Milton came onto her at the funeral of their grandfather. He took her shirt off without permission, Smith wrote, and then he touched her inappropriately before someone knocked at the door and she ran out.\n\nMilton denied the allegations through a spokesman.\n\nSmith said Milton raised money from family members to get his start. He founded and ran several businesses, including a home-security company that Milton claims he sold for US$1.5 million. Next, in 2009, he founded an e-commerce platform called Upillar.com, which Milton claims \u201cpioneered the shopping cart online.\u201d\n\nThen he got into clean propulsion but ended up embroiled in litigation with dHybrid Inc., which he founded in 2009. The company retrofitted diesel vehicles with natural-gas-burning turbines, claiming the dual system had greater efficiency.\n\nBut a deal with Swift Transportation Co. in 2010 ended in court when Swift alleged dHybrid defaulted on a US$322,000 loan and that it retrofitted only half of the agreed vehicles. The case was dismissed in 2015.\n\nMilton later tried to sell dHybrid to a company called sPower in May 2012 but that, too, got mired in lawsuits after sPower backed out and accused Milton of exaggerating its technological capabilities.\n\nAmid the litigation, Milton started another company with a very similar name, dHybrid Systems, selling it in 2014 to Worthington Industries.\n\nDuring an interview with Bloomberg in June, Milton said that dHybrid Inc. was a success but conceded that, \u201cwe ended up closing that one down because of some litigation.\u201d\n\nHis next startup was Nikola, founding it in 2014 in Salt Lake City before moving to Phoenix. Emulating Musk, he took the name from the electricity pioneer Nikola Tesla, and the company was soon billed as the Tesla of Trucks. His plan was seen as potentially disrupting the entire transportation industry by making trucks that ran on batteries or hydrogen-fuel cells. He also planned to build a network of hydrogen filling stations.\n\nFriends and Family\n\nMilton had friends and family members working for Nikola despite resumes that didn\u2019t match the job. His brother, Travis Milton, is director of hydrogen and infrastructure. His LinkedIn profile shows that most of his experience was being \u201cself-employed\u201d in Maui. The short seller, Hindenburg Research, said that Travis Milton poured concrete as a contractor. Milton\u2019s father Bill was originally on the board but stepped down when VectoIQ took the company public.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock prospectus said that Nikola had awarded more than 3 million stock options \u201cto recognize the superior performance and contribution of specific employees.\u201d The list included Travis Milton and an uncle, Lance Milton, the document said, acknowledging that they are relatives.\n\nAs Milton went public with Nikola\u2019s technology, questions soon arose involving his claims about the company\u2019s fuel-cell system. He bragged in an investor video in 2019 that the company had created \u201cwhat other manufacturers said was impossible to design.\u201d But while Nikola holds patents in fuel-cell and battery technology, most of its planned hardware was coming from German supplier Robert Bosch Gmbh.\n\nNikola Demonstrations\n\nIt became clear that Milton had gotten ahead of himself. A 2016 demonstration showed a truck that didn\u2019t have a working hydrogen-fuel-cell system and was missing key parts, people familiar with the matter said in June. Milton said at the time that the parts were removed as a safety precaution.\n\nIn July of this year, he recorded a video of the semi truck in which he ran alongside the vehicle as it coasted at low speeds in a parking lot. Aping Musk\u2019s combative social-media persona, Milton took a shot at his detractors saying, \u201cthese damned trolls, I wonder if they are going to apologize to everyone for the lies they spread the tens of thousands of comments about how fake we are.\u201d\n\nGirsky said in the webcast \u201cAutoline This Week,\u201d in which Bloomberg participated, that he has been in Nikola\u2019s fuel-cell trucks and that they work.\n\nStill, when the GM deal was done, GM will be supplying all of the technology for every global market except Europe. Nikola\u2019s pickup truck, called Badger, will use GM\u2019s Ultium battery, and the semis will run on a fuel cell developed by GM and Honda Motor Co.\n\nSince Milton\u2019s departure, Nikola has billed itself more as an integrator of other technologies into its Badger pickup and semi trucks.\n\nFor GM\u2019s part, the automaker is protected from any financial downside. GM got 11 per cent of the stock for no cash investment and gets paid for its technology. If Nikola fails, GM won\u2019t lose a dime.\n\nMilton has remained silent and is out of the company. He unknowingly presaged his own downfall in the June interview with Bloomberg: \u201cPart of becoming a better person in life is losing everything you have got and having nothing left.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/nikola-founder-milton-s-fall-reveals-what-his-backers-feared-1.1500376",

        "selftext": "Maybe it's just me, and this is being said as someone who's nearly always bullish, does it not seem a little.. unnatural the lack of Red days we're having? The last even slightly significant Red day we've had was on July 22nd, a bit over 5 weeks ago, and that wasn't even bad.\n\nIt just seems really weird even given the Fed backstop that we've had really no Red days at all in over a month.

Even the greatest climbs I've seen have a sprinkling of a -1.5% or -2% day in there every now and then.\n\nIt just feels so unnatural. So odd. I'm not even Bearish. I have no puts, no reverse index positions. I just feel really uneasy. \n\nI'm not claiming we're in a Bubble, or this is the top, or that there's Euphoria. I'm just trying to gauge if anyone else has noticed this? This extremely unnatural stretch of 0 significant Red days at all.",

        "selftext": "# Introduction\n\nThis will be long, but it will also be concise, and is filled with information. Do yourself a favor and read it thoroughly. Don't complain that I got something wrong if you only skimmed the post.\n\nI've been studying options for years, and have read great books such as OAASI cover to cover. In other words, I know some shit. My goal here is to impart a simple strategy that can significantly outperform a \"buy and hold\" strategy on any major index, both so you can make tendies SAFELY, but also to rub it in the faces of those no-nothing /r/investing types who shun options.\n\nOne final note before we begin. I realize you can potentially increase returns on this strategy by utilizing margin to sell naked options and such... but I don't want to advocate a strategy that could blow up retards accounts. What I will advocate here is a 100% cash strategy and has no risk of a margin call.\n\n**This strategy is necessarily no riskier than buying and holding an index fund.**\n\nIf you insist on using margin to increase your returns, I would suggest simply using margin to own double the amount of assigned and held stock, in order to sell double the number of covered calls. This is a relatively safe way to increase returns.\n\n# The Wheel: An IMPROVED \"Buy and Hold\" Strategy\n\nForget credit spreads, diagonal spreads, iron condors, and all that often complicated jazz. The absolute best and simplest theta gang strategy, in my humble opinion, is The Wheel. But I'm going to argue for a very specific version of The Wheel here, and that makes all the difference.\n\nWhile spreads can be effective, we want to maximize returns by collecting FULL PREMIUM for options, and not hedging like a pussy.\n\n**When you think about The Wheel, I want you to picture an IMPROVED \"buy and hold\" strategy.**\n\nThe tried and true advice of most financial advisors out there is to drop cash in something like an index fund and forget about it. While this is good and all, we can clearly do better, by utilizing options. What we are attempting here is to mimic a \"buy and hold\" strategy, while consistently augmenting returns by collecting option premium on top.\n\nThe Wheel is a simple concept. You sell cash-secured puts and collect premium. If you ever get assigned, you hold and sell covered calls on the assigned stock. If your stock ever gets called away, you go back to selling puts. Rinse and repeat, ad infinitum.\n\nThe question of which options to sell and why gets complicated, and I will go into details below, but for simplicity I am advocating simply sticking to 30-45 DTE \\~0.30 delta options on major ETFs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vntvxqycv5p51.png?width=1286&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0b92bc6d4ecc345f07f4bf09ca2fd4f3f954f85\n\n# The Basic Concept\n\nYou want to get PAID to buy stock at a CHEAP price. You can do that by selling OTM cash-secured puts. And you want to get PAID to sell stock at a HIGH price. You can do that by selling OTM covered calls. When you understand this basic concept, you understand 90% of this strategy.\n\nThis will outperform \"buy and hold\" for two reasons: 1) It collects option premium on top of stock appreciation, 2) It reduces the cost basis for potential stock purchases. These factors also ensure reduced volatility compared with \"buy and hold,\" as both premium and reduced entry points offer downside protection from falling assets. This is inherently a long-term strategy; if you are unwilling to hold an ETF long-term through a drop or even a recession, don't waste your time... you WILL lose money.\n\nWhen I've looked for counter-arguments to The Wheel strategy, the common argument I hear is \"it works until it doesn't.\" In other words, these people argue that if you run The Wheel on a stock that drops hard and doesn't recover, you will lose money.\n\n**This argument completely falls apart if you run The Wheel on INDEX ETFs.**\n\nSPY and other major indices have recovered from every crash they have ever experienced. Individual stocks like Enron have not. If we want to mimic a conservative \"buy and hold\" strategy WITH diversification, we will only play major ETFs. This eliminates the major argument against The Wheel entirely, since it achieves instant diversification and will mimic the broader market. If you think the US economy will crash and never recover, you should be buying guns and ammo and not options.\n\nThe only REAL argument against The Wheel is that you could potentially lose out on stock appreciation during heavy bull runs. While this is true, we will show below that this argument doesn't hold much weight.\n\n# Calculating Returns\n\nIt is relatively simple to calculate potential returns for this strategy, so I will do that now using option prices on SPY as of 9/24/2020. Keep in mind IV is currently high, and so these returns will be inflated relative to a calmer market. Also keep in mind that annualizing returns based on one-month results can get wonky. *This is just an example to get a picture of how things work.*\n\nThere are two phases to this strategy: Selling CSP's and selling CC's. We will calculate each separately, using 30 DTE options and ignoring compounding for simplicity.\n\n**CSP Return (Conservative 0.30 delta):**\n\n\\[(CSP premium \\* 100 shares) / collateral\\] \\* 12 months = Return\n\n\\[($5.30 \\* 100) / $31,000\\] \\* 12 = **20.5% return**\n\n**CSP Return (Aggressive ATM/0.50 delta):**\n\n\\[(9.00 \\* 100) / $32,000\\] \\* 12 = **33.7% return**\n\n**CC Return (Conservative 0.30 delta):**\n\nS&amp;P500 return + \\[(CC premium \\* 100 shares) / collateral\\] \\* 12 months = Return\n\nS&amp;P500 return + \\[($4.12 \\* 100) / $32,500\\] \\* 12 = **S&amp;P return + 15.5%**\n\nNow there are a few caveats for the above calculations. The first is that if the S&amp;P500 rallies well past our CC strike price, we will lose out on those potential gains. This means the CC-side return for the S&amp;P is capped, which can be calculated as follows:\n\n**Maximum CC Return:**\n\n\\[(Strike price - stock price) \\* 100 shares + (CC premium \\* 100 shares)\\] / collateral = Return (one month)\n\n\\[($334 - $325) \\* 100 + ($4.12 \\* 100)\\] / $32,500 = **4.0% (48% annualized)**\n\nBy reversing this we can calculate how much SPY would have to rise to outperform us.\n\n$325 \\* 1.04 = $338\n\nIn other words, if SPY rises more than $13 in one month it will outperform us, but only for THAT MONTH. Obviously the S&amp;P doesn't achieve 48% returns annually and so bull months will be offset by flat and bear months. We will outperform the S&amp;P in both those categories as shown above, which will more than make up the difference in lost potential gains.\n\nOne final note: These calculations assume that all options are held until expiration. In practice, returns can be increased by closing winning positions early. If you achieve 70% gain in 10 days, it makes little sense to wait another 20 days to collect the remaining 30% premium. Simply close and roll as necessary.\n\n# A Guide for Smaller Accounts + Proof of Concept\n\nTo run the strategy I am advocating on SPY, you would need a minimum account size of \\~$35,000. I know a lot of you don't have that much money, so I've done a little experiment for smaller accounts.\n\nI set aside a fund to run The Wheel on smaller ETFs, such as XLE, XLF, and GDX. To run the wheel on these individually you would need an account size no bigger than \\~$4000. Even smaller ETFs such as SILJ could be run for as little as $1500, though they are more risky and less liquid. To prove the concept for smaller accounts, I set aside $10,000 and ran smaller ETFs such as these for 4 months.\n\n**After 4 months, I achieved a 41% annualized return. This outperformed the SPY ETF during the same period by around 5%, despite the fact the ETFs utilized underperformed relative to SPY. This, in my view, provides some proof of concept.**\n\nObviously this return would have dropped significantly during this recent market drop, which is why I stopped running the strategy on the 18th, to avoid losing my own money just for proof of concept. The best strategy will always be adaptive to market conditions, but if you want a one-size-fits-all approach, The Wheel is probably the best you can get.\n\nIn one instance I used margin to purchase an additional 100 shares of SILJ to sell a second CC for \"free\" (minus margin costs), just to offer an example of how margin can be safely used to increase returns. I also sold ATM options on SILJ shares because I wanted to dump it quickly before the crash, and to collect higher premiums. Got very lucky and sold right before the drop on Monday. This is an example of how to adapt the strategy based on your market predictions.\n\nHere is a complete breakdown of my trades during this 4 month period. **Notice that I usually closed positions early in order to increase my $/day return.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v80b50jfv5p51.png?width=1433&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=469d57e6bcce2c51641a211801d5997f05675e4b\n\n# A Note on Past Wheel Guides\n\nA prominent past guide on running The Wheel argued that you should always avoid assignment. However, they never made a compelling case for WHY you should avoid assignment. There is an argument to be made for such a position, which I will provide soon. However, there are also a number of arguments to be made in favor of accepting or even seeking assignment. They run as follows:\n\n1) Time Premium is maximized when the strike price is ATM. If we are selling time premium (Theta), selling ATM will tend to maximize premium returns long-term.\n\n[Apparently this picture didn't exist on the internet until now...](https://preview.redd.it/16ijbdsgv5p51.jpg?width=4608&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb7fda8a060de84719695afc98c09f8bb7f644f9)\n\n2) If we are bullish on an Index long-term, we shouldn't have any problem accepting stock ownership. In fact, it will likely increase our returns due to stock appreciation on top of option premium.\n\n3) Stock can be more easily owned on margin than options. Holding double the stock on margin and selling twice as many covered-calls will outperform selling cash-secured puts long-term.\n\nThese past guides also focused on running The Wheel on individual stocks. I have so far not yet seen a guide advocating The Wheel purely on Index ETFs to mimic and outperform a \"buy and hold\" diversified strategy. **This is perhaps the most important takeaway from this guide.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Maximizing Returns: ATM vs. OTM?**\n\nThis strategy is simple enough... Where it gets complicated is in the details. And the most difficult question of all is whether to sell ATM, or OTM, and if so how deep?\n\nLet's start with the absolute ideal scenarios...\n\n**In a bull market: You want to sell ATM puts and OTM calls.**\n\n**In a bear market: You want to sell OTM puts and ATM calls.**\n\n**In a completely flat market: You want to sell ATM puts and ATM calls.**\n\nThe reasoning is simple. If the market is rising, you want to maximize premium on your puts by selling ATM. You also want OTM calls so you don't lose out on gains in stock appreciation when the price rises. The ideal depth for OTM calls would be just above the total underlying appreciation (which obviously is difficult to predict in advance).\n\nBy the same token, if the market is falling, you want to sell OTM puts for downside protection against assignment, and you want to sell ATM calls to maximize premium.\n\nIn a flat market you simply want to maximize premium and have no need for upside or downside protection, and so ATM will perform best.\n\nIf you are brilliant and prescient like me, you can navigate these complicated waters and adapt to the market accordingly. If you are a retard, on the other hand, you can't easily predict where the market is headed...\n\nIn that case, my advice is the following:\n\nALWAYS SELL OTM ON BOTH ENDS. This will give you downside protection from drops, and also give you upside protection from rallies. The consequence of this is your premium returns will be reduced relative to someone who strategically sells ATM options, but that is an acceptable loss for a safer and more conservative strategy if you don't know wtf you are doing. **You will still outperform \"buy and hold\" using this strategy, while also achieving reduced volatility.**\n\nAiming for selling .30 delta, or 70% Prob ITM options, seems conservative enough for me. You can adjust accordingly based on your personal risk tolerance. If you want a more conservative strategy, aim further OTM. If you want more aggressive strategy, aim closer ATM. Keep in mind you MUST be willing to hold stock long-term through a drop to make this strategy viable! If you aren't willing to actually \"buy and hold\" while selling covered calls, look to gamble elsewhere.\n\n# Other Details\n\nThe reasoning for selling 30-45 DTE options, which is advocated by TastyTrade among others, is because theta decay for ATM options accelerates around this range. However, this is only true for ATM options, and OTM options theta decay can actually decelerate closer to expiration. It is likely better to go for longer dated OTM options for this reason, though it won't make a huge difference imo. I would suggest keeping things simple and maintaining a habit around this range.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s3hl0wekv5p51.png?width=586&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68e42cee750063a6932f96c151a8fb779f292467\n\nSome people attempt to run The Wheel by selling short-term weeklies/FDs. These individuals are not really selling theta so much as they are attempting to scalp gamma. While this can work, it is not really the consistent, safe, long-term strategy we are looking for here. It also suffers from the reduced theta decay for OTM options which I stated above. If you want to gamble, you might as well be BUYING the FD's, not SELLING them!\n\nI would usually close my options at 50%+ return and roll forward/up when necessary. This will tend to yield greater $/day returns if the underlying is moving in your direction. For example: If you make 80% return in 10 days, it makes little sense to hold another 20+ days for another 20% premium gain. Simply close the position and collect the secured premium to release collateral for another sell. If the underlying is moving against your direction, you generally want to hold until expiration and collect 100% of the premium, even if that means assignment. **Closing a sold option for a loss will DESTROY the returns of The Wheel! Do not do this!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**This is probably already too long, so I will stop here. I apologize if I've made any mistakes while writing this. Feel free to ask any questions and I will do my best to answer them!**",

        "selftext": "Apparently, after CNBC's LeBeau commented \"Don't be surprised if $GM takes a greater than 11% stake\", NKLA has jumped 10% easy.\n\nUmmmm, for those buyers on this headline, do you still remember what the deal was?\n\nHere is the link to the SEC 8-K report [https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-102820/](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-102820/), which should give you the most information on the deal.\n\nTo sum it up, NKLA was going to give, **GIVE, NOT SELL,** 2 billion USD worth of stocks to GM, **for 0 cent in return**. In addition, **GM will also** **be paid** to supply batteries,manufacture NKLA's trucks. **And GM will also receive Nikola's emission credits**. \n\nThis is a shit deal for Nikola. So why would NKLA have agreed to this? Because N**KLA has no capability to build a truck by itself**. It only knows how to integrate. In order to build the Nikola Badger, it has to partner up with GM. **NKLA simply CANNOT do this job by itself.**\n\nNow, frauds claims have plagued NKLA's stocks for weeks. If you are Mary Barra, do you have to walk away from the deal? Hmmm. Why would you? **Why would you walk away from 2 billion dollars for free PLUS a battery customer**? You have nothing to lose here, except for some reputation, since Barra said \"appropriate due-dillgence\" was done. But hey, what due-dilligence needs to be done? **NO DUE-DILLIGENCE needs to be done.** **If you have nothing to lose in a deal, and you can walk away freely, why would you need to do any due-dilligence?**\n\nNow, since the deal has not been closed, and NKLA's share has plummetted more than 50%. If you are Mary Barra, who wants to continue to pursue this \"no-lose\" deal anyway, WOULD YOU STILL ACCEPT THE OLD TERMS? Hey, Nikola, you agreed to give me 2 billion worth (or 11%) of stake when the company was worth 20B, now your company is worth 7B, **OF COURSE I WANT MORE THAN 11% OF YOUR DAMN STAKES NOW right**? Original 2 billion worth of stocks will now be 27% of the company.\n\nAnd now, CNBC's LeBeau speaks, \"GM may take more than 11% stake on NKLA\". Hey bro, **I need you to tell me this shit information**? Yeah, NKLA is 10% up now. But wait a minute, **how can this shitty deal, which now benefits GM even more, benefit NKLA in anyway at all**? Nope, I dont't see it.\n\nMaybe the LeBeau guy is long NKLA stocks, now he plays with words to fool you retards. Headlines easily fool retards. Why spend ten minutes reading into the story and doing the thinking, while you can simply make your investment decision after spending 10 seconds reading a headline? (I mean, just look at SNOW's rise 2 days ago)\n\nIn the end, I simply can't emphasize enough, **this deal is sweet for GM and horrible for NKL**A. But NKLA has to take it because it is desperate. It's simply unable to build trucks by itself. \n\n**Risk disclaimer: I am not telling you NKLA share will go down**. Although I am short NKLA, the greater fool theory tell us, as long as there are more people misunderstanding the headline, the stock may go up. **Invest with caution.**",

        "selftext": "Hopefully, my name isn't too biased here. But I will reiterate what people talk about any time AMD is mentioned in the past two months.\n\n1: AMD's CPU leaked yesterday. And to say the least, it looks promising. Article below as I will not go into depth on this. In summary, Intel has had a better CPU for years but this looks like its changing. If priced similarly to previous CPU's, AMD will no doubt be the leader in this price range. \n\nhttps://www.techradar.com/news/amd-ryzen-7-5800x-leak-shows-a-powerhouse-gaming-cpu-that-could-embarrass-intels-core-i9-10900k\n\n\n\n2: AMD/NVIDIA battle. For a long time, NVIDIA has been the leader in the GPU battle. With the horrid launch of the 30xx series and recent leaks about AMD's GPU price to performance, its looking more and more like AMD will take market share from NVIDIA.\n      -Many retailers report not even getting 3000 series cards\n      -Huge driver issues making games unplayable\n      -Scalpers/bots taking all the available cards and reselling\n\n\n3: AMD is selling both XBOX and PS5 their Zen and RDNA chips. There is no other competition and production numbers are being met. \n\nhttps://www.pocket-lint.com/laptops/news/playstation/153151-amd-chips-xbox-series-x-playstation-5-ps5-schedule\n\n\n4. Lisa Su (AMD CEO). This summary below linked by u/Souskei about how she revived AMD is why I personally have so much faith in the company. \n\n\nhttps://medium.com/@jyjayy94/dr-lisa-su-the-living-legend-of-amd-7e0173d3a4a4\n\n\n\n**IMPORTANT DATES**\n\nAMD ZEN 3 reveal October 8th\n\nAMD GPU reveal October 28th\n\nAMD earnings announcement November 3rd (expected $.31 compared to $.14 for last year same quarter)\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-announces-keynote-dates-for-zen-3-and-big-navi\n\n\nThe next month is one of the most important months AMD has had in years. I am fully expecting them to crush it and finally be on Intel/Nvidia's level after years of playing catch up. \n\n*We don't need to bring up previous AMD driver issues* \n\n\n**My recommendations for options**\n\nFull disclaimer. I am in for 20 Nov 90C. Now let's look at Bid/ask spreads, volume, and the greeks below.\n\n\nI will only look at option chains expiring after November due to all the announcements in October. \n\n**6 Nov** is not worth it for reasons below.\n   - the average bid/ask spread is 40 cents for OTM/ITM calls. Personally I usually buy close ITM calls for the delta/theta movement as it is safer. \n   -Theta for closer OTM calls are already at .11\n   -Delta is hovering at about .5 which is okay, but preferably since its a month away, we would want it a little more. No doubt it will move up as AMD increases. But so will Theta for an option expiring a week after the announcements.\n\n\n**20 Nov**\n    -My position of choice due to much smaller bid/ask because I'm not a fan of losing money to MM's. \n    - Theta of .6/.7 right now which buys us more time. \n    -Since I plan on selling the options during early November, I still have adequate time to not get wrecked by theta and let delta move in my favor. \n\n\n**15 Jan 21**\n\n    - Another recommendation of mine. Earnings will be about to be fully reported. VOL will be high and so will the expectations. The play is up to you here. But i recommend anything over $95 at minimum.",

        "selftext": "Every week for the past 8 weeks, I've seen non-stop posts about how people are having great FOMO on TSLA. How they wish they had gotten in at $1000, $1300, $1500, $1750, $2000.\n\nEveryone asking about best price to get in, whether it will go higher, etc.\n\nWell, now TSLA is down almost 40% from its ATH post-split. Pre-split it was at $2200. Then there was a 5:1 split, which drove the price to $440, at which point it rocketed up to $500 (or $3000 pre-split).\n\nNow TSLA has cratered all the way to $340 (or $1700 pre-split). Its back at the price point it was at right after the split was announced. Its still high for some people here, but its trading at a discount from its ATH of $3000.\n\nTo all those TSLA FOMO-er's, its time to step up to their conviction. Do you believe in TSLA as the \"company of the future\" that has a valuation potential that can't be captured (ie. ARKK's perspective, and hence their $7000 pre-split price target potential).\n\nAdded fun: AMD, BA, MSFT, AAPL are all hammered right now. Again, these are all stocks that I've seen people have incredible FOMO about missing the August run up. If you genuinely believe these stocks have a future, and are thinking long term (ie. over 1 year holdings), these price points are good entries for a DCA strategy. Basically, all these stocks gave up ALL their August gains, which means if you missed the boat at the end of July, nows the time to get back in because the train came back to the station.\n\nIf you believe the valuations of these stocks are still too high, then feel free to disregard this entire post.",

        "selftext": "Our devine overlords in Germany decided that you can't deduct your losses against your gains anymore. Or well only up to 10k within a year. Yes you read that right. You can lose money and still owe taxes. I expect some DP loss porn in 2022. You made 800k from your 10k through stupid trades and lost it all within the same year? You're in for a rude awakening after 2020 in Germany.\n\nThis retarded law means that your taxes trading derivatives can easily be multiple times higher than: your gains, your portfolio, your net worth. All possible with the buying power of a typical 4 digit account. Guaranteed financial disaster with the following single trade:\n\nBuy 100 AMZN 3010c AUG21, sell 100 AMZN  3000c AUG21 in one transaction. In other words, its an ITM bear call spread. Margin required to open this: probably below 10k. You tax bill if AMZN will trade below 3000 in August 2021: 1.8 million. \\~70.9k gain per lot on one side and a loss of \\~70k on the other derivative. Under  normal circumstances this means a gain of max 1k per contract and it depends on how much premium you got initially. Not with this new clever tax law, because you also \"gained\" money here!\n\nIts even more absurd if AMZN trades at like 8000 in August. Now  normally, you would have lost all the money on your bear call spread,  but now you also get to pay taxes on a gain of 5000\\*100\\*100 = 50 million,  too. Genius.\n\nIf you're an active trader, you can easily do worse than in this example. It's basically outlawing derivatives, \"because they are bad, mkay\". Because its going to be an absolute mine field after 2020 if you are German.\n\nGerman article (you can use Chrome to automatically translate this): [https://www.fundresearch.de/steuern/warum-die-neue-derivate-steuer-ab-januar-fatale-folgen-hat.php](https://www.fundresearch.de/steuern/warum-die-neue-derivate-steuer-ab-januar-fatale-folgen-hat.php)",

        "selftext": "Shortsellers are going after our favorite stocks to profit therefore we should despise them right? But are they all really bad? \n\nDon\u2019t just read articles and blog posts that confirm your view about a company. ***Right  now a lot of $TSLA &amp; $NKLA shareholders are mad about shortsellers  going after their stock but in fact you should embrace it.***\n\nShortsellers do research that you could ***never do on your own***.  In fact I would love it if someone would give me a 50 page report on  everything thats wrong with any of my holdings. I know whats right about  all the companies I own. What I want to know are the flaws, the  accounting issues ( if there are any ) etc.\n\nWith Luckin Coffee Muddy Waters Research bought thousands of cups of  coffee from different branches and kept an eye on the customers. Thats  invaluable research and in the end they were right that the numbers  don\u2019t match up. \n\nThey probably saved a lot of Luckin Coffee Shareholders from bigger  losses ( those who read the report). And of course short sellers should  get compensated for this work. There have to be incentives to do this  kind of work. Else nobody would do it. Don\u2019t count on auditors which are  incentivized to look the other way and keep a paying client.When you\u2019re  an analyst you can just say you think revenue will go up but you don\u2019t  need to back it up. \n\nThats it. But when you accuse someone of fraud then you better have a  lot of evidence to support this view. Short sellers face potential  losses &amp; lawsuit. If they are wrong they lose a lot. Thats why they  work hard and only release reports when they have enough to back up  their claim. Also what do Companies like Nikola have to worry about ? If  everything is fine then the Hindenburg report will turn out false and  they continue to enjoy a rising share price. **But what if the report is right?**\n\nIf you are a Nikola shareholder then you should pay attention to it.  Read it and work this into your thesis for owning the stock. Is it worth  the risk? Maybe limit your exposure.But don\u2019t ridicule the people that  release those reports. There is a lot of hard work &amp; money behind  it.\n\n***Short sellers don\u2019t do this for the fun of it.***  And if they are right they should be compensated for their work. I  would actually say that many short sellers work much harder on research  than a long analyst. After all they have to be right to make money. If  they\u2019re wrong they won\u2019t be able to enjoy market returns. They would  literally get wiped out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nsource: [https://welovevalue.com/short-sellers-are-good-for-the-market/](https://welovevalue.com/short-sellers-are-good-for-the-market/)",

        "selftext": " \n\n[SoftBank Group Corp.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/9984:JP) shares tumbled in Tokyo trading after reports that the Japanese conglomerate made substantial bets on equity derivatives amid the surge in technology stocks.\n\nSoftBank shares dropped as much as 5.4%, the most on an intraday basis since April. The stock had gained 33% this year before Monday.\n\nThe Financial Times, Wall Street Journal and [Zero Hedge](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/QG8ZJIMB2SJO) reported that SoftBank was making massive bets on technology stocks using equity derivatives. The FT labeled SoftBank the \u201cNasdaq whale\u201d that \u201cstoked the fevered rally in big tech stocks,\u201d though it didn\u2019t include details of any trading. The FT later reported that SoftBank is sitting on trading gains of about $4 billion after founder Masayoshi Son\u2019s bets on equity derivatives, citing people with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\n The Japanese conglomerate [said in August](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-11/softbank-returns-to-profit-after-record-losses-on-startup-bets) that it was starting a new unit to trade public securities, pushing beyond its traditional base in telecommunications and private startup investments. Bloomberg [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-11/softbank-is-said-to-target-over-10-billion-in-public-investing) in August that SoftBank was targeting investments of more than $10 billion, perhaps tens of billions, and would use financing structures that would allow the company to avoid showing up in public disclosures of shareholding. \n\n \n\nThe Japanese company\u2019s derivatives strategy has been built over the past few months, the FT cited the people as saying, adding that SoftBank has spent about $4 billion on options premiums focused on tech stocks over that time. SoftBank now has large but unrealized profits, and the trades have been deeply controversial even within SoftBank, the newspaper reported.\n\nSoftBank declined to comment.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that SoftBank spent about $4 billion buying call options on stocks, while also selling call options at higher prices.\n\n \n\nThe idea that options buyers [could drive extreme rallies](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-04/option-traders-flex-market-muscles-with-focus-on-very-few-stocks) in technology stocks -- and push benchmark indexes to record highs -- would have drawn skepticism in the past. But as call volumes have exploded in stocks such as Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Tesla Inc., analysts are beginning to embrace the theory. They point out that traders could have outsize influence by concentrating their bets on a narrow set of high-profile names while other trading activity is reduced.\n\n\u201cIn a world where volumes are distorted by the frantic trading of algos, any real order flows may have surprisingly large impact on prices,\u201d Peter Tchir, head of macro strategy at Academy Securities, wrote in a note Tuesday. \u201cBy trading options, they leverage their position.\u201d\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-06/softbank-s-4-billion-trading-gains-on-u-s-stock-option-bet-ft](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-06/softbank-s-4-billion-trading-gains-on-u-s-stock-option-bet-ft)",
