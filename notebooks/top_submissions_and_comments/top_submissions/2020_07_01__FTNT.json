        "selftext": "Dear community,\n\nWhat is your opinion on CHKP? \nThey have earnings call on July 22 and current price is almost at the 52-week high. It is significantly cheaper (in terms of P/E) than the main competitors (PANW and FTNT). Indeed, it doesn't grow (in terms of revenue) like the other 2 competitors but it has net income margin of 40% which is a way higher than the the one of the others...I guess what could be the reason why FTNT and PANW are ahead of them in terms of price and prospects is because of the technology (more open to cloud based concepts) and customers ( small/medium/big enterprises) while CHKP traditionaly serves Telcos. Anyway, I believed that something has been changed during the COVID-19 and that CHKP has grown as the other two.",
