        "selftext": "Digital Storage is in everything. Cars, Cloud, Phones, PCs, Laptops. It's kinda odd this doesn't get shared more here, but hey this isn't the old WSB we're used to anymore. \n\nhttps://www.westerndigital.com/solutions/automotive-transportation\n\n&gt; The automotive and transportation industries are on the cusp of a disruptive technology phase. Vehicles are not simply mechanical engines but are now data centers on wheels, driving a new generation of storage infrastructure needs. As cars become connected and autonomous, massive amounts of data are being created and consumed. This requires new approaches in data processing that improve communications and interactions between humans and vehicles, vehicles and vehicles (V2V), and vehicles and infrastructures (V2I), while enabling a better and safer driving experience. This places massive demands on data storage and processing at the edge while pushing the boundaries of cloud-based services in the core.\n\nWhat we didn't expect was CHIA driving up the costs of traditional HDD storage. HD prices are going to end up going parabolic the way miners have strangled the shit out of the GPU space, driving gaming enthuiasts to desperation lengths and overpaying for GPUs. Just look at NVDA's price run over the last month.\n\nThe run-up for the storage sector is lagging but following the trend as Seagate (7/27) and WDC (7/28) prepare for ER next month. There will be a significant surge (5-10%) over the next week. Analysts have already lifted price targets; guessing this closes around $80 at the end of June. Easy weekly skimmings. \n\nWDC $75 6/18c",

        "selftext": "$WDC has good growth prospects due to a surge in HDD demand, and good earnings prospects.\n\nChia uses spare storage space on hard drives to verify transactions. This is considered to be the 'green' alternative to ASIC and GPUs. \n\n- Increased HDD demand:\n\nChia has gone up massively in recent months, driving a rush to purchase hard drives in order to mine it. As such, there have been hard drive shortages recently due to the increased demand. Much like GPU and semi-conductor stocks, we can expect good price action (and have already seen it) for hard drive manufacturer stocks. \n\n' \"In recent weeks the demand and pricing for high capacity [hard disk drives, or HDDs] has seen a material step higher ... and enterprise [solid state drive, or SSD] prices have also moved higher,\" analysts at Bank of America wrote in a Thursday report. The \"primary upside driver\" for that rising demand, according to BofA: chia. '\n\nWestern Digital is a market leader in the production of HDD's, producing some of the highest quality hard drives that have the best life expectancy, and a good warranty. As Chia transactions are very taxing on HDD's, buyers will be looking for the most durable hard drives. Which is why I am focusing my attention on Western Digital versus another stock such as Seagate. Western Digital is probably the best known manufacturer of hard drives, and usually a top choice for consumers. \n\n- Earnings:\n\nWestern Digital is also an attractive pick due to it's earnings outlook. Analysts are still raising their earnings estimates for the company. The growing optimism on earnings prospects are driving estimates higher, which should get reflected in its stock price.\n\nEarnings estimates for the next quarter and full year are increasingly being driven higher and higher. The company is likely to earn $1.46 per share for the current quarter, representing a change of +18.7%. Two estimates have moved higher in the past 30 days. For the full year, the company is expected to earn $3.83 per share, +25.99% over last year.  \n\n\nThe stock has gained 12.3% over the past four weeks. As earnings growth and the Chia frenzy are both likely to drive the stock higher -  in my opinion, it is a good buy, and I have added it to my portfolio.",

        "selftext": "Chia, a 'green' alternative to GPU mining has caused a global shortage of hard discs.

I expect as more people become aware of this, particularly in the West - it will lead to a shortage of hard discs and SSD's much like the current GPU shortage. There is already a shortage of HDD's/SSD's due to the initial surge of Chia interest causing a buyup of these items. However, as it gains traction, and as people realise how this is much more highly profitable in comparison to GPU mining currently - the demand will be similar to that of GPU's. \n\nThis initial surge I mention, has indeed already caused a surge in the stock prices.

Hard drive demand has already spiked leading to shortages.

        "selftext": "Hello. New to options. I've read multiple articles where closing an option is often the better choice than exercising it. However, crunching the numbers in the example below, it seems exercising is better? But perhaps I am mistaken...\n\nI bought one contract $STX 2 JUL 21 85 CALL at $2.4.  \n\nCurrent mark is $2.725 for open profit of $32.50\n\nCurrent price of stock is trading at 86.95. If I exercise and buy 100 shares at 85, then sell at 86.95, I profit $195. Read there is a TD option exercise fee of $19.99. So that will reduce profit down to $175.\n\nExercising (+$175) still seems more profitable than selling call option (+$32.50). Am I missing something (i.e. other fees, math wrong, incorrect info, etc.)? Thank you.",
