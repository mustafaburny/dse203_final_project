        "selftext": "Listen up retards. You ever want to play earnings for TSM, AMD, MU, Intel but can't choose which? What if I told you that you can play all of them, at the same damn time.\n\nVanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) is an index of the 25 largest semiconductor manufactures in the world. TSM, Intel, AMD, Texas Instruments, MU...you name it.\n\nThese two weeks are the time of the year when every company in the industry has their Q4 earnings. 10 out of the 25 companies in the index have earnings the next 2 weeks, accounting for 52% of the entire weighted average of the index.\n\nTSM, Intel, AMD, ASML, TXN, LRCX, XLNX, KLAC, STM and some others.\n\nThe semiconductor industry has been on fire, Q4 earnings are generally pumped up, the China deal on Wednesday will give a boost to the whole industry, and when paired with these earnings catalysts I see a bump coming through end of month. 1/31 calls look awfully tasty and are not expensive.",

        "selftext": " Analyzing a stock is a tedious and cognitive draining process at the quantitative level. To understand the company\u2019s track record, we often had to look at the financial statements (Income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statements) from past 10 years. Very often, we find ourselves cross-analyzing the different reports and across publications of different years to grasp the state the company. A smart investor would compile the 10-year data or find a website that provides it to make your analysis easier. Even so, the real work has only just started.\n\n**Analysing the stock**\n\nI used to find myself spending hours calculating the various ratios (current ratio, debt to equity ratio, etc) yourself as they are not provided. Frankly, I don\u2019t enjoy this process. Thereafter, you start mentally visualizing the inferring the following from the numbers.\n\n\\- Is the company operating more efficiently as it grows?\n\n\\- Is the debt growth outpacing its ability to generate cash?\n\n\\- Is the dividends payout sustainable?\n\n\\- Is the business generating desired level of ROI,ROA, or ROE?\n\n\\- What is the debt/equity structure of the company?\n\n**Valuating a stock**\n\nFor the retail investors without finance background, we ponder over the intrinsic value of the stock we love and sometimes pour our money into an over-valued stock. What use is the concept of margin of safety when you don\u2019t even know its intrinsic value? Even if you understand the approach to calculating the value using the different models, the calculation could take hours as it involves extraction of pertinent numbers from financial sites and financial reports, calculations, and double checking your math.\n\n**Solution**\n\nTo make analyzing easier, I have created a dashboard that visualize the data. Leave the number churning to me and visualization of the financial info to me. Let me put the past 10 years\u2019 data into perspective and calculate the intrinsic values for you while you research on the qualitative information from the annual reports and financial news sites. I will send you the PDF within 3 working days upon request. Here is a sample I have done for Apple (AAPL).\n\n***Link:*** [***https://www.dropbox.com/s/ge6788zpzuu4j8b/Apple.pdf?dl=0***](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ge6788zpzuu4j8b/Apple.pdf?dl=0)\n\nIf you find this service helpful, I am happy to inform you that I am selling the report at 10 USD per stock, and 150USD for 20 stocks. Payment shall be done through Paypal and coordinated through my dm.\n\n**Terms and condition**\n\n\\-The format for report is fixed. Customization of the format is subjected to price revision depending on the extent of the requested modification\n\n\\-Subsequent request for the same stock will be charged separately. Example for this scenario are: 1) Update of report to the latest year, 2) revaluation of stocks after share buyback or subsequent share offerings.\n\n(moderator, please let me know if it is inappropriate to post this pitch here. I will gladly remove this post if it violates the community practice. Thank you)",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve only been dabbling in invest for the past 12mths, and obviously with all the recession talk, China trade deal etc, I think everyone is a little nervous.\n\nBut ultimately I believe the world is becoming more of a cashless society, and it\u2019s so easy with mobile payments etc, I believe it\u2019s inevitable that this whole sector will sky rocket.\n\nI currently have positions in V , PYPL , SQ and taking more of a gamble on PAYS.\n\nI\u2019m looking for thoughts on  taking my positions in the above stocks noted, and investing in the IPAY ETF which would give me coverage on those stocks plus others like M, AXP, GPN, FIS, FISV, DFS and a few more?,\nOr Keep my individual stocks and add to my portfolio like M , GPN etc when or if they ever have a dip?\n\nAnd help would be greatly appreciated, cheers",
