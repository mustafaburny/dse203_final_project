        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI work in tech at a cloud computing company and have been researching investment opportunities. I recently came across Nutanix which is a company I've heard of but didn't realize was public. Nutanix is the industry leader in hyperconvered infrastructure (HCI) which essentially makes them a competitor to vmware, dell, cisco, etc. in the on-prem virtualization space. I was doing some reading and it seems like their products are highly regarded in the industry. I also noticed they are growing hybrid cloud  subscription services that can help customers abstract their cloud computing workloads away (AWS, GCP, Azure, on-prem can all be run from a single pane). I don't know exactly where the stand in this industry but evidently we are at peak cloud and large companies are starting to move workloads back out of the cloud to save money.\n\nThis company used to sell hardware but has recently undergone a transition into a subscription services company. This transition was painful and led to nearly no stock growth over 4 years. However with new leadership it looks like the company is pulling off the transition and starting to grow again.\n\nThey currently operate at a loss but according to the new leadership will be cash-flow positive sometime in 2022. currently the company has \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.64 Billion annual revenue\n\nAs of this quarter 19% YoY revenue growth\n\n83% annual recurring revenue\n\n7.7 billion market cap\n\na price/sales ratio of 5.5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\na Price to sales ratio of 5.5 for a subscription software company with 19% YoY revenue growth seems undervalued to me. I don't think wallstreet has priced in the companies transition to subscription hardware. \n\nAnybody have any insights or comments on this company?",

The Nasdaq (QQQ) is within 1% of its record-high, driven primarily by extreme strength in Tesla (TSLA), which became the sixth company to break $1 trillion market cap, and NVIDIA (NVDA), my personal favorite company which beasted to new all-time highs today. \n\nFollowing September\u2019s volatility, market participants have demonstrated their resilience and hunger to buy dips up despite ongoing supply-side disruptions and labor market imbalances, with new economic data showing consumer confidence increasing in October for the first time in four months. Investors continue to digest a massive week in regards to earnings, with mega-caps like AMD, Microsoft (MSFT), Visa (V), Alphabet (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN), among many others, reporting later this week.\n\nThe Conference Board, a non-profit business research organization, released their October monthly consumer confidence index, which showed confidence rising as coronavirus cases in the US continued to retreat from the latest spike.

The Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose to 113.8 in October from 109.8 in September.
