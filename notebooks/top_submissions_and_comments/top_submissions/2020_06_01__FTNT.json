        "selftext": "If you look at the Ferguson riots in August 2014, police body camera companies did extremely well.  The overall market actually went up as well, so those of you buying SPY puts chose incorrectly.\n\nAAXN went from $12 to $27 from August to December.  \nDGLY went from $3 to $25 in a few days after the riots.\n\nOut of these two, I prefer AAXN because they are more established.  These are short-term positions for me - perfect for trading FDs.\n\nAnonymous group is hacking everything right now and there is definitely a push for tighter net security.\n\nFTNT has great revenue growth (20%/year).  Increasing EPS and more importantly, increasing free cash flow to equity.  No debt.    \nCRWD has phenomenal revenue growth (109%/year) but it is a pretty new company.  Their subscription model leads to very sticky revenues and one of the few companies that is actually growing faster than ZM.  They also release earnings tomorrow and if they can hit over $185m for the quarter, I can see them shooting up.\n\nThese two are both larger term holds for me.  Do with this information as you will.",
