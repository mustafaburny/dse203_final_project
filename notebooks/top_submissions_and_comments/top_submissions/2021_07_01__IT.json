        "selftext": "Six fucking percent for a week of work.  That's what realtors want in this market.  3% for the buyer's agent, 3% for the seller's agent, and all they have to do is take some pictures and put that shit up on the internet.  It's galling.  You have a $500k house and want to sell it?  Well, not without paying $30k to some shithead with an MLS account!  And it only gets more galling the richer you get.  The transaction cost on buying and selling homes is just really, really fucking high when you use an agent.\n\nAnd Zillow knows this, and they know people are sick of paying realtors $3,000-$10,000 per hour to sell their homes.  \n\nToday, I just sold an investment property to Zillow.  They offered me the Zestimate (their own pricing model which is publicly available on their website), which is great because it's how I valued my house anyway.  People are always on Zillow looking to see what shit costs, and they just offered me what they said the house was worth. \n\nThey charged me about $10k in seller concessions to for repairs and shit, which is higher than you might pay normally, but this is directly in line with my own estimations for what I would have needed to do to sell the house.\n\nFinally, they charges .1%.  POINT ONE PERCENT as a transaction cost.  So at the end of the day, I got exactly the price I expected, I didn't have to deal with anybody's bullshit (buyers, agents, showings, cleanings, contractors, staging, pictures) and I basically did the whole thing online.\n\nTheir tech is also very good.  Smooth docusigning, good customer service, even remote/Zoom notary services.  \n\nThey are going to spruce this house up and then they are going to sell it on their own platform to another buyer.  Even if they don't make a profit, what they just did is FUCK TWO TO FOUR REALTORS out of their commissions.  \n\nIt's like Sony taking a loss on their hardware to get market share.  This is how Zillow is going to win.  It was easier and cheaper and I dont' feel slightly fucked.  But realtors are fucked.  I think Z has earnings on 8/5.  I'm thinking about an option play but I don't know.  My wife bought like 15k of their stock for a long term hold in her roth, so that's all we've got for now.  What do you think?",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m just an autist that wants to help my fellow dudes make money. Have I been guilty of this in the past? Absolutely. In my post history you\u2019ll definitely find me shilling for CLOV. Stupid piece of shit CLOV. \n\nTurns out, you\u2019ll find most of these stocks are shorted FOR A REASON. THEY SUCK ASS. THINK YOU DAMN APES, THINK. \n\nAMC and GME actually did squeeze. But those are RARE exceptions. And they totally poisoned this sub with a bunch of Neanderthals looking for the next short squeeze. Stop. Get help. It feels like we\u2019ve had 5 years worth of short squeezes in the last few months. It\u2019s over. \n\nWhy should you listen to a random nobody yelling at you on the internet? Because. People are making money out there while you baghold these crap stocks. SPY at an all time high. You coulda made more $$ playing Microsoft or Apple. \n\nOr actually, don\u2019t stop. Lose your money please. And then fuck off to your lonely 9-5 daily cocksucking for that $500 weekly paycheck. And never come to this sub again. So I don\u2019t have to read your bullshit. I just want to wake up, pull out my phone, and not see your dumb ass. Your wife/girlfriend however is invited. \n\nSo, want to know why your \u201cshort squeeze\u201d DD isn\u2019t working?! Here\u2019s the difference- AMC and GME are household names. If you want retail to pile on? It\u2019s gotta be a household name. Retail loves nostalgia. They love familiarity. \n\nSo is it a retail squeeze, or can you get the big bois on board? Here\u2019s some facts for ya- they don\u2019t need your shit DD. They have Bloomberg Terminals. They have 100x more data than we do, and they see it before we do, in real time, and they play market rotations and earnings. They\u2019re not googling 1 week old short interest data. They got the real time shit. They play this game on another level. And if you can\u2019t get them on board, and the stock isn\u2019t a household name, then you fucked up. \n\nSo this is what I\u2019m saying- I blame all you fucks for missing plays like NKE last week. \n\nCome on. NKE was a fucking given. It was written on the wall in neon letters and most of us missed it. \n\nTL;DR- want to make money? You can be a millionaire without ever touching a short squeeze. \n\nFucking rookie ass bitches.",

        "selftext": "Alright you retards, I'm taking the initiative to clear the air. I'm probably going to get a lot of downvotes, but I'm going to be straight up honest here.\n\nWe are not a team, this is not a cult, and this is not fucking collusion.\n\nGME, AMC, &amp; CLOV are three completely different plays. Stop fucking comparing the 3 with this cult like attitude.\n\n**GME** \\- Was being shorted because as per \"technicals\" it was a company that was going to shit (bankruptcy) if they didn't change leadership and incorporate strategic changes to their business model aka E-Commerce and the like. Additionally, the biggest reason GME picked up is in late December/early January is because it had a ridiculous/unprecedented short interest of %140. Making the short squeeze extremely likely to occur. The stock picked up, gamma squeeze and short squeezes occurred and it's still the play to this day. Why? because the remaining \\~15-20% short sellers still holding their positions are the same ones from the beginning who have accumulated billions in loses, thus still considered a major play + the company making big changes to their board of directors, adding e-commerce and more etc.\n\n**AMC** \\- This stock sucked dick when it was first picked up. The only reason this stock got picked up was because of nostalgia and because of people missing out on GME. The SI% on AMC back when GME rallied up was well below 20%. This company as well was on the verge of bankruptcy. It got picked up by the supporters like us apes and more shorts loaded in. AMC due to the retail investors \"Picking\" this stock to rally up actually has started to work on their business model and accrued $1B in investments and has started to really concentrate on building the business into a success (hopefully). When the CEO said the talks of bankruptcy are no longer on the table, is because even they knew at the time that filing for bankruptcy was a real possibility for the company. Again, the CEO has fucked over investors in the past by trying to continually dilute the float with adding more shares. On top of that prior to the stocks rallying up the board and CEO's paid themselves handsomely when the company was about to fail. Now, the narrative is different for AMC as the shorts that are in this stock are the same ones from the beginning and have also accrued unrealized losses. Also, seems the company has really pivoted to reconstruct their business model to become a success once COVID-19 is no longer hindering the world from being normal again, thus, making AMC still a very big play.\n\n**CLOV** \\- Was ridiculously shorted the moment it hit IPO. This had nothing to do with GME or AMC. The short interest on CLOV has been there since IPO. The play for CLOV is that it's a Medicare Advantage Disruptor, and provides a real use case and a cost effective solution to the traditional Medicare Advantage sub-segment that hasn't changed in ages. This stock has a large short interest, now probably greater then AMC and GME combined, low float, no debt, and has a very bright future for growth. It's also heavily invested by Alphabet (Google) and other major players. The firms shorting CLOV are not the same as those who shorted GME and AMC, separate that from your minds.\n\nYes, Melvin Capital, Citadel and others targeted GME and AMC, but this has no relevance to CLOV. No one gives a fuck, a viable stock that has a potential to disrupt a market segment that is also heavily shorted is the play for CLOV. That's it, simple as that.\n\nAll 3 of these stocks are completely different plays. Yes, a short squeeze and/or gamma squeeze will always be appreciated on any stock. But get this through your heads, THEY ARE NOT THE SAME PLAY! They are completely different in respect to each other.\n\nWSB is a casino, we're here to place bets and hope for the best. This is not a team sport, this is not a cult, and this is not collusion. \n\nIf you don't like a stock, then don't throw money at it. But stop with the shilling and the cult attitude predominantly from GME and AMC diehards that can't grasp that WSB is a casino and not a subreddit solely about GME or AMC. (I'm not talking about GME and AMC holders as a whole, most of you are chill af, just some that are constantly shilling everything with a ticker thats not GME or AMC).\n\nNow with this shit said, I'm a big supporter of all 3. But for fuck sakes they are not the same play, stop comparing the 3.\n\nDon't forget AMC dropped to $6 and AMC bagholders were bag holding for months before it moved. GME dropped to $40 and GME holders were bag holding for months before it moved. \n\nEveryone needs to chill the fuck out, play your plays and keep it moving. Stop shilling shit and comparing shit when they're not correlated at all.\n\nBB and NOK became \"Meme\" stocks because fundamentally, they were undervalued for what the company actually does and where they're positioning themselves for the future. \n\nPeople just need to stop comparing and having these debates. 3 stocks, 3 completely different plays, fuck off and throw your money at which ever stocks you like and hope for the best, just stop with the comparisons and cult shit it's ridiculous.\n\nAlso, the short squeeze is nowhere near in sight. You think the short sellers are dumb as fuck? They're going to wait until inflation hits and fucks up the whole market. They're probably betting that once the market goes tits up, people bag holding these stocks will sell, why? Because they anticipate people will need to pay for bills, mortgages/rent, their children etc, and with the cost of living, cost of commodities inflating due to inflation, I can easily see how they're going to hold onto there positions (shorting these stocks) until this occurs. They're banking that when shit goes tits up, the investors in these stocks will also go tits up and FUD will kick in causing massive selloffs. (My personal opinion).\n\nSome plays on WSB are value plays, short squeeze plays, gamma squeeze plays, undervalued plays, oversold plays, etc the fucking list goes on.\n\nWSB is a god damn casino, so treat it as such. I wish you all the best and many tendies, regardless of what you're invested in. Downvote me to oblivion, idaf.\n\nCheers,",

        "selftext": "**TL;DR: Almost all the key signs that caused the housing market crash in 2008 are back stronger than ever. Mortgage debt is at ATH, consumer debt is 2x higher than ever, lumber futures are down 60% but physical lumber isn't moving, unemployment is still 50% higher than in 2009, housing starts are double what they were in 2008, and median house prices just broke $300,000 for the first time ever, inflation adjusted. All of which are bearish indicators for the economy. Houses r fuk**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1.) Mortgage Debt and Consumer Debt is at an All Time High**\n\nHaving high mortgage debt makes your house a debt and not an asset. It is sitting right above **10 billion dollars.** If it goes any higher, we are at an extreme risk for higher foreclosures. However, consumer debt may be a greater issue. It is currently nearing **2x what it was in 2008.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.newyorkfed.org\\/microeconomics\\/hhdc.html](https://preview.redd.it/rhy0xeife3b71.png?width=1291&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31eedce488849fd4b9c956a4fea74ecb0cda4881)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2.) Lumber Futures Have Fallen, Physical Has Not**\n\nAnother way to tell if we are in a bubble is by comparing the futures market to actual prices. When there is a large gap in these two, it usually indicates people are still willing to pay much higher prices for a large supply. It doesn't make any economical sense. People still feel that lumber is in extremely high demand, and will buy lumber (which isn't in high demand), and buy as much as they can anticipating the price to continue going up. It's artificial price increases.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.nasdaq.com\\/market-activity\\/commodities\\/lbs](https://preview.redd.it/2z24wwlmf3b71.png?width=1002&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a326e28b9e16725f41c0df7375d549441afeb22d)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3.) Unemployment is Still Extremely High After COVID Restrictions Lifted**\n\nUnemployment numbers are still 50% higher than they were in 2019. There's no reason to go back to work for \\~2% of the population, because the stimulus checks and unemployment add up to more than minimum wage. This money has to come from somewhere, a.k.a money printing. This in turn adds up to more inflation, which is my next point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.macrotrends.net\\/1316\\/us-national-unemployment-rate](https://preview.redd.it/6nxq3o6lg3b71.png?width=1079&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a33a45e21fbb24f61bd30f779b8ca38280b2af86)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[BRRRRRRR](https://i.redd.it/9gi3ygssg3b71.gif)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4.) Inflation is the Highest it has been in 31 Years**\n\nJpow, our lord and savior, announced today inflation was above expectations of 5%. This has not happened since 1990. Hmm. [AP article](https://apnews.com/article/inflation-economy-government-and-politics-business-3539110d1ebe308e6aa11b3e1ca77c9e#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20(AP)%20%E2%80%94%20The%20economy,at%20a%20congressional%20oversight%20hearing)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.macrotrends.net\\/2497\\/historical-inflation-rate-by-year](https://preview.redd.it/htltaykaj3b71.png?width=1111&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ac29899854ff5c947344c1634c14c0a0ba1c19f)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5.) Housing Starts are Double What They Were in 2008, Nearing 2005 (Peak) Levels**\n\nHousing starts measure how many houses are being built. It is currently at around 1,500 a month. They are still recovering from 2005 but quickly approaching 2005 levels. More houses being built means that there is more supply flowing in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.macrotrends.net\\/1314\\/housing-starts-historical-chart](https://preview.redd.it/q6rimkr2l3b71.png?width=1052&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=669ba69ad13396b8b0ef5b9a2fa0a6e95df02c84)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**6.) Median House Prices are at $300,000, Up Nearly 100% From 2012**\n\nAlthough the housing crisis ended around 2009, the bottom for housing prices was in 2012. Since then, housing prices are well above their 2008 levels, even adjusted for inflation. This is a bad sign for the housing market. Having high housing prices means more debt, which leads to more defaults.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/dqydj.com\\/historical-home-prices\\/](https://preview.redd.it/da8skqgxl3b71.png?width=725&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e630b436031fea554fe587ee362c8df29136d43)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**7.) 30 Year Fixed Mortgages are at an All Time Low**\n\nThis is not necessarily a bad sign for the housing economy, but it means if we were to have a recession, it could be really bad. To fix recessions, the fed usually lowers interest rates, which is like turning the economy off and on again. It works most of the time. The grey bars in this picture are recessions. Notice how about halfway through each recession, the interest rates decrease, and the recession shortly ends.\n\nInterest rates are already incredibly low, so this may not be an option for the next recession without making interest rates negative. Having negative interest rates triggers more panic buying houses people can't afford, which results in more defaults. It will quickly become a chain reaction of hell.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.macrotrends.net\\/2604\\/30-year-fixed-mortgage-rate-chart](https://preview.redd.it/txtovqi5n3b71.png?width=1091&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=245b5c47fe23bb69b6753ee2eb6b399dcc6e5e6a)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is my first DD, hopefully it's decent.

        "selftext": "So I made this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oe9ruu/how_to_play_the_upcoming_market_crash/) and a lot of you have been asking, both in the comments and messages, about why I think the housing market is fucked and bubbly and primed for a crash.  There's a bunch of reasons I'll get to shortly, but first lets take a little trip down memory lane to 2000-2001 in California when there were a bunch of rolling energy blackouts.\n\nIn 2000, California was getting hit with blackouts and high prices, power companies were failing, and it seemed like the crisis came out of nowhere.  I remember watching this on the news and being confused as to how Cali had power for all their stuff last week, but not this week, and all the press talked about how this was the new normal and people needed to get used to it/stop using so much power/people were too greedy with AC, etc. etc.  Then there was this one guy who came out and said Gov. Gray Davis should send the National Guard to seize the power plants and keep them on.  Everyone pointed and laughed at the crazy conspiracy guy.  Except, here's the kicker.  Crazy conspiracy guy was 100% right.  Enron was shutting down power plants to drive up demand and cause artificial shortages to make money.  When the blackouts and price spikes were happening, Cali had 45GW of installed power, and demand was running at 28GW.  Fuckery was afoot.\n\nSo, whenever I see something that doesn't make sense in any kind of market, I always wonder, is there a reason for this?  Or is it Fuckery?  Let's talk about the current boom in housing prices and why I suspect Fuckery.\n\nAll data is taken from the Fed and the US Census Bureau.  I left off decimals wherever possible because I know my audience can't do that kind of fancy math.\n\nIn 2004 (roughly the peak of US homeownership rates) the US homeownership rate was a bit over 69%.  In 2021 it's at 65%.  In 2004 there were 122 million housing units in the US.  In 2021 it's 141 million.  US population in 2004 was 292 million.  In 2021 it's 331 million.  Throw all these numbers into a blender and you get:\n\nA 13% increase in population, a 4% decrease in homeownership rate, and a 15% increase in housing supply.  Yes, that's right, the housing supply has increased faster than the population, and the homeownership rate during that time has dropped.  So where the fuck is this crazy demand coming from?  \n\nAre people making more money?  Nope.  Workers share of corporate income has fallen from 79% in 2004 to 77% in 2021.  So in real terms wages are down.  \n\nIs it immigrants?  Nope, immigration has been falling for years.  \n\nIs it young people starting families?  Nope, family formation is close to all time lows and the oldest millennials who are approaching 40, are 20% poorer than boomers were at their age.\n\nIs it inflation?  Nope, bond yields are currently signaling deflation, but the bond market has been wonky as fuck all year so who really knows.  \n\nSo basically you've got more supply relative to population, construction of new units is slowing down - 1.8 million starts in Jan to 1.7 million starts in March down to 1.6 million starts in May, prices are rising, and sales are slowing.  Jan 6.5 million existing home sales, 993,000 new home sales.  May 5.8 million existing home sales, 769,000 new home sales.\n\nSo, to recap for the slower folks in the helmets on the short bus with the flavored windows:\n\n**Prices: Up.  Wages: Down.  Supply relative to population: Up.  Demand: Down.  Sales: Down. Construction: Down.**\n\nYeah, it's a fucking bubble.  And clearly, Fuckery is Afoot.  Who is doing the fuckery and why I don't know.  Maybe it's Chinese nationals trying to get money out of the CCP's control, maybe it's AirBnB, maybe it's Blackrock and REIT ETF's, maybe it's something else entirely, but it's definitely a bubble, and it's definitely Fuckery.\n\n**TLDR: Fuckery is Afoot.  It's a bubble.  Don't buy a house until the market crashes.  And remember, millions of units are waiting to come on the market once evictions start up again.**\n\nPositions, same as the last post, puts on HYG because there are a lot of bullshit zombie companies that should have died years ago but are propped up by index investing and cheap corporate debt that the FED keeps buying, calls on SPXS because when this thing pops it's going to explode like nothing seen before to the point where Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster are going to sit around roasting marshmallows on the dumpster fire that used to be the stock market.\n\nOne last nugget about housing?  Residential Fixed Investment (it's a recession indicator, the acronym is apparently a banned ticker) was declining before the COVID crash, we were actually just starting a normal recession when that hit, which caused the FED to hit the panic button on the money printer.  On a 30 year or more chart SPY has been vertical since the COVID bottom.  Vertical lines in an index on a long term chart like that generally indicate the euphoria phase that precedes a massive crash.\n\nMy date range remains unchanged, sometime between June and November of this year.  If you want some specific dates to watch, check July 12th, July 19th, August 23rd, September 20th, and October 25th.  I probably like August 23rd the most of those, but I buy retard positions on WSB, so you definitely shouldn't listen to me.",

        "selftext": "I thought I had a brilliant, fool proof strategy that the market didn't know and I was first to discover but I was wrong.\n\nThe strategy:  Find weekly options deep out of the money that yield at least 0.5% of the capital requirement. The shot strike price must be below the 200 moving day average and you leverage up to get decent premiums.\n\nI started this in May 2021 selling deep out of the money TSLA naked puts. Then I realized this uses too much margin, so I learnt about credit spreads but I didn't act on it. Then came big tech earnings week and I decided to lay low and not trade at all, but then my tool scanned and found the AMZN deep out of the money puts are yielding similar returns to TSLA, which is basically almost impossible to find in the market unless it's something like AMC or other meme stocks.\n\nI decided to pull the trigger, so I sold 3280 shot, and bought 3200 long on 7/28 expiring 7/30. AMZN was trading north of 3650. I was certain it wouldn't drop 10% or even get close.\n\nWell after hours happened and I paniced, my life flashed before me, I had levered up $525000 in my account, and I also had levered up my wife's account for $280,000 for a total of $800,000.\n\nThis wasn't a YOLO, it wasn't a double my money scheme. I was thinking I could do this 52 weeks in a year, collect 0.5% yield on $800,000 of collateral and move to Hawaii.\n\nIt didn't work out like that. When the markets opened, I got out of the position with $76K of damage, and wiped out all my gains and then some, but I'm thankful to everyone who helped me here on reddit (elsewhere) and WSB discord, and of course my wife who when she found out we'd lose $800,000 just said, don't worry at least we'll be together.\n\nSo cautionary tale for those selling levered up bull put credit spreads and/or naked TSLA puts, those black swan events you don't think you can get close to ... well you can.",

        "selftext": "   \nI was forced to post this DD because I feel like there has not been enough posts on this sub about the coming housing crash and how we should all be afraid. \n\nYou may be asking, how I know this? \n\nWell, for one thing, this house in my neighborhood had to be put on sale recently because clearly no one would buy it at regular price:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/49w70rkepgb71.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f8ab1471945f0589a0a596ef59016be0746ec65\n\nAlso there is no lumber shortage, as evidenced by all this lumber I recently saw (on bing images):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1phh25ojpgb71.png?width=1438&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d23d9271b1ffb16fd5a56dbf53112159c4513878\n\nPlus, as we saw in during the great depression, things that are expensive always get cheaper. For example: lambos (my next DD will be about the lambo crash). Here\u2019s a picture of mine:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lktypjqupgb71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c6ac063c69d0824702b3b9104828cbaaa572b6d\n\nNow, some of you might be saying this DD lacks any technical analysis or numbers for that matter.

Final question, when will it all crash and burn? Tomorrow or next year, 2040 at the latest. Any other questions? Ask your mom. \n\nDisclosures: \n\n1. I\u2019m not a financial advisor, but I did watch Big Short for the 12th time last night and jizzed my pants while air drumming to Metallica and pretending that I was Michael Burry. \n2. That house is not in my neighborhood but the sign is real so fuck you\n3. The lambo is not mine, but it will be after the lambo crash of 2025. \n4. Positions: I have a opened a short position on my neighbor Larry\u2019s 3/2 1800 SF because Larry is a douchebag and who needs 2 bathrooms?",

        "selftext": "And, to top it off, the CCP is now discussing scrapping the Variable Interest Entity (VIE) structure through which foreign investors have \"invested\" in Chinese companies. [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ofexp9/china\\_considers\\_closing\\_loophole\\_used\\_by\\_tech/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ofexp9/china_considers_closing_loophole_used_by_tech/)\n\n(For a primer on the VIE structure and the risks it poses to American and other foreign investors looking to invest in China, see here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuhibq/wallstreetsbets\\_getting\\_infiltrated\\_by\\_ccp/gisa27x/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuhibq/wallstreetsbets_getting_infiltrated_by_ccp/gisa27x/?context=3) )\n\nWonder if American and other foreign investors will \\*finally\\* get the memo with Didi here. If the CCP wanted American and foreign investors to lose the maximum right out of the gate, they could not have timed this move any better. The SEC requires publicly traded companies to disclose substantial risks to the company\u2019s operations or business. Is there any credible evidence to suggest Didi execs were completely unaware the app was at risk of an imminent shutdown when the company filed its 10-K?\n\nSomeone lied. It's either the CCP or Didi itself (which, let's be honest, is likely little more than an alter ego for the CCP anyways, given the usual governmental presence required on boards and the like).\n\nThis lack of reciprocity cannot continue. The US government cannot and should not let Chinese companies list here unless they meet the same disclosure requirements that American companies meet under the prevailing securities acts and implementing regulations. Foreign investors in China must have access to the Chinese courts to litigate securities fraud actions, just as happens here on the flipside in the US (recall that Huawei/CCP was able to judicially challenge the Trump Administration's proposed ban in American court).\n\nUnless and until that happens, the lesson is clear: stay away from Chinese offerings. The CCP shows once again it has absolutely no qualms about deceiving and pulling the rug on foreign investors. This is definitely part of a larger pattern of the CCP flexing on foreign investors (see here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kptiml/rip\\_jack/gi0cl58/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kptiml/rip_jack/gi0cl58/); [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kp3cg3/tsla\\_gang\\_heavy\\_sigh\\_of\\_relief\\_dont\\_want\\_to\\_get/ghuxevt/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kp3cg3/tsla_gang_heavy_sigh_of_relief_dont_want_to_get/ghuxevt/)). The risk is just not worth it. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o92524/why\\_nio\\_will\\_be\\_the\\_next\\_apple\\_and\\_the\\_leader\\_of/h38v0qm/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o92524/why_nio_will_be_the_next_apple_and_the_leader_of/h38v0qm/)\n\nINB4:\n\n1. Enron, Theranos, Your Hometown Deli, Lordstown, et al. Besides the fact Enron was decades ago, it spawned disclosure and accounting laws that American companies now must comply with. But more to the point, with respect to all of these, the US has securities fraud laws to protect investors here; if they've been injured, and lies or fraudulent statements were made, then the offending company can be haled into court to answer for it, \\*including\\* by foreigners who invested in them. Theranos, like Enron, has even spawned a criminal process in addition to the civil one.\n\nTell me: do you, as a foreigner, have the right to demand a judicial remedy in Chinese court against the CCP or a SOE for, e.g., fraudulently rugpulling the VIE structure? Do you, as a foreign investor, have the right to hale Luckin Coffee into Chinese court for securities fraud?\n\nThere is no reciprocity. And that's the nub of the problem. As a foreign investor in China, you will get burned, and \\*there is nothing you can do about it\\* (unlike foreign investors here in the US).\n\n2. Ohh, silly person, China wouldn't shoot itself in the foot and injure its standing in the world by bilking foreign investors and taking all their money, leaving them high and dry. Recall the National Security Law and Hong Kong, in violation of a treaty the CCP signed. The CCP more likely envisions itself as Bruce Willis in this scene from Die Hard 4: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHT2zdQT3Ps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHT2zdQT3Ps) . Yes, it injures itself, but it weakens or takes out its foreign competition in the process. The CCP has shown time and again it's more concerned above all else with consolidating its power. It is better to reign in Hell than to serve in Heaven.",

Give me a thesis I haven\u2019t heard before if you\u2019re throwing out a blue chip.\n* Please don\u2019t throw out something like PLUG.

Why 10 years? The idea of \u201cefficient market hypothesis\u201d is misunderstood. It\u2019s really \u201caverage weighted market participant\u201d, and guess what...every market participant is in the game for a different reason. Some folks are in it for the YOLO, some are just trying to keep up with inflation, and most (asset managers) are simply trying to earn a good end-of-year bonus. I don\u2019t have a chance in hell beating the market on **their time-frame**, but I think I have a good shot of beating it on **my time-frame** if I buy and hold solid companies with patience on my side.\n\nFundamental DD isn\u2019t what I\u2019m looking for, I assume the market has already priced that in. **Tell me what the market isn\u2019t pricing in**. Also give me the bear case. I\u2019ll start this off with the most eccentric stuff in my book...\n\n**Alleghany Corp (Y)**\n\nI just really love the management of this re-insurance company. They don\u2019t \u201cplay Warren Buffet\u201d and invest in the stock market. Instead they invest in private companies, with an eye towards durable moats...companies that can\u2019t easily lose their position to Amazon or foreign competitors. Investments include AFCO Steel LLC (steel erection) &amp; Jazware Toys (maker of Pokemon &amp; AEW action figures). This is the management team that had the foresight to buy a private **FUNERAL** company while the corona-virus epidemic was raging.\n\nBull: COVID &amp; severe weather (winter storm) losses really took it\u2019s toll on the industry. Alleghany and others took significant underwriting losses. I see this as a positive going forward, because demand and pricing-power on re-insurance is likely be in an uptrend for the foreseeable future especially as severe climate events become the norm.  \n\nBear: Climate change is a double-edged sword. More frequent severe weather is a good thing, because that improves demand/pricing-power...but the risk of massive black-swan event is always there.\n\n**Restaurant Brands International (QSR)**\n\nI nearly decided not to include this as they are a blue-chip, but mutual funds and asset managers HATE QSR. Their financials are uninspiring and generally they have a reputation on the street for \u201cnot being well-managed.\u201d My take is that management is playing the long game rather than focusing on keeping the analysts happy...\n\nBull: If you\u2019ve ever walked around Wall St., one thing is for certain...those managers have not eaten in one of those restaurants in years. Asset managers are in love with YUM Brands\u2019 margin expansion yet ignoring that their food quality is going down the tubes. Meanwhile QSR has been playing the opposite game, stepping up their quality in Burger King and Tim Horton\u2019s especially. The market is also under-appreciating the global expansion potential of Popeyes and Burger King. Indians love the veggie burger, and China loves fried chicken. Global expansion was put on hold due to corona-virus but is going to resume.\n\nBear: Tim Hortons. Their quality has vastly improved but brand-damage already took its toll, will take years to repair the reputation. Work-from-home conditions are going to hurt this line-of-business for the foreseeable future.\n\n**Freyr (FREY)**\n\nBull: Not just another lithium-ion SPAC. This one is out of Norway and even had a show of support from Erna Solberg (Norwegian prime minister). Energy is cheap there thanks to wind/hydro and  Freyr provides a rare opportunity for Norwegians to get a job at a promising upstart.\n\nBear: This is the biggest risk on my book. They are literally starting from scratch. No manufacturing capability expected for several years. They are currently hiring w/ the funds from their IPO. My main thesis is that Norwegians don\u2019t generally pull pump-and-dump schemes like in the US. This can grow big or go to $0 if mismanaged.\n\n**Ingridions (INGR)**\n\nBull:  While everyone is distracted with Beyond Meat, industry dinosaur INGR has been not-so-secretly pivoting towards plant protein manufacturing. Just recently they\u2019ve opened the first US plant that focuses exclusively on plant-based protein isolates and teaming with Clara Foods on egg protein alternatives. They\u2019re plant-protein investments are expected to continue accelerating with nearly $200 million in investments planned.\n\nBear: High-fructose corn syrup. While the company has been diversifying their portfolio to include stevia, starches, and beer brewing ingredients, HFCS is still a major part of their business, and it continues to get a bad rep despite that Ingridion\u2019s corn syrup is likely more environmentally sustainable than cane sugar. Ingridion has not been able to win the perception war on HFCS and will need to keep finding new revenue streams to make up for stale demand in sweeteners.\n\n**NiSource, Inc (NI)**\n\nBull: Renewable energy investments are their biggest growth driver. While green energy eyes are focusing on cars, folks don\u2019t realize **utility** **workers** are going to be the muscle behind the energy revolution. I\u2019m looking towards a near-future where the political atmosphere recognizes this and accordingly green-lights the investments that are going to need to be made.\n\nTheir business model is also very resilient...this is a company that literally blew up 80 homes in Massachusetts, survived the lawsuit and ended with a stronger all-time high a year later. Currently trading (along many other utilities) at way below their pre-corona highs despite a near record-high spread between their dividend and treasury yield.\n\nBear: It\u2019s a regulated utility company. Political constraints are going to cap their upward potential.\n\n**IAMGold (IAG)**\n\nBull: Their stock has been beaten down after something like eight years of red tape, and now they\u2019ve finally broken ground on their Cote Mine in Quebec. I had to pay attention because Justin Trudeau himself attending the ground-breaking ceremony. Company has practically zero debt and a price to book of around 0.6. They are literally worth more than the gold they are sitting on. I don\u2019t think gold bugs realize the benefit of having a mine in Canada. If gold ever does reach $3000, good luck getting it out of a 3rd world country without paying bribes.\n\nBear: This company needs a strong gold price. Canadian labor is expensive: gold needs to fetch a good price to make mining profitable. A lot is riding on Cote and there\u2019s always the risk it could end up a bust.\n\n**Cal Maine Foods (CALM)**\n\nBull: Eggs are currently selling at near inflation adjusted lows (measured over 30+ years). It\u2019s practically never been cheaper to eat eggs, while per-capita consumption is on uptrend. Sooner or later the hope is that margins will improve, especially as demand for cage free increases. Cal-Maine is currently trading with a depressed price yet very high PE due to continued investment in growth, especially cage-free (these sell at larger margins). I see this as an investment that will pay off in 5+ years.\n\nBear: Literally all you need to compete with them is to buy a rooster and some hens. Egg industry pricing power remains weak.\n\n**Graftech (EAF)**\n\nI\u2019m usually not into very cheap but this company is very cheap. 7 PE. EAF is a Brookfield turnaround story. It\u2019s understood that they were mismanaged before Brookfield came in, cleaned things up, and improved efficiency/margins. Stock has been a bear since Brookfield IPO\u2019d it, as it\u2019s obvious the purpose of the IPO is just so that Brookfield could cash in on their original investment. BIG insider selling by Brookfield has not finished yet and it remains an anchor around the stock price. Fortunately however Brookfield has already trimmed down to own &lt; 25% of the company...so there\u2019s a bit more to go but the insider selling drag is likely to be over soon.\n\nBull: The steel industry is responsible for roughly 5% of all global carbon emissions. There\u2019s currently no other way to produce low-carbon steel other than recycling steel scrap. EAF is the largest US manufacturer of graphite electrodes: the heating element used in the furnace to melt down and recycle steel. Right now there isn\u2019t any political \u201cpush\u201d to increase recycled steel demand, and \u201cmade in USA\u201d has so far been an empty promise, but I expect real political push for both will come in a few years.\n\nBear: China. Industry speculation is that China is building up several times the capacity to build graphite electrodes...although speculation is also that quality will not be a good. It remains to be seen if Chinese firms are doing this for domestic consumption only (China wants to go green too). It also remains to be seen if Chinese output will be able to keep up with or exceed recycled steel demand.",

        "selftext": "Due to recent events, it is with a heavy heart that I must inform you that I am resigning as a moderator on r/wallstreetbets.\n\nI would like to write this as my final post and clarify my side of the story. But first, a little about me:\n\nAt the age of 16 I joined the French Foreign Legion (FFL). Throughout my time in the FFL, I served in many theaters and battles. One in particular, the Battle of North Sentinel Island, I was captured by Yakuza operatives and became a prisoner of war. I managed to escape and was awarded the Buerre de Cacahu\u00e8tes au Poisson distinction for heroism ([pictured](https://preview.redd.it/eyindthb0bc71.png?width=577&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0bcdcc7fedbb3941f632e66274d67144e3c69b4b)), the highest honor one can receive in the FFL. I never wanted to be a hero. Alas, we cannot choose our own fate. After my discharge from the FFL, I was recruited by the Canadian government as a contractor to head their electronic surveillance unit mainly focused on their efforts to topple the Canadian Eco-terrorist Organization known as the Castor en Colere Liberation Front.  I served honorably alongside u/opinion_is_unpopular. We shared many nights in the tundra huddled by the campfire in our beaver skin tunics sharing war stories over bowls of poutine, as is tradition.  Despite all of the wonderful things I have personally done single-handedly to improve the world, I pride myself on being a humble man. Currently, I am an entrepreneur and run 4 businesses. DM me for my ETSY link. What does any of this have to do with moderating you ask? Well, nothing.\n\nThe actions of the past week are inexcusable. I must apologize to the community for allowing myself to be honey-potted by u/memetron9000. What started off as friendly banter on our side project r/RunicCocksElite, quickly evolved into much more. It got pretty serious, as we would discuss the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model deep into the night. One thing led to another and he was soon sending feet pics.  Little did I know the FUD he would unleash on this community after I allowed him to become a moderator.\n\nThe screenshots that were shared are true. They were taken from a private conversation I had with u/fannypackphantom discussing my past membership in a cannibal coven practicing Juju magic in Sierra Leone. I first met fanny over Twitter and we bonded over a tweet I made regarding the socioeconomic implications of a woman shopping at Duluth Traders for her wardrobe needs.   She was very accepting of my cannibalistic past and I felt comfortable sharing intimate details. Casual conversations amongst what I thought was a friend has now come back to haunt me now that I am a celebrity.\n\nFurthermore, it was I who modded u/pokimane. This is significant because the MSM media would like you to believe that Covid-19 caused the March 2020 recession when in fact it was her appointment as a moderator of r/wallstreetbets that served as the catalyst. Please do not harass her, she is not a Shill.  We have conducted extensive research into her background, mannerisms, and idiosyncrasies and can confirm this. u/zjz has also deployed his shill sniffing bot with negative results. Unfortunately, this has triggered a crippling addiction to her Twitch stream and has rendered him more financially desperate than even most of you poors.\n\nI have done everything in my power to serve this community. Heroic actions such as deleting the unrelenting barrage of trash memes posted by u/throwaway1forall, banning 99% of people who play flair or ban, and encouraging u/yolocallking to include more Brazilian bundas in his memes are just a small sample of the personal sacrifices I have made.\n\nI know so many of you hate me and honestly, fine. I am use to that. I am a Juju practitioner, Heterosexual, wonderful, famous, and amazing. I have always been this way and I am not ashamed of who I am. Had I still been the old Sdevil with the autists at my side, I\u2019d have endured it and risked my life for the community, like I have so many times before. However, I see no reason to risk it and I will resign effective July 21, 2045. In the interim, I will be at r/RunicCocksElite awaiting the arrival of u/sloptart69 in order to apprentice in the ancient ritual of sugar water immersion.\n\nu/MarkCuban\n\nu/PresidentObama\n\nu/JoannaGaines\n\nu/ElonMusk\n\nu/PopeFrancis\n\nu/RachaelDolezal\n\nu/1r0nyman\n\nP.S. If you have gotten this far and believe any of this,  you are in fact a moron. Stay Stonky!",

        "selftext": "Currently, I am working full-time at McDonalds and Wendy's and I am using a calculator to calculate how many customers walk into the store, and then storing it on word. During quarantine, we would get a lot of cars in the drive through, but now those decreased by quite a bit at both my positions. Now, like we get quite a few cars but not as many, but we have quite a few more people walking in for takeaway.\n\n My guess is approximately 300(+-100) come in per hour but before it was around 310 (+-110) at McDonalds and at Wendy's it is now 200 (+-80) versus the 214.20(+-100) it was before. These were done by calculating the average by using different weights depending on the time that I selected at random.\n\nAlso, I am not really sure how reliable my numbers are as sometimes I would get bored and just guess the number of customers that were there.\n\nMy question is, as I have done this technical analysis, would it be insider trading to buy a bunch of puts as I think McDonalds and Wendy's will both tank like around 10% (+-15%)because fewer people are ordering. Like McDonalds has at least 10,00,00 stores in the USA so it will be quite a significant amount of dropping and I can also long McDonalds when Wendy's release their earnings first as when their stock drops McDonalds will also go up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S: Is it insider trading if it is like 500 usd?",

        "selftext": "TL;DR - Short TF out of this or buy puts once available. A company riddled with a history of fraud, misleading investors, and deceitful accounting tactics is being dumped to the public by a large private equity firm.\n\nMy god, this is one of the most blatant cash outs I\u2019ve ever seen. CNBC was pumping this name all morning and interviewed their CEO who touted its new \u201cOmni channel\u201d strategy that will lead to better margins. My BS meter started going off so I decided to read their S-1 and see what was going on under the hood.\n\nKrispy Kreme used to be public in the 2000\u2019s and was acquired by JAB Holdings in 2016 for $1.35 billion following numerous scandals of channel stuffing and overstating revenues. Execs would pretty much order shipments of donuts to be sent to franchises and claim sales to meet quarterly estimates. Wild. There are other irregular accounting techniques used throughout the years along with bullying tactics used against franchise owners but you get the picture, won\u2019t go into detail.\n\nSo now after a few years of being private sprinkled with an acquisition (Insomnia Cookies), execs/JAB decided it was time to cash out.\n\nIn the presentation, Krispy Kreme emphasizes its strong revenue growth. This is a trap. Their organic growth is flat +1% at most when you strip out revenues from their debt heavy acquisition which is why their margins are just awful now and will not improve. It also excludes new shops that were recently opened because it does not matter if you are growing as a company if you can\u2019t achieve economies of scale. You see this a lot with companies who know they can\u2019t be profitable - emphasize revenue growth! \n\nKrispy Kreme shouldn\u2019t trade at more than 1x its revenue until it proves it can be profitable through some miraculous turnaround. At a $3 billion market cap currently, I forecast it is nearly 40% overvalued. This should be a $10 stock. Whoever the lead underwriter was for this IPO deserves a raise after pulling such a ridiculous multiple. I guess that\u2019s why companies go public when the market is at all-time highs.",

        "selftext": "I am an experienced and seasoned trader, who has proudly turned a small $5,000 investment in January of 2019 into a fortune worth over $5,102. Most of my profits came from following the excellent DD on this sub, realizing I had lost nearly all of my money, and then getting really lucky playing biotech stocks right around COVID. At the height of my investing career I had turned that $5,000 into around $10,000 plus or minus $5,000.\n\nYesterday a realization dawned on me. I looked back at my comment history on a since deleted account and found that I had credulously bought into hundreds of plays based on TA and hype from ostensibly honest posters - people who positioned themselves as men of the people who wanted us all to succeed. I had to ask myself *if all of these people wanted me to succeed, why did I keep _losing money_ every time I followed their advice?*\n\nThe realization was this: I, boy genius, had been had by a pack of charlatans. These posters were not in fact benign and kind hearted genius day traders with brilliant plays based on scientific and technical analysis. Their DD may have been long and full of many colorful charts with arrows and candles and awesome phrases; but their hearts were empty and their premises were naught but lies!\n\nRather than trying to make *me* rich, they were fattening me - and people like me - up for the proverbial slaughter. Like so many suckered before me, I had nodded my head, opened my wallet, and bought whatever they told me: PLTR, AMC, NIO, GLD, SLV, AAL, the list goes on.\n\nSure *maybe* my account would become turgid for a few glittering moments but it never climaxed into a blizzard of cocaine and Benjamins as the posters promised. Usually I was left watching my options bleed on the daily as the initial frenzy of interest by retail mongoloids diminished and the dumb money flooded into the next frenzied promise.. time and time again.. time and time again.\n\nSo now that I have wizened myself to this treacherous game, I want to know. How do you identify the GOOD tips from the BAD tips. How do we know when a poster on here has the goods?",

The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 152.82 points to close at 34,786.35. The S&amp;P 500 has now risen for seven consecutive sessions, its longest winning streak since August.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Solid moves by major tech stocks helped support the overall market on Friday, with shares of Apple and Salesforce rising by nearly 2% and 1.3%, respectively. Microsoft jumped 2.2%.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For the week, the Nasdaq Composite rose nearly 2%, while the S&amp;P 500 and Dow climbed 1.7% and 1%, respectively. Several sectors closed at record levels on Friday, including tech and health care.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The strong week on Wall Street was spurred by a string of solid economic reports, capped by a better-than-expected jobs report on Friday morning.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The economy [added 850,000 jobs last month](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/02/jobs-report-june-2021.html), according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones were expecting an addition of 706,000. The print topped the revised 583,000 jobs created in May.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cThis is a strong report and should be taken as a sign of things to come for an accelerating labor market,\u201d Aberdeen Standard Investments deputy chief economist James McCann said in a note.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Angelo Kourkafas, an investment strategist at Edward Jones, said that the report showed solid growth but wouldn\u2019t change the Fed\u2019s policy path, hitting a sweet spot for markets.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cI think it was one of these goldilocks-type of reports, because hiring accelerated -- which is a positive sign for the second half and the recovery -- but not so much that it would trigger a reaction of an accelerated timeline for the Federal Reserve to start tapering,\u201d Kourkafas said.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In addition to the job gains, average hourly wages rose 0.3% for the month and are up 3.6% year over year, matching expectations.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius said that the report eased concerns about a labor shortage.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cI think we also learned that the explanations for the weaker numbers from April and May -- namely that seasonal probably weighing on job growth and probably some impact from the unemployment benefits on labor supply -- that those were pretty good explanations. So I think it was reassuring, in that sense,\u201d Hatzius said on CNBC\u2019s \u201c[Squawk on the Street](https://www.cnbc.com/squawk-on-the-street/),\u201d adding that the unemployment rate coming in higher than expected showed that the recovery still had a long way to go.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The S&amp;P 500 has now risen in five of the past six weeks, while the Nasdaq has gained in six of the past seven weeks.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Even with the recent strength for stocks, market strategists say that uncertainty about the future of the Fed\u2019s asset purchases and the upcoming earnings season could keep stocks from making major gains in the near term.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cThe market is still very much concerned about the Fed\u2019s reaction function,\u201d said Max Gokhman, head of asset allocation at Pacific Life Fund Advisors, adding that he thought there was still a lot of slack in the labor market.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;One weak spot for the markets this week was small caps, as the Russell 2000 slipped 1% on Friday to finish negative for the week.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;On Friday, shares of Boeing fell 1.3%, weighing on the Dow, after a 737 cargo plane made an [emergency landing off the coast of Honolulu](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/02/boeing-cargo-plane-makes-emergency-landing-in-ocean-off-honolulu-coast-faa-says.html?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_content=Main&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1625234441).

There was no one working the box office selling tickets, you could only buy tickets from the automated machine, there were two of these machines and one was out of printer paper so you couldn\u2019t use it.\n\n3. There was no one taking tickets to get into the theater, AT ALL, you literally could have just walked into any movie carrying anything.\n\n4. The 7:00 movie we saw had a grand total of 22\nPeople in it.\n\n5. The tickets with tax were 24$ and a regular popcorn and regular soda was 15$, so nearly 40$ for two people to go to a movie (cheaper to stream it from home)\n\nThis is a doomed business unless something drastically changes. People are streaming from home for cheaper.  Black widow box office numbers are way down because of streaming.\n\nI will\nBe surprised if AmC still exist in a couple years \n\nApes be careful!!

Whether you believe in the (banned phrase) or not this DD applies to any smooth brained tendie dependent retard who wants to make a quick buck this week.\n\nI will layout some technical analysis for why I believe we are beginning our reversal out of the past weeks sell off and potential for a higher rally.\n\nThere are plenty technical DD's on the large cup and handle, a low AF RSI, MACD about to cross, the continuation of higher lows being built, and elaborate wave theory ANALysis' but that shit is too advanced for my wrinkle-less, crayon eating self.\n\nSo, today I got bored and pulled up the GME chart to jerk off just like any other Sunday, but I realized a very interesting pattern that has repeated itself 5 separate times over the past 12 months.\n\n**The pattern involves a 1-3 week sell off followed by a test of support (different support each time), a green candle followed by a doji star (very important), and then a rally of up to 300% (minimum 70%) into the next 2 weeks. (or faster!!)**\n\nHere are the 5 times this has happened and what support was contacted and what occurred as a result of this pattern.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**the red line is the 50 day moving average and the rally of 90% took 10 days!!!**\n\n[10\\/26\\/2020 - 11\\/30\\/2020](https://preview.redd.it/6h0agzdi3pa71.png?width=1073&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96016ccc9bb48810d06cb9a9dd7f321588512be3)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**once again the red line is the 50 day moving average and the rally of 70% took 6 days!!!**\n\n[12\\/8\\/2020 - 12\\/23\\/2020](https://preview.redd.it/7pg63gq44pa71.png?width=1017&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01dc80e260813e84c8d003f2d0a9d723f80ce67e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**for this one I used the close of the prior day at $100 even as my \"support\". 200%+ gain**\n\n[2\\/25\\/2021 - 3\\/9\\/2021](https://preview.redd.it/rp0wi9t94pa71.png?width=1388&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c98c24722621e2cdcd80a9d2eb1130b6b899336)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**now for this one our support was a trendline from February/March and the rally actually went all the way to $340. notice the support is always tested with a green candle followed by doji star.**\n\n[4\\/27\\/2021 - 5\\/26\\/2021](https://preview.redd.it/h3os2n7d4pa71.png?width=2013&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15bc079ad8a3af1b0263a43c7a8a68b707a45a53)\n\n\"Wow! So cool! Why are you showing me this?\"\n\nI can already hear you retards asking why this pattern is significant and the reason is this is our current chart setup...\n\n**This support level was the 100 day moving average (white line; cocaine cramer is that you?) and we formed the EXACT SAME CANDLE COMBO.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u969xf4g4pa71.png?width=1292&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=508cc76c9652b2c871630d6b151e3beb0bd55602\n\nFeel free to go back to the charts to confirm that what I am showing you is actually real.\n\nIt is up to you on how to capitalize on this situation but I recommend 80% shares and 20% FDs.\n\nPositions: 60 shares and 200c 7/16.\n\n**TLDR: GME has formed a candle combo off of support lines 5 times after sell offs. We just formed the same combo on THUR/FRI last week off of the 100 day moving average and my tits are cutting holes in my shirts they are so jacked!**",

If you have friends in China, look  up their comments on WeChat or WeiBo, they are cheering for turning  education sector into non-profit.\n\nThe  honeymoon with Chinese tech stocks are way over and the price Chinese  stocks, even now for some, had priced in a friendly, laissez faire  regulation and CONTROL from the Chinese government.\n\nIt  might be the time to be greedy while the market is fearful.

        "selftext": "I was thinking of setting aside 10% of my stock portfolio for gambling.  Not casino gambling but stock market gambling.  Stocks, ETFs, Mutual Funds, and other investments I can buy through Fidelity Investments that have the potential to make me lots of money in a very short time, but also have the potential to drop rapidly in a period of market turmoil.\n\nHere is an example of what I am talking about:  **TQQQ** (TQQQ is a levered fund that delivers 3x exposure only over a one-day holding period of NASDAQ-100 stocks. The underlying index includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on NASDAQ based on market capitalization.)\n\nIf I had invested $10,000 in TQQQ ten years ago it would be worth $797,065 today.  But it went for a wild ride during the last ten years. Even in an era of a booming stock market, it dropped 49.2% during a market correction. The worst was during last Spring when the COVID crisis scared the stock market.  But if I ignored all the ups and downs I would be rich if I sold it today.\n\nThere are other investments that are similar.  What do you think of putting some of your money in a similarly high risk but high potential reward investment?",

        "selftext": "A friend of mine- who retired early at age 60- is well off and does not really need the money from Social Security.  So he plans to apply for SS and invest each monthly check in the stock and bond market and give the proceeds to his children at his death.  The question is should he start collecting at age 62 or wait till 70 and get the largest monthly check.\n\nFor the sake of argument, he said he plans to live to age 90.  So if he collected Social Security at age 62 he would collect 336 smaller monthly checks for 28 years.  If he waited until 70 to collect SS he would collect 240 larger monthly checks for 20 years.\n\nI found this was fascinating math and investing question.  So I did some calculations from the historical stock market records.  I used both a total stock market fund and a balanced mutual fund (Vanguard Wellington (VWELX) that has been in operation since the 1930s.\n\nI assumed the \"collect at age 62 monthly check\" to be $2000 a month and a collect starting at age 70 check of $4000.00.  Each would increase each year for inflation.  My findings:  **There has never been a situation where someone would come out ahead in any starting point waiting till 70 to collect if they die at age 90.**  **Either with a total stock market fund or a balanced mutual fund.** Check it out on this website:\n\n[https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio#analysisResults](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio#analysisResults)",

Just getting a status update on what everything thinks may happen this quarter and in the future.\n\nJust to throw some possibilities around, here are some discussion points. \n\nWhat do you expect this quarter? Will it be enough to push Tesla back above $700?\n\nWill having Bitcoin on the balance sheet gave an effect on their quarter? It's dropped some but not that much.\n\nHow do you think the stock will react if Tesla rolls out Full self driving that can drive people to work? The new subscription model is out, so FSDAAS is now an option, how does that effect their revenue next quarter and long term? How soon do you think FSD rolls out to wide release? It's already looking very impressive, but still needs some fine tuning. Will it be v10 or v11 that is capable? Is the processor enough to handle level 4 driving? What will be needed for level 5 FSD? \n\nHow soon will the Austin and Berlin plants open up to prodiction? Are they duplicating problem solving of the 4680 Model Y line between Texas and Germany? Who is farther along? Is Berlin almost ready to go and just delayed by permit processes? Will the new factories be covered in solar panels?\n\nWhat is the going forward plans for letting other auto manufacturers use the Tesla charging network? Will all new chargers be pass through with 300kwh charging? That will be needed for the cybertruck. How big will their charging network need to grow, and how will that effect their revenue? Will they charge more for other manufacturers? How do they set that up?\n\nWill Tesla start manufacturing the semi soon? Do they have enough 4680 cells? Which location will be producing 4680 cells next, and is the final process completed?  \n\nWhat the status on the updated cybertruck, and when will it be updated to show any other features? The 8 ton press has not arrived in Texas yet for the cybertruck castings.\n\nWhat grid scale battery projects are they working on now?\n\nWhat is delaying the S right now? It's hit pause on deliveries at the moment. Was the plaid fire a cause for concern on the battery?\n\nAny further updates on the Model 2 and what's the plan for release on a $25k Tesla? How soon will it be debuted and when will it be released?\n\nWhat's the plans for AI day? Elon said this month, but will we get an update? How far along is DoJo? Will it speed up training for machine learning? Will it allow for processing far bigger datasets for self-driving? Where is it going to be located? \n\nWhat else do you expect from Tesla and where do you see them later this decade? Can other manufacturers keep up with their battery innovation? The bolt is being recalled for major issues, the Taycan was recalled for firmware updates, Volkswagen is having major software issues",

        "selftext": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/11/science/richard-branson-virgin-galactic-space.html?smid=url-share\n\nSPACEPORT AMERICA, N.M. \u2014 Soaring more than 50 miles into the hot, glaringly bright skies above New Mexico, Richard Branson at last fulfilled a dream that took decades to realize: He can now call himself an astronaut.\n\nOn Sunday morning, a small rocket plane operated by Virgin Galactic, which Mr. Branson founded in 2004, carried him and five other people to the edge of space and back.\n\nMore than an hour later, a Mr. Branson took the stage to celebrate. \u201cThe whole thing was magical,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Branson\u2019s flight reinforces the hopes of space enthusiasts that routine travel to the final frontier may soon be available to private citizens, not just the professional astronauts of NASA and other space agencies. Another billionaire with his own rocket company \u2014 Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon \u2014 has plans to make a similar jaunt to the edge of space in nine days.\n\nIn each case, billionaire entrepreneurs are risking injury or death to fulfill their childhood aspirations \u2014 and advance the goal of making human spaceflight unexceptional.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re putting their money where their mouth is, and they\u2019re putting their body where their money is,\u201d said Eric Anderson, chairman of Space Adventures Limited, a company that charters launches to orbit. \u201cThat\u2019s impressive, frankly.\u201d\n\nAt 8:40 a.m. Mountain time, a carrier aircraft, with the rocket plane, named V.S.S. Unity, tucked underneath, rose off the runway and headed to an altitude of about 45,000 feet. There, Unity was released, and a few moments later, its rocket motor ignited, accelerating the space plane on an upward arc.\n\nAlthough Unity had made three previous trips to space, this was its first launch that resembled a full commercial flight of the sort that Virgin Galactic has promised to offer the general public, with two pilots \u2014 David Mackay and Michael Masucci \u2014 and four more crew members including Mr. Branson.\n\nThis flight resembled a party for Virgin Galactic and the nascent space tourism business. Guests included Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX; Michelle Lujan Grisham, the governor of New Mexico; and about 60 customers who have paid for future Virgin Galactic flights.\n\nStephen Colbert of the CBS program \u201cThe Late Show\u201d introduced segments of the webcast that included some live video from inside the spaceship. After the landing, Khalid performed a new song.\n\nWhen the fuel was spent, Unity continued to coast upward to an altitude of 53.5 miles. The four people in back unbuckled and experienced about four minutes of floating before returning to their seats.\n\nMr. Branson was accompanied in the cabin by Beth Moses, the company\u2019s chief astronaut instructor; Colin Bennett, lead operations engineer; and Sirisha Bandla, vice president of government affairs and research operations.\n\nAs the space plane re-entered the atmosphere, the downward pull of gravity resumed. Unity glided to a landing back at the spaceport.\n\nFor well over a decade, Mr. Branson, the irreverent 70-year-old British billionaire who runs a galaxy of Virgin companies, has said he believes that commercial flights will soon begin. So did the 600 or so customers of Virgin Galactic who have paid $200,000 or more for their tickets to space and are still waiting. So did the taxpayers of New Mexico who paid $220 million to build Spaceport America, a futuristic vision in the middle of the desert, in order to attract Mr. Branson\u2019s company.\n\nAfter years and years of unmet promises, Virgin Galactic may begin flying the first paying passengers next year after two more test flights. But with tickets costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, this experience will, for now, remain out of financial reach for most people.\n\nFounding a space exploration company was perhaps an unsurprising step for Mr. Branson, who has made a career \u2014 and a fortune estimated at $6 billion \u2014 building flashy upstart businesses that he promotes with a showman\u2019s flair.\n\nWhat became his Virgin business empire began with a small record shop in central London in the 1970s before Mr. Branson parlayed it into Virgin Records, the home of acts like the Sex Pistols, Peter Gabriel and more. In 1984, he was a co-founder of what became Virgin Atlantic, to challenge British Airways.\n\nThe Virgin Group branched out into a mobile-phone service, a passenger railway and a line of hotels. Not all have performed flawlessly. Two of his airlines filed for insolvency during the pandemic last year, while few today remember his ventures into soft drinks, cosmetics or lingerie.\n\nThe spaceflight company was of a piece with Mr. Branson\u2019s penchant for highflying pursuits like skydiving and hot-air ballooning. And unlike many of the Virgin Group\u2019s businesses, Virgin Galactic has been a major focus of Mr. Branson\u2019s.\n\nVirgin Galactic joined the New York Stock Exchange in 2019 after merging with a publicly traded investment fund, giving it a potent source of new funds to compete with deep-pocket competitors \u2014 and publicity, with Mr. Branson marking its trading debut at the exchange in one of the company\u2019s flight suits.\n\nThe Virgin Group retains a 24 percent stake in Virgin Galactic.\n\nVirgin Galactic\u2019s space plane is a scaled-up version of SpaceShipOne, which in 2004 captured the $10 million Ansari X Prize as the first reusable crewed spacecraft built by a nongovernmental organization to make it to space twice in two weeks.\n\nMr. Branson initially predicted commercial flights would begin by 2007. But development of the larger craft, SpaceShipTwo, stretched out.\n\nThe first SpaceShipTwo vehicle, V.S.S. Enterprise, crashed during a test flight in 2014, killing one of the pilots. Virgin Galactic was then grounded until Unity was completed a year and a half later.\n\nIn 2019, Virgin Galactic came close to another catastrophe when a seal on a rear horizontal stabilizer ruptured because a new thermal protection film had been improperly installed.\nThe mishap was revealed this year in the book \u201cTest Gods: Virgin Galactic and the Making of a Modern Astronaut\u201d by Nicholas Schmidle, a staff writer at The New Yorker. The book quotes Todd Ericson, then the vice president for safety and test at Virgin Galactic, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know how we didn\u2019t lose the vehicle and kill three people.\u201d\n\nMr. Bezos\u2019 flight is to take place about 200 miles to the southeast of Spaceport America in Van Horn, Texas, where his rocket company, Blue Origin, launches its New Shepard rocket and capsule.\n\nAlthough Blue Origin has yet to fly any people on New Shepard, 15 successful uncrewed tests of the fully automated system convinced the company it would be safe to put Mr. Bezos on the first flight with people aboard.\n\nHe will be joined by his brother, Mark, and Mary Wallace Funk, an 82-year-old pilot. In the 1960s, she was among a group of women who passed the same rigorous criteria that NASA used for selecting astronauts, but the space agency at the time had no interest in selecting women as astronauts. A fourth unnamed passenger paid $28 million in an auction for one of the seats.\n\nNeither Blue Origin nor Virgin Galactic flights go high enough or fast enough to enter orbit around Earth. Rather, these suborbital flights are more like giant roller coaster rides that allow passengers to float for a few minutes while admiring a view of Earth against the black backdrop of space.\n\nMr. Bezos\u2019 company emphasized the rivalry with Virgin Galactic for space tourism passengers in a tweet on Friday. Blue Origin highlighted differences between its New Shepard rocket and Virgin Galactic\u2019s SpaceShipTwo including the fact that New Shepard flies higher, above the altitude of 100 kilometers, or about 62 miles, that is often regarded as the boundary of space. However, the United States Air Force and the Federal Aviation Administration set the boundary at 50 miles.\n\nThe company also noted the size of the New Shepard capsule\u2019s windows, and called Virgin Galactic\u2019s Unity \u201ca high-altitude plane\u201d in contrast to New Shepard\u2019s rocket.\nMr. Bezos on Sunday congratulated Mr. Branson and his fellow crew on their flight. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to join the club!\u201d he added in an Instagram post.\n\nBlue Origin has not yet announced a ticket price, and Virgin Galactic\u2019s earlier quoted fare of $250,000 may rise. But on Sunday after his trip, Mr. Branson announced a sweepstakes that will give away two seats on a future Virgin Galactic flight.\n\nJoy-riding tourists will not be the only passengers on future suborbital flights. Both companies are selling flights to organizations including the Italian Air Force where scientists will conduct experiments that take advantage of the minutes of microgravity.\n\nThe era of nonprofessional astronauts regularly heading to orbit may also begin in the coming year. Jared Isaacman, a 38-year-old billionaire, is essentially chartering a rocket and spacecraft from SpaceX for a three-day trip to orbit that is scheduled for September.\n\nIn December, Space Adventures has arranged for a Japanese fashion entrepreneur, Yusaku Maezawa, and Yozo Hirano, a production assistant, to launch on a Russian Soyuz rocket on a 12-day mission that will go to the International Space Station.\n\nAnother company, Axiom Space in Houston, is arranging a separate trip to the space station that will launch as soon as January.\n\nThe orbital trips are too expensive for anyone except the superwealthy \u2014 Axiom\u2019s three customers are paying $55 million each \u2014 while suborbital flights might be affordable to those who are merely well off.\n\nBut how many people are willing to spend as much as some houses cost for a few minutes of space travel?\n\nCarissa Christensen, founder and chief executive of Bryce Space and Technology, an aerospace consulting firm, thinks there will be plenty. \u201cBased on previous ticket sales, surveys and interviews,\u201d she said in an email, \u201cwe see strong demand signals for multiple hundreds of passengers a year at current prices, with potential for thousands if prices drop significantly.\u201d\n\nMr. Anderson of Space Adventures is less certain.\n\n\u201cPer minute, it\u2019s like a thousand times more expensive than an orbital flight,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\nTwo decades ago, Space Adventures did sell suborbital flights including a ticket to Ms. Funk, who goes by Wally. \u201cWally Funk was one of our first customers,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cThat would have been like 1998.\u201d\n\nThe ticket price then was $98,000.\n\nAt one point, about 200 people signed up for suborbital flights, but none of the promised suborbital rocket companies was able to get their space planes close to flight. Space Adventures returned the money to Ms. Funk and the others.\n\nNow this unproven suborbital market has whittled down to a battle of billionaires \u2014 Mr. Branson and Mr. Bezos.\n\n\u201cIf anybody can make money and make the market work for suborbital, it\u2019s Branson and Bezos,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cThey have the reach and the cachet.\u201d",

        "selftext": " For context: I've been a ROBLOX developer for 8 years, on the platform for 11 years. I have 200M+ total visits (visits work like youtube views) and made $250k usd from roblox in the past year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n If you're a boomer, roblox is not a game, it's more of a marketplace/app store. Developers make games, players buy robux and spend them in games, developers convert the robux to usd. Roblox charges the standard fee of 30% on all robux transactions between players. The part  where they rip devs off, is how much USD they get from robux. If you buy robux, then convert that robux back to USD, you will not get the same amount you paid, even before the 30% tax.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Let's calculate how much roblox actually takes. If you spend $100 on robux, you will get 10,000 robux. After you spend all the robux in a game, the developer will get 7,000 robux after 30% tax. The current robux to usd rate is 100,000 robux for $350, with a minimum of 100,000 to cash out. That means the developer ends up with $24.50 from a player spending $100 in their game. Roblox is taking a 75.5% cut on robux earnings, compared to 30% on Steam or Apple app store. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n It gets worse, some devs aren't able to convert their robux to usd at all. Developers must be approved before they can convert robux. Even if all the robux came from legitimate means, some devs aren't accepted. This is an issue with roblox contractors (smaller developers who do commission work) and they can only get around that by accepting PayPal.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n What does this mean? Roblox is making bank off their developers, and the developers are fine with it. Lots of the developers are kids (under 18) and many from third world countries, so money has more value to them. Developers also fear the competition on other app stores where there are already established game dev companies. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy position: [2000 shares at $86.45](https://prnt.sc/1e15x8u)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Roblox takes 75.5% of earnings on robux from devs, devs don't care.

        "selftext": "SOFI seems to have hit a bottom around $17.25 today... and with PIPE selling exhausted- is ready to move much higher. (and what little selling may occur from employees- is a drop in the ocean compared to retail buyers... considering SOFI has less than 1000 employees). \n\n\nCramer just included SoFI as 1 of the post merger SPACs to buy now. SOFI has all buy ratings from analysts- with an initial $30 price target.  SoFI also has one of the highest short float % at around 45% (which meaning many Millions of shares have to he bought to cover those short positions). \n\n\nAnd with a market cap under $14B, SOFI is extremely undervalued (consider Robinhood going public later this summer around $40B.. likely to be $60B after 1st day of trading).  Buying SOFI anywhere near current prices- will definitely be a winner going forward.... and if SOFI gets several days of sustained volume... it is very likely to have a big run/squeeze combo in the immediate future. But its a definite big winner either way.  Not to mention a 2 for 1 deal... as Galileo will be worth just as much as SOFI- and an option to spin off in the Future (similar to EBay &amp; Paypal)\n\n\n**Summary of SOFI Becoming a Fintech Behemoth**\n\nFintech is becoming the next big disruptor- and Sofi is being positioned to be the real leader in this category (and currently- the dinosaur banks have market caps of 300B, $450B, etc). Not only is SOFI the only internet bank with the full slate of financial products...\nthey also have Galileo for the platform/\nSoftware fintech play... just look at the top quality leadership team SOFI is attracting... Anthony Noto as CEO.. CFO came from Uber... person in charge of Galileo from Google,etc.\n\n\n**Overview of Business **\n\nSoFi acquisition of Golden Pacific will make it a\nnational bank, like JPMorgan Chase. This will\nallow SOFI to take direct deposits &amp; make\nloans based on those deposits, rather than\nacting as a re-seller.\n\nSofi also offers Credit Cards &amp; recently\nannounced it deal to offer auto loans. Also,\ntheres SoFi brokerage, which competes with\nRobinhood.\n\nThen add to the mix, Galileo, a payments\nprocessor (ie Stripe, Square ) it bought for\n$1.2B. Galileo dominates the Banking-as-a-\nService (BaaS) ecosystem. Galileo offers\nbanking platform for over 90% of all digital\nbanks in North America. Over 70% of Top100\nFintechs globally are clients- including Chime\nand Robinhood.",

Ive been watching stock and feel its above fair value for me but for him is a screaming deal. Led me to research companies Ive worked at a holding of.\n\nThe ones that trade publicly are:\n\nYUM brands: YUM\n\nwould not buy on open market, believe it will do well but not outperform. Id be happy to buy discounted shares however. \n\nAlbertsons: ACI\n\nfinancials seem terrible, no room for real growth with pretty robust competition. Avoid.\n\nModivcare Inc: MODV\n\nStock price running real hot and enjoying a covid high, will probably correct hard. Medical transportation and logistics has been huge with covid but will soon be back to normal and they cant maintain the growth, with a PE of 66 im scared plus so much revenue is based on government contracts  I'm avoiding.\n\nWalMart: WMT\n\nNot going to outperform, never going away. Would buy at discount, wont buy open market.\n\nDick's:  DKS\n\ntheir financials seem really good. I dont know how but they are crushing it. The ones local to me dont seem to do much business. But revenue, profits, doing great. Buying back shares to increase stock value and even paying a dividend for icing on the cake. Im contemplating buying some open market after some more DD as this one confuses me and will jump on a discounted share in a heartbeat, which almost pains me to say since that was my least favorite place to work ever.\n\nMy current employer is the federal government so their stock is pretty much a bond and those arte pretty lame.

        "selftext": "Posting here to offer a little perspective on what some apes saw as a quick hype play.\n\nIt was evident that PSFE had finally found bottom last week after months of daily short attacks.  For months, we saw all the tell-tale signs of market manipulators expertly shaking out retail shareholders with order flow, short volume, massive block trades and 13F\u2019s showing institutions steadily loading up.  In this context, just as PSFE was to be officially added to the Russell 1000 and 3000 indexes, it seemed a little suspicious that Paysafe was suddenly being hyped and trending on WallStreetBets.  I had to wonder if this was an engineered event to generate more liquidity since market makers were clearly running out of sellers right when they had to fill a lot more institutional orders.\n\nThat\u2019s all just monkey brain theory that ultimately doesn't matter because my plan is to hold PSFE long-term.  There is a clear strategy with this company that will take some time to come to fruition and I want to be in on the ground floor, before all the rosy ER\u2019s come in.  With a fintech that does roughly as much transactional volume as Square and, despite recent reports, has similar growth to PayPal, it\u2019s no surprise that institutions want to accumulate at levels so low that the stock is almost completely de-risked from a long-term perspective.\n\nThe comprehensive DD below is for the diamond handed apes who may have been caught in the recent hype. Know that you\u2019re not alone. We saw the same thing right after CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer called Paysafe, \u201cthe ultimate stock for this moment\u201d and market analyst Steve Grasso repeated his calls for it go to \u201c$45/$50 and then settle in before moving higher from there.\u201d  After initial spikes, deep-pocketed short-sellers methodically crushed retail holders, eventually bringing the price down to where it was last week.\n\nBut informed short sellers knew they couldn't push too far because that price was really not far from the price paid by noted fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 10 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares) and Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares).  A price probably lower than paid by Wells Fargo\u2019s several funds (12 million shares) and even by Blackstone when they raised their initial stake of 123 million shares to a total of 160 million shares.^(1)  Also, it\u2019s worth noting that, since they all decided to invest, Paysafe has created significant value including securing new revenue streams in the US iGaming market and expanded partnerships with Coinbase, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, and Microsoft among others. ^(2)\n\nWith a presence in 120 countries, Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor: #1 global leader in iGaming, #2 global digital wallet, #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. Ever since private equity groups Blackstone and CVC took Paysafe private, they\u2019ve been going through a major restructuring to reduce risk, increase margins and profits. It's because they are still very much in the middle of that process that I like it so much as an investment opportunity. Here are a few key points:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* In 2017, private equity groups Blackstone and CVC raised their bid five times to ultimately to take Paysafe private for $3.9 billion.^(3)  Blackstone says their typical investment term is \u201cupwards of 7-10 years\u201d ^(4) which aligns with the investment time-frame implied by an inside source close to those negotiations who said, \u201cThere is a fundamental change in the way we pay for goods and services, away from the cash and cheques of our parents\u2019 age,\u201d adding that the private equity firms \u201chave a decade-long thesis that this shift will only grow and grow and they want to get in now.\u201d ^(5)\n* Under Blackstone/CVC\u2019s stewardship, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). Last year, due to Covid-related brick-and-mortar business and sporting event closures, along with their long-standing strategic decision to exit specific high-risk Asian revenue channels, 2020 revenue stagnated.  This is the reason they recently reported only 5% YoY quarterly growth.  In their Q1 ER, management noted that, without those channel exits they would have reported growth in the \u201cmid to high teens.\u201d  But even if you include 2020\u2019s stagnant growth, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s current projected growth. ^(6,7)\n* A few months ago, Paysafe was brought public through a reverse merger transaction with acclaimed deal maker Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity. The deal paid down $1.2 billion in debt and gave Blackstone/CVC about $5.6 billion in cash and shares.^(8)  The fact that Blackstone's recent 13F shows they bought back 37 million shares, combined with statements from them and Paysafe's board, indicates that they did this deal, not for a mere 44% gain on a four year investment, but because Bill Foley is an extraordinarily successful and well-connected deal maker who has a proven track record for generating exponential growth.\n* Inorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe\u2019s strategy going forward.  Bill Foley, now Chairman of Paysafe and a major shareholder, is a proven M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena.  Foley took Fidelity National Financial from $3 million market cap to $10.8 billion. Yeah, that\u2019s and \u201cm\u201d and a \u201cb\u201d.  Over just the last five years, Foley grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).  Through his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion market cap. That\u2019s a 36x return.  He says  \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d ^(6,9)\n\n**Deleveraging, increasing margins and profit**\n\n* Paysafe recently confirmed they are on track to meet 2021 projections of $1.53 billion in revenue, $930-$970 million in gross profit, double-digit growth and expanding 30-35% EBITDA margins, and $103 billion in transactional volume.  Paysafe\u2019s already strong $362 million in 2020 free cash flow was reported to be on track for 29% growth in 2021.  Notably, their multi-year projections don\u2019t include growth from their \"active M&amp;A pipeline\" and their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR).\n* Q1's earnings disappointed some because, as part of their restructuring, they had $90 million in one-time non-recurring expenses associated with the merger and paying down $1.2 billion in debt. The company noted: \u201cResults included interest expense of $58.5 million, an increase of 53% compared to the prior year, reflecting the expense of capitalized debt fees as a result of debt repayment on March 31, 2021. Net loss also included share-based compensation of $72.4 million, compared to none in the prior year due to shares vested on completion of the Transaction.\"\n* Take away the $90 million in one-time expenses and, rather than reporting a $49 million loss, the company would have reported $41 million in quarterly net profit, thereby beating all analyst estimates. All signs indicate they are on track to beat estimates going forward, although I have noticed a few platforms raising those estimates recently.\n* In addition to paying down $1.2 billion in debt, an improved Moody\u2019s credit rating has enabled the company to refinance roughly a billion at a 1.25% lower interest rate, with an option to reduce it another 25bp.^(10)  Foley says: \u201cOne of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe\u2019s leverage ratio to 3.6x Debt/EBITDA.\u201d  Notably, this Debt/EBITDA ratio is far better than the majority of their fintech peers, and the resulting improved margins stand to make it better still.\n* The combined effect of overall recent debt management will be a savings of around $92 million annually.  This secures higher margins, increased cash for M&amp;A and higher profits which, in my view, will lead to raised price targets and positive price action catalysts.\n* As part of their restructuring to cut down on operating expenses and further increase margins, Paysafe has recently forged agreements with Snowflake and AWS as they move to cloud-based integration for easier migration between their platforms, easier cross-border payments and planned expansion into global banking as a service, having identified a $58 trillion TAM.\n\n**Highly competitve**\n\n* Unlike other payment processors, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY.  Just today, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.\n* In various segments, Paysafe has recently expanded their partnerships with FOX bet, Roblox, Fortnight, Coinbase, Amazon, Twitch, Microsoft/Xbox, bet365, ApplePay, Draftkings, Spotify, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, Amelco, BetMGM, Ceasar\u2019s, and Pointsbet among many others.\n* \\#4 globally in integrated merchant processing, Paysafe\u2019s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n* They are #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n* People are usually more likely to leave reviews when a payment platform doesn\u2019t meet their expectations. That said, Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe\u2019s digital wallet Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). ^(11)\n   * By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as \u201cAverage 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). ^(12)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1axvo1n3sl871.png?width=475&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca4bb0678156d9737029ff6a3075728bd54e8940\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d**\n\n**\u201cIt\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\"** \\- Bill Foley\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter, due to managing risk and a very complex regulatory landscape. Paysafe\u2019s advantage here is a large aspect of its MOAT, as discussed below.  Paysafe is often an integrated back-end payment processor so most don\u2019t realize they are using it but they are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion in the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting.\n* Bill Foley says, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else\u2026we\u2019re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting\u201d\n* In his letter to investors, fund manager Dan Loeb said, \u201cWe believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.\u201d\n* Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso, who initiated coverage with a $19 price target, noted, \u201cPSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,\u201d adding, \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d ^(13)\n   * Recent headlines since Del Grasso wrote that:\n      * \"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\n      * \"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\n      * \u201cNew Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\n      * \"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\n      * \"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\n      * \u201dDelaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March\"\n      * \"Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%\"\n      * \u201cCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\n      * \u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\n      * \u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\n      * \u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\n      * \u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\n      * \u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\n      * \u201cFlorida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal\u201d\n      * \u201cLegal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think\u201d\n      * \u201cCanada legalizes single-game sports betting\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Every analyst covering Paysafe rates it as a \"Buy\". A few quotes :\n   * RBC Capital 5-star analyst Daniel Perlin: \u201cWe believe PSFE offers a unique combination of digital wallet capabilities, accelerated cash conversion for consumers who would otherwise be out of the ecommrece loop, and integrated payments, all focused on specialized &amp; complex end-markets, which creates a competitive moat and pricing power.\u201d \u201crecent underperformance is largely due to the complex nature of PSFE\u2019s business and the FTAC II transaction\u201d and adds his view that Paysafe offers one of the best combinations of services in online payment space: \u201cPSFE has created a unique two-sided network enabling merchants to accept online &amp; in-store payments (in specific niche verticals), while also offering consumers a digital wallet &amp; eCash solution, which converts cash-heavy users to digital users. We believe it\u2019s this combination that enables PSFE to generate superior take rate economics vs. peers.\u201d ^(14)\n   * BMO Capital, 5-star analyst, James Fotheringham: \u201cPSFE is a global leader in iGaming (online betting related to sports, poker, and other casino games, as well as lotteries and bingo). Indeed, 36% of PSFE\u2019s revenues are from global iGaming. That is far more than for any of its peers.\u201d iGaming deposit volumes in the U.S. will grow \u201cat more than five times the rate of growth elsewhere in the world\u201d with a \"5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of between 40% to 55%.\" ^(15)\n   * Evercore ISI analyst David Togut 'praised Paysafe for its \u201crobust risk management operation,\u201d and its high rankings in several key performance indictors globally, including cash network, stored digital wallet value, and amount of partnered independent merchants.' ^(16)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MOAT:**  **\u201crobust risk management operation\u201d**\n\nSo why does Paysafe dominate iGaming and why how is it able offer eCommerce services to the 1.7 billion globally who can't even manage to have bank accounts or credit cards?\n\nTheir industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from transcript : \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players\u2026we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can\u2019t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we\u2019re not only talking about take rates and comps, we\u2019re talking about revenue-generation, we\u2019re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That\u2019s a really, really powerful position to have.\u201d ^(9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Valuation:**\n\nA while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.\n\n* Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin,  mid to high teen EBITDA growth, and $362 million in free cash flow (now on track to increase 29%),\n* By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.\n* Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.\n* The group's collective growth rate of \\~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account their current expansion into US iGaming nor do they factor in their \"active M&amp;A pipeline.\"  Foley is apparently known for under-promising and over-performing.\n* As noted above, Paysafe was growing 28% CAGR pre-Covid, but taking into account last years slow down due to Covid-related business closures and strategic channel exits, it grew at 18% CAGR, a rate on par with PayPal's projected growth.\n\nGiven all the above factors, it seems fair to look at Paysafe's potential price based on an average of peer multiples:\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\nMore realistic price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : **$50.75**\n* EV/Rev ratio : **$44.64**\n* EV/FCF ratio : **$44.18**\n\n**Average : $46.52**\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe\u2019s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up.  While I don't necessarily agree with his time frame, market analyst Steve Grasso's call for \"$45/55\" may actually be quite reasonable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sources:**\n\n(1) see fintel or other source for institutional ownership.

        "selftext": "It was evident that PSFE had finally found bottom last week.  For months, we saw all the tell-tale signs of market manipulators expertly shaking out retail shareholders with order flow, short volume, massive block trades and 13F\u2019s showing institutions steadily loading up.  In this context, just as PSFE was to be officially added to the Russell 1000 and 3000 indexes, it seemed a little suspicious that Paysafe was suddenly being hyped and trending on WallStreetBets.  I had to wonder if this was an engineered event to generate more liquidity since market makers were clearly running out of sellers right when they had to fill a lot more institutional orders.\n\nThat\u2019s all just monkey brain theory that ultimately doesn't matter because my plan is to hold PSFE for a long time.  There is a clear strategy with this company that will take some time to come to fruition and I want to be in on the ground floor, before all the rosy ER\u2019s come in.  With a fintech that does roughly as much transactional volume as Square and, despite recent reports, has similar growth to PayPal, it\u2019s no surprise that institutions want to accumulate at levels so low that the stock is almost completely de-risked from a long-term perspective.\n\nThe comprehensive DD below is for investors with a longer view who may have been caught in the recent hype. Know that you\u2019re not alone. We saw the same thing right after CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer called Paysafe, \u201cthe ultimate stock for this moment\u201d and market analyst Steve Grasso repeated his calls for it go to \u201c$45/$50 and then settle in before moving higher from there.\u201d  After initial spikes, deep-pocketed short-sellers methodically crushed retail holders, eventually bringing the price down to where it was last week.\n\nBut informed short sellers knew they couldn't push too far because that price was really not far from the price paid by noted fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 10 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares) and Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares).  A price probably lower than paid by Wells Fargo\u2019s several funds (12 million shares) and even by Blackstone when they raised their initial stake of 123 million shares to a total of 160 million shares.^(1)  Also, it\u2019s worth noting that, since they all decided to invest, Paysafe has created significant value including securing new revenue streams in the US iGaming market and expanded partnerships with Coinbase, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, and Microsoft among others. ^(2)\n\nWith a presence in 120 countries, Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor: #1 global leader in iGaming, #2 global digital wallet, #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. Ever since private equity groups Blackstone and CVC took Paysafe private, they\u2019ve been going through a major restructuring to reduce risk, increase margins and profits. It's because they are still very much in the middle of that process that I like it so much as an investment opportunity. Here are a few key points:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* In 2017, private equity groups Blackstone and CVC raised their bid five times to ultimately to take Paysafe private for $3.9 billion.^(3)  Blackstone says their typical investment term is \u201cupwards of 7-10 years\u201d ^(4) which aligns with the investment time-frame implied by an inside source close to those negotiations who said, \u201cThere is a fundamental change in the way we pay for goods and services, away from the cash and cheques of our parents\u2019 age,\u201d adding that the private equity firms \u201chave a decade-long thesis that this shift will only grow and grow and they want to get in now.\u201d ^(5)\n* Under Blackstone/CVC\u2019s stewardship, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). Last year, due to Covid-related brick-and-mortar business and sporting event closures, along with their long-standing strategic decision to exit specific high-risk Asian revenue channels, 2020 revenue stagnated.  This is the reason they recently reported only 5% YoY quarterly growth.  In their Q1 ER, management noted that, without those channel exits they would have reported growth in the \u201cmid to high teens.\u201d  But even if you include 2020\u2019s stagnant growth, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s current projected growth. ^(6,7)\n* A few months ago, Paysafe was brought public through a reverse merger transaction with acclaimed deal maker Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity. The deal paid down $1.2 billion in debt and gave Blackstone/CVC about $5.6 billion in cash and shares.^(8)  The fact that Blackstone's recent 13F shows they bought back 37 million shares, combined with statements from them and Paysafe's board, indicates that they did this deal, not for a mere 44% gain on a four year investment, but because Bill Foley is an extraordinarily successful and well-connected deal maker who has a proven track record for generating exponential growth.\n* Inorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe\u2019s strategy going forward.  Bill Foley, now Chairman of Paysafe and a major shareholder, is a proven M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena.  Foley took Fidelity National Financial from $3 million market cap to $10.8 billion. Yeah, that\u2019s and \u201cm\u201d and a \u201cb\u201d.  Over just the last five years, Foley grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).  Through his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion market cap. That\u2019s a 36x return.  He says  \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d ^(6,9)\n\n**Deleveraging, increasing margins and profit**\n\n* Paysafe recently confirmed they are on track to meet 2021 projections of $1.53 billion in revenue, $930-$970 million in gross profit, double-digit growth and expanding 30-35% EBITDA margins, and $103 billion in transactional volume.  Paysafe\u2019s already strong $362 million in 2020 free cash flow was reported to be on track for 29% growth in 2021.  Notably, their multi-year projections don\u2019t include growth from their \"active M&amp;A pipeline\" and their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR).\n* Q1's earnings disappointed some because, as part of their restructuring, they had $90 million in one-time non-recurring expenses associated with the merger and paying down $1.2 billion in debt. The company noted: \u201cResults included interest expense of $58.5 million, an increase of 53% compared to the prior year, reflecting the expense of capitalized debt fees as a result of debt repayment on March 31, 2021. Net loss also included share-based compensation of $72.4 million, compared to none in the prior year due to shares vested on completion of the Transaction.\"\n* Take away the $90 million in one-time expenses and, rather than reporting a $49 million loss, the company would have reported $41 million in quarterly net profit, thereby beating all analyst estimates. All signs indicate they are on track to beat estimates going forward, although I have noticed a few platforms raising those estimates recently.\n* In addition to paying down $1.2 billion in debt, an improved Moody\u2019s credit rating has enabled the company to refinance roughly a billion at a 1.25% lower interest rate, with an option to reduce it another 25bp.^(10)  Foley says: \u201cOne of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe\u2019s leverage ratio to 3.6x Debt/EBITDA.\u201d  Notably, this Debt/EBITDA ratio is far better than the majority of their fintech peers, and the resulting improved margins stand to make it better still.\n* The combined effect of overall recent debt management will be a savings of around $92 million annually.  This secures higher margins, increased cash for M&amp;A and higher profits which, in my view, will lead to raised price targets and positive price action catalysts.\n* As part of their restructuring to cut down on operating expenses and further increase margins, Paysafe has recently forged agreements with Snowflake and AWS as they move to cloud-based integration for easier migration between their platforms, easier cross-border payments and planned expansion into global banking as a service, having identified a $58 trillion TAM.\n\n**Highly competitve**\n\n* Unlike other payment processors, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY.  Just today, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.\n* In various segments, Paysafe has recently expanded their partnerships with FOX bet, Roblox, Fortnight, Coinbase, Amazon, Twitch, Microsoft/Xbox, bet365, ApplePay, Draftkings, Spotify, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, Amelco, BetMGM, Ceasar\u2019s, and Pointsbet among many others.\n* \\#4 globally in integrated merchant processing, Paysafe\u2019s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n* They are #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n* People are usually more likely to leave reviews when a payment platform doesn\u2019t meet their expectations. That said, Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe\u2019s digital wallet Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). ^(11)\n   * By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as \u201cAverage 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). ^(12)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d**\n\n**\u201cIt\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\"** \\- Bill Foley\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter, due to managing risk and a very complex regulatory landscape. Paysafe\u2019s advantage here is a large aspect of its MOAT, as discussed below.  Paysafe is often an integrated back-end payment processor so most don\u2019t realize they are using it but they are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion in the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting.\n* Bill Foley says, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else\u2026we\u2019re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting\u201d\n* In his letter to investors, fund manager Dan Loeb said, \u201cWe believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.\u201d\n* Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso, who initiated coverage with a $19 price target, noted, \u201cPSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,\u201d adding, \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d ^(13)\n   * Recent headlines since Del Grasso wrote that:\n      * \"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\n      * \"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\n      * \u201cNew Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\n      * \"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\n      * \"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\n      * \u201dDelaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March\"\n      * \"Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%\"\n      * \u201cCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\n      * \u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\n      * \u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\n      * \u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\n      * \u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\n      * \u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\n      * \u201cFlorida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal\u201d\n      * \u201cLegal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think\u201d\n      * \u201cCanada legalizes single-game sports betting\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Every analyst covering Paysafe rates it as a \"Buy\". A few quotes :\n   * RBC Capital 5-star analyst Daniel Perlin: \u201cWe believe PSFE offers a unique combination of digital wallet capabilities, accelerated cash conversion for consumers who would otherwise be out of the ecommrece loop, and integrated payments, all focused on specialized &amp; complex end-markets, which creates a competitive moat and pricing power.\u201d \u201crecent underperformance is largely due to the complex nature of PSFE\u2019s business and the FTAC II transaction\u201d and adds his view that Paysafe offers one of the best combinations of services in online payment space: \u201cPSFE has created a unique two-sided network enabling merchants to accept online &amp; in-store payments (in specific niche verticals), while also offering consumers a digital wallet &amp; eCash solution, which converts cash-heavy users to digital users. We believe it\u2019s this combination that enables PSFE to generate superior take rate economics vs. peers.\u201d ^(14)\n   * BMO Capital, 5-star analyst, James Fotheringham: \u201cPSFE is a global leader in iGaming (online betting related to sports, poker, and other casino games, as well as lotteries and bingo). Indeed, 36% of PSFE\u2019s revenues are from global iGaming. That is far more than for any of its peers.\u201d iGaming deposit volumes in the U.S. will grow \u201cat more than five times the rate of growth elsewhere in the world\u201d with a \"5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of between 40% to 55%.\" ^(15)\n   * Evercore ISI analyst David Togut 'praised Paysafe for its \u201crobust risk management operation,\u201d and its high rankings in several key performance indictors globally, including cash network, stored digital wallet value, and amount of partnered independent merchants.' ^(16)\n\n**MOAT:**  **\u201crobust risk management operation\u201d**\n\nSo why does Paysafe dominate iGaming and why how is it able offer eCommerce services to the 1.7 billion globally who can't even manage to have bank accounts or credit cards?\n\nTheir industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from transcript : \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players\u2026we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can\u2019t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we\u2019re not only talking about take rates and comps, we\u2019re talking about revenue-generation, we\u2019re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That\u2019s a really, really powerful position to have.\u201d ^(9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Valuation:**\n\nA while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.\n\n* Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin,  mid to high teen EBITDA growth, and $362 million in free cash flow (now on track to increase 29%),\n* By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.\n* Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.\n* The group's collective growth rate of \\~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account their current expansion into US iGaming nor do they factor in their \"active M&amp;A pipeline.\"  Foley is apparently known for under-promising and over-performing.\n* As noted above, Paysafe was growing 28% CAGR pre-Covid, but taking into account last years slow down due to Covid-related business closures and strategic channel exits, it grew at 18% CAGR, a rate on par with PayPal's projected growth.\n\nGiven all the above factors, it seems fair to look at Paysafe's potential price based on an average of peer multiples:\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\nMore realistic price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : **$50.75**\n* EV/Rev ratio : **$44.64**\n* EV/FCF ratio : **$44.18**\n\n**Average : $46.52**\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe\u2019s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up.  While I don't necessarily agree with his time frame, market analyst Steve Grasso's call for \"$45/55\" may actually be quite reasonable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sources:**\n\n(1) [https://fintel.io/so/us/psfe](https://fintel.io/so/us/psfe).\n\n(2) [https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/oak2jx/paysafes\\_value\\_creation\\_trajectory\\_is\\_very\\_much/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/oak2jx/paysafes_value_creation_trajectory_is_very_much/)\n\n(3) [https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackstone-cvc-to-buy-paysafe-for-3-9-billion-in-latest-online-payments-deal-1501830827](https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackstone-cvc-to-buy-paysafe-for-3-9-billion-in-latest-online-payments-deal-1501830827)\n\n(4) [https://pws.blackstone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/the\\_life\\_cycle\\_of\\_private\\_equity\\_insights.pdf](https://pws.blackstone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/the_life_cycle_of_private_equity_insights.pdf)\n\n(5) [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-paysafe-group-m-a-idUSKBN1AK0KN](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-paysafe-group-m-a-idUSKBN1AK0KN)\n\n(6) [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm)\n\n(7) [https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst\\_Day\\_presentation\\_March\\_9\\_\\_2021.pdf](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst_Day_presentation_March_9__2021.pdf)\n\n(8) [https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/)\n\n(9)  [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm)\n\n(10)  Global Capital link removed due to forbidden word in the url. \n\n(11) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com)\n\n(12) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com)\n\n(13)  [https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html](https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html)\n\n(14) [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04)\n\n(15) [https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/](https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/)\n\n(16) [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html)",

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these hedge funds, go directly to the [**5 Biggest Hedge Fund Casualties of Reddit WallStreetBets' Short Squeezes**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/5-biggest-hedge-fund-casualties-of-reddit-wallstreetbets-short-squeezes-958146/)**.**\n\nHedge funds have suffered billions in losses this year in a fierce stock market showdown with retail investors on internet platforms like Reddit and Twitter over the past six months. These battles have usually centered around stocks that the hedge funds attempted to short-sell, inviting the wrath of users on Reddit forums like WallStreetBets, mostly comprising young investors, who bought up stakes in these companies to drive up the share price, initiating a short squeeze and making handsome profits in the process.\n\nSome of the firms involved in this saga include GameStop Corp. (NYSE: [GME](https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/gamestop%20corp/1326380/)), AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: [AMC](https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/amc%20entertainment%20holdings%20inc/1411579/)), ContextLogic Inc. (NASDAQ: [WISH](https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/contextlogic%20inc/1822250/)), and Clover Health Investments, Corp. (NASDAQ: [CLOV](https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/clover%20health%20investments%20corp%20de/1801170/)), among others. According to some media reports, hedge funds have suffered a total of $12 billion in losses in these short-selling schemes. Investment bank Goldman Sachs last year compiled an index of stocks that these retail investors favored. That index has doubled in value over the past few months.\n\nIn an analysis, released to clients earlier this month, the investment bank [highlighted](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-analysis-retail-investors-plowing-400-billion-into-stocks-2021-6) that the retail favorites index had beaten the overall market by three percentage points this month. The analysis also underlined that retail investor spending into equities was poised to rise to $400 billion this year, an increase of $50 billion from a previous estimate of $350 billion. Perhaps this is one reason why hedge funds have been actively monitoring the hype around certain companies on Reddit in order to better manage their risk profiles.\n\nThe battle, though, still looks to be far from over. According to Goldman Sachs, the retail investor boom in equities is just beginning. Hedge funds managers, like Andrew Left, who expected retail investors to jump ship and drive the price of shorted stocks down, have been left red-faced as the prices of these stocks \u2014 referred to as meme stocks \u2014 continues to soar higher. However, in addition to being active, these stocks have been some of the most volatile ones on the market, adding to the overall chaos in the market.\n\nThe entire hedge fund industry is feeling the reverberations of the changing financial landscape. Its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade, during which its hedged returns couldn\u2019t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand, Insider Monkey\u2019s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&amp;P 500 ETFs by more than 124 percentage points since March 2017. Between March 2017 and February 26th 2021 our monthly newsletter\u2019s stock picks returned 197.2%, vs. 72.4% for the SPY. Our stock picks outperformed the market by more than 124 percentage points (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16th. That\u2019s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

These were ranked keeping in mind the overall losses, size of the hedge fund, and the market credence of the hedge fund manager. The hedge funds that suffered losses, either directly or indirectly, as a result of the short squeezes but did not shutter completely have also been included in this list.\n\n**Biggest Hedge Fund Casualties of Reddit WallStreetBets' Short Squeezes**\n\n**10. Citron Capital**\n\nAndrew Left, the editor of investment newsletter *Citron Research*, is one of the most famous short-sellers on the market. His hedge fund was one of the biggest losers in the GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) short squeeze. Citron is placed tenth on our list of 10 biggest hedge fund casualties of Reddit WallStreetBets' short squeezes. Left took to video sharing website YouTube in January to [assure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS4yPsmaDDQ) investors in Citron Capital that he had made a mistake in predicting that GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) stock would lower in price.\n\nLeft clarified that Citron had managed to cover the short positions on GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) at a 100% loss, learning important lessons in the process. However, Left, in the video, said that he expected the stock of the video game retailer to return back to normal levels within a short span of time. This prediction has not aged well, as the stock is still trading at a high price, despite pulling back from record highs registered in January.\n\n**9.** [**Maverick Capital**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/hedge-fund/maverick-capital/17/)\n\nMaverick Capital is an investment firm run from Texas. It is placed ninth on our list of 10 biggest hedge fund casualties of Reddit WallStreetBets' short squeezes. The hedge fund is run by Lee Ainslie and manages over $10 billion in assets. Earlier this month, *Financial Times* [reported](https://www.ft.com/content/dcd86860-09ed-420e-a5cc-d6d281863c03) that Maverick Capital was keeping track of the hype around certain stocks on Reddit forums in order to protect itself from short squeezes, lending credence to earlier reports that the hedge fund had suffered losses in the GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) saga at the turn of the year.\n\nMaverick Capital holds a large stake in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), the ecommerce retailer based in Washington. Out of the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, London-based investment firm [Citadel Investment Group](https://www.insidermonkey.com/hedge-fund/citadel+investment+group/44/) is a leading shareholder in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) with 3.3 million shares worth more than $10.5 billion.\n\nJust like GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC), ContextLogic Inc. (NASDAQ: WISH), and Clover Health Investments, Corp. (NASDAQ: CLOV), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) is one of the stocks to watch out for this year.\n\nIn its Q1 2021 investor letter, Hayden Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: [AMZN](https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/amazon%20com%20inc/1018724/)) was one of them. [Here](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/is-amazon-com-amzn-a-great-investment-choice-943917/) is what the fund said:\n\n&gt;*\u201cAmazon (AMZN): We sold our last remaining stake in Amazon this quarter. Amazon was our longest-running investment holding, after having originally purchasing it at the inception of Hayden in 2014, at a price of \\~$317.*  \n*I gave some details of how Amazon has progressed over these past 6.5 years in last year\u2019s Q2 2020 letter, which partners can find here (LINK). The company has executed amazingly well over this tenure, with revenues up \\~3.3x and since our initial purchase, and reported operating income up \\~30x over that period.*  \n*Generally, I believe there are three reasons to sell an investment: 1) we recognize our initial thesis is wrong (sell out as quick as possible), 2) we have a significantly higher returning opportunity to redeploy the capital into (sell-down to fund the new investment), or 3) the company is maturing and hitting the top part of it\u2019s S-curve / business lifecycle, so the business has fewer places to reinvest its capital internally. As such, the future returns will likely be lower than the past. This investment thus becomes a \u201csource of capital\u201d in the future, as we fund earlier-stage investment opportunities...\" (*[*Click here to view the full text*](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/is-amazon-com-amzn-a-great-investment-choice-943917/)*)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **8.** [**Citadel Investment Group**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/hedge-fund/citadel-investment-group/44/)\n\nCitadel Investment Group is an investment management company registered in Chicago. It is ranked eighth on our list of 10 biggest hedge fund casualties of Reddit WallStreetBets' short squeezes. The hedge fund is run by billionaire Ken Griffin and has a portfolio value of over $400 billion, one of the biggest in the world. Although the fund was not directly impacted by the Reddit-backed short squeeze, it did help arrange close to $3 billion in capital for Melvin Capital that had been hit hard by the short squeeze.\n\nOne of the top holdings of Citadel Investment Group is Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), the California-based electric vehicle maker. Out of the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Chicago-based investment firm[ Citadel Investment Group](https://www.insidermonkey.com/hedge-fund/citadel+investment+group/44/) is a leading shareholder in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) with 24.4 million shares worth more than $16.3 billion.\n\nJust like GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC), ContextLogic Inc. (NASDAQ: WISH), and Clover Health Investments, Corp. (NASDAQ: CLOV), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) is one of the stocks to watch out for this year.\n\nHere is what Baron Partners Fund has to say about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: [TSLA](https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/tesla%20inc/1318605/)) in its Q1 2021 investor letter:\n\n&gt;*\u201cTesla, Inc. designs, manufactures, and sells fully electric vehicles, solar products, energy storage solutions, and battery cells. The stock fell during the quarter as a result of general market dynamics and a potential production slowdown due to parts shortages. A refreshed S/X and China Model Y ramp could also have a negative impact on margins in early 2021. We anticipate strong growth and improved margins driven by new production capacity, manufacturing efficiencies, localization of its manufacturing and supply chain, and maturation of Tesla\u2019s full self-driving technology.*\n\n**7.** [**Candlestick Capital Management**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/hedge-fund/candlestick-capital-management/1231/)\n\nCandlestick Capital Management is a hedge fund headquartered in Connecticut. It is placed seventh on our list of 10 biggest hedge fund casualties of Reddit WallStreetBets' short squeezes. The fund is run by Jack Woodruff and manages more than $4 billion in assets, according to latest filings. The fund was a big gainer in 2020, gaining a handsome 26% over the pandemic period, but suffered low to midteen percentage losses in the Reddit-backed short squeeze earlier this year, per a [report](https://www.wsj.com/articles/several-hedge-funds-stung-by-market-turmoil-11611842693) in business news publication *The Wall Street Journal*.\n\nCandlestick Capital Management has invested heavily in Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE: MA), the New York-based payments processing firm. Out of the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Virginia-based investment firm [Akre Capital Management ](https://www.insidermonkey.com/hedge-fund/akre+capital+management/103/)is a leading shareholder in Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE: MA) with 5.8 million shares worth more than $2 billion.\n\nJust like GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC), ContextLogic Inc. (NASDAQ: WISH), and Clover Health Investments, Corp. (NASDAQ: CLOV), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE: MA) is one of the stocks to watch out for this year.\n\nIn its Q4 2020 investor letter, Bretton Fund, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE: [MA](https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/mastercard%20inc/1141391/)) was one of them. [Here](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/should-you-buy-these-2-financial-services-stocks-before-its-too-late-922927/) is what the fund said:\n\n&gt;*\u201cWhile consumers resumed much of their spending by summer, what and how they used their Visas and Mastercards changed. For obvious reasons, people shifted to contactless payments\u2014one of the Covid-era changes we think is permanent\u2014and replaced travel purchases with online shopping and food delivery. Consumers spent more on their debit cards and less on their credit cards; Visa and Mastercard make more per transaction on the latter. They also make more on cross-border transactions that come mostly from international travel, which ground to a halt early in the pandemic. Visa\u2019s and Mastercard\u2019s earnings per share fell by 7% and 16%, respectively, compared to their usual mid-teens growth. We\u2019re not too worried, and we think they\u2019ll catch up nicely in the post-vaccine world. Visa\u2019s stock returned 17.1% and Mastercard\u2019s 20.2%.\u201d*\n\n**6.** [**Point72 Asset Management**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/hedge-fund/point72-asset-management/750/)\n\nPoint72 Asset Management is a Connecticut-based hedge fund. It is ranked sixth on our list of 10 biggest hedge fund casualties of Reddit WallStreetBets' short squeezes. The fund is managed by Steven Cohen and is one of the biggest in the US, managing more than $21 billion in assets at the end of March, according to latest filings. *The New York Times* [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/01/27/business/us-economy-coronavirus/point72-gamestop) in February that the fund lost 15% during the GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) short squeeze in January. The fund also helped finance a multi-billion dollar bailout for Melvin Capital this year.\n\nOne of the premier holdings of Point72 Asset Management is Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ: BIDU), the Chinese technology company. At the end of the first quarter of 2021, 89 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $6.5 billion in Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ: BIDU), up from 51 in the preceding quarter worth $4.6 billion.\n\nJust like GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC), ContextLogic Inc. (NASDAQ: WISH), and Clover Health Investments, Corp. (NASDAQ: CLOV), Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ: BIDU) is one of the stocks to watch out for this year.\n\nIn its Q1 2021 investor letter, Horos Asset Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ: [BIDU](https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/baidu+inc/1329099/)) was one of them. [Here](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/heres-why-horos-asset-management-sold-its-baidu-bidu-stake-943425/) is what the fund said:\n\n&gt;*\u201cWe have also fully exited our stake in Baidu, following their outstanding performance during the period and their lower relative upside potential compared to other investment alternatives, which we will discuss below.*  \n*The Chinese technology platform company Baidu has also been held in the portfolios managed by Alejandro, Miguel and myself for several years. During this period, we have seen very high volatility in its share price, which we have taken advantage of to make significant rebalancing moves in our position (in fact, we even sold our entire position once, when we thought the stock\u2019s upside potential was exhausted). After several years of instability, market sentiment turned very positive, putting an end to the historical advertising problems in the healthcare sector, the divestments in O2O (Online-to-Offline) businesses that continued to weigh on the company\u2019s margins, the IPO of part of the iQiyi streaming business (which hid Baidu\u2019s underlying cash generation capacity) and the tough competition from other industry giants such as Tencent and Alibaba, as well as the entry of new players with disruptive business models (ByteDance). At the same time, the company\u2019s recent commitment to electric vehicles contributed even more to this change of narrative. Baidu\u2019s share price rose almost fourfold from the March 2020 lows to all-time highs and reached a valuation where the margin of safety, in our view, was too narrow.\u201d*\n\n **5.** [**D1 Capital Partners**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/hedge-fund/d1-capital-partners/1063/)\n\nD1 Capital Partners is a hedge fund managed from New York. It is placed fifth on our list of 10 biggest hedge fund casualties of Reddit WallStreetBets\u2019 short squeezes. The fund manages more than $13 billion in assets at the end of the first quarter of 2021. It is run by Dan Sundheim. News publication *Bloomberg* [claims](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/dan-sundheim-s-20-billion-d1-capital-loses-about-20-this-month) that the fund took a 20% hit in the short-selling saga involving GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) in January. D1 was one of the best-performing funds in 2020, finishing the year with a 60% gain and $20 billion in assets under management.\n\nD1 Capital Partners has invested a lot of money in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), the Washington based technology company that sells computer software and services. Out of the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Washington-based investment firm [Fisher Asset Managemen](https://www.insidermonkey.com/hedge-fund/fisher+asset+management/11/)t is a leading shareholder in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT)\u00a0 with 23.9 million shares worth more than $5.6 billion.\n\nIn its Q1 2021 investor letter, Polen Capital, an investment management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: [MSFT](https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/microsoft%20corp/789019/)) was one of them. [Here](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/should-you-consider-investing-in-microsoft-msft-943062/) is what the fund said:\n\n&gt;\u201cWe have written extensively about Microsoft in recent commentaries. It was our leading contributor last year and one of our largest weightings within the Portfolio. It continues to experience business momentum through several dominant, essential, and competitively advantaged businesses, like Office 365 and Azure. The markets it competes for are enormous, which gives the company the ability to compound at scale. In the past quarter alone, the company generated over $40 billion in revenue, representing a 17% growth rate. The inherent operating leverage in Microsoft\u2019s business model continues and led to 34% earnings growth this past quarter. Despite the broad rotation we saw in the first quarter and Microsoft\u2019s robust performance in 2020, we think its business fundamentals continue to exhibit strength, and the stock continues to reflect the fundamentals.\u201d\n\n **4.** [**Maplelane Capital**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/hedge-fund/maplelane-capital/546/)\n\nMaplelane Capital is an investment firm run from New York.

In late January, news publication *Bloomberg* [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/hedge-fund-maplelane-loses-about-33-on-short-bets-this-month) that the fund had lost 33% in a single month after a failed attempt to short-sell GameStop Corp.

Light Street Capital, according to *Financial Times*, [managed](https://www.ft.com/content/ca1090ba-c3aa-446c-8406-7ce0e01bb510) over $3 billion in assets at the start of the year. This figure has since fallen to $1.8 billion, with losses primarily driven by short-selling attempts in January and May.\n\nOne of the biggest holdings of Light Street Capital is Facebook, Inc.

We also made adjustments to the portfolio\u2019s top 10 holdings to increase the participation of select stocks, including Facebook, while trimming our weighting to stable names, which now represent 47% of the portfolio.

What gave us confidence in purchasing Expedia were the actions the company took to extend out their balance sheets until travel resumed. It should benefit as a broader vaccination rollout prompts cruise lines to resume operations and consumers to start traveling again and are positioned to deliver better margins and gain pricing power as the economy normalizes due to the cost controls implemented during the downturn.\u201d\n\n **1.** [**White Square Capita**l](https://www.insidermonkey.com/hedge-fund/white-square-capital/1020/)\n\nWhite Square Capital is a London-based investment management firm.

[Here](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/harding-loevner-on-walt-disney-dis-theres-fight-left-in-this-old-dog-929397/) is what the fund said:\n\n&gt;\u201cOne of the original constituents of the Nifty Fifty holds a place in our portfolio today. When we bought Disney three years ago, we wrote that \u201cwe view Disney theme parks in the US, Europe, and China as resistant to online substitution.\u201d We did not reckon on a pandemic, which closed all of them, and sent all of usto our couches. Disney, however, wasready for us, brilliantly illustrating the importance of management foresight and change management. Or, as Louis Pasteur said, \u201cchance favors the prepared mind.  \nA century after its founding in 1923, Disney is in the middle of a bold shift from its legacy media networks &amp; entertainment model\u2014with cable TV, theme parks, and theater films dominating its earnings\u2014to a direct-to-consumer streaming media model. The keys to Disney\u2019s transition: matchless storytelling, coupled with financial strength. The company reliably creates content that people all over the world are eager to consume. It also hastened spending on original content to attract subscribers to its new streaming platform. These factors have allowed Disney to weather the pandemic having expanded its direct engagement with customers. Such connections yield a rich harvest of insights used to customize offerings on a mass scale, reinforcing that engagement in a virtuous circle and thereby raising the lifetime value of each customer. Subscribers to Disney+ reached 86.8 million one year after launch, compared to the 60 \u2013 90 million management projected to reach in 2024. To be sure, Netflix, Apple, and Amazon remain formidable competitors in new-era streaming entertainment (mind what we said about everyone standing up at once), but there\u2019s fight left in this old dog.\u201d\u00a0",

        "selftext": "Posting here to offer a little perspective on what some apes saw as a quick hype play.\n\nIt was evident that PSFE had finally found bottom last week after months of daily short attacks.  For months, we saw all the tell-tale signs of market manipulators expertly shaking out retail shareholders with order flow, short volume, massive block trades and 13F\u2019s showing institutions steadily loading up.  In this context, just as PSFE was to be officially added to the Russell 1000 and 3000 indexes, it seemed a little suspicious that Paysafe was suddenly being hyped and trending on WallStreetBets.  I had to wonder if this was an engineered event to generate more liquidity since market makers were clearly running out of sellers right when they had to fill a lot more institutional orders.\n\nThat\u2019s all just monkey brain theory that ultimately doesn't matter because my plan is to hold PSFE long-term.  There is a clear strategy with this company that will take some time to come to fruition and I want to be in on the ground floor, before all the rosy ER\u2019s come in.  With a fintech that does roughly as much transactional volume as Square and, despite recent reports, has similar growth to PayPal, it\u2019s no surprise that institutions want to accumulate at levels so low that the stock is almost completely de-risked from a long-term perspective.\n\nThe comprehensive DD below is for the diamond handed apes who may have been caught in the recent hype. Know that you\u2019re not alone. We saw the same thing right after CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer called Paysafe, \u201cthe ultimate stock for this moment\u201d and market analyst Steve Grasso repeated his calls for it go to \u201c$45/$50 and then settle in before moving higher from there.\u201d  After initial spikes, deep-pocketed short-sellers methodically crushed retail holders, eventually bringing the price down to where it was last week.\n\nBut informed short sellers knew they couldn't push too far because that price was really not far from the price paid by noted fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 10 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares) and Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares).  A price probably lower than paid by Wells Fargo\u2019s several funds (12 million shares) and even by Blackstone when they raised their initial stake of 123 million shares to a total of 160 million shares.^(1)  Also, it\u2019s worth noting that, since they all decided to invest, Paysafe has created significant value including securing new revenue streams in the US iGaming market and expanded partnerships with Coinbase, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, and Microsoft among others. ^(2)\n\nWith a presence in 120 countries, Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor: #1 global leader in iGaming, #2 global digital wallet, #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. Ever since private equity groups Blackstone and CVC took Paysafe private, they\u2019ve been going through a major restructuring to reduce risk, increase margins and profits. It's because they are still very much in the middle of that process that I like it so much as an investment opportunity. Here are a few key points:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* In 2017, private equity groups Blackstone and CVC raised their bid five times to ultimately to take Paysafe private for $3.9 billion.^(3)  Blackstone says their typical investment term is \u201cupwards of 7-10 years\u201d ^(4) which aligns with the investment time-frame implied by an inside source close to those negotiations who said, \u201cThere is a fundamental change in the way we pay for goods and services, away from the cash and cheques of our parents\u2019 age,\u201d adding that the private equity firms \u201chave a decade-long thesis that this shift will only grow and grow and they want to get in now.\u201d ^(5)\n* Under Blackstone/CVC\u2019s stewardship, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). Last year, due to Covid-related brick-and-mortar business and sporting event closures, along with their long-standing strategic decision to exit specific high-risk Asian revenue channels, 2020 revenue stagnated.  This is the reason they recently reported only 5% YoY quarterly growth.  In their Q1 ER, management noted that, without those channel exits they would have reported growth in the \u201cmid to high teens.\u201d  But even if you include 2020\u2019s stagnant growth, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s current projected growth. ^(6,7)\n* A few months ago, Paysafe was brought public through a reverse merger transaction with acclaimed deal maker Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity. The deal paid down $1.2 billion in debt and gave Blackstone/CVC about $5.6 billion in cash and shares.^(8)  The fact that Blackstone's recent 13F shows they bought back 37 million shares, combined with statements from them and Paysafe's board, indicates that they did this deal, not for a mere 44% gain on a four year investment, but because Bill Foley is an extraordinarily successful and well-connected deal maker who has a proven track record for generating exponential growth.\n* Inorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe\u2019s strategy going forward.  Bill Foley, now Chairman of Paysafe and a major shareholder, is a proven M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena.  Foley took Fidelity National Financial from $3 million market cap to $10.8 billion. Yeah, that\u2019s and \u201cm\u201d and a \u201cb\u201d.  Over just the last five years, Foley grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).  Through his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion market cap. That\u2019s a 36x return.  He says  \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d ^(6,9)\n\n**Deleveraging, increasing margins and profit**\n\n* Paysafe recently confirmed they are on track to meet 2021 projections of $1.53 billion in revenue, $930-$970 million in gross profit, double-digit growth and expanding 30-35% EBITDA margins, and $103 billion in transactional volume.  Paysafe\u2019s already strong $362 million in 2020 free cash flow was reported to be on track for 29% growth in 2021.  Notably, their multi-year projections don\u2019t include growth from their \"active M&amp;A pipeline\" and their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR).\n* Q1's earnings disappointed some because, as part of their restructuring, they had $90 million in one-time non-recurring expenses associated with the merger and paying down $1.2 billion in debt. The company noted: \u201cResults included interest expense of $58.5 million, an increase of 53% compared to the prior year, reflecting the expense of capitalized debt fees as a result of debt repayment on March 31, 2021. Net loss also included share-based compensation of $72.4 million, compared to none in the prior year due to shares vested on completion of the Transaction.\"\n* Take away the $90 million in one-time expenses and, rather than reporting a $49 million loss, the company would have reported $41 million in quarterly net profit, thereby beating all analyst estimates. All signs indicate they are on track to beat estimates going forward, although I have noticed a few platforms raising those estimates recently.\n* In addition to paying down $1.2 billion in debt, an improved Moody\u2019s credit rating has enabled the company to refinance roughly a billion at a 1.25% lower interest rate, with an option to reduce it another 25bp.^(10)  Foley says: \u201cOne of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe\u2019s leverage ratio to 3.6x Debt/EBITDA.\u201d  Notably, this Debt/EBITDA ratio is far better than the majority of their fintech peers, and the resulting improved margins stand to make it better still.\n* The combined effect of overall recent debt management will be a savings of around $92 million annually.  This secures higher margins, increased cash for M&amp;A and higher profits which, in my view, will lead to raised price targets and positive price action catalysts.\n* As part of their restructuring to cut down on operating expenses and further increase margins, Paysafe has recently forged agreements with Snowflake and AWS as they move to cloud-based integration for easier migration between their platforms, easier cross-border payments and planned expansion into global banking as a service, having identified a $58 trillion TAM.\n\n**Highly competitve**\n\n* Unlike other payment processors, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY.  Just today, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.\n* In various segments, Paysafe has recently expanded their partnerships with FOX bet, Roblox, Fortnight, Coinbase, Amazon, Twitch, Microsoft/Xbox, bet365, ApplePay, Draftkings, Spotify, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, Amelco, BetMGM, Ceasar\u2019s, and Pointsbet among many others.\n* \\#4 globally in integrated merchant processing, Paysafe\u2019s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n* They are #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n* People are usually more likely to leave reviews when a payment platform doesn\u2019t meet their expectations. That said, Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe\u2019s digital wallet Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). ^(11)\n   * By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as \u201cAverage 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). ^(12)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2tce80abpl871.png?width=475&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32e78dde014d5edf387cd4f9f603fceb6ab6c4c7\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d**\n\n**\u201cIt\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\"** \\- Bill Foley\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter, due to managing risk and a very complex regulatory landscape. Paysafe\u2019s advantage here is a large aspect of its MOAT, as discussed below.  Paysafe is often an integrated back-end payment processor so most don\u2019t realize they are using it but they are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion in the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting.\n* Bill Foley says, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else\u2026we\u2019re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting\u201d\n* In his letter to investors, fund manager Dan Loeb said, \u201cWe believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.\u201d\n* Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso, who initiated coverage with a $19 price target, noted, \u201cPSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,\u201d adding, \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d ^(13)\n   * Recent headlines since Del Grasso wrote that:\n      * \"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\n      * \"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\n      * \u201cNew Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\n      * \"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\n      * \"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\n      * \u201dDelaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March\"\n      * \"Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%\"\n      * \u201cCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\n      * \u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\n      * \u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\n      * \u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\n      * \u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\n      * \u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\n      * \u201cFlorida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal\u201d\n      * \u201cLegal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think\u201d\n      * \u201cCanada legalizes single-game sports betting\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Every analyst covering Paysafe rates it as a \"Buy\". A few quotes :\n   * RBC Capital 5-star analyst Daniel Perlin: \u201cWe believe PSFE offers a unique combination of digital wallet capabilities, accelerated cash conversion for consumers who would otherwise be out of the ecommrece loop, and integrated payments, all focused on specialized &amp; complex end-markets, which creates a competitive moat and pricing power.\u201d \u201crecent underperformance is largely due to the complex nature of PSFE\u2019s business and the FTAC II transaction\u201d and adds his view that Paysafe offers one of the best combinations of services in online payment space: \u201cPSFE has created a unique two-sided network enabling merchants to accept online &amp; in-store payments (in specific niche verticals), while also offering consumers a digital wallet &amp; eCash solution, which converts cash-heavy users to digital users. We believe it\u2019s this combination that enables PSFE to generate superior take rate economics vs. peers.\u201d ^(14)\n   * BMO Capital, 5-star analyst, James Fotheringham: \u201cPSFE is a global leader in iGaming (online betting related to sports, poker, and other casino games, as well as lotteries and bingo). Indeed, 36% of PSFE\u2019s revenues are from global iGaming. That is far more than for any of its peers.\u201d iGaming deposit volumes in the U.S. will grow \u201cat more than five times the rate of growth elsewhere in the world\u201d with a \"5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of between 40% to 55%.\" ^(15)\n   * Evercore ISI analyst David Togut 'praised Paysafe for its \u201crobust risk management operation,\u201d and its high rankings in several key performance indictors globally, including cash network, stored digital wallet value, and amount of partnered independent merchants.' ^(16)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MOAT:**  **\u201crobust risk management operation\u201d**\n\nSo why does Paysafe dominate iGaming and why how is it able offer eCommerce services to the 1.7 billion globally who can't even manage to have bank accounts or credit cards?\n\nTheir industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from transcript : \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players\u2026we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can\u2019t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we\u2019re not only talking about take rates and comps, we\u2019re talking about revenue-generation, we\u2019re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That\u2019s a really, really powerful position to have.\u201d ^(9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Valuation:**\n\nA while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.\n\n* Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin,  mid to high teen EBITDA growth, and $362 million in free cash flow (now on track to increase 29%),\n* By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.\n* Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.\n* The group's collective growth rate of \\~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account their current expansion into US iGaming nor do they factor in their \"active M&amp;A pipeline.\"  Foley is apparently known for under-promising and over-performing.\n* As noted above, Paysafe was growing 28% CAGR pre-Covid, but taking into account last years slow down due to Covid-related business closures and strategic channel exits, it grew at 18% CAGR, a rate on par with PayPal's projected growth.\n\nGiven all the above factors, it seems fair to look at Paysafe's potential price based on an average of peer multiples:\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\nMore realistic price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : **$50.75**\n* EV/Rev ratio : **$44.64**\n* EV/FCF ratio : **$44.18**\n\n**Average : $46.52**\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe\u2019s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up.  While I don't necessarily agree with his time frame, market analyst Steve Grasso's call for \"$45/55\" may actually be quite reasonable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sources:**\n\n(1) [https://fintel.io/so/us/psfe](https://fintel.io/so/us/psfe).\n\n(2) [https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/oak2jx/paysafes\\_value\\_creation\\_trajectory\\_is\\_very\\_much/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/oak2jx/paysafes_value_creation_trajectory_is_very_much/)\n\n(3) [https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackstone-cvc-to-buy-paysafe-for-3-9-billion-in-latest-online-payments-deal-1501830827](https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackstone-cvc-to-buy-paysafe-for-3-9-billion-in-latest-online-payments-deal-1501830827)\n\n(4) [https://pws.blackstone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/the\\_life\\_cycle\\_of\\_private\\_equity\\_insights.pdf](https://pws.blackstone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/the_life_cycle_of_private_equity_insights.pdf)\n\n(5) [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-paysafe-group-m-a-idUSKBN1AK0KN](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-paysafe-group-m-a-idUSKBN1AK0KN)\n\n(6) [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm)\n\n(7) [https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst\\_Day\\_presentation\\_March\\_9\\_\\_2021.pdf](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst_Day_presentation_March_9__2021.pdf)\n\n(8) [https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/)\n\n(9)  [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm)\n\n(10)   [https://www.globalcapital.com/article/b1s344yyc1zccx/paysafe-preps-post-spac-refi](https://www.globalcapital.com/article/b1s344yyc1zccx/paysafe-preps-post-spac-refi)\n\n(11) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com)\n\n(12) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com)\n\n(13)  [https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html](https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html)\n\n(14) [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04)\n\n(15) [https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/](https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/)\n\n(16) [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html)",
