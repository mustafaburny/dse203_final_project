        "selftext": "When you look at the hot section of wsb on a given weekday, at least half of the hot posts are a screenshot of someones position, usually a yolo. These are entertaining, and generally we consider these as proof of positions. But they shouldn't be. I'm no inspect element or photoshop expert but it wouldn't be too difficult to fabricate postions simply for internet clout (\"oh look at me! I have 500k in the game!!!\"). \n\nI consider this an issue, simply because false claims are essentially fraud in the financial world, which could be damaging for this sub, legally damaging for the individuals doing the fabricating, and influential for those who believe all these posts are real.  \n\nSo i am not sure if this issue has been discussed before seriously, but I believe it has to be brought up. We need better ways to authenticate positions. I don't exactly have the answers to this. Maybe we are living in an age where deep fakes are just so good that wr may never tell (see the fbi issuing a warning about deep fakes of zoom calls for businesses). But there has to be some way, while keeping anonymity. Screen recordings appear to be harder to fake and thus more believable but that's not a 100% fix as i believr there are again ways around it. \n\nAt the very least, if you are looking at positions/yolos posted here, be skeptical. Yes some people have a lot of money to throw around, but there are definitely fake posts rising to the top just because the numbers are big. Do your due dilligence not just in a stock, but on the posts you see here. \n\nOnly you can prevent forest fires",

        "selftext": "\u201c\u201cThe tendies are coming, the tendies are coming\u201d \u2013 Paul Revere\u201d\u201d \u2013 HomeDepotHank69\n\nApes, I have excellent news. Today, I woke up (with only a half chub) and thought to myself \u201cI\u2019m gonna be super productive today and get a ton of work done.\u201d Then, my ADHD medicine kicked in and I went down another GME rabbit hole. Here is the product of that (I will warn you, this is long):\n\nI have done a lot of digging and have found some extraordinary similarities from last year\u2019s annual meeting of stockholders to this one and why it and the months leading up to it should be HUGE for GME. This is not a technical analysis, this is pure DD. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice.\n\nJust a note: you can find all of these documents simply by searching \u201cGamestop Notice of 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders\u201d on Google, I just picked out the important parts to make it easier.\n\n**History**\n\nI am first going to start with GME\u2019s share price as of April 2020:\n\n*Processing img 8vdfrd67c0r61...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can see, on April 3rd, 2020, GME\u2019s price bottomed to under $2. This was due to Covid absolutely crushing the company and shorters seeking to hit the \u201cbankruptcy jackpot.\u201d However, on April 3rd and the next few days, we see the price of GME almost triple all the way up to $6. Why was this? Some of you may remember Michael Burry announced his GME position in April 2020. Well, that\u2019s not what caused this rise as Burry announced his stake on Friday the 10th, which caused a rise on Monday the 13th:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2nex5908c0r61.png?width=1388&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de67e9bdd2d979c91dc9bb43bc53b2a12da68ae9\n\nSo if it wasn\u2019t Michael Burry\u2019s announcement of his position, then what was it? Was it the announcement of the annual shareholder\u2019s meeting? Nope, that was announced in late April as well:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ng9w1hn8c0r61.png?width=1308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80752e0a42df99f79379699efda585b273c938b3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, if it wasn\u2019t either of those things, then what was it? The drastic rise in GME starting April 3rd, 2020 (which seems pathetic compared to today\u2019s price action) was due to a group of activist investors, Hestia Capital, who owned 7.5% of GME at the time announcing that they would be nominating new members of the board at the shareholders meeting. When was this letter released? April 3rd, 2020:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y9fc9ul9c0r61.png?width=1380&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2203bb2a004f5510f8d37d0e0415f26a165233b2\n\nWhy is this significant? Well, for some reason it was pretty well known that GME\u2019s short interest was over 100% at this time (still blows my mind that more people didn\u2019t pounce on this at the time, myself included). Again, this was because Covid was destroying GME and shorts were looking to get the \u201cbankruptcy jackpot.\u201d I believe that this is when shorts were deploying massive amounts of naked shorts. Their reasoning was that if they pushed GME into bankruptcy, they wouldn\u2019t have to repay the naked shorts because the company wouldn\u2019t exist anymore (this is just a theory but it seems reasonable considering what\u2019s happened today). Shorts took a calculated risk that they thought would pay off. Their reasoning was that at the best they hit the bankruptcy jackpot and at the worst they stock goes up a little and they take a slight loss due to the naked shorts (boy were they wrong on that one). Well, their plan almost worked. They got it down to under $3. Then, this statement came out. Why is that statement significant? Well, this letter explicitly stated that GME has high short interest and that in order to vote, shareholders need to recall their shares from anyone who has them on loan before the date of April 20, 2020:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pc0t84fac0r61.png?width=1376&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44b6abff32b7961952a48798d464c491f3c7a445\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLook back at the GME chart that I posted at the top of this. BOOM. This company announces that and people start recalling their shares, forcing some shorts to cover. GME\u2019s massive short interest at this time was already well known:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p0046h2bc0r61.png?width=1326&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffee6642fffdc657bb343467eff365a777f9bb84\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom that point on, GME's price never even got close to that $3 range again:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b5gn9tubc0r61.png?width=1304&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a73405eb69dce6967d5a7a95684f6fcd1e1fb484\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI couldn\u2019t include the rest of the chart because it makes these moves seem insignificant because of GME\u2019s massive price today. This is where the shorts should\u2019ve thrown in the towel and taken the loss, but they didn\u2019t. They kept shorting GME and, as we all know, the short interest eventually hit 140% and the January events happened. And know we\u2019re here, exactly 1 year later to the tee. The rest of this post will be going over the similarities of this period last year to today and my thoughts on what might happen.\n\n**Similarities**\n\nSo, as stated above, GME\u2019s price rose so rapidly on April 3rd because of that proxy statement urging shareholders to recall their shares. This, which was simply an urging, not a full recall, lead to an almost 3x increase in price in just a few days. Imagine if GME does a forced recall of the shares this time around: BOOM.\n\nThe first similarity is the presence of activist investors trying to make a fundamental change to GME as a company. The 2020 activist investor that I mentioned above, Hestia Capital, was what Ryan Cohen currently is. From the proxy statement, we can see that Hestia was actively trying to replace people on the GME board of directors for their inaction and ineffectiveness:\n\n*Processing img adj3y4edc0r61...*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yzjcp6edc0r61.png?width=1324&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3081f2c2f5034871461197e61f6b6e0e1855e1c0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/desngdedc0r61.png?width=1348&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d66cfdecd99b8f97de088f16ab4dcab54aad716b\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, note that the whole point of this proxy letter was Hestia announcing that they are nominating people to the board for the 2020 meeting and that shareholders need to vote. Does this feel any similar to Cohen getting on the board, ousting the C.F.O., and bringing on Chewey and Amazon execs?\n\nThroughout the letter, Hestia documents the reasons for their desire to change the board and documents a history of the events leading up to it. This is far too much information to screenshot, but I encourage you to read it for yourself: [https://news.gamestop.com/node/17596/html](https://news.gamestop.com/node/17596/html) (Search \u201creasons for the solicitation\u201d and \u201cbackground of the solicitation\u201d within the document to find these points).\n\nTo recap, we have the presence of an activist investor trying to shake up the board of GME, GME having a massive short interest, naked/abusive shorting activity, the annual shareholders meeting being in June (last year it was June 12th, this year it is June 11th), and an activist investor trying to change the fundamental direction of the company. All of this went down in April and was related to the shareholders meeting in June.\n\nSounds pretty similar to today right? But what\u2019s the difference? Ryan Cohen is a much stronger activist investor, seems to have more power in the company, has a clearer vision than Hestia, and is making changes more aggressively. Another difference is obviously GME\u2019s price, media coverage, and volume. The short squeeze has made GME a hot media topic, the price is multiples higher than it was a year ago (almost 200x), and the volume (though lower recently) is still MUCH higher than it was one year ago (see any GME chart and compare the volume). But there\u2019s one more difference that is crucial. There is an odd phenomenon in GME today. A strange primate whose scientific name is hominoidea, whose hands are strong as diamonds, and whose wives have endless boyfriends. Yes, I am talking about apes. The uncanny ability of apes to buy and hold throughout any storm has created a sort of wall of support on GME that makes it very hard for shorts to kill the price. Combine that with another strange creature, whose scientific name is Cetacea, who has deep pockets and a symbiotic relationship with hominoidea. This is our whale. This symbiotic relationship means that the shorts are toast (I\u2019m not even joking here, apes have created a wall of support, we have power). Combine all of this with the abusive shorting, failure to deliver cycle, statutory leverage ratio relief not being extended, and new DTCC/SEC regulations on abusive shorting and you have a recipe for tendies.\n\n**The future**\n\nSo, I broke down the past, showed you the similarities, and talked about the present. Now what? Well, here are my thoughts on how the potential GME shareholder\u2019s meeting and the months leading up to it could affect the stock:\n\nFirst, I want to echo what everyone else says about dates and predictions - they are not set in stone, do not base your strategy off of them, and do not treat them as fact as it could lead to more doubt among newer apes. This is not a prediction, this is simply a date/time to keep in mind. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. I am Hank. Uncle Hank.\n\nI would like to turn your attention to the week of April 12th and the week of April 19th. This is a 2 week period. As many of you apes know, our golden ticket would be a share recall. A share recall would force shorts to return the borrowed shares of GME to the rightful owners. Obviously, this would literally force the shorts to cover and would lead to massive tendies. As I've said in my previous posts, GME needs volume in order to rise and catalysts are what create volume. As we have seen, GME is particularly sensitive to catalysts, especially those relating to its leadership and Ryan Cohen. This was most evident when GME shot back up from the dead in late February after they announced the ousting of their C.F.O.\n\nThe SEC does not allow a company to recall its shares earlier than 60 days of the shareholder's annual general meeting. Many people hoped a share recall would be announced during earnings (Mar 23), but this would have been a violation of SEC rules, so that was off the table from the start. For context, here are the dates of the past four meetings: June 10, June 26, Jun 10, June 2. This year\u2019s meeting is June 12th or 11th (not sure which but it\u2019s one of those).\n\nLet's use June 11 as our assumption. 60 days prior to June 10th would put us at April 12. Moreover, the tenure of the current C.E.O. also lines up with that date. The current C.E.O. is on a vesting schedule (incentive to stay with a company until a certain date to receive some form of compensation). Per his vesting schedule, he will get 84k shares of GME on April 15th. GME could possibly be waiting until that date to announce Cohen as the C.E.O. (or at the very least to announce that the current C.E.O. is parting ways with the company). Remember when this happened to the C.F.O in February (the price returned from the dead), just imagine how much bigger the rise would be if this announcement was for the C.E.O.\n\nNow, turn your attention back to everything I said above about last year. Maybe GME will announce that they are planning on holding some kind of vote for board positions, or maybe someone with a significant stake in GME (oh Idk maybe Cohen whose stake is almost double what Hestia\u2019s was) could submit a proxy statement similar to Hestia\u2019s which encourages shareholders to recall their shares so they can vote. Or, maybe GME will announce a forced recall for the purposes of voting (GME already acknowledged in their SEC filing that they are aware that their stock still has very high short interest). Maybe this explains why the conference call was so bland: the C.E.O. knows that he\u2019s on the outs and was instructed by the board to give a bare-bones call so they can announce the juicy stuff later when he\u2019s out. OR, maybe there will be more announcements about more board members coming on similar to the recent announcement of the Chewey and Amazon execs. Either way, if any of these announcements require a vote and shares are forcibly recalled or if it is recommended that shareholders recall their shares, then maybe we will see something similar to last year.\n\nThat date (April 15th) is also significant because the monthly options for April are expiring on April 16. Because of that, expect, at the very least, higher volume on that Friday and the Thursday preceding it. This might also explain why the earnings call felt so bare-bones. AT THE VERY LEAST, we will get some kind of good announcement during the shareholders meeting in June, but I would expect something sooner. At this point, I don't see a world where Cohen is not named a C-suite executive of GME. He owns 13% (obviously has a huge personal interest in its success), has recruited Chewey executives (and maybe the person from Amazon as well), and appears to be shaking up the board and other C-suite positions. I would be shocked if he just kinda sat outside the action as the puppet master. He has too much vested in this to not obtain direct power over the situation. It also appears that the company is going in the direction that he wants to take it (e-commerce shift), so it wouldn't make sense for him not to be a C-suite executive at some point. It's also significant that GME has made leadership announcements in each of the past few months (C.F.O. in February, Amazon + Chewey Execs in March), and that it would make sense for another announcement to come in April especially considering last year's activity in April regarding leadership and where Cohen is currently trying to take the company.\n\nAs many of you know DFV's calls expire on that day. At this point, it should be obvious that he is exercising those because if he was gonna just take the profits and rollover the contract, he would've done so much earlier because theta has been eating those. This is again just conjecture, but maybe DFV is waiting until that date to exercise his calls in order to inflict more pain on market makers for failing to deliver shares. This is again just conjecture did research similar to this and came to the conclusion that April 16th would be a crucial day, so he is waiting til then to exercise to put more pressure on the failure to delivers. If you've kept up with his updates, he has plenty of cash on hand so he could easily exercise these. What he could also do is buy more calls (at a later date), which would put obvious upward pressure on the stock. One thing is for certain, he's not going to let those options expire worthless, especially considering the fact that he has millions in cash in his account.\n\nFinally, I also wanted to discuss why I believe that the leadership of GME (at least the new ones) and Cohen are on our side, which is why a share recall would benefit them. First, as we all know, Cohen loves to tweet cryptic stuff (it's actually pretty obvious that it's about GME). A few weeks ago he tweeted that video of the puppet that people deciphered to be about a commercial that said \"I love your shorts.\" Recently he tweeted a vid of TED hitting a bong that people deciphered to mean either bears got smoked or bears took a big hit (this is when it shot up significantly in a day). So, as we all know Cohen is insanely interested in GME and its stock price - and why wouldn't he be, he has 13% ownership (there are also reports of him calling up disgruntled customers asking how he can make their service better). Now, this is why a share recall would benefit GME. There are two different sets of assumptions that we have to work with here: assumption 1 is that the leadership of GME (Cohen included) does not subscribe to the theory that GME is abusively shorted. If we go with this assumption and say that GME is only shorted 25% (boomer data), a share recall benefits them because it will alleviate some of the selling pressure that shorting creates, which will allow the stock to go up. Assumption 2 (the more likely assumption) is that the leadership subscribes to the theory that GME is being abusively shorted. The reason why I believe this is more likely is because of their SEC filing where they addressed that GME has high short interest and that continuing this could cause a short squeeze. This was like when Porsche announced that they had a huge stake in VW to \"warn\" the shorts to cover. If this theory is true, GME is aware that their company is being abusively shorted and is not reflective of the real price of the stock. Therefore, it would be significantly in their interest to recall shares, which would force naked shorts to cover and would DRASTICALLY decrease the downward pressure. Whichever theory they subscribe to, it benefits them immensely to do a recall, and I believe that assumption 2 is far more likely.\n\nYeah I know that was long, rabbit holes will do that to ya.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nOne year ago to the tee, GME\u2019s stock rose on the announcement that an activist investor was having a vote and they recommended shareholders to recall their shares. The short interest was over 100%. The activist investor sought to shakeup management and change the direction of GME. Fast forward to today (exactly 1 year later), and we have an activist investor changing up the company. If GME does a share recall ahead of this meeting or if Cohen releases a proxy statement encouraging shareholders to recall their shares, we could very well see a meteoric rise similar to last year at this time. GME has not provided much information on that meeting, so, similar to last year, updates could come in the month of April. We know that any announcement about leadership changes makes the stock rise.\n\nNot a financial advisor, not financial advice. Am primate.",

        "selftext": "**TL;DR: The US federal government has a massive incentive to underreport inflation. A 1% underreporting of inflation saves the US gov't between $500 billion and $1 trillion per year. It's likely that such a huge moral hazard has led the government to systematically underreport inflation over the past few decades.**\n\nFor background, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) calculates inflation. It releases a measure known as the Consumer Price Index, or CPI. The formula used to calculate CPI is rather complex and opaque, and has been changed numerous times over the years. The effect of these changes has been to lower the average reported inflation number. [\\[1\\]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/consumerpriceindex.asp)\n\nMany government revenues and expenditures are inflation-linked, either directly or indirectly.\n\n**Directly linked:**\n\n1. Social security payments\n\nSocial security payments are linked to a measure known as CPI-W (very similar to the CPI) [\\[2\\]](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/COLA/colasummary.html). Every year, the amount a social security recipient receives goes up in proportion to the amount of inflation. It has been estimated that the social security program has total unfunded liabilities worth \\~**$37 trillion**. Every 1% of underreported inflation decreases the real value of these unfunded liabilities by **$370 billion.**\n\n2) Tax brackets\n\nTax brackets are adjusted upwards to account for inflation [\\[3\\]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/111715/are-tax-brackets-adjusted-inflation.asp). This means, when the government underreports inflation, more people move up into higher tax brackets. It's hard to calculate the exact effect of this on government revenues.\n\n3) Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities\n\nThese are treasuries that increase the amount they pay back, in both interest and principle, according to inflation. They are linked to the CPI. These securities (known as TIPS) compromise \\~8% of the US federal debt [\\[4\\]](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/fin-mkts/Pages/tips.aspx). This is **\\~$2.24 trillion**. Every 1% of underreported inflation decrease the real value of the principle of this debt by **$22 billion.** There are also increases to the interest payments on this debt.\n\n**Indirectly linked:**\n\n1. Debt interest payments\n\nInvestors will demand higher returns from Treasuries in periods where they expect higher inflation. The US government has **\\~$26 trillion** in Treasury debt. The yearly cost of servicing this debt is \\~1-2% of that, roughly **$378 billion** in 2020. If investors were to expect higher inflation, this yearly cost would go up by \\~**$260 billion** for every 1% increase in expected inflation.\n\nThere are likely many other government programs that benefit from underreporting inflation, these are just the main ones I could find. When we add up all these policies, we see that underreporting inflation by just 1% can save the government **between $500 billion and $1 trillion a year**. This is 30% of the entire tax revenue of the US government. Underreporting inflation by 3-4% a year would save the government more money than it brings in from taxes every year.\n\n**Evidence of underreporting**\n\nThere has probably never been a time in history when such a massive moral hazard existed and was not exploited. Is there any evidence that the US government has in fact been understating inflation?\n\n1. Changes to the CPI formula\n\n\"Originally, the CPI was determined by comparing the price of a fixed basket of goods and services spanning two different periods. In this case, the CPI was a cost of goods index (COGI). However, over time, the U.S. Congress embraced the view that the CPI should reflect changes in the cost to maintain a constant standard of living.1\ufeff Consequently, the CPI has evolved into a cost of living index (COLI).\n\nOver the years, the methodology used to calculate the CPI has undergone numerous revisions. According to the\u00a0BLS, the changes removed biases that caused the CPI to overstate the inflation rate. The new methodology takes into account changes in the quality of goods and substitution. Substitution, the change in purchases by consumers in response to price changes, changes the relative weighting of the goods in the basket.\ufeff The overall result tends to be a lower CPI. However, critics view the methodological changes and the switch from a\u00a0COGI\u00a0to a COLI as a purposeful manipulation that allows the\u00a0U.S.\u00a0government to report a lower CPI.\" [\\[5\\]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/consumerpriceindex.asp)\n\nEssentially, the methodology used to calculate the CPI was changed to purposefully reduce the amount of inflation that is reported. When a good is considered to be of \"increased quality,\" its price increase is lowered to reflect this. When the price of one good goes up, its relative weighting in the CPI is reduced and another, lower-priced good is \"substituted\" for it.\n\n2) Rent\n\nIn 2005, the average US rent was $755. In 2019, it was $1,164 [\\[6\\]](https://www.deptofnumbers.com/rent/us/). This is an increase of **54%**, or an average yearly increase of 3.1%. During the same time, the CPI has gone from 191.6 to 252.4 [\\[7\\]](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL), which is only a **31%** increase, or an average yearly increase of 1.9%. If we use rent as the true measure of inflation, CPI has underreported inflation by **1.1%** per year. Keep in mind that, during the period just mentioned, the US experienced the most epic collapse in housing prices it had ever seen, during the 2007-2008 crisis. The housing bubble was already far along by 2005 [\\[8\\]](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CSUSHPISA). Nonetheless, rent increases managed to outstrip the CPI.\n\nWhat do you think? Is the US government massively underreporting inflation?",

This is simply my personal opinion and if you read it, COOL! If not, COOL!\n\nP.S. I dove head first into the stock market for one reason and one reason only, TO MAKE MONEY! And honestly, I haven't done that at all so I know I belong here! But without further ado:\n\nThere are two types of people, 1) people who can effectively analyze the technicals of a stock like GME and 2) liars. There is no way any of you mother effers can account for the volatility of this stock, the amount of holders, the true short interest, and momentum. So take whatever you learned from your little youtube video or on investopedia about your cute Elliott wave theory, fibonacci retracement, and MY FAVORITE \"do you see that cup and handle formation,\" no I don't you idiot, it's like looking at the dam clouds, you can create anything with an imagination! The reason I can say this so confidently is because I was one of the retards that thought I could analyze the stock with my tools only to find out I was wrong every time! I mean I hit some targets, but where there was supposed to be support it fell, where there was supposed to be resistance it broke through, there is no telling where the thing is going (hopefully up). Rather than focusing on the technicals instead I have been paying attention to trends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[I even color coded this bihh for you.

I mean it's pretty simple, price bounces around a certain price then breaks out (up in this case), then corrects (goes down), then repeats. Notice how some of the highs tend to become support where the price consolidates (stays in a specific range). All I know is that I am pretty happy with the price hanging around the $180 - $200 range or even lower because that seems to becoming a nice support level. Who knows what could happen, let's just hope history repeats itself.

        "selftext": "[Source](https://rsch.baml.com/access?q=JLQz8CGIkJs)\n\n**Key takeaways**\n\n* Data suggests that institutional announcements, inflows into GBTC, and miner reward cuts help drive Bitcoin prices\n* The main argument for Bitcoin is not diversification, stable returns, or inflation protection, but sheer price appreciation\n* Bitcoin CO2 emissions are the same as Greece's and rise in line with prices. Our ESG reading is low on E, and mixed on S &amp; G\n\n## Bitcoin supply is artificially scarce, demand drives prices\n\nJust like in other commodities, supply and demand drive Bitcoin prices. But there are twists. Bitcoin output is capped at 21mn coins and supply growth halves every 4 years. It is designed to become increasingly constrained. So demand swings are key to price moves. Indeed, we show major institutional announcements and miner reward cuts have been followed by upward Bitcoin moves. Similarly, flows into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) appear to lead weekly Bitcoin returns. A while ago, we argued a surge in trading liquidity was a key feature of the asset. Yet Bitcoin remains limited by its complex settlement process (crypto mining), and can just handle 14k transactions per hour relative to Visa's stated 236mn.\n\n## No good reason to own BTC unless you see prices going up\n\nBitcoin has also become correlated to risk assets, it is not tied to inflation, and remains exceptionally volatile, making it impractical as a store of wealth or payments mechanism. As such, the main portfolio argument for holding Bitcoin is not diversification, stable returns, or inflation protection, but rather sheer price appreciation, a factor that depends on Bitcoin demand outpacing supply. Unlike other asset classes, our work shows liquidity bursts measured by the Amihud ratio caused positive Bitcoin returns. Average 10y Sharpe ratio for Bitcoin is about 1.3 despite stellar returns, compared to 1 for NDX. Plus Bitcoin returns are sensitive to increased dollar demand. A net inflow into Bitcoin of $93mn may result in a 1% price rise, while the analogue for gold is more than 20 times higher.\n\n## Our Bitcoin ESG read: low on E, mixed on S and G\n\nFew ESG providers factor Bitcoin exposure into ESG ratings. But its Environmental score is poor: the network emits today about 60mn tons of CO2, the same as Greece. Plus a $1bn fresh inflow into Bitcoin may cause CO2 to rise by the equivalent of 1.2mn ICE cars. As hash power today is mostly in coal-fired Xinjiang, a link between prices, energy demand &amp; CO2 means Bitcoin is tied to Chinese coal. Should prices rise to $1mn, Bitcoin may turn into the world's 5th largest emitter, surpassing Japan. On Social &amp;Governance issues, democratization of money and anonymity of ownership can be positive, as it is helpful in territories with corrupt financial systems and lowers costs by eliminating intermediaries. But negatives outweigh. Anonymity aids nefarious activities. Reprisk, an ESG tracker, found 181 companies faced risks linked to Bitcoin around money laundering, corruption, bribery, fraud, and breaches of data privacy.\n\n## CBDCs are kryptonite for crypto, but DeFi is intriguing\n\nA number of central banks (notably, the ECB) are talking about launching retail digital currencies that may use mainstream technology and operate on mainstream payment rails. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are aimed at protecting CBs against private sector stablecoins (such as Diem), as CBs view Bitcoin et al as (spec) assets, not currencies. Also, the growth of decentralized finance (\"DeFi\") shows the strength of Ethereum; its computational ability is vital to DeFi applications. Yet Ethereum has similarESG issues as Bitcoin, even if it may have better tools to tackle them. DeFi is interesting, but small and faces challenges in going mainstream. We think it hasn't a compelling lending proposition at present, and its diversification makes it challenging for the mass market.",

        "selftext": "Something I would never ever do with the stock market is borrow $300,000 from the brokerage and invest it in a single stock. \n\nBuying a property as an investment and not a home seams like an extremely high risk play. The money i could get for rent here would probably only break me even on taxes in my state, let alone the other expenses that go into being a land lord. What I've been told here is that you're looking to levarage the money you borrow from the bank and make money on the appreciation of the property. \n\nWhat if the neighborhood turns to shit?? What if you buy at the peak moments of the sellers market and the value of the home drops drastically. Isn't that leverage going to be equally as bad to the downside? If i put down $100,000 for a $500,000 home and the value drops to $400,000 by years end...

        "selftext": "The U.S. Army said Wednesday that Microsoft has won a contract to build more than custom HoloLens augmented reality headsets. The contract for over 120,000 headsets could be worth up to $21.88 billion over 10 years, a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC.\n\nThe deal shows Microsoft can generate meaningful revenue from a futuristic product resulting from years of research, beyond core areas such as operating systems and productivity software.\n\nIt follows a $480 million contract Microsoft received to give the Army prototypes of the Integrated Visual Augmented System, or IVAS, in 2018. The new deal will involve providing production versions.\n\nThe standard-issue HoloLens, which costs $3,500, enables people to see holograms overlaid over their actual environments and interact using hand and voice gestures. An IVAS prototype that a CNBC reporter tried out in 2019 displayed a map and a compass and had thermal imaging to reveal people in the dark. The system could also show the aim for a weapon.\n\n\"The IVAS headset, based on HoloLens and augmented by Microsoft Azure cloud services, delivers a platform that will keep soldiers safer and make them more effective,\" Alex Kipman, a technical fellow at Microsoft and the person who introduced the HoloLens in 2015, wrote in a blog post. \"The program delivers enhanced situational awareness, enabling information sharing and decision-making in a variety of scenarios.\"\n\nThe headset enables soldiers to fight, rehearse and train in one system, the Army said in a statement. The contract, which was awarded on Friday, has a five-year base period, with a five-year option after that, an Army spokesperson told CNBC an email. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe deal makes Microsoft a more prominent technology supplier to the U.S. military. In 2019, Microsoft secured a contract to provide cloud services to the Defense Department, beating out Amazon, the leader of the public-cloud market. Amazon has been challenging the contract, which could be worth up to $10 billion, in federal court.\n\n[Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/microsoft-wins-contract-to-make-modified-hololens-for-us-army.html)",

Powell talks, there's a 66% chance the market will tank.**\n\nWhen J. Powell talked, my prediction was wrong more often than it was right -- and usually by a lot. On average, my prediction for the daily low was off by 1.37% whenever he spoke.\n\nI wanted to look into that, so I tested out some of the big narratives we heard this month\n\n[Click here to see that research visualized.](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/HORAC)\n\nJ. Powell used to be able to pump the market -- but since 2020, I learned, the market has turned red on 66% of the days that he has either made a speech or a public testimony, with the market closing, on average, down 1.24%.\n\n**The NASDAQ is often a better predictor of a stock's price than the company itself.**\n\nI've seen a lot of posts here lately saying: \"Why is everybody talking about indexes? Isn't this supposed to be a stock forum?\"\n\nOne thing this month affirmed for me is that, if you want to know what AAPL or MSFT are going to do today, you have to look at the market itself first.\n\nAAPL, MSFT, GOOG, and AMZN were all extremely correlated with the NASDAQ this month, to the point that, statistically speaking, it can be said that 81% of the variations in Apple's price this month can be explained by changes in the NASDAQ.\n\nI saw a lot of people in the daily discussion asking: \"Why is AAPL tanking? What new is there?\" But -- unless there actually is company news -- that's often the wrong question to ask. \n\n**The market isn't always affected by what CNBC says...**\n\nOne of the biggest stories we heard this month was about the \"bond yield\". The 10-year bond yield went up today, CNBC would report, and so the NASDAQ was sure to tank.\n\nIt never really made sense to a lot of investors -- so I looked into whether that story held up.\n\nI'll let you draw your own conclusions, but here's what I can say for sure:\n\n* There was no statistically significant correlation between the 10-year bond yield and the NASDAQ's price in March\n* If there were one, it would be a positive correlation. When the bond yield went up, it was more likely that the NASDAQ would go up with it than down.\n* There was more of a correlation on days when the bond yield reached a new 12-month high -- but only if the new yield was heavily reported. If it went unmentioned, the NASDAQ went up.\n* The days when the bond yield did significantly go up and the NASDAQ did significantly go down were all days when J. Powell gave a speech\n\n**... but sometimes it is.**\n\nThat doesn't mean everything CNBC said was a lie this year.\n\nAnother huge story this month was the rotation out of tech into value stocks -- and then, at the end of the month, the rotation back.\n\nThis story *totally* holds up. If you plot a tech stock like AAPL's price against JP Morgan's (which I've done for you [here](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/HORAC)), you'll see that, 61% of the time, these stocks went in the exact opposite direction.\n\nPeople really were rotating out of tech and into value -- and they really are starting to come back.\n\n**I still think the stock market can be predicted**\n\nWhen I started doing this, I got a lot of hate from people who said that only an idiot would try to predict the market. But after a while, those hate messages stopped -- and, instead, people started sending me hate messages saying that they could predict the market better than I can.\n\nThey probably can. I didn't do as well as I'd like this month, but, when I was right, I knew *why* I was right. And when I was wrong, I knew *why* I was wrong -- and had a pretty good idea of how to do better next time.\n\nEverything is *not* priced-in, I've learned this month. Take Biden's speech last night. The market didn't even budge while he was talking. Sure, we were in afterhours, but even Robinhood users were allowed to invest -- and his plan had been laid out weeks in advance. But the Wall Street traders were off work, so the market didn't budge until the morning -- when it absolutely mooned.\n\nIf you pay close enough attention, you *can* get ahead of Wall Street. I'm increasingly convinced of that, and I believe that my predictions will get better as time goes on.\n\n[You can see today's prediction here.](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/kHRAC)",

        "selftext": "**Preamble:** One of the main questions that I had and I see recurring on this sub is how to identify and invest in emerging stocks before it becomes mainstream news. I did not have the time to actively track social media and decided to build a program that does it for me.\n\n**How it works:** The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).\n\nHere is the stock picked by the program and my DD\n\n**Stock:**   **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ($TSM)**\n\nWeek on Week increase in mentions: **130%**\n\nMonth on Month increase in mentions: **324%**\n\nAverage sentiment across mentions: **+29.5%**\n\n**DD**\n\n**Core Product**\n\nTSMC was founded in 1987 by Morris Chang, who previously had worked in Texas Instruments. TSMC can be considered as possibly the most important company in the world that few people have heard of. This is because it is practically a chokepoint of the $470 Billion semiconductor industry and is instrumental in supplying chips to almost all the major players. Currently, the company supplies to Apple for their A14 chips and ARM-based chips for their Mac products, Qualcomm, MediaTek, AMD, Intel, and Nvidia.\n\nThe company is the world\u2019s largest semiconductor foundry. They are in the pure-play foundry business. This means that they do not produce any processors for their own products but they manufacture and sell chips to companies such as AMD, Intel, and Apple. The main reason for which companies such as Apple and AMD source chips from TSMC is that they do not have to build their own expensive silicon fabrication plants (the CapEx of the plans run into 10s of billions of dollars and it takes an extremely long time to set up) to manufacture their chips. TSMC is currently the world\u2019s 11th largest company by market capitalization ($554 B).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[TSMC absolutely dominates the advanced chip market ](https://preview.redd.it/qx1btw29krq61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61ce94bf883480c99f5e74a43bdea79bbf9d4d9f)\n\nAs you can see from the above chart, TSMC absolutely dominates the advanced chip market (&lt;10nm, think phone processors) which also has the highest margins. The company effectively controls more than half (54% to be exact) of the world\u2019s made-to-order chip market.\n\n**Financials**\n\nTSMC posted its best-ever quarter in Q4\u201920 with revenues jumping 22% to a record $12.68 Billion and profits increasing 23% to $5.1 Billion. They are also expected to invest heavily this year with capital expenditure for production and development of advanced chips to be between $25-$28 Billion. (60% higher than the amount TSMC spend in 2020)\n\nThey also have a very strong financial position with $23 Billion in cash vs a long-term liability of only $10 billion (YE 2020). The company has also predicted a record first-quarter revenue between $12.7 Billion and $13 Billion, which is almost a 30% growth from the same period last year. We do have to note that their share price has jumped more than 140% over the past 12 months giving it the current valuation of $554 Billion.\n\n**Potential and Hype Factors**\n\n**Technology moat:** Compared to peers, TSMC is easily the leader in chip production technology. The company has delivered over 1 Billion 7nm chips by 2020 whereas Intel is still trying to master its 7nm development process. For those who are unaware of chip manufacturing, in general, the smaller the node size (measured in nanometer (nm)), the better the performance and power management. This is why the companies making the top-end chips want the smallest node size available.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w6mw9ehakrq61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a70944796b31b7b971e743f497854c29d9b797d1\n\nTSMC is currently in the process of producing 5nm chips (20% of their total wafer revenue) and is already ramping up for 3nm production by the end of 2022. It takes a long time to spin up a new silicon fabrication factory (3-4 years is the average time it takes for a factory to go from planning to production).\n\nThis leadership in technology would be one of the key drivers for growth in the coming years. The $28 Billion Capex spending also reflects on the management\u2019s confidence about the long-term demand for the advanced chips.\n\n**Strong long-term demand:** Even though the current shortage faced by automakers is mainly due to a supply chain issue, cars, in general, are getting more and more complicated and EV\u2019s tend to need better hardware and chips. This will force the automakers to rush to lock in future supply. Even though the margins produced from the auto-chips are not as high as the phones/laptops, the producers of the chips are definitely going to benefit in the long run.\n\n**Risk and Competition**\n\nThere are multiple risks associated with TSMC. First and foremost, at the current valuation, the stock is definitely not cheap. The current PE ratio is 33 which puts them in the same bucket as Apple and AMD. While this might be representative of their future growth potential, it is on the higher side for a manufacturing company.\n\nThe company might face a short-term crisis in production as Taiwan is currently facing its most severe water shortage in 56 years. Taiwan\u2019s chipmakers have begun stocking up on truckloads of water to prepare for shortages. During a similar drought in 2015, Taiwan was forced to implement water restrictions for industrial companies. This can cause a significant impact on the top and bottom line as TSMC is currently producing at 100% capacity. A weakening USD can also have a significant impact on TSMC\u2019s EPS as \\~99% of their sales are in US dollars whereas only 15% of its COGS is in US dollars.\n\nA long-term risk for TSMC is that their increasingly dominant position in chip manufacturing is starting to attract political attention. The current shock from the auto chip shortage is forcing governments to bring vital supply chains back into their countries in order to make them less vulnerable to disruption. In the US, lawmakers are citing the chip shortage as proof that the country needs to revive more semiconductor manufacturing at home. This has forced TSMC to build a $12 billion plant in Arizona. This political climate can be beneficial for Intel, given their current foray into fabrication. (I do not think Intel can effectively compete with TSMC in fabrication without significant help in trade restrictions. As we can see from the process roadmap, Intel is currently years behind TSMC in the manufacturing process and they could not make their products work even when they had the best process technology years back)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nTSMC is currently one of the world\u2019s largest companies and they are definitely not resting on their laurels. They have been continuously working on building more capacity and advancing their nodes. Even though there are some short-term and long-term risks in terms of their exposure to the US dollar, rising geopolitical tensions, etc., I believe TSMC\u2019s current technological moat, a monopoly level market share in advanced chips, and the rising use of smartphones and IoT devices put TSMC in a very strong position over the long term!\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.

If the option contract is not exercised, OCC validates a release of the pledged securities, which are then returned to the Participant's general free account.*\n\n***\\*\\*\\* Release of Deposits with Options Clearing Corporation on Expired Options****OCC automatically releases securities deposited with it to cover margin requirements on an option contract when the option contract expires.

The electric vehicle pioneer posted a healthy quarterly increase in deliveries, a number more than double 2020's first-quarter total.\n\nInvestors had been wary of the figures -- not because of demand or competition, but because of the global automotive chip shortage. Their worries turned out to be overblown.\n\nTesla delivered about 185,000 vehicles in the first quarter, compared with 181,000 in the fourth-quarter of 2020 and about 88,000 vehicles in the first quarter of 2020. Year-over-year growth is more than 100%.\n\nWall Street estimates ranged from roughly 162,000 to about 172,000. Estimates had fallen from more than 180,000 deliveries, mainly because of the chip shortage.\n\nTesla didn't mention the chip shortage in its report. It did point out, however, that the Model Y has been received in China. The company began manufacturing the Y in China a few months ago. .\n\nThe result keeps Tesla on track to deliver the Wall Street consensus of roughly 800,000 vehicles in 2021, up about 60% year over year.

        "selftext": "I've done 3 DD posts and have not been wrong yet, check my post history. Up next is $ASO and so far it's shaping up to be a great trade.   \n\n\nThere are a couple of key items regarding $ASO to understand why it's primed for a big breakout.  \n\n\n1. They just reported earnings this week, and the results were stellar:\n   1. Revenues were US$5.7b, approximately in line with what analysts expected.\n   2. (EPS) crushed expectations, coming in at US$3.79, an impressive 41% ahead of estimates. \n2. It has high institutional ownership (I've seen conflicting numbers, if I am to go off of yahoo data it would appear that 60mm of the 90mm shares are institutionally owned. )\n3. March 15, 2021 short interest was over 39%\n\nApril 16, 2021 options:\n\n* The $25, $30, $35 all have more open interest than any single strike in the put column. \n* 18,973 for the $30 strike is massive volume for a stock that has 93% institutional ownership. \n   * The public float is 31 million\n   * Outstanding shares are 90 million\n* The 18,000 contracts on the $30 strike representing nearly 2 million shares is pretty significant when considering the public float is only 31 million. If every strike closes ITM this will likely have somewhere in the 40,000 - 50,000 contracts closing ITM which is 4-5mm of that 31mm shares (7%)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l5tm54103nq61.png?width=2268&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3c72475aad10bed9f146c80db683c904e74b1bf\n\n$ASO closed the day just over $29 / share and has moved up a little in after hours, nearly 30. We have a long weekend so once Monday rolls around there will be a lot of pressure on MM's due to the fact that 18,000+ contracts would expire ITM at the $30 strike by that Friday. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1j8770hh4nq61.png?width=1938&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d6dff7982ba7b12ec4bf9476c85f1e76121bb52\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions:  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ynwsth0s4nq61.png?width=1566&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d34abbfed3a55a20e98c814a6e46fbb78b384b2",

        "selftext": "This is going to be long - I have a lot to say, but you might as well read it otherwise you ape-fingered stock lovers will have to use those hairy appendages to crack open a real book and I think we all know nobody wants to do that. This is not strictly a financial analysis, this is an explanation of the psychedelic therapy industry. Any good book gives you the 5 Ws and an H so that will be the form of this post. Thank you in advance for reading, I hope people can gain some understandings from this and see the potential importance of these therapies. Again, to be clear, the industry will focus on the development of therapies from more than just psilocybin (LSD, MDMA, Ibogaine, DMT, Ketamine etc.) and it is not a recreational market.\n\n**This is not investment advice...I just like getting high.** \n\n(To be up front: I work as a researcher for a psychedelic therapy organization and I have a position in some of these companies - I won't name them as I got banned before for naming as most are under $1bn market cap - I will mention a few but I am not suggesting to invest in them, just hoping to provide some insight here)\n\n**What is psilocybin/psychedelic therapy?**\n\nIt is important to understand what drugs/pharmaceuticals do...simply put they are a stimulus that elicits a response and alters the normal functioning of your brain, although your brain is likely not functioning \"normally\" if you are needing pharmaceuticals - all the technical aspects are unnecessary if you understand that (unless you want to know which drug will be most effective and why). Psilocybin therapy will look like molecular derivatives from the original psilocybe mushroom and its main compound (psilocybin) - this is necessary for the development of a pharmaceutical industry, otherwise Advil wouldn't be a successful drug (we need branding and ownership by way of patents).\n\nOur brain is a machine, finely tuned based on genetics and experience throughout life - this is how alcoholism can be inherited and also generated through substance use, many of these machines are not operating correctly and thus need some input to try and get it back to proper functionality (in dumb guy terms, when your big TV doesn't work and you smack it to make it run - the TV is your brain and the drug is the smack). It's all about serotonin baby - psilocybin specifically acts on our serotonergic receptors, it has an affinity for it, it also causes a cortical desynchronization amongst functionally connected regions - if you're fucked up, you probably have some bad connections up in that dome so psilocybin specializes in throwing off those connections and allowing new ones to form. This is why it works best in tandem with therapy...in the psychedelic state, many more states are possible and connections can form more freely, essentially allowing you to build a new bridge - whether you cross it or not is why the therapy helps (typical talk therapy, CBT, cognitive remediation and meditative practice are good options). The key to the success of this industry (and the therapy) is from turning this **state** into a **trait**.\n\n**Why is it effective?**\n\nPsilocybin specifically acts on a variety of brain regions that are key to everything from general cognition, self-understanding/referential thinking and our attentional networks (what you pay attention to is what you think). This therapy is very promising because of its ability to treat co-morbid disorders - if you are an alcoholic you are probably also depressed or anxious, usually you'd have to do some program for the alcoholism, or other addiction and maybe take a drug to counteract the physical effects of not having the substance, but you'd also need another drug for the depression - psilocybin is a one stop shop of sorts. It has been proven highly effective for improving addiction as well as the co-morbid disorders alongside that. Same goes for obesity, you're sort of addicted to food in some ways (although it isn't that simple, it is somewhat similar) and you're depressed because you look bad, you're anxious about disease as well due to your poor health...again multiple treatments needed to help one person. You can't just take a handful of mushrooms and suddenly your PTSD will disappear, that would simply just produce a state. We need to transform this state (or the operation of your brain at that time) into a trait (how your brain will typically operate). Because these disorders/diseases disrupt the functioning of your brain, you need something to alter it - namely a pharmaceutical, what the drug industry won't tell you is that everything alters your brain, something such as going on a walk, hanging out with a friend, listening to music or looking at art - all change your brain, but some brains are severely dysfunctional which is why drugs are needed (but they aren't the only thing needed). It is also important to understand that typical anti-depressant pharmaceuticals have a delayed action - which is good for making money but bad for treatment purposes (whereas something like ketamine therapy or psilocybin therapy do not have that same delay). \n\n**TLDR;** High level - psilocybin creates an overall cortical desynchronization that allows the brain to operate in a way it wouldn't normally, and leads to a potential shifting of functioning/connectivity between regions.\n\n**Who does it help?**\n\nResearch is still young, as there was a large break in its study due to its legislative classification, but we know it is most effective for substance use disorders, obesity, acute stress disorder, PTSD, anxiety, treatment-resistant depression and more (with other potential uses to be discovered for the other substances). There are many companies that have different focuses (or business models) which is important for considering your investment - some focus on orphan diseases, obesity, Compass Pathways (this is over $1bn market cap so I can mention it) - treatment-resistant depression...go search it out yourself, but the most likely first use of this therapy will be for depression. There is also the potential for mental health issues that are not on the level of a disorder - you may be sad sometimes, or anxious others but it is not a consistent aspect of your existence. This scenario looks like a microdose (LET ME BE CLEAR - **zero point zero** research has been done on the effectiveness of microdosing, technically it isn't even a word as I get red squiggly's under it as I write, but if it is proven to have some effect you will see people taking these in a similar vein of Adderall or CBD pills with vitamin D - another potential market of psychedelics). The reason some doubt the effectiveness of a microdose is that it does not produce a psychedelic state (which is where the proverbial magic happens with psilocybin therapy), but if it has similar effects on similar brain pathways, a microdose could be a possible therapy and some do swear by it today - but again, there is **NO research** on the topic **YET** (another exciting potential for market growth however).\n\n**TLDR;** most people you lazy shit, this paragraph isn't that long just read it.\n\n**Where is the money?**\n\nTHIS IS NOT A RECREATIONAL MARKET.\n\nOk so as everyone knows, or should be aware of, the world is fucked - mental health issues are on the rise each year and it only continued to grow with the pandemic. For some quick maths we can add up the \"value\" or \"cost\" of the various disorders that psychedelics can treat (again more treatment uses will be available with further R&amp;D). I'm just going to do a few to give you an example of the scale of this treatment, which is likely (although I'll be honest not proven) a more effective treatment.\n\nMental health disorders will cost the global economy $16 trillion (USD) by 2030. ([https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/mental-illness-will-cost-world-16-usd-trillion-2030](https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/mental-illness-will-cost-world-16-usd-trillion-2030))\n\nThe total cost in the US alone of major depressive disorder (MDD) is estimated at $210 billion annually - this is not how much the treatment of the disorder is \"worth\" but rather how much it \"costs\" based on absenteeism (missing work) and presenteeism (lack of productivity at work) - caveat, I do wonder how exactly they calculate these so I don't swear by these numbers but it is a good estimate. (Businesses spend money not to lose money - keep that in mind)\n\n([http://www.workplacementalhealth.org/Mental-Health-Topics/Depression/Quantifying-the-Cost-of-Depression](http://www.workplacementalhealth.org/Mental-Health-Topics/Depression/Quantifying-the-Cost-of-Depression))\n\nDepression and anxiety cost the global economy $1 trillion (USD) annually due to lost productivity - important to recall that psilocybin itself can treat up to 5 disorders that we know of right now and the other psychedelics which are also part of the market will treat others in addition.\n\n([https://www.who.int/teams/mental-health-and-substance-use/mental-health-in-the-workplace](https://www.who.int/teams/mental-health-and-substance-use/mental-health-in-the-workplace))\n\nGlobal antidepressants market is expected to grow from $14.3 billion in 2019 to about $28.6 billion in 2020 and given the increased rates you can assume this number will continue to grow - this is only depression people, not all the other disorders/disease treatable by psychedelics.\n\n([http://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/04/21/2019282/0/en/Global-Antidepressants-Market-2020-to-2030-COVID-19-Implications-and-Growth.html](http://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/04/21/2019282/0/en/Global-Antidepressants-Market-2020-to-2030-COVID-19-Implications-and-Growth.html))\n\nOver the next 8 years (I believe this started in 2014) the US will have spent $4.2 trillion on treating obesity-related disease (remember that almost 40% of men and women in the US are considered obese), Germany will spend $390 billion, Brazil $251 billion and the UK $237 billion if nothing is done to try to prevent it (and not much has been).\n\n([https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/10/treating-obesity-related-illness-will-cost-12tn-a-year-from-2025-experts-warn](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/10/treating-obesity-related-illness-will-cost-12tn-a-year-from-2025-experts-warn))\n\nOk so as I am attempting to show here, a metric butt-ton is spent on various disorders/diseases that psilocybin could treat more effectively, and there is an even greater economic cost globally due to how these disorders/diseases impact productivity and availability (the best ability is availability baby). I said in my previous post that this could potentially (not this year, not in 5 years, but sometime in the future that I don't know) be a $200 billion industry and I believe that is a low estimate in all fairness. Seems insane, but I think the numbers show the severe cost of mental health disorders/diseases and the extremely high revenue of pharmaceutical companies off of these disorders. I am not going to make another estimate - I just gave some numbers which you can add up (and there are more numbers to be considered as I didn't mention all potential treatments) to devise the potential market and the costs associated with it. Again, people will spend money to not lose as much money. According to the WHO, every $1 spent on scaling up treatment will have a return of $4 in productivity - using my calculator, spending $4 trillion will reduce the global economic burden of mental health disorders. I must reiterate, there are many other drugs/compounds under investigation that fall under the category of psychedelics and those too will be used to help relieve this burden and acquire revenue.\n\nThere will be money in the education behind this market - teaching medical students about its use, practitioners will need training etc...a variety of markets behind this as well.\n\n**TLDR;** Pathway to profitability - regulatory approval, clinics opened up for the specific purpose of psilocybin therapy, molecular derivative creation...testing...and patenting - leading to the creation of new pharmaceuticals to be sold to reduce the growing epidemic of mental health disorders and their extreme cost on the global economy.\n\n**BUT THERE COULD BE A RECREATIONAL MARKET.**\n\nMicrodosing is another potential market for psilocybin specifically, which could open up another revenue stream - research is pending and studies are on the way but not yet. Just important to understand that there is potential market expansion with the lower doses vs. the higher therapeutic doses.\n\n**How will the industry grow?**\n\nSadly, the industry will grow as mental health issues and global health issues do. As long as these kids keep tik-toking there will be a whole new generation of anxious, depressed and stressed people that need help. The cannabis industry needed legalization as the money will come from the recreational market - much like alcohol, they need it to be widely available to everyone (legalization is an arduous process), that is just a bonus for the psychedelic sector. This is a misunderstanding of the highest level to compare psychedelics to the cannabis industry, but I still anticipate people doing that in the comments, oh well...you can't fix stupid - but maybe psychedelics can! There is no need for legalization, it is all about the approval of health regulators - which is going well as the FDA last October granted breakthrough therapy designation to psilocybin for the treatment of depression...all is going in the right direction now.\n\nThe industry will continue to grow (catalysts) with more research, funding and education (all 3 going hand in hand...the more research, the better the results, the more funding and the more education). There are still many other substances that have not been studied to great lengths and will likely prove to be effective as treatments for other disorders/diseases, yet again expanding the psychedelic therapy market (MDMA is already in late stage trials for the treatment of PTSD for example).\n\n**TLDR;** research, funding and education (of all the substances associated with the psychedelic therapy industry)\n\n**When will this occur?** (last one keep going, jesus this is long and I'm transcribing from a Word doc)\n\nBreakthrough therapy designation by the FDA is massive, similar approvals should continue as more trials/studies are completed. This is the toughest aspect to nail down - I can tell you that given the increased incidence rate of mental health disorders and diseases globally it will be sooner rather than later for psilocybin (and MDMA), the others will be later.\n\nTimeline for **1)** making money and **2)** getting this therapy available to the public:\n\n**1)** Months ago you could have made money on a lot of these companies, so the sooner you get in the better (given the correct selection of organizations, you can do that research yourself but I will say MindMed (again over $1bn market cap) is not going to be a leader in the industry the way they are going, but you can still make money on them in the meantime). It is important to remember, not everyone in the industry now will be in it for the long run.\n\n**2)** This is for global use, not just an American organization or a Western therapy...it is going to be used globally (I mean other than in China unless they go for some mind control type experiments a la the CIA with LSD) by most first-world countries that can afford the R&amp;D and regulation - sorry my Russian comrades I don't think you count as first-world, but the others are and will be getting in on this.\n\nNow, **this is not an investment strategy or advice.** This has been a breakdown of the industry and its potential. How you play this market is up to you - maybe someone can devise a strategy and share with the others. It is **extremely important** to understand that the inevitability of further capital raising will impact the share price due to potential dilution. That is my one word of caution that has no bearing on the actual performance or potential of the industry, but it does impact your ability to maximize the bag - ensure you have a proper entry and exit strategy to avoid getting burned because there will be further capital raising.\n\nBest of luck - if you enjoyed this and somehow made it, throw an upvote on this bitch, this is my first in depth (and probably last) post so I hope that I have made some sense, shed some light and encouraged you about the potential of these therapies. If you think I'm an idiot or a hippie let me know in the comments and as I said before...I just like getting high.\n\nPEACE.",

        "selftext": "**Lumber Sector**\n\nFirst of all the lumber sector is booming right now so the lumber companies have been doing very well because of it. Right now lumber prices are skyrocketing as we are seeing lumber futures above $1000 once again making new all time highs. Lumber is in high demand as covid has caused a lot of these companies to not be operating at their maximum so there is a shortage on supply. A lot of these companies stock prices have surpassed their 2018 highs while others are nearing it. A big reason why lumber stocks peaked in 2018 and have decreased since is because of the new laws and regulations that have caused higher tariffs on their revenue, sales, etc. In 2020 the new stay at home lifestyle has caused people to take on new projects such as building a new deck for their backyard, or renovating their house as a whole. Canada has seen a huge housing market boom because of the shortage of supplies and people have been upgrading their houses to put in on the market and make a profit. Not to mention the increased immigration once Covid settles down which will spark a increase in building of new homes. Lumber prices won't be going down anytime soon and I believe it'll maintain these prices for 2021.\n\n**Lumber Stocks**\n\nRight now I see a company that is severely undervalued when compared to its competitors and that is Canfor Corporation, $CFP on the tsx. \\*Note all numbers are expressed as millions of dollars\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Canfor 2020 Financial Reports Summarized ](https://preview.redd.it/6srhobyp4tq61.png?width=551&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae213b4863e40a8862e4100903e2bd5ca32f8624)\n\nAs you can see their revenue and shareholders equity have been increasing quarter over quarter at a nice rate. Their price per book is looking good and their market cap in comparison to their quarterly revenue is also extremely good. Now let's compare it with Stella-Jones, $SJ and West Fraser Timber, $WFG.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Stella-Jones 2020 Financial Reports Summarized](https://preview.redd.it/cvqtqd2c5tq61.png?width=549&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92d04d8e989b0ccf8d14dce25e463b1ad974f898)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[West Fraser 2020 Financial Reports Summarized](https://preview.redd.it/2ltf63mg5tq61.png?width=550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5c0b055b146d2e79485e369259e082345fae6a9)\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThere are some key differences that we should make note of:\n\n\\- SJ and WFG both are trading at much higher price/book than Canfor.\n\n\\- Canfor is posting much higher revenue than Stella Jones (nearly doubled) yet is trading at nearly the same market cap.\n\n\\- Canfor and West Fraser have nearly identical revenues and net income yet West Fraser is trading at an 11 billion market cap while Canfor is trading at a 3 billion market cap.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn all honestly you could buy just about any 3 of these companies and you'll make a decent ROI in 2021. However, Canfor appears to be the most undervalued amongst its peers and offers the highest value. This isn't financial advice as what has said is just my mere opinion on the matter. I don't have a position in any of the mentioned companies but I am looking to take a position after the long weekend. Remember to do your own research and due diligence where necessary.",

I don't believe in this company, as they just diluted investor funds, and are a pretty shit company with terrible financials, heres how you can make money off them anyway.\n\nSNDL trades around $1.10 right now, after being beat down. I've been making solid money selling OTM 2$ and 1.50$ calls, so even at an entry point of 300 shares@ 1.40, i've still made money.\n\nHeres the cheatcode i've found. At 1.10$, you can buy 100 shares for 110$, and then turn around and sell 1$ calls 2 weeks out for a premium of .20-.25, for a profit of 10-15$ for every 110$ in risk (only if stock falls to 0). If the price drops below 1$, you've pocketed the premium for free, and can continue to sell 1$ calls for profit at very low risk. \n\nOnly way it can go tits up is for the stock to drop well below 1$ a share, and even then with enough time you can sell enough contracts to still make profit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Buy SNDL, and sell covered calls for biweekly income with very low risk.

        "selftext": "Janet Yellen will use her first major address as Treasury secretary to argue for a global minimum corporate tax rate, Axios has learned, as she makes the case for President Biden\u2019s plan to raise U.S. corporate taxes to fund his $2 trillion+ infrastructure plan.\n\nWhy it matters: Convincing other countries to impose a global minimum tax would reduce the likelihood of companies relocating offshore, as Biden seeks to increase the corporate rate from 21% to 28%.\n\n\u201cCompetitiveness is about more than how U.S.-headquartered companies fare against other companies in global merger and acquisition bids,\u201d Yellen will say today in a speech to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, according to an excerpt of her prepared remarks obtained by Axios.\n\"It is about making sure that governments have stable tax systems that raise sufficient revenue to invest in essential public goods and respond to crises, and that all citizens fairly share the burden of financing government.\"\n\"We are working with G20 nations to agree to a global minimum corporate tax rate that can stop the race to the bottom.\"\nThe big picture: President Trump lowered the U.S. rate from 35% to 21%, arguing that U.S. companies were at a global disadvantage and were being incentivized to relocate offshore.\n\nThe average corporate rate in the G7 is 24%, with some nine countries recently lowering their corporate rate, according to the Tax Foundation, a conservative tax group.\nBiden\u2019s plan would also raise the international minimum rate for foreign profits from U.S. companies from 10.5% to 21%, which would still be lower than the 28% domestic corporate rate.\nDriving the news: Biden has tapped five Cabinet secretaries to explain \u2014 and sell \u2014 his plan to the American public, including Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge, Labor Secretary Marty Walsh and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.\n\nYellen\u2019s task is to make the international case. Her speech also is designed to set the tone for the annual spring International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings in Washington, which will begin virtually this week.\nBetween the lines: Biden has been relying on Yellen to convince the business community and reassure Wall Street that his $2 trillion+ infrastructure proposal, on top of his $1.9 trillion stimulus package, won\u2019t lead to inflation.\n\nNow he\u2019s deploying her to convince international finance ministers and central bankers that the world\u2019s biggest economies need to act in concert on corporate rates to avoid a race to the bottom.\nGo deeper: Yellen will also challenge the world\u2019s economic powers to focus on climate change and on ways to improve vaccine access for the world\u2019s poorest countries.\n\nShe will call for $650 billion in new \u201cSpecial Drawing Rights\u201d \u2014 essentially lines of credit at the IMF that can help developing countries access more U.S. dollars.\nThe Trump administration was skeptical of new SDR allocations and many congressional Republicans are still opposed.\nThe bottom line: By trying to convince other countries to impose a global minimum tax, Yellen is acknowledging the risks to the American economy if it acts alone in raising corporate rates.\n\n\u201cTogether we can use a global minimum tax to make sure the global economy thrives based on a more level playing field in the taxation of multinational corporations, and spurs innovation, growth, and prosperity,\u201d she will say.\n\nSource  : https://www.axios.com/janet-yellen-global-minimum-tax-rate-51c7395b-e46a-4a5c-b18b-bdcf5d8bd352.html",

        "selftext": "**BLACKROCKAGEDDON**\n\nUp too late last week, I found this odd-sounding article titled [Clean Energy ETF May See Big](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/clean-energy-etf-may-see-030000958.html) Overhaul What it meant was so amazing I could not believe it:\n\n&gt;In the latest consultation, SPDJI is now planning to increase [their holdings] minimum to 100, more than tripling the current number of companies featured in the index. This will have a major impact on the exposure of the world\u2019s largest clean energy ETFs, the $7bn iShares Global Clean Energy UCITS ETF (INRG) and the $7bn iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN).    \n\nYou\u2019re probably thinking \u201c...oh...um...okay. Whatever?\u201d  Well, let me break this Greek down.  **These BlackRock ETFs (INRG and ICLN) track the S&amp;P Clean Energy Index, and because the index hasn\u2019t been updated in 14 years, it only has 30 holdings.  The new rule proposal means that ICLN/INRG (the BlackRock ETFs) will be required to expand from 30 tickers...to 100...right now.**\n\nSo, BlackRock currently owns WAY too disproportionate a weight in a small basket of stocks that got pumped during the Biden boom post-election (see: PLUG).  **The BlackRock ETFs currently have a stake of 8% or more of EACH of almost a quarter of the stocks in the Index.**  This rebalance means that on a massive scale and in a specified time frame, *ICLN and INRG are compelled to sell and buy hundreds of millions of dollars worth of stake in EACH of the companies already in the index it follows, AND they would PURCHASE initiating stakes in up to 67 other companies.*\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/NwenIEq.jpg\n-ICLN TOP TEN HOLDINGS. SO. MUCH. PLUG.\n\n[I found a document from SPDJI called a \u201cconsultation\u201d that lays out the process.](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/indexnews/announcements/20210324-1345159/1345159_spglobalcleanenergyconsultationexpscorecountweightingresults3-24-2021.pdf). The next morning I e-mailed SPDJI representatives to confirm, and they replied with key information. \n\n[My email chat with SPDJI confirming dates and processes](https://i.imgur.com/xMrOMxR.jpg)\n\nSo, there it is.  **On the 19th of April, according to the criteria listed, 67 new companies are being added to the S&amp;P Clean Energy Index**\u2014the underlyings of which are to be purchased in large quantities by the BlackRock ETFs.  **As 42 Dugg once rapped...IT GET DEEPER.**\n\n****\n\n**Investment Firm Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale released a memo to their clients breaking down the financial implications for current ICLN and INRG holdings\u2014what BlackRock\u2019s gotta buy, and what they gotta sell.** As of this writing they have not answered my calls--apparently the SpotRambo name does not carry much international clout--but [this FT Article had some info on winners and losers currently in the ETF:](https://www.ft.com/content/d43ec8c5-0990-4781-b71f-82cb73a09610)\n\n&gt;This would mean the iShares ETFs (BlackRock) would need to pump more than $400m into each of Vestas Wind Systems, Orsted and NextEra Energy, as well as large sums into Chinese groups such as China Longyuan Power, Xinjiang Goldwind and GCL-Poly Energy.\n\n&gt;This buying spree would be counterbalanced by a wave of disposals. The ETFs would need to sell $405m worth of stock in New Zealand\u2019s Meridian Energy, SocGen estimated, equivalent to 47.6 days of typical turnover.\n\n&gt;For the US-listed American depositary receipts of Brazil\u2019s Companhia Energetica de Minas Gerais, the implied selling of $248m of stock would represent 57.7 per cent of the free-float market capitalisation, SocGen said.\n\nWhoa!  This is a lot of critical information. **Recap:**\n\n**What we know**: On **4/19**, The S&amp;P Clean Energy Index is undergoing a massive overhaul and adding 67 fresh stonks.  BlackRock ETFS ICLN and INRG track this index, and will therefore participate in a frenzy of buying and selling on/before/around that date. **On 4/2 the pro-formas are released indicating the weighting and therefore candidates**. \n\n**What else we know**: New purchases and redistributions--LITERAL pumps and dumps--are a requirement for the BlackRock ETFs.  **According to SocGen, this includes among others: $400m pump for NEE, and extreme dumps for CEG and others.**  Pumps and dumps so large that they represent 40-50 days of the stocks natural trading cycle.\n\n**What we\u2019re pretty damn sure of**: My mans G has been helping me out with some digging.  We are pretty damn sure **PLUG** will go down HARD  once BlackRock divests to spread the wealth.  NEE is a guaranteed add and companies like **BLNK**. We are also looking at **VST** as an addition to the index based on call flow and fundamentals. \n\n**What we\u2019ll do**: Next week we\u2019ll give some winners and losers.  I **will keep calling SocGen (sometimes with fake accents to be more convincing), trying to get the report.**  For now, we are looking for clean-energy infrastructure excitement to provide a run on these stocks this week, making it even more juicy to grab some quick shorties. \n\n****\n\n**ELI5**/**TLDR**: **BlackRock ETFs ICLN and INRG have to buy and sell a bunch of stocks** due to the indexes those ETFs track undergoing a massive overhaul.  It will cause major volatility, produce some big winners, and some even bigger losers. Next week I\u2019ll have more picks.",

It seems that is has it support over here. Last two months PLTR has come down from its ATH, but seems to consolidate at around 23$ at the moment. Also important to note, that this week were red days for a lot of tech stocks, while PLTR ended in the green. Meaning was strong on those days. Now there are multiple news articles circling around.

When it starts running its running fast and quick. Now, during this weekend PLTR has two new catalysts. Hopefully it will bring some power back to this unapreciated big peace maker in the world. \n\nAs I have seen a lot of Cathy Wood lovers in this sub, guess what, Cathy Woods ARK ETF bought around 780.000 shares of PLTR on March 26th 2021. PLTR has to receive more mainstream attention as it deserves. \n\nThis weekend there was also a big leak of around 550 million personal information from FB. FB has to do everything in its power to get back their trust. This is just speculative, and are just my thoughts, but wouldn't it be nice if PLTR would help Mark Zuckerberg?? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRead this post, but remember I am not a financial advisor.

        "selftext": "I would recommend everyone here take a few minutes to look into ReconAfrica (OTC: RECAF). I posted about them to this sub a few months ago just before they were spudding their first well, but we were in peak renewable energy hype at the time, and few people were looking to get into oil exploration plays.\n\n**So who are they?** \n\nReconnaissance Energy Africa (ReconAfrica) is a junior exploration company that has the exclusive rights to a newly discovered 30,000 ft deep sedimentary basin that lies beneath the Kalahari desert in Namibia. That Kavango sedimentary basin comprises *6.3 million acres* in Botswana and 2.45 million acres in neighboring Botswana. It\u2019s virtually unheard of for a small exploration company to hold the rights to such a large basin. \n\nWhy has the Kavango basin been missed for so long and how was it discovered now? You can listen to a video interview with the founder [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1T7QwOnSQ), but it\u2019s mainly it\u2019s due to historical reasons and the fact that the Kavango basin is hidden underneath the Kalahari desert.\n\n**How much oil is there?**\n\nEstimated reserves will not be known until the basin is fully proven and explored, but geologists are estimating the Kavango may contain **tens of billions to hundreds of billions of barrels of oil** (as much as the entire Permian basin in Texas). See the [Jarvie report](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/ReconAfrica-Postulated-Petroleum-Yields-V2.pdf) if you\u2019re interested in taking a closer look at the numbers.\n\nBill Cathey, founder of Earthfield Technology, and one of the world\u2019s leading geophysicists whose been in the business for 30+ years has said \u201cNowhere in the world is there a sedimentary basin this deep that does not produce commercial hydrocarbons.\u201d So even in the worst case, it is still very likely Recon is sitting on significant oil reserves. But in the best case, if the Kavango lives up to predictions we could be seeing an upside of more than 100x.\n\n**What\u2019s the timeline?**\n\nReconAfrica has planned for an initial 3-well exploratory program before beginning JV/farmout discussions. They are nearing total depth for the first well (we should be seeing a PR about that coming soon) and will soon be moving onto their second well. Once the core samples from these wells are analyzed, and if they yield good news you can expect the stock to jump quite a bit. And if oil is hit, you'll be in for some crazy gains.\n\n**How does this compare to 88 Energy?**\n\nI\u2019ve got a small bag of EEENF but personally, I\u2019m more bullish on RECAF because the upside potential really is staggering. At current prices, this will be insanely undervalued even with a small hit, and a 100+ bagger long term if the basin lives up to the predictions of the geologists. There's a very good [investor presentation](https://vimeo.com/480128335) from last November that covers the geology of the play and I highly recommend you take a look at it. Furthermore, from what I can tell from the investor forums, I believe owners of the stock so far have primarily been oil industry investors. We haven\u2019t seen a retail spike in RECAF yet so I can foresee a nice bump as more investors learn about the company and take the time to put in serious DD. At these levels, I consider Recon to be a very strong investment to put 10% of your portfolio in, and a serious contender for an early retirement stock.\n\n**Tl;dr** The last remaining onshore sedimentary basin in the world containing potentially hundreds of billions of dollars worth of oil and petroleum equivalents, and it is owned by one small company that is currently flying under the radar.",

        "selftext": "$ASO is Academy sports and outdoors. They are a sports equipment store and a hunting store that sells guns &amp; ammo. I would describe them similar to Dick's but more focused on their core selling points, they aren't spending money making their stores look like a extravegent mall. I have been too ASO many times and overall enjoy their store &amp; from my personal experience they have been consistently busy this past year and the days ammo arrives there is always a line around the building at 7 am of people trying to get some before they sell out. \n\nASO IPO'd in October of 2020. ASO is a fundamentally undervalued stock. Last week they absolutely smashed earnings by doubling EPS. Estimated was .46 and actual was 1.09 Their revenue increased as well. Their net sales increased 18% over last year. They have a market cap of 2.63 B and trade at a P/E of 7.66 as compared to Dick's which trades at a P/E of 13.85.  As you can see this stock is criminally undervalued as compareded to its peers. IPO lockup period ended on 3/31 which caused a negative dip on open that day but the stock finished postive on the day as there was not a mass sell off as shorters of the stock had hoped for. \n\n The stock has been shorted from the start because I believe it was just lumped into the typical brick &amp; mortar category and will just assumed would bleed out due to online shopping. This was a grave miscalculation as ASO provides a niche varitey of products that the online space is not fulfiilling adequetly &amp; their top compeitor Dicks has been backing out of like guns and ammo. They have a current short interest of 39% with a public float of 31 M. The stock currently is at a all time high of $29, that means every single instution that shorted this stock is negative now and they have 9 days to cover their positions. With some more volume and upward pressure in this stock and we could see a squeeze similair to the one that happened with RKT. I don't see this stock tripling or anything of the scale that GME had but I do see a substaintial price increase soon if the right factors materialize. \n\nOpen interest for 4/16 30 strike calls are huge and if the volume comes in and pushes the stock up we could be looking at quite the squeeze for this bad boy. \n\nTLDR: ASO is a fundamentally undervalued stock that is currently trading at a ATH with high short interest which makes it prime for a squeeze. \n\nPositions: (9) 4/16 30 strike &amp;  (2) 4/16 25 strike calls \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not financial advice spend your money however you choose.",

        "selftext": "With so many exciting developments of late, I wanted to share my .02 on the current state of the uranium market, focusing a bit on SWU, which I am very fond of haha. As always, I look forward to any feedback.  \n\nAs am sure all are aware, we have seen a 15% jump in spot over last 2 weeks. While the increase was in large part to non-producing mines physical purchasing , I noticed a number of discussions on Reddit and various Discord servers, StockTwits also, seeming to suggest that this uptick in spot U was indicative of where we are in the current fuel cycle.\n\nExperienced investors in this sector will tell you however that this couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\n\nRather, a more powerful indicator as to where we are in the cycle is by looking at the SWU enrichment price.\n\nBased in large part on SWU projections, many expert investors are forecasting a $500bn market. For perspective, during the last cycle, the market peaked at \\~$150bn.\n\n***So... what is SWU?***\n\nFor those very new to uranium investing, a very quick overview might be helpful. Also, for those more familiar than I am, I appreciate the feedback.\n\nSWU (short for Separative Work Unit) is a measure for the cost of enrichment. Generally speaking, when SWU prices are low, utilities benefit by purchasing excess enrichment inventory at cheap prices using intermediaries (i.e., carry trades).\n\nConversely, a rise in SWU signifies that the demand for enrichment is growing. As excess inventories are utilized by end users, the utilities (no longer aided by the secondary market) instead turn to the uranium producers to purchase future contracts at much higher prices. It follows logically that higher enrichment prices force the utilities to retreat back into the fuel cycle; from conversion (UF6) and even fabricated fuel purchasing, to the beginning (i.e. spot U308), which in turn drives those spot prices up.\n\nAdditionally, and perhaps most importantly, higher SWU prices on future contracts are essential in incentivizing the mines to come back online. McArthur and Cigar Lake, for example, need at least the $40's, and for Paladin, likely in the $50s in order to justify their operational costs.\n\nTherefore, **SWU is arguably the best indicator of where we are in the fuel cycle**.\n\nEven when there are false starts/spikes in the market (which we\u2019ve seen in the past couple years), SWU price is consistent.\n\n***What is the current SWU price?***\n\nSWU bottomed out at $\\~34 in August 2018 after so much excess accumulated in the years following Fukushima.\n\nSince hitting that low, SWU has been on a relative straight line upwards, currently estimated at \\~$54. This steady growth over the past 2.5 years is one of, if not the most, compelling reason investors are so confident of a long bull market to come in this sector.\n\n***So... how the \\*\\*\\*\\* is SWU forecasting a $500bn market?!***\n\nOf course, there are a number of things we can look at that are driving this thing. It's becoming almost a daily occurrence now to see catalysts emerging (i.e., breaking news this week on EU Green energy qualifications, the White House endorsing nuclear in as part of the clean energy standard).\n\nHowever, more-so than anything SWU is at the core of the bull thesis, which is, that ***decarbonization of the electrical grid around the world is not possible without nuclear power*** (Duke Energy Corp. just said the same yesterday...)\n\nAs SWU prices continue to rise, **it is inevitable that equity prices will follow**. Denison is a fun example. \n\nEven now , I'm still amazed at how many people claiming to have thousands of shares of certain uranium producers are surprised when they hear that Denison isn't actually producing any uranium. When utilities start executing term contracts with other producers at SWU in the $60s, $70s, $80s, and beyond, those mines will turn the lights back on. The fact that they just bought spot above market is a pretty powerful indication of where things are headed as far as volume on these long term contracts. It won't be long before Denison\u2019s prices start to rise. The same idea goes with Cominak, Ranger, etc.\n\nMoreover, what happens when we've exhausted Cigar Lake and Kazatomprom? Or McArthur River? \n\nIt isn't just that we have a rising demand, we need new projects coming into existence now in order to avoid a huge deficit in supply between 2025-2030. The investment opportunities on these projects are extremely exciting. \n\n***And why $500bn***? \n\nFrankly, I think $500bn is conservative, though something in this vicinity I have seen as the consensus among many experts. Market cap for publicly traded uranium is at 125bn right now, and this is only the very beginning. Ultimately, there are new players in the game with a ton of liquidity (i.e., hedge funds), and they are looking for value. Taking $URNM as one example, the AUM just months ago when it IPO'd was a few million. Now AUM is $175mm. We also cannot ignore what is happening in China. It is a huge growth story there. There is also a SPEC frenzy.  \n\nBut again, looking at the big picture, more-so than anything else, I keep going back to SWU. For me, it is the most powerful predictor of the multi-year bull run to come. And while there will always be doubtful retail who, to their credit, have rightfully called false starts over the last couple years, you cannot deny what 2.5 years of rising SWU enrichment prices means for where we are in the current cycle.\n\nAgain, I would be very interested to hear where folks agree/disagree. Any and all feedback is appreciated!",

A team of world-renowned oil exploration experts discovered a new, unexplored basin in Namibia and Botswana and promptly secured exploration rights to the entire area. ReconAfrica has purchased a drilling rig specifically for this drilling program and is working on confirming the presence of hydrocarbons in the Kavango Basin with [strong support](https://www.namibian.com.na/99647/read/Shifeta-defends-oil-drilling?fbclid=IwAR1PXrk8r5B4EpMfIW3x-r_acmH8e4vjh0q0GkGfDR9F__I_hmbT-_LRX6c) from the Namibian government.\n\nThe basin\u2019s age, size, and depth could make it the biggest oil discovery in recent history, resulting in [ReconAfrica becoming a potential African oil major](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4397342-reconnaissance-energy-africa-potential-future-major-african-oil-and-gas-company).\n\n**\\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_** \n\n**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ SHORT TERM OPPORTUNITY**\n\nReconAfrica\u2019s drilling program currently consists of drilling 3 wells to confirm the presence of a working hydrocarbon system in the Kavango basin. An oversubscribed round of [funding](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/RECON-Update-3_25-Warrants_VOK2_Final.pdf) has just been completed, removing the need for any short term capital raise or share dilution for the foreseeable future. Well #1 total depth was projected for the [end of March](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/Haywood-ReconAfrica-022521.pdf) and **an announcement is expected soon**. At the same time, the 450km 2D seismic program is expected to obtain approval shortly. These are significant milestones with a potential **2x upside** from the current \\~CDN$3.5 / \\~USD$2.5 to arrive at the [current price target of CAD$7.0](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/Haywood-ReconAfrica-022521.pdf). The spudding of the second well and its completion is expected to be the next near-term catalyst. \n\nHowever, **the biggest near-term catalyst** awaits at the completion of Well #3. The drilling program requires all three wells being drilled to Total Depth (TD) before the release of any information about commercial productivity (see \u201cThe Plan\u201d). When Well #3 is completed, we get to see whether we have oil, as well as indications about possible quantities. \n\nHere is where it gets difficult to estimate an upside and numbers become speculative. The sheer size of the basin and the scale of potential reserves have inspired some wild share price [estimates](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/ReconAfrica-Investor-Presentation-092019.pdf) of [US$70](https://www.wallstreet-online.de/_plain/_shared/default/image?url=//assets.wallstreet-online.de/_media/10511/board/20201209122208-reconnaissance-energy-africa-shale-play-valuation.jpg). I think this is unlikely. But because of the very high estimated potential reserves, I expect that a successful oil show could make share prices around CDN$24 / US$19 possible. An **\\~x8 upside**. It could be greater or smaller depending on the indications for oil quantity and quality. See \u201cThe Valuation\u201d. \n\nThe analyst firm Haywood Securities is tracking the progress of the drilling program and the catalysts, providing [update analyses and share price targets](https://reconafrica.com/investors/analyst-reports/). The last share price rally happened as the rig arrived and the drilling began - an important de-risking milestone. See \u201cThe Technicals\u201d for a summary of past price history and a technical analysis of the price chart. \n\n**\\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_** \n\n**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ LONG TERM SPECULATION**\n\nOnce the presence of a working hydrocarbon system is confirmed, the company will enter a [farm-out deal](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/farmout.asp#:~:text=Farmout%20is%20the%20assignment%20of,exploration%20blocks%20or%20drilling%20acreage) to raise the funds needed to move to the appraisal stage, where the basin is thoroughly mapped and the estimates of its oil content are confirmed with the certainty required for production. Early expert estimates put the resource at 1.2 billion barrels, while more recent estimates put it between 40 and 120 billion (see \u201cThe Resource\u201d). \n\nIf we have 1.2 billion barrels, we get a nice rally. This is a quantity somewhat comparable to the 88 Energy opportunity.\n\n**However, If we have 40 billion or 120 billion barrels, then Namibia (a 2.5m population country) finds itself with resources close to the ones** [**in America or Kuwait**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_proven_oil_reserves)**.** [**ReconAfrica could become a next oil major**](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4397342-reconnaissance-energy-africa-potential-future-major-african-oil-and-gas-company)**.** \n\nYou could argue that estimating the share price if this happens is meaningless, but I made an attempt - see \u201cThe Valuation\u201d. \n\n**\\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_** \n\n**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ THE TEAM**\n\n*Sources: ReconAfrica website, LinkedIn, Google.*\n\n**Craig Steinke, the Founder,** has previously founded [Renaissance Oil](http://renaissanceoil.com/).

Below is a summary:\n\nAfter Craig Steinke\u2019s last project (see \u201cThe Team\u201d), the exploration expert bought a shale and source rock database from [IHS Markit](https://ihsmarkit.com/index.html) (one just like [this one](https://ihsmarkit.com/products/oil-gas-field-reservoir-discoveries.html)), hired four international geologists and tried to find overlooked opportunities. He found ST-1, a **1964 Etosha Petroleum** well, which identified 620\u2019 permian shale. While this early exploration effort found source rock, it failed to find oil, and further attempts were hampered by the political situation in Namibia at the time. You can find more details about other exploration efforts in the area [here](http://www.searchanddiscovery.com/pdfz/documents/2014/10609hoak/ndx_hoak.pdf.html). \n\nThe oil exploration industry has come a long way since 1964, and Craig had a hunch that Etosha was drilled in a shallower part of the basin. The team believed that the basement depth increased as you move further to the east. Craig contacted the Namibian government and found that they had an un-analysed aeromagnetic study available ([aeromagnetic surveys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeromagnetic_survey) are used to visualise the geological structure of the upper crust). Based on his hunch and little else, **he preemptively acquired both the aeromag and the exploration rights.** [This contract](https://www.sedar.com/GetFile.do?lang=EN&amp;docClass=13&amp;issuerNo=00008235&amp;issuerType=03&amp;projectNo=03088140&amp;docId=4767862) was very much in Namibia\u2019s interest, as it committed ReconAfrica to spend a minimum $5m on exploration, as well as pay N$2m in licence fees and US$50,000 in Namibian training and education fund contributions per year (page 38 [here](http://www.eia.met.gov.na/screening/2250_public_and_stakeholders_consultions_materials_march_2021.pdf)).\n\nThe aeromag analysis was done by Bill Cathey (see \u201cThe Team\u201d). He found a **huge, completely unexplored 30,000\u2019 deep sedimentary basin\u2026** and the rest is history**.** He describes it in detail in his [conference presentation](https://youtu.be/sgniBroy2YQ?t=3068), and you can find a basic summary [here](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/Bill-Cathey-ReconAfrica-Aeromagnetic-Analysis-1.pdf). You can also find Dan Jarvie\u2019s perspective on the finding [here](https://www.yahoo.com/news/largest-oil-play-decade-interview-000000645.html). \n\n**\\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_** \n\n**\\\\\\\\\\\\ THE RESOURCE**\n\nWood Mackenzie, [a world-leading consultancy group, estimated](https://www.woodmac.com/) the Kavango basin to be [most similar to the US Midland (Permian) Basin](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/Wood-Mac-Kavango-Basin-and-Global-Benchmarking-Nov-2020.pdf). The Permian has produced 33 billion barrels of oil ($1.8 trillion @ $55 per barrel) since 1921. It currently accounts for 20% of US crude production. ReconAfrica holds exploration rights to the entire Kavango basin, see \u201cThe Deal\u201d.\n\nWe are still in early stages and don\u2019t know much about the basin apart from its immense size and depth, as well as, according to Bill Cathey, the fact that there is no basin of this depth in the world that doesn\u2019t produce hydrocarbons.\n\nAn early estimate came to [1.2 billion barrels](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/Sproule-Report-ReconAfrica-July-2020.pdf) (which, as the most conservative analysis, is used by [analysts](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/ReconAfrica-Haywood-Report-November-2020.pdf) for share price targets), while a later estimate by Chief Geochemist Dan Jarvie came to between [40 and 120 billion barrels](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/Dan-Jarvie-ReconAfrica-Geochemical-Analysis-1.pdf). You can watch Jarvie present his analysis at an [American Petroleum Institute conference](https://youtu.be/sgniBroy2YQ?t=3815), or read an [interview of his](https://www.yahoo.com/news/largest-oil-play-decade-interview-000000645.html). \n\n[An excerpt from a leaked investor presentation](https://youtu.be/-Kknjo3ygU4?t=1127): \u201cDan does believe \\[...\\] he is conservative. \\[...\\] The numbers are already so large that we don\u2019t need to press the numbers to make a compelling investment case\u201d\n\nWe will have to wait for more data to see which estimate is closer to the truth, and whether Jarvie is correct in being conservative. **But even if his lowest estimate pans out, we are in oil major territory**. [A quick google reveals Exxon currently has 15 billion barrels](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Exxon-Shocks-As-Oil-Reserves-Drop-By-A-Third.html#:~:text=Exxon%20slashed%20its%20oil%20reserves,billion%20barrels%20a%20year%20earlier.). That is the potential scale of this play. \n\n**&gt;&gt;&gt;WHAT ABOUT FRACKING?**\n\nIf you work in O&amp;G in America, you will have little choice but to be heavily involved in fracking: the conventional resources have practically run out. This is why many of the ReconAfrica team have a fracking background, and why a lot of the early ReconAfrica documents mention fracking - it makes it more comparable to the current US plays. However, fracking is never the first choice due to its financial and environmental cost, as the company [repeatedly stated](https://twitter.com/Recon_Africa/status/1371571724559519748?s=20). \n\nReconAfrica is currently in the **exploration stage** and its mission is to confirm both [conventional and unconventional](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/ReconAfrica-Investor-Presentation.pdf) resources, so that Recon and the Namibian government know what is in the ground. Any production licences and discussions come further down the line. See \u201cThe Environment\u201d. \n\n**\\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_** \n\n**\\\\\\\\\\\\ THE PLAN &amp; THE CATALYSTS**\n\nReconAfrica\u2019s exploration work is \u201cde-risking\u201d the basin in stages. **The current stage is confirming the presence of a working hydrocarbon system** through two stratigraphic wells, followed by 450km of 2D seismic and a trap well. [Stratigraphic wells](https://www.rigzone.com/training/insight.asp?insight_id=298&amp;c_id=) will acquire cores and well logging to map geological strata. [Seismography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_seismology) allows you to map subsurface features. [Trap wells](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Oil_and_gas_traps) look to hit oil. Well 1 should be complete near the end of March. Well 2 (\\~30 days) and the seismic will take place concurrently, so the final well (also \\~30 days) will be complete July earliest, and realistically at the start of Q3. \n\nWell #1 completion and 2D seismic study approval are expected to be the next big catalysts, followed by Well #2 and the exciting Well #3 which will **look for oil.** The data from the wells will be used to obtain a more accurate picture of the basin\u2019s contents. ReconAfrica will need this information to negotiate a **farm-out deal**, where they offer a % interest in the resource in exchange for the funds to complete the appraisal. \n\n**They will not release interim technical results** until the whole program is complete, so that they can be in the best negotiating position. However, they promised **plenty of operational updates**. Please review [the investor presentation from 18th January 2021 for details](https://youtu.be/-Kknjo3ygU4). \n\n**ReconAfrica is planning to negotiate the farm-out this summer.** It will bring in lots of capital, considerably de-risk the project, and be a big catalyst.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to put a SP estimate upon an oil show at the end of the program. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it **takes us to CDN$24 / US$19**, or more if the well logs indicate that we are closer to a 40 billion barrel situation than a 1 billion barrel situation - see the next section. Securing the farm-out deal will happen shortly after, serving as **another catalyst**.\n\nAfter this comes the appraisal of the entire basin\u2019s resources, with further wells and 3D seismic. As it goes on, **we should be getting closer and closer to the real picture of what\u2019s in the basin.** All current price targets are based on the most conservative target of 1.2bb. If early signs show we are closer to 40bb, the game changes dramatically.\n\nAs a small outfit ReconAfrica will **not develop the entire basin themselves.** That would take insane scale. Instead, they will seek to sign farm-out deals with large oil majors and secure crazy royalties. However, since they have in-house development experience, they will seek to produce as much as they can themselves as well (as mentioned [here](https://youtu.be/-Kknjo3ygU4)). \n\n**\\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_** \n\n**\\\\\\\\\\\\ THE VALUATION**\n\nValuing exploration oil companies is tough. We still don\u2019t know much about the Kavango basin apart from its immense size and depth. The original estimate of reserves by Sproule came to 1.2bn barrels, while the later Jarvie estimate came between 40 and 120bb. [Haywood reports](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/Haywood-ReconAfrica-022521.pdf) provide pricing (in CDN$) **based on the most conservative estimate** and \u201cchances of commerciality\u201d. This chance increases the closer we get to confirming the resource.\n\nI have found a [useful calculator](https://jscalc.io/calc/uJqKwGWLiSqOuoxA) someone made on another board, based on a model from [SeekingAlpha](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4334114-drilling-for-oil-in-stock-market) which uses assumptions from [this paper](https://scholarworks.uark.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1044&amp;context=anrlaw). Assuming a 20% farm-out cut, US$55 per barrel and a 33% profit margin on each one, I estimated the USD share price (along with the upside from the current \\~US$2.5) for the different reserve estimates. I also looked at a [recent massive farm-out deal by Rosneft](https://www.reuters.com/article/rosneft-results/update-2-rosneft-holds-talks-with-global-traders-india-and-china-on-vostok-oil-project-idUSL1N2KI0KT) and applied the same valuation to ReconAfrica\u2019s reserves for comparison.\n\n**The prices are in USD with upside potential based on the current price of \\~US$2.5 in brackets.**\n\n|PRICES USD|Analyst reports|Model|Model|Model|Rosneft deal|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Bn barrels|Haywood|Reserves probable|Reserves proven|Reserves producing|US$2 per barrel deal|\n|1.2|$36.9 (x15)|$6.2 (x2)|$11.1 (x4)|$24.6 (x10)|$13.4 (x5)|\n|40|$1,231 (x492)|$207 (x83)|$370 (x148)|$820 (x328)|$448 (x179)|\n|120|$3,693 (x1477)|$620 (x248)|$1,110 (x444)|$2,460 (x984)|$1,345 (x538)|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can kind of see why the analyst share price targets stuck to the earlier, most conservative estimate, as the **numbers get stupid very quickly**. In reality, I am sure these will be tempered by the actual farm-out agreements, further capital raises and the sheer time it takes to extract 40bn barrels (but note that the numbers above already assume a 20% royalty cut to account for farm-out deals). \n\nThis is what happens when you find a huge, overlooked basin and snatch the rights to the entire area. If you would like to see more detail on the 40-120bb estimate, I recommend Dan Jarvie\u2019s [conference presentation](https://youtu.be/sgniBroy2YQ?t=3815).\n\n**\\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_** \n\n**\\\\\\\\\\\\ THE DEAL**\n\n**ReconAfrica\u2019s work** is currently subject to the [Petroleum Agreement](https://www.sedar.com/GetFile.do?lang=EN&amp;docClass=13&amp;issuerNo=00008235&amp;issuerType=03&amp;projectNo=03088140&amp;docId=4767862) with the Namibian government, giving them rights to an enormous 6.3m acre (\\~27,000km2) area, and a similar agreement with the Botswana government for 2.2m acres (\\~8,900km2). \n\n**In Namibia,** The Namibian state oil company NAMCOR holds a 10% stake in the exploration licence. Namibia gets a [5% royalty and a 35% corporate tax](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/ReconAfrica-Investor-Presentation.pdf), ensuring that a good portion of the profits will benefit the country\u2019s economy. \n\nOnce the exploration phases are complete, the company has **secured the right** to enter into a 25 year **production licence** with a NAMCOR stake to be negotiated, as specified in the [Petroleum Agreement](https://www.sedar.com/GetFile.do?lang=EN&amp;docClass=13&amp;issuerNo=00008235&amp;issuerType=03&amp;projectNo=03088140&amp;docId=4767862) and the recent seismic [Environmental Impact Assessment](http://www.eia.met.gov.na/screening/2250_vol_2_of_3_eia_report_for_the_proposed_2d_seismic_survey_of_aoi_in_pel_73_kavango_east_and_west_regions_march_2021.pdf). \n\n**In Botswana,** ReconAfrica holds a 100% working interest in all the petroleum in the area. The work is currently at the permit obtaining stage. Royalties will be [3% - 10% and a 22% corporate income tax](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/ReconAfrica-Investor-Presentation.pdf).\n\n**\\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_** \n\n**\\\\\\\\\\\\ THE RISKS**\n\n**Short-term risk** is mainly in the 3 well program failing to find oil. In this scenario, the share price will likely suffer a significant drop. However, since the company has already secured additional funding, it would simply mean additional delay (see \u201cThe Fundamentals\u201d).\n\n**Longer-term risks** include:\n\n* Failure to confirm oil with further wells. In this case, share price goes to 0.\n* The basin not yielding a commercialisable resource. In this case, the share price also goes to 0.\n* The basin yielding only an unconventional (fracking) resource, the extraction of which will encounter considerable opposition.\n* Environmental concerns halting exploration. While we are getting increasing news exposure, I consider this extremely unlikely, as the exploration stage involves no oil production and has minimal environmental impact. **As long as there is the prospect for any oil, the Namibian government will want to find out whether it\u2019s there.**\n* Oil prices going down. I don\u2019t consider this to be a major risk with oil prices projected to increase with reflation, and conventional oil being relatively cheap to extract. The oil prices will be far more relevant to the production stage, which will happen further down the line. Hear Craig talk about this [here at around 17:00](https://podcasts.apple.com/mr/podcast/africas-kavango-basin-craig-steinke-founder-recon-africa/id1450833136?i=1000498202543).\n\n*This is very much a high risk, high reward, near-binary play.*\n\n**\\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_** \n\n**\\\\\\\\\\\\ THE \u201cFUNDAMENTALS\u201d**\n\nAs a junior oil exploration company, ReconAfrica is not a fundamentals based opportunity. However, they have:\n\n* Their own [1,000hp drilling rig](https://reconafrica.com/operations/crown-750-1000-hp-drilling-rig/). Rig ownership reduces costs by 60%.\n* [Funds for the entire program](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/ReconAfrica-Closing-2020-08-20.pdf) (3 wells + seismic) with $4m margin leftover.\n* Additional [\\~$33m](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/RECON-Update-3_25-Warrants_VOK2_Final.pdf) from a recent warrants release.\n* [Zero debt.](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/ReconAfrica-Investor-Presentation.pdf)\n\nThis means they have sufficient funds to take their time and get it right, as well as to complete **up to 6 additional wells** if required at [\\~$4m per well](https://leedejonesgable.com/wp-content/uploads/reconafrica-0811.pdf)  \\- all without **any additional dilution.** Note that this is based on my own calculations from their financial statements, and not on company commitments. \n\n**\\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_** \n\n**\\\\\\\\\\\\ THE TECHNICALS** \n\n**The last catalyst was caused by the start of drilling on January 10th**, and had an x2 upside. Recently, the price has suffered a bit due to the well delay and the ongoing macro conditions. Due to low volume in-between the catalysts, it tends to track the Russell 2000. Recently, a massive **bullish pennant** has been forming, which together with low volume is showing the price is well-consolidated for a new catalyst. This stock is still flying under the radar. \n\n**I made some charts for you:**\n\n* [A chart with the last rally and all the major events.](https://i.imgur.com/OGPuMRZ.png)\n* [A tidier chart showing all events since November 2020.](https://i.imgur.com/eUxI0Fx.png)\n* [A chart showing how RECO has drifted on market sentiment in March.](https://i.imgur.com/70YMWNg.png)\n* [A chart showing the bullish pennant.](https://i.imgur.com/UicDl0N.png)\n* [A chart showing the tip of the pennant, the \u201ccatalyst launchpad\u201d and the most relevant support levels right now.](https://i.imgur.com/BiOx0F4.png)\n\nImgur seems to be reducing resolution on mobile, so if you\u2019re on a phone, try \u201cRequest Desktop Site\u201d or view these links on a computer.\n\n**\\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_** \n\n**\\\\\\\\\\\\ THE ENVIRONMENT**\n\nThere has been some environmental news coverage of ReconAfrica\u2019s efforts. A lot of the articles don\u2019t seem to grasp that **ReconAfrica is in the exploration stage** with the goal of confirming the presence of oil. If oil is confirmed, it will take some time and negotiation to get to production. I expect the negotiations to get quite political. This does not affect us for this phase. ReconAfrica is under contract with the Namibian government to **tell their country how much oil they have.** \n\nIf the government finds itself in possession of an **oil resource the size of Kuwait\u2019s**, it will have to choose whether the benefits of extraction outweigh possible environmental risks. I look at this play as a low environmental impact **oil exploration opportunity** with the goal of confirming the resource and fully appraising it. What happens after dramatically changes depending on what quantity of oil is found. \n\n**ReconAfrica is fully in compliance with Namibia\u2019s stringent environmental protection laws:** they are using an expensive, biodegradable and fully [environmentally safe](https://www.energy-pedia.com/news/namibia/new-182148) drilling fluid**.** The seismic analysis has been subject to a detailed [Environmental Impact Assessment](http://www.eia.met.gov.na/screening/2250_vol_2_of_3_eia_report_for_the_proposed_2d_seismic_survey_of_aoi_in_pel_73_kavango_east_and_west_regions_march_2021.pdf) and [Environmental Management Plan](http://www.eia.met.gov.na/screening/2250_vol_3_of_3_emp_report_for_the_proposed_2d_seismic_survey_of_aoi_in_pel_73_kavango_east_and_west_regions_march_2021.pdf), with [extensive local consultation](http://www.eia.met.gov.na/screening/2250_public_and_stakeholders_consultions_materials_march_2021.pdf).

See [a recent TV interview](https://www.facebook.com/www.nbcnews.na/videos/793867861512115) for the view of the Namibian government.\n\n**\\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_** \n\n**\\\\\\\\\\\\ THE COUNTRY**\n\n**Namibia** represents the lion\u2019s share of the Kavango basin\u2019s area. It is a former German colony, gaining independence from South Africa in 1990. A stable, multi-party parliamentary democracy, [Namibia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namibia) has a small population of 2.5m people with a nominal GDP of US$14.15bn. \n\nFor comparison, the most conservative estimate of 1.2bn barrels would generate a revenue of US$66bn at US$55 per barrel. With over [20% unemployment](https://www.statista.com/statistics/808804/unemployment-rate-in-namibia/), and being one of the few countries in the area [with no proven oil reserves](https://www.ecooilandgas.com/bp-pursues-namibia-crude-amid-no-known-discovery-of-oil-energy/#:~:text=Namibia%2C%20sandwiched%20between%20Angola%2C%20South,to%20generate%20power%20this%20year.), **it simply** **cannot afford not to produce oil.** Under the current deal, the government will receive 35% corporate tax, and 5% in royalties and 10% through its stake in the area. [Recent government statements](https://www.namibian.com.na/99647/read/Shifeta-defends-oil-drilling?fbclid=IwAR1PXrk8r5B4EpMfIW3x-r_acmH8e4vjh0q0GkGfDR9F__I_hmbT-_LRX6c) and [TV interviews](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=793867861512115&amp;ref=watch_permalink) show strong support of ReconAfrica\u2019s current efforts.

        "selftext": "Hello, this is gonna be my first post on here. I've been a lurker for 2 years and only created this account recently. Anyways, I want to hear some people's opinions on here about two different strategies I've been mind juggling for a while now. \n\nThe strategy of never selling is simple and what I pretty much stuck with since I started investing until recently. I think it's best to never sell if you plan on investing some money here and there into some long term funds or ETFs. But recently (late last year before this massive rotation) I sold profits on a few stocks that I did really well on and reinvested into a bunch of other things. I was doing really well on all of my picks, and with these past 2 months all of my precious gains disappeared. Of course, hindsight is a bitch, and I wish I had taken profits on most of those and then bought the dip because I still have a strong conviction. Which leaves me thinking about a new strategy, specifically for my volatile growth stonks. \n\nThe strategy of profit taking would have me taking some profits here and there if I make a certain % amount, and then keeping that cash as buying power for dips, bears and rotations. I think this works really well with volatile growth stocks because volatile growth stocks have shown to be able to run up anywhere from 15-50% in a single day or even more depending on the stock. I don't have many stonks like those, but I do have stocks that rally and pullback. If a certain sector or security I'm invested in grows a significant amount in a couple weeks or a couple months, it will almost definitely pullback soon after. This mindset would also help me not feel as bad about selling during a bear market.\n\nSome things to consider:  \n\\-I have a Roth for retirement, and a regular portfolio.                                                                                                 -I am in my early 20's so I have time and the money invested isn't necessary right now or soon.                         -I like the stock",

        "selftext": "\n\nJul. 25, 2014 10:54 AM\n\nPublished courtesy of\u00a0Citizens for Securities Reform, at\u00a0http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html\n\nAbusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.\n\nThe plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill-gotten gain.\n\nWhen it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.\n\nTypical tactics include the following:\n\nFlooding the offer side of the board - Ultimately the price of a stock is found at the balance point where supply (offer) and demand (bid) for the shares find equilibrium. This equation happens every day for every stock traded. On days when more people want to buy than want to sell, the price goes up, and, conversely, when shares offered for sale exceed the demand, the price goes down.\n\nThe shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares. They will do what has been called a short down ladder. It works as follows: Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit.\n\nBy repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral. If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of \"strategic fails-to-deliver\" and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand. Attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit. Company news days are frequently attack days since the news will \"mask\" the extraordinary high volume. It doesn't matter whether it is good news or bad news.\n\nFlooding the market with shares requires foot soldiers to swamp the market with counterfeit shares. An off-shore hedge fund devised a remarkably effective incentive program to motivate the traders at certain broker dealers. Each trader was given a debit card to a bank account that only he could access. The trader's performance was tallied, and, based upon the number of shares moved and the other \"success\" parameters; the hedge fund would wire money into the bank account daily. At the end of each day, the traders went to an ATM and drew out their bribe. Instant gratification.\n\nGlobal Links Corporation is an example of how wholesale counterfeiting of shares will decimate a company's stock price. Global Links is a company that provides computer services to the real estate industry. By early 2005, their stock price had dropped to a fraction of a cent. At that point, an investor, Robert Simpson, purchased 100%+ of Global Links' 1,158,064 issued and outstanding shares. He immediately took delivery of his shares and filed the appropriate forms with the SEC, disclosing he owned all of the company's stock. His total investment was $5205. The share price was $.00434. The day after he acquired all of the company's shares, the volume on the over-the-counter market was 37 million shares. The following day saw 22 million shares change hands - all without Simpson trading a single share. It is possible that the SEC has been conducting a secret investigation, but that would be difficult without the company's involvement. It is more likely the SEC has not done anything about this fraud.\n\nMassive counterfeiting can drive the stock price down in a matter of hours on extremely high volume. This is called \"crashing\" the stock and a successful \"crash\" is a one-day drop of twenty-percent or a thirty-five percent drop in a week. In order to make the crash \"stick\" or make it more effective, it is done concurrently with all or most of the following:\n\nMedia Assault -\n\nThe shorts, in order to realize their profit, must ultimately put the victim into bankruptcy or obtain shares at a price much cheaper than what they shorted at. These shares come from the investing public who panics and sells into the manipulation. Panic is induced with assistance from the financial media.\n\nThe shorts have \"friendly\" reporters with the Dow Jones News Agency, the\u00a0Wall Street Journal,\u00a0Barrons, the\u00a0New York Times, Gannett Publications (USA Today\u00a0and the\u00a0Arizona Republic), CNBC and others. The common thread: A number of the \"friendly\" reporters worked for The Street.com, an Internet advisory service that short hedge-fund managers David Rocker and Jim Cramer owned. This alumni association supported the short attack by producing slanted, libelous, innuendo laden stories that disparaged the company, as it was being crashed.\n\nOne of the more outrageous stories was a front-page story in\u00a0USA Today\u00a0during a short crash of TASER's stock price in June 2005. The story was almost a full page and the reporter concluded that TASER's electrical jolt was the same as an electric chair - proof positive that TASERs did indeed kill innocent people. To reach that conclusion the reporter over estimated the TASER's amperage by a factor of one million times. This \"mistake\" was made despite a detailed technical briefing by TASER to seven\u00a0USA Today\u00a0editors two weeks prior to the story. The explanation \"Due to a mathematical error\" appeared three days later - after the damage was done to the stock price.\n\nJim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:\n\nWhen (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.\n\nThis interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube.\n\nAnalyst Reports -\n\nSome alleged independent analysts were actually paid by the shorts to write slanted negative ratings reports. The reports, which were represented as being independent, were ghost written by the shorts and disseminated to coincide with a short attack. There is congressional testimony in the matter of Gradiant Analytic and Rocker Partners that expands upon this. These libelous reports would then become a story in the aforementioned \"friendly\" media. All were designed to panic small investors into selling their stock into the manipulation.\n\nPlanting moles in target companies -\n\nThe shorts plant \"moles\" inside target companies. The moles can be as high as directors or as low as janitors. They steal confidential information, which is fed to the shorts who may feed it to the friendly media. The information may not be true, may be out of context, or the stolen documents may be altered. Things that are supposed to be confidential, like SEC preliminary inquiries, end up as front-page news with the short-friendly media.\n\nFrivolous SEC investigations -\n\nThe shorts \"leak\" tips to the SEC about \"corporate malfeasance\" by the target company. The SEC, which can take months processing Freedom of Information Act requests, swoops in as the supposed \"confidential inquiry\" is leaked to the short media.\n\nThe plethora of corporate rules means the SEC may ultimately find minor transgressions or there may be no findings. Occasionally they do uncover an Enron, but the initial leak can be counted on to drive the stock price down by twenty-five percent. The announcement of no or little findings comes months later, but by then the damage that has been done to the stock price is irreversible. The San Francisco office of the SEC appears to be particularly close to the short community.\n\nClass Action lawsuits -\n\nBased upon leaked stories of SEC investigations or other media exposes, a handful of law firms immediately file class-action shareholder suits. Milberg Weiss, before they were disbanded as a result of a Justice Department investigation, could be counted on to file a class-action suit against a company that was under short attack. Allegations of accounting improprieties that were made in the complaint would be reported as being the truth by the short friendly media, again causing panic among small investors.\n\nInterfering with target company's customers, financings, etc. -\n\nIf the shorts became aware of clients, customers or financings that the target company was working on, they would call and tell lies or otherwise attempt to persuade the customer to abandon the transaction. Allegedly the shorts have gone so far as to bribe public officials to dissuade them from using a company's product.\n\nPulling margin from long customers -\n\nThe clearinghouses and broker dealers who finance margin accounts will suddenly pull all long margin availability, citing very transparent reasons for the abrupt change in lending policy. This causes a flood of margin selling, which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares that they need to cover. (Click here for more on\u00a0Pulling Margin).\n\nPaid bashers -\n\nThe shorts will hire paid bashers who \"invade\" the message boards of the company. The bashers disguise themselves as legitimate investors and try to persuade or panic small investors into selling into the manipulation. (Click here for\u00a0Confessions Of A Paid Stock Basher).\n\nThis is not every trick the shorts use when they are crashing the stock. Almost every victim company experiences most or all of these tactics.\n\nHow Pervasive Is This?\n\nAt any given point in time more than 100 emerging companies are under attack as described above. This is not to be confused with the day-to-day shorting that occurs in virtually every stock, which is purportedly about thirty percent of the daily volume.\n\nThe success rate for short attacks is over ninety percent-a success being defined as putting the company into bankruptcy or driving the stock price to pennies. It is estimated that 1000 small companies have been put out of business by the shorts. Admittedly, not every small company deserves to succeed, but they do deserve a level playing field.\n\nThe secrecy that surrounds the shorts, the prime brokers, the DTC and the regulatory agencies makes it impossible to accurately estimate how much money has been stolen from the investing public by these predators, but the total is measured in billions of dollars. The problem is also international in scope.\n\nTo learn more go to\u00a0http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html\n\nDisclosure:\u00a0The author is long KNDI.",

I am well aware that those are one of the most important fundamental elements when valuing a business and I did spend a lot of time on them while doing my research, before ultimately deciding to invest in the company. However I believe that most of the redditors on this forum , especially those that are already investors, already have at least basic understanding of PLTR's financial situation and the specifications of its software. In this thesis I will try to give my perspective about why I think PLTR is a low bottom company with significant potential for growth, based on more \"abstract\" and less known factors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nFirst of all, let's take a look at the commercial side of its business. Currently BP and Airbus contracts are responsible for 20 percent of the PLTR's revenue and some analyst think that such high-concentration is bad. However, they said the same think about PLTR's government work when the stock debuted. In short, they said that it is very worrying that PLTR generates such a high-percentage of its revenue from the U.S government and tried to convince investors to value PLTR not as a soft company, but as a defence contractor. I am glad that I did not listen to them at that time and bought the stock at 10 dollars, cuz my thinking was that if the U.S government values the PLTR's software so highly it is extremely likely that commercial businesess will do the same. Do you get where I am going? If Airbus and BP are paying the company more than 100 million dollars combined per year, then that means that PLTR's software is extremely efficient and if used right, could potentially safe customers hundreds of millions dollars of expenses or lost revenue. If you want more confirmation about how important the software could be for the business, have in mind that when partnering with the U.S Agency for Disease Control and Prevention, there are rumours that as early as January 2020 Palantir was able to build confidential models that showed the potential for a rapidly rising outbreak. Palantir then rushed in mid-February to recall staff from abroad and order them into a four-week quarantine. Now imagine if you knew about this as early as PLTR. March puts for the win.\n\nEven forgetting about the software and PLTR's growing revenue, let's take a look at some other factors that can't be measured by financial modelling. Currently PLTR is the only SaasS company in the world that is in talks to receive Impact Level 6 certification from the DoD. That means that PLTR will have access to classified information. Yeah, that is the kind of information that if you share with unauthorised personnel you go to prison for commiting treason against the state. Furthermore, the marine that participated in the operation of killing Bin Laden said in his book that PLTR soft. was instrumental in the sucess of the mission. To top it off , PLTR's lobbyist include figures like retired Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Terry Pau and ex- US State Secretary Condoleezza Rais and the new Director of National Intelligence in the Biden admin- Avril Haines is a former employee. Well, I think that we can say with great certainty that PLTR has become extremely important for the U.S government operations. If history has taught us anything, it is that if  the U.S government values something , it will not shy away from spending millions of taxpayers dollars to keep it afloat. But it as not only the U.S government. PLTR has won numerous contracts with government agencies of other countries like the British NHS and PLTR's head of operation in Israel- Hamutal Meridor, served as senior director of Verint, with deep ties to Unit 8200. Unit 8200  is an Israeli Intelligence Corps *unit* of the Israel Defense Forces responsible for collecting signal intelligence (SIGINT) and code decryption.\n\nIf you are still not sure about PLTR's importance maybe you would like to know more about who is behind the company. Peter Thiel is a cofounder and the current largest shareholder. Yeah, that is right-Peter fucking Thiel. This guy was a business associate with Elon Musk in Paypal, he was the first investor in Facebook and a mentor of Zuckerberg and is a close friend of Chamath. He also bankrupted Gawker, cuz they had the audacity to leak the news that he is homosexual. Many people believe that he is one of the most well-connected men in the world and it comes at no surprise that he is a member of The Bilderberg group ( conspiracy theorists believe that these guys control the world) . I forgot to mention that his nickname is King Midas, cuz everything that he touches turns to gold.\n\nPalantir's other cofounder and current Ceo- Alex Karp is also a pretty interesting guy to say the least. He is a juris doctor from Stanford University, and a doctorate in neoclassical social theory from Goethe-Universit\u00e4t, Frankfurt, Germany. He is also a regular participant in the Davos economic forum. Oh, he also actively practices Tai Chi and Quidong. Yes, this guy actually studied the blade, how could you not trust him?\n\nTo sum it up, I will use Alex Karp's own words: \u201cWe are going to deliver the world\u2019s best software with the world\u2019s most efficient way of delivering it. Investors will decide what that\u2019s worth to them. And I think you\u2019ll find in a number of years that there will be a consensus: Palantir is a truly special software company that is arguably the most important software company in the world.\u201d -Karp the day they went public\n\nPS: English is not my mother tongue and I wrote this piece in a rush, so please excuse me if there are any grammatical or spelling errors.",

Red flags abound.\n\n-Under new accounting, Tesla could recognize lease sale as regular revenue so long as the expected future fair market value (determined by Tesla) exceeded the guaranteed buyback price.\n\n\n-But looking closer at the description of these new leases, it seems tailor made to overestimate sales via financing agreemens (repos) with offshore entities. \n\n\n-Only problem is that cars depreciate. In a repo, you pay a higher price at the end of the term than you receive in initially, therefore any sales would have to be written off as the counterparty's \"put\" is int he money - indeed Tesla 1Q2019 wrote off $500M in sales.\n\n\n-To fix this problem, in 2Q2019 Elon and Tesla make the claim that the Model 3 is an \"Appreciating Asset\" based on its potential future FSD capabilities, providing public corroboration to underpin its accounting claim it was about to make\n\n\n-Setting the stage for Robotaxi Repo. By claiming the Model 3s were appreciating asset, they could recognize 100% of revenue for their excess production, without recognizing any offsetting liability or write downs as the estimated future value would exceed the buyback price.\n\n\n-Beginning in 2Q2019 Tesla \"Other\" international revenue mysteriously exploded, as its inventory dramatically shrank. From 2Q-4Q2019 these sales represented 36% of total Tesla revenue. Tesla stopped breaking out this category in 2020.\n\n\n-We estimate $2.5bn of Robotaxi repos took place over three quarters in 2019. Operating cash flow ex. this amount was negative. FCF was -$2.5bn vs $0.0bn as reported. This could have included up to about 100k cars or likely 10%-30% of 2019 deliveries depending on sales price.\n\n\n-All Teslas key metrics rebounded substantially from 1Q2019 and have remained strong going forward.",

Autodesk's Role\n\n[Engaging with Industry 4.0](https://preview.redd.it/kz4g5qfd3zq61.png?width=3840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e45fab6fc951bf329cd89d8beccad8fe7504bb89)\n\n# TL;DR\n\nMeaningful, sustainable, long-term employment.\n\nThe current administration and Federal Reserve are continuing to progress in setting the stage for long-term investments in the American economy. In combination with the USMCA trade deal of 2020, the US will see 250B in investments over 8 years for infrastructure refactoring. We take a look at how Autodesk is a core benefactor of the economic models that govern these investments. I expect Autodesk to triple in size by 2024.\n\n[Autodesk Revenues](https://preview.redd.it/aj4qbyf05zq61.png?width=1276&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfff18884011a16bded7ba20d46e3772fad4a6fe)\n\n# Purpose\n\nTo be frank, I was surprised by the hunger for knowledge and I really enjoyed debating some of the rather brazen people here. WSB has grown and in my view, our committed analysts tend to run head-to-head with Wall Street analysts. We have on-the-ground experience as laborers, customers, and digital-natives that they often filter out of a privileged ignorance.\n\nPart of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation.\n\n\\- Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even rob-the-hood? **(Square DD Complete)**\n\n\\- How do we compare social media incentives? **(Pinterest DD Complete)**\n\n\\- What really is customer service? **(GameStop DD Complete)**\n\n\\- Are we familiar with new international trades that increase Mexican-Texan manufacturing? **(Kansas City Southern Rail DD Complete)**\n\n**-** What are elements behind US lagging industrial sector? **(You are here)**\n\n\\- Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio? *(Cloud Compute DD in Progress)*\n\n\\- Do we understand the consequences of STEAM education (Science, technology, engineering, arts, mathematics)? *(Roblox DD in Progress)*\n\n\\- How knowledgable are we of fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?\n\nAt the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m sharing my writing. I\u2019m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.\n\n# The Employment Problem\n\n&gt;The **Fourth Industrial Revolution** (or **Industry 4.0**) is the ongoing automation of traditional manufacturing and industrial practices, using modern smart technology. Large-scale machine-to-machine communication (M2M) and the internet of things (IoT) are integrated for increased automation, improved communication and self-monitoring, and production of smart machines that can analyze and diagnose issues without the need for human intervention.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A Skill Gap Problem](https://preview.redd.it/sbi6dmoy6zq61.png?width=711&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1cad0f9dc367ce723290f7ae65f97f702812041d)\n\nUltimately, the US is doing a pretty good job at maintaining  its engineering and architecture sectors, but there has been a glaring issue with a skill-gap that effects certain regions more than others. This is largely due to the strained relationship between increase automation vs. difficulty of learning the new tools associated with automation. People get left behind, especially when employment is lost in one factory and a worker is left to join another manufacturer with different standards, machines, or tools. In a nutshell, the barrier to entry for sustainable employment in the industrial sector has gone up in almost every facet.\n\nTools like Autodesk sit at the heart of these kinds of problems, where being able to understand and utilize a tool like Autodesk will dramatically increase your ability to get hired. In the information age, skills associated with Autodesk are ultimately as valuable as learning how to code in software or knowing the value of legislation and finance in other white-collar sectors. Autodesk lags behind these competitive sectors because the nature of industry it exists in with high capital expenditures. \n\nThe problem is a bottleneck problem, and solving the bottleneck will produce a far leaner and more efficient pipeline for industrial productivity, employment, and societal satisfaction.\n\n*Processing img kvm8z2md8zq61...*\n\n# The Education Solution\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ly24pppuezq61.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ab25ce2945104acb0f3c4d3816cb713db1af238\n\nThe reality here is that the education sector is also a slow-mover where shortcuts carry heavy competitive consequences. Another big element in this process is that high-level skills are ultimately dependent on adoption and communication demands. We need adaptable engineers to be familiar with a fundamental skill set that speak similar \"languages\". Autodesk has generally positioned itself to be one of those tools in a similar way that organizations like Adobe has positioned itself.\n\nWhat I believe will happen is that the incentive of certifications and accelerated programs will increase dramatically as a way to boost lucrative employment and adoption of skills. These training programs will effectively become tickets initiate a good career.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mj3rk4a2gzq61.png?width=2528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bde08f5487ed3afdd3a760fc1b3d7a019eb89ca6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xib18z21hzq61.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bb74a3b31dda0b750b0cb19fdfc4f97a2a4515b\n\n# AutoDesk's Role\n\nAutoDesk targets the EAC sector (engineering, architecture, and construction), so it helps to think about AutoDesk as software that can handle large scale developments focusing on the nature of smaller designs like intricate screws or cars. There is a lot of work that must be completed, with a strong societal demand. This can range from multi-year developments of hospital building in rural areas, or the construction of off-shore windmill farms. This inevitably creates a powerful compounding effect with employment and Autodesk's subscription model and increasing mobile capacities.  \n\n\n\\- As employment increases, subscriptions begin to increase.\n\n\\- As subscription increases, projects of scale are adopted.\n\n\\- As projects of scale increase, employment increases.\n\n\\- As employment increases, the length of subscription increases.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vk4hin3cozq61.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b569a74582ac2699904727002ae3663f530a95c7\n\nThe following is a list of Autodesk's relationship with various opportunities in the near and longterm.\n\n\\- **LEED architecture certification in civil sectors with Autodesk's architecture platform, Revit.** \n\n&gt;**Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design** (**LEED**) is a green building certification program used worldwide.

The response I received was amazing and lot of you were asking for weekly updates. So here goes!\n\n**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tkhtpy8hq6r61.png?width=623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cde4524f9c0f45d083d6370cce81e462640a965c\n\nGameStop continues to be the top discussed stock with more than 27K mentions. AMC dropped from 2nd to 4th position. PLTR gained in mentions and was the second most discussed stock last week due to a long-term deal they won with the U.S Department of Energy which is potentially worth 89 million dollars. ViacomCBS also made it into the top 10 but not in a good way. The company has lost 50% of valuation in the last 2 weeks and the sentiment reflects that. Rest all the companies are regulars in the top 10 list!\n\n**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/brep8x8qq6r61.png?width=623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47be46b91c1230ab01f618066a0344277613d285\n\nAbove is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.\n\n**ViacomCBS($VIAC)** was the company with the most growth in mentions. But, the average sentiment across the mentions was negative given the 50% drop in valuation. The stock had crossed the $100 mark on 22nd March 2021 and has lost more than 50% of its value since then. The market had been over-enthusiastic about the stock since the beginning of 2021 due to its effort of transforming to a streaming giant from a traditional cable media company. However, this enthusiasm was short-lived. There might be some scope for a short-term rebound.\n\n**ASO** was also growing in mentions due to their stellar earnings report. The company reported\n\n* Revenues were US$5.7b, approximately in line with what analysts expected.\n* (EPS) crushed expectations, coming in at US$3.79, an impressive 41% ahead of estimates.\n\n**Humanigen(HGEN)** reported phase 3 results of Lenzilumab\u2122 stating it improves survival without the need for mechanical ventilation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The stock jumped 100% on Monday and has stabilized at around 34% increase from last week. \n\n**MicroVision(MVIS)** stock soared 50% on Wednesday. This is mainly due to Microsoft receiving a U.S. Army contract for augmented reality headsets. (It's estimated to be worth $21.9B over the next 10 years). There has been a lot of rumors stating Microsoft is planning to buy MicroVision which predominantly drove the discussions on MVIS.\n\n**FUBO** stock price has been on a continuous decline for the last 2 months (more than 50% drop) and there is now increasing chatter on whether it is oversold or on the path to a rebound \n\n**SOME FAQ\u2019s:**\n\nHow does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).\n\nWhat is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyze financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments\n\n*Disclaimer : I am not a financial advisor!*",

Only about half the current team came to ARK with a history of full-time work.\n\n\\- Wood assembles the portfolio one stock at a time, using each stock\u2019s cumulative scores as a guide to position sizing. But these scores say nothing of each stock\u2019s sources of risk and return, which may be highly and undesirably correlated to one another.\n\n\\- The portfolio has become less liquid and more vulnerable to severe losses as its size has swelled. In the 12 months ended February 2021, the ETF\u2019s assets under management grew more than tenfold to over $23 billion. It has retained and grown its stakes in small companies that are now much more difficult to sell without [materially impacting](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1027682) their stock prices. Across all U.S.-domiciled funds, the ETF stood out in February for having the most concentration in companies in which it owned 10% or more of floating shares--that doesn\u2019t even include additional vehicles tied to the strategy, which combined amount to another $15 billion.\n\n\\- Without risk-management professionals to stress-test the portfolio\u2019s risk exposures, estimate its potential losses during historical or hypothetical market environments, and gauge worst-case scenarios, the team is poorly positioned to prepare and react.\n\n\\-To mitigate market-impact costs, ARK must build new positions more slowly and exit gradually. But its bullish or bearish signals are available for all to see--as an ETF, the strategy must disclose its portfolios to the market each day--and traders can respond either by buying up a stock\u2019s known supply (putting upward pressure on its price) or selling it (downward pressure) before ARK has offloaded its own position.",

        "selftext": "The details of the Biden infrastructure plan are now out and let's just say that it is a huge disappointment. We were hoping for unbridled spending instead we get one time, highly precise spending items and a reversal of the Trump tax plan and then some more...\n\nThe reconciliation was meant to allow the dems to spend without any concession of tax increases but it seems that progressive dems want to raise taxes...for the purpose of raising taxes. The sellside is only starting to catch up to this reality.\n\nFirst here is a summary of the tax initiatives by GS:\n\n**A 28% corporate rate**: President Biden proposed this during the presidential campaign. Each percentage point of corporate tax rate increase raises a little over $100bn over ten years in tax revenue, so this proposal would raise between $700-800bn/10 years. *We think Congress can raise the rate to 24-25%, but might start to run into resistance among centrist Democrats between 26% and 28%.\\**\n\n**Tightening GILTI**: Similar to the Biden campaign proposal, the White House proposes to raise the effective tax rate on Global Intangible Low Tax Income (GILTI) to 21% from an effective rate of 10.5% today, move the system to a country-by-country basis that would keep companies from using tax credits from high tax jurisdictions to offset GILTI earnings in low tax jurisdictions, and rescind the policy that applies the tax to income only above a 10% return on physical capital. This would mean that the GILTI regime would apply to most companies with foreign income rather than just to IP-intensive industries like healthcare and technology, and would likely also raise taxes for companies that currently have little to no GILTI exposure. The Tax Policy Center estimated the campaign proposal would raise $442bn over ten years.\n\n**Other international tax changes** The White House release appears to contemplate replacing the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT), saying that it would replace \u201can ineffective provision in the 2017 tax law that tried to stop foreign corporations from stripping profits out of the United States.\u201d It also proposes to eliminate Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII), which encouraged US-based companies to hold their IP in the US by setting an effective tax rate on that income similar to the effective tax rate on IP held abroad and taxed through the GILTI regime.\n\n**A minimum tax on book income** The proposal would also establish a 15% minimum tax on corporate book income reported to investors, which would serve as a check against companies that report large profits to shareholders but no profits to the IRS. The campaign proposal would have applied this globally on a country-by-country basis, but the White House release indicates only that it would apply this only to \u201cthe very largest corporations.\u201d\n\n**New restrictions on inversion**s The White House does not define what this would be, but inversions are likely to play a larger role in tax policy if the rest of the proposal were to pass, as the US would then have a high tax on the foreign earnings of multinationals compared with most other developed countries that rely on mainly\n\nterritorial tax systems.\n\n==============================================\n\nGS Estimates a 9% hit on EPS\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q7ow3gjfujq61.png?width=740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8f975ac24b51f5a267719f2b32163fc49168bf4\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y5ag5dhgujq61.png?width=740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb110ba1a3f932b9260ad331939d5cd590bab722\n\nBAML Estimates a 7% hit to EPS 2022 (currently consensus at 200$\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g4whch0hujq61.png?width=740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a088bffcffb6a4595c138380aa8fd82482f96783\n\n**Ed Yardeni**, chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research, wrote this week that Biden's proposed 28% corporate tax rate, if implemented, \"would reduce S&amp;P 500 earnings per share by $15, to $200 in 2022.\"\n\nThat 7% haircut is likely more than Wall Street has been pricing in. **UBS** equity strategist Keith Parker wrote on March 9 that he anticipates a 3.6% hit to EPS from Biden's tax plan.\n\nParker wrote that hiking the tax rate on long-term capital gains from **20% to 39.6% could slice 1.5 points off the S&amp;P 500 P/E multiple,** potentially another 7% hit. UBS expects that not quite half that tax hike will become law.\n\n==============================================\n\nThe only reason the sellside isn't outright bearish yet is because they seem to think that only a watered down version of this bill will pass. that's not true. via reconciliation what Biden wishes is what happens there is only one limiting swing vote in practice and that is senator Joe Manchin. Guess what the man is fine with a tax hike of A*T LEAST 25% so he LOVES THIS:*\n\n&gt;While he didn't predict a price tag, Manchin said Congress should do \"everything we possibly can\" to pay for it. He said there should be \"tax adjustments\" to former President Donald Trump\u2019s 2017 tax law to boost revenues, including by raising the corporate rate from the current 21 percent to at least 25 percent.\n\n[https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/manchin-calls-enormous-infrastructure-package-paid-new-taxes-n1261949](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/manchin-calls-enormous-infrastructure-package-paid-new-taxes-n1261949)\n\n## So for now i definitely don't see how the market can get away with pricing NONE OF THIS. BUY PUTS.\n\nMoving on to other asset classes which will explain why I only anticipate a drawdown of 5% :\n\nthe phasing of the plan is problematic in that infra plans tend to take a long time to start hitting GDP while the taxes hit will be immediate hence it will reduce 2022 GDP growth. Without writting a whole article about the situation at the FED, the market is currently pricing a full hike in 2022 DEC. That is the most insane thing this market has ever done since GME. IT IS NOT HAPPENING.\n\n## BUY ED DEC 2022\n\nand the pricing out of these hikes that are not happening will help with NQ's valuation and compensate for a point or half a point of P/E hence the 5% figure.\n\nTLDR\n\n**SHORT USDJPY, USDCHF, USDGBP**\n\n**LONG GLD, QQQ vs DIA, TLT**\n\n**BUY SPX OTM PUTS**",

        "selftext": "How is this possible? Many of you are probably thinking that I have a way to predict the earnings reaction or perhaps I am selling an options straddle into the number to capture a collapse in IV. That is not the case\u2026 at all. I never hold a position over a binary event. The earnings could beat and the stock drops or the earnings could miss and the stock rallies. We do not know the number or the reaction. I have a much better method and it is pretty easy to learn.\n\nToday is April 3, 2021 and earnings season is at our doorstep. I look for historical trends and I focus on stocks that have rallied into the earnings announcement more than 75% of the time during the last 12 quarters (3 years). I could go back farther than that, but I find my sample of 12 to be statistically relevant and I want to stay fairly current. This seasonal trend provides a huge statistical edge, but I don\u2019t stop there.\n\nI use a search called Pre-Earnings Bull. All of the stocks in this list have a rallied into the earnings announcement once they are inside of the 2 week window and they have done so 9 times or more in the last 12 quarters. I want to sell out of the money bullish put spreads on these stocks to; distance myself from the action, take advantage of time decay and to take advantage of the seasonal trend in the stock as the earnings announcement approaches. The stock can move a touch lower, it can sit right where it is or it can move higher. I just do not want a big drop so I pick stocks with stable price action.\n\nI sell weekly options that expire before the earnings announcement. Remember I do not hold over the number so I do not want to be forced to buy the spread back. This is a very important point. When I sell options I always want them to expire before the earnings announcement because they lose their value quickly and they will expire before the event. When I buy options for longer term swing trades I always make sure that they span the earnings release date because they hold their value well.  \n\nIn the Pre-Earnings Bull search below I am going to select an earnings release date that is more than 2 expirations away (April 19), but not more than 5 weeks away (May 3). I want to have some expiration dates to choose from, but I don\u2019t want the range of the last date to be too far out because then I lose some of the seasonality that I am looking to capture. Furthermore, I want to sell near term options to take advantage of accelerated time decay. During earnings season I want these positions to expire and then I want to move on to the next one.\n\nIn the search below you will also see that I am looking for excellent options liquidity and a value greater than -2 will suffice.\n\nIn the screen shot below you can see the candidates. I like to cast a wide net and then draw it in. I can select any of the variables in this search table to narrow the search or I can just click through the charts. Ultimately I am looking for a stable stock with strong technical support that has NOT shot higher. The technical support could be horizontal support, a trend line or a major moving average. Stocks that are moving higher pose more risk and that is why I avoid them for this strategy. Those stocks might already be on the move ahead of earnings and I do not want to risk a pullback. I need close technical support because that will provide my position with another level of protection and we know that buyers are interested at that price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Custom Search](https://preview.redd.it/fw7fbh5wvyq61.png?width=857&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f296d9159b6e5f5a05f1b0b7621f3c832ebc16c9)\n\nThere were many good candidates in the list, but I will focus on a good chart and a bad one. First let\u2019s look at one that does not fit my criteria. MMM has run to hard. That leaves it vulnerable to profit taking and perhaps it is already making its earnings move. The support levels are too far away and a bullish put spread at those levels would not yield a decent credit. I need a stock that has not run hard. Remember, statistically the stock can be dead flat and I can sell an ATM option knowing that the stock has a tendency to rally into earnings. Selling an at the money spread would yield a nice credit, but it would not give me much breathing room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[MMM Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/ialc1my1wyq61.png?width=911&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2dec121504cacd0250c095c3db3e6038fcf74416)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMGM was a stock that I liked in the search. It has horizontal support and it announces earnings on April 29th. The horizontal breakout after the last earnings report is represented by the \u201cA\u201d on the chart (A = reported after the close) and the stock rallied on the news. That price level of $37 is technical support. We can also see that the 50-day MA is at $36, providing us with additional support.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[MGM Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/6g60vau6wyq61.png?width=873&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6444018d74f9b5b427da12d3429e1f891f327b21)\n\nI want to sell the options below that technical support because I know that buyers are interested at that level. If the market falters, that support could be tested. So for this trade I will sell the MGM April (23) $36 puts and I will buy the April (23) $35 puts for a $.15 credit. There is $1.00 between the strike prices and that minus my credit is my margin requirement and my maximum risk ($1.00 - $.15 = $.85). If the spread expires worthless I will make $.15/.85 or 17.6% in 3 weeks. If the stock drifts below the strike price and it is just normal price movement, I will let it float in and out of the money with the expectation that as it gets closer to the earnings release the bid will grow. As long as the options have some time premium I do not have assignment risk. A close below the second support level in the chart would prompt me to close the trade. You will also notice that this options spread is 2 standard deviations (red dotted lines) from the current price which also increases my probability of success to 95%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img u2q7d8zawyq61...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuccessful trading requires an edge. In this instance I am taking advantage of a seasonal tendency and I am taking advantage of accelerated time premium decay. I am also taking advantage of the distance the stock would have to travel (2 standard deviations) for this trade to be in trouble and I am leaning on technical support that should attract buyers (horizontal support and the 50-day MA). The more checkboxes you mark, the higher your odds of success.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\n1. If you do not know how to sell bullish put spreads\u2026 do not sell bullish put spreads. This is a very consistent strategy and you should learn it. You can learn the strategy for free on the Options Industry Council\u2019s (OIC) website.\n2. Could I buy the stock or do a short term overnight swing trade with options as the earnings date draws closer \u2013 yes.\n3. During the trade I want the market to remain stable. If the SPY starts breaking technical support I have to consider closing this trade and all other bullish trades. Never take your eye off of the market.\n4. When you sell options premium make sure that the expiration date is before the earnings announcement date. The options will hold a lot of IV if they span earnings and this will decrease your profitability. If you are buying options make sure the options expiration spans earnings. You want that IV to hold up.\n5. This article is for educational purposes only.\n6. If you would like to learn more about the scanner please private message me.\n\nTrade well.",

        "selftext": "OK ladies and gentleman - I did an analysis on some historical SPACS to get an understanding of typical cash burn acceleration pre DA. Here is the general finding- every single SPAC had a crazy acceleration in their Cash burn during the month when a DA is announced.  As you can see in Yellow, the average increase in DA quarter is nearly 1200% - this is unfairly skewed because of some SPACS that executed very quickly and didn't have very much historical spend in the prior quarters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, in the final column, I took the quarter pre DA (The column to the left of Green) and divided it by the prior quarter to see if there was any acceleration in the previous quarter. As you can see, there are 8 data points and of those 8, 6 of them showed an acceleration 2 quarters before the DA. So essentially we see fairly level spend, a steep acceleration of \\~357% and then on the quarter where a DA is announced, you see a historical spike of nearly 10x. I expect Q4 was the acceleration period for PSTH and Q1 is a continuation of that trend, with Q2 being the largest increase where we will see 10M+ spend in Q1. If we don't see a DA by the next 10Q then the 10Q will give us a good idea of the depth of the negotiations. I fully expect a DA in Q2. As you can see there is almost no acceleration in spend on these charts with exception to an outlier on GOEV, where it appears there was a lot of spend on DD then a deal fell through.\n\nIf PSTH goes past Q2 for a DA then it will be the only SPAC with 3x acceleration and no deal in the subsequent 180 days. This is my largest holding.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w0jpii2tp9r61.png?width=2304&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38541a951815508a9b7a86e1ca759b19761fabfe\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did a quick look at GSAH and ALTU and the acceleration in spend is also significant for these SPACS. I am going to use this method to read through the 10Q's on recently filed SPACS and see where there is steep accelerations.",

        "selftext": "Remember that there is no chip shortage. It's a chip demand. AMD is making more chips than they ever have in their history but demand is even greater than that. For an explanation, see this on youtube /watch?v=3A4yk-P5ukY So when AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su says that the chip shortage is a good thing for AMD, you can start to understand why. And also start to understand why AMD's stock can soar on earnings.\n\nThe news article on AMD increasing production in English is here:\n\n[https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-5000-desktop-cpu-supply-availability-better-this-quarter-increased-supply/](https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-5000-desktop-cpu-supply-availability-better-this-quarter-increased-supply/)\n\nThey're getting the information from Channel Gate, which is in Chinese. It says that AMD will increase chip supply by 20% in Q2 compared to Q1. Now, this is rumors so the market isn't making any moves based on it yet, but it's likely that this means AMD is increasing chip production by 20% in Q2 relative to Q1. This follows Dr. Lisa Su saying that they are working on ways of increasing production to meet demand in an interview with Cramer a few weeks ago. You can find that interview on youtube /watch?v=h5HiWsAzahc So the rumor is likely true here.\n\nBecause AMD is selling everything they make, the increase in production will translate directly into an increase in earnings. Therefor, I expect AMD to make the official announcement of the increase in production along side a revised earnings expectation for the year in the next earnings report. In this market, you can't just beat earnings, you have to increase earnings expectations going forward, and that's what I believe will happen with the increase in production.\n\nAnother, unrelated positive for the company is that, due to retailers jacking up prices on AMD products, AMD has started to sell more and more of their products directly from their own store, cutting out the middle man. [https://www.amd.com/en/direct-buy/us](https://www.amd.com/en/direct-buy/us) They're doing this to \"ensure gamers can get AMD products at MSRP\" But really it means AMD is making an extra 20% off each chip. Brilliant.\n\nI've been posting over the last month that I believe AMD is going to $120 and the jump will happen within the next 3 months. I still think this is true.\n\nMy AMD Positions: 550 shares, 55 calls spread from April 2021 to June 2022 at prices from $90 to $175",

        "selftext": "So I see a lot of people complain about RKT's price action - it looks like it's continuing its trend of trading sideways with an oscillation since its IPO, even with the large spike on Mar 2nd. However, I just want to remind everyone that we have not completed an oscillation cycle after the big spike. I will do a quick FFT analysis to get the frequency of oscillation and show that the 3rd week of April is the turning point. I will discuss the two outcomes: if RKT continues its oscillation (short term bullish), or if RKT wants to trade with a new regime (unclear outlook).\n\nRKT closing price since IPO:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img mx4pynq27vq61...*\n\nTaking the Fourier transform, and then fitting the low frequency peak with a Lorentzian:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ax7qu55d7vq61.png?width=846&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cd03ddb621dc581b6e2ac2e15d4e615f1846d8c\n\nWe get the following parameters:\n\ny0\t=25.305 \u00b1 2.89   \t\n\nA \t=0.012523 \u00b1 0.00457   \t\n\nx0\t=0.032551 \u00b1 0.00155   \t\n\nB \t=0.00015029 \u00b1 6.38e-05\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nx0 is the peak center, and a frequency of 0.032551 (1/trading days) translate to a period of 30 trading days. From the Mar 2nd spike, which is very well-defined, we get Apr 14th as the next point in the cycle.\n\nAs we look to be currently in the trough of a cycle, there are 2 possibilities:\n\n1. We continue the oscillation cycle, meaning that we will turn bullish over the course of the next week or 2. This can be caused by swing traders and technical traders anticipating the end of this cycle and turning it into a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n2. It's possible that others already consider the big spike to have broken the cycle and RKT doesn't continue trade with the oscillation. This can be both bearish and bullish, but at least we will trade in a new regime and people can stop complaining about how RKT is trading sideways.\n\nI personally think RKT will likely continue to trade with the oscillation, because the big spike happened to occur at the same time as the bullish part of the cycle, which would reinforce the oscillation. I think there needs to be a big piece of news at the trough of the cycle to break it.",

There\u2019s no way this stock should be this low with he good it\u2019s financials are and how good the housing market is going rn and will continue for at least another year. They just did a 700 million note offering that was supposed to available til April 7th but had already been bought up by the largest banks with J.P. Morgan buying the biggest percentage. This is very good for uwmc. Now another reason why the stock is trading low is because of shorts and no it will not have a short squeeze. Most of the daily volume from the last 2 weeks had been shorts. My theory is they are keeping the share price lower to get a bigger dividend bc it free money. The dividend pay date is April 6th. And most analysts have a price target above 10 but we all know analysts sacks of shit but on this one they are right for once.

        "selftext": "There seems to always be a big debate as to whether real estate or stock market is overall the better investment strategy. I\u2019m young so this is me wanting to speak discussion on this topic since I\u2019m interested in it.\n\nHow exactly is real estate investing much better than stock market investing? For example, if I were to put 50K down on a property and take out a mortgage, I might be cash flowing couple hundred bucks after everything is paid each month but if I were to simply invest in a dividend company like O Realty, I would get roughly the same in dividends each month without the hassle.\n\nAlso, the mortgage would be paying itself but it would take years to get it fully paid unless you put extra down right? Also what if a tenant doesn\u2019t want to pay or moves out? What happens?\n\nWould love to hear the thoughts of your real estate investors.",

        "selftext": "Thought it was appropriate to make a post on this, after seeing this poor guy [u/lusi\\_spagetti](https://www.reddit.com/user/lusi_spagetti/) [losing a lot of hard earned money by \"investing\" on penny stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/mjwe60/i_dont_even_know_anymore/).\n\nYou may know that, on average, mindlessly throwing cash at the [S&amp;P500 gives you an expected return of 10% a year](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042415/what-average-annual-return-sp-500.asp). Some years it may be 20%, sometimes you may get fucked by a tech bubble or a pandemic, but, overall if you leave your money there for a good 30 years, you'll find your 10k became a 100-150k. It's basically like playing at the casino, but you're lucky enough to be on the right side of the table: you will win and lose on single trades/years, but overall your expected return is positive. Just like playing the roulette, betting always on red, but if it goes on the 0s you still win.\n\nThis is generally due to the S&amp;P500 giving you exposure to the growth of the American economy (often the world economy, as these companies have sales/business worldwide). Hence, as long as tech/education/business improves the economic condition of the US, you can profit from it by just buying an S&amp;P500 ETF, and reliably grow your wealth.\n\nWith penny stocks, the opposite is true: [the average penny stock loses 27% a year, the median 37%](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4210286-lot-of-college-educated-people-are-losing-money-in-penny-stocks). Which basically means that by trading them, you are expected to lose money, in the long run. Makes you reflect on why institutional investor/hedgies don't touch them with a 10ft pole. A key reason is the quality of the companies you are investing in: companies with poor management, no valuable tech, unsustainable financials, etc. One may easily be tricked into thinking that buying penny stocks it's just like buying S&amp;P500/NASDAQ/DOW grade stuff, just at cheaper share price, and hence be exposed to the same growth due to the economy improving. But it's not: on average, you are buying a failing company, and you should expected to lose money from your investment. It's easy to think, with all the crazy gains posted (and much less crazy losses - shy bagholders), you could make a quick buck on pennies, but the reality is the exact opposite. Don't be fooled by the current inflated prices caused by [an avalanche of retail \"investors\" in the last couple of months](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/business/penny-stocks-trading.html).\n\nThis is of course unless you have an edge. So ask yourself: do you reasonably think you have an advantage over other market players? An edge can be things like:\n\n\\- spectacular DD skills\n\n\\- a trading strategy nobody/very few are adopting\n\n\\- anything leading you to make better-informed decision than other market players\n\nAn edge is not:\n\n\\- \"I learned technical analysis from -insert guru name-\" ([technical analysis is bs, per EMH - even just weak form](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032615/what-are-differences-between-weak-strong-and-semistrong-versions-efficient-market-hypothesis.asp#:~:text=Though%20the%20efficient%20market%20hypothesis%20theorizes%20the%20market%20is%20generally,technical%20analysis%20can%20aid%20investors), ask yourself why anyone would give away this ultra important edge)\n\n\\- \"I bought $WTF and made 1000% in a month\" (that's a black swan event - which is contemplated in the EMH)\n\n\\- \"I'm an insider for some well promoted P&amp;D schemes\" (... well technically it's an edge, and quite a serious one, but other than a positive return you should expect a visit from the SEC)\n\nSo, overall, yes, you can find undervalued opportunities while trading pennies, and make the millions. One may argue that, since there's a lot less DD going on with them, one could develop such fundamental analysis edge more easily. But, on average, you should expect to lose roughly 1/3\\~1/4 of your money every year. The more trades you make, the more likely you are to get to this. Also, it's worth noting that the edge you need to develop is more substantial than to generate alpha in big-boys trading, as you first need to overcome the negative 27% average.\n\n**If there was a penny stock index ETF (P&amp;D500?), I would short it. The expected return would be a mind bending - Warren Buffett beating 27% a year.**\n\nHappy Easter everyone!\n\ntl;dr: if you don't have an edge, the reasonable expectation is you'll get fucked",

        "selftext": "Let me begin by saying: I am retarded. I have been long on $GME since January 28, 2021. I have more than one share. I sell covered calls. I will continue to long $GME for the remainder of the year. I am not a financial advisor. This is not advice. This is only my observation.\n\nFor months, I have been saying the most likely outcome for $GME is a trading suspension and a settlement price. Why no one wants to listen to me, is beyond me. These squeezes happen with some regularity. \\*watches the downvotes pile up\\*\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltnc32/history\\_of\\_short\\_squeezes\\_and\\_corners/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltnc32/history_of_short_squeezes_and_corners/)\n\nPeople like to look at VW in 2008, but we have a more recent example with Dole (2013 - 2017). \\*WARNING PAYWALL\\* [https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-02-17/dole-food-had-too-many-shares](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-02-17/dole-food-had-too-many-shares)\n\n**TL:DR** *Dole was found to have too many shares. Dole went private in 2013. The stockholders sued DOLE and a decision was made by the courts in 2017. The government did not want to get involved, and gave the burden of sorting out the confusion to the brokers. Each broker had the authority to find a way to reconcile its own share liability. When DOLE went private, all of those old outstanding common stocks were now valueless.*\n\nMaybe you are thinking that DOLE in 2013 or 2017 is too old news to be applicable.\n\nOkay... may I present to you $GTII. This is a Nevada company that is actively trying to fuck the companies that shorted them. Many of us have never heard of it, and I am not sure why. The set up to $GTII is the same as $GME, more shares exists in the open market because of short selling. Now, here is where it gets interesting. Last Thursday, April 1, 2021 $GTII recalled shares to record ownership of a warrant. This is a counterstrategy a company can take when shorted. All short positions must cover by April 8 , 2021. All this talk about #NoDates is absolute bullshit. There are always hard dates, oftentimes, we just do not know what they are. Keep an eye on $GTII, its fate will likely be a precursor to $GMEs.\n\nFor those of you that can read and do a tiny bit of research, look at the last month of trading with $GTII.\n\nNow, let us talk about $GME and settlement price. Citadel just lawyered up with a new CLO (Chief Legal Officer) [https://www.complianceweek.com/grapevine/ex-cftc-chair-heath-tarbert-joins-citadel-as-chief-legal-officer/30222.article](https://www.complianceweek.com/grapevine/ex-cftc-chair-heath-tarbert-joins-citadel-as-chief-legal-officer/30222.article) Dood was the Government's commissioner for the CFTC, and knows all about rules and regs. What will be this guy's primary responsibility? For Citadel to not get F'd by $GME or any other short position. How do they do that? Suspending $GME trading and a settlement price. Why do I think that? DUH?!? Historical precedent. The most recent time it affected me was with Luckin Coffee last year (2020).\n\n\\#AlwaysExpectFuckery.\n\nI am not a Time Traveler like u/DeepFuckingValue. I cannot tell you the future. But I can tell you that I firmly believe $GME will be worth Chipotle levels by EOY ($1,420) and I will continue to hold shares and sell covered calls.\n\nHow is this applicable to the discussion, one may ask? If there are more shares owned than issued, we have a problem with reconciliation. Some of the shares that I, or you, may own are \"counterfeit.\" And we cannot know for certain which are which unless $GME recalls the shares. So how would #TeamShort cockblock this effort, and try to get in front of it? They themselves would request that $GME is temporarily halted so that an audit can occur. The exact same thing happen last year with Luckin Coffee.\n\nYou must believe that both $GME and #TeamShort know there is fuckery amidst. $GME can recall shares no sooner than the second week of April. \\*winks at DFV\\* If they do, $GME will skyrocket because #TeamShort will try and close out their positions. If #TeamShort is the first to act, they will try and tank the stock as hard as they can in one day, and the SEC will announce a suspension of trading AH because of a need for an audit. This would lock in a Settlement Price, and allow #TeamShort to close outstanding positions at market value. All these people saying $2M is the floor are more than likely holding counterfeit shares that never need to be purchased. \\*sees more downvotes\\*\n\nIf the issued shares in $GME are 70M +/- and there are 200M shares held, there only needs to be 130M shares \"reconciled\" at settlement price. A price that neither you nor I control. \\*more downvotes counted\\*\n\nBut [u/LEEJANDZ](https://www.reddit.com/u/LEEJANDZ/) who might control that price? Good thing you asked that, because that dood that Citadel just hired as their new CLO, well... his ex-coworkers (buddies), will be the ones to set it.\n\nIn summary, we are going to make money. If DFV did not sell at ATH, he must believe $GME will exceed that price on or before April 16. If $GME announces a share recall for voting, DFV will be 100% correct in his prediction (and confirms he is seriously a Time Traveler). If #TeamShort acts first, we have a greater likelihood that we will see a trading suspension and a settlement price.\n\nThis upcoming week, watch $GTII. In their case, trading was not halted. April 8 is a hard deadline for $GTII to count (reconcile) shares. We will know by then how many counterfeit $GTII shares are in the market by April 8. This little Nevada company got tired of being bullied and fought back in the biggest (for 2021) FUCK YOU (push back) to #TeamShort.\n\nI do not have, and have never had, a position or a prediction in $GTII. \n\nCitadel CEO, Kenneth Griffin, is not the only one to take a math class or two at Harvard. But I am sure, he did better than I have.\n\n\\#BeFirst #BeSmarter #OrCheat",

By 2023, they will bring in significantly more revenue from subscriptions to their cloud services  than from selling their actual flagship POCUS devices. [Skip to the Bull Case](#the-bull-case)\n   \n1. [Overview](#overview)\n2. [Competition](#competition)\n3. [The Bull Case](#the-bull-case)\n\t-  [SAAS](#this-is-a-saas-company-disguised-as-a-medical-device-company)\n\t- [Supply Chain](#supply-chain)\n\t- [Jonathan Rothberg](#jonathan-rothberg)\n\t- [ARKG / Aunt Cathie](#aunt-cathie-and-arkg)\n\t- [Pets](#pets)\n\t- [Developing Countries](#developing-countries)\n\t- [Technical Setup](#technical-setup)\n4. [The \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b Case  ](#the-bear-case)\n5. [Conclusion](#conclusion)\n6. [Positions](#positions)\n### Overview  \n[Butterfly Network](https://www.butterflynetwork.com/)  makes Point of Care Ultrasound (POCUS) devices and a cloud based ecosystem to back it.  \n     \nBFLY's flagship device is the [Butterfly iQ+](https://www.butterflynetwork.com/iq), a point-of-care ultrasound imaging device that connects to a smart phone or tablet.  From their website: \n\n&gt; the world\u2019s only single-probe, whole-body handheld device, powered by\n&gt; Ultrasound-on-Chip\u2122 technology\n  \n###  Ultrasound?  Isn't that the thing where you slather a bunch of jelly on a pregnant woman's belly and x-ray her unborn baby?  Who cares about that shit?  \n    \n Doctors do.  Doctors care about that shit.  And you can do a lot more than take pictures of your wife's boyfriend's unborn child.  \n\nWhat do doctors use ultrasounds for?  In short, they allow doctors to look inside their patients.  Doctors can use ultrasounds to diagnose conditions, including those in the heart, blood vessels, liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, bladder, uterus, ovaries, eyes, thyroid, and testicles.  \n  \nPoint of Care Ultrasound, or POCUS, is all about using sonography to diagnose problems wherever a patient is being treated, whether that's in a modern hospital, an ambulance, or a remote village.  \n   \nPOCUS has been touted, albeit probably hyperbolically, as the 'replacement for the stethoscope'. \n\n### Competition \n  \nA traditional Ultrasound machine, [looks like this](https://www.medcorpllc.com/product/philips-epiq-7/), and costs anywhere from $15,000 to over $100,000, and needs to be wheeled around on a cart.      \n  \nButterfly IQ+ costs $2000, is about the size of an electric razor, and works with an iPad or smartphone.  This is because of their patented 'Ultrasound on a Chip' technology.  \n  \n  \n\nThe image the IQ+ produces is not as high quality as a traditional ultrasound, but for many applications, super high resolution imagery is just not necessary to make accurate diagnosis.  It's not meant to be a total replacement for traditional sonography, more like a 21st century stethoscope.\n  \n\n    \n   Phillips, GE, and others have attempted (poorly) to enter the POCUS space.  They are all significantly more expensive and less feature rich:  \n   \n   [GE VScan $7900](https://canadiem.org/handheld-ultrasound-a-review-of-the-vscan/)  \n   [Phillip's Lumify $7000](https://www.aedsuperstore.com/lumify-ultrasound-system-philips-healthcare.html)  \n   [Clarius $4900](https://clarius.com/scanners/l15/l15-pricing/)    \n   [**Butterfly IQ+ $2000**](https://store.butterflynetwork.com/us/en/product/butterfly-iq/pro/)    \n \n  Butterfly is the only solution that covers linear, curved and phased mode with a single probe. GE offers a dual-probe-one-device solution that is not cost effective. Philips is even more ridiculous, you have to buy three probes to cover all the spectrum.  \n    \n Butterfly owns a stack of patents for their proprietary technology including 'Ultrasound on a Chip'  https://www.butterflynetwork.com/patents  \n   \n Butterfly Network has agreements in place with the majority of the largest 100 hospitals in the United States and is commercially available in more than 20 countries including the United States, Canada, greater Europe and Australia.\n\n\n    \n## The Bull Case: \n  \n### This is a SAAS company disguised as a medical device company  \n(**S**oftware **A**s **A** **S**ervice you fucking smoothbrain).\n  \n From Butterfly's March 29th earnings call:  \n &gt; Product revenues for the full year 2020 were $38.3 million, an increase of 53% from $25.1 million in 2019\n &gt; ....\n&gt; Subscription revenues were $7.9 million in 2020, growing 216% from\n&gt; $2.5 million in 2019. \n\n**Hold up. Did I hear that right?**\n**216% Year over year subscription revenues**.    \n**4x the growth of their device sales.**  \n  \nGiven that rate, software sales would basically catch up to hardware sales by 2022 and almost double them by 2023.  \n \n| Year| Device Revenue (53% YoY) | Subscription Revenue (216% YoY)\n| ----------- | ----------- |----\n| 2020 | 38.3m | 7.9m\n| 2021 | 58.6m | 25m\n| 2022 | 89.7m | 78.9m\n| 2023 | 137.2m | 249.3m\n  \nButterfly's software is seriously impressive, comprehensive, and ambitious.    \nhttps://www.butterflynetwork.com/enterprise  \n   \nWe're talking HIPAA compliant Document solutions / storage, Billing, Telemedicine, Workflows, Credentialing, Education, Fleet Management, Analytics, QA, etc.  \n\nThis is not an app thrown together to support a device.  This is an ecosystem.  \n\nWhile the iQ+ is an innovative, best in class product that is selling like hotcakes, BFLY's holders are actually going to get rich off that sweet, sweet subscription revenue.  \n\n### Supply Chain  \n\nWait a minute.. 'Ultrasound on a Chip'? As in 'Chip Shortage'?  \nHow are they going to continue to rapidly grow their subscription revenues if there is a crunch on production of their devices amidst a global chip shortage?  \n\nFrom their earnings call, during the Q&amp;A:  \n\n&gt; we have a very strong partnership with TSMC and that's both an\n&gt; engineering partnership that has been going for the last years. We've\n&gt; looked to develop the iQ+ as well as a manufacturing partnership. As\n&gt; part of that, we do have a committed supply agreement with them. And\n&gt; so, **we feel very confident, both in their ability to deliver the\n&gt; semiconductor wafers that we need for our current production, as well\n&gt; as to help us meet additional demand, should it materialize**. We think\n&gt; this partnership is a competitive strength and the availability of\n&gt; wafers in the midst of a global shortage is just one example of the\n&gt; value of that partnership.\n\nLooks like they're all set.  Can Phillips and GE say the same right now?\n\n### Jonathan Rothberg  \n  \nButterfly Network's founder and top shareholder also happens to be the dude who invented high-speed, \u201cNext-Gen\u201d DNA sequencing.  [Jonathan Rothberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Rothberg).  \n  \nThis guy is a certifiable genius.  He runs an incubator called [4Catelyzer](https://www.4catalyzer.com/) that has a focus on 'medicine, engineering, and machine learning', it looks like a bullpen of potential future Butterflies.  \n\nHe's also the founder of Quantum-Si which is going public via SPAC merger.\n  \n###  Aunt Cathie and ARKG\n    \n Alright, you knew it was coming.  We can't ignore the fact that ARK funds have been absolutely gobbling up BFLY since it went public via SPAC merger with LGVW.  \n   \n https://cathiesark.com/arkg-holdings-of-bfly  \n   \n ARKG has doubled its stake in BFLY in the past month.  \n \n\n \n\n[In this interview](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/02/17/arks-cathie-wood-on-deep-value-stocks.html) from Feb 17, Cathie talks about an upcoming 'valuation reset' and how ARK will consolidate into 'higher conviction' holdings.

        "selftext": "*\\[This was a response to another commenter that I felt like could generate some good discussion. As I will mention a couple of times below, I'm new to investing, so consider this me working through my ideas and please do not take it as financial advice or the absolute truth of things.\\]*\n\nSo - I don't really love the bull case \"Omg new paradigm, low interest rates, never bet against the USA!\", nor the bear case (predicted 20 of the last 5 recessions). TBH to me it just seems like nobody can ever truly know... imperfect information and what not.\n\nI'm totally new to investing, but I did get my degree in economics. The market is definitely running hot right now, but then again, we can kind of afford it at the moment with all the easy money - the Fed is printing money precisely so that markets are more liquid. This is expected. We're also not totally detached from the fundamentals like we were with the dot com bubble. I mean, MSFT at 32 P/E ratio makes sense taking into account future earnings. You could say it makes sense for most of the S+P.\n\nThe problem is that it has to stop at some point. I mean, future earnings could account for the kind of P/Es we have now, but when we start reaching into 40,50, 60... then you're really getting detached from any sort of fundamentals. The other thing to look at is how much leverage is being used. [Right now, it's a lot.](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/2021/03/17/margin-debt-and-the-market-up-another-1-9-in-february-continues-record-trend)\n\nBut again, that's to be expected because borrowing is so cheap right now. This is what the Fed wants. The Fed wants people to borrow, spend, invest, etc. Keep the wheels of the economy spinning.\n\nBut everything has limits. At some point the Fed has to pump the brakes on this. They say that's what they will do. But as unemployment is still high and inflation is still below target, they're not there yet.\n\nThat raises a couple of questions for me:\n\n1. Will they actually pump the brakes when its time? Or will they continue to keep interest rates low in order to monetize US debt? Low interest rates means it's easier for the US government to pay back its debt. In theory, the Fed is independent of the US government. I'm not much of a conspiracy theorist so I do believe the Fed will act independently to raise rates when the time is right. But it's still something we won't know for sure until they actually do it. And there's also a question of *when*. I'm worried that things get too far ahead of fundamentals... ie, the easy money becomes too easy and the Fed loses control of the ship before it is able to act.\n2. When they do start pumping the brakes, how will the markets react? It was actually the Bank of Japan trying to slowly put out the speculation fire (by raising rates) that caused the Japan asset bubble to crash, leading to the Lost Decade. There's a real concern, IMO, that the markets cannot sustain these valuations without the Fed's support. As soon as the Fed steps in, people might fear the party is over, panic sets in, and we crash.\n\nSo, what am I doing given all this uncertainty? I'm going for a middle-ground solution. I've got about half of my portfolio in a target retirement fund (various index funds) that I've been adding to for a few years, and I've got the other half in individual stocks that are either good, reliable businesses or very defensive stocks. Some are mining stocks in the event of inflation. I'm also holding some dry powder as well as some inflation protected bonds as another place to dump money that isn't cash.\n\nBasically I'm playing the middle ground. If things go well, I will be able to ride the momentum. Not as well as everybody who is 100% in VOO, or 100% in winning tech stocks if they do rally and continue to do so. But I'll still do decently.\n\nIf things go poorly, I'll lose more than someone who was 100% defensive or purely in cash, obviously. But I'll also do a whole lot better than anyone who was 100% VOO or 100% tech.\n\nI'm new to investing so take all of this with a grain of salt. Do your own research. But I think my econ degree, plus all of the research I've been doing the past 2 months or so, has given me some level of understanding of how things tend to work. I think my plan is appropriate given the uncertainty right now as well as my risk tolerance (which is not too high).",

        "selftext": "Lets rewind and revisit a detail that most have known but did not focus on about the VW squeeze.\n\nSo the story goes, porsche had bought 42.6% of ordinary VW shares prior to the squeeze. The market had already known that it owned 35% from previous disclosure. Then Porsche bought 31.5% of cash settled options that will turn into shares on expiry, pushing total ownership to 74.1%.\n\nThey had been buying secretly for months and the price of ordinary shares (with voting previledge) had doubled while preference shares that do not vote had dived. However there were no squeeze up to this point, just a smoothly increasing stock with short sellers and arbitragers continuously betting on the difference between preference and ordinary shares. And it had actually fallen significantly just prior to the final spike. \n\nImagine all that buying from Porsche and the stock actually fell... \n\nFor details see link. https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.ft.com/content/0a58b63a-4294-3e07-8390-c3aabef39a26\n\n_________________________________\nThen Porsch announced publicly it will own 74.1% on a sunday press release. And the squeeze was done 2 days later. The short volume was only 14% ish, nothing compared to GME. Price went from 200 to 1000, also not impressive by GME standards. \n__________________________________\n\nSo whats next for GME? Now everybody seems to be waiting for regulators and dtcc to do something to set off the squeeze. I have to break it to you, these same people have allowed this to go on for decades without lifting a finger. Thinking they are gonna magically come to the aid of apes is just plain retarded. \n\nThis is nothing but a poker game and for the squeeze to finally happen there must be a show hand. Somehow wsb must announce what the total retail position is. If it is publicly known retail owns 70/80/90/150% of GME, the game will end and to each player their pot. If that doesnt happen, all we will get is a slowly massaged movement by crooked funds, market makers and regulators obsessed with stability and completely willing to fuck over millions of people to get that hedge fund job when they leave the gov. \n\nWe need a position poll of retail holders.",

        "selftext": "President Biden just released his [infrastructure plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/).  For those who don't want to read that honestly massive document TLDR, they intend to have probably the largest infrastructure improvement initiative since the New Deal.  Now President Biden and Secretary of Transportation Buttigieg are both on record as massive train nerds, and what do trains need to work?  They need rails, what are rails made of?  Steel.  Steel is also going to be used to repair all the bridges across the country so they stop being such a safety risk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, what stocks are we talking about here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nObviously US Steel (Ticker $X) is going to see a large increase in demand.

Just like the other stocks they dipped a bit yesterday so buy the dip.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0qwisy6sjuq61.png?width=951&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a97858a1131f765e98384a2c71b1c72c57e645b1\n\nThere are a lot of other construction materials companies, but most of them are under 1 B market cap so I can't mention them here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions, I bought 20 shares of X on wednesday, also holding GME, UWMC, and RIDE.

        "selftext": "Was happy to see news this morning that Lordstown Motors had the first two beta truck come off the assembly line yesterday. I know I know -- SEC investigation -- yes I know one of their trucks burned to the ground in January on a test drive.\n\nBut i like the way they are doing the trucks.  They actually look like a truck -- compare it to the Cyber truck, and just looks alone it wins hands down.  I also think the hub motors will be the way for EV to go in the future.  The space a motor like Tesla uses can be dedicated to storage area or more battery space for longer distances.\n\nI'm slowly coming to face reality that EV will be what we drive in the next 10 to 15 years.  So I've been watching and reading on different companies.  I do have a few shares of Lordstown (38 shares -- please stop laughing at the small amount.)\n\nHopefully the remaining test trucks come off the line without a hitch, the testing of them goes off without a hitch, and production starts this fall.\n\n[https://electrek.co/2021/03/31/lordstown-motors-reveals-its-first-two-endurance-betas/](https://electrek.co/2021/03/31/lordstown-motors-reveals-its-first-two-endurance-betas/)",

        "selftext": "I tend to purchase deep in the money LEAPS as stock replacement. As you know, the spreads can be ridiculously large (sometimes more than 20%).\n\n\nI recently discovered that when doing a poor man's covered call (pmcc) and it gets assigned, rather than selling the call, my brokerage places  100 short sale stocks per contract into my portfolio and lets me keep the call.\n\nThe spread to buy to cover short stocks seems far less than the call option.\n\nIf I have a LEAP call that I no longer wish to hold, is it materially different to sell the call with a 20% spread loss or do a pmcc and have the call assigned and keep the long call with the shorted shorted shares? It seems like the latter is the same as liquidating but with no spread loss, plus I earn a premium from writing the call option in the pmcc.",

        "selftext": "Take it from someone who started investing this year and made mistakes and loss money. \n\nYou need to decide what your goals are and how high of a risk you wanna take. Do you want to follow stocks and ETFs that you have to actively manage and attempt to beat the market with or do you wanna put your money in weekly or monthly and watch it grow without having to do constant research? Note- while i consider VTI/ the boglehead method pretty low risk and care free one should still keep up with the market to know whats going on.\n\n1. Open webull \n\n2. Deposit any money you are ready to invest into VTI (US total market etf) until you know what your official investmsnt plan is and have adjusted that a few times. Mine has changed a lot. VTI is a relatively \"safe\" yet great returning etf. \n\n3. Go to the \"paper trading\" section of webull and start looking at stocks. Use these different sub reddits like stocks, stockmarket, etfs and boglehead to do research (note- other brokerages use paper trading but its what i used so its why i said webull). \n\n3a. Learn about what TRUE DD is. Not what W S B tells you. Yes some people here and other forums occasionally post solid DD but you need to know what EPS, PE, BVPS, ROE, Debt, etc. All mean and why they are important. Specifically PE is something ive learned to assess. Webull has some pretty great charts where you can look at the different EMAs. Until you know all of these things and know what the company actually does and how they make money/ will in the future the stock stays in your trading account. \n\n4. Find a stock you like. Add it to your paper trading account and watch it for 3-6 months. \n\n5. Assess it again. Did it drop? Why? Did it run up like crazy? Why? Find out why. Learn how to assess these movements.\n\n6. If and only if 3-6  months later you feel like this stock is a winner then move it to your actual trading account and buy in. (For those of you saying well thats 6 months of gains i just missed. No you are getting VTI gains plus if the stocks solid now itll be solid again in 6 months right? The goals a solid return not day trading 200% gains).\n\nPRO TIPS-\n\n-DO NOT FOMO SELL OR BUY STOCKS. I can not emphasize this enough. Ive bought in where things are gaining 5%/ hour and guess what? The stock within a week dropped back down to \"fill the gaps.\" I never believed that was a thing but ive watched it happen way too many times. About 99% of the time a stock i watchlisted shot up if i got it while going up within a  week it temporarily dropped back before rising again. \n\n-Do yourself a favor and avoid Wall s t r e e t b e t s \n\n-Never invest any money you arent willing to lose today. If you need the money soon (within a year in my opinion) and will need that full amount do not invest it. The market especially now is unpredictable. A lot of people lost a lot of money these last 2 months that they will either never get back or will be holding the bag they call it for years. \n\n- Contrary to popular belief... its okay to sell for a loss. This is a hard lesson and one many people will give you a hard time on saying \"BuY hIgH sElL lOw.\" Guess what? Sometimes we pick bad stocks/ etfs. Especially when you are new you will think you found the gold mind of a stock only for it to get bad news like the trial drug didnt get approved or they delayed production or loss a contract bid. Would you rather be down 20% and perhaps watch it keep going down more and hold that stock for years perhaps before it comes back up or would you rather accept the loss (which youll claim on taxes) and then reinvest in a solid company/ etf that will make that loss back faster. Of course this correction we were just in is an expection in someways because some companies will bounce back relatively quick but i forsee that there will be many people that bought in at all time highs who wont see a profit for a very long time. \n\n- In the same respect above you have to have discipline. Stocks dont only go up. You WILL have down days. Youll temporarily be in the red. This will be the pucker moment you decide if you regret buying that position or not. Be disciplined. \n\n-The same goes for being on top. There is absolutely nothing wrong with taking profits if your stock happens to have a huge run up (knowing youll pay capital gains tax though). \n\n- DO NOT USE MARGIN ACCOUNTS \n\n- Avoid option trading for at least a year till you understand what you are doing and can pick good stocks to buy options for. You can lose so much money so fast. \n\n- these subs can be amazing and they can be toxic. Some people give great advice and others dont. Whatever someone tells you dont take it as fact. They may tell you that AMD will double in 6 months buy buy buy. But its your money not theirs you could lose. \n\n- CNBC gets a lot of hate but Squak box, fast money and mad money on Spotify or watching it live has some really good insight to the market. But again they dont always give great advice. \n\n- you have to decide what your plan is and what stocks/ etfs/ risk fits your life style and plan. \n\n- people are scared of dividends for no reason. Unless you are investing millions upon millions of dollars ignoring solid stocks and ETFs which pay dividends to \"avoid unnecessary tax events\" is silly. If you dont believe me look at an ETF like SCHD. calculate the max amount youll ever get in that account. Divide by shares and multiply by dividend rate. Its not that much in end that you pay taxes on.\n\n- as much as we all wanna make 200% every month on every stock thats so unbelievably unrealistic. Look at some of the biggest ETFs like VT, VTI, SCHA, SCHB, VXUS, etc. And see their YOY returns. That your goal.\n\n\nMy advice/ quick tid bit/ plan\n\nI attempted to beat the market. I fomo'd into stocks and got burnt and loss money. I bought stocks at ATh cause every said stocks only go up. Thankfully my losses are minimal since i invested minimally my first year but i learned some hard lessons. I got humbled quick and ive realized i cant beat the market, i don't have the skill or time to do proper DD and watch the stocks 24/7 to assess whats happening and id rather park my money in a few ETFs and let it grow. Im not gonna gain 300% in a year but if i can gain 5-10% in a year it beats the heck outta what a savings account could ever give me.\n\nMy current 5 fund boglehead portfolio spin off... (which i plan to hold for a year before i rebalance... with the exception of increasing SCHD/ VXUS quicker than that and decreasing VTI to compensate). \n\nVTI- 70% \n\nVXUS- 10%\n\nSCHD- 10% \n\nQQQM- 7.5:\n\nQQQJ- 7.5%\n\nGood luck!",

        "selftext": "\n\nBlink Charging is a small cap American EV charging provider with a value of 1.45 billion. It has been rallying from a around $1 dollar to a yearly high of $64.00 but in the last couple months has dropped in value by almost half to $34.00 due to a rising short interest amongst hedge funds to around 41% making it one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the Nasdaq right now. Not sure what hedge funds are short but I feel there are a few reasons for this.\n\nThe main reason for this is that there are a number of other competitors that are making inroads in the market and that Blink is relatively small amount of market share at 8% at current. Chargepoint is the largest in the market. Although I feel that that what the hedge funds have overlooked is that there should be room for loads of companys in the EV charging industry. The sheer rate of growth in the EV market has driven this company up 1200% and that has potential to keep going. Blink has implemented a total of 15,760 charging stations and Apple has added all these stations to its Apple Maps which is massive for the company. We also should not underestimate the radical change to the global economy where clean energy is going to overtake traditional fossil fuels. America has a target I believe of 2035 for the phase out of fossil fuel transport while most of Europe has pledged to transform its economy to be carbon neutral by 2030 with EVs playing a major part in that shift. This indicates that there is huge upside for the company in the coming years.\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\nBelow I have highlighted a few of the fundamentals that are interesting and may look familar here including the current short interest (42%) and the current float 32 million. Thats around 20 million LESS than GME currently. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\nAlso I checked on iborrowdesk where there is currently 45,000 shorts available very similar to GME at the moment although the borrow fee can be as high as 80%?? \n\nHere is where I got these numbers from if people want to expand on this.\n\nhttps://www.highshortinterest.com/ \n\nhttps://iborrowdesk.com/report/CCGID\n\nHowever I do think that there is reason to claim the stock is undervalued regardless of what the squeeze potential may be if that sanario was to play out. What do you guys think I'm not a stock wizard by any means I'm just an Ape like you \ud83e\udda7\ud83e\udda7 all so it would be interesting to get your opinions. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e",

        "selftext": "\n\nBlink Charging (BLNK) is a small cap American EV charging provider with a value of 1.45 billion. It has been rallying from a around $1 dollar to a yearly high of $64.00 but in the last couple months has dropped in value by almost half to $34.00 due to a rising short interest amongst hedge funds to around 41% making it one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the Nasdaq right now. Not sure what hedge funds are short but I feel there are a few reasons for this.\n\nThe main reason for this is that there are a number of other competitors that are making inroads in the market and that BLNK is relatively small amount of market share at 8% at current. Chargepoint is the largest in the market. Although I feel that that what the hedge funds have overlooked is that there should be room for loads of companys in the EV charging industry. The sheer rate of growth in the EV market has driven this company up 1200% and that has potential to keep going. BLNK has implemented a total of 15,760 charging stations and Apple has added all these stations to its Apple Maps which is massive for the company. We also should not underestimate the radical change to the global economy where clean energy is going to overtake traditional fossil fuels. America has a target I believe of 2035 for the phase out of fossil fuel transport while most of Europe has pledged to transform its economy to be carbon neutral by 2030 with EVs playing a major part in that shift. This indicates that there is huge upside for the company in the coming years.\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\nBelow I have highlighted a few of the fundamentals that are interesting and may look familar here including the current short interest (42%) and the current float 32 million. Thats around 20 million LESS than GME currently. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\nAlso I checked on iborrowdesk where there is currently 45,000 shorts available very similar to GME at the moment although the borrow fee can be as high as 80%?? \n\nHere is where I got these numbers from if people want to expand on this.\n\nhttps://www.highshortinterest.com/ \n\nhttps://iborrowdesk.com/report/CCGID\n\nHowever I do think that there is reason to claim the stock is undervalued regardless of what the squeeze potential may be if that sanario was to play out. What do you guys think I'm not a stock wizard by any means I'm just an Ape like you \ud83e\udda7\ud83e\udda7 all so it would be interesting to get your opinions. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e",

        "selftext": "Thank you everybody for all the great advice yesterday. I am down to three questions now: Do they let you trade immediately with the funds from a sale like Robinhood does, or do you have to wait? Also, from what I read yesterday it sounds like TD does not do fractional trades. Is that correct? Finally, if Schwab is buying TD then wouldn't it make more sense to use Schwab instead if TD, or is TD better? Also open to other ideas, I really do not want to be switching around. I am hoping to settle on one broker and stick with them for the long term. I am leaning toward Fidelity at this point. BTW, I prefer to trade on my PC rather than my phone if that makes a difference, The advice from here has been great.",

        "selftext": "Paysafe has finally just gone public with a new Board of Directors, much less debt, lots more cash, new M&amp;A plans and a new ticker: PSFE During yesterday's ticker change, there were several reports of people having no access to their accounts and/or suddenly being faced with an abrupt change in margin requirements from 25% to 100%. Many suggest this was intentional manipulation to give institutions cheaper shares. Regardless, this may have created a good buying opportunity for us too. For those interested, here's some comprehensive DD.\n\nPaysafe is a unique combination of fintech, iGaming, sports betting and banking all rolled into one stock. Whether you like him or not, this is essentially why NBC\u2019s Jim Cramer recently said, \u201cThere is something about Paysafe that may be the ultimate stock for this moment.\u201d (video link below) Market analyst Steve Grasso says, \u201cIt\u2019s the most excited I\u2019ve been about a stock in a long time.\u201d Grasso, by the way, has repeated called for it to triple ($45-50). So why is that?\n\nPaysafe offers a scalable electronic payment platform used by Draftkings, Roblox, Spotify, eToro, Fortnight, Coinbase, Amazon, Twitch, EA, 888, ApplePay, Youtube, Visa, Microsoft, Xbox, Amelco, William Hill, Ceasar's, Betfair, Pokerstars, PayLease, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, bet365, Lotto among many others.\n\nPaysafe is ranked No. 2 globally in the digital wallet space with presence in 120 countries and No. 4 globally in integrated merchant processing.\n\nImportantly, Paysafe is the No. 1 global leader in iGaming eCash network (currently 36% of revenue) with 10-15X growth projected. US iGaming continues to be legalized state by state, growing revenue by 234% in just the last year. \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is enabled for digital currency (a type that shall not be mentioned in these parts) without having to go through fiat. It recently partnered with Coinbase to expand options in US and it just launched PaysafeCash in US. (Now in 40 currencies and 30 global markets enabling easier cross border payments.)\n\nPerhaps most central to this recent merger is Bill Foley, Fidelity\u2019s Chairman of the Board and now the Chairman of Paysafe, who has a proven track record for generating exponential synergistic inorganic growth. For example, in just the last five years, he grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). He also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion (36.4X) and he says, \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d\n\nOf their expansion plans Foley says, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else.\u201d \u201cI have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody. That\u2019s why I got so excited about Paysafe Group Holdings Limited as its position in iGaming is really second to none.\u201d \u201cWhether it\u2019s a lottery or slot machines or sportsbetting opening in a state, it\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate. We\u2019re focusing on gaming, particularly sportsbetting, in the United States as it becomes legal and we\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting.\u201d\n\nAlong with Bill Foley, Paysafe's newly announced Board of Directors includes a former Morgan Stanley CEO, a former Chairman of the American Gaming Association and CEO of MGM Resorts International, a legal and regulatory expert in the multi-jurisdictional online and retail gambling industries, the CEO of Dun &amp; Bradstreet and CEO of Black Knight, two senior Managing Directors from Blackstone and two senior Managing Directors from CVC,\n\nBetween the new Board of Directors, Bill Foley\u2019s proven expertise in rapid M&amp;A growth and Paysafe\u2019s massive market share and diverse assets, including the world\u2019s second largest digital wallet, $362 million in free cash flow, 30-35% margins (21% CAGR), a projected $100-110 billion in transactional volume and $1.5 billion revenue, it is inevitable that institutional investors will, by necessity, include PSFE in their portfolios.\n\nPaysafe\u2019s industry leading risk management and international regulatory expertise gives them an edge in spaces where competitors have hesitated like iGaming, sportsbetting, alternative currency trading as well as offering essential banking and ecommerce services to the \"unbanked\" (1.7 billion globally). Paysafe has a global platform with integrated cloud technology (Snowflake) allowing for easier migration of eCash, integration of payment methods and expansion into global banking as a service. Paysafe is so diversified that they've identified a $58 trillion TAM.\n\nFurther, major investment funds know that fintechs are the future. Fund manager Cathie Wood says, \u201cFintechs are going to, we believe, gut banks.\u201d Similarly, Jackie Reses, board member of the SF Federal Reserve and fmr Head of Square Capital, calls for fintech \u201ctaking over and revolutionizing banking\u201d representing \u201ca wholesale transition\u201d of a $16 trillion market cap.\n\nAnalyst Michael Del Grosso recently initiated coverage saying, \"We believe PSFE represents a relatively scarce asset within the payments industry given its unique business strategy, geographical footprint, and focus on the iGaming industry. Our forecasts imply revenue growth at the high-end of management's guidance and we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming. PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States.\"\n\nInvestors should be aware that there is are post-merger lockup periods before insiders can sell their shares: PIPE: = 176 days. Private Equity = 86 days (roughly 6 and 3 months respectively accounting for trading days and weekends). Something to be aware of but there are several signals that these parties aren't in any rush to sell. Eli Nagler, a Senior Managing Director at Blackstone, recently said: \u201cToday is a significant milestone for Paysafe and a testament to the excellent work of their world-class management team over several years. We believe Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a public company.\u201d Regarding Blackstone and CVC, who now have four senior managing directors on Paysafe\u2019s Board, Foley said, \u201cThey rolled a significant amount of their investment which is a confidence builder. They didn\u2019t take all their money off the table\u2026 All of these things put together really created the confidence among the investor base to invest in the PIPE and then support the stock.\u201d Also, the PIPE investors are primarily insurance companies known for long term hold strategies and they are closely associated with Bill Foley. As Foley recently said, \u201cHaving a large PIPE basically validates the transaction.\u2026 The companies that I\u2019m affiliated with actually invested roughly a billion dollars in the PIPE and forward purchase agreements so Paysafe was always a really protected asset, besides the fact that it\u2019s a great asset.\u201d\n\nBill Foley says Paysafe may be his \u201cbest investment ever.\u201d He says, \u201cIt\u2019s a fortress. It\u2019s got a moat.\u201d \u201cWe have a proven strategy of winning as new global markets open. And most importantly, we have unrivaled regulatory risk and technical expertise.\u201d\n\nAs an aside, even though, \u201cRoughly 75% of online gambling operators use Paysafe for processing payments\u201d many in the US haven\u2019t yet heard of it yet. Partially because much of its presence is in back-end processing. Through its several new partnerships (Coinbase, Microsoft Rentmoola), Paysafe is just now rolling out its offerings in the U.S. In Europe, where it is more commonly used, Trustpilot rates Paysafe as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars) with over 20,000 reviews, and Skrill (owned by Paysafe) 4/5 stars \u201cgreat\u201d with over 16,000 reviews, while competitor PayPal is rated \"poor\" only 1/5 stars with over 16,000 reviews. Further, Paysafe was winner of the American Gambling Awards\u2019 \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and owns Openbucks, Neteller and Skrill, 2019 winner \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for best consumer take up and most innovative technology with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d Also, Paysafe won \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d 2021 MPE Award and the gaming industry SAGSE award for \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n\nTo give a sense of their pace and progress, these are some of Paysafe\u2019s recent announcements that were made before going public and have not been factored into the current valuation:\n\nDec. 15 \u2014 Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US\n\nDec. 21 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform\n\nDec. 23 \u2014 Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft\n\nJan 11 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Colorado\u2019s BetWildwood\n\nFeb 1 \u2014 Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership\n\nFeb 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services\n\nFeb 18 \u2014 Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world\u2019s largest esports company\n\nFeb 23 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency\n\nFeb 25 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Austria\u2019s A1 esports League\n\nMar 1 \u2014 Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash\n\nMar 12 \u2014 Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\n\nMar 15 \u2014 Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet\n\nMar 16 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments\n\nMar 25 -- Paysafe\u2019s Skrill expands digital currency offering to US with Coinbase\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFortunately for shareholders, even before Foley\u2019s value creation play book is put into action, Paysafe is currently undervalued compared to sector peers.\n\nSince market analyst Steve Grasso continues to his repeat his calls for a triple ($45-50), I've looked more closely at EV / EBITDA, EV / Revenue and EV / Free cash flow multiples of sector peers, including PayPal, Nuvei, Repay, Shift 4, Adyen, Square, Affirm, Stripe, Chime and a few others, using cross-referenced data from Nasdaq, WSJ, Morningstar, Macrotrends, Yahoo Finance. The conservative average of those three multiples puts Paysafe\u2019s post-merger pro forma share value at around $46.52:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price using the average multiples from the full list of sector peers:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore realistic share prices, after eliminating all outliers with very high multiples:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage :$46.52\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: Unlike Paysafe, nearly half of these publicly traded fintechs still do not report positive cash flow. Also, these multiples reflect a collective 27% pull back from recent highs so interest rate risks have been somewhat factored in.\n\nAlso, Paysafe's CFO noted that their conservative 11% growth projection is tied to the general fintech market at large. They have deliberately excluded both M&amp;A plans that are apparently already underway and US iGaming growth that may potentially grow 10x or more over the next 5 years. Further, the above comps include fintechs with slower or similar growth while still commanding much higher multiples. For example, Shift4 reported only 4% y-o-y growth and GPN's growth projection is on par with Paysafe's.",

If you are cock sure about GME hitting $42069 then you don't need to read every goddamn comment on the daily GME thread or read every crayon laden TA post that tells you GME will moon on X date.

GME is shaping up to be a solid long term play regardless of the short squeeze potential. Quit needing constant reassurance, it makes us look unsure and insecure. \n\nTL;DR: Nobody knows when GME will moon. Quit circle jerking and wearing out your dopamine receptors.

        "selftext": "# Digihost Acquires 60 MW Power Plant Increasing Hashrate Capacity to 3 EH\n\nTORONTO, March 24, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Digihost Technology Inc. (\u201cDigihost\u201d or the \u201c**Company**\u201d) (TSXV: **DGHI**; OTCQB: **HSSHF**) is pleased to announce that the Company has signed a binding agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) for the purchase of a 60 MW power plant (\u201c**Digifactory1\u201d**) located in the State of New York, bringing the Company\u2019s total power capacity to approximately 102 MW. The Company\u2019s ability to generate its own power will significantly reduce electricity costs, the Company\u2019s largest operating expense for its cryptocurrency mining operations. It is estimated that with the acquisition of Digifactory1, the all-in cost of electricity will be reduced to under US$0.03 per kw/h.  \n\n\nTo the extent possible, the Company intends to source and utilize renewable natural gas for the operations of Digifactory1 and also engage in the practice of acquiring renewable energy certificates, all in line with the Company\u2019s objective to mitigate its carbon footprint. Digifactory1 will have the capacity to operate an additional 18,000 top tier Bitcoin miners, which if added to the existing fleet of 11,500 miners already in operation, would combine for a total Bitcoin mining capacity of approximately 400 Bitcoins per month as of today\u2019s mining difficulty factor. Additionally, the expanded capacity would allow for a potential increase to the existing hashrate of 190 PH to up to 3 EH. This substantial increase in both Bitcoin mining output capacity and hashrate would be the direct result of potentially adding up to 18,000 latest generation Bitcoin miners, versus the current operating mix of 11,500 older and newer version Bitcoin miners.\n\nUnder the terms of the Agreement, the Company will pay to the vendor cash consideration of US$3,500,000 and issue to the vendor 437,318 common shares of the Company with a deemed value of US$750,000 (US$1.72 per share).\n\nAlec Amar, the Company\u2019s President stated: \u201cWe are extremely excited to have achieved this milestone in the evolution of our Company. Vertical integration is a fundamental aspect of our business model, which will enable us to maximize Bitcoin mining efficiency and continuing to create sustainable value for our shareholders. The addition of Digifactory1 will further reduce the electricity costs of our already efficient operations, and will also provide additional capacity to operate a new fleet of top tier Bitcoin miners.\u201d\n\n[Source](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/03/24/2198342/0/en/Digihost-Acquires-60-MW-Power-Plant-Increasing-Hashrate-Capacity-to-3-EH.html)\n\n  \n\n# Digihost Acquires 700 S17+ 76TH Bitcoin Miners for Immediate Delivery\n\nTORONTO, March 29, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Digihost Technology Inc. (\u201cDigihost\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (TSXV: **DGHI**; OTCQB: **HSSHF**) is pleased to announce the acquisition of 700 Bitmain S17+ 76TH miners for a total purchase price of US$4.025 million, that would increase the Company\u2019s hashrate by 50PH, or approximately 20% in the second quarter of 2021. The Bitmain S17+ miners are scheduled for delivery in early April and will be deployed immediately.  \n\n\nThe addition of the 700 Bitmain S17+ miners, based on the current price of Bitcoin (\u201c**BTC**\u201d) and level of mining difficulty, would increase the Company\u2019s monthly mined BTC by approximately 9 BTC, which would translate to an additional US$400,000 of operating profit per month. The new miners will be installed at the Company\u2019s existing mining facility in Upstate New York.\n\nMichel Amar, the Company\u2019s CEO, stated: \u201cWe continue to aggressively pursue every new opportunity that aligns with our goal to expand operations through the strategic acquisition of Bitcoin miners and low-cost sources of clean energy. The acquisition and immediate deployment of these new miners is the first in, what we expect to be, many new acquisitions going forward. We are excited to implement our plan to utilize the expanded 3EH hashing capacity from our recently announced acquisition of a 60MW power plant (*press release: March 24, 2021*), where it is expected that the Company\u2019s energy cost would be further reduced by up to 40%.\u201d\n\n[Source](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/03/29/2200616/0/en/Digihost-Acquires-700-S17-76TH-Bitcoin-Miners-for-Immediate-Delivery.html)\n\n**About Digihost Technology Inc.**  \nDigihost Technology Inc.

        "selftext": "\n\n\n\nThis post is regarding the link on Michael Burry's Twitter. It is a long read, but I have found some parallels with [The EVERYTHING Short](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgucv2/the_everything_short/). Really recommend reading the whole thing it if you have time.\n\nRead it here: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/ins-and-outs-of-collateral-re-use-20181221.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/ins-and-outs-of-collateral-re-use-20181221.htm)\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This document was published in December 2018 and the author has a PhD in Finance, so a real wrinkly brain. (Although it is a bit outdated, the information is insightful and Michael Burry is leading us to it)\n\n**So what sticks out to me:**\n\n1. &amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/18s07nx4lhq61.jpg?width=294&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f86ce49c15ff2eccf34d031e0129ee09c42aae8\n\n2.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0jrlxae7nhq61.jpg?width=319&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b98e4ede6f06ef8562d6c039c5e138b88ace48b\n\nDid I read that right, 7 times as many treasury security backed assets as they own!?! and this is just 2018...\n\n3.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/522gn9j8nhq61.jpg?width=408&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f963eceba95828408aba0ce2391f43b738cdd3ed\n\nSo this part about the eSLR rule is interesting, but it didn't hold up. Next I will show some 2020 data from the same author which shows the collateral multiplier back up around 9 in April 2020.Source: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2020103pap.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2020103pap.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e8h5xnu1ohq61.png?width=697&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a334a1c4d758f5364a51f8f61362d7f6f271e74f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m3vkyi49ohq61.png?width=648&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5e2c2dab4e6145fcc80504ebf97585d100bfaaf\n\nNotice collateral multiplier is defined as the ratio between the black line (U.S. Treasury SFTs) and the red line (non-rehypothecated).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCould a much smarter ape like u/atobitt give some insight here? This looks huge, but I don't completely understand what I'm looking at here.\n\nSorry if it's a bit rushed, I wrote it during my lunch break. I'll respond to comments later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit 1: Great analysis from u/weeknddev \n\n&gt;7x leverage on encumbered capital and more than 85% is rehypothecated. This is like taking 85% of the same banana until there is no banana left. I would suspect that 7x exposure is low. Why?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Those who do not exceed 700b in capital only have to report monthly as of this publication. That means at any given time they could be several factors more rehypothecated betting like fucking degenerates. And like in other posts because their money comes from derivatives, they are able to sell them and make out like bandits. Truly bandits.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Since we effectively blocked their get out of jail free card by holding so damn hard they cannot come up with those rehypothecated shares. They are beyond fucked .. but we might be too.\n\nAll I can say is, buy and HODL is the way.\n\n**Important: Let\u2019s Spread Awareness**\n\nMy dear Apes check this out.\nLet\u2019s spread awareness of what an massive fraud is happening currently on the stock markets. What better way is there than than educating ourselves and others?\n\n\n**Not financial advice**\n\nThis is not financial advice. I\u2019m just an idiat who has no clue what he\u2019a taklking about. I just like the stock.\n\n**Original source** by u/RichHodler",

        "selftext": "I got in at $13 after reading of it on wallstreetbets but ended up selling it at around $17 because I thought it\u2019s amazing that something I got from wallstreetbets actually went up, time to take profit. I was a pussy basically. Then I saw it went up to $30s then $100s then $300s and as many I started reading more on it but decided not to chase it. Then saw it come back down to $40 but just thought to myself I dodged a bullet, even though I could have stayed in at $13 purchase and not sell but it could be worse and I could have gotten it and $300. Then I saw it going back up and while all of this was happening I went balls deep reading the DDs on wsb/gme and really understood what was going on but again decided to stay away cause I didn\u2019t want anything close to betting. But clearly it didn\u2019t stay that way and my whole plan changed when I took my mothers to doctors, we were sitting in the waiting area and I had some heart to heart with my mother (she recently lost her brother and got sick right after) She went to use the restroom and I opened wsb and saw DFV post his account update. That happened to be exactly at the time when $GME had gone back up from $40s back to above $100s, but that day it was red. It dipped below $100 and I set the limit for $88 to go all in and guess what $GME low was that day.. around $86.5. I got my shares and right after it started going up.\nAnd it was the last time $GME dipped below $100. I consider myself extremely lucky I got a good buy point even though I was nowhere in the earliest of people who deserve all the returns in this more then anyone cause they believed in the stock from the start but I am so glad I got in this cause at that moment it felt so right. It still feels right. This was about 40 days back and i have deleted my stock account from my phone so I don\u2019t even think of selling it, I want..need this to change my life around, had pretty much the worst time of my life since I lost everything in 2018 and this seemed like the best way to do it. I put whatever I have now In gme and honestly it doesn\u2019t matter if I got in at $88 or $200 when it\u2019s at +$10000. It\u2019s good to be in this journey with you guys. Thanks to you guys I got in this and got this opportunity to see the worth.

My vision is to increase my trading account by +80000% this year, going from 100 USD to 80k USD.\n\nI know it sounds insane, but I actually have a plan for this.\n\nAll the best,\n\nJoel",

However everytime the meeting is mentioned it just says \u201cmeeting will be held on..\u201d and then the sentence ends abruptly. Why wouldn\u2019t they specify a date? Is it just because they haven\u2019t decided when and where? \n\nIs it allowed to submit such filings with missing information? Maybe it\u2019s done in the interest of getting Ironsources financial information to the general public ASAP but I was just confused reading this. Can someone elaborate if this is normal practice?

The eps is around the same though. The beta for B is just under 1 at 0.97 whilst A and C are around 1.5\n\nSo why is there such dispersion between its class A and class B share price?
