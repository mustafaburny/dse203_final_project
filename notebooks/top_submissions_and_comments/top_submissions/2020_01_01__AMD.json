        "selftext": "I've been watching this site for forever and started trading in October with $5,000 and turned it into $40,000 trading earnings and Dis in Nov. It was awesome and I felt badass. \n\nAround Dec 1st I told my gf I would stop trading since I was having sleepless nights, stress headaches, and was somewhat obsessed with this shit. I had to get back in.... and that bad karma made me lose on almost every trade and added $30,000 of real money (to get above $25k) which I lost as well and am down currently $32,000 of real money in additions to all the gains from November. \n\nHere are some highlights: \n\nLulu earnings Dec 11th: I felt it would do well on earnings and lost $22,050 on a $25,000 yolo 10 minutes after purchasing. (My first big guh moment and I f'ing KNEW not to do this) \n\nNVDA Dec 23rd: Bought $25,000 of 1/10 calls that dipped 30 minutes after buying... got weak hands... and lost $13,384. (I bought at the ATH at the time and felt it would just keep going up) \n\nAMD Dec 26th: Bought $15,000 of AMD $50 calls at $47.10 (1/3 and 1/10)... dipped immediately after buying... got weak hands a couple days ago on Dec 30th... and sold around $45.80 for a $11,800 loss. Now I see that fucker is up around $49 today and figured it might since $50 seems doable next week. Fuck me and my shitty decisions... I knew I should have held until today with CES next week but Trump bombing Iraq got me twitchy and I just wanted out. (My $3k would be worth $18k if I would have stayed in one more day) \n\nThe highlight of November was selling my $28k of DIS fd's... 2 hours prior to the stock rocketing up once subscriber numbers were released. I took a $9,000 loss instead of a $150k+ gain. I still got in afterwards and it went up $40k.... which I held until it was a $12k gain and sold. (Selling 368 contracts 2 hours before subscriber numbers came out still makes my heart want to explode) \n\nWell that's my story. Not sure why I am posting but it kinda feels therapeutic in a way to let this shit out. I haven't told anyone since 1. Most my friends wouldn't understand 2. My gf would probably be pissed I lied to her. I have $3,200 left in my restricted from purchasing Robinhood account that I am transferring over to WeBull and the funds should be there in 2 days. I am thinking with earnings this month I can turn this $3,200 around with some smart purchases instead of yolo'ing stupidly. But maybe fucking not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n [https://imgur.com/gallery/4kVnfVS](https://imgur.com/gallery/4kVnfVS)",

        "selftext": "So I just recently started trading options, and like most noob retards I just bought calls and puts because everything else was too confusing and hard.  Credit spreads, iron condors, butterflies?  What the fuck does that mean?  Stock going up= Calls, stock going down= Puts.  I thought that was so simple and easy.  Turns out it was simple and easy except my win percentage was like 20%, and I was losing a bunch of money.  I started to get pissed off, but then I realized that if buying calls and puts only won like 20% of the time, then selling them must win 80% of the time.  So I switched strategies and looked into selling calls/puts.  I learned ( I know learning might be too difficult a concept for some of you retards) that selling calls/puts had a much higher probability of success, but also had basically unlimited loss potential if you're wrong.  Now since I'm a huge pussy and don't like unlimited losses, I learned about credit spreads, which not only have a massively high probability of winning, but also cap your losses at a certain amount.  These things literally CAN'T go tits up.  I'm now trading credit spreads and holy shit these things are literally free money.  Like just pick a number you know the stock isn't going to go past and sell that call/put. Then just buy a call/put and little further out of the money, just in case shit goes bad, and you get to keep all that juicy premium you collected when you sold.  FREE FUCKING MONEY.  Check it out.  AMD is a fucking bull train running harder than the train your friend's ran on your sister last night.  No way that shit drops below $47 again.  Sell the $47 put, buy the $45 because I'm a huge pussy and don't like unlimited losses, and the difference premium is all yours when the options expire, mine are 1/10s.  Free fucking money.  This shit is so easy.  I will trade nothing but credit spreads for the rest of my life.",

I've gotten a pretty solid understanding of the basic concepts of option trading, but I'm really trying to understand how to apply that in real-world application.\n\n\\*\\*AMD current price: $50.83\\*\\*\n\nBased on the extensive research I've done, AMD's gain has consistently defied both analyst and investor expectations over the past year. Every recent article seems to be nothing but good news about the company, from management hires to new technology and increased investor confidence. 2019 Q4 earnings are set to be reported on the Jan 28th - three days before this call expires - and EPS is estimated on Robinhood to be $0.31, which is $0.10 higher than Q3s actual.\n\nThe only piece of information I've found that makes me hesitate was a single sentence in an article from an analyst who gave AMD a hold rating, who said that their main bull run is over. However, it seems like anyone who has said that in the past year has been wrong.  \n\n\nSo, does this seem like a relatively good pick at this point? Why or why not? I know Delta and Theta aren't great, but are they bad enough to not buy this call?\n\n![img](vr3kspqpelb41)",

        "selftext": " Alright you Autist,\n\nMy first post on WSB, long live bull gang.\n\nLet\u2019s get to options trading using cool shit like MACD, RSI, and GAP so we can go all in and lose our money together, head to the \u201cWinchester, have a nice cold pint, and wait for 2020 to blow over.\u201d Note: I\u2019m not a pro or a financial advisor, use at your own risk. What I am is a 300lb neckbeard that loves the show Billions, cries at the end of Wolf of Wallstreet, and comments on Pornhub videos. But anyway\u2026I\u2019ll be using AMD due to the bull gang love and CGC cause some autist is giving out wrong info, don\u2019t buy that shit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**RSI:**\n\nDafuq is RSI? Well\u2026it stands for Relative Strength Index\u2026and Wikipedia says it\u2019s \u201ca momentum indicator that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock.\u201d For our purposes here, think of it as just one word, **Momentum**. We can look at the momentum of a stock based on specific criteria, 250 days and 10 days and select times to buy and sell contracts of said stock. This generally works on a 1day \u2013 5minute chart. I like to day trade options, scalp, take my tendies, hit up Wendy\u2019s\u2026dat baconator nawmean. *Find what works best for your trading style*.\n\n\\*RSI | 250-day Indicator\\*\n\nThink of this as the \u201coverall\u201d momentum of the stock.  RSI is used for overbought/oversold positions and floats between 30-70. For our trading, think of 50 as our indicator line. Anything above is a \u201cbullish\u201d stock and anything below is a \u201cbearish\u201d stock.\n\nBullish: AMD \u2013  [https://imgur.com/a/sbTXDb7](https://imgur.com/a/sbTXDb7) \n\nBearshit: CGC \u2013 [https://imgur.com/a/nI2BTpd](https://imgur.com/a/nI2BTpd) \n\nThis shows the long-term trend of the stock, rather it\u2019s on fire or crashing like Pier 1 imports. As you can see AMD is bullish and well, I will repeat don\u2019t by that shit CGC yet options wise (until it hits the below stuff, the call the fuck out of it).\n\n\\*RSI | 10-day Indicator\\*\n\nThe 10-day chart shows your entry and exist points (look to call / look to put) for potentially gaining max profit.\n\nSimilar to the 50 line for the 250-day indicator, we\u2019re looking at the 30 and 60 lines for the 10-day chart.\n\nTreasure Map: AMD - [https://imgur.com/a/K12HIkG](https://imgur.com/a/K12HIkG) \n\nAs you can see, usually charts come around after the 30 and 6 levels. So for buying calls, watch for the stock to drop below 30 and then place a put on the loop-around back once it crosses 30 again. Ride it up as long as you want, but once it crosses 60, I sell the option, rather ITM, ATM, or OTM.\n\nSame for puts, but inverse, put at the 2nd 60 line , exist at the first 30 line break.\n\nHopefully you\u2019ll profit. I even added in some puts to show the bear gang some luv. &lt;3 fap n nap\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MACD:**\n\nNow that you\u2019re an expert options ~~trader~~ autist at RSI, let\u2019s move to MACD\u2026I like to call it the MacDaddy. But really, MACD stands for Moving Average Convergence Divergence and it\u2019s a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security's price. For our purposes, none of that shit matters, we\u2019re looking for X marks the spot on calls or puts.\n\nThis one is simple, use the 50 line as your baseline (similar to RSI 250) with 12 and 26 as your settings. Anytime the moving averages cross (make an X) above the 50 line, that\u2019s usually a sign to put, if below the 50 line, that\u2019s usually a call option.\n\nExample: [https://imgur.com/a/C9KdtDm](https://imgur.com/a/C9KdtDm) \n\nMake sure you review the chart overall, look at the amount of time it took to move $X amount. Based on your dollar movement estimate for either calls or puts, always multiple by 10. For example, if a stock is $11, and I put a call for $13, I wouldn\u2019t want to cut myself short, so I\u2019d get a call that\u2019s about 20 days out ($2 x 10 = 20) Jesus titty fucking Christ break out the calculator already and do your own math.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**GAP:** \n\nMy personal favorite and I\u2019m not talking about the GAP between my eyebrows either, thanks genetics. Fucking 2020 caveman over here. Anyway\u2026\n\nI like it cause it\u2019s easy and narrows down my choices for what to call or put. I look at stocks that gapped up or down and use the above RSI and MacDaddy to see if it\u2019s at a good entry point. If all 3 stars align, viola, you\u2019ll be driving a cybertruck in no time.\n\nExample GAP: [https://imgur.com/a/peLJBTk](https://imgur.com/a/peLJBTk) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Parting words of wisdom:**\n\n\\- It\u2019s a marathon, not a race\n\n\\- No one went broke locking in profits\n\n\\- Don\u2019t be greedy, build you stack once option at a time\n\n\\- F for the Bear gang\n\nLuv, \n\nFap-n-Nap",

ONLY 1 MAN, rest 4 are all women. are you telling me Asian women are better at semiconductor engineering than Asian men? once again, huge gynocentric bias. its almost certain that Asian guy is highly competent because he's subject to the same strict criteria as a \"normal\" white male applicant, while the 4 Asian women are most likely not and chosen because of their gender and being a minority (despite the fact that being an Asian man brings no advantage at all despite being a minority)\n\n\n&gt;Intel named to the NAFE Top 50 Companies for Executive Women.\nThe National Association for Female Executives (NAFE) list celebrates U.S. companies that have programs and policies in place that promote the advancement of women, including training, accountability and succession planning. This year marks the 6th time Intel has been recognized on NAFE\u2019s list of top companies for executive women. \n\nJFL at the blatant gender discrimination\n\nFor those who don't know, Intel has fucked up their CPU roadmap. It's been stuck at 14nm for 5 years and the 10nm process has been delayed again and again. And investors and gamers are not happy about it. \n\nTheir former CEO,  Brian Krzanich, was fired for failing to deliver 10nm. To avoid admitting Intel has screwed up their technology, the official reason for his firing was for him having relationship with a female coworker LOL talking about a fucking hypocrite (he wouldn't be fired for that reason or excuse, if he actually delivered the 10nm). and now a bean counter is the new CEO and been in charge. Under that cuck Brian Krzanich, Intel was focused on identify politics, promoting women and blacks, as well as other PC stuffs such as declaring their CPUs \"conflict minerals free\". \n\nAll the nerds on reddit know Intel's 10nm fuckup, how it stagnated CPU tech by keep releasing 4 core mainstream products for 10 years rather than giving out more cores,  and how it allowed its rival AMD to catch up. None of them know the real reason, they just think its greed. The real reasons are far worse. It's because of cuckoldry, pussy worship, and mangina-ism.",

        "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nSo I wrote 3 days ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eodce4/nflx_jun_18_423_peak_vs_tsla_today/) about how I expected $TSLA to peak soon and it looks like the very next day it did peak at $547.31. I wanted to offer a potential options play for y'all which I have been thinking about since that post (I originally said options looked to expensive, but that was dumb-ish). \n\nFirst of all we should ask ourselves, \"how far can Tesla fall?\". Below is an updated version of the original graphic I shared. \n\n![img](xfo95r0oo8b41 \"Climax tops: TSLA vs. NFLX. vs. AMD\")\n\nThis one compares Tesla's current climax top to both Netflix and AMD when they experienced similar moves. As you can see in the top row I have noted that NFLX experienced a decline of roughly 22% (this was generously excluding the Q4 2018 market crash which, if included, would have made for a \\~45% decline peak to trough), and AMD experienced a decline of 40% peak to trough. Based on these numbers we could expect TSLA to fall a similar amount of 20-50% - a stock range of $274 to $438. Also worth noting (although it's not on the graph) is that these declines typically played out over 30-60 days. \n\nBottom line: A 20%+ decline looks likely within the next 60 days. \n\nAs I said in the original post: the options are too expensive IMO to simply buy OTM puts. I would recommend a bear put spread instead over a $10 range. \n\nLet's assume the weakest decline of our range, 20% to $440 within 60 days, and design an options play for that to see potential risk:reward. \n\nLong $450 March '19 Puts @ 21.75 \n\nShort $440 March '19 Puts @ 17.75\n\nNet cost of $4.00 vs $10 payoff so 150% potential profit minimum if correct. You can bet on a steeper decline and your profit should improve dramatically.\n\nLet's assume a dramatic decline of 40% to $330, again within 60 days. \n\nLong $340 March '19 Puts @ 3.85\n\nShort $330 March '19 Puts @ 2.80 \n\nCost $1.85 vs $10 payoff, so 440%. Choose what risk/reward suits you.",

It\u2019s a pattern it has played out often and a throwback to when it was less competitive and kind of a dog.  \n\nThe difference here is that according to fundamentals, it shouldn\u2019t drop - at least not that much.  The future outlook is positive and surprisingly, even more so in the longer run.  So I think it\u2019s a good growth stock still and it should reach analyst estimates of $60 well before the next earnings call.  \n\nIt\u2019s always important to glance over at what Intel is doing when considering AMD.  Right now INTC is still mired in production issues. It\u2019s trying to pivot into cloud data center biz to offset their chip biz losing market share - and to their credit, are doing a good job of it.  But as far as AMD is concerned, that\u2019s fine and shows INTC is not doubling down to try to fix their long term issues in this market.\n\n I\u2019m staying long on AMD and once the flu and the irrational earnings call sell off reaction passes I think we\u2019ll bounce back to the low 50s and start climbing to the $60s.",

Expect a late game grand slam, and if the market hasn't already been swayed in favor of the tech giants and earnings week, AAPL will convince them otherwise. Game 2 will also consist of AMD batting .320 like it always does, and even if it slumps early, it'll be back to hitting .320 by the end of the week. \n\nGame 3 could be a huge game for TSLA.. can TSLA really continue to bat a red hot .700 for a whole series and keep knocking in RBIs at a godly pace? My bet is yes. But it will be MSFT who brings home Game 3 and carries the team through the rest of the week. Expect a monster homerun that signifies the death of team beer virus.. one of those games where you feel the breath absolutely knocked out of the opponent. FB will choke, going 2-31 this series.\n\nGame 4 is just a continuation of team earnings game 2 and 3 victories and AMZN shines with a 3-5 day with a few RBIs, nothing incredible but enough to seal the victory for team earnings. Regardless of how game 5 plays out, the series was won here.\n\n\nMSFT 150c's and 160c's\nTSLA 6/2020 700c\nAMD 1/2021 30c and couple hundred shares\nAlways holding shares of GOOG\n253 shares of TQQQ\n\nMSFT will be MVP.",

[AAPL, -0.29%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/aapl?mod=MW_story_quote) and Microsoft Corp [MSFT, -1.01%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/msft?mod=MW_story_quote) Plenty of non-Dow  companies will throw their numbers in as well \u2014 141 of the S&amp;P 500  companies are expected to report, including Facebook Inc. [FB, -0.83%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fb?mod=MW_story_quote), Amazon.com Inc. [AMZN, -1.22%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amzn?mod=MW_story_quote) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc [AMD, -2.63%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amd?mod=MW_story_quote) \n\nThe 85 members of the S&amp;P 500 that have reported results thus far  have seen net income fall by 0.3% on average from a year ago, though  Credit Suisse Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Jonathan Golub said it\u2019s  tough to make broader inferences from early reports given different  sectors tend to post results at different parts of the earnings cycle.  More than a third of S&amp;P 500 that have reported so far sit in the  financials sector, which could skew those results.\n\nThe  FactSet consensus currently calls for net income to fall by 1.9% for  the S&amp;P 500, based on a blend of reported results and analyst  projections, which would mean [the current earnings recession ](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/earnings-recession-is-expected-to-swallow-all-of-2019-after-holiday-forecasts-disappoint-2019-11-22)would swallow all of 2019\u2019s results.\n\nHere\u2019s what to watch for in the week ahead. \n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-dow-is-about-to-face-its-stiffest-test-in-years-2020-01-25](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-dow-is-about-to-face-its-stiffest-test-in-years-2020-01-25)",

        "selftext": "Back at it again with another recommendation. Hopefully you guys are swimming in tendies for SBUX!\n\nTo address the concerns: Apple going up 34% on the 3 month chart and 13% on the monthly is not a huge concern for me mainly because of these gains are supported by the integration and expansion of  Apple's service revenue and wearables (airpods/watches) revenue as part of it's core investment strategy. I think it's a healthy move to diversify and branch out from the flagship iPhone revenue which generates some 60% of it's revenue. Apple looks to be staging a great foundation for the development of the service platform which aims to help provide an insurance for customers at a relatively reasonable price ( which I assume will become even more affordable and therefore, profitable as they scale this area). Numbers in last fiscal quarter also suggest a growing revenue share in this area. As per the wearables technology, the watches are becoming increasingly adapted to the active lifestyle market, which is an attractive combination of both technology and sports. I don't see a big competitor in this space as Apple has already established such a strong foundation in this product and the dominance of it's competitors are disproportionately favorable for Apple.\n\nOn second thought, the airpods are also a great technology that they can expand on. Recently there is some buzz on earphones as a health product, by integrating technology that can monitor heart rate and blood pressure through the ear canal via the airpods. This makes a great deal of sense as the skin is much thinner in the ear passageway compared to the wrist that the watch monitors off of. Would be really cool to see if they can work with something like this, and perhaps even integrate a voice recognition system and a translating software (like Google) to make the airpods more than just convenient, but highly accessible. \n\nI'd assume that ER will do commensurately better than the previous year, and we should be seeing some great numbers to support this growth. ALSO! integration of AMD technology into their new macbooks are going to be big for gamers and tech enthusiasts who have largely been accustomed to the Intel processors for ages. AMD is also a grow and developing company and their potential in unison with Apple can be a game changer for the software/high performance gaming market that Apple can also enter into. So, cheers to that my friends! Goodluck!",

U.S. stock futures are sliding early Monday following Wall Street\u2019s worst day of 2020 on Friday. The Dow already has a four-day losing streak in place, its longest since August, and is coming off its largest weekly loss in five months. The S&amp;P 500\u2032s weekly decline last week was its largest in nearly four months. (CNBC)\n* Treasury yields move lower as coronavirus fears escalate (CNBC)\n* Gold climbs to 2-week high as virus fears spark safety buying (Reuters)\n* International oil prices drop below $60 as China virus drives demand concern (Reuters)\n* More than 2,800 people in China are now infected by the fast-spreading Wuhan coronavirus while more countries have reported their first confirmed cases. Chinese officials have said there are 2,862 confirmed cases, with the death toll rising to 81. On Sunday, the United States on Sunday reported its fifth confirmed case in Arizona. (CNBC)\n* Travel-related stocks are likely to be hit once again as coronavirus cases mount, including major airlines like United (UAL), Delta (DAL), American (AAL) and Southwest (LUV), and cruise line operators like Royal Caribbean (RCL), Norwegian (NCLH), and Carnival (CCL). Starbucks (SBUX) and McDonald\u2019s have temporarily closed near the Chinese city of Wuhan.\n* On today\u2019s U.S. economic calendar, the government will release its December report on new home sales at 10 a.m. ET. Arconic (ARNC), DR Horton (DH) and Sprint (S) are among the companies issuing quarterly earnings this morning, while Whirlpool (WHR), Juniper Networks (JNPR) and Rambus (RMBS) report after the bell.\n* Federal safety investigators launched a probe into a helicopter crash in the LA area that killed basketball legend Kobe Bryant and eight others, including his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna. The cause of the crash has not yet been determined. NBA athletes, officials and fans mourned Bryant\u2019s death in messages and memorials across social media.

According to local media, the plane went down in territory under Taliban control. It was initially reported to be a jet from state-owned Ariana Afghan Airlines. However, the airline\u2019s acting CEO has denied that one of their planes has crashed. (CNBC)\n* President Donald Trump is expected to disclose details of his long-delayed Mideast peace proposal to Israeli leaders today. Trump will hold separate, back-to-back meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Benny Gantz, head of the centrist Blue and White Party. Gantz is Netanyahu\u2019s rival in March 2 elections. (Reuters)\n* Trump\u2019s impeachment trial enters a pivotal week as his defense team resumes its case and senators face a critical vote on whether to hear witnesses or proceed directly to a vote that is widely expected to end in his acquittal. The articles of impeachment charge Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. (AP)\n* Democrats stepped up their calls for former national security advisor John Bolton to testify at the trial after an explosive report alleged that in his unpublished book, he said Trump personally tied Ukraine aid to an investigation of the Bidens, an account that conflicts with the president\u2019s. (NBC News)\n* Trump denies telling Bolton Ukraine aid was tied to investigations (The Hill)\n* Sen. Bernie Sanders holds an edge in the 2020 New Hampshire Democratic primary as the key presidential nominating contest nears, according to an NBC News/Marist poll.

Let\u2019s say if I sell amd $51 calls I can not lose unless it reaches $51(meaning that a 50.90 close it\u2019s still a win)? Or just the fact that it\u2019s getting closer to the strike can hurt me?",
