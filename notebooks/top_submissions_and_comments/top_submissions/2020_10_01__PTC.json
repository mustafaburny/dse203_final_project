        "selftext": "This is an overlooked topic -- **health insurance.** In the USA, at the Federal level, the individual mandate is no longer the law, but many individual states still require you to carry minimum coverage or face a penalty. PLEASE DO THE MATH and figure out for yourself (and your family) if having coverage is a wise or bad investment. Many healthy people are throwing away tens of thousands of dollars a year for coverage they don't need nor use. \n\nOpen enrollment is coming in November. Of course, the COVID-19 pandemic is going to be front and center by the medical and insurance industries to get you to commit to a plan. Be it Bronze, Silver or Gold, be sure to know what the PTC will be with respect to your projected income. From my observation, many people are literally throwing money away just for the sake of \"mental comfort\" or peace of mind. Is the cost worth it?",

        "selftext": "  \n\nPositions: BABA, TCHEY, BIDU, NIO, TSM, AVGO \n\nThesis: These companies still have a big growth potential and will have success in pretty much every situation I can think of. If the US continues to rip and has a real V-shaped recovery, Asia will rip with it. If the US crashes due to a financial crisis or reemergence of a public health crisis, Asia has pretty much completely reopened, has almost no community spread, and will be a safe haven while the US tries to recover. I don't know if the US is in a  bubble or not, but I think the multi-trillion market cap of the US tech giants limits upside regardless of how well they perform. I'm also convinced the US is about get fucked by a convergence of a second wave and a bad influenza season. Even if they don't the risk of a US economic crisis over the next year is objectively high.  \n\nBABA and TCHEY: Chinese megacaps that are still valued at under $1T and will definitely eventually get there. I wish I could buy options in Tencent. They are basically Facebook, PayPal, Activision Blizzard, and Softbank combined. Alibaba still has potential to expand into the rest of Asia including India if India-China relations improve. Both companies have virtual monopolies in their main areas of business in China and are not subject to anti-trust legislation going forward like their US counterparts. \n\nNIO and BIDU: Have tiny market caps compared to their US counterparts. Google\u2019s market cap is almost 30x higher than Baidu\u2019s and they trade at about the same P/E ratio. I\u2019ve already made a killing on Nio, which is valued at 30B compared to Tesla\u2019s nearly 500B. Chinese EV appetite is also way bigger than that of the US and the recent upgrade of Nio predicts the Chinese EV market to quadruple by 2025. I expect Nio to eventually break into US and European markets. They\u2019ve also successfully implemented battery swapping and won\u2019t need to invest in vertical integration the same way Tesla is in trying to overcome battery charge life obstacles. Both Baidu and Nio are investing heavily in fully autonomous vehicles. \n\nTSM and AVGO: Semiconductors will continue to see growth in the coming years and it\u2019s the only sector that I have confidence in right now. Another bonus if you choose to buy stock, both of these companies have generous dividends and can represent a decent hedge over the growth companies I listed. If the trade war heats up, they are located in Taiwan and Singapore respectively and will be beneficiaries of changes to US/EU supply chain. TSM is producing high quality chips cheaply and will be a big player in data center, autonomous driving, and AI. Broadcom just inked a deal with Apple for wireless components and will be a big 5G beneficiary. \n\nHow I\u2019m playing it: Long-dated calls that are way out of the money in each of these positions. I\u2019m counting on them to all at least double in the next two years. All of my calls are either Jan 2022 or Jan 2023. I also have sold out of all US stocks in my IRA and bought long positions in only in these names. The only one I\u2019m not holding calls in is TCHEY because I use Robinhood and am not aware of any way to buy options in it.",

        "selftext": "Note: saw I have a lot of messages yesterday on my old username, MiltDavis. This is where I've been posting now cuz mods, so message me here.\nI'm not an expert or anything, but I see a lot of people in the Daily Thread comments slanging VXX around, and a lot of weird information out there. Just trying to be helpful, so here ya go:\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**The most basic thing to know is that VIX (so VXX and UVXY by extension) is a measurement of market volatility, not SPY performance.**\u00a0 Let's say you buy a bunch of AAPL options of one month expiry at an implied volatility (IV) of 50 and FB at an IV of 20, but you have them ending up the same percentage higher at the strike price of your one month expiry--let's say 5% higher.\u00a0 The logic is that, due to historical and current factors, AAPL is expected to bounce around in much higher and lower swings to reach that 5%--a wilder journey, but the same destination.\u00a0 The volatility of that journey is what VIX represents, on an extrapolated level, for SPY as a whole.\u00a0 Think of it like this--VIX is the measurement of IV for the market as a whole, rather than for an individual equity. Because of this...\n\n**VIX does not have to always directly inverse SPY, but instead just often does\u201480% of the time.** VIX can rise with SPY--or fall with SPY--it's just not as common as inversing SPY.\u00a0 It can also do it's own thing entirely.\u00a0 Certain sectors can be performing one way, and SPY another, and these performances factor into the underlying measurements to prevent a break with SPY due to weighting and a shitload of other factors.\u00a0 SPY can climb rapidly, and volatility can rise with it, because the sharp movement creates just as much variation chaos in the underlyings as a precipitous drop would.\n\n**VIX is represented as an annualized standard deviation number within SPY.**\u00a0 If VIX is 25, for example, it is estimating movement of 25% in price action in SPY over the course of the next year.\u00a0 It was above 50 during the March crash, which, when you think about it in those terms, is nuts.\n\n\u00a0 **VIX is a monthly price estimation based on SPY options premiums.**\u00a0 SPY trades on it's underlyings and is also tradeable in and of itself, whereas VIX is vessel for trading a bundle of spreads, for lack of a better term.\u00a0 This is a mathematical--even theoretical--estimate on future market movement based on how much premium people are willing to pay for S&amp;P options, or in other words, it is an estimate of market volatility based on how much money people are willing to pay for insurance on their stocks.\u00a0\u00a0Equity prices are ONLY as important here inasmuch as they effect the pricing of the equity options. The more people are willing to pay for options, the higher VIX goes.\n\n**VIX is NOT the in-the-moment measurement of the underlying SPY put/call option spread\u2014it is\u00a0forward looking to the monthy expiration**.\u00a0\u00a0In the case of VIX this is a minimum of 23 days and up to 37 days out, with weighting favored toward the one month expiration.\u00a0 The math is crazy and intricate, on some Rainman shit, but the important thing to know is that VIX isn't a prisoner of the moment, but instead a look at the coming one month landscape taking in all factors over that course in time.\n\n*Real life example*: Many people have been expecting VIX to be much higher as we head into an election, but if we think of it in forward-looking, weighted terms, this moment may have passed--at least as far as the election is concerned.\u00a0 VIX is taking into consideration, at the moment,\u00a0 the perceived calmer times beginning toward the end of November after the election.\u00a0 If you go back and look at VIX values about one month prior to the election date, you can see that VIX was at it's peak on October 5th and 6th, reaching appproximately $30.\u00a0 This would correlate with the expected movement weighted one month from that day, or in other words, peak fear a day or two after the election.\n\n**Volatility is volatile, and therefore not a buy and hold: **VIX associates VXX and UVXY are known for making people rich on days like June 11th, or in September, when they suddenly climb 10, 15, 20% in a single day or a two day stretch.\u00a0 Yes, this a large part of it's appeal.\u00a0 But the real reason people get rich is that VIX IV can climb high--fast--because it's price movements are not considered lasting and great fluctuation becomes priced in.\u00a0 IV shoots up on these things like crazy, which means that the value of your VIX options shoots up like crazy.\u00a0 BUT, value also falls like crazy too, and it has intense theta burn (cost appreciation of the asset over time). So, while you are sitting around waiting to make your million dollar play with a VXX monthly you are losing a lot of money in the process.\u00a0 The VIX knows this, and it smells your weakness, and the day after you've dumped it because you've bled 50% it will rocket to new heights.\u00a0 Because of this...\n\n**VIX, VXX, and UVXY are meant as loss strategies and hedges, but not as outright plays.**\u00a0 Unless you are some Burry level TA specialist, or maybe my guy /u/winnning007, and you can pinpoint when certain events are going to happen or the market response within a day or two, you're best to keep a smaller amount as a hedge rather than go all in.\u00a0 The road to bagholding is short and full of terrors with volatility plays. B**UY SPY PUTS INSTEAD IF YOU ARE BEARISH**\n\n**VIX VXX and UVXY\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-**\n\nSo all that is cool, but VIX is a futures instrument and not a daily tradeable ETF/ETN; *enter VXX and UVXY.*\u00a0 To keep it simple, I'm going to lump the two together and just say that UVXY is a more levered version of VXX.\u00a0 So UVXY can climb higher than VXX when it rises, and fall lower than VXX when it falls.\u00a0 For the purposes of this explanation, I'm going to focus on VXX, but bottom line--if you don't really know what you're doing/aren't confident in your volatility move, stick with VXX rather than UVXY.\u00a0 The money is still good, don't be a hero.\n\n**VXX tracks the performance of VIX, but offers different expirations **(weekly ETF settlement dates like Friday/Saturday rather than the Wednesday of monthly futures), and tracks it at about a 50% level.\u00a0 In other words, if the VIX monthly futures have an 8% jump, expect about 4% for VXX monthlies.\u00a0 VXX is also an ETN, not an ETF--this is important because it means that it must have a direct tracking of the VIX unlike a fund which isn't beholden to a certain rate of correlation.\u00a0 In other words, VXX MUST track that ~50% of the VIX for efficacy.\n\nWhat's important here: VIX is the futures estimate bundle, and VXX is not VIX, but it is a\u00a0very reliable tracker of VIX price movements with few notable exceptions.\u00a0 UVXY is kind of like a levered version of VXX, meant to track with higher returns. These two can and do at times move out of sync with VIX due to something called contango.\n\n*If you want to go in depth on the intricacies of their relationship and contango and shit, I won\u2019t do that here, but this is a good resource:* https://www.schaeffersresearch.com/content/news/2015/02/04/the-messy-relationship-between-vix-and-vxx\n\n**Manipulation**\n\nWhenever VXX doesn't move with SPY, I bitterly joke that it's illegal and manipulated.\u00a0 This wayward movement is actually more due to the natural variance I pointed out earlier, but there is some truth to it.\u00a0 CBOE--the VIX providers--have been sued a few times over the past few years due to alleged manipulation of VIX.\u00a0 Of note, the \"Father of VIX\" as one article called it's creator, was one of the whistleblowers alleging fraud.\u00a0 The case was recently thrown out again, but the accusations speak for themselves.\n\n&gt;\tThe plaintiffs, traders in VIX-based products, filed a lawsuit alleging that certain features of the settlement process made it especially susceptible to manipulation but that Cboe chose not to enforce its rules against manipulation so it could continue to profit from the VIX products. Specifically, the complaint alleged violations of the Exchange Act antifraud provisions and the CEA and brought claims against both Cboe and anonymous \"Doe\" defendants that allegedly manipulated the settlement values for VIX options and futures by manipulating the two-zero-bid rule and employing a process analogous to \"banging the close.\"\n\nSo, ya know, innocent until proven guilty, but there is a lot of info out there to suggest that a lot of people invested in--and involved in the creation of--VIX through CBOE think it's manipulated.\u00a0 That can't be ignored.\n\n**Other tidbits to note:**\nA lot of little things matter with VIX; Quad witching dates, portfolio rebalancing dates, Congressional hearings with the FED, release of beige books, stress tests, and FOMC are all catalysts for VXX/UVXY activity if you're searching for short dated FD plays.\u00a0 Just look at the financial calendar on the FED website or Marketwatch, etc., before you make any moves against volatility. You're one JPOW speech to congress away from the big GUH.\n\n**Positions**: This was meant to be informative more than predictive.\u00a0\n\nThat said, I don't have a phenomenal read on this market--I'm not a TA guy generally, and a lot of the fundamentals are out the window as we approach the election.\u00a0 BUT, I expect anticipation of lame-duck political activity should there be a Blue Wave, PLUS uncertainty around COVID second wave restriction regression, PLUS the unveiling of a variety of coming tax changes in a Biden win, will likely bring higher pricing in option premiums and thus higher VIX.\n\n**UVXY 11/6 20c VXX 10/30 24c VXX 11/6 26c**\n**Earnings I like: NTGR, NOW, PYPL, MSFT, CVNA**\n**General shit I like: LMND, JD, DDOG**\n\n**TLDR: VIX does not always move with SPY, it may be manipulated, it is not meant to be held long term, and is future looking not day-to-day.\u00a0 Trade it thinking of a bigger picture rather than expecting it to react to every daily market event. Never go all in on a monthly, you\u2019ll theta bleed.**\n\nYou can message me and comment and stuff and I\u2019ll get to it.\u00a0\n\nI AM NOT AN EXPERT.\u00a0 A lot of the technical terminology you can probably argue with. This is just my own research and experiences.\u00a0 Do your own research.",

        "selftext": "I like Square as a company and see a lot of people are bullish about it. However, a few things stop me from investing. Be interested to hear thoughts but at the moment I am a Square bear. \n\n**Management**\n\nJack Dorsey is a visionary. I don\u2019t think this is controversial. However, his track record at Twitter is worrying for shareholders. Be it daily active user growth, ambition with acquisitions but ultimately failure to monetise a fantastic platform where you have big corporations, celebrities and even the President reaching out to 200m daily active users for free. With Square, the closed loop business model of businesses and consumers is again a fantastic concept that could break the power of Visa/Mastercard. Execution remains to be seen, of course. \n\n**Competition**\n\nSquare operate in a highly competitive field for consumers and businesses. Let\u2019s take consumers based on Square\u2019s fast-growing Cash App. It offers things a normal bank does like deposits, ATM access, money transfer. If it becomes a fully-fledged bank offering loans, credit; it is competing against the likes of big incumbents (e.g. JP Morgan, Bank of America). Granted they\u2019re dinosaur firms but they already have a huge customer base that are older and, therefore, have more money and deposits. This means it is much easier for them to monetise their customers resulting in high ARPU. Why would these lucrative customers, en-masse, want to uproot their finances to Square when their existing providers will be providing the same service by copying Square, as JP Morgan have done this week? [Link](https://www.pymnts.com/smbs/2020/jpmorgan-takes-on-square-and-paypal-at-the-point-of-sale/) \n\nFor businesses, Square\u2019s provides software offering (invoicing, PoS, online store) but face strong competition from the likes of Shopify who are taking a fully integrated service approach to SMEs which allows them to take their business online but also manage all their backend processes, including payments. This is a highly convenient service for entrepreneurs. Shopify already has 6% share of the online retail market. Square also provides hardware products which make it easy for SMEs, in particular, to take payments. However, there is evidence that retail is facing a more permanent shift in the US vs. the rest of the world with 60% less footfall today than a year ago [Link](https://www.spring-board.info/benchmarks/benchmark/daily-footfall). 58% of Square\u2019s GPV is from food/drink, retail and professional services. Square may have good market share but it is a shrinking industry.\n\nAnd as a final piece, competitors in both spaces are generally in very healthy financial shape: Paypal, Shopify, Global Payments, Western Union and big banks are well-capitalised. \n\n**Valuation**\n\nPerhaps you can get over the above with the fact that Square has strong network effects and are able to win customers cheaply. However, in my opinion, Square is priced for perfection. Simply looking at a price/sales metric, it is trading 13x LTM. This is high but maybe relatively reasonable for a fast-growing business. However, 25% of Square\u2019s revenue is accounted by Bitcoin \u201crevenue\u201d. This brings little value to Square (2% gross profit) and even Square themselves discount this revenue in their KPIs because it is \u201cout of their control and not reflective of Square\u2019s performance\u201d. \n\nNow onto profits. It is not fair to be too hard on Square\u2019s profitability. After all, it is in high growth phase and its marketing costs were its highest opex line item at roughly 35% for YTD. However, a cursory look at it is Enterprise Value / EBITDA (forward look to Dec2020), it is 242x. If we give credit for Square\u2019s business plan for a further two years, today\u2019s Enterprise Value over broker consensus forecast EBITDA for 2022, it is still a heady 77x. This is when Square is supposed to have EBITDA of $1bn which is three times more than it is forecast for Dec 2020. Priced to perfection.\n\nIf you compare it to Paypal, it is trading at 39x and 27x EV / EBITDA for Dec 2020 and 2022.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSquare has formidable backers like Ark Invest. I am also not a great believer in \u201cdumb retail\u201d overvaluing a stock for a prolonged period of time. But for reasons above, I am cautious with Square and yet it keeps climbing so please tell me what I am missing\u2026",

        "selftext": "What is your top convictions, where you feel as close to certain as you can about its future. Upside or downside. \n\nMine:\n\n\n1. Square ($SQ) is going to be a $1 trillion dollar company in my lifetime. I am honestly amazed how well this company is positioning themselves. They will move away from small business as they slowly replace the wallet and cash of the US. Similar things have already happened in Sweden, world leader in digital payments. Square is doing the same but in the US, while being the best trusted bitcoin handler and small business backend.\n\n2. Paypal ($PYPL) is slowly moving themselves into e commerce in a way they haven't before. They are light years ahead of anyone in ease of payment, and is rapidly spreading into a global power. If your country has a population, it takes PayPal for online purchases. On top of it, Venmo is the only threat to Squares cash app, so why not own both. \n\n3. Facebook ($FB) is going to be one of the solid heavy weights of the next 10 years, where some people vocally hate on them while they are raking in money hands over fists from the entire world. They have shown an almost disgusting ability of killing completion, and wouldn't be hurt much from a potential breakup (which I personally doubt will happen. Future post). Additionally, they just had a massive blow out success in VR, releasing the quest 2 incredibly successfully. VR will be mainstream and Facebook WILL be the king of it. \n\n:) \n\nAs you may notice from my picks, I am betting on the death of cash. And I really really do. No price targets as I plan holding these forever. My models to suggest overpriced fairly, but I belive their growth will accelerate as new services/monitazationa are released.\n\nWhat do you belive in?",

        "selftext": "Hey folks,\n\nI recently developed a [bot](https://twitter.com/TradyticsAIbot) that uses AI to analyze options flow and predicts directions for individual option contracts. It also tells you whether you should buy to open or sell to open a contract which is something that's not really available anywhere else. And it's 100% free since it's a [twitter account](https://twitter.com/TradyticsAIbot). Here are some alerts from today that I am keeping an eye on tomorrow and the next few days.\n\nBearish means the price of contract will go down while bullish means the price of contract will go up.\n\n# $PINS\n\nI believe both $PINS and [$SNAP](https://www.tradytics.com/bullseye-dashboard?alert=-Kw0NE-gbjJn-S7H2b-j6jZ7-1VL7D) are a bit overextended right now and need to dip. One of [SNAP](https://www.tradytics.com/bullseye-dashboard?alert=-Kw0NE-gbjJn-S7H2b-j6jZ7-1VL7D) alerts today had a gain of 85%. That is further confirmed by this alert. Bearish on CALL mean either Sell to Open the call or Buy to Open a put.\n\n[Track alert at: https:\\/\\/www.tradytics.com\\/bullseye-dashboard?alert=-U6wco-znVFx-RA167-DSU76-cvHSh](https://preview.redd.it/s138kigzbru51.png?width=587&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de09683f91d49b720fc53a2db1be3d5e6176a690)\n\n# $SQ\n\nSQ had dipped quite nicely the last few days and it is about to be on a resistance line ([https://i.imgur.com/ow1F4vh.png](https://i.imgur.com/ow1F4vh.png)). This contract seems to have a long expiry and this looks like a good one. Maybe too costly so you can get in on a cheaper one.\n\n[Track alert at: https:\\/\\/www.tradytics.com\\/bullseye-dashboard?alert=-t1xlI-wzasX-Vsip8-sHlJz-eD7fx](https://preview.redd.it/8cb6589ycru51.png?width=591&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1fb92211b9759b788b94db2ced908b0391f07f5)\n\n# $PYPL\n\nPYPL was about to break a good resistance level but failed ([https://i.imgur.com/NG02hoH.png](https://i.imgur.com/NG02hoH.png)). There is another support right below the current price so if we can somehow stay there, this is a good contract. Again, you can go a bit cheaper.\n\n[Track alert at: https:\\/\\/www.tradytics.com\\/bullseye-dashboard?alert=-lmRJF-bA5ZF-h5tE1-1tG13-cWlKf](https://preview.redd.it/v4sf93gddru51.png?width=594&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acdca1c06d4f43f92eef21388c1008e41e28e775)\n\nThat's it - I just want to see if there's demand for these daily alerts in the community here.

        "selftext": "With health care systems under intense scrutiny during the pandemic, Vancouver\u2019s Well Health Technologies Corp. has seen massive growth as it invests in digital tools to make care more efficient for clinicians and patients alike.\n\nWell\u2019s share price has risen nearly 350 per cent this year, to $6.98 on the Toronto Stock Exchange at the end of Friday, as the pandemic-dominated period has seen health care practitioners and clinics invest in telehealth and other digital health technologies. What began as a network of yoga studios has turned into a nimble medical-technology company with its sights set on improving how health clinics work.\n\nIn the past five weeks alone, Well has launched an app marketplace for clinic owners to find ways to manage aspects of their business such as online booking and workflow automation; announced a US$14-million controlling investment in the U.S. telehealth company Circle Medical, giving the company access to health care markets in 35 states; closed a $23-million private placement led by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing; and revealed a $70-million bought-deal financing underwritten by Eight Capital and Stifel GMP.\n\nIn an interview, Well\u2019s founder and chief executive Hamed Shahbazi said the company wants to take a long-view approach seeking technology that improves health outcomes. \u201cIt was not too long ago that we didn\u2019t even know we needed to sanitize our operating tools,\" he said. \"Technology is responsibly for our life expectancies increasing. ... We can\u2019t take it for granted.\u201d\n\nTechnology wasn\u2019t really what Mr. Shahbazi had in mind when he first founded the company as a network of yoga studios licensing Deepak Chopra\u2019s eponymous yoga-studio brand in Canada. In 2017, it listed on the TSX Venture Exchange under the name Wellness Lifestyles with a reverse takeover. That same year, PayPal Holdings Inc. bought Mr. Shahbazi\u2019s payment-processing company, Tio Networks Corp., for US$304-million \u2013 although PayPal suspended Tio operations several months later after a data breach was found.\n\nMr. Shahbazi first had no intention of running Wellness Lifestyles day to day, but soon became curious about the state of primary care in Canada. Everything he studied about Canadian health care, he said, \u201cseemed to point at all this fragmentation in the system.\u201d\n\nTechnology adoption has been slower here than in other countries. The 2019 Commonwealth Fund International Health Policy Survey of Primary Care Physicians, for example, found that a low percentage of Canadian doctors were able to electronically share information with other clinical providers: Just 22 per cent could share patient clinical summaries, for example, versus 93 per cent in Norway.\n\nAlthough Canada\u2019s health care system is public, Mr. Shahbazi realized its many privately owned medical clinics could benefit from technology sold at scale \u2013 saving their already busy physicians from having to deal with issues such as network security on their own. With Tio sold, Mr. Shahbazi became Wellness Lifestyles\u2019 CEO in May, 2018. The company rebranded as Well Health Technologies two months later, refocusing on primary care.\n\nMr. Shahbazi is a consolidator at heart and looked up to Canadian software acquisition powerhouses such as Constellation Software Inc. and Enghouse Systems Ltd. as he built up Tio in the previous decade. He\u2019s building Well the same way.\n\nThe company now has a network of 20 physical clinics in British Columbia; a new subsidiary to expand its \u201callied health\u201d holdings, such as sleep, mental-health and physiotherapy clinics; and a network of digital services that the company says serves more than 2,000 clinics and more than 10,000 physicians, largely in B.C. and Ontario. The company now has 266 employees on top of its health care practitioners, who work as independent contractors.\n\nWell\u2019s growing cache of software and partnerships is largely based off of the McMaster University-founded Open Source Clinical Application and Resource (OSCAR) system for electronic medical records. Mr. Shahbazi said he hopes that centralizing much of this software in Well\u2019s new app marketplace, called apps.health, will encourage more medical clinics to invest in digitization.\n\nLaurentian Bank Securities analyst Nick Agostino said the company\u2019s acquisition-heavy approach was wise. \u201cHaving both physical and virtual clinics makes a lot of sense to grab hold of patients and capture recurring revenue,\" he said.\n\nIn Canada, Well\u2019s strategy most closely competes with blended virtual-physical health care investments by legacy companies such as Loblaw Cos. Ltd. and the growing health wing of Telus Corp., Mr. Agostino said.\n\nWell jumped from the Venture Exchange to the TSX this past January, and its strategy has since pushed its market capitalization to more than $1-billion \u2013 more than triple the value of Tio when it was sold to PayPal.\n\nAnalyst Doug Taylor of Canaccord Genuity raised his price target for Well to $8 from $6 last week as the company announced its app marketplace at a moment when investors are already interested in health care technology. \u201cWell stands to benefit from streamlined cross-selling of its growing stable of proprietary health care technology assets and revenue sharing from third-party software,\u201d he wrote in a research note.\n\nThe pandemic-driven shift to digital pushed Well\u2019s revenue for the quarter ending June 30 to $10.6-million, up 43 per cent from the year prior. Digital services accounted for $2.3-million of that \u2013 a 1,212-per-cent increase from the year earlier, owing to pandemic adoption and Well\u2019s acquisition spree.\n\nhttps://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-well-health-ceo-sees-canadas-health-clinic-market-as-ripe-for/",

        "selftext": "I think there is a big way to make consistent money similar to trade deals and corona virus hype that people are not exploiting yet.\n\nEverytime stimulus news is brought up, payment providers rally. You can see this inPaypal, Visa, and Square right now.\n\nThis is partially lead to SQ reaching all time highs and Paypal and Visa to be close as well. Even though in contact payments from SQ is down, they have converted successfully via cashapp to online movements.\n\nLooking at some flow, look at $SQ\u2019s run on Friday:\nhttps://gyazo.com/1eb2621dfb91c6e1e72b6380464e48cf\n\nThis is despite the news of a wavering stimulus. In fact, it looks like option flow is heading that way on [these payment providers](https://twitter.com/unusual_whales/status/1311683758735597569) with big movements happening earlier this month in anticipation of the stimulus.\n\nPaypal and Visa are looking a little beat up in comparison, but I think the flow will hit them too. I suspect Monday/Tuesday we get a lot of talk about the stimulus after the weekend and Trump\u2019s Friday offers. Plus pressure from the populace to make a deal happen.\n\nFor example, Trump may go bigger than [a 2.2 trillion COVID stimulus](https://twitter.com/samstein/status/1315306191178825735).\n\nAs result, some positions I have: PYPL $202 call 10/30 and SQ $220 call 10/23, and I am bullish on all payment companies as a result.

I work for a university and make good money, and over the acedemic breaks over the summer I joined Etsy to sell some homemade good, and it did extraordinarily well. Now that I have a good positive cash flow, I want to invest and try to grow my money. I don't know much about the stock market, except that March was a good time to buy in lol. I don't know what calls are, I looked at r/wallstreetbets and found too much shit posting, joined in the GME hype and didn't sell out this morning so I ended up losing money on it, but not much at least. I also didn't know that the markets were closed on Saturday. Are they closed Sunday too? Do stocks continue to move during closed times or do they remain stagnant?\n\nTo the point. I'm looking at ETSY, Microsoft, PayPal, shopify, GE. They seem to be doing good, especially etsy which went up like $100 this year. But I don't know what good beginners stocks would be. I already bought into etsy with 1 share and earned a few bucks. But just because they are doing really good at this time, does it seem like a good idea to buy in? Especially during this pandemic with no stimulus anytime soon (I'm in the US), I'm afraid of the stocks falling again, but not too worried, sound like if they fall just buy in maybe?\n\nWhat are good strategies to find out what stocks are best? Do I follow certain companies closely to find out what moves they will make? How do I know if what they will do is going to be beneficial?

Though Pelosi\u2019s self-imposed deadline of 48-hours to reach an agreement came and went, discussions continue.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.08% down, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 0.21% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) underperformed the most, ending the day 0.35% down.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg TV that she was willing to keep stimulus discussions open past her Tuesday deadline and said she is \u201coptimistic\u201d about the progress being made. White House Chief of Staff Market Meadows said on CNBC that negotiators were working hard to get a deal done by the weekend, and that White House increased its offer by another $80 billion to $1.88 trillion.\n\nDespite support from the President and top government officials, questions remain over whether the Republican-controlled Senate, who have publicly disparaged the bill, would vote to advance any deal. Senate Republicans have so far baulked at the high price-tag the proposals. According to an article released by the New York Times, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell privately told Republican senators on Tuesday that he had warned the White House not to strike a pre-election deal with Speaker Nancy Pelosi on a new round of stimulus, moving to head off an agreement that President Trump has demanded but most in his party oppose. McConnell\u2019s remarks, which were confirmed by four Republicans familiar with them, threw cold water on Mr. Trump\u2019s increasingly urgent push to enact a new round of pandemic aid before Election Day and came just as Ms. Pelosi offered an upbeat assessment of her negotiations with Steven Mnuchin.\n\nIn other news, Senate Democrats successfully blocked the Republicans\u2019 attempt to pass a targeted $500 billion coronavirus bill, with Pelosi, Mnuchin, and the White House engaged in a desperate attempt to come to a much-needed agreement before the November election. The bill, similar to one the Republicans tried to pass some weeks ago, fell in a 51-44 vote, falling short of the 60 supermajority required. Republicans in Congress argue Democrats have reached for an expensive wish list filled with many provisions unrelated to the crisis. McConnell said the Democrats are engaging in \u201call-or-nothing obstruction\u201d as they hold out for a comprehensive deal worth about $2 trillion. In response, Democrats accuse the GOP of failing to recognize the magnitude of the economic and health crisis that is gripping the country. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (Democrat, New York) has called the Republican plan paltry, partisan, and emaciated. \n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she \u201chas a prospect for an agreement\u201d with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on a coronavirus stimulus package, but floated the possibility that it may not come together in time to pass both chambers before the Nov. 3 election. \u201cThere will be a bill. The question is: is it time to pay the November rent \u2014 my goal \u2014 or will it be shortly after. I want people to know that help is on its way. It will be bigger. It will be better. And it will be retroactive.\u201d It seems the chances for any sort of short-term stimulus before November 3 are slipping away.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Snapchat (SNAP) rocketed up today after posting better than expected quarterly earnings report.

        "selftext": "Just curious on a 2nd or 3rd opinion on a few stocks I've been eye balling. Would graciously appreciate someone with maybe some more knowledge opinion.\n\nWould love any insight you guys have on these tickers. Thanks again any constructive thoughts are GREATLY appreciated.  \n\n$NEE - Amazing Long term growth. Attempting to buyout other companies. Dividend has been rapidly increasing. Is the growth potentially done or near done?\n\n$AVGO - Amazing long term growth. Dividend has been RAPIDLY increasing. Can't imagine Broadcom getting smaller but just like NEE how much more growth is there still?\n\n$NVDA - INSANE long term growth. Big player in the market. Doubtful they are going anywhere in the future\n Trash dividend. And once again they have grown so much idk how much more they are likely to grow.\n\n$PYPL - Amazing long term growth. PayPal rumored to be moving into Ecommerence. Huge player for electronic transactions. I forsee them continuing to grow into the future.. No dividend \n\n$PENN - Amazing long term growth. Analysis put a $100 PT. I dont see gambling EVER going anywhere in the future. \n\n$COST - Decent long term growth. I feel like Costco is going to continue to grow as a super giant into the future. Dividend is slightly lacking. \n\n$U - New IPO. Unity is a huge player in the mobile app industry. If expect growth with them branching out. Not to mention I dont see mobile app using another company to this degree.\n\n$T - Mainly for the dividend. 10yr growth is a mere 2% on average. I feel like HBO MAX and the casual dividend increase will make up for this long term. \n\n$JPM - Decent long term growth. Bad PR recently but I dont see that holding it back. Dividend is pretty prime and the banking sector will grow once interest rates are settled. \n\n$CRSR - New IPO.HUGE player in the ESports community. Doesn't seem to be slowing down at all. Big on Twitch.tv with sponsorships and the streaming industry. Esport is a rapidly growing industry. Sadly no dividend as of now. \n\n$KIRK - There site is a overstock wayfair look alike. In the future I can see them rapidly growing just as those did. Even to some degree the growth potential would be massive.\n\n$JMIA - Essentially the amazon of Europe/Africa. Branching out into the African market. The growth on this seems like it could be exponential.\n\n$AGO - New IPO. Sells camping gear as well as GUNS and AMMO. Comparing it to camping world [$CWH] seems like there's alot of potential growth in the market.",

Things like retro video games, Pokemon cards, etc seem to have a lot of value for those who want to relive their youth. So as someone in their 30s, looking 10-20 years down the road I can look at my kids and current trends to figure out what might be valuable in the future. \n\nI see a few challenges with this though, first who knows what will be popular just like who knows what stock will be worth 100x more 10-20 years from now. Second I think there is a lot more knowledge and availability than their used to be. Back in the 80s/90s there was no internet, eBay, PayPal, etc. As a result people just sold stuff at garage sales, threw away or didn't keep in good condition. I think the market in the future will have more inventory making for less profitable items.\n\nThat being said, what would you say are items that might be worth money in the future? Sealed PS4, Switch games, current generation Pokemon, trading cards?",

        "selftext": " ***PayPal (Nasdaq: PYPL) Q3 Earnings Play***\n\nPayPal earnings are coming up in october and the company has a lot of potential as they already crushed Q2 earnings.\n\n**General facts**\n\n* 73% YTD growth\n* $225B Market Cap\n* 2019 Revenue: $17.772B\n\nThe stock went down in [september](https://i.imgur.com/FHA4reY.png) and is now on for a earnings [run-up](https://i.imgur.com/uJ0M4QX.png). PayPal is currently sitting around $15 below its ATH. There is probably no need to explain what PayPal is or what it does.\n\nTotal Payment Volume (TPV)\n\n\"Total  Payment Volume or \"TPV\" is the value of payments, net of payment  reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform,  excluding transactions processed through our gateway products.\"\n\n\\--&gt; *Fees on money transactions*\n\nThat means that PayPal makes more money when more transactions are being made.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n1iw3tt13dr51.png?width=554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c5711eda5ad1f0422692e74985c16820a43f0fe\n\n**Free Cashflow (FCF)**\n\n$2.19B in Q2 with an increase 112% y/y\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2tr61wt23dr51.png?width=550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f3f312a637670c54ebbd70fb223f49b60e5d4fc\n\n\\--&gt;  Now you are probably asking yourself what all those fucking images and  words mean. It\u00b4s simple. PayPal has seen a lot of new users due to the  pandemic and everyone ordering their shit from Jeff Bezos. We are still  in a pandemic and the second wave is about to come. This means that more  and more people are going to use services like PayPal and as I stated  above; more users means more transactions which means more money for PayPal. So more tendies for us.

TPV will rise due to more and more people using PayPal due to the Pandemic. This will lead the FCF to rise as well and this makes stonks go up for us to make some tendies.\n\n**New Customers**\n\nPayPal has seen a rise in new accounts of 21.3 million in Q2.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6xkjfind3dr51.png?width=414&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1c34c732b58eb2c3daa5581dffaa5d0a5ba565b\n\n**So how are we making tendies on the upcoming earnings?**\n\nPayPal is expecting \"strong momentum from Q2 to continue into Q3\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1slqhmre3dr51.png?width=478&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9fa90bc61c64cebfb38f1b4d565bd4ab7172632\n\n*They will be crushing earnings* [*again*](https://i.imgur.com/iBhZqrE.png) *like they did in Q2 (actual Growth: 22% and 25%)*\n\nAnalysts have set a *price target around $220.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img n0vw56pf3dr51...*\n\n**Recent News**\n\n\"PayPal and Mastercard will continue the global expansion of its PayPal Business Debit Mastercard.\" [Source](https://www.mobilepaymentstoday.com/news/paypal-business-debit-mastercard-expands-european-market-reach/)\n\nThey also announced to support black communities and businesses.

        "selftext": "China might be the best hedge for U.S. stocks.\n\nKey Chinese indexes and stocks are outperforming their U.S. counterparts, and investor sentiment suggests that Asia might even emerge as an economic haven, as America and Europe are still struggling with the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Xtrackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-Shares exchange-traded fund (ticker: ASHR), a proxy for mainland China\u2019s stocks, is up 18% this year, compared with 6% for the S&amp;P 500 index.\n\nShares of Alibaba Group Holding (BABA), one of China\u2019s most important companies, are up 36% this year. Alibaba, given its broad scope, might just help investors insulate their portfolios at a time of unusual duress in U.S. history\u2014acting in the role once occupied by fixed income when it was an effective offset to equity weakness.\n\nWhen President Donald Trump surprisingly ended stimulus negotiations with a Tuesday tweet, U.S. stocks sank. Many Chinese stocks, notably Alibaba, held up.\n\nHedging U.S. portfolios with Chinese stocks, particularly Alibaba, might seem outlandish, but Susquehanna Investment Group, a top options-trading firm that seeks out noncorrelated U.S. equity investments, has significant China exposure. The secretive trading company owns a huge piece of ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, that could be worth more than $15 billion. The investment would probably dwarf anything the firm\u2019s partners have ever realized in a long history of extraordinary success.\n\nAlibaba will never protect a portfolio the way traditional hedges, such as S&amp;P 500 options, do, but Alibaba\u2019s options premiums and stock price aren\u2019t as distorted ahead of the bizarre U.S. presidential election. Trading volumes on the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, are stunningly anemic during the oddest trading year since the 2008-09 financial crisis, suggesting that investors have little faith that VIX derivatives will work as expected.\n\nBut adding China exposure, especially Alibaba, to a portfolio offers hedging through diversification.\n\nAlibaba will hold its annual Singles Day event on Nov. 11. For 24 hours, Alibaba will host an online sale and celebration that makes Amazon.com\u2019s (AMZN) Prime Day seem like a Rotary Club luncheon. The company will probably report quarterly earnings in early November.\n\nIn 2019, Singles Day sales totaled $38 billion, up from $31 billion in the previous year. This year\u2019s event will indicate how much Asian consumers have recovered from the coronavirus. Powerful sales results will intrigue investors who are worried about the sclerotic U.S. and European economies and concerned about political mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nWith Alibaba\u2019s stock at $296.50, investors can sell Alibaba\u2019s November $295 put for $18.20 and buy Alibaba\u2019s November $300 call for $17.60. The trade generates a credit of 60 cents. If Alibaba\u2019s stock is at $310 at expiration, the call is worth $10. Should the stock price be below the put strike price at expiration, investors are obligated to buy the stock at the strike price, or to cover the put at a higher prices.\n\nDuring the past 52 weeks, Alibaba\u2019s stock has ranged from $161.68 to $299. Shares are up 80% over the past year.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s attraction extends beyond hedging and diversification. The stock monetizes the rise of Asia\u2019s middle class, which is one of the world\u2019s greatest economic trends. Alibaba\u2019s scope is so broad that anyone who buys the stock essentially gets the Asian equivalent of a portfolio of companies similar to eBay (EBAY), PayPal Holdings (PYPL), Goldman Sachs Group (GS), FedEx (FDX), United Parcel Service (UPS), and the entertainment studios.\n\nReports indicate that China\u2019s economy is already recovering from the coronavirus. Goldman has even advised clients that Asia is well positioned compared with other areas because it has contained the virus. The irony is unpleasantly rich.",

United Airlines (UAL 34.25, -1.36, -3.8%) reported worse-than-expected results, which kept the airline stocks grounded today. \n* Looking ahead to Friday, investors will receive Retail Sales for September, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for September, the preliminary University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for October, Business Inventories for August, and Net Long-term TIC Flows for August.  \n## Index Summary\n &lt;b&gt;S&amp;P 500 :&lt;/b&gt; (-0.12%); &lt;b&gt;NasDaq : &lt;/b&gt;(-0.71%); \\\n&lt;b&gt;Russell 2000 :&lt;/b&gt;(+1.03%); &lt;b&gt;Dow :&lt;/b&gt;(-0.03%); \\\n&lt;b&gt;Vix :&lt;/b&gt;26.4 (+2.16%); [+2.31%]; {-2.39%} \n## Sectors Summary \n_Three highest sectors for today were -_ \n&lt;b&gt;Energy: &lt;/b&gt;(+1.21%); &lt;b&gt;Financials: &lt;/b&gt;(+0.77%); &lt;b&gt;Real Estate: &lt;/b&gt;(+0.47%) \\\n_Three lowest sectors for today were -_\n &lt;b&gt;Communication Services: &lt;/b&gt;(-0.77%); &lt;b&gt;Health Care: &lt;/b&gt;(-0.73%); &lt;b&gt;Information Technology: &lt;/b&gt;(-0.45%) \n## Commodities/Futures \n(1-day %), [5-day %], {10-day %} \\\n_**Currency -**_ \\\n&lt;b&gt;USD Index :&lt;/b&gt;93.366 (+0.51%); [+0.8%]; {+0.11%}\\\n &lt;b&gt;BC :&lt;/b&gt;11410 (+1.84%); [-0.09%]; {+9.31%} \\\n_**Precious Metals -**_\\\n&lt;b&gt;Gold :&lt;/b&gt;1907.3 (+0.29%); [-0.5%]; {+0.62%}  &lt;b&gt;Silver :&lt;/b&gt;24.395 (+0.14%); [-3.17%]; {+2.35%}\\\n _**Farming -**_ \\\n&lt;b&gt;Soybeans :&lt;/b&gt;1056.25 (+0.52%); [+2.71%]; {+1.7%}  \n&lt;b&gt;Corn :&lt;/b&gt;396.5 (+1.83%); [+3.79%]; {+4.87%} \\\n&lt;b&gt;Coffee :&lt;/b&gt;109.6 (+0.05%); [+0.46%]; {+1.86%} \\\n_**Industrials -**_ \\\n&lt;b&gt;Crude :&lt;/b&gt;41.04 (-0.29%); [+3.78%]; {+0.61%} \\\n&lt;b&gt;Nat Gas :&lt;/b&gt;2.636 (+5.5%); [-3.47%]; {+10.36%} \\\n&lt;b&gt;Copper :&lt;/b&gt;3.0505 (+1.13%); [+0.78%]; {+4.03%} \n## Dark Pool Summary - \nHighest Dark Pool buys by rank -\\\n            1.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 12th, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings could be a positive force for stocks as Washington continues to wrangle over stimulus  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/09/earnings-could-be-a-positive-force-for-stocks-as-washington-continues-to-wrangle-over-stimulus.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stock market optimism for a stimulus package has been rising, but the focus swings to earnings and that could be a positive for stocks in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; JPMorgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley all release earnings in the first big wave of corporate reports. There is also some important data, including CPI inflation data Tuesday and retail sales for September on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt looks like earnings season might turn out better than expected, based on early reports,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cThe guidance looks pretty good. So, we have earnings season upon us, the stimulus talks go back and forth, and it looks like maybe there\u2019s a will to get something done.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; On Friday afternoon, the White House raised its offer for at stimulus package to $1.8 trillion but was still below the $2.2 trillion sought by Democrats. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to read,\u201d said Keon.\n*****\n&gt; But he said even if there\u2019s no agreement on stimulus now, there should be a package after the election, regardless of who wins. \n*****\n&gt; \u201cI actually put some money to work in small caps on the belief if we get further stimulus either soon or a few months from now, you do want to own economically sensitive stocks,\u201d said Keon.\u201cWe\u2019re reasonably constructive on the market and valuations are not cheap, but compared to the 10-year [Treasury yield] at less than 80 basis points, stocks don\u2019t look that bad.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks in the past week had their best performance since early July, with the S&amp;P 500 up 3.8% at 3,477. The small cap Russell 2000 was up 6.4%. The 10-year Treasury yield had a big move during the week from about 0.70% to as high as 0.79% Friday. Yields move opposite price, and the 10-year yield has now broken out of a range its been stuck in below 0.70%.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings could provide positive momentum for stocks, if companies continue to beat estimates at a healthy pace, like last quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cQ2 reporting season saw S&amp;P 500 earnings beat at an unprecedented rate, both in terms of breadth (85%) and size (+20%), prompting historically rare, strong upgrades to forward estimates, especially for the cyclicals, and one of the strongest earnings season rallies on record,\u201d wrote Deutsche Bank strategists.\n*****\n&gt; The summer earnings rally came before the big September decline, which took the S&amp;P 500  down about 10%. The S&amp;P 500 is up more than 8% since Sept. 24.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhile the bottom-up consensus for Q3 is for a sharp rebound in headline earnings, the bulk of it is being driven by reductions in loan loss provisions and Energy sector losses. Excluding these, underlying earnings growth is forecast to barely move up (-15% to -13%), despite rising Q3 GDP growth estimates pointing to a strong macro rebound,\u201d they noted.\n*****\n&gt; The Deutsche strategists said the question remains, however, whether the market will respond to earnings beats or election uncertainty.\n*****\n&gt; Keon said the market has been moving up as former vice president Joe Biden extended his lead in the polls because there\u2019s less chance of an uncertain outlook the more one candidate leads. According to RealClearPolitics, he was leading President Donald Trump by 9.7 percentage points, from just about  6 points at the beginning of the prior week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think from the market\u2019s perspective, it doesn\u2019t really matter who wins, as long as we have a clear winner,\u201d said Keon. \u201cI think the direction of the polls are suggesting that we\u2019re going to have a clear winner either on election night or a few days after that. The risk of a messy contested election is going down, and the market is relieved by that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Tom Block, Washington analyst at Fundstrat, said Trump appears to be hoping for a stimulus bill signing before the election to help his re-election effort.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere are many moving parts here, and they\u2019re all moving in different directions,\u201d said Block. \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible a deal comes together but the pathway to a deal is not clear on Friday afternoon because of the mixed signals that have come out over the last seven days from the White House.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has opposed a large package, and the two sides have been stalemated. \u201cI think the president believes that he will be helped by having a signed ceremony at the White House approving the bill, that the optics of signing the bill that\u2019s going to send relief to people is an optic he desperately wants, and it can\u2019t hurt,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The economic recovery is going on in the background, and some parts of the economy have shown real improvement, like housing.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales on Friday is a good look at how the consumer has been faring, now that enhanced unemployment benefits have been gone for the past two months. Economists expect 0.6% gain in retail sales, the same as August.\n*****\n&gt; Keon said it is important to get some more help for the economy through stimulus. There is expected to be one-time payments to individuals and enhanced employment benefits.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat would be good news for the market, if we could get more help where it is needed. We really just need to get a bridge for a more normal circumstances next year,\u201d said Keon.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/4K1MVFr.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TogcA3z.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/LSeLvCN.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/ksFc8um.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xCRPIpj.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pbYmOWI.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/U3OyIJ0.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qnhClbM.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eD2gAHd.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ow0caWu.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/nznrtfX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/bm1ckAt.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Ten-Baggers Under Trump\n\n&gt; In our prior post we looked at the best and worst performing S&amp;P 500 stocks since Election Day 2016. In this post we've broadened our filter and looked at the Russell 3,000, which is an index that covers more than 98% of all publicly traded market cap in the US. Within the Russell 3,000, there are 32 stocks that are up more than 1,000% since Trump was elected. These 32 \"ten-baggers\" -- as Peter Lynch liked to call them -- are listed in the table below.\n\n&gt; At the top of the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH), which is up 8,892% since Election Day 2016. While Enphase has \"Energy\" in its company name, it's actually a Technology sector stock that \"manufactures software-driven home energy solutions that span solar generation, home energy storage and web-based monitoring and control.\" Next up is Zynex (ZYXI) with a gain of 7,211%, followed by Digital Turbine (APPS) up 5,320%. ZYXI markets itself as a \"better and safer way to manage pain\" than opiods using electrotherapy devices. APPS is an app marketing company that helps app developers get their product on as many devices as possible.\n\n&gt; Of the 16 best performing Russell 3,000 stocks since Election Day 2016, 15 come from either the Technology or Health Care sectors. XPEL is the only stock in the top ten that's not in either the Tech or Health Care sectors. Up 2,341% since Trump was elected, XPEL is a Consumer Discretionary stock whose main product is to provide auto-paint protection.\n\n&gt; Along with the names mentioned already, other notables on the list of ten-baggers under Trump include Jack Dorsey's Square (SQ), pet-food maker Freshpet (FRPT), digital health company Teladoc (TDOC), the arts and crafts social media company Etsy (ETSY), and of course, Tesla (TSLA). With a gain of 1,002% since November 8th, 2016, Tesla just barely makes the cut!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/tenbaggers.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best Performing Stocks Since Election Day 2016\n\n&gt; On Monday we published our asset class performance matrix showing total returns for key ETFs since Election Day 2016 (11/8/16). Today we wanted to highlight the individual stocks traded on US exchanges that have performed the best and the worst since President Trump surprised the world with a victory over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. First off, below is a chart showing the average performance of stocks in each S&amp;P 500 sector since Election Day 2016. (These are based on stocks currently in the index and not as the index stood on 11/8/16.)\n\n&gt; As shown, the average stock in the broad S&amp;P 500 is up 67.3% since Trump was elected. Four sectors have posted stronger average returns than that -- Technology (+160.4%), Health Care (+100.3%), Consumer Discretionary (+74.6%), and Industrials (+69.9%).\n\n&gt; The Energy sector stands out like a sore thumb in the chart below. While every other sector has at least averaged double-digit percentage gains, the stocks in the Energy sector are down an average of 52.3% since Trump was elected! Other sectors that have been weaker than the broad market include Real Estate, Consumer Staples, and Financials.\n\n&gt; If you were to ask most people back in November 2016 which areas of the market should outperform under Trump and which should underperform, you'd likely see results that are the exact opposite of what has actually happened. Sectors like Energy, Real Estate, and Financials would have been expected to benefit from Trump since those are the industries he's most associated with, while Tech is a sector that's usually expected to benefit more when the Democratic party is in control.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/avgsector.png))**\n\n&gt; Looking at individual stocks, below we show the 46 stocks currently in the S&amp;P 500 that are up at least 200% since Election Day 2016. Two stocks -- Etsy (ETSY) and Advanced Micro (AMD) -- have been \"10-baggers\" with gains of more than 1,000%, while another three -- Paycom (PAYC), NVIDIA (NVDA) and DexCom (DXCM) -- are up more than 500%. Other names on the list are a who's who of the most popular stocks over the past few years, including Adobe (ADBE), Netflix (NFLX), Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), salesforce.com (CRM), and PayPal (PYPL).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/bestsince16.png))**\n\n&gt; While there are 46 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 up more than 200% since Election Day 2016, there are 32 stocks that are down more than 50% over the same time frame. The Energy sector is the most represented on this list by far with 14 stocks overall and 10 of the worst 11! The only non-Energy stock in the top ten is General Electric (GE), which is down 76% since Trump was elected. Other notable losers include airlines and cruiselines like AAL, CCL, and NCLH, and consumer stocks like TAP, KHC, UAA, WBA, and LB.\n\n&gt; General Electric (GE) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) are the two names that stand out the most. Each of these stocks were at one point in time the largest company in the world, but they're both now shells of their former selves with huge losses over the last four years. Remember these two examples when you're looking at the largest companies in the world right now. Chances are a few of them will experience similar fates as GE and XOM over the next ten to twenty years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/worstsince16.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # News High for Net New Highs\n\n&gt; Yesterday, the S&amp;P 500 closed at its highest level since only a few days after the early September high. While the index has yet to reach a new high, many individual stocks in the index have. As shown in the charts below, 11.71% of S&amp;P 500 stocks closed at a new 52-week high yesterday while no stocks closed at a new 52-week low. That makes for the second-highest net new highs reading of the pandemic with the only higher reading (17.62%) occurring just over a month ago at the last all-time high on September 2nd. Before that, the last time net new highs were as high as now was on February 19th: the last all-time high before the bear market began.\n\n&gt; As for the individual sectors, there has also been a significant pickup in the net percentage of new 52-week highs. Industrials currently has the highest reading of net new highs among the 11 sectors at 26%. Just like the broader S&amp;P 500, that is the highest since September 2nd when the net percentage of new highs rose above 30%. Consumer Discretionary is the runner up in being the sector with the highest percentage of net new highs. One distinguishing factor, though, is whereas every other sector has seen higher readings at some point since the bear market in the spring, Consumer Discretionary's current reading of 18% is tied with the reading from August 24th. On the other end of the spectrum, both Communication Services and the Energy sector have seen no new highs over the past few days. Granted, there have not been any new 52-week lows either. Meanwhile, Financials and Real Estate have both seen an uptick in net new highs, but it has been much more modest than other sectors.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100920-Net-New-Highs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Breadth Booming\n\n&gt; One of the most notable aspects of the rally off the late September lows has been broad participation. As shown below, breadth is very strong as the 10-day advance-decline lines for several sectors are at some of their highest levels of the past year. For the S&amp;P 500, the 10-day advance-decline line is at its highest level since June 8th. The same can be said for Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, Financials, and Real Estate. For Consumer Staples, the sector's 10-day A/D line is at its highest level since June of 2019 and for Health Care it is at its highest level since May of 2019. In the case of Technology, it has been even longer as that sector's line is at its highest level since last April.\n\n&gt; While broad participation is healthy for the long-term prospects of a rally, these 10-Day A/D lines have gotten extremely overbought in the near term, suggesting a cool-down period is likely in the days ahead.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100820-10-day.png))**\n\n&gt; With short term breadth running very hot, the cumulative A/D lines of several sectors are breaking out to new highs as well. Utilities and Materials are the only sectors to have seen prices reach a new high in the past few days alongside their cumulative A/D lines. As for the other sectors, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Health Care, Materials, and Tech have also all seen new highs for cumulative breadth. The same applies to the S&amp;P 500, but again, none of these have yet to see price do the same.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100820-cumulative-ad-f.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Election-Year October Market Performance Volatile since 1950\n\n&gt; October\u2019s history of volatility was recapped in the October Almanac as well as it being the worst performing month of election years since 1950. In the following chart we have plotted election-year October performance for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 since 1950 (NASDAQ since 1972 and Russell indexes since 1980) alongside their historical performance excluding gruesome election-year October 2008.\n\n&gt; With or without October 2008, historical performance has been uninspiring in election years. Excluding 2008, October has generally started off on a positive note, but by around the fourth trading day, strength has tended to fade with weakness persisting until around the eighth trading day. Then a modest rally ensued through mid-month followed by more weakness and finally a rally to end the month.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, October 8, 2020**\n\nStocks rose again today, extending yesterday\u2019s frankly unexpected gains, with the major benchmarks opening at their highest levels in about a month. Market participants digested a new round of jobless claims, dimming hopes of stimulus, even for stand-alone bills, and progress in Covid-19 therapeutics following Pres. Trump\u2019s discharge from the hospital.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.54% up. The S&amp;P (SPY) led the day, up 0.85% and the Dow (DIA) finished 0.48% up. \n\nToday, the Labor Department released their weekly jobless claims report. There were 840,000 additional first-time jobless claims this week, slightly above the 820,000 prediction of analysts. While 840,000 is the lowest level since March, jobless claims have stagnated the past month, a sign of slowing economic recovery. Continuing claims, which are the number of people who have already filed an initial claim and who have experienced a week of unemployment and then filed a continued claim to claim benefits for that week of unemployment, fell below 11 million, dropping almost 1 million compared to the week before. Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said, \u201cThe decline in continuing claims is welcome, but initial claims offer a better read on the real-time state of the labor market, and the downward trend has stalled, more or less.\u201d\n\nAccording to CNBC, there are still 25.5 million workers claiming some form of unemployment benefits, according to totals through Sept. 19. More than half that total, or about 13.4 million, comes from those collecting under pandemic-related programs set up for those who normally wouldn\u2019t be eligible, showing the toll the pandemic has put on the labor market. \n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi further curbed expectations that any form of stimulus will be unleashed before the November election. Today, in response to a bill designed to provide relief to the airline industry, Pelosi said, \u201cThere is no stand-alone bill without a bigger bill.\u201d In other words, she opposes passing smaller, stand-alone stimulus bills in the absence of more comprehensive measures. Yesterday, after calling for his representatives to stop negotiations for overarching stimulus, Pres. Trump signaled he would support a smaller, targeted bill. In response to Trump\u2019s recent tweets about stimulus, Ed Mills, policy analyst at Raymond James said, \u201cIt\u2019s been the question of the day, as to why we got the tweets we got over the last 24 hours, the market reaction we got into \\[Tuesday\u2019s\\] close, and then the rally.\u201d Needless to say, the current market is hyper-responsive to the comments of Trump and other top officials.\n\nShares of Regeneron (REGN) jumped after the drugmaker said it had submitted a request to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency use authorization of its Covid-19 antibody treatment, which had been taken by President Donald Trump after his Covid-19 diagnosis. In a video on Twitter today, Pres. Trump openly endorsed the move saying \u201cI took this medicine \\[during his stay at Walter Reed Hospital\\] and it was incredible.\u201d\n\nIn other nice news, the World Trade Organization (WTO) announced that South Korea\u2019s trade minister and the former Nigerian finance minister are the two finalists in the race to become the next director-general. This is the first time a woman will occupy the position of top leader in this organization. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Covid Relief pushes US deficit to a record $3.1T\n* AMD announced new desktop processors today that the company said will deliver significant improvements in gaming performance. The Ryzen 9 5950X chip delivers what the company described as the \u201chighest single-thread performance of any desktop gaming processor.\u201d\n* Gamestop (GME) announced that it has entered into a multi-year strategic partnership agreement with Microsoft (MSFT) to further advance its strategy to expand its physical and digital video game offerings, as well as enhance the Company\u2019s retail technology infrastructure. GME rocketed up 20% on the announcement.\n* Morgan Stanley (MS) said it is buying fund manager Eaton Vance (EV) Corp. for $7 billion, continuing the Wall Street firm's shift toward safer businesses like money management. The deal comes just days after Morgan Stanley completed its $11 billion takeover of E\\*Trade\n* Weed stocks got a big boost today afet Vice Presidential Candidate Kamala Harris said in yesterday\u2019s debate that the Biden administration would federally decriminalize marijuana. TLRY up 17.5%, CGC up 13%, ACB up 11%, APHA up 10%, CRON 9.6%, and CURLF up 10.5% to name a few of the most popular ones.\n* Square (SQ) bought 4,709 bitcoins (around $50M). The company said \"Square believes that cryptocurrency is an instrument of economic empowerment and provides a way for the world to participate in a global monetary system\"\n* ROKU had a target raised by Needham from $190 to $255.

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 12th, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings could be a positive force for stocks as Washington continues to wrangle over stimulus  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/09/earnings-could-be-a-positive-force-for-stocks-as-washington-continues-to-wrangle-over-stimulus.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stock market optimism for a stimulus package has been rising, but the focus swings to earnings and that could be a positive for stocks in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; JPMorgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley all release earnings in the first big wave of corporate reports. There is also some important data, including CPI inflation data Tuesday and retail sales for September on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt looks like earnings season might turn out better than expected, based on early reports,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cThe guidance looks pretty good. So, we have earnings season upon us, the stimulus talks go back and forth, and it looks like maybe there\u2019s a will to get something done.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; On Friday afternoon, the White House raised its offer for at stimulus package to $1.8 trillion but was still below the $2.2 trillion sought by Democrats. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to read,\u201d said Keon.\n*****\n&gt; But he said even if there\u2019s no agreement on stimulus now, there should be a package after the election, regardless of who wins. \n*****\n&gt; \u201cI actually put some money to work in small caps on the belief if we get further stimulus either soon or a few months from now, you do want to own economically sensitive stocks,\u201d said Keon.\u201cWe\u2019re reasonably constructive on the market and valuations are not cheap, but compared to the 10-year [Treasury yield] at less than 80 basis points, stocks don\u2019t look that bad.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks in the past week had their best performance since early July, with the S&amp;P 500 up 3.8% at 3,477. The small cap Russell 2000 was up 6.4%. The 10-year Treasury yield had a big move during the week from about 0.70% to as high as 0.79% Friday. Yields move opposite price, and the 10-year yield has now broken out of a range its been stuck in below 0.70%.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings could provide positive momentum for stocks, if companies continue to beat estimates at a healthy pace, like last quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cQ2 reporting season saw S&amp;P 500 earnings beat at an unprecedented rate, both in terms of breadth (85%) and size (+20%), prompting historically rare, strong upgrades to forward estimates, especially for the cyclicals, and one of the strongest earnings season rallies on record,\u201d wrote Deutsche Bank strategists.\n*****\n&gt; The summer earnings rally came before the big September decline, which took the S&amp;P 500  down about 10%. The S&amp;P 500 is up more than 8% since Sept. 24.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhile the bottom-up consensus for Q3 is for a sharp rebound in headline earnings, the bulk of it is being driven by reductions in loan loss provisions and Energy sector losses. Excluding these, underlying earnings growth is forecast to barely move up (-15% to -13%), despite rising Q3 GDP growth estimates pointing to a strong macro rebound,\u201d they noted.\n*****\n&gt; The Deutsche strategists said the question remains, however, whether the market will respond to earnings beats or election uncertainty.\n*****\n&gt; Keon said the market has been moving up as former vice president Joe Biden extended his lead in the polls because there\u2019s less chance of an uncertain outlook the more one candidate leads. According to RealClearPolitics, he was leading President Donald Trump by 9.7 percentage points, from just about  6 points at the beginning of the prior week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think from the market\u2019s perspective, it doesn\u2019t really matter who wins, as long as we have a clear winner,\u201d said Keon. \u201cI think the direction of the polls are suggesting that we\u2019re going to have a clear winner either on election night or a few days after that. The risk of a messy contested election is going down, and the market is relieved by that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Tom Block, Washington analyst at Fundstrat, said Trump appears to be hoping for a stimulus bill signing before the election to help his re-election effort.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere are many moving parts here, and they\u2019re all moving in different directions,\u201d said Block. \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible a deal comes together but the pathway to a deal is not clear on Friday afternoon because of the mixed signals that have come out over the last seven days from the White House.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has opposed a large package, and the two sides have been stalemated. \u201cI think the president believes that he will be helped by having a signed ceremony at the White House approving the bill, that the optics of signing the bill that\u2019s going to send relief to people is an optic he desperately wants, and it can\u2019t hurt,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The economic recovery is going on in the background, and some parts of the economy have shown real improvement, like housing.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales on Friday is a good look at how the consumer has been faring, now that enhanced unemployment benefits have been gone for the past two months. Economists expect 0.6% gain in retail sales, the same as August.\n*****\n&gt; Keon said it is important to get some more help for the economy through stimulus. There is expected to be one-time payments to individuals and enhanced employment benefits.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat would be good news for the market, if we could get more help where it is needed. We really just need to get a bridge for a more normal circumstances next year,\u201d said Keon.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/4K1MVFr.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TogcA3z.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/LSeLvCN.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/ksFc8um.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xCRPIpj.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pbYmOWI.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/U3OyIJ0.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qnhClbM.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ow0caWu.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/nznrtfX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/bm1ckAt.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Ten-Baggers Under Trump\n\n&gt; In our prior post we looked at the best and worst performing S&amp;P 500 stocks since Election Day 2016. In this post we've broadened our filter and looked at the Russell 3,000, which is an index that covers more than 98% of all publicly traded market cap in the US. Within the Russell 3,000, there are 32 stocks that are up more than 1,000% since Trump was elected. These 32 \"ten-baggers\" -- as Peter Lynch liked to call them -- are listed in the table below.\n\n&gt; At the top of the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH), which is up 8,892% since Election Day 2016. While Enphase has \"Energy\" in its company name, it's actually a Technology sector stock that \"manufactures software-driven home energy solutions that span solar generation, home energy storage and web-based monitoring and control.\" Next up is Zynex (ZYXI) with a gain of 7,211%, followed by Digital Turbine (APPS) up 5,320%. ZYXI markets itself as a \"better and safer way to manage pain\" than opiods using electrotherapy devices. APPS is an app marketing company that helps app developers get their product on as many devices as possible.\n\n&gt; Of the 16 best performing Russell 3,000 stocks since Election Day 2016, 15 come from either the Technology or Health Care sectors. XPEL is the only stock in the top ten that's not in either the Tech or Health Care sectors. Up 2,341% since Trump was elected, XPEL is a Consumer Discretionary stock whose main product is to provide auto-paint protection.\n\n&gt; Along with the names mentioned already, other notables on the list of ten-baggers under Trump include Jack Dorsey's Square (SQ), pet-food maker Freshpet (FRPT), digital health company Teladoc (TDOC), the arts and crafts social media company Etsy (ETSY), and of course, Tesla (TSLA). With a gain of 1,002% since November 8th, 2016, Tesla just barely makes the cut!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/tenbaggers.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best Performing Stocks Since Election Day 2016\n\n&gt; On Monday we published our asset class performance matrix showing total returns for key ETFs since Election Day 2016 (11/8/16). Today we wanted to highlight the individual stocks traded on US exchanges that have performed the best and the worst since President Trump surprised the world with a victory over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. First off, below is a chart showing the average performance of stocks in each S&amp;P 500 sector since Election Day 2016. (These are based on stocks currently in the index and not as the index stood on 11/8/16.)\n\n&gt; As shown, the average stock in the broad S&amp;P 500 is up 67.3% since Trump was elected. Four sectors have posted stronger average returns than that -- Technology (+160.4%), Health Care (+100.3%), Consumer Discretionary (+74.6%), and Industrials (+69.9%).\n\n&gt; The Energy sector stands out like a sore thumb in the chart below. While every other sector has at least averaged double-digit percentage gains, the stocks in the Energy sector are down an average of 52.3% since Trump was elected! Other sectors that have been weaker than the broad market include Real Estate, Consumer Staples, and Financials.\n\n&gt; If you were to ask most people back in November 2016 which areas of the market should outperform under Trump and which should underperform, you'd likely see results that are the exact opposite of what has actually happened. Sectors like Energy, Real Estate, and Financials would have been expected to benefit from Trump since those are the industries he's most associated with, while Tech is a sector that's usually expected to benefit more when the Democratic party is in control.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/avgsector.png))**\n\n&gt; Looking at individual stocks, below we show the 46 stocks currently in the S&amp;P 500 that are up at least 200% since Election Day 2016. Two stocks -- Etsy (ETSY) and Advanced Micro (AMD) -- have been \"10-baggers\" with gains of more than 1,000%, while another three -- Paycom (PAYC), NVIDIA (NVDA) and DexCom (DXCM) -- are up more than 500%. Other names on the list are a who's who of the most popular stocks over the past few years, including Adobe (ADBE), Netflix (NFLX), Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), salesforce.com (CRM), and PayPal (PYPL).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/bestsince16.png))**\n\n&gt; While there are 46 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 up more than 200% since Election Day 2016, there are 32 stocks that are down more than 50% over the same time frame. The Energy sector is the most represented on this list by far with 14 stocks overall and 10 of the worst 11! The only non-Energy stock in the top ten is General Electric (GE), which is down 76% since Trump was elected. Other notable losers include airlines and cruiselines like AAL, CCL, and NCLH, and consumer stocks like TAP, KHC, UAA, WBA, and LB.\n\n&gt; General Electric (GE) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) are the two names that stand out the most. Each of these stocks were at one point in time the largest company in the world, but they're both now shells of their former selves with huge losses over the last four years. Remember these two examples when you're looking at the largest companies in the world right now. Chances are a few of them will experience similar fates as GE and XOM over the next ten to twenty years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/worstsince16.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # News High for Net New Highs\n\n&gt; Yesterday, the S&amp;P 500 closed at its highest level since only a few days after the early September high. While the index has yet to reach a new high, many individual stocks in the index have. As shown in the charts below, 11.71% of S&amp;P 500 stocks closed at a new 52-week high yesterday while no stocks closed at a new 52-week low. That makes for the second-highest net new highs reading of the pandemic with the only higher reading (17.62%) occurring just over a month ago at the last all-time high on September 2nd. Before that, the last time net new highs were as high as now was on February 19th: the last all-time high before the bear market began.\n\n&gt; As for the individual sectors, there has also been a significant pickup in the net percentage of new 52-week highs. Industrials currently has the highest reading of net new highs among the 11 sectors at 26%. Just like the broader S&amp;P 500, that is the highest since September 2nd when the net percentage of new highs rose above 30%. Consumer Discretionary is the runner up in being the sector with the highest percentage of net new highs. One distinguishing factor, though, is whereas every other sector has seen higher readings at some point since the bear market in the spring, Consumer Discretionary's current reading of 18% is tied with the reading from August 24th. On the other end of the spectrum, both Communication Services and the Energy sector have seen no new highs over the past few days. Granted, there have not been any new 52-week lows either. Meanwhile, Financials and Real Estate have both seen an uptick in net new highs, but it has been much more modest than other sectors.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100920-Net-New-Highs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Breadth Booming\n\n&gt; One of the most notable aspects of the rally off the late September lows has been broad participation. As shown below, breadth is very strong as the 10-day advance-decline lines for several sectors are at some of their highest levels of the past year. For the S&amp;P 500, the 10-day advance-decline line is at its highest level since June 8th. The same can be said for Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, Financials, and Real Estate. For Consumer Staples, the sector's 10-day A/D line is at its highest level since June of 2019 and for Health Care it is at its highest level since May of 2019. In the case of Technology, it has been even longer as that sector's line is at its highest level since last April.\n\n&gt; While broad participation is healthy for the long-term prospects of a rally, these 10-Day A/D lines have gotten extremely overbought in the near term, suggesting a cool-down period is likely in the days ahead.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100820-10-day.png))**\n\n&gt; With short term breadth running very hot, the cumulative A/D lines of several sectors are breaking out to new highs as well. Utilities and Materials are the only sectors to have seen prices reach a new high in the past few days alongside their cumulative A/D lines. As for the other sectors, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Health Care, Materials, and Tech have also all seen new highs for cumulative breadth. The same applies to the S&amp;P 500, but again, none of these have yet to see price do the same.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100820-cumulative-ad-f.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Election-Year October Market Performance Volatile since 1950\n\n&gt; October\u2019s history of volatility was recapped in the October Almanac as well as it being the worst performing month of election years since 1950. In the following chart we have plotted election-year October performance for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 since 1950 (NASDAQ since 1972 and Russell indexes since 1980) alongside their historical performance excluding gruesome election-year October 2008.\n\n&gt; With or without October 2008, historical performance has been uninspiring in election years. Excluding 2008, October has generally started off on a positive note, but by around the fourth trading day, strength has tended to fade with weakness persisting until around the eighth trading day. Then a modest rally ensued through mid-month followed by more weakness and finally a rally to end the month. Grey shading highlights the two historical windows of weakness that could setup our Seasonal MACD indicators.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/9deab1b6431375946cf0104830334e3a/1b58acd0d015098f-cf/s500x750/1a07b8cea97519bcce57adae974614a0e426effb.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 9th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fw7sXu8pcPw))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.4.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/IIowf1B.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.12.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.13.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2lSi1kT.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Wj80iaX.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.14.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZY9TwgO.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/5LizPLJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.15.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oIstn4O.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uKfmmCC.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Q3isONG.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.16.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Swqo1ow.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket.",

I am 20, relatively risk-tolerant, and I am looking to invest a few thousand dollars to start. I plan to hold for at least 5 years. Are there any stocks in this list that seem particularly interesting to you? As a young person, Paypal (and Venmo which it owns) seems to have become a bit of a staple in my generation's life. I am seeing more and more people get Venmo cards as people seem to be putting off credit cards as there is already enough debt to worry about when it comes to the cost of college. Anyway, I would love to know your thoughts on them! \n\n1. PYPL ------&gt;\n2. SPGI ------ &gt;\n3. NVDA -----&gt;\n4. AVGO -----&gt;\n5. ABBV ------&gt;\n6. NKE -------&gt;",

        "selftext": "Initiative Q is an attempt by ex-PayPal guys to create a new payment system instead of payment cards that were designed in the 1950s. The system uses its own currency, the Q, and to get people to start using the system once it's ready they are allocating Qs for free to people that sign up now (the amount drops as more people join - so better to join early). Signing up is free and they only ask for your name and an email address. There's nothing to lose but if this payment system becomes a world leading payment method your Qs can be worth a lot.

You can see this inPaypal, Visa, and Square right now.\n\nThis is partially lead to SQ reaching all time highs and Paypal and Visa to be close as well. Even though in contact payments from SQ is down, they have converted successfully via cashapp to online movements.\n\nLooking at some flow, look at $SQ\u2019s run on Friday:\nhttps://gyazo.com/1eb2621dfb91c6e1e72b6380464e48cf\n\nThis is despite the news of a wavering stimulus. In fact, it looks like option flow is heading that way on [these payment providers](https://twitter.com/unusual_whales/status/1311683758735597569) with big movements happening earlier this month in anticipation of the stimulus.\n\nPaypal and Visa are looking a little beat up in comparison, but I think the flow will hit them too. I suspect Monday/Tuesday we get a lot of talk about the stimulus after the weekend and Trump\u2019s Friday offers. Plus pressure from the populace to make a deal happen.\n\nI am bullish on all payment companies as a result. What do you guys think?",

        "selftext": "LONDON \u2014 PayPal says it\u2019s launching a \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d service in the U.K. that lets shoppers finance their purchases over three interest-free monthly instalments.\n\nThe U.S. tech giant is perhaps better known for its online payment tools, but it\u2019s been branching out into credit in the years since it acquired lending platform Bill Me Later.\n\nNow, the company is taking on the likes of Sweden\u2019s Klarna and Australia\u2019s Afterpay, whose point-of-sale loans have increased in popularity recently. It rolled out its \u201cPay in 4\u201d product in the U.S. just last month and is now following up with a separate offering for the U.K. called \u201cPay in 3.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen over last 6 months or so is a significant rise in the shift from physical to digital transactions across the whole of the U.K. retail base,\u201d Rob Harper, PayPal\u2019s U.K. director of enterprise accounts, told CNBC in an interview.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also seen the rise of buy now, pay later solutions in the market; brands like Klarna, but also smaller brands that are entering into the market that are not as recognizable as PayPal.\u201d\n\nEurope\u2019s Top Fintech Unicorn: Klarna CEO on $10.6 billion valuation, fundraising mega-round\nPayPal is betting that brand recognition will give it an edge over competing services like Klarna, Clearpay and Laybuy. The company has grown customer accounts by 300% year-on-year in the second quarter and now has more than 24 million active users in the U.K., dwarfing Klarna\u2019s almost 10 million customers in the country.\n\nIn the U.K., PayPal\u2019s new product will offer three-month instalment plans for purchases of between \u00a345 and \u00a32,000. It\u2019s signed up a number of British retailers to offer the service, including Crew Clothing, French Connection, Robert Dyas and Ryman.\n\nHarper said the \u201cPay in 3\u201d option was chosen as Brits get paid monthly, as opposed to Americans who usually get their paychecks once a fortnight. He added that PayPal was a \u201cresponsible lender\u201d and would run \u201caffordability checks\u201d on transactions.\n\nThe move comes amid calls to regulate the fast-growing \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d sector, with some critics concerned it could lead younger shoppers into a debt trap. But PayPal, Klarna and other such firms claim they have sufficient safeguards in place to prevent overspending.\n\n[Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/13/paypal-takes-aim-at-klarna-with-pay-in-3-service-for-uk-shoppers-.html)",
