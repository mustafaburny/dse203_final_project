Market is gapping down, No stocks with individual catalyst. I mentioned yesterday the weekly 200 MA over head could act as resistance. Now well see if the market continues lower. Next support level, last low on SPY at 218. level. Things might be a bit choppy today so be patient and wait for solid patterns before entering trades. Good luck",
