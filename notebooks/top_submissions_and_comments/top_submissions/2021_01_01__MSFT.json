        "selftext": "I get it, it\u2019s not the play. I\u2019m not saying sell your GME. I\u2019m not a bot or a spy or a wall street asshole. I\u2019m a regular guy who\u2019s got a couple of bucks in his bank account and plays videogames and wants a fucking house to live in like my parents had when they were young. If you don\u2019t agree with me, just say so. \n\nI\u2019m also not a financial advisor, so make up your own minds you autistic fucks. \n\nBut, BUT, yesterday we did something they\u2019ve never seen. Yesterday, we made them run out of NOK shares. That\u2019s what that big spike was, and that\u2019s why trading was stopped for 2h. If we keep doing that, it will be the biggest wall street wealth transfer from assholes to retards in history. Because they will keep dumping it until it\u2019s too late. \n\nImpossible, you say. Too many shares, you say. Well listen up. Yesterday, in ONE DAY, we traded, or caused others to trade, 1bn shares of Nokia. That is 1/5 of all the Nokia shares in the world. That\u2019s never happened, *EVER*. Not even when Nokia was the biggest phone company in the world. \n\n3516.16% of average trading volume. \n\nDo you get it? They\u2019ll keep dumping their stock, we keep buying them cheap, and then they won\u2019t be so cheap anymore when they try to buy back in. We can move 1bn shares IN A DAY. ONE DAY. \n\nWhy do they stop trading in NYSE? Cos they ran out of shares temporarily and they don\u2019t want \u201cartificial\u201d spikes in the prices. So they made us retards wait a couple of hours while some assholes called some other assholes to unload their shares into the market, and once they had enough, they started again. That\u2019s why that spike went down right after the freeze.\n\nBut then we did it again. And they had to stop again. The price just wouldn\u2019t go down. The assholes who\u2019d just unloaded shares were probably back on the phone with the other assholes who\u2019d convinced them. \n\nEveryone is watching us. What we do, millions of normal folks do with us, and every wallstreet asshole does against us.\n\nWhat did the asshole brigade do? They started shorting NOK. They will continue to do that, because they think we\u2019re retards (they are correct). \n\nBut how come the price didn\u2019t go down? It\u2019s got 5bn shares, and everyone whos ever held it was dumping it. How could we ever keep up the demand when there are so many shares out there? How is this going to work?\n\nBecause the retard brigade was buying it. There\u2019s 3m of us and counting. If we each put 600 bucks on NOK, we get 100 shares, and that\u2019s 300m shares. \n\nNow imagine what happens if we put 6000 on it. AND. FUCKING. HOLD. And every dip you see, you buy more. AND. FUCKING. HOLD. They'll keep dumping, we keep buying, until they realize the price isn't going down. Then they start buying, we keep holding, the market runs out of NOK. Price skyrockets. \n\nAnd normies outside were following us. They can see that the stock is still LOW, lower than 2016. This means they don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bubble that\u2019s going to crash on them. \n\nSo why do the normies follow us on this, and not on GME? (I\u2019m not saying sell GME). \n\nBecause GME has never, ever been anywhere near where it is now. That scares a normal guy who\u2019s just trying to put in some savings for his family. They think this is some Dutch tulip market shit.\n\nNot so with NOK. Even with the spike from yesterday, NOK is still *DOWN* from 2016. Remember 2016? Remember that being a really big year for Nokia? No, me neither. And let\u2019s not even get started on where it has been in the past. Yesterday's spike barely shows on the graph.\n\nYou know what is going to be a big year? 2021 and 2022. Why? \n\nWhat else did NOK say yesterday? Well, they revealed that they have a new kind of 1 terabit data transfer networks shit, what do I know, I\u2019m not a techie. But it IS a new kind of technology that\u2019s going to kick 5Gs ass. And my fellow retards of the most honorable retard brigade \u2013 Do you think we\u2019re going to need more data this year than last year? \n\nRemember how Netflix had to downgrade its picture quality in March because the networks couldn\u2019t handle the amount people were streaming? What do you think is going to happen with the company that solves that?\n\nBut why would NOK be the company? Well, remember the 5G war with China?   \n\n\nUS and Europe can\u2019t buy 5G from China, because then China has our networks. But guess who US and Europe aren\u2019t afraid of? Fucking FINLAND. Finland, the land of NOKIA. So tiny that some people think the whole country is a conspiracy theory and doesn\u2019t really exist. Sorry Finnish people, nobody gives a shit about you. Good thing for you, cos you get to build the 5G network on the moon and shit because nobody is scared that Finland will take over the world.\n\nWant proof? They are literally building one on the FUCKING MOON: [https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/)\n\nAnd we\u2019re going to send them there.\n\nBut hang on, why is NOK so low in the first place if it\u2019s so great?\n\nAnswer: because Microsoft fucked them. That\u2019s right, they sent one of their own assholes to infiltrate the NOK, leak a bunch shit to drive the share price down, and then buy the phone part of the company. These assholes wrecked the company, the Finnish economy, and every middle class shareholder who was just trying to put their kids to college. Imagine everyone who\u2019d be fucked if someone did that to Apple now. \n\nWorked like a charm. Firesale. Business restructuring. Lost their phones. NOK never recovered. \n\nThe asshole they sent from Microsoft? Went back to work for Microsoft, and was paid a shit ton of money for what he did. His name is Stephen Elop. Look it up. \n\nSo they have tech that nobody else has and a brand that everyone recognizes. But what don\u2019t they have? Money. That\u2019s why they\u2019re building this 1tb magic network thing in tiny fucking possibly fake Finland to show everyone it works. \n\nBut if we drive the share price up, do you think that\u2019s going to change? \n\nSo FUCK IT. I\u2019m in for every penny, and I am HOLDING. I\u2019ll see you in my house ON the MOON next to a NOKIA Comms tower, or I\u2019ll see you in VALHALLA you BEAUTIFUL RETARDED MOTHERFUCKERS.   \n\n\nTL;DR: NOK is literally going to the moon. Go there with them.",

        "selftext": "# Ok retards listen up. Been seeing lots of cucks writing small DD pieces of bullish or bearish shit. You cucks need to read this cos this is the whole fucking thing.\n\nthis is also basically my magnum fucking opus so upvote retards. Dont give me awards, legit go buy a powerup membership for a year. Cant tell you to buy shares because we gonna get closed down by Suck Elons Cock somehow.\n\nim also not some fininacial advisor or whatever just read this and make your own conclusions degenerates.\n\nTLDR: GME DD sumarized, Margin doesnt affect longs the same way as shorts right now. Dont buy shares on margin though and get ready to supply collateral regardless. Short interest is up and some smart retards are on our side. Read the post to raise your IQ from 8 to 9 though. **\ud83d\udc3b \ud83c\udf08s  mega fuk and even posting high level bear shit to scare us.**\n\nCompulsory 7 rockets so you autists dont start having a seizure or something:\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nBasically been seeing posts about \"blah blah margin this, short interest this, WS to clever blah\". Going to split this post into distinct sections but im no english degree cuck so dont expect any bear bloomberg  level shit or something\n\n# 1. GME is a fucking steal regardless of squeeze. Buy now or be left on a dying planet while we head to alpha fucking centauri.\n\nSo basically everyone here knows about Ryan cohen and his horsemen of the apocalypse coming to steal melvins lunch money. This man bought apple stock in 2017. Hes fucking rich. Hes also an eccommerce wizard, taking CHEWY from a measly 100k co-founded company to a $4 Billion company in 2017 at which point he sold it to petsmart or something. Its now valued at $40 Billion, granted anything eccommerce now gets money thrown at it like a stripper in a high flying strip club or some shit idk im a virgin so dont listen to me, so it may well be a bubble. Regardless the thing grows its revenue like bacteria doing mitosis on agar jelly \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.\n\nTHEY SELL FUCKING PET FOOD. the market for that is like what? $1?. Gaming is going to the moon and is basically recession proof because of how cheap game is compared to other things for how much you get out of it. Any bears saying that Gamestop cant compete with digital or with amazon. Ryan cohen already slapped amazons head in with a no name brand. Hell fucking do it again. About digital everyone here already knows, microsoft deal, Ryan cohen also mentioned the possibility of having \"Digital game exchanging\" or something, image below.\n\n*Processing img 2ba9j5d2zvb61...*\n\nHe also mentions streaming, digital content etc and aside from all the digital stuff wants GME to move to a community centric structure where big stores operate with VR centres, Internet cafe, table games like Dungeons and dragons and  40k (rapidly growing somehow will boom post covid) and as we now might know due to this post:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme\\_dd\\_buildapc\\_kiosks\\_coming/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme_dd_buildapc_kiosks_coming/)\n\nBUILD YOUR OWN PC KIOSKS. This is the literal smell of money. Go to your Gamestop to build your PC with your kid? Gamestop is already the goto place wher your parents go to get you your latest digital fix so now they can go build PC's and it cant go tits up?\n\n**Now for some pussy boomer talk (aka fundametals or something).**\n\nThe expected Q3 EPS was -0.84$ or something close to that. The actual loss was -0.53$ but boomzoids only talked about the revenue drop. No shit sherlock its closing all its dead weight stores.\n\nIn the holiday report I will talk about a bit more below, 11% of stores were closed and revenue dropped only 3%. Comparitive store sales increased nearly 5%. They cant get enough consoles to sell so expect the momentum to carry on for the whole year I expect. Eccommerce is up 300% over holidays. In Q3 they reported 800% to date. In 2020 Gamestops eccomerce went up 24x. YES YOU READ THAT RIGHT. Online sales now account for \\~33% of Gamestops sales now. This is literally gold dust for ryan cohen.\n\nWe are still trading at 0.38 P/S at this price. The average P/S for the SP500 is 2.753. Massive upside on these two numbers alone.\n\nBurry got in this for the MOASS and the intrinsic value. At the time intrinsic value was like $22 and this will pump up as RC takes it to new heights.\n\nGME in Q3 somehow halved the expected loss. Big Bad Boomer sherman somehow didnt fuck it up that bad by saying \"omnichannel\" at the speed of light. Yes the revenue dropped 30% but thats covid for you. As the PC kiosk post above shows GME now sells small items basically so fast they have to have fake stock lmao. The new console cycle always spikes the share price sky high too, as youll see in a crayon drawing later. The potential revenue that this console cycle brings in could be huge. Biggest ever is potentially a true statement and Gamestop sells every fucker they get. Combine the fact that they share game pass ( a massive hit) revenue from the xboxes they sell, something no other retailer has, revenue could be sky high.\n\nNow I know you autists are starting to develop short term dyslexia or something but keep reading. This could be the most important piece of shit you read in your life. How do you think I feel? My brains overheating just trying to write coherent sentences.\n\nHoldiay report was a bear trap imo, saw people saying the decrease in revenue was bearish blah blah blah. Lies. Comparitve store sales rose 5% and thats with some towns having like 4 gamestops. When the leases dont get renewed and these stores get liquidated (Also in Ryan cohens letter) they can just get this influx of cash and pay down debt and invest in logistics and marketing and new growth. Gamestop realistically needs like 1/2 the stores they have now and just need to improve efficiency. \n\n[https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349890](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349890) this article the messiah himself wrote. In it he states:\n\n&gt;At Chewy, we had maniacal discipline when it came to how we spent money. The company-wide culture of frugality came from his example. Free cash flow was our unwavering governor of growth. We grew Chewy from $200 million in sales in 2013 to $3.5 billion in 2018 while spending only $130 million in capital, all of which went into opening distribution centers across the country and acquiring new customers.\n\nManiacal. Thats all I need to say. The guy is going to get to mars before papa musk and he wont even break a sweat. When FCF starts to catch up to WS expectations every cuck analyst who donwgraded them is gonna get ditched and upgrades will start to happen.\n\nSo in the headin i said its a steal. That implies some future higher price target right? Well here is my guess for a conservative price target based on the information above and also some more I probably forgot cos im a retard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The difference is where share price looks to be and where market cap places us is due to difference in outstanding shares \\(another reason shorts are fuk\\)](https://preview.redd.it/dehiug393wb61.png?width=1552&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f198773c36d5109382eb2beba6fade3c059121df)\n\n&gt;The difference is where share price looks to be and where market cap places us is due to difference in outstanding shares (another reason shorts are fuk)\n\nThis alone means if for not inflation adjusted terms we reached 9.8Bn or whatever the crayon chart says we should reach:\n\n9.8/2.48 = \\~3.95   3.95 \\* $35.5 = \\~$140. The share price now to reach old mkt cap is $140 fucking dollars. Thats a 4 bagger from now. It gets better. \n\nfrom [statista](https://statista.com) :\n\n&gt;Considering the **annual inflation rate in the United States** in recent years, a 2.24 percent **inflation rate** is a very moderate projection.\n\nIf we take 2.24% inflation, the this share price target in todays money means we should reach $182 because of $140 \\* 1.0224\\^12, = $182 in adjusted. Thats more than a 5 bagger. basically we could see $10 GME price from short manipulation and buying more is basically a lottery ticket!\n\nI really dont understand the bear thesis. The only bear thesis ( short term this one) was that margin would affect longs more but I looked at it on ortex and its basically bullshit. Buy shares with cash though dont use margin. Own your piece of GME dont borrow it. Bears just spout \"DigITaL\" or \"BlOCKbuSTER\" so much Ryan tweeted a shit emoji at them. All the bears think theyre clever. What the fuck makes those cucks special? How are they different now than the ones from $2, or $4, or $10. \n\n**Bears are betting against:**\n\nRyan fucking cohen, buisness legend CHEWY from 100k investment, now 40 billion\n\nMichael burry, Investing legend, predicted the housing crisis and is in GME since april\n\nu/DeepFuckingValue , the new WSB god chad, now basically a whale\n\nReggie Fils-Aim\u00e9, gaming and buisness legend, former COO of nintendo\n\nSenvest, a mega fund thats actively managed\n\nNorweigan sovereign wealth fund\n\nFidelity, Vanguard and blackrock own this shit and are never selling they literally dont give a shit\n\nAll of WSB has now formed a shield wall against the bears\n\nMicrosoft gave GME highly discounted azure deals and free office use for all employees and a revenue sharing agreement. Bears are stupid if they think MSFT didnt vet GME.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome valid bear thesis left now (the only ones left) ----&gt; Ryan Cohen dies.\n\n# 2. Now some analysis on the short squeeze and some technical data on puts and calls and ortex data.\n\nOk everyone on here and their cat, dog, bedbugs and wifes boyfriend  knows about the squeeze. Jimmy chill aka cramer even talking about it. Gamestop is literally the most shorted stock of all time and space. The squeeze makes every autist salivate because its basically free money while cucking big money out of like what 1% of their fund.\n\nAlthough I know all you cucks hate shares, and hate holding, if the squeeze doesnt happen selling is probably the most retarded thing anyone could do. Its literally buy high sell low and you fucking disgust me. STONK ONLY GOES UP.\n\nThis squeeze is so monumental that its been sucking sharks in like fresh blood. Most of the funds where shorting this from 30-15 dollars before this year so they didnt really care. It all changed with 2 people. u/DeepFuckingValue and Dr. Michael Burry. These guys are as OG as it gets with GME. I think u/DeepFuckingValue may have even sniffed this trade out before the legend himself. Since then funds will have churned this through their rules and started jumping on this train. Ive been in since $13 with 125 shares. If I had more money Id be buying but im just some stupid student ok. Im merely a medium for this money made information.\n\n**The stats for this stock now short wise are, from ortex:**\n\n*Concrete* short interest as of 31 December 2020: **71 Million**.\n\n*Estimated* short interest, *January 11th data:* (This isnt predicted, this is from data in flow, has margin of error) : **77 Million**\n\nShort shares on loan 7 days ago: **50 Million**\n\nShort shares on loan *now* (This breaks the bearish margin calls affect longs more thesis): 54.2 Million\n\n% of known float short: **147%** as of 31 December 2020\n\n% of know free float on loaned shorts: **108%** as of January 11th.\n\nSome [guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyocql/updated_potential_holdings_of_gme/) on here took into account extra buying on wednesday, Institutions, Burry, RC's extra 7% and WSB ownership (something so stupendously  retarded no serious firm will do it) that float on short could be in the 100s of %. Total short float now I would say could be **200-400%** if the numbers are correct.  This pisses on all other short squeezes. Some countries ban shorting above 100% cos of how autistic it is.\n\nThe recent hike in interactive brokers available shares is probably a mix of sell off on friday (remember  some guys are now buying lambos with GME money. If they held they could by 10), calls exercising and puts being covered and brokers ditching the shares. Nakedshort even reported 5 million naked GME shorts on friday. This is bullish as fuck because the best the shorts could do on a red market day was **-10%**.\n\nGamestop is still on the SECs threshold list for 27 days now.\n\n*Processing img xsetax08pwb61...*\n\nNeed rockets \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80:\n\nOk so now if WSB owns an estimated 6-8% of the stock and we all know to move over to cash accounts now to avoid margin calls, we should be minimizing longs getting margin called. Every bear on stockwits is a clueless cuck who spouts \"blockbuster\" and these guys dont even know what margin even is so my bet is the colossal **54 Million** shares short on loan are gonna be affected by the margin calls more. Why? Because every long on margin is in the green, and now a true zealot/extremist/autist for ryan cohen so will supply their account with collateral to avoid margin call. Shorts are in the massive red zone. How do I know you ask?\n\nOrtex data from Jan 4th 2021:\n\n*Processing img urqb3c3zbwb61...*\n\nSo this shows for jan 4th the estimated short interest is 66.98 Million shares. From the exchange reported 71 Million on december 31st this makes a lot of sense because the share price fell from \\~21 to \\~17 so shorts took profits. The shares on loan arent for longs too. This is all purely short data, and 47M  shorted at $17 this shows.\n\nThese shorts are in a circle of hell we cant comprehend and makes satan scared.\n\nNow for the data for this week:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Ortex short data for Jan 14th for Gamestop](https://preview.redd.it/5ryumpl1dwb61.png?width=1152&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb80c09e1be7b2f36f6d3745983cef4ce2b2df9b)\n\nSHARES ON LOAN HAVE GONE UP.  BUT 87% OF LOANED SHORTS WHERE SHORTING AT SUB $20. \n\nCost to borrow is also up, estimated short interest is up to a cataclysmic amount.\n\nLongs on margin need to supply collateral, but we are in the massive green zone, shorts are underwater. Margin calls will ravage the shorts and sting the longs. We also have the uptick rule in place until the end of the day, so shorts can only short on the way up. Im not saying itll happen but this shit is skewed in our favour big time. we need to \ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/).\n\n**Seen a lot of talk about Gamma hedging and delta.**\n\nYou realize that the fucking bankers and brokers dont understand gamma hedging right? That shits up their with the black-scholes equation and feynman-kac solution. Forget about it. The retards claiming to understand it are either payed by hedge funds or lose money. The guy who took out outs thinking options exercising and gamma hedging would lead to a collossal sell off on friday lost money on his puts because **no one** except some quants in a goldman sachs server room know this shit. The idea is simple about neutral delta on options that people take out, but the simple system interacts with every other thing in the stock market, and wow who couldve guessed it, like nearly any other element of the stock market predicting something by the day is nigh impossible. That guy talking about Gamma , Delta and margin calls is on weeklies. Hes no more autistic and equally retarded as all of us. Hes a chill guy though so dont berate a fellow brother.\n\n**Now weve established the likelihood of longs getting margin called is far smaller than shorts, on to the options distributions**\n\n**Two images now: Top one is before the end of the 15th, the other one is after market close:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img t8odq9btgwb61...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 3nqb33f0hwb61...*\n\nThese two graphs, show before market close and after. As we can see the massiver 51000 put contracts didnt get rolled over and the chances that those were melvins july puts rolled up is very high. They expired worthless. Lots of calls are printing big time while huge amounts of puts are worthless and bleeding money.\n\nSomething else we can extrapolate from the charts is that massive options trades are not present on the scale we saw before (tens of thousands).\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \n\nWe are seeing a discrepancy in the number of puts/calls opening up at the higher prices with calls gaining fast. This could show that some funds are now becoming optimistic on the long or short term prospects of gamestop. There are also more puts than options and if we assume this for shorts vs longs on margin (without even taking into account that all shorts are borrowed shares and pay interest further bleeding cash) then shorts are likely on more margin than longs.\n\nRegardless fellow autists my main point is two show that the bears are underwater and the bulls are flying high with regards to options.\n\n**Now lets compare this possible squeeze with others.**\n\nBear in mind this is the most shorted stock of all time, but differences in free float change the share price differently.\n\nKodak went from **$2.16 to $33.2**\n\nVolkswagen went from **\\~200 euro to nearly 1000.**\n\nOverstock went from **\\~$21 to $123**\n\nBlue apron went from **$2.31 to $18** \n\nIve been seeing some estimated that 1 million shares is roughly a dollars move in share price. This maths is about to be pretty autistic so bear with me degnerates.\n\n$1 now is 2.81% of the share price. Everything in the markets is exponential and based on percentages. So if we assume a full squeeze of ortexs estimated short interest (This assumes no sell off and no new shorts, new shorts can be positive or negative depedning on when in the squeeze they happen) **$35.5 \\* 1.0281\\^77 = $299.** GME to moon. \ud83c\udf11 .\n\nThis shit can happen. Hold on.\n\n**GME has squeezed and been manipulated before and it always happens around the console cycles. Shorts never win and they wont win now.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 4ysv7bzclwb61...*\n\nBasically the crayon chart shows green (outstanding shares) orange ( short shares) purple (Market cap) and cyan (Share price). In 2006-2008 the share price rose in tandem with short interest ( Like now ) Until console releases when you can see an abrupt squeeze happend mooning the share price. \n\nThis happend to a degree in 2013 with the xbox one but worse conditions for the company and a worse console launch lead to slow short covering but the share price still mooned.\n\nNow we get to the best part. History is repeating itself for the third time and the shares sold short are literally higher than the outstanding shares, which have been decreasing since 2010. Short shares are also at the highest point ever and GME hasnt had a brighter future, well ever. Ps5 and Xbox Series X. are the two most hyped consoles since the Ps2. This is setting up the foundations for massive price movements weve never seen before. This shit has literally never happend, ever. Uncharted waters and we are the captain.\n\n**For the insurmountably retarded autists who think that the squeeze has happend look upon this and despair:**\n\n[**https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwpf6k/gme\\_gang\\_there\\_hasnt\\_been\\_a\\_short\\_squeeze\\_yet/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwpf6k/gme_gang_there_hasnt_been_a_short_squeeze_yet/)\n\nIHOR IS A MEGA WIZARD\n\nIhor I quote:\n\n&gt;**A long-buying tsunami ... is the primary factor for the price move**\n\nIhor Dusaniwsky is managing director of predictive analytics at S3 a firm similar to ortex. He told bloomberg that the squeeze hasnt happend yet and that this was long buying. If someone knows this shit its him. He was talking about the tesla squeeze in january 2020. He has access to resources we can only imagine. Barrons cut his comment that the squeeze hasnt happend yet out it was that fucking bullish. All the media ramming down \"Short squeeze has happend\" down peoples throats because bears are fucking scared.\n\nThe bots on stocktwits spamming bearish sentiment should show how rattled they are.\n\n**Conclusion: Buy shares with cash not margin. Hold shares forever unless RC dies (Shame hes a cybernetic demigod), Melvin bad, Shorts fuk, \ud83d\udc3b \ud83c\udf08  posting bearish shit are doing weeklies for the second time after they expired red on friday, GME to $200 without squeeze, Ryan cohen a god, GME is still a value play, Good luck have fun.**",

        "selftext": "Gamestonk. Gamestop. GME. My thoughts are on Reddit, under my u/martinshkreli &amp; subreddit r/martinshkreli. Those are authentic and discuss why GME is one of the most unprecedented events in market history. Here, I'm going to discuss the populist attitude that is creeping into this odd situation and add some thoughts on short-selling in general.\r\n  \nLet's cover my own unique angle on the concept of a 'short squeeze'. Most would define it as an erratic upward change in price driven by short-covering. I believe short-squeezes defined this way are usually a fictitious idee fixe that aggregates a number of discrete market behaviors and dynamics into a convenient and pithy moniker. The image of python-like buyer constricting some hapless speculator into a higher stock price is evocative but misleading. Many knew me as a short-selling specialist on Wall Street, focused on 'binary events' of biotech stocks. I think I've seen it all: I was once short more than 75% of a company's shares outstanding (I do not recommend this). I bought 75% of a company on the open market, etc.\r\n  \nShort-sellers are governed by the same market dynamics as longs. They get nervous when positions go against them and consider exiting. Like longs, they can double down if they wish. The only difference is that, of course, short positions grow when stocks rise. And they can rise infinitely, while long positions fall asymptotically to zero. But both get, theoretically and assuming no fundamental changes have occurred, more attractive as they move against the trader.\r\n  \nShort sellers have to pay borrow fees to longs (typically tiny, but sometimes massive). They have to locate stock to short, again usually easy, but sometimes difficult. Both are perilous when those rare adverse times arise. Why? Despite the possibility of a growing cost of renting stock, the ultimate fear of a short-seller is a \"buy-in\". It is nightmarish and has only happened to me once or twice, excluding options-related activity. A buy-in occurs when a broker decides to forcibly exit the short position on behalf of the trader because the broker and trader cannot secure the 'locate' which is supposed to underlie the short sale. The buy-in order is typically violently disruptive: a market order for the whole position near the closing hours of the market! The SEC published a list of stocks at risk of buy-in: the fail to deliver list.\r\n  \nMy point is that a 'short squeeze' can only practically affect the trader for two reasons. The first is that the trader digs in, doubles down and doesn't exit as his position grows. That's bad trading, and will eventually blow the trader up. But, if the stock is a 'good short', that short will be replaced by more traders with stronger hands/a better entry price/smaller position. What's more is the average investor can't tell if this is happening! The second is the buy-in. I haven't heard GME shorts being bought in, but again, how would you know, other than the grapevine? My point is most of the disruptive, exciting trading here is simply long speculators banging away at the stock.\r\n  \nNew longs are sometimes attracted to rising prices, speculating they'll increase further: that's called momentum. Those buyers are typically offset by the existing longs who are excited to exit at higher prices. But, if there is a large short position in the stock, a speculator may feel that those covering (buying to get out) short-sellers will provide additional fuel to the momentum. That's sometimes the case, but higher prices should lead to more supply from both long and short sellers. My feeling is the actions of large long holders probably have more influence on the stock price than shorts who dart in and out, and typically in smaller size. Remember that shorts who capitulate are often just replaced by new shorts who are attracted at the new lunar prices.\r\n  \nIn essence, 'short squeezes' become a self-fulfilling prophecy as new long investors pile in trying to 'squeeze' this sometimes phantom of a short seller, and existing long investors may hold off selling for the same reason. With some Popperian skepticism you will easily see that the same dynamic can exist without the short boogeyman, or with a short boogeyman of any size. Speaking of which, where is Chanos and his slavish groupie, Carson Block? \r\n  \nSpeculative momentum can occur for any reason. Let's not forget that the 'trapping shorty' strategy is an awkward idea for a few reasons. Short sellers are often sophisticated market participants who are betting on the decline of a stock. You usually don't want these type of traders sniffing around your favorite longs: I recall writing a 'short report' on a stock to watch it fall 50% that day. If you do a study of stock returns of highly shorted stocks, they are pretty awful. The reason there is 'no arbitrage' is the borrow rate. \r\n  \nBut even if you got this poor short to capitulate and squeeze, the amount of buyers who are now holding stock at absurdly high prices put way more energy (and money) into the stock than the short seller's white towel ever could. A sledgehammer killed the fly: now what? Alternatively, are you the host or the parasite?\r\n  \nOn populism. I don't really think most investors or speculators should go into any investment thinking that there is 'an enemy'. Concentrated (big) investments (bets) give rise to emotional behavior, typically the enemy in trading and investing as it clouds rational thinking. It's a lot better to be Socratic with your 'opponent' and understand what they're thinking. If your position were to be half the size it currently is, would you be as emotionally interested? Try it! You'll lower your risk and feel better.\r\n  \nSome of the behavior going on at WSB sounds more jihadist than speculative. The idea that there are some investors who are 'good' and others who are 'bad', or that there is an 'establishment' is BS. Everyone has the same goal: I have a pile of money, I'm trying to make it bigger, fuck your pile--I don't care about it. Anything other goal is contrived, foolish and won't help you win. You can't 'fight the rich' by trying to become one of them. Don't you see the irony? A related thought experiment: what if this trade continued to work really well? And another, and another? Then some WSBers are billionaires. Aren't they the new 'enemy/establishment?'\r\n  \nWho do you think hedge fund managers are? They're typically the anti-establishment. Things have changed a bit, but the most successful HFMs are actually the WSBers of the past. These are guys who didn't fit in well at i-banks, often got kicked out for having big mouths or not wearing the right ties, or just wanting to wear jeans at work and not fill out TPS reports. When they started their firms, people like Soros, Icahn, Steinhardt, Robertson, Cohen, Griffin, Loeb (who has posted anonymously on boards), Samberg, even Cramer were fish out of water and had very tiny amounts of capital, often begging for investors.\r\n  \nThe need for an enemy. To sustain increasingly insane behavior, it isn't uncommon to use a straw man or a scapegoat. Oppressive regimes used this technique in the past, and the media uses it today. Retail investors don't have much power individually. With your $5k RH account, you can't day trade or even qualify for margin. It's pitiful. So, it's understandably quite exciting to finally feel like a 'player' that you read about. To be a part of 'something'. The problem is the media is goading you to be somewhere between a lemming and a life-agnostic but impotent jihadist. Blowing yourself up won't impress anyone, and there is no afterlife here, other than a minimum wage career and mom's sofa. GME and shorting in general is small potatos in the scheme of the Wall St. machine. Don't worry about getting 'even' with the rich. That's jousting at a windmill that will waste your energy.\r\n  \nNo one here, hopefully, wants to be a lemming. Those willing to 'die on this hill' have to realize something: Wall Street doesn't care about its speculators. The new traders who vanquish the old simply replace them. Nothing changes. When LTCM blew up, or Amaranth, Visium, Galleon, or anyone else, it is 'out with the old and in with the new'. So, perhaps WSB can blow up 1 hedge fund or maybe 5, but so what? Eventually, the tables will turn and it will blow up. The leveraged, fast-money trading markets are a violent place and the only people who care one whit are the brokers charging fees (directly or indirectly). They only care to make sure the sorry carcasses can pay their bills. They know there will always be another speculator lined up, ready to shove his money into the lotto machine. There is no pride here. There is no credit for being a good solider. You either survive or you don't. Your job is to survive and thrive. Becoming a lemming will guarantee failure as per the statistical truism of gambler's ruin (enjoy the proof in measure theory). With enough time, anyone playing a game with &lt;50% success rate (equal payouts), will lose all their money. Get that number above 50%. Add the Kelly Criterion to your trading strategy.\r\n  \nYou might ask, \"(that's all well and good OR we'll agree to disagree) but, Mr. Shrek, isn't this a good trading strategy? (ganging up on shorted stocks)?\" As long as you're not a lemming/jihadist (willing to walk over the cliff, whether or not you have a \"cause\"), and you ignore a somewhat slimy ethical/market manipulation question, I don't see anything wrong with it. There are better ways to make money, since you're asking. Stoking (or worse, participating in) a buying frenzy that is akin to a forced musical chairs game is a little crazy. Once a stock is absurdly valued, you're just hoping the sell-off doesn't happen while you're holding it. If you have enough lemmings or jihadists 'helping you', that's a good thing. They will hold your bag--someone needs to. \r\n  \nOf course, if you've found the \"next\" Microsoft or Apple, no one needs to hold any bags. But, no company can increase its objective (aka fair) value quickly enough for this... phenomenon? situation? absurdity?... to make it reasonable. Those things take years, go slow and steady, and this frenzied buying/\"short squeeze\" phenomenon won't let value play a factor. That's why WSB GME longs have shifted theses from \"well, Gamestop was/is cheap\" to \"the gaming cycle\" to \"Ryan Cohen will save us\" to \"...jihad?!\"\r\n  \nEach member of the herd has its own financial parameters, too. Some may have $500, some $50,000,000 or more. Some may be willing to lose their entire stake (and even more) on an out-of-the-money or levered trade. Some are not. Some were in the latter and somehow end up in the former. Some are in one column at one price and another column at another--some are switched from column to column by force. Today's lemmings/jihadists are tomorrow's sellers. When you're hanging off the mountain, pay attention to the guy holding the rope.\r\n  \nLoosely 'coordinated' buying can certainly affect stocks. Heavily shorted stocks and small cap stocks are the kind that require less capital than typical to 'move' a stock. The irony here is when putting on a position, the trader's goal is typically NOT to move the stock with his actions!\r\n  \nI still think GME is wildly overvalued, but that doesn't exactly mean I'm 'bearish'. One funny idea here is reflexivity: GME stockholders may become serious GME customers and the company's fundamentals improve that way! Excluding some such miracle, eventually GME stock will trade at &lt;50 again. I still think it will trade at 1,000 or more BEFORE that happens, and that the decline process will take a long, long time (several years). Keep in mind, anything can change. GME can do serial secondaries that destroy its stock. Management's job is to create value for their shareholders--but perhaps they will avoid pissing them off. There's a strange loop! Finally, the stock could be halted by the SEC or completely banned by brokers. Don't overdo it. Watch the borrow rate. Keep your positions at less than 25% of your capital--live to play another day. \r\n  \nDisclosure: I've never traded GME stock and do not intend to.\n\n(From martin, posted by mo)",

        "selftext": "Good afternoon\n\nThe current market has some obvious similarities with the internet bubble in the 2000s at the moment:\n\n1) Sectoral bubble\n\nElectric Vehicle stocks, Renewable energy stocks, crypto and possibly even fintech stocks have skyrocketed to insane levels in 2020. A PE ratio of 100-200 for stocks in these sectors is considered \"cheap\" right now, that's what \"investors\" before the dotcom crash thought aswell.\n\n2) Historic low interest rates\n\nThis is the biggest catalyst for the creation of an insane bubble, very low interest rates. Just like in the 2000s, we currently have historic low interest rates, which makes stocks the only game in town. The big myth here is that people think stocks only go up, with interest rates close to 0. That's absolutely not true and that's the scary part in my opinion, because even professionals and analysts think that. The market doesn't stay disconnected from the economy forever.\n\n3) IPO mania and speculation\n\nWe haven't seen more IPO's in 2020 since the dotcom bubble. This on itself isn't a big deal, but the valuations these IPO's get are beyond insanity. Any company that gets linked to EV in some way, automatically gets a 100%+ boost to their stock price, without even having a product or sales number. 1999 all over again?\n\n4) \"New paradigm\"\n\nLet's be honest, at least 80% of the people in any financial subreddit (excluding WSB, +-99% there) thinks that Tesla is the new paradigm that will take over the world. Trust me, it is not. I've been doing some math on Tesla valuation, and I have no fitting word for its current valuation. I won't go in the details why, because I could write a whole book about this. I still firmly believe that growing positive cashflows should be the main catalyst of a stock that goes up, and a company with a negative cashflow (THAT ONLY GROWS AT A 25% RATE) shouldn't get a 1t valuation, that's too disrespectful for companies such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple. \n\n6) Greed and FOMO\n\nEveryone wants to jump on this train, no one wants to miss out, but I can assure you, these valuations are absurd and those who can't get out early enough, will be left holding the (empty) bag.\n\nKind regards and stay safe (physically and financially)",

        "selftext": "Tesla stock went up almost 700% this year because Wedbush (who\u2019s made an absolute fortune getting people to buy into his narrative) got retail investors to buy into the narrative that Tesla is not an automotive company, despite over 90% of its revenue coming from selling cars. Once the narrative stuck that it\u2019s a \u201ctech\u201d company, BAM, valuation goes up $550B. And please don\u2019t be an autist and say something retarded like \u201cif Tesla is a car company then Apple is a phone company\u201d. Yes, over 50% of apples revenue is from phones, but they also have huge revenue segments in Mac, IPad, Audio, Services, etc. So, if Apples revenue was 90% phones then yes that statement would be true, buts it\u2019s not so please don\u2019t try and justify it with that stupid brainwashing comment (which I know someone will post in the comments and get 1k upvotes). \n\nNow, Tesla is a phenomenal company with a visionary leader, don\u2019t get me wrong - but they are being priced like the next Amazon. One slip up and they will tumble - or if they can\u2019t find that one thing that will essentially print money for them (Apple iPhone, Google ads, Microsoft Azure, Amazon web services), then valuation will get cut in half. The first 6x months will be about value stocks, and I predict Tesla hits $500 before it hits $900. I think this year makes millionaires first from Tesla puts, then calls in the second half of the year. \n\nThe only thing I can think of that makes this not happen is the amount of cash they have on hand from selling more shares. That amount of money is dangerous in the hands of Elon. But let\u2019s see what happens - I think puts are the way to go early on, could net some new millionaires.",

        "selftext": "I'll admit it. All this Blackberry pump got me hyped and I want to get some action too. BB has potential to moon, but I think a lot of you will still manage to lose money, because you are picking wrong strategies.\n\n**The problem**\n\nI know this sub is obsessed with short term OTM calls. However by buying these you are doing no justice to yourself and this community.\n\nLet me explain. Have you ever wondered who sells you these calls? I'll tell you. Big guys and by big guys I'm talking billion dollar financial institutions that we call **market makers**. Market maker does not care which stock, what strike, how many \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 we put here - all they care about is to **make money by selling you calls.**\n\nMarket makers are very good at managing risk. Whenever they sell calls, they make sure they have the underlying stock. That way, they essentially sell **covered calls** instead of **naked calls**.\n\nWhen you look at the option table, you will notice a column called **Open Interest**. It basically tells you have many option contracts are out there in the wild. Think about this as a number of retards holding these in their Robinhood account, hoping to get rich quickly.\n\nMarket makers love when there is a big hype around certain stock, especially certain strike and date. They sell these calls to you retards, and all they have to do as the expiration date nears is make sure **the stock stays below the most popular strike**, aka **strike with the most open interest**.\n\nWhy would they do that? Because they **make free money** by selling you these worthless gambling short term tickets.\n\nHow would they do this? By shorting the stock. Remember they are so big that they can afford to short the stock and suppress the price of the stock **in the short term** just in time for **your short term calls to expire worthless**.\n\nI know some of you geniuses will tell me that market makers can't manipulate the stock in the short term; sure keep telling yourself that while you ride in your 2010 Toyota Corolla.\n\n**You are easy targets**\n\nOver 11,000 of you idiots, bought $12 February calls. Don't believe me? Check it yourself: [https://twitter.com/silberschmelzer/status/1350903153433128967/photo/1](https://twitter.com/silberschmelzer/status/1350903153433128967/photo/1)\n\nAll market makers have to do now, is make sure BB does not moon past $12 by February 19 and they are set. You lost your stimulus check money and have no means to play again.\n\nMarch is even worse: [https://twitter.com/silberschmelzer/status/1350910637451468801/photo/1](https://twitter.com/silberschmelzer/status/1350910637451468801/photo/1). All of you piling into $15 strikes. Why are you making yourself easy targets? You are disclosing your strike and your date! What if BB moons in April? Can you sustain wasting money on these monthly calls with your minimum wage jobs?\n\n**The solution**\n\nBuy shares. They do not expire. There is no pressure to be right. You want to be on the \ud83d\ude80 when it starts taking off, instead of being broke on the ground.\n\nWith worthless calls, no one will like you - even this sub will make funny of you.\n\nBelieve me. I've been here long enough to remember MSFT 03/21/2020 C $200 and PLTR 12/31/2020 C $30.\n\n**TL;DR**  \nBuy BB shares, not short term OTM calls.",

I was there not too long ago... you see... \n\nBack in November I noticed $BB cleanly up-trending on the hourly bouncing off the 9 and 26 MA (I use ichimoku) heading towards a resistance level that had already formed a double top \n\nLike a true Gamblers fallacy believing retard I made a wager: \n\n$10k into $6 calls expiring March on the DD that: \u201cwhat are the chances it falls AGAIN there\u201d ... that\u2019s it. \n\nA few days later AWS news came, and that $10k turned into $70k. Pure luck. Sometimes she goes, sometimes she doesn\u2019t. She went that day.\n\nIn that moment of seeing massive profits on AWS news day, I experienced violent and absolutely tremendous autism and thought, this thing is going from $5\u2019s to $15 in a single trading session, yes, even more retarded than you guys that bought the top on Friday \n\nSensible thoughts couldn\u2019t penetrate my helmet fast enough as drool gushed from my gaping mouth, gasping for oxygen and yelling at the top of my lungs what barely resembled words about Lambo\u2019s and Yachts... so I hurled about $100k into shares at $8.77 and about $10k more into $15 leaps \n\nI proceeded to watch my profit dwindle to nothing as earnings came and bent me over so hard I couldn\u2019t bring myself to watch the stock for a week \n\nI thought about selling the bottom, I was there, order ready typed, just needed to hit the send button, and I was going to close my position around $6.7ish and be back to break even after striking gold \n\nBut you know what, I remembered it\u2019s just money. I remembered that everything in reality is in flux, and changing, and decaying, and being born again, and to just flow with it and stop clinging and desiring one set of experiences over another (aka a fat bank account over giving $5 blowies behind a Wendy\u2019s) who cares? \n\nAll is well lads. So let go of the burden if you bought the top and are stressing, it\u2019s really fine. Look at what\u2019s happening right now:\n\n1) Insane volume, insane moves, erratic behavior (something is going on behind the curtain) \n\nPS: this movement and volume is NOT because of WSB, full stop. Big players are making huge moves here, and fast, we don\u2019t know why yet \n\n2) 1 Billion annual revenue \n3) Soon to come online a RECURRING AUTO DATA business that will drive revenue into growth cycle, BB is literally Microsoft Windows for cars but the auto sector was still underdeveloped technologically to benefit from this position, hence this vertical is finally about to print HUGE HUGE HUGE MEGA BILLIONS ANNUAL. This was always the plan and they just had to wait it out until the auto sector caught up with them digitally \n\n(The auto data tech sector is so lucrative it made Papa Elon the richest person in the world, and forced a fucking god damn phone company to join the race \ud83c\udf4e\u2014it\u2019s huge)\n\n4) UNDER, FUCKING, VALUED \n5) VERTICALS GALORE\n5) FB settled, imagine the BALLS on BB going after this massive and dirty tech behemoth run by a literal lizard, they are honest Canadians doing God\u2019s work \n6) IOT, AI, smart city\u2019s, insert other buzzwords \n\nI could go on and on, and honestly, I\u2019ve never felt more comfortable holding ANY stock than this \n\nMoral of the story: as I let go and accepted my circumstances and decided to diamond hand \ud83d\udc8e \ud83e\udd1a BB to the death, within a few days I proceeded to watch the fattest, thickest, randomest, greenest dildo penetrate my butt hole to the high heavens and take me from what was $70k profit to 0 profit back up to $130k profit. I\u2019ve trimmed half the options, I don\u2019t even know why tbh, reverse autism maybe, but I\u2019m riding my remaining calls and entire share position to Valhalla. \n\nWill likely add more if it dips. But...\n\nJust hold. Something is cooking on BB. You have to be a retard not to see it. Look at the fucking daily chart, look at the volume, the gaps, the swings, BB chart literally has Tourette\u2019s syndrome right now... \n\nThis stock has not moved like this for 10 years. \n\nIt might stall a little, deflate from here, consolidate a bit more, or it might blast off again any second. Point is, nobody knows when, but it looks like in a short time, we will know why this stock is moving the way it has. Something is DEFINITELY going on behind the scenes the public is not aware of and neither is the media \n\nFor fucks sake I found the court docs showing global settlement with FB is done 24 hours before gay ass Bloomberg even picked it up. The majority of the investor world still thinks they make fucking phones for Gods sake. Everyone is sleeping on this \n\nA note on Jim just in case he reads this:\n\nJim Cramer hates this stock because 1) BB and John Chen are not bootlicking CEO\u2019s jerking off CNBC and massaging Cramers asshole for air time, they\u2019re a tightly run, honorable company doing real things 2) He most likely became a bag holder during the epic fall of the BB phone and sold for a fat loss and wants to protect his ego by continuing to ignore the facts on the company\n\nThe guy wants you to invest in CRWD with a fucking ridiculous market cap, no verticals, and less revenue than BB. Promoting a literal bubble over a value play. What a bizarre world we live in. Take advantage of it, I hear this phrase all the time and I fucking hate it, but this is literally \u201cfree money\u201d \n\nKnow what you own. There is TRUE value in this company. No hype. Pure value. \n\nDiamond hand, double down, buy more, and just hold. You are in good hands \ud83d\ude4c\n\nTl;dr diamond hand $BB",

        "selftext": "I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page, regardless of the subreddit, then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.\n\n**How is \"Hype\" calculated?**\n\nWell, this is a little tricky but it's based on the engagement that the post received in that sub-reddit relative to other posts in the same sub-reddit\n\n**How can I use this list?**\n\nThe best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits.

And a look at recent news.\n\nAs a long on Nokia, I have been lurking this sub and I see a lot of the same misconceptions about Nokia and well, I believe its time for me to bring some clarity to the reality that is $NOK\n\n**Myth #1 Nokia is a phone company.**\n\nThis is wrong, Nokia is not a phone company. They sold their phone business to Microsoft back in 2013 for over 7 billion dollars, later it was sold by Microsoft to HMD for 350 million dollars in 2016, who currently makes the phones. Nokia just gets royalties for the use of their name.\n\n[https://www.geekwire.com/2019/microsoft-nokia-reunite-new-alliance-5-years-failed-7b-smartphone-megadeal/](https://www.geekwire.com/2019/microsoft-nokia-reunite-new-alliance-5-years-failed-7b-smartphone-megadeal/)\n\n**Myth #2 Nokia has been under the same failed management for 25 years.**\n\nCorrection, Nokia hired on a new CEO Pekka Lundmark in August of 2020 and took full leadership in September. He previously worked for Nokia between 1990 and 2000, when he helped oversee the company\u2019s emergence as the world\u2019s biggest mobile phone manufacturer and a significant player in mobile infrastructure. \n\nCareer history:\n\nPresident and CEO, Fortum, 2015\u20132020\n\nPresident and CEO, Konecranes, 2005\u20132015\n\nGroup Executive Vice President, Konecranes, 2004\u20132005\n\nPresident and CEO, Hackman, 2002\u20132004\n\nManaging Partner, Startupfactory, 2000\u20132002\n\nSenior Vice President, Marketing, Nokia Internet Communications, 1998\u20132000\n\nVice President, Strategy &amp; Business Development, Nokia Telecommunications, 1996\u20131998\n\nVice President, Access Systems Business Unit, Nokia Telecommunications, 1994\u20131996\n\nManaging Director, Nokia Telecommunications Denmark, 1992\u20131994\n\nAccount Manager, Nokia Cellular Systems, 1990\u20131992\n\n[https://www.nokia.com/about-us/company/leadership-and-governance/group-leadership-team/pekka-lundmark/](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/company/leadership-and-governance/group-leadership-team/pekka-lundmark/)\n\n# Nokia global head to go as executive exodus continues\n\nhttps://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/home-banner/nokia-global-head-to-go-as-executive-exodus-continues\n\n**Myth #3 Nokia is not involved with Autonomous vehicles and cant be compared to Blackberry**\n\nNokia and SoftBank claim 5G first for connected cars\n\nFinnish comms giant and Japanese operator reveal trials that they say successfully demonstrate that 5G technology can be safely and efficiently utilised for connected cars\n\n[https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252478438/Nokia-and-SoftBank-claim-5G-first-for-connected-cars](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252478438/Nokia-and-SoftBank-claim-5G-first-for-connected-cars)\n\n5G ecosystem paves the way to automated vehicles\n\n[https://www.nokia.com/blog/5g-ecosystem-paves-way-automated-vehicles/](https://www.nokia.com/blog/5g-ecosystem-paves-way-automated-vehicles/)\n\nNokia Future X for industries solutions can help you digitally transform your vehicle manufacturing operation and bring new levels of safety, engagement and \u201cconnectedness\u201d to your customers, partners, suppliers and to your own workforce.\n\n[https://www.nokia.com/networks/industries/automotive/](https://www.nokia.com/networks/industries/automotive/)\n\n**Myth #4 Nokia is losing market share due to competition**\n\nWhile yes, there is strong competition in the 5G market, Huawei the global leader, is facing bans across the United States and Europe, ZTE who makes up a small fraction of the market share is also seeing geopolitical pressure. Current estimates of market share show the following Huawei 28.5% Ericsson 26.5% Nokia 22% Samsung 8.5% ZTE 5% and others 9.5%.\n\nHere is an updated list on each countries stance on Huawei and ZTE.

For those preferring a more concentrated portfolio style, I think this is an interesting question - because these are all great companies, but naturally one must be better than the others.\n\nIf you had to pick just one of the mega-caps, which do you buy today?\n\nMy personal thoughts:\n\n- Facebook. I see potential competition to their network, but the balance sheet is a fortress and valuation has been pushed down a bit due to general public hatred. A contrarian pick. (B)\n\n- Apple. In my opinion the valuation of this has run away farther ahead of its earnings relative to the others, making it the least attractive of the bunch for me. (C-)\n\n- Amazon. Doing amazing things, looking at the last several quarters their earnings seem to be accelerating - however the p/e is higher than all the rest. (A-)\n\n- Microsoft. The sleeper choice, solid valuation in addition to growth. Not flashy but a money printer. (A)\n\n- Google. My perception is that they're slipping - taking lots of high risk/high payoff bets that don't appear to be paying off yet. Feels potentially contrarian but I'm not wildly excited.

Now that that disclaimer is done\n\nMan blackberry, who the hell thought I\u2019d be investing in you after the fall of BBM and Brickbreaker. Well, strap in folks as I take you through one of the most bullish stories in stonk history, and it all starts with one statement. Everything you\u2019re thinking about with Blackberry at the moment, is wrong.\n\nIt is not a phone company. It is not telling you to use BBM. It is a software, automotive, and cybersecurity company that is about to make a killing. Let\u2019s begin:\n\nBB stock price, 6.71 as of Close on 1-6-2021. \n\nTechnically, this thing is a fucking beauty. MACD flip, Stoch RSI cross, volume died on the sells and the thing is pushing up just the market died twice while it had solid momentum. This is going to move soon, but let's go away from crayons and into the magical land of make believe, news events, conferences, and fundamentals. It's not just two letters, it's a business. https://www.tradingview.com/x/uI3Cl51F/ \n\n**Recent Earnings**\n\nFiscal Quarter End| Date Reported| Earnings Per Share* | Consensus EPS* Forecast| % Surprise\n---|---|----|----|----\nNov 2020| 12/17/2020| 0.1 | -0.04| 100\nAug 2020| 09/24/2020| 0.1| -0.02| 600\nMay 2020| 06/24/2020| 0| -0.04| 100\nFeb 2020| 03/31/2020| 0.06| 0.01| 500\n\n\n\nSurprises along the board.\n\n* Revenues last quarter, $224 MM.\n* Revenues projected for Q4, $246 MM.\n* Full year Guidance 2021, $950 MM. \n* Mkt cap, $4 B. \nTotal company non-GAAP revenue of $224 million; total company GAAP revenue of $218 million. Non-GAAP earnings per basic and diluted share of $0.02; GAAP loss per basic and diluted share of $0.23. Net cash generated from operating activities of $29 million.\n\n\n\nSaw this cute image of CRWD PLTR and SNOW, all with similar or lower Revs but SNOW is half but worth 20x BB, CRWD has less revs but is operating at 11.75x, PLTR (WSB fav) has 50M more projected annual revs and is worth 11x. Alright who cares about revenue, that's only today. If only it accounted for the big event happening in the next 9 days (see news events below).\n\n**NEWS EVENTS**\n\n*FB settlement*\n\nI\u2019m not going to go into deep detail here as it is quite intricate and all I know is that BB won a suit against fuckerberg $FB related to messaging, whatsapp, and something else. $FB has till January 15th, 2020 to settle, see here: https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.331602/gov.uscourts.cand.331602.144.0.pdf \n\nThis FB settlement is not included in earnings expectations, meaning THAT SHIT GOES UP or will be in analyst projections.\n\n*BlackBerry IVY - Intellectual Vehicle Data Platform*\n\nThe big kahuna that will change BB for the next few years. Per BB website: \u201cBlackBerry and AWS are joining forces to develop BlackBerry IVY, a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences and improve operations of connected vehicles with new BlackBerry QNX and AWS technology.\u201d\n\nWhat does it mean to the end consumer (the automakers?)\n\n**IVY Fueling Business Outcomes**\n\nBlackBerry IVY will help automakers and automotive suppliers:\n\nFuel Innovation by supporting rapid development of new customer experiences\nDrive Revenue by unlocking new revenue streams and business models\nReduce Costs by moving processing to the edge &amp; reducing raw data transmission\nImprove Operations with enhanced data visibility and access\nExpand Ecosystems by unlocking the broader app developer community\n\n\nWanna watch a video?

Want more info? https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/aws Read this and watch their conferences coming up.\n\n**Partnerships with big companies**\n\nBlackberry partnered with Zoom (link: https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/10/blackberry-and-zoom-together-secure-your-virtual-enterprise-meetings), Microsoft Teams (link: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-athoc-integrates-with-microsoft-teams-for-critical-event-management-301147559.html) and some other company that I forgot. Cybersecurity adding onto big big platforms that exploded this past year. MORE MONEY you dumbasses.\n\nPatents\nBB started offloading old patents but have one that will be important as of recent, with the sexiest one being this: https://uspto.report/patent/grant/10880812 \n\nVery pretty stuff, big sex.\n\n\n**Business Implications**\n\nBB makes their money from licensing, cybersecurity (one of the only companies that have not been hacked in this SolarWind shit), BB QNX is already in 175 MM cars worldwide, partnered with XPEV, and is in talks with multiple Tier 1 automakers, 20 different OEMs, and will be in vehicles by 2023. Does that mean anything now? Yes, you dumbass. Per CEO John Chen, my new president, #DidYouKnow @BlackBerry has been selected by 19 of the top 25 #ElectricVehicle manufacturers, and they represent 61% of the Electric Vehicle market?\n\nBubblicious and sexy. Expect some of the big tier 1s like Nissan, Toyota, BMW, and others to jump on this train. Think TSLA doesn\u2019t have competition? Bitch they cant even make a billion dollars unless they sell stock (which since MS just upgraded their price, I bet they offer at least $5B in stock in the coming days).\n\n**CONFERENCES**  \n\nBB is speaking at the following conferences:\n\nCiti\u2019s 2021 Global TMT West Virtual Conference - Thursday January 7th, 2021 at 1 PM with the Steve Rai, Blackberry CFO  and John Wall, Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions (BTS) \n\nJP Morgan 19th Annual Tech / Auto Forum\nTuesday January 12th, 2021 at 5:45 PM ET \nwith the Steve Rai, Blackberry CFO  and John Wall, Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions (BTS) \n\nNeedham\u2019s 23rd Annual Virtual Growth Conference \nFriday, January 15th, 2021 at 1:15 pm ET \nWith Ryan Permeh, Blackberry Chief Security Architect &amp; Co-founder of Cylance and Eric Cornelius, Blackberry Chief Product Architect \n\nThis was just announced and you bet your ass this will pump this stock up.\n\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis stock will generate a lot more cash in the coming years, will gain in the short term by offloading old patents, settling with FB and getting some moolah, growing in their partnership with Bezos gang, roll out to more EVs with Tier 1 and Tier 2 automotive companies, and compete with Tesla on this as well. This shit trades at $6.70 and is so close to going up if the market just doesn\u2019t crash in the interim. They already are used by big companies for Access and other Mobile applications, so that someone can securely use their dinky iPhone to work. Think big whales aren\u2019t interested? Look at 2022 2023 option OI. \n\nI think this goes to lower PT of $10 by May, more likely $15. uThInKitWiLLdOUbleINmKTcAp???? Yes you fucking idiot, this is trading at 4X sales only, will be profitable this year, and has so much shit coming up. This is UNDER 4B!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just buy the stock and sit on it. Want options? Buy them too. Have fun guys, I hope you all make money.\n\nMy positions:\n\n29 contracts Feb $7C, bought as recently as yesterday.\n1300 Shares, price avg of $7.001. I could have actively traded this prior to ER but decided to long term hold cause I am not a daytrader, and I fully believe in this hypothesis. I wouldn\u2019t be typing this shit if not.

        "selftext": "Every other post is \"ShOrT SqUeEzE\" on AMC NOK BB etc. I even saw a post on a short squeeze on Silver and Gold.   \n\n\nThis is getting ridiculous. You all are posting or trying to rush to the next company to try to get in cheap because you believed you missed out on the GME short squeeze, WHEN THE GME SQUEEZE HASN'T EVEN OCCURRED YET. All your posts about AMC and NOK are lazy and the only theory you have as to why the price for these companies are going up is because you can squeeze the shorts on these companies and beat the hedge funds. Lots of people have already lost money on these stocks on Thursday.\n\nFLASHBACK to several months before GME exploded and this sub gained millions of new followers, there was a fundamental bull thesis for GME as a company and their future prospects. That's why many of us, including myself, got in early when the price was between $10-$20. GME was not going bankrupt despite the narrative behind it. They had cash on hand to pay down debt. They are going to crush their Q4 earnings because of console sales and historically have done very well during game console releases. They have revenue sharing agreements with Microsoft. They are opening gaming centers. Their 1000+ retail locations can be transformed to distribution centers. Their ecommerce is rapidly growing every year. Ryan Cohen and the new board members are yelling at the boomers running GME and telling them what they need to do in this new era of gaming and digital. \n\nThe short interest + squeeze on GME is CHERRY ON TOP. And the timing of catalysts because of console release, Q4 earnings, and digital sales because of the pandemic puts GME owners in a unique spot to capitalize on the shitty positions shorters find themselves now to be squeezed. \n\nTLDR: Before you blindly throw your money at AMC and NOK because of \"short squeeze\" think about whether or not there are going to be any catalysts and bull cases as to why the stock price should be going up to potentially trigger a squeeze.   \n\n\nPosition: In at $GME since December with cost avg. of $17.56",

        "selftext": "I think that we can finally say that there is a pretty clear bubble, more or less in different  areas. The market has been acting absolutely wild as everyone can clearly see. People are pumping stocks for fun and that is worrying me a lot. If things go south, how big of a reaction will there be in the entire stock market?\n\nGamestop, Blackberry, AMC, Nokia have been pumped really heavily and seeing 100% gains in a single day for no reason should warn us to be alert at all times. Especially now, when many of us haven\u2019t experienced this ever before in this big of a scale. \n\nWhile I\u2019m really liking how the retail investors are kicking the hedge fund managers\u2019 asses, we all should be prepared for the worst. Once people start to realize their gains and start to sell, we\u2019re in for a wild show. And that moment will come sooner or later. That\u2019s just a fact. People will want money at some point. When that point comes, you should have probably sold and gotten out already.\n\nI don\u2019t like to be bearish, but I\u2019d say that there\u2019s a some kind of a bubble now and it will affect all areas more or less.\n\nFundamentals are literally trash for people. Microsoft and Apple released some staggering all time high results yesterday and only few people seemed to give a damn about it, at least in this sub. I wonder when we\u2019re gonna go to a different direction and pivot towards a more fundamental orientated market. It could take a long time, or it could happen next month.\n\nBecause in the end, the companies with solid fundamentals and consistant long term growth will be the ones that will perform in the long term... \n\n...But this is a different topic which needs to be discussed on a later date.\n\n\n\nThe saddest part of this is that the ones who suffer from this, will be us, retail investors. People will think that Gamestop, AMC &amp; Co will only go up. That is unfortunately, not the case. \n\nAnd I\u2019m fearing that some of us will realize that too late. Some people have bought stocks with debt and this will bite heavily in the ass, when these meme stocks go down hill. And trust me, they go down quicker than up.\n\nPeople\u2019s mental health will be on the line, when they see their brokerage accounts heavily in the cold. This is my biggest worry. How will people react to this when things go south and GME drops from their current levels.\n\nSo all I\u2019m asking is for people to be wise with their money and put in an amount that they\u2019re comfortable losing with. Stocks do go down. GME goes down. And everyone should be ready for it at all times.\n\nThanks in advance.",

        "selftext": "Okay listen up autists. I have seen a lot doom and gloom about GME lately, speculation about poor holiday sales, complaints about the short squeeze not happening, shortages in supply for the new consoles and even some \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b treading out in the open. So let me clarify to you retards some ignored reasons why GME is going to the moon \ud83c\udf1a \n\nLet's start out with a common misconception which I have seen debunked a few times but still seems to linger. It seems that a lot of you retards just look at the chart of the stock price and think that Gamestops all time high was in the low 60-ies or high 50-ies. WRONG. Ok technically, this is true, but it is not important. The all time high for Gamestop stock was 63 dollars per share back in 2007. The problem is that Gamestop had a lot more shares back then. The all time high for the market cap of Gamestop is $9.86 billion. *The current market cap is $1.15 billion.* That means that if Gamestop grew just to the same size it was before with RCs new vision for the company, the stock would increase **8.6 times to $150(\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80).** \n\nNot only is the all time high probably a lot higher than some of you thought, the market for gaming has grown significantly since then and it is still growing. The gaming market has increased 2.5 times in size since 2007 and keeps growing each year. Gamestop is also shifting its business from just selling games to selling very high margin items like collectibles, PC parts and gaming equipment and signing deals for online sales with Microsoft. Additionally, e-commerce companies, especially ones in large and growing industries, are generally valued a lot higher than brick and mortar shops. That means that reaching the same size as old Gamestop did might entail a greater stock price.\n\nOk so we have established that there is a lot of potential for GME stock and for some of you autists that's enough to throw your life savings into it. But I can already see my future DMs filled with [\ud83c\udf08](https://emojipedia.org/rainbow/)\ud83d\udc3b saying that the potential doesn't matter because gAmEsToP iS tHe NeW bLoCkBuStEr and they are going to either go bankrupt or get smaller and smaller over time until they aren't relevant anymore. So lets make clear what the vision for Gamestop's future is. By which I mean what certified genius Ryan Cohen wants for its future. Cohen's vision can be summarized as a transition from a brick and mortar shop to an e-commerce giant competing with Amazon. He is famously obsessed with customer service and wants to make Gamestop the 1 stop for all things gaming. Imagine a slick website where you can buy everything related to gaming: gaming PC parts, gaming collectibles, etc. Add in 24/7 customer service provided by people knowledgeable about the products Gamestop will be selling. As well as fast shipping with a whopping $0 delivery fee because there are thousands of Gamestops all over the US where you can pick up your order. All these things were hallmarks Cohens previous company and in articles like [this one](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanverdon/2020/01/26/ryan-cohen-started-a-company-that-took-on-amazon-and-sold-it-for-3-billion-now-hes-thinking-about-whats-next/?sh=655bf7165579) where he talks excessively about the importance of providing those features in an e-commerce environment. \n\nTo finish off I would like to show you just how dedicated Cohen seems to be to making Gamestop an e-commerce giant. The article I linked above is from January 2020, about 6 months before Cohen made his first investment into Gamestop and is titled \u201cRyan Cohen Started A Company That Took On Amazon, And Sold It For $3 Billion. Now He\u2019s Thinking About What\u2019s Next\u201d. In the article Cohen says that he is still looking for ways to compete with Amazon and that he thinks they have \u201cChinks in their armor\u201d that he seems to want to expose. What I found the most interesting though was the following excerpt: \n\n&gt;*right now he is trying to figure out what the next \u201csomething\u201d will be for him. \u201cI look at almost everything that comes to me, but I say no to 99.9% of it. \\[...\\] As Warren Buffet says, the difference between successful and really successful people is really successful people say no all the time.\u201d.*\n\n That means that after more than 2 years of searching and looking at different opportunities he decided that Gamestop was the basket he wanted to put all his eggs in. In another article he said \u201cI relished the challenges of disrupting an entire industry and trying to delight customers to a degree that had never been achieved before.\u201d and he has also said in yet another article when asked about the opportunities he sees for himself in the future \"I've been an entrepreneur since my early teens and certainly haven't peaked at age 34!\" \n\nSo genius Ryan Cohen is putting all his eggs into Gamestop, which we have established has insane upward potential,  after more than 2 years of rejecting probably thousands of good opportunities and wants to disrupt an entire industry and clash with Amazon again. Do you really think the \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bs over at Melvin Capital are going to be able to stop him? If not you better tank up on GME shares now that the share price is low or after the potential short term crash following the ICR conference.\n\nPositions: Yolo on GME shares with a target price of $400 to sell \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nPS: For all you illiterate retards out there here is a TLDR in Emojis: \n\nGME \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1a , \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b\ud83d\udd2b, \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c = \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0",

        "selftext": "**In this post we are going to go through an in-depth analysis of AMD\ud83d\ude80, we are going to take a look at their fundamental value, their DCF, do a little technical analysis and set some price targets for the near future and for the long term**\n\n**\\~Very Long Post\\~**\n\nHello everyone! Let\u2019s start by talking a little about [AMD](https://ibb.co/d0cPRrj), they are one of the biggest semiconductor companies in the world, and they operate in multiple segments like Computing, Gaming, Enterprise, Semi-Custom and many more with some of the most important products for the company being microprocessors and GPUs both for personal use like (gaming consoles &amp; PCs) while also offering products for professional use like data centers.\n\nThe company was founded more than 50 years ago and have more than 11K employees, with the company overperforming recently as they have seen a more than 80% rise in the last year.\n\nSo, guys, let\u2019s go a little through the 4th quarter &amp; yearly [results](https://ibb.co/f0CLSF7) for AMD. The company reported a revenue of $3.24B in the 4th quarter, with a 53% growth since last year, while for the full year they earned almost $10B as they more than doubled they quarterly and full year net income, which resulted in a $1.29 earnings/share for the year.\n\nThe [company](https://ibb.co/TY6trfs) has 2 major income segments in Computing &amp; Graphics which brought in sales of over $6.4B for the year and an operating income of $1.26B and the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment which brought in $3.3B in revenues and almost $400M in operating income. They also provide an additional segment that doesn\u2019t bring in any revenues but which represents costs that can\u2019t be associated with any of the other 2 segments, but also includes stock-based compensations and acquisitions related costs.\n\nBoth of these 2 [segments](https://ibb.co/qdfVyrK) have seen huge increases in the past year with operating income doubling for the computing &amp; graphics segment and increasing by almost 50% for the EEC segment.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n[AMD](https://ibb.co/tYmkPwg) didn\u2019t have such a big capital expenditure in 2020, with only $294M but this can increase depending on the demand of their products while they also [adjusted](https://ibb.co/hCtfk2k) their income with $312M in depreciation &amp; amortizations. Both of these numbers have increased by 40 to 50% in the past years and will be important in the DCF valuation. \n\nThey have also managed to increase the gross profit margin to 45%, up 2% from 2019 as their earnings before interest &amp; tax or [EBIT](https://ibb.co/xDptyzW) stood at $1.37B.\n\nThe company has seen a continued earnings per share [growth](https://ibb.co/FhLj0Y7) overall, despite the first 2 quarters of 2020 coming in lower than previous, but that was to be expected as this was impacted by the reduced [revenues](https://ibb.co/QdjCvnx) in Q1 &amp; Q2 before things started to pick up back again, as they finished with a huge increase overall in the 4th quarter.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nTheir product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/YkjNDbY) has become a great challenge to Intel\u2019s market share and is continuing to evolve, as Intel is still struggling to regain momentum with their products.\ud83d\ude80\n\n[AMD](https://ibb.co/XX3h4CD) announced the world\u2019s best processors for laptop and an enterprise variant that is expected to be available in the first half of 2021.\n\nThey have also launched the fastest [AMD](https://ibb.co/fQQnFj4) gaming graphics card ever while also [working](https://ibb.co/D9dDDYs) with big companies like Amazon on their AWS cloud offerings &amp; Microsoft Azure which are planning to use their upcoming 3rd generation EPYC processors.\n\nAMD is also involved in supercomputers which indicates that they are continuing to innovate and develop products that will be in high demand for the foreseeable future\ud83d\ude80\n\nThe one big thing that can propel AMD even more in the future is the proposed acquisition or more rather merger with [Xilinx](https://ibb.co/N2YQFS9) \ud83d\ude80, which also beat earnings expectations the other day, with revenues of over $800M for the quarter and a Free Cash Flow of 44% of their revenues. [Xilinx](https://ibb.co/QH8RTCN) has a market cap of over $32B, and the combination of the 2 companies would [create](https://ibb.co/qJM6Gn4) synergies. [They](https://ibb.co/PcNhH58) are targeting an all-stock transaction which will have implications on my projections, but as time has gone, the $35B price tag is only a 10% premium for Xilinx. The one hurdle the companies have to pass is the regulatory procedures. We will have to wait and see if the deal goes through or not, as it\u2019s expected the deal should be finished by the end of the year, with AMD shareholders retaining 74% of the new group shares and Xilinx holding the remaining 26%.\n\nAMD also offered great [guidance](https://ibb.co/n649gFm) for 2021 as they expect the strength of their product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/Xbx5TV4) to push AMD revenues up 37% over 2020 and also expect their gross margin to increase to 47%, while they [expect](https://ibb.co/RpcwXYr) an effective tax rate for next year of 15%, well belove the 21% US corporate tax rate.\n\nI have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates and expectations. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on\u2026\n\nSo, let\u2019s start with the Unleveraged discounted free cash flow [projections](https://ibb.co/hKFMswn) to see what the current valuation of the company is.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nI used their total revenues projections that we will discuss later on in the long-term projection and the net income for 2020 to which I added back the Depreciation &amp; Amortization costs they had in 2020 and got to a $1.68B EBITDA. \n\nFor the next years I used 1% increase in EBIT margin which I think they can achieve pretty easy and an increase in capex of 10%/year in order to maintain an increased production capacity while also applying a 15% decrease in their net working capital.\n\nSo, for an 8% discount rate, which is pretty much the Average SP500 return, we get a $9.7B Discounted Free Cash Flow by 2025.\n\nNow there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for both of them we do have to subtract or add the net assets or debt, which in this case stands $5.75B in assets. I personally think a use of the average is better suited for most companies, though some of the companies trade largely on the EBITDA approach and other on the growth approach. \n\nIf we use the growth approach, we can see that AMD is pretty fairly valued right now, as this implies a loss of 2%, while on the other hand the EBITDA multiple approach gives us a valuation of over $112, meaning an almost 30% undervaluation of the company. But as I said, I think a use of the average is best, so, my current price target for AMD in 2021 is $98.82, implying a 13.5% return from the last price.\n\nAnd now let\u2019s move on to a longer-term valuation of the company based on the growth projections I have for AMD.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nFor my [projections](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr) I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream. I think we can continue to see 50% growth rate in the EEC segment for 2021 and then implying a gradual slowing of their growth, while for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment I implied a 35% growth, way lower than the over 100% they saw in 2020, also implying a gradual slowdown of the trend by 2025.\n\nI think these growth implications are pretty reasonable giving the high [demand](https://ibb.co/vQFwyRd) the company has seen for their entire product line, especially as gaming revenues have continued to increase, and also taking into account the need for their products in data centers, cloud usage &amp; digital currency mining.\n\nFor their cost of [sales](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr), I started from the current ones which stand at 80% for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment and implied a 1% improvement each year, while for the EEC segment I started from the 88% expense margin right now and implied a gradual 2% improvement. I also maintained their other expense regarding to the cost of sales to 3% of their total revenues, in-line with the previous years.\n\nThis means for [2025](https://ibb.co/swQfJgf) we would get just over $33B in revenues and $26B in expenses, resulting in a gross profit of almost $7B. I also maintained the same capex as in the DCF and also [substracted](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) the interest &amp; other expenses for which I implied a 5% annual growth, thus leading us to a $6.28B in earnings before tax. \n\nI [maintained](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) their 15% effective tax rate projections and also diluted their shares by 1% each year accounting for some dilution in the stock.\n\nSo, for the $5.3B in 2025 revenues after tax and accounting for 1.27B shares, that would mean a $4.21 earnings/share, meaning the [stock](https://ibb.co/HYzfCkz) is trading at 20 times forward price to earnings for 2025.\n\nI like to base my future projections on Forward/PE valuations so, with the current projected PE and depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 25 and 40, the stock can trade between $105 and almost $168.   \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nSo, after all these estimates what are my price targets? [HERE](https://ibb.co/SyN8bn9) are my actual price targets\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \n\nI think the 2025 bear case price we can see AMD trade at is $115 which would imply a return of almost 33% , while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that AMD will trade at 137$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 57% return on the current price. But my most bullish case would see the company trading at $158, which would imply a return of over 81%. So yeah guys, [THIS](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rkJLAXxwqbo6WEfR9NfPEKZagiW4EVbRsz58ejqTVEI) are my Overall price targets for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 25 &amp; 30 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 30 and 35 PE\u2019s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 35-40. \n\nSo [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rkJLAXxwqbo6WEfR9NfPEKZagiW4EVbRsz58ejqTVEI) is the full spreadsheet that I have projected for AMD by 2025, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.\n\nI think these are pretty reasonable [targets](https://ibb.co/9NTJYmP), as the semiconductors industry will keep on booming in the next decade, as the world will need more &amp; more chips that also keep advancing in technology. \n\nThe company also has very good [financials](https://ibb.co/NCtxnFq), with almost $9B in assets vs just $3.1B in total liabilities, which can be easily paid by just the current assets.\n\nAnd let\u2019s also take a look at what the estimates are from the [analysts](https://ibb.co/G0QpnrW). We can only see EPS estimates until 2023 of $3.22, which I think is safe to say can grow an additional dollar by 2025, so my projections are pretty in-line with what other experts anticipate.\n\nSo, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for AMD?\n\nLet\u2019s look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/wQw6CQP), the stock just broke below the long-term uptrend but has seen good support at the $86-87 levels, which is where the next support should stand. We saw AMD pushing towards $100 in the beginning of the year, but it hit major resistance once [Intel](https://ibb.co/pjHdVFQ) also announced a change in their leadership, as they brought in the WMWare CEO Gelsinger, but it\u2019s very hard to see him turn around Intel in a very short time. Intel will need some years &amp; a lot of capital expenditure to turn things around, if they do manage to do it at all. \n\nAMD hasn\u2019t been overbought since August, and currently has an RSI near 41, which is pretty oversold for a good company, so I expect to see them regaining some momentum in the near-term, but I guess the market is very busy with the current short-squeezes. AMD will se a lot of resistance breaking through the $100 level, not because of something fundamental with the company, but I guess it\u2019s a psychological resistance rather.\n\nAnd let\u2019s take a quick look at what 24 [analysts](https://ibb.co/bKRQwXP) on Wall Street are saying. They mostly have a buy call on the company with an average price target of $100 and a high price target of $135. So, I think the analyst are pretty spot on with AMD, but my PT are slightly lower as it\u2019s always better to undershoot and overperform rather than the other way around.\n\nSo, what would I do? Well, I own AMD stock and I believe it still has plenty of room to grow, so I would start building a position right now and add on any weakness, and I would especially buy more if the stock drops even lower than 80$.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nOne last thing to mention about AMD is that they also have a very big % of their [shares](https://ibb.co/zZcxm95) held by institutions, with over 74% of the float being held by big funds like Vanguard &amp; Blackrock which does significantly reduce the sell-off possibilities.\n\nSo, this are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think [Lisa SU](https://ibb.co/X2nVGTF) has done a terrific job since becoming the CEO, and has driven AMD to a renewed approach to their business, as the [company](https://ibb.co/WtBf4yF) has been booming in the past 5 years, growing more than twice as much as Nvidia and crushing the SP500 and Intel\u2019s performance.\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

To just pick a bunch of high risk, high reward long term opportunities, and invest in all of them. If any one or multiple of them pan out, then it'll easily make up for the losers.\n\nSo far I've decided to just completely ignored index funds. Instead I'm just DCAing into whatever I find has huge long term potential based off of what reddit, youtube, motley fool or ARK has hyped up. 80% of my portfolio is in BTC, ETH, TSLA, SQ, LMND, DKNG, uranium stocks, and ARK ETFs.  I'm planning on adding solar and marijuana ETFs.\n\nI've also decided not to sell a single stock no matter what happens, until I have enough to just put everything on VT/VTI and live off of that.\n\nHas anyone else pursued this strategy for the past 4-5 years? If so how did it pan out? When I look at old posts from 2-3 years ago it seems that AMD, MSFT and NVDA were the ones that were hyped up.

        "selftext": "I saw u/Unlucky-Prize post about the technical factors for $GME and felt inspired to make a post about the reasons why I\u2018m long this stock, which is the fundamentals.  I don\u2019t do options or techincal analysis so please refer to other posts for that info.\n\n$GME had been on my radar for quite some time but I finally dipped my toes in two weeks ago.  The basis for that wasn\u2019t the potential for a short squeeze or short interest but the underlying fundamentals behind $GME.  I had posted a long comment in a previous thread and will expand on that to explain why I\u2019m bullish long term for $GME.  I hope this helps.  This post is meant to be a personal opinion and not advice to buy or sell Gamestop.\n\n\ud83d\udc3b Case: \n\n1.  Digital sales will make Gamestop the next Blockbuster.  \n\nThe digital game sales argument, like all \ud83d\udc3b  arguments, are weak.  The shift to digital will possibly occur in the next console cycle.  So maybe the \ud83d\udc3b are right, but they\u2019re right in 8 years which means they\u2019re wrong now.  Additionally digital sales growth has decelerated and are returning to pre-covid levels as more\npeople go back to stores.  This trend should continue if the pandemic improves.  Additionally game publishers don\u2019t care about the fractionally\nlarger margins from selling digital direct.  They only care about moving as many units as quickly as possible.  If they could sell the games on floppy disks they would.  Go read the public filings for any game publisher and they will tell you that they only care about selling what customers want and guess what, they still want physical. \n\nBlockbuster died because Carl Icahn got involved, killed Blockbuster\u2019s attempt to pivot to a Netflix model by offering an online rental service and Blockbuster\u2019s old business model relied on late fees.  Icahn insisted that Blockbuster's greatest asset was its physical location and late fees, killed the pivot and forced them to triple down on their old strategy.  Carl ended up losing 98% of his investment in Blockbuster.  There continues to be demand for physical movie rentals as evidenced by Red Box locations and Netflix still has a few million dvd by mail subscribers.\n\nGamestop has also recently started to pivot away from software sales into other areas and now software sales now make up large minority of Gamestop's total sales.  They're pivoting more towards physical goods and not just Funko Pops but also plan to expand more into new areas like PC gaming and hardware.  \n\nEveryone knows that they signed a revenue agreement with Microsoft where Gamestop will get a cut of the lifetime revenue from Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.  This shouldn't sour the relationship with Sony or Nintendo.  If anything, Sony and Nintendo should be compelled to offer a similar revenue share agreement because Gamestop will inevitably push Microsoft products if Gamestop stand to profit more from it.  This will be a bigger deal in later years as console availability increases and consumers actually deciding to cross shop consoles as opposed to getting whichever new one is available right now.  Sony and Nintendo won't stop selling products through Gamestop because of this agreement with Microsoft, it's too large of a sales channel to give up.\n\n2.  Gamestop will go bankrupt\n\nThis is highly unlikely to happen.  Gamestop managed to survive the single worst brick and mortar retail sales environment in modern history and ended the year with a cash surplus of a few hundred million.  Now its the new year and the beginning of a new console cycle.  This console cycle should last as long as the previous ones which is close to a decade, plus or minus a few years.  During that time, they will be printing money hand over fist selling consoles, new games, used games, accessories, protection plans, etc.\n\n3.  Brick and mortar retail is dead.  Gamestop locations are shutting down left and right, this must mean they're going bankrupt.\n\nGamestop's average lease durations are actually quite short.  A lot of brick and mortar shops have lease duration lasting a decade but the average lease duration for Gamestop is just 2-4 years.  This allows them to close underperforming stores and open new ones very quickly.\n\nGamestop's saw e-commerce grow by 250% last quarter.  The company has been and continues to pivot towards a \"digital-first, omni-channel ecosystem for games and entertainment\"\n\n\ud83d\udc02 Case\n\nThis MOASS could be long and protracted like Tesla in all of 2020 as many continue to bet against Gamestop, instead of a sharp spike like Volkswagen, where Porsche played a large role in spiking the share price.  Keep in mind that at 1x sales, the share price should be $80-100.  Compare that with another retailer Chewy, which has a p/s of 6-7x.  Pet products also has a much lower TAM than gaming.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t even factoring in a complete turnaround that RC has to be planning.  Look at the newest board composition.  Newest members are Reggie (my body is ready), the head of cloud 9 esports, and the current president Petsmart and Chewy. board member.  Ask yourself, are these the people that would join the board of a company that is expected to die in 5 years due to digital game sales.  \n\nThis has moved beyond a short squeeze yolo to a long term hold.  If RC succeeds in transforming this into the next Chewy, you\u2019re looking at a 20x multiple.  This is based on fundamentals and industry tailwinds.  I added 10k shares weeks ago and added 20k shares at $38 because this thing is going much higher and idgaf about a few bucks in share price right now.  Also don\u2019t attempt to time the market because you could be left behind at the launchpad.  \n\nSimply put, if I told you there was a business that served a $200 billion total addressable market with very discerning and loyal customers with a lot of disposable income to spend on this market.  They have over 5,000 retail locations all across the world.  Last quarter, they saw Ecommerce grow by nearly 300% and ended a year where many other brick and mortar retailers went bankrupt with hundreds of millions of dollars in extra cash.  This company has a database called PowerUp consisting of tens of millions of customers that pay them a yearly premium membership.  They're starting a multiyear pivot into several new growing areas and have new board members that are industry leaders in each of those respective areas at the start of a new product launch cycle that will last a decade.  A young visionary founder who made his billions by creating a customer centric experience that defeated Amazon, who is well known to focus on one idea to the point of obsession, just became this company's largest shareholder and now controls the board.  I tell you this company trades at .5 sales.  Would you short or long this company?\n\n\nTLDR:  \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 But not because of the MOASS.",

        "selftext": "I'm in $GME gang deep and wonder if we could pitch some business ideas to Gamestop here. Ryan &amp; the board are likely aware of the subreddit, and there's a lot of attention on it, so maybe in addition to highlighting how much WE LIKE THE STOCK we could also cold pitch some growth opportunities.\n\nI really love the new CEO and board changes, as a Gamestop customer in my youth I even applied to it as my second job. I applied as a store manager, without any managing experience, at 16, because I loved games. I filled out the application and stapled a second, lined notebook paper to the application, which was my \"why do you want to work here\" answer. It was a really long passionate diatribe about my Counterstrike skills developing our clan both during tournaments as well as while we're not gaming by hosting LAN parties and activities. I was serious and was crushed I didn't get a callback. I worked in IS/IT for a few years and moved on. I work in tech now and I have an MBA, and oddly before this week I would never thought to pitch to Gamestop, but I love the idea of pitching Gamestop.\n\nWhy? Gamestop was a portal to reach totally random kids who loved everything I did. We used to all harass our parents to take us to two places: local LAN party joints or Gamestop. We didn't have any money, it was essentially a dumping ground for poor kids, but we'd be respectful of both businesses. Yeah you could meet strangers online, but that's weird (or weirder now than it was then) and I am STILL friends with people I met at LAN parties and Gamestop.\n\nThere's a lot of potential for physical retail spaces and there's time during Covid19 to transform those before we reopen this bitch with a brand new $20B Gamestop in 2021/2022.\n\nCould we remake LAN parties, arcades, all the grimey old 80's spaces that slowly were demolished through the late 90's? The lifeblood of America? Yes we brought gaming \"home,\" and sold more consumer devices, but we lost the in-person human experience. Can we write Gamestop into Stranger Things and every other TV/movie coming out in the next two years to boost the hype train? Yes.\n\nWhat if the game/console sales went the Chewy model (with local pickup if shipping to a residence isn't possible) and the new albeit small retail space was used for game, console, but also STEM/educational programming, bring Black Girls Code in and be inclusive, gamers aren't all blond white boys. My nieces and nephews don't want, despite all my efforts, to play just Warhammer 40k as the Trukk Boyz. My favorite niece does and growls \"WAAAGHHHHH\" but her sister plays Minecraft.\n\nMy friends who are parents, even if they were or are gamers and nerds, are confused about what content is safe for their kids these days. When Among Us came out my sister asked if it was safe for kids.. and I didn't know to be honest. We grew up on Gamestop.. why not have it shepherd the next generation of entertainment through diverse programming and informing parents. Subscribe to Gamespot basic for a newsletter about family friendly games and activities you can play with multiple generations, kids and parents, just kids, just parents, etc. Hype games like Jackbox, not just Cyberpunk.\n\nYou know what everyone pitches and hates pitching? Social media. Social media got too broad, it needs some structure, can we revisit a cross between GameSpy and ICQ that lets you instantly play games with friends, coworkers, family, your kids.. from anywhere? Maybe its an app, maybe its an API, maybe its tied to a platform like Apple messaging but maybe its a PWA and goes anywhere. You can game, but you can also reflect your life and experiences like Instagram (without the privacy/snooping/hate speech) so people can share and grow. Gamespot would regulate the shit out of content with super supportive moderation and a heavy fucking hand.\n\nSimilarly to Gamestop's business partner Microsoft's Xbox, they can help censor and report malicious or offensive content and hate speech in online experiences. That crap has no place. Instead of pitching mountain dew and doritos, jolt cola, top ramen like at LAN parties, sell some nutritious and not too-marked-up food staples because parents will just leave their kids there for a while.\n\nWhile the parents are there, hook them into gaming with their kids, and being gaming mentors for their kids' friends and other folks. Gaming mentors can be a badge, old nerds love that shit, or offer discounts to game subscriptions and services. Mentor/GM/advise parents for X hours and get game exclusives. Teach them that grandma and grandpa like games, that we can all bond through entertainment.\n\nGamestop used to be the linchpin, similarly to GameSpy for finding friends playing games, or ICQ being the communicator, whatever. Game studios threw them away, but lost their ability to talk to their customers. Keep Gamestop retail stores as these mini arcades, basically a fun version of the Apple store, where yeah, you can buy a console and Nintendo minifigs or whatever.. but a kid can use their Gamestop save card and tap into their last progress with some puzzle fighter, or tap in to get an exclusive skin for Minecraft by solving some STEM puzzles, whatever. Don't like retail stores? Great! Get rid of them- we're in an age where you can host wide user research panels through Zoom, Teams, whatever.\n\nGame studios and hardware/console makers can tap into their raw customer base here. Transparently advertise paid panel sessions where actual kids who play the game can just call Blizzard a bag of fucking dicks and Blizzard will pay to hear it. Good developers are desperate to hear feedback, good studios will flock to it, and Gamestop employees are brilliant, they can easily crosstrain as user research panelists/experts. Shit, introduce that into the transaction and sell game studios anonymized customer reports. At checkout or if customers ask about products and services, write it into the process of sales advisement (not pushing games though!) on collecting feedback and make SURE the customer understands their feedback to employees will be used to help shape games- but its anonymized, no user data collected.\n\nWith all this opportunity also comes trust... put trust #1. Microsoft with Satya was all like \"play well with others\" and \"truuuust bitches.\" There's been gaps sure, but them and Apple under Cook are trying (and should) lock advertisers out of their ecosystems. Nobody should be reading your kids' gaming or reading habits, but the parents. Fuck Facebook, fuck Robinhood, etc.\n\nNow this is a low effort elevator pitch but if $GME or any of their partners, potential partners, want to make a play, I'll sign up to write a pitch deck, a one pager, whatever. I'm an MBA in tech, former Gamestop customer, raised in computers.. but I'm also not a gamer. I mostly garden and do outdoor shit, but I still love some wholesome entertainment. Seeing AOC stream Among Us on Twitch with fellow congresswomen blew my fucking mind. Let's fucking do this! Sincerely, *diamond hands*.\n\nPS.. grow from within, Gamestop employees are, I'm sure, itching to get in on ground floor growth. Having a resource like that to tap for leadership opportunities is huge.\n\nPPS.. Sherrilyn Ifill wrote a fucking beautiful report for Starbucks on how to engage communities after Starbucks shit the bed for the .. fourth time or whatever and fucking arrested their own customers for buying coffee while being Black. You want the literal business plan read \"[Toward a Vision for Racial Equity &amp; Inclusion at Starbucks: Review and Recommendations](https://www.demos.org/research/toward-vision-racial-equity-inclusion-starbucks-review-and-recommendations)\" and also buy her books, and watch every recorded lecture of hers you can find online, then contract her &amp; her network to tailor this FOR GAMESTOP. Gamestop was, and is about community- diverse and inclusive community, and racial equity &amp; inclusion should be #1. Growing up in Chicago dragging the few PC's we had to empty corner offices all over the north and south side to hook up and play Command and Conquer, AOE, whatever, that is some shit for everybody. It is the ultimate free childcare for parents. Your kids will play this for TWENTY FOUR HOURS while eating uncooked ramen and BE HAPPY.",

        "selftext": "If any of us makes gains well beyond our imaginations from this, everyone one of us needs to do this one thing. It goes a bit counter to what we do, but it is a price we must accept for the future.\n\nRelative to your personal gains ratio, each one of us after GMEs price normalizes post squeeze, should buy 1, 10, or 100 shares of GME with a promise to yourself and your soul, that no matter what happens to this company, you'll hold the stock for 10 years.\n\nThat you are willing to part with this money in the name of the greater good. Gamestop has had a profound impact on your lives growing up, and now will have in our worst hours (through the pandemic, and with the help of /u/DeepFuckingValue) have done the same yet again.\n\nTheir financials are good, their balance sheet is stable. They've got Ryan Cohen at the helm, a Microsoft partnership towards the future, and aligned to do interesting things in the market. When your mom or dad took you to GameStop as a kid, your eyes lit up. As a teenager and even adult, you've gone there to buy new games and consoles or old games that tug on the heart strings of nostalgia.\n\nSo, that's what we should do. Make sure the this company can help the next generation of degenerates get to experience the same nostalgia we did through the games we played.\n\nThis is the way.",

        "selftext": "Ok, hear me out...\n\nHistory has shown: the 2008 VolksWagen squeeze resulted in VW briefly becoming the worlds most valuable company.\n\nAnd when I say most valuable: I mean MOST valuable. More valuable than Exxon Mobile. More valuable than 2008 Microsoft.\n\nWhat happened to VW was exactly what is happening to GME: well over 100% of the floating stock was shorted.\n\nThesis: GME follows the VW example, and will briefly (probably only for minutes) be worth more than the world's most valuable corp (hint: makes i phones.)\n\nSo, for a $2.3T market cap, using 70M shares, we require a share price of: $32857,-\n\nBacked-up by history, people:\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-idUSTRE49R3I920081028](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-idUSTRE49R3I920081028)\n\nToddler CNBC Anchor to Chamath: \"Wheaaa.... but there are no fundamentals!\"\n\nTo which I say: fundamentals are not important here.

Deliveries become due, and as brokerages go bankrupt, this is what the price will do.\n\nWall Street knows this. Citadel knows this. So they are fighting with blind panic. Throwing everything they can, at it. Including the sabotage of retail investors using Robinhood. NOTE to RH users: get a real bank to execute orders for you.\n\nSo, do you need an exit point? There you have it: price target is $32,000+. Seeing how spotty the broker websites are, I advise you to exit a little before that. But then again, who am I to tell you that?

        "selftext": "What's up everyone. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.\n\n**How can I use this list?**\n\nThe best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. I've displayed the most 'popular' tickers on whichever sub-reddit the post may have originated from. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits.

        "selftext": "I came across this thread on twitter and thought it was a fantastic view on a lot of things from the 90's dotcom bubble. For reference, [please refer to the Twitter thread here](https://twitter.com/corry_wang/status/1345192541545766915) which has some fantastic notes and charts that I did not paste into the transcript below.\n\nSince there have been so many comparisons recently discussing tech froth, I think this is a wonderful share, especially for the majority of people here who were not investors during that time period. Definitely sheds a lot of light on some popular market cliches that misconstrue that period (IE, \"you can only recognize a bubble in hindsight\").  I do not know or follow this person, but still thought this was worth sharing as I came across it.\n\n**Lessons:** \n\nLessons From The Tech Bubble:  Last year, I spent my winter holiday reading hundreds of pages of equity research from the 1999/2000 era, to try to understand what it was like investing during the bubble  A few people recently asked me for my takeaways. \n\nHere they are - Every document hereon comes from my former employer Bernstein Research's internal research archive, which extend back to 1994  Unfortunately, they're not available to the public (even Bernstein's client website cuts off at 2003), but happy to give more details if necessary (see twitter thread for graphic documents).\n\n**LESSON #1**: Everybody knew it was a bubble  Unfortunately, the quip \"it's not a bubble if everyone says it is\" just isn't true  Investors were comparing the internet sector to tulip mania as early as mid-98. Bernstein held an entire conference on it in June 99! \n\n**LESSON #2:** Calling bubbles is easy, making money is hard  In truth, the hard part about the tech bubble wasn't noticing it. The hard part was timing it  Our equity strategist tried in January 99... he was off by 14 months (and another 30 point gap in value vs growth) \n\n**LESSON #3:** Nobody knew the bubble popped until months after it did  Nobody noticed in March 2000 when it finally popped. Our equity strategist (who bet his career on it!) didn't catch on until June \n\n**LESSON #4:** \"Tech\" bubble was a misnomer... it was really a large cap growth bubble  See the valuation table below, 1 year before the top  Yes, Microsoft traded at 70x earnings. But Coca Cola was 43x. Pfizer was 92x. Every stock here was a disaster over the next 10 years... \n\n**LESSON #5:** Most large cap tech stocks in the bubble had real businesses with strong fundamentals  The internet stocks were a sideshow. In 2000, the software sector had a $1 trillion market cap, 20% net margins, 20% annual growth  The problem? It was trading at 16x sales \n\n**LESSON #6:** Fundamentals follow price, not vice versa  The bubble popped in Q1 2000. Fundamentals didn't decelerate until Q4 2000.   It was reflexivity at work. Lower stock prices = less capex spend = less revenue growth = lower stock prices. A vicious cycle \n\nWhat's the takeaway here?   Be humble.  For bears, it's easy to call a bubble. Anybody can do that. Timing is the hard part  For bulls, it's easy to point to the fundamentals. Historical investors weren't dumb. The hard part is matching fundamentals with price...",

        "selftext": "Check my post history, I called this before the first breakout and I\u2019m calling it again. AMC is not only next, it has already started. I expressed the market volume fundamentals the first time, but now I\u2019ll explain why we NEED AMC to be next:\n\n1. It is justified. I love the fucking movies and I reject bankruptcy motivated short sellers who will kill the employment of thousands of people. I reject them, I reject them, I reject them.\n\n2. GME NEEDS to be more than an anomaly. If it is our one and only fuck you to the system then it will be forgotten about. If and WHEN it happens to AMC, this becomes a public strategy. \n\n3. The principle behind GME is also an attack on inequality through a rejection of our current manipulative financial system. Short selling is not just 75% bullshit, during a pandemic it\u2019s 150% blood-seeking. Does anyone really believe AMC would be seeking bankruptcy if not for the pandemic? Hedge fund fucks have been warned \u2014 we are COMING for you. \n\n4. ONE \ud83d\ude80 is NOT enough. We have many \ud83e\udd8d and they have mouths to feed. Institutional investors jump from one concept to another; why the fuck can\u2019t we? Why the fuck shouldn\u2019t we? Trick question: these are our rights as investors.\n\n5. Do people not love the movies? I bought into GME for the cause and because GameStop is a business I support. Frankly, I support AMC even more. I continued being an AMC A-Plus Member through the pandemic because I wanted to support the business. Incidentally, I also hold Apple, Disney, Microsoft, etc. Why is it only okay for me to support and rally for the stock market\u2019s top holdings?\n\n6. Robinhood and other trading platforms restricted multiple stocks, AMC among them. My personal earnings have been manipulated as have yours. And if trading platforms and hedge funds are allowed to do this, it will forever disincentive public participation in the markets. I have a Bullseye on EVERY stock that was restricted \u2014 however, AMC had the most momentum and activity outside of GME, it is continuing to rally, and I will continue to breathe life into it. This level of market manipulation CANNOT be allowed. And, to be clear, this also means I effectively have an ETF at the moment of just stocks that I was told I couldn\u2019t buy \u2014 because why? \u2014 fuck that level of bullshit, that\u2019s why. \n\n7. I am tired of money printing and bailouts being used as the only strategy for saving our economy. PRIVATE CAPITAL should also be SOCIAL CAPITAL. The amount of wealth inequality is fucking insane right now. Never in the history of humanity has the concentration of total assets been held by so few hands. The public can\u2019t have a single approach for generating wealth via a transfer back down the chain? Seriously, not even one?\n\nLook, I have so many more reasons. AMC is due to come back when the pandemic resolves, I love getting handjobs at the movies, I enjoy eating popcorn and watching movies with crowds in front of a big fucking screen and\n\nI LIKE THIS STOCK. WE LIKE THIS STOCK. \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf7f\ud83d\udd25\n\nThis is a French Revolution of the financial industry, and it is over fucking due. \n\nLONG AMC!!!

        "selftext": "**TLDR: If you are pretty sure about what the trajectory of the Georgia Senate Runoffs will be, you can make money. Scroll to the bottom for the plays (for each outcome)**\n\n**Introduction:**  \nAlmost everyone on this sub knows QQQ. Now, recall the price action around Nov. 3 (or if you can't because you're that guy from the movie Memento, pull out your Robinhood app and follow along with me kid).  \n\nOn the eve of the general election, when the so-called pollsters said it would be a Democratic sweep, QQQ sat at $269. The next day, with the election contested, QQQ rocketed to $294. It remained steady on Friday, before declining the next week.  \n\nWhy did the election affect the price the way that it did? Well, it's because Biden's legislative agenda depends on Democratic control of Congress. In particular, he can raise corporate taxes with just a simple majority in the Senate.  \n\nThe institutional whales (the folks who actually move markets) believe that:\n- Companies that benefitted bigly from Trump's tax cuts (tech companies especially) will be hurt by Biden raising taxes.\n- Companies that would benefit from fiscal stimulus (green new deal, infrastructure) will be helped by by Biden's plans, and even more if Biden controls Congress.  \n- Regardless of who controls the Senate, the divided nature means some companies are guaranteed to benefit.\n\nDon't take my word for it. Read this report from Goldman Sachs (p.15-16): https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/beyond-2020-post-election-policies-f/report.pdf   \n\nOriginally, tech companies (facing more regulation and tax increases under the Democratic Trifecta) was trending down. But then, when it became clear the Republicans would hold the Senate and taxes weren't going up, tech stocks soared. Yet, suddenly, there was a small blip downward the next week. Why? Because David Perdue (R) was headed to a runoff, injecting the possibility that Democrats still had a chance to control Congress.  \n\n**Which stocks are impacted, and why**\n\nIf Democrats gain control of the U.S. Senate, that means Biden can pass his legislation.\n- Some companies will be helped bigly (e.g. Renewables)\n- Some companies may be hurt (more taxes) but also helped (more fiscal spending)\n- Some companies may be hurt bigly (more taxes, regs, and less gov't subsidies)\n\n\nTo make this a pure election-related play, we want to trade:\n- companies that benefit bigly from Democratic legislation (and don't have short-term non-political risk)\n- companies that are hurt bigly from Democratic legislation (and don't have short-term non-political risk)\n\nSo what companies benefitted the most from Trump's tax cuts? (Source: Goldman Sachs Client note)  \n- Tech companies like Netflix, which saw its effective tax rate go from 23% to 7%.\n- Railroad companies like CSX, which saw its effective tax rate go from 37% to 23%.\n- Healthcare companies like HCA, which saw its effective tax rate go from 32% to 20%.\n- Pure financial companies like CME, saw its effective tax rate go from 36% to 23%.\n\nObviously, pandemic-related questions muddle price-action on healthcare. At the same time, there is still some policy uncertainty to what will happen to railroads regardless of the outcome of the runoffs (they will have higher taxes, but that may be offset by stimulus/infrastructure spending). That leaves two sectors as our pure election plays:\n- Tech companies will get more regulation and higher taxes if Biden takes Senate\n- Financials will get more regulation and higher taxes if Biden takes Senate\n\nOut of those sectors, specific companies may be overvalued or undervalued, and other concerns may matter more than legislative impact by the U.S Congress. For example, BABA is a tech company in QQQ, but as a Chinese company it sure isn't going to impacted much by U.S. tax legislation. We can just ignore it.\n\nHowever, a U.S. company like NFLX which is a bit overpriced and very exposed to a tax-cut rollback, is an excellent bear trade for a Democratic Senate scenario (especially if corporate tax increases start being mentioned). While MSFT, which is slightly under-valued and also exposed to tax increases, may be a good trade against a Democratic Senate.  \n\n\nInformation about the races to consider:\n- In the November General election:\n\t- Perdue (R) won 49.7 percent of the vote, while Ossoff (D) won 47.9 percent. In other words, Ossoff substantially underperformed Biden.\n\t- The Republican candidates (Loeffer + Collins) won a combined 49.4 percent, while the Democratic candidates (Warnock et al) won a combined 48.4 percent.\n\t- These are both substantial leads for the Republicans.\n- The \"reputable\" polls:\n\t- Republican-leaning Trafalgar Group (\"most accurate pollster of 2016\"), which had Trump up 3-4% in its November poll (i.e. 3-4% wrong), has now pegged both the Democratic candidates leading slightly in its late December poll.\n\t- Democratic-leaning Survey-USA (which has pretty accurate polling) had Biden up 1-2% in its last general election poll, is now predicting a Democratic sweep in its late December poll\n\t- Poll to Watch: AJC/UGA, with polling by UGA Professor Trey Hood (the most accurate major poll this year for Georgia). This will be released soon.\n- The Rev. Raphael Warnock is currently in divorce proceedings, and was recently accused by his wife of running over her foot with his car. Watch for whether this gains any traction (or at least enough to sway swing voters)\n\n\nThe plays:\n- If you expect both Democratic Senate candidates to sweep (both 2%+), then AGGRESSIVELY short QQQ, NFLX, CME, and long green energy + industrials (e.g. etfs like TAN and Solar stocks like ENPH). I would buy weekly Jan. 8 FD puts.\n- If you expect both Democratic Senate candidates to win with a significant margin (both 0.5%+), short QQQ, NFLX, CME. I would buy puts for Jan. 15/22, since the counting might drag on a few days.\n- If you expect Republicans to comfortably hold at least one seat, long QQQ (specifically NFLX, FB, and MSFT) for Jan. 15\n- If you expect Republicans to sweep, long QQQ and short green energy for Jan. 15.\n- If you expect it to be unclear whether Republicans can hold at least one seat (think month-long recount), long vega on QQQ &amp; NFLX with a bearish tilt. This would be a short vertical call spread, or buying a medium-term strangle. \n- If you expect Trump to still be President on Jan 22 following the events of Jan. 6, aggressively short SPY and long MAGA because a civil war is probably coming.",

        "selftext": "**DO NOT LISTEN TO PEOPLE SAYING NOK HYPE ARE BOTS. THESE ARE FUDDERS TRYING TO GET IN CHEAPER OR EXIT POSITIONS. THE HYPE IS REAL**\n\nNokia is now a market leader in networking and enterprise level technology, essentially providing infrastructure for all types of networks. They also manufacture telecommunications equipment and engage in licensing. The most exciting opportunity in their current business model is 5G, which could be the main catalyst for this seemingly boring stock to finally break through resistance and become a valuable asset in portfolios. I'll give some key updates and price targets below.\u00a0\n\n\nPartnerships and beneficiary of 5G rollouts\n\n\nFor starters, it's been a common thesis that 5G will be the greatest investing opportunity of the decade, yet Nokia remains in a flat/downward pattern on the chart. They've recently earned several contracts that will give them a stronger moat in the 5G domain as well as steady revenues and growth opportunities. Recent contracts come from a very diverse group of partners, including:\u00a0\n\n-A 5 year deal with T-Mobile, in which T-Mobile will power it's 2.5GHz mid-band spectrum using Nokia's AirScale Radio platform. In addition, Nokia will facilitate T-Mobile to upgrade it's mid-band LTE network to a 5G network.\u00a0\n\n-Secured a government contract via the\u00a0National Cybersecurity Center for Excellence. Nokia was selected as the tech provider and collaborator for the 5G Cybersecurity Project. The federal agency plans to utilize Nokia's technology for the transition to 5G from 4G. The project intends to identify 5G use cases to highlight the efficacy of the components of 5G architecture against security threats as part of a government initiative to beef up it's cyber security and anti-spying tools.\n\n-Partnership with Google Cloud\u00a0in which the 2 firms will work in unison on businesses' digital transformation at the network edge through both 5G connectivity and cloud-native applications and capabilities. The partnership's purpose is to develop solutions for communication service providers to modernize network infrastructure and ensure smooth transitions to cloud-native 5G-core. This will likely build an ecosystem of services that deployable anywhere, from network edge, to public clouds, private clouds, and carrier networks.\u00a0\n\n-Nokia has also recently announced\u00a0partnerships with M1\u00a0for 5G solutions in Singarpore, as well as\u00a0TeleZ\u00a0to deploy key infrastructure solutions for TeleZ subsribers in Sweden, Lativa, Lithuania, and Estonia. They were also awarded a contract by NASA for $14.1 million to build 4G infrastructure on the moon.\u00a0\n\n\nNokia has more than 220 large enterprise customers across industries worldwide, of which at least 30 have deployed 5G. They were also in a geopolitical battle in which the U.S. expressed interest in owning a piece of the company, and in response Finland built it's stake in Nokia via Solidium Oy, the state's equity-asset manager, to 1 billion euros($1.2b usd). Nokia also intends to repurchase 500 million shares in the coming months, so demand for the stock is picking up on all levels.\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition to infrastructure, licensing is a huge part of Nokia's business model that will benefit from 5G. The \"Nokia Technologies\" Arm handles patent licensing, technology licensing, and brand licensing. This includes an industry-leading patent portfolio including ~20,000 patent families including ~3500 5G standard essential patent families.\u00a0\n\n\nSo why is a company with so many valuable assets and recently announced deals/partnerships still trading flat and so seemingly undervalued? The short answer is the former CEO made several bad choices which gave Nokia's competitors an upper hand on the current 5G landscape and put NOK share price in a long term downtrend which has gave it a reputation as a boring stock with an ugly chart. However, with new CEO Pekka Lundmark's expertise in driving returns to shareholders, as well as the scrutiny and subsequent bans of Huawei opening the door for competition, Nokia now has a much needed breath of life and a chance to gain market share to become the biggest beneficiary of the 5G revolution. The new CEO is determined to get Nokia to the top and pull in solid returns to shareholders, as evidenced by the slew of recent contracts/partnerships along with his plans for spending aggressively on R&amp;D, as well as developing a leaner business model by cutting unnecessary expenses and unprofitable endeavors.\u00a0\n\n\nNokia is primed for growth as they plan into several emerging, high growth markets including 5G, IoT, Edge computing, Network Encryption, Cloud Radio Access, Software Defined Infrastructure(SDI), Cloud Managed LAN, Optical Communications and Networking, as well as established high growth markets such as Smart Wearables, Defense/Security, and LTE.\u00a0\n\n\n\nDespite the slew of positive news surrounding Nokia and their partnerships/contracts, the stock is still very undervalued, even at today's price surge. \n\nThat may soon change, as the stock's chart is beginning to signal incoming volatility. The implied volatility(IV) and volume for NOK call options are indicating big moves in the coming months. Open interest is on the rise as well.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nNOK is trading at a\u00a0Price/Book ratio\u00a0of\u00a01.3x, compared to it's peers average of\u00a04.0x\u00a0and the sector average\u00a02.2x\u00a0\n\nNOK is also undervalued in terms of\u00a0Price/LTM sales. It has a ratio of\u00a00.9x, it's peers trade at an average of\u00a03.9x, and the sector average of\u00a01.8x\n\nTo establish the Fair Value Estimate, we'll use 2 models taking input from previous NOK financials, as well as data from competitors. (Competitors include: CSCO, ERIC, MSI, MSFT, and AAPL.\n\nP/E Multiples:\u00a0$14.94\u00a0target\u00a0\n\nEarnings Power Value:\u00a0$15.64\u00a0target\u00a0\n\nThe average for the 2 models imply a\u00a0Fair Value Estimate\u00a0of\u00a0$15.29 \n\n\n\n\nThese estimates are based on historical data, therefore are fair values for the current price and past performance, not taking into account the market share and recurring revenue recently secured. I believe over the 3 months ad beyond the fair value will be much higher as earnings begin to reflect the value and growth from 5G contracts and recurring revenues.\u00a0\n\n\nEven currently, those estimates are a bit low as Nokia's closest competitor, Ericsson, has a market cap that is nearly 70% higher than Nokia, despite the two having very similar financials and even trailing Nokia in several key metrics.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAt NOK's current share price of, it remains undervalued as ERIC is only ahead of NOK in 2 key categories, EBITDA and Profit Margin, and ERIC is only outperforming NOK by a slim margin in these categories. I believe NOK should be valued much higher, than ERIC since they are gaining contracts MUCH faster than ERIC and also Huawei, which would imply a share price of\u00a0$7.11\u00a0before any buybacks place shares into the treasury, which would increase the price even further.\u00a0\n\n\nNokias Fair value is over $25\n\nThis is based on competitor ERIC who is valued 68.4% higher despite having trailing NOK in almost every key metric for valuation, and the valuation of Huawei who is losing tons of revenue and contracts in favor of Nokia",

        "selftext": "Before diving in, a few housekeeping items:\n\n1. **I didn't write this.** Everything below has been copied and pasted from [Chris Bloomstran](https://twitter.com/ChrisBloomstran/status/1345155266468306944)'s Twitter feed. All I've added are a few edits for brevity. If you have a Twitter account, definitely give him a follow.\n2. \"**OP is a gay bear.\"** Full disclaimer, I neither own puts nor am short Tesla (although I'm definitely considering it). In fact, if Tesla were cheaper I would almost definitely be long. I'm posting this because, beneath all of the memes and shitposting, I know that all of us want to make money. Every little bit of information/analysis helps, even if we disagree with the end-conclusion.\n3. **\"Post is too long. Ban.\"** This post isn't meant for you, please move along. I know it's wordy and there aren't any pictures, but this is meant for those in this sub who enjoy a bit of reading/research. If you aren't interested in a bit of reading, please scroll past.\n4. **If you YOLO $TSLA puts because of this post, you deserve to lose your money.**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n***A single prediction for the New Year.***\n\n*Those unfamiliar with the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Regulation T will hear lots about it during 2021. The rule limits the percentage of an investment in equity securities that can be borrowed with a margin loan. A wake-up call is scheduled...*\n\n*It was widely reported this week that total margin debt reached a new high of $722B. The WSJ\u2019s 12/28 lead Business and Finance story profiled a $TSLA retail investor, a civil engineer, who had parlayed a $23k option investment in $TSLA into a $2m position. Oh boy. The gentleman is to surely and genuinely be commended for the investment. An 87x gain in a short period is extraordinary (I've never done that, nor will I). That said, a quick perusal of $TSLA twitter commentary and recommendations is terrifying.*\n\n*One can read the Journal article,* [*Investors Double Down on Stocks, Pushing Margin Debt to Record TSLA*](https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-double-down-on-stocks-pushing-margin-debt-to-record-11609077600)*, and draw two conclusions. One, \u201cThis must be extremely dangerous,\u201d or two, \u201cSurely I can get rich quick too.\u201d Human nature being what it is\u2026 For the latter, the civil engineer offers this advice on his Twitter page, \u201cIf you have no Tesla call options, you may want to do the math and consider using LEAPS as a way to accelerate your accumulation of Tesla stock. 40X in 2020. Another 50X by 2025.\u201d Whoa.*\n\n*A series of Q&amp;A tweets ensues (thanks for the heads up* [*@RomanRubinstein*](https://twitter.com/romanrubinstein?lang=en)*) on which broker/dealers offer the most margin, the lowest interest rate on margin debt, and how to borrow the most money and obtain the maximum leverage by purchasing call options. \u201cMaintain margin value of 50% in my portfolio and the margin borrowing rides forever,\u201d goes the advice. Please consider the danger of heeding this advice. The engineer should risk-off and live a happy life.*\n\n*A whole bunch of people are going to lose a whole bunch of money.*\n\n*Reading through a series of tweets among the Tesla (and others) option crowd, you see little, if any, mention of maintenance margin requirements. FINRA requires investors, strike that, speculators, to maintain equity of at least 25% of the value of an account. Leverage kills. Maintenance rates can be set above the minimum threshold. The concept of posting shares in stocks like $TSLA, $TWTR, or any established company trading for 20x or 30x sales &amp; borrowing half of the value and then buying calls on the same shares posted as collateral is insanity. The only \u201cmath\u201d a speculator should be doing is knowing at what price against the shares in the account will new equity be required. Most brokers don\u2019t wait around for a customer to come up with new cash or securities to deposit. What do they do?*\n\n*They sell down your shares to get to equity compliance. More decline? More forced selling. Depending on maintenance margin thresholds, you can lose it all in a hurry. Red flags are abundant, beyond simply the new record high in total margin and credit market debt outstanding. You can see the bubble in the number of single-contract call options outstanding, in the number of new retail accounts being opened with margin and allowed option trading, and even in the tone of surety by speculators regarding prospects for wildly expensive shares like Tesla.*\n\n*I never thought I\u2019d again see the kind of mania like we saw in the late 1990\u2019s, but here we are. Memories of what can and is likely to happen are long gone. Even a number of professional investors have suspended price as a key determinant of value.  A respected and well-known retired professional investor suggested on Twitter recently that I don\u2019t understand \u201c$TSLA growth math or basic investment theory,\u201d that \u201cstocks look forward, not backward\u201d and that \u201cP/E\u2019s are a function of exponential growth rates, not industry.\u201d*\n\n*The last time an investment pro came unglued was January 2000 at a newspaper roundtable. The C.I.O/PM for one of the largest &amp; oldest growth &amp; income funds at the time took exception to the notion that $MSFT shareholders would lose money for the next 15 years, which they did. I\u2019d written 6 pages on the prediction in my 1/1/2000 letter (on the website) and discussed it at the roundtable. My co-panelist became unhinged because he and his firm had 5% of capital in $MSFT, which was then a $620B market cap on $20B in sales, 31x sales &amp; 80x earnings.*\n\n*You can apply the same logic to $TSLA or to any number of dangerously overvalued fashionable disruptive growers today. The Tesla bull proffering margined purchase of $TSLA LEAPS expects a $1,000 share price this year, $5,000 the next and $22,000 by 2025.*\n\n*Now, a $22,000 stock price, assuming no further dilution above today\u2019s 1.1B fully diluted shares outstanding, gets you to a $24 trillion market value, which must be reasonable given that the entire market value of the S&amp;P 500 today is only \\~$31 trillion &amp; global GDP is $88T. When your TAM (the new eyeballs) is 100% global auto market share, robotaxi, energy grid, insurance and economic population of Mars, no price is too high. No argument that Tesla has made great strides in manufacturing efficiency and are now producing a more reliable product.*\n\n*I also believe disruption of the auto industry will require an enormous amount of capital to grow and the established OEM\u2019s won\u2019t play dead. You can't simply separate auto margins and capital requirements from nearly infinite profitability earned by selling software upgrades. Shouldn\u2019t the upgrades be considered part of total vehicle cost? To what extent did the Apples and Microsofts of the world thrive on a regular upgrade cycle, much of which was and is planned. How often are you compelled into a new iPhone or iPad? Prior to the subscription model, at what point did Microsoft not support an older operating system or Office suite? Will EV buyers purchase a new car every 2-3 years? How much of the world can afford a more expensive vehicle than the current global average car price?*\n\n*Regardless of one's beliefs on business quality &amp; growth prospects, paying a too-high price can destroy future investment return. #neversell? When price becomes ridiculous to the most optimistic business case you #bettersell. Price matters and the current environment is nuts. The current folly for price not mattering, or being justifiably high, reminds me of a well known sell-side report on Berkshire Hathaway in 1998 which assumed as undervalued both $BRK\u2019s shares and its stock portfolio against an assumed \u201creasonable\u201d 40x market multiple.*\n\n*Berkshire\u2019s shares, expensive, would fall by half over the next 18 months to a February 2000 low. It\u2019s become fashionable to explain investment process by saying price is the last consideration. Too often lately, price isn\u2019t even a consideration, especially for holy growers. While I did not have a short position on $MSFT in 2000, I do have a very small recent short on Tesla today so take my comments w/ a grain of salt. I did buy $MSFT in '06 after it fell by \\~75% and owned it for a decade, trimming when dear and adding to the position when cheap.*\n\n*Short selling is very risky and those w/ sizable short positions on Tesla at the outset of 2020 would have suffered real damage given the 720% advance during the year. I've read that shorts lost $38B during '20 alone on their collective positions &amp; short interest is way down. I happen to think the valuation is now so large to protect against a continued runaway price, particularly now that* u/elonmusk *secured its entry in the S&amp;P 500 by engineering 4 quarters of profits by cutting R&amp;D, SG&amp;A and thanks to environmental credits courtesy $GM &amp; $FCA.*\n\n*Still, I\u2019d never employ a large short position given unlimited downside and a max return of 100%. Margin is required against short positions. What appears to be a growing army of retail option traders, many employing sizable margin debt, is a recipe for disaster. Price and quality conscious investors get uncomfortable at times like these. I am extremely uncomfortable. I hope those that have no idea what they are doing heed growing and now very high risk and fully understand downside and what margin calls and maintenance margin mean.*\n\n*Many, many speculators will lose much and even all of their money at some point as this bubble breaks. Now is the time to reduce risk. You could feel badly for employees that were paid in non-qualified stock options and kept their shares upon exercise in the late 1990\u2019s. When shares plummeted in the wake of the tech bubble the tax liability due on gain realized as income upon exercise was still due and payable, despite shares that were way below the exercise price. It was bad. Many lost everything but weren\u2019t in a position to understand risk.*\n\n*Borrowing against Tesla (or any) shares and buying call options presents serious deliberately assumed risk. For perspective, a 92% decline takes the shares back to where they started 2020! With margin, it will take way less than a 92% decline to introduce wipeout.*\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Responding to a PM who claims that the $TSLA price target of $1,200, total EV adoption of 20%, and 5% market share in global auto-manufacturing is reasonable, Bloomstran had this to say:**\n\n*You have EV adoption rising from 3% to 20% in five years, a 6x increase (46% CAGR) and Tesla market share at 25%. 2019 global new vehicle sales totaled \\~95m units and will be way lower this year. Let's call 2020 a throwaway for the industry, and hats off to* [*$TSLA*](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&amp;src=cashtag_click) *for growing. From the 2019 base, if we assume 4% market growth then new global units in 2025 would be 115m and at your expected 20% share Tesla would sell 29 million vehicles. Is this your assumption? Sounds aggressive given Tesla\u2019s 500k unit run rate for 2020 and 1/2% market share.*\n\n*Now, US new vehicle prices are $38k but significantly lower worldwide, let\u2019s say $30k per vehicle sold globally. The average Tesla looks to range from high $30k\u2019s for the Model 3 to $55k for the Model 3 Performance to $125k for the Model X Performance fully loaded.  What do you expect for an average selling price for Tesla in 2025? I\u2019d presume that as market share expands ASP\u2019s will have to fall to affordable. I\u2019m trying to get to a revenue number.*\n\n*Perhaps the governments of the world will be giving $2k per person, $8k per family of 4 in annual perpetuity, surely making new cars more affordable! If Tesla sells 29m units in 2025 @ $34.5k per unit, that gets sales to $1 trillion, a CAGR of \\~102% for five years. Reasonable?*\n\n*Moving on, you have a 2025 EPS target of $24/share. On how many shares shall we apply your expected per-share figure? Shares outstanding at 9/30 totaled 948m, up from 905m at yearend 2019. An additional $5B in shares were sold recently to the public in \u201cat-the-market\u201d sales.  The sales were done with no roadshow, risk disclosure or prospectus, unless Goldman\u2019s report upgrading the shares from neutral to buy &amp; a new price target of $780, up from $455, issued days before the announced sale and Goldman\u2019s retention as selling agent, as a \u201cprospectus.\"*\n\n*If the shares were sold at an average of \\~$600/share, the share count would now be 8.3m shares higher, so call the total 956m. You have a price target of $1,200 for the shares, so let\u2019s not forget to include in the count any option and RSU shares issued but not yet exercised.  Recall,* [*@elonmusk*](https://twitter.com/elonmusk) *was granted 20m option shares (now 100m thanks to the split) in 2018 by* [*@larryellison*](https://twitter.com/larryellison) *and Elon\u2019s associates on the board. Fully diluted shares total 1.113B right now, and if the stock keeps rising we can assume all options will be exercised and outstanding.*\n\n*So, how many shares should we apply to your $24 EPS target? If we assume zero further dilution (realistic?), then using the 1.113B fully diluted shares including the recent $5b sale, we get to $26.7B in net income. On an even $1 trillion in revenues, that\u2019s a 2.67% profit margin, just a bit higher than the auto industry average of 3% and approaching $MSFT\u2019s 30%.*\n\n*One last missing piece of information, which I haven\u2019t seen mentioned by the Tesla bulls or in your message to me is how much capital will be required to grow sales from 500k units to 29m over the next 5 years?  It looks like over the history of* [*$TSLA*](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&amp;src=cashtag_click) *the company has raised $26.5B in equity capital (including the recent $5B) and $16.5B in debt and preferred equity, so a total of $43B. Tesla has a cumulative loss of $5.7B, so it hasn\u2019t produced a positive return on capital.*\n\n*For its last 4 quarters GAAP profits totaled $5.56B, which yields a 2.5% return on capital (equity net of retained losses plus debt minus cash, all adjusted for the recent $5B sale). I fully understand companies can surely lose money or earn little profit as they scale.  With the recent sale of $5B Tesla now has \\~$20B in cash. Is this sufficient to finance its growth over the next 5 years as the company grows units by 102% per year?*\n\n*Since I don\u2019t lean on brevity and given my lack of understanding of basic investment theory, let\u2019s summarize the missing data points necessary to get the stock to your target of $1,200 per share, 50 times your 2025 EPS target of $24 per share. Needed: 1) Tesla unit sales in 2025? 2) Average selling price per unit? 3) Any non-auto related sales \u2013 insurance, robotaxi, insurance, energy sales? 4) Shares outstanding? 5) Total capital: Additional paid in capital, debt, preferred equity, cash?*\n\n*At your 50x $24 EPS $1,200  price target,* [*$TSLA*](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&amp;src=cashtag_click) *returns 11.2% pa from Thursday\u2019s $705.67 close. I happen to think shares in* [*$BRK*](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BRK&amp;src=cashtag_click)*, my largest holding, are likely to compound at roughly that rate, assuming a 10% ROE and a terminal price at 1.3x book value, up from \\~1.2x today.*",

You would be right, during the 2 week timeline things look pretty normal.\n\nNow let's look what has happened since **shit hit the fan** on Thursday (28th) after Robinhood started to limit the buys on meme stocks and **EVERYONE** started to talk about wsb and retail investors hunting stocks with high short %.\n\n**Timeline: January 28th - January 29th**\n\nSelected stocks &amp; indices:\n\nS&amp;P 500 -1,14%\nNASDAQ -2%\nAAPL -5,3%\nMSFT -1,8%\nFB -7,3%\nTSLA -2,5%\nGOOGL -0,5%\n\nEverything is red. Why is that weird? For one FB, MSFT, AAPL actually **all beat earnings** released last week (TSLA missed). Why are investors not piling onto these stocks? There's multiple reasons and here's where the **nuclear bomb theory** comes into picture. I suggest you put on your cloak and wizard hat it's about to get retarded.\n\nI believe the smart money realized what's about to happen and are exiting their long positions. By smart money I'm referring to hedge funds like Melvin Capital who are losing $3B a month. Even you degenerates here have exited your other positions and YOLO'd into GME and AMC. As many people here with IQ above 80 have earlier stated a lot of these hedge funds are piled onto the same long and short positions. The biggest short positions they're in are most likely all in the red because the short squeeze frenzy happening. They're scared shitless over the idea they might be caught in a situation like Melvin where they need to be bailed out by buddies or even worse, go tits up. Some of them saw this earlier and probably were smart enough to cover and close their shorts. Some of them have not covered or even worse may have doubled down on shorts. Since last Thursday these clowns have a planet full of \ud83d\udc8e\u270a retards bidding up their short positions.\n\nI believe to avoid blowing up their chad funds, on Thursday and Friday they started to liquidate their long positions to be able to cover the short positions. What happens when a bunch of these suits start exiting at the same time? It tanks the stock (which I believe is happening to AAPL, MSFT, FB and many others, possibly the whole market). This leads to a cycle where even more funds want to liquidate long positions because suddenly they're losing money on the shorts (mooning) and longs (tanking). Remember these people are leveraged **TO THE TITS** so in an event where they're losing on all fronts they may be forced to liquidate positions to avoid margin calls.\n\nMoving capital from their longs to cover their short positions will make things **even worse** for the not so smart funds that have not yet covered. High short % stocks will moon even harder due to other funds covering and the boomer long positions they are in will drill down even more. \n\nIn this situation GME and AMC are **Little Boy** and **Fat Man** (read your history kids). They are the first and the second **Nuclear Bomb** to drop. They will suck all the surrounding capital into a mushroom cloud ascending into the stratosphere. Why are GME and AMC blowing up especially bigly? Because they do shit even your 90 year old grandma can understand. Depending how the situation evolves, other high short % stocks may or may not join them in their ride to the heavens (my opinion is they will be duds). I'm seeing a lot of turmoil in the upcoming weeks, look at what happened to VIX last week.\n\nPositions: Cash gang, GME \ud83d\udc8e\u270a and \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bSPY FDs\n\nHope you all have a great weekend!\n\nAlso, \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "* After a hiatus due to GME craze, reeeeecaps are back for a limited time. The broader market took a nose dive today as volatility resume in earnest due to, of all things, fucking meme stocks. As GME, AMC, KOSS, and others continue their large swings to the stratosphere much to the grief of short sides, chatters are now about that sell-offs are partly a liquidity issue as funds close out their long position to cover (and prevent a margin call) on their deiminated short positions in GME et al. VIX continues the spike from Wednesday and was up as high as 19% as systemic risk to the market are now fully in the spotlight.\n\n* During intraday low, the DOW was down as much as -747 pts while SPX was down -94 pts and Chadsdaq was down -352 pts. Almost all sectors are being punished while a few medical products company in SPX escape into the greens due to a strong ER and an overall strengthen demand - cuz there's a fucking global pandemic. TMO is up 2.93% for the day to $511 while DHR is up 4% to $237. Conversely, big tech are big fucked as AAPL, FB, and MSFT are all down significantly. AAPL closed down -3.74%, FB down -2.52%, and MSFT closed down -2.92% (despite a strong ER result earlier in the week). AMZN, GOOGL, and NFLX are all down around -1%.\n\n* GME swings to a strong green opening after RH relents being a shill bag for Citadel, allowing limited GME and AMC trading (to one or five fucking shares? what a joke). Turns out when the product is free, you're the product? In yet another volatile session, intraday high was at the opening $413 and intraday low was at $250 (a 40% intraday move) as MMs clear out their delta and escapes a total gamma squeeze to live yet another day. The short squeeze, however, is still in play as GME closes up 68% to close at $325, thanks to a reversal of movement shortly before power hour. As of writing, short sellers are at mark-to-market loss of almost 20 bil. You gotta feel for them as they might need to downgrade from a super yacht to a pleb boat. Such shame.\n\n* Congress critters, media pundits, and everyone's moms continue to give their 2cents on the GME and gang episode - and while consensus is usually in favor of the little guys, being a cynical F - you should expect regulations and further restrictions  from regulators/industry moving forward. One likely curb to help save MMs would be restricting options trading to certain account size, or further restricting access to 0dte, particularly for volatile underlyings. Expect all this to come out with messaging of \"helping to protect our customers.\"\n\n* RoaringKitty AKA DFV gets [nice profile from the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/technology/roaring-kitty-reddit-gamestop-markets.html) and if you are one of the few millions who are new to the story + sub, the piece does a good job giving a history of how DFV got started. Yours truly somehow got quoted in the piece as well and while the quote was decisively retarded as F, no cap it was an accurate description of most of our mindset. (Of all the fucking quotes to pick out from his updates since 2019...)\n\n* If you're unhappy with your broker due to restrictions, select veteran brokerages such as Fidelity, Vanguard, ETrade, has placed zero restriction (short of whatever that is already existed) on meme stock trading. As it turns out companies with decent corporate value are actually NOT dick bags, even in the face of market volatility. (Sure their UI might be stuck in the 90s and early 2000s). Things are especially helpful as these brokerages do their own clearing and aren't beholden to Citadel and others. While brokers who use Apex as a clearing house has had limited time restriction (Ally, TDA, Tasty etc.) they are definitely far better than whatever RH has done to their customer.\n\n* Notable upgrades and downgrades: Despite receiving a strong upgrades this AM, BA couldn't handle overall macro pressure and its green opening of +2% swung to red as the day chugs on. Morgan Stanley double upgraded Boeing to overweight form underweight with a PT of $230, up from $165. BA closed the day down -1.54% to $194, further contributing to DOW's demise. SFIX, who rode quite a bit of the short squeeze mania in recent days (from $55 to $100 within two weeks) was hit with a downgrade by Baird as they notch the shares down to neutral from outperform with a PT of $85. SFIX closed the day down -4.44% to $95. GM, who's looking more and more likely to be the next strong EV contender receives another PT hike to $80 from $57 by Morgan Stanley. Shares remain unchanged given the recent run-up and closed the day flat at -0.7% to $50.68.\n\n* After a decent rally from ER, AAL immediately sets out to offer another round of 1 bil in stocks, further fucking over their long term boomer shareholders. Already selling 1 bil in stock back in Oct of last year, the new offering will be selling up to 1.12 bil in more. Shares of American Airline close the day down -5% to $17. Others in the sector are also down, particular as UAL warns that thousands of job are at risk again - despite a 15 bil handout from the recent stimulus package. UAL close down -6% to $40, DAL down -5.29% to $38. Meanwhile JBLU and LUV handles the sector news a bit better given their management isn't complete trash.\n\n* In WSB meme stock land, everything is a fucking meme stock now. AMC close the day up 53% back above $13. BB, a stock without the short squeeze factor closed the day down -3.75% to $14. If you like the previous DDs and plays on BB - you can always regrab $15c or $20c leaps when IV has cool down some more after VIX has retreated. As of writing Jan 22 and Jan 23 leaps are still looking at 140-150% IV. Which is a bit too expensive in premium. ICLN retreats yet again, down -3.3%. MT is down -3.8% after running up almost 7% the day before, and PLTR close the day down -1.35% to $35 ish. TSLA took another haircut of -5% to close out at $793, furthering yesterday's decline after an ER profit miss that didn't impress the market. Yeah, you almost forgot about all these tickers, didn't ya?\n\n* Looking for a bullish meme stock play but just can't stomach the IV or premiums level and shares are too boomer (or out of reach in the case of GME lol)? Thanks to crazy high IV, you can join theta gang sell GME puts (cash covered or spread) at strikes of $25p to $35p for April, netting you premium of around $7 to $11. This bakes in one Q4 ER which GME should do well in, and with IV at +400% and delta of under 0.02 and lower (heh), the odds are stacked in your favor to come out ahead of the play. If assigned, you'll be paying only $18 for GME for the 25p and $24 for the 35p. Another company that will likely be a decent hold if assigned: BB puts are also going for decent premium. Feb 19 10p is going for around $1.75 with a delta of 0.2, or you can go further out to March 10p which nets you about $2.5 with a delta of 0.2 as well.\n\n* **Noteworthy ERs:** With most of the big bois ER behind us (and overshadowed by meme stocks), earnings season continues next week with a few more market movers. On Feb 2nd, BABA, PFE, and UPS all reports before market opens. Later that afternoon, AMZN will report after market close. Further along the week, PYPL reports on Feb 3 after market close while PINS reports Feb 4 after market close. (PINS doesn't really move market but its noteworthy enough).\n\n* **Notable econ numbers** includes the usual boys with Monday PMI at 9:45 AM ET, ISM manufacturing index at 10 AM ET, jobless claims on Thursday at 8:30 AM and the big daddy employment situation (nonfarm payroll etc) on Friday at 8:30 AM ET. \n\n* The DOW closed down -2% or -622 pts, Nasdaq down -2% or -266 pts, SPX down -1.93% or -73 pts, and RUT close down -1.57% or -32 pts.\n\n(Yesterday's recap: none, but you can read [last's week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2a0e9/reeeeeeeeecap_of_todays_marketdriving_news_jan_21/) and bask in the past before GME and the Internet toppled the hedgies)",

        "selftext": "(*Editor's note: It's a wild day for the market and the country, and I will try to be as neutral as possible despite the fuckery afoot)*.\n\n* Dems clinched the GA Senate run-off election as Warnock defeats Loeffler while Ossoff defeats Perdue (the first millennial Senator). As the results became more clear last night, futures took a deep dive particularly for NQ, while conversely small caps enjoys a favorable bump. The market opened deeply red for QQQ as big tech retreated with renew fear on antitrust probes  and overall an unfriendly corporate environment as Democrats will control WH and both chambers of Congress. \n\n* By early morning, the sell-off quickly reversed and big tech recovered most of their red, with big tech such as AAPL going from -3% to just shy of yesterday's close during day's high. In contrast to big tech, clean tech and weed soared on Dems securing the Senate. ICLN was up almost 4% during pre-market and as high as 9% during intraday high and HASI was up 10% during intraday high. Weed stock such as TLRY was up as high as 21%, ACB as high as 11%+, and APHA as high as 14%.\n\n* Things quickly pulled back and tech started fading in earnest at 2:15 PM ET when protestors [cosplaying as revolutionaries](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106820104-1609961746992-gettyimages-1230453313-AFP_8YA6MW.jpg) stormed the capitol and Congress had to quickly pause their certifying of the Electoral College votes. Shit got real when a lady got shot as these protestors attempt to storm the [barricaded House chamber](https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1600/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F210106150417-03-house-chamber-0106.jpg) while Reps were still in the building.\n\n* The sell-off accelerated for AAPL, AMZN, FB, MSFT, and NFLX as most drilled back to opening lows by EOD. AAPL closed the day -3.37% to $126.60, AMZN -2.49% to $3,138, FB -2.83% to $263, MSFT -2.59% to $212, and NFLX -3.9% to $500.49. Thanks to overall negative sentiment of all things tech, QQQ closed the day red at -1.39% to $307 (retreating quite a bit more than IXIC given the weigh of big tech in QQQ).\n\n* Morning economic numbers had ADP reporting payrolls dropping to 123k in Dec, slightly below consensus of 130k. PMI was at 54.8 while consensus was 55.3, while factory order was up 1.0% MoM. Thankfully, none of these number fucking matters as the Dow, SPY, and IWM proceed to sky rocket with the market looking forward to stronger spending and stimulus from a Dem controlled govt.\n\n* Beyond weed, clean tech, and infrastructure - financial sector killed it today in particular mid-cap banks such as ZION (up 11.24%), CNC (up 9.81%), and KEY (up 9.73%). You'll find a similar story for large-cap bank stock with JPM closing up 4.70%, BAC up 6.25%, C up 5.75%, and WFC up 7.08%. It's a good thing I've already dumped my reopening [WFC leaps play](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kftjzt/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/ggarcbi/) of $25c and $30c which are now fucking ITM by $3~$8 and still have a year left to go on them. Nice.\n\n* In yet another confusing about-face and showing a real Karen spunk, the NYSE is *really* delisting the three Chinese telecoms this time. The real kicker though came in at 2:25 PM ET when news broke that US officials are considering *more* Chinese stock delisting, adding Chinese big tech Alibaba, Tencent, et al. to the potential list. A sea of red soon followed to compound the sell-off as BABA crater to the Earth's core and closed down -5.32%. Following suit, PDD closed down -5.58%, JD down -7.66%, and the same goes for Chinese EV NIO at -5% and XPEV at -2.62%. LI escapes semi-unscathed and closed the day up 2.48% thanks to a new BofA coverage with a Buy rating and a PT of $42.\n\n* In WSB meme stock land, GME was on track for a solid 8-9% day until the storming of the capitol occurred, PLTR's fade accelerated further while MT stays modestly flat, bouncing back from the overall market sell off. GME closed up 5.70% to $18.36, PLTR closed down -4.31% to $23.54, and MT closed up 0.32% to $24.70. ICLN, a new WSB favorite due to new balance of power in Congress might be added to future roundup if it continues to pump. Imagine that, a clean energy boomer ETF becoming a meme stock. The iShares fund managers are probably wondering why their alerts going tits up with social media mentions and sentiment brewing.\n\n* Random trade ideas (these are not financial advice and if it goes wrong that's your own gdamn fault):\n\n    1) FSLY leaps Jan 2022 90c or 100c+ for eventual TikTok climbing back fully onto the service as ByteDance pointedly makes a political jab at outgoing administration. Headwind on this retarded play: cloud/stay-at-home stock continues to take a beating as rona gets under control as vaccine roll out picks up. \n\n    2) Sell AAPL cash secured puts Jan 15 120p to 122p if the big tech fade continues rest of the week. These ~0.18 to 0.24 delta strikes are likely safe enough and if assigned, you'll have an upcoming ER on Jan 26 to sell IV pumped covered calls to get out of the trade intact. Feb 19 puts are likely okay to sell as well given you'll receive much more premium from the ~43 dte chains. Headwinds on this retarded play: its CSP and CC. As boomer as it gets. \n\n    3) BABA leaps and/or March debit call spread for another bounce in a wild trading week for BABA. March 230c/250c is probably a sufficient spread while baking in a bit of IV via ER which is on Feb 11. Jan 230c to 250c if you're not poor. Headwind on this retarded play: Jack Ma really is missing and the US govt really will delist a 600 bil market cap Chinese ADR, forcing out all major US institution holders. Yeah, right.\n\n* The DOW closed up 1.44% or 437 pts, Nasdaq down -0.61% or -78 pts, S&amp;P up 0.57% or 21 pts, and RUT closed up 3.98% (!!) or 78 pts. Stay in school kids and avoid storming federal buildings or Twitter will start banning your fucking account. (TWTR locks POTUS account for 12 hrs and is down -1.99% AH).\n\n(Yesterday's [recap](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kr7ze8/reeeeeeeeecap_of_todays_market_driving_news_jan_5/)).",

        "selftext": "So I've read quite a few good DD's on silver lately and I've been really into charts today so I decided to see if I could find any sort of patern or anything really. What I found is actually super interesting, to me anyways. But dont forget, past performance does not equal future performance and this is all just speculative, but then again banks and people do have patterns, so if it is as highly manipulated as they say it is, maybe this is something. Anyways heres my retard document I spent far too long on.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/gA6gbZP\n\nSo bassically we have a batman pattern in 2008 and were curently on the right ear of a batman patern right now. Whats interesting is the VW infinity squeeze happened in October 08, just to the right of batmans ear. We are currently in the middle of a GME infinity squeeze, and are currently, on batmans right ear. The difference is what side of batman the crashes are, in 2008 the crash is to the right of batman, in 2020 the crash is to the left of batman. So that kills the pattern right? Wrong, in 2008 The fed didnt start the quantiative easing until 3 months after lehman brothers went bankrupt and the worst that could happen, happenned. In 2020 the fed Started QE as soon as possible, thus the reversed sides of batman make complete sense.\n\nWith all this said, this could mean that SLV will finish it's batman ear and the gme squeeze will crash SLV and then a recovery to ATH, it could mean that because of the reversed crash patterns SLV will start climbing to ATH without finishing batmans ear, or, the most likely scenario, this means absolutely nothing and I just wasted a couple hours of my weekend.",

        "selftext": "In 2020 retail-investor representation in the stock market surged by 4.7% to a record 19.6%. Spurred by zero-commission trading and COVID tailwinds, this booming segment of stock market traders has reshaped market behavior. \n\nI've been scraping discussion on WallStreetBets for several months, and tracking how often different tickers are mentioned every day.\n\nThe graph below visualizes yesterday's discussion on the forum. Size represents the number of times a ticker has been mentioned, whereas color brightness represents the performance of the stock. GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) had the highest discussion count with 495 mentions and returned 10.89% for the day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[WSB Heat Map](https://preview.redd.it/48jg1izvjic61.png?width=1119&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=089b824acc9dcd7f89689c71d661f0d127d164ee)\n\nA quick look at the above graph shows that many of the companies listed have experienced parabolic stock growth and volatility over the last several months.\u00a0This begs the question: **Has WSB discussion been a leading indicator for stock performance?**\n\nTo test this question, I backtested a simple strategy that buys and holds the 5 stocks that were most discussed on WallStreetBets in the previous week. We ran this backtest using data from 2020.\n\nThe graph below shows the portfolio holdings by week (click for full-size image):\n\n[WSB Portfolio Holdings](https://preview.redd.it/smkp7dualic61.png?width=1119&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c95d1d4bbc1047a2c76b26fbfc3305143dc39d6d)\n\nTesla, Apple, AMD, Nio, and Microsoft were among the stocks that most frequently cracked the weekly top five most-mentioned tickers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Most frequently held stocks](https://preview.redd.it/87r1vy9bkic61.png?width=1119&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffe1c8a89f6f603dd000223a4a26ee69402002fa)\n\nOver the last year this simple strategy was up over 61%, with especially strong returns in the last quarter of 2020. The \"WallStreetBets Portfolio\" was more volatile than the S&amp;P 500, but outperformed even during the downturn at the start of the year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$WSB Performance](https://preview.redd.it/cc17jspglic61.png?width=1118&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df61ec8ce1fc245a93cdb5fced42271e54f20de3)\n\nTo take a look at the relationship between WallStreetBets discussion and market activity at a stock-level, I\u2019ve picked a couple stocks that were among the most popular on WSB in the last 120 days and examined them to determine if there is a correlation between WSB discussion and share price and volume.\n\n**Palantir Technologies Inc (NASDAQ: PLTR)**\n\nBig data analytics company, Palantir Technologies Inc, had its highly anticipated IPO on September 30, 2020 trading at $8.20. Shortly after, on October 14, the discussion volume of PLTR tripled to nine counts as well as achieving a 4.65% gain on the day. WSB count and share price activity continue to share a positive correlation coefficient of 0.592 as the stock reached a 52-week high of 33.05 on November 27, 2020. *\\[Note: A value of greater than 0.7 is considered a\u00a0strong correlation. Anything between 0.5 and 0.7 is a\u00a0moderate correlation, and anything less than\u00a00.4\u00a0is considered a weak or no\u00a0correlation.\\]*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Palantir Price vs. WSB](https://preview.redd.it/f8p41x1jkic61.png?width=1122&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2090f0fba5f9ee39cf7f3ed21932d31d6a0e1264)\n\nWSB counts and PLTR volume for the same dates recorded a correlation coefficient of 0.803. This could indicate a large amount of individual-investor interest driving the recent valuation of Palantir which features a low proportion of institutional ownership at 14.41% (3Q20), compared to the industry average.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Palantir Volume vs. WSB](https://preview.redd.it/4qiik9ekkic61.png?width=1354&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=074100895bb7e99da71462126ed7f972d5763948)\n\nPLTR received three downgrades from investment banks between October and December 2020 but added a price target increase to $30.00 (from $18.00) by Jeffries on January 11, 2021, well above its current price of $25.64. Risks still linger as 2Q20 to 3Q20 EBITDA losses increased by 83% to an $848.1m loss and, as of now, positive investor sentiment continues to support an uptrend.\n\n**GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME)**\n\nGameStop Corp. has experienced financial stress in recent years as the retail trends which had worked in its favor continue to decline globally. Total Liabilities climbed 12.18% to $2.26B from 2Q20 to 3Q20. Before May 5, 2020, WSB activity on GME had been dormant averaging 3.83 counts daily YTD.\n\nShortly following this, several threads on WSB began to speculate on a GME recovery due to increased gaming activity and a large existing short position of 57 million\u00a0shares at the time. WSB counts would be amplified after an investment from activist investor and founder of Chewy (NYSE: CHWY), Ryan Cohen.\n\nSince May 5, 2020, GME has rallied 755.33% and WSB discussion counts averaged 55.34 a day making a positive correlation coefficient at 0.688.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[GME Price vs. WSB](https://preview.redd.it/g8xj575nkic61.png?width=1356&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b458e40d9866fbecbedc224b5679ba885463f5d)\n\nThe WSB counts and stock volume also shared a correlation coefficient of 0.628. This was exemplified on November 30, 2020, when stock volume spiked by 31.3m and discussion counts followed suit at 227 for the day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[GME Volume vs. WSB](https://preview.redd.it/3d3xn8dokic61.png?width=1356&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af618e9f2ea29d71d69d86dc1884a44ec42bbf24)\n\nThe mainly optimistic speculation of a GME recovery in May on WSB contrasted with most major media outlets at the time, which appeared to focus on store closures due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The rally and enthusiasm behind GME since that time was in stark contrast to many other corporations, 630 of which filed for bankruptcy in 2020 marking a 10 year high.\n\n## Summary\n\nThere is no universal method of finding actionable insights when analyzing WSB, but discussion on the forum can serve as a useful estimation of retail interest. Companies that have had exponential growth with help from forums such as WSB are more likely to become transition to an organic growth phase with more institutional investors and less volume. Keeping an eye on rising companies on WSB could help identify an opportunity that many may have overlooked.",

        "selftext": " \n\nI will argue that GME is a value trap because it has no virtuous cycle to improve cash flow as its business model has been disrupted by the digital transformation of online video game sales and discounts. GME is set to default in the next 8 months without further cash infusion.\n\n# Business Model\n\nGME has margins has always been reselling popular titles. They buy low and sell high for popular titles. This has worked in the past but the tipping point had arrived in 2019 \\[1\\] putting severe pressure in the old business model.  \n\nIn the next generation console, online purchases will continue to be dominant. Moreover, when popular titles become less popular, they are heavily discounted online, incentivizing consumers to find deals online rather than holding on to physical media.\n\nThis compression in its high margin and sharp drop in foot traffic to drive sales will continue to impair cash flow in the future, leading to a solvency problem.\n\nLastly, the previous console generation had been saturated. It\u2019ll be unsustainable for GME to depend on customer selling and buying previous console titles.\n\n# Competitor Advantage\n\nThere has been excitement about Ryan Cohen trying to transform GME to an online business. But the competitor moats are too big to overcome. Microsoft and Sony own game studios and will continue to offer better deals on their online platform. There is no way for GME to compete with these monopolistic moats.\n\nIt is important to note that Blockbuster tried to shift online once it realize that Netflix had disrupted its business model. Blockbuster was unsuccessful because of Netflix\u2019s first move advantage, ability to raise large debt, and operate at massive losses at scale to undercut Blockbuster move online.\n\nA similar environment is facing GME as it plans its online pivot. Microsoft and Sony have massive cash reserves and at scale, and lower marginal operating costs compared to GME online business. Moreover, they control studios and can offer their exclusives first buying opportunities on their platforms before sales move to secondary platforms.\n\n# Value Trap\n\nGME has no virtuous cycle. Unlike Blue Apron that was able to improve cash flow because of the pandemic and people buying meal kits, or TSLA improving production and selling more green credits to improve production, GME has no virtuous cycle.\n\nMarket analysis indicates there is a structural shift to online buying and online platform to provide heavily discounted prices of popular titles once their popularity wanes.\n\nI will argue that GME business model is similar to Blockbuster after it was disrupted by Netflix. GME is in a death spiral, unable to compete against Microsoft or Sony.\n\n# Cash Flow Problems\n\nGME operating loss in October 2020 was 184M. They had 450M in cash \\[2\\] at the end of October. This implies a runway of 2-3 quarters in which they need to raise cash or face default.\n\n# Short Squeeze Mania Explained\n\nMuch excitement has been made about a possible short squeeze against Melvin Capital. People point to the recent 100% rise in GME to argue for a short squeeze. Much discussion has been made of it so I won\u2019t add to it, except to offer another explanation, focusing on MM and delta hedging.\n\nAs rumours about an infinite short squeeze on GME rose, a sharp rise in call option buying occurred. MM as part of their delta hedges would need to buy up shares. However encountering few shares to buy MM started buying ITM calls, and moving to OTM calls. This led to higher prices and MM needing to further buy shares and call options to delta hedge. So the steep rise in price wasn\u2019t from Melvin Capital but MM delta hedging. Furthermore, realizing the risky positions MM had taken as part of delta hedging (imperfect hedges) they decided to eliminate GME margins to slow down the gamma convexity\n\nTherefore it is the MM that had been buying shares and not Melvin Capital. This is supported by the early evidence that Shorts took on more shorts/puts as the price went up.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nGME is at risk of default in 6-8 months and a short squeeze may not come. ***In fact what may be happening is that retails have entered a massive value trap that will cause them to lose most of their investment should GME continue to face a cash crunch on weak sales/massive operating cash flow losses over the next 8 months without a huge cash injection***. Even then their business model is structurally problematic.\n\nAsk yourself, would you have invested in Blockbuster when you heard it was moving its business online?\n\n\\[1\\] https://screenrant.com/digital-game-sales-consoles-outnumber-physical-first-time/\n\n\\[2\\] https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/financials?p=GME\n\n\\[3\\] https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/cash-flow?p=GME",

        "selftext": "I'm in tech and I have good news if you like money. Shorting Intel is too obvious I don't know. why options are so cheap to buy. \n\n**Why Intel is doomed**\n\nIntel have missed their own deadlines for delivering newer manufacturing methods and their CPUs are falling behind AMD in terms of cost and performance for a while. That is not the news. The stock is already hit by AMD performance. Intel is doomed because our industry is moving to Arm. Arm processors are performing way better at a fraction of cost. See [this report](https://www.anandtech.com/show/15578/cloud-clash-amazon-graviton2-arm-against-intel-and-amd/9) if you're not convinced. What I'm seeing in the industry is that a lot of cloud computing customers are finding it super easy to switch to Arm. Developer computers are mostly Macs and the M1 Macs are just the tip of the iceberg on what's going to happen. Once developers can easily develop on Arm machines, they most likely will deploy their code to an Arm cloud server. Amazon's AWS Graviton is performing well enough to switch. \n\n**Microsoft will kill Intel** \n\nApple is doing their part with M1 and Amazon is balls deep with their Arm chips but what makes a huge difference is Microsoft's energy for fucking intel in the ass by making Windows Arm friendly and pulling a fast one on Intel by developing their own chips. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**\n\nAmazon, Apple and Microsoft are going to gang bang Intel's wife. Short this stock if you like free money",

        "selftext": "I don't know much, but I know tech and AMD has A LOT going for it right now.\n\n[*Obligatory do your own research and draw your own conclusions statement.*]\n\n**POSITIVES**\n\n- Both Sony and Microsoft are using custom AMD APUs in their latest consoles. (APU = CPU + GPU combined into one.) In case you've been living under a rock for the past 8 weeks, both the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X have been selling like hotcakes, with fresh inventory being depleted within minutes. \n\n- AMD has been the underdog vs Intel in the consumer desktop CPU space for as long as I can remember. But for the first time in 15 years, [AMD is winning in terms of market share](https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-overtakes-intel-in-desktop-cpu-market-share-for-the-first-time-in-15-years). Intel has been able to stay competitive with their latest generation of CPUs by offering significant discounts. Despite this, AMD's CPUs still remain in higher demand and sell out almost instantly (at MSRP). \n\n- AMD owns Radeon, which is their brand of Graphics Cards. These compete directly with Nvidia's RTX GPUs. Performance wise, they're up there with NVDA, but still lagging a bit in the ray tracing department which most will agree is the future. Key word being future, it's not a big deal *yet*. And thanks to the pandemic these too also sell out super quick. \n\n- AMD's next generation of mobile CPUs will be launching soon. Just like their desktop lineup, you can expect these to outperform their Intel counterparts as well. AMD's previous mobile generation of 4000 series chips crushed Intel - the biggest problem was availability. People wanted the AMD chips but for whatever reason, they were found mostly in the mid-range and lower end gaming laptops. I expect the availability issue to improve greatly this year. As we can see, certain manufacturer's like Asus are already featuring the AMD SKUs in their [top of the line gaming laptops](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-ROG-Strix-Scar-17-ditches-Comet-Lake-H-for-an-unlocked-Ryzen-9-5900HX-with-liquid-metal-and-RTX-3080-Mobile.514702.0.html). \n\n**RISK FACTORS**\n\n- While speaking purely from a monetary standpoint, overall I think the pandemic has been a net positive for tech companies like AMD. However, AMD's own fearless leader Lisa Su recently said: [\"...the COVID environment has increased shipping and freight costs, which are hard to avoid. As we get into a more normal environment, this should improve. This also matters for our planned graphics updates through the first half of the year, as we have a lot of product coming to market.\"](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16409/amd-ceo-dr-lisa-su-interview-on-2021-demand-supply-tariffs-xilinx-and-epyc)\n\n- Unable to keep up with demand: [AMD and NVIDIA confirm that GPU stock levels will remain non-existent for the foreseeable future](https://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-and-NVIDIA-confirm-that-GPU-stock-levels-will-remain-non-existent-for-the-foreseeable-future.514957.0.html).\n[Microsoft has asked AMD for help in combating Xbox Series X stock shortages](https://www.techradar.com/news/microsoft-has-asked-amd-for-help-in-combating-xbox-series-x-stock-shortages)\n\n- Apple has already started producing their own in house ARM processors for both their laptops and desktops. This doesn't really affect AMD (yet) because [Apple has been using Intel chips in their laptops and desktops for the past 15 years.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/10/why-apple-is-breaking-a-15-year-partnership-with-intel-on-its-macs-.html#:~:text=Menu-,Apple%20is%20breaking%20a%2015%2Dyear%20partnership%20with,on%20its%20Macs%20%E2%80%94%20here's%20why&amp;text=Apple's%20new%20laptops%20and%20desktop,can%20improve%20laptop%20battery%20life.) And despite being a massive company, Apple only makes up about [13% of the PC market share](https://www.statista.com/statistics/576473/united-states-quarterly-pc-shipment-shareapple/#:~:text=In%20the%20fourth%20quarter%20of,the%20fourth%20quarter%20of%202020.). AMD is still Apple's partner for discrete graphics, but that could change soon. This is definitely something you'll want to keep your eye on though because other titans like [Microsoft](https://www.reuters.com/article/microsoft-processors-int/microsoft-working-on-in-house-chips-for-its-servers-pcs-idUSKBN28S2Y1), [Google](https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2020/04/google-is-making-its-own-chips.html), and Amazon are all either working on, or producing their own in house chips. In my opinion, this is not nearly as bad as it sounds. Let's break it down by company.\n\n - [Microsoft currently uses Intel-based processors for the majority of its Azure cloud services, and most of the company\u2019s Surface lineup run on Intel chips, too.](https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189450/microsoft-arm-processors-chips-servers-surface-report#:~:text=Microsoft%20has%20worked%20with%20AMD,move%20away%20from%20just%20Intel.&amp;text=Microsoft%20co%2Dengineered%20an%20ARM,a%20couple%20of%20months%20ago.) Only some of Microsoft's laptops run on AMD hardware. \n\n - [Google is readying its own in-house processors for use in future Pixel devices, including both phones and eventually Chromebooks, too.](https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/14/google-said-to-be-preparing-its-own-chips-for-use-in-pixel-phones-and-chromebooks/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADHPvna5MKFbSAnwNIPsW4kMhD7zhe-7IJtk0AzQP1Rrer78Olm_S_019orsNcQA9Ezk_sCz0z8My1nHGdTap_0-SYZtHKs1U9v9ni-AGkuJzp3cOHYUDSEu7b90qMQIDsc-PC8tFFceJElhUcPhJ3ctKtatuQcLkrIF1VotSBz1#:~:text=The%20Axios%20report%20says%20that,machine%20learning%20and%20Google%20Assistant.) Again, because Google currently relies more on Intel CPUs this is not a big blow to AMD's bottom line. A quick check of BestBuy's inventory shows [47](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?_dyncharset=UTF-8&amp;id=pcat17071&amp;iht=y&amp;keys=keys&amp;ks=960&amp;list=n&amp;qp=parent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Celeron%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20i3%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20i5%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20i7%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20m3%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20m7%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Pentium&amp;sc=Global&amp;st=chromebook&amp;type=page&amp;usc=All%20Categories) Chromebooks with Intel SKUs and only [7 with AMD parts](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?_dyncharset=UTF-8&amp;id=pcat17071&amp;iht=y&amp;keys=keys&amp;ks=960&amp;list=n&amp;qp=parent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~AMD%20A4%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~AMD%20A6%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~AMD%20Ryzen%203&amp;sc=Global&amp;st=chromebook&amp;type=page&amp;usc=All%20Categories).\n - The chips that Amazon is producing are for their [cloud computing business](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/technology/amazon-apple-chips-intel-arm.html). These were also replaced by Intel.\n\nAMD has earnings coming up on the 26th which I think they're going to shatter. I probably would not recommend trying to play off of that though as ERs can be quite unpredictable, especially if the news is positive. Personally, I think AMD is going to \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 after ER, but I'm not betting on that. Which is why my current position (30% of my portfolio) is LEAPS: (x2) Jan 2022 90c.\n\nMy conservative 6 month PT for AMD is 110. Also open to hearing any other potential risks I may have overlooked. To be on the safe side I'm only including 6 rockets.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

During this time, GME bulls have been blessed with a sleuth of positive news. Before we start cookin let me get all the ingredients into the pot for you guys:\n\n# Tendie Recipe\n\n[Provided to you by GME shorts](https://preview.redd.it/sg8apugjsm961.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17bb70cb3f0a0c5c4bf91e8505e7655177ef15c5)\n\n# Ingredients\n\n1 **DIGITAL** revenue sharing agreement with GameStop  [(certified fresh by Domo Capital Management)](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/10/microsoft-will-give-gamestop-a-share-of-xboxs-digital-revenues/)\n\nXbox Game Pass subscriptions to taste [(15 million subs at $9.99 / month as of Sep 2020)](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21449219/xbox-game-pass-15-million-subscribers-microsoft-growth).\n\n1 acquisition of one of largest private game developers in the world for $7.5 billion dollars  [(responsible for elder scrolls, fallout, doom...)](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/09/21/welcoming-bethesda-to-the-xbox-family/)\n\n# Cooking Instructions\n\nYou have to have a chef's vision to see all this come together - the goal is to stew enough Game Pass subscriptions to make more and more tendies later on. How do we stew more Game pass subs?\n\n* Bullets below - More Game Pass subs = \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n   * Take the acquisition above and put some of their best games on Game Pass letting anyone on the subscription play it on Console or on PC.  Steam is on PC, and developers are starting to protest them.  Sony doesn't have a gaming subscription for cross PC-Console play. The digital future will have one master race there will be no console or PC - only game.\n   * Partner with the only worldwide gaming focused retailer so they can push your products over competitors.  Sony has a bigger market share globally right now, but with GameStop, Microsoft sees its partner in crime.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80 ](https://preview.redd.it/jxf6csxg1n961.jpg?width=506&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49e265425dd12fb93f6b55c0b39ea59b6cf7992f)\n\nAbove you see how much money Microsoft can make ANNUALLY if they get more subscriptions.  Now back to the whole point of this, we need the last ingredient, that spicy Microsoft deal with GameStop.\n\nGameStop get's a cut of Microsoft's digital Xbox revenue. Here is a quote from the article I linked above:\n\n*\"Loop Capital analyst Anthony Chukumba confirmed that same basic outline to Ars Technica based on his conversations with GameStop management. \"The way it's going to work is for every Microsoft Xbox console that GameStop sells going forward, GameStop will get some percentage of the revenue from every digital full game download, DLC, microtransaction, and any subscriptions as well.\"* \n\nHow much of a cut? No one really knows. After July I'll pay one of you paper hands to find out because you're most likely better at that then making this tendie recipe.  Let's speculate though assuming GameStop collects 3% of the revenues.\n\n50 million annual subscriptions = Additional $6 billion in ANNUAL revs for Microsoft\n\nLet's say that GameStop, because they're chummy with Microsoft, sell about 35% of ongoing XBOXs moving forward, allowing them to access the digital revenue share.\n\nThis works out to be additional $63 million dollars at almost 100% margins. And this is just from **subscriptions alone**.  How much are the rest of the DLC, microtransactions, and full digital game downloads worth for GameStop?  It's hard to know because Microsoft doesn't release detailed stats.  But let's take a look at their competitor so we can extrapolate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img urv8n5y77n961...*\n\nListen, I'm not going to to sit here and convert what a million million yen is.

        "selftext": "Mods please don't fuck me this took more effort than it should have.\n\n**TL;DR:  the GME shorts made one of the most braindead plays in market history,  and should have seen this coming from miles away. GameStop is a VALUE  play beyond the squeeze and is fairly valued at $200-500+ per share in a  stable market.**\n\n***Full  disclosure: I have an IQ equal to the number of employees at Citron  Research and a diet consisting of mostly Crayola crayons.***\n\nThis is for everyone who is catching up with the story of GameStop.\n\nGME  was removed from the S&amp;P 500 in April of 2016 in the midst of their  slumping performance in a gaming market shifting away from physical  media and retailers. At that time, GME market cap was just over $3b and  steadily shrinking.\n\nThe company\u2019s  bleed continued into late 2019, eventually bottoming out with an  8-figure market cap. Digital competition was rapidly increasing and  GameStop was not able to move quickly enough to adapt its business  model. They were getting bent by Amazon, bent by Microsoft, bent  by Sony. Gay bears were gleefully jerking each other off on the massive  piles of put and short tendies, but something was brewing.\n\nEven though the losses were piling on, GME was able to reserve cash *above*  its own market cap: around $500m in August 2019. This cash, and their  international brand name, were really the only two things the company  had going for it at the time.\n\nEnter Dr. Michael Burry, The Holy King Autismo. **Bull Bomb #1** \\- [Burry wrote a letter](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190819005633/en/)  to the GME Board recommending massive share repurchasing with the  company\u2019s existing cash. Burry\u2019s thesis was that repurchasing would  greatly increase EPS and position the company extremely well ahead of a  future sales boost from the 2020-2021 console cycle \u2013 consoles which  would indeed have disc drives. Buybacks would give GME more capital to  utilize, decrease their dividend burden, and allow a true transition.  Burry was in it to the hilt.\n\nGME  had already begun buying shares back, and they took Burry\u2019s advice to  buy back even more. In 2019, the company repurchased a total of $178.6m  in shares, representing about 34% of the company. Short interest was a  whopping 63% in mid-2019 with bears refusing to believe that any future  was possible for the brand. 9000-grit sandpaper couldn\u2019t make their  brains any smoother.\n\nEnter [u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/),  helicoptering his throbbing bull cock from the top of Mount Olympus.  Burry\u2019s letter generated some chatter on the sub but the sentiment  around GameStop remained mixed at best.  As far as I can remember DFV  was among the first on WSB to take a long position, and fuck he took a  big one: $53k on calls with various strikes. Almost every single comment  on his original posts was very gay and very bearish. [u/j1187064](https://www.reddit.com/u/j1187064/)  captured it best: \u201cOh, right, I forgot shit companies that are barely  clinging to life always come roaring back from terrible earnings.\u201d\n\nGameStop\u2019s  most critical moves came in 2020. The board got a big shake up in early  2020 with a focus on pivoting the business model to something slightly  less retarded. COVID fucked their retail sales squarely in the ass but  accelerated what was a much-needed expansion of their e-commerce arm\\*\\*.  Bull Bomb #2\\*\\* - digital sales jumped over 500% YoY, and this was **not** just for the new consoles. Still, short interest was increasing.\n\nEnter Ryan Cohen, one of the few men on earth who might win a dick measuring contest against King [u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/).  RC had been accumulating shares in multiple purchases throughout 2020,  eventually positioning himself atop the list of stakeholders. Rumors  were flying on the sub about a Cohen takeover of GME, and sure enough,  this materialized on January 11th, 2021\\*\\*. Bull Bomb #3, nuclear  edition\\*\\*. The board underwent another massive shakeup, now with Cohen,  Alan Attal, and Jim Grube from Chewy. This was the moment. Ryan Cohen,  founder of the now $43b e-commerce titan Chewy, with Board seats on  GameStop. GME was $20 per share at the time, with around 140% short  interest.\n\nWe\u2019ve all seen what has  happened in the 17 days since Chewy took the Board. WSB piled in and  DFV\u2019s balls experienced a condensed millennium of carbon pressurization  into the largest diamonds on planet earth. My only wish is that one day  he fucks my wife.\n\nSo why is  GameStop a value play, you ask? I don\u2019t like to estimate the nebulous  value of the gaming industry because it can be cut in so many different  ways, but it is a whole lot of fucking billions and the industry is  going to be booming for a long time to come. GME now has an incredible  fuckload of capital to work with, and the right people to deploy it.  This is what I think we will see in the near future:\n\n* **Subsidiary expansion**.  GameStop has been playing this game for a long time with varying  degrees of success (aka none), but I think they will continue this  strategy as they pivot their business\n   * **Game developers**  \u2013 there are innumerable great targets GME could acquire to build a  portfolio of games to offer in competition with larger players in the  space. See Microsoft\u2019s 343 Industries, Sony\u2019s 989 Studios, etc.\n   * **Streaming**  \u2013 there is room to grow in the streaming market, even with behemoths  like Twitch and YouTube out there. Streamers themselves aren\u2019t shy to  voice their complaints about the platforms that exist now, and I am  confident that streaming has a lot of room to develop\n* **Strategic partnerships**. The [Microsoft partnership](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-multi-year-strategic-partnership-microsoft)  is something I don\u2019t think has gotten enough attention yet. This is  industry demand for retail partnerships is there, and this deal shows  that it is there in a big way. GME is in a fantastic position to supply  infrastructure and stand on the consumer side on behalf of the largest  producers in the gaming industry. MSFT was the beginning of what I think  will be a massive expansion into these type of partnerships\n* **eCommerce**.  Cohen already proved to the market that Amazon is not the end-all for  web sales - see Chewy. Gaming has fucking yacht loads of product to move  \u2013 consoles, controllers, accessories, discs, hardware, branded merch,  you fucking name it. Check the credit card statement your wife\u2019s  boyfriend uses in your name if you\u2019re wondering how much people spend on  this shit. If you think Cohen isn\u2019t going to move them into dominance  on this you are dead wrong\n\nI  bet there is are a lot more potential moves to be made for GME here,  this is just what I am thinking we\u2019ll see in 2021. Let me know where you  guys think this rocket will take us.\n\nBuy high, sell never, fuck Citadel, fuck CNBC.",

        "selftext": "My initial post wasn't showing up on the page because I believe it had too many words. I wanted to write some points toward why GME is going to fly to the moon regardless of the short squeeze. If you're not a gamer then maybe this will provide some insight. \n\nGamestop has been moving away from physical sales in a big way and I believe there are a few things happening in the gaming industry that Ryan Cohen sees as priceless. \n\n**My overall point: Ryan Cohen isn't buying Gamestop to just drive E-Commerce. RC wants to turn Gamestop into the most beloved Gaming Culture company on the planet.** \n\nGaming is a huge industry. As a matter of fact, it's the largest entertainment industry in the world. 180 Billion tendies big and it's growing at such a fast rate it's expected to almost double by 2025. Gamestop is already positioned as one of the most recognizable gaming brands but they are known for not having quality customer service. RC has spoken a lot about how Customer Service and brand loyalty is his primary focus. If he can accomplish this, Gamestop will not have competition in the gaming industry in 5 years. I'm going to make the following points succinct.\n\n1) MSFT and GME have a deal for revenue share. It is reported that Gamestop also has something similar with Sony.\n\n2) Scalpers have ruined new console and PC parts sales for everyone. Inventory shortages are a real problem and Gamestops partnerships are a big part of solving this. here's why: I believe that Gamestop is organizing deals that not only revenue share, but also give them inventory priority. Want to buy the new Xbox? Go to Gamestop. Want to buy the new AMDs? Go to Gamestop.\n\n3) PC Build a Centers - This concept supports my statement in number 2. If Gamestop has a build a PC center arrangement, I would bet my money (and I quite literally have) that Gamestop is arranging inventory priority on the new chipsets and GPUs. It would not surprise me to see GME make deals with Intel and/or AMD to make this happen.\n\n4) Culture - ESports and Streaming are a huge hit. There are 140 Million unique visitors to Twitch on a monthly basis. They have arenas dedicated to ESports that get SOLD OUT. Imagine Gamestop hosting (successfully) local tournaments at their newly refreshed centers. Gamers will recognize Gamestop as an ally to the culture, not just a retailer. \n\n5) Subscriptions - Here's where the MSFT deal is bigger than I think it's being talked about. MSFT did something interesting with their next-gen consoles. They had a deal where you paid 24.99 a month for 2 years for the new console and got a Gamepass subscription included. \n\n6) Gamestop has talked about creating a digital trade-in platform Which would be huge in the gaming industry. I personally own at least 2K worth of digital games I haven't played in years and can't get rid of. \n\nCombine all of my points and I believe RC is looking to partner Gamestop's Power Up Rewards with MSFT Gamepass, along with some form of digital trade-in platform. Subscriptions are profitable.  Gamestop and MSFT partnership is fucking massive. Imagine Gamestop's ECommerce platform being the main medium that Microsoft uses for game purchases and trade-ins. PC game sales through MSFT store, Xbox store, all run on Gamestops platform. They Rev share all digital purchases and trade-ins and MSFT uses Gamestops physical locations to push their PC sales. \n\nSorry for the wall of text but this where my head at. I'm a fucking nerd I get it but Gamestop is known by every single gamer. If they can position themselves as part of the culture and not a blood-sucking retailer, it's game over for the competition. \n\nI believe Ryan Cohen can accomplish this.",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m so sick and tired of seeing the media thinking that individuals went into GameStop only because it was heavily shorted. Or because there was a coordinated circle jerk to fuck the shorts.\n\nPersonally, I got into GameStop because of big daddy Cohen and his proven track record. Do I even need to mention that legendary letter he sent to boomer ass Sherman and GME\u2019s Board of Directors!? And now he has going to be a member of the board with his former chewy executives! Should I mention that deal they have with Microsoft too? Or the muthafucking OMNICHANNEL capability!? Or the reliable revenue cycle when new consoles are released? \n\nBig daddy Cohen has a vision to transform GameStop into a staple in the e-gaming world, which is worth BILLIONS and growing everyday! As an avid gamer myself (for the horde bitches), investing in GameStop was a no brainer. \n\nYea, the squeeze is nice, but it was just a huge cherry on top of the Cohen sundae for me. And now Wall Street has pissed me (and THE WORLD) the fuck-off interfering with our tendies. \n\nI AM NOT SELLING. I LIKE THIS STOCK. \n\nPosition: Over 100 shares at $28 avg price.",

        "selftext": "# And the breakouts and \ud83d\ude80 of next week:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page, regardless of the subreddit, then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.\n\n**How is \"Hype\" calculated?**\n\nWell, this is a little tricky but it's based on the engagement that the post received in that sub-reddit relative to other posts in the same sub-reddit\n\n**How can I use this list?**\n\nThe best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending (like spotting those \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80).\n\nAs an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not, or to use some automated brokerages like [Quantbase](https://www.getquantbase.com) with algo-investor models based on these sentiment analyses. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits.

        "selftext": "Looks like after early rumors this week, the DA is officially out, so I thought I'd share some insights about Achronix's merger with $ACEV. It is currently trading \\~15% above NAV, and I consider it a strong buy right now. Please enjoy this quickly compiled post about ACEV/Achronix and why I think it's a great opportunity right now.\n\n[Achronix's position in the market serves as an attractive investment opportunity. Ridiculously strong financials at 76&amp;#37; gross margin.](https://preview.redd.it/ful5pypkr6a61.png?width=1277&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1512d4d40dceaaa53a38507139f21081cc10a8d3)\n\n[Achronix already has 55 patents and $400M+ in CUMULATIVE ORDERS lined up.](https://preview.redd.it/o8za6bfpr6a61.png?width=1279&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e27e7741689a78f0b331b5dde67d06aa8700d78)\n\n[Achronix's management team is filled with experienced veterans in the industry.](https://preview.redd.it/u9ukproxr6a61.png?width=1277&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77b6dc618db4f4f9c27a805dcd36741ae659acc1)\n\n[The company is poised to grow at \\~30&amp;#37; CAGR over the next 3 years.](https://preview.redd.it/ox3ms901s6a61.png?width=1278&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27d089e63c5c6361f507400d0d6b4eb95aed263d)\n\nFun facts:\n\n* It marks the **first time for a Korean PE firm** to set up a SPAC on the Nasdaq to acquire a US-based company. They don't plan to f\\*\\*\\* this up.\n* Founded in 2004, Achronix is one of the top five global fabless semiconductor companies and the **only independent supplier of high-performance field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)**. The profitable company is a key player in the global FPGA market alongside Intel Corp. and Xilinx.\n* The Silicon Valley-based FPGA maker's revenue in 2018 stood at around 67 billion won ($61.2 million), which surged to 115 billion won in 2020. This year, Achronix is expected to post 173 billion won in revenue. **Achronix will post \\~$160M in revenue for this year.**\n* Achronix's major clients include **Intel, Google, Microsoft and Samsung**. Achronix also licenses its intellectual property to **General Motors** for its advanced driver assistance system (ADAS). What a strong base of clients set-up for this company. Once the merger goes through, Achronix will gain more funding to scale their business.\n* Given its specialty in high volume and high speed data processing, **FPGAs are widely used for data centers, artificial intelligence, machine learning and 5G.** These industries are poised to grow significantly over the next few decades. Despite the buzzwords, they aren't buzzwords without validity. Achronix is positioned to serve these markets well.\n* The FPGA industry grabbed investors\u2019 attention when **Intel acquired programmable chip maker Altera in 2015 for approximately $16.7 billion**, followed by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) acquiring the leading FPGA maker Xilinx for $35 billion last year. As of today's writing, ACEV/Achronix's market cap sits at \\~$330M. In my opinion, it is severely undervalued right now.\n\nAlthough the initial rumors and Definitive Agreement came out this week across major publishers, the hype riding clean energy in SPACs overtook this announcement across the markets. **I expect this to be a strong long-term hold over the next decade. Currently, the SPAC trades at \\~15% above NAV.**\n\n[More details surrounding the merger.](https://preview.redd.it/waf6127ks6a61.png?width=985&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b48fb1bb2e5098cc9162e805e2071960388f8b6a)\n\nSource:\n\n(1) [https://www.achronix.com/sites/default/files/docs/Achronix\\_Ace\\_Merger\\_Presentation\\_VF.pdf](https://www.achronix.com/sites/default/files/docs/Achronix_Ace_Merger_Presentation_VF.pdf)\n\n(2) [https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202101080005?lang=us](https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202101080005?lang=us)\n\n(3) [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210107005892/en/Achronix-to-List-on-Nasdaq-Through-Merger-With-ACE-Convergence](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210107005892/en/Achronix-to-List-on-Nasdaq-Through-Merger-With-ACE-Convergence)\n\n(4) [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-06/achronix-is-said-in-talks-for-merger-with-blank-check-firm-ace](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-06/achronix-is-said-in-talks-for-merger-with-blank-check-firm-ace)",

        "selftext": "Hello brothers and sisters in GameStop. My sermon today is an examination of why some of our fellow autists have become millionaires while I continue to live in a cardboard box. \n\nI was an early-ish follower of the $GME faith, but when tribulations came my faith was shaken. I still went to church, but my heart wasn't in it like those we look up to. We must reflect on our failures to grow as followers in Cohen. \n\nThis testimony is long (sorry). I needed to force myself to actually examine things so I don't fuck up the next opportunity for tendies. This is my penance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**: Retard examining why I made small gains off $GME despite being in months ago. I keep track of all my trades. $GME has been a rollercoaster of emotions and opportunities in a very short time, so lots to learn. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Takeaways\n\n1. I never truly committed or believed in the position. It remained a small % of my portfolio and I was always hedging because being down even a couple % hurt, let alone -20% swings. To find 20X return you have to invest in companies that have significant uncertainty (and volatility). That  means persuasive arguments on both sides. If you lack conviction you won't be able to stay in.  \n2. Follow those charts and imagine you don't know where we end up. Put yourself in that moment. Holy fuck. **Am I buying the dip or catching a falling knife**? This has been bumpy and uncertain. We can all pretend this was a sure thing, it wasn't. It still isn't.\n3. We've all heard Fear and Greed rule the market. Its one thing to say that. Its another to feel it and observe it in yourself. My mood on $GME has flipped from \"This motherfucking boomer CEO is burning all my $\" to \"Fat FIRE, this year, motherfuckers\" 4 times in as many months. I felt intense emotions (still feeling them during the current run). W/o acclimating to balance that out I think its impossible to make good decisions. \n4. I'm very glad I kept detailed notes on what I was doing. Write down your thoughts and reason for taking a position. Revisit these. We're all retards. But that doesn't mean we can't learn our bad habits and improve. I'm stunned looking back by how often I was paralyzed and couldn't take action. \n5. None of this was obvious. There were strong cases that the business was undervalued. It was a good bet. But it was a bet. (Blasphemy you say? The true prophet, RoaringKitty said on yesterday's stream that as June turned into July and August and no PE firm or other investors stepped in he began to wonder if he was right). The business was bleeding cash, it just wasn't hemorrhaging like bears thought. The management is out of touch. COVID could have been worse. The broader market could have sold off, offsetting anything $GME did (and probably making sentiment even worse). \n6. I believe at $30-$40 the core business is reasonably priced and the value thesis is proved out. There are other stories (short squeeze and the business transformation) that remain. IMO these are far less certain, but in this market a good story might be worth $100. \n\n# Charts + comments\n\n[Entering via CCPs](https://preview.redd.it/kyuu2rh4rab61.png?width=2769&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ce9dc1dc310e756ff294b88061557fad2726a50)\n\nI hear about $GME. The business model of buy kids consoles for pennies on the dollar seems lucrative, video game sales in general are good, but COVID + things going digital are big question marks. The stock is up a lot from lows, but only liars buy at the low and sell at the high. Still seems reasonable, I sold weekly $10P (felt good about this).  Put premiums were good (3.6% for 3 days) and I figured I could get write for a couple weeks before being assigned. \n\nAlso, picked up some 1/15/21 $30C (retard FOMO, I even noted as much \"Getting in w/o doing full research based on Burry and Ryan Cohen + extremely high short interest. Very speculative at this point. Console refresh upcoming + GME while not vibrant is healthy balance sheet wise\").\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Assigned... Ok, time to wheel](https://preview.redd.it/8746byjkrab61.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c210980355934995c97ea8151066f07a9d449b48)\n\nAssigned on the first set of Puts. Fuck. Down 3-ish%. No worries, I'll collect more of that sweet premium w/ CCs at $10. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[MSFT News hits](https://preview.redd.it/8x1iv0kesab61.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=791ec4aec2a3929bc6622a3427539f11c6a0c42a)\n\nMSFT news released. No real details. Some people are mocking it saying it is just an agreement to buy MSFT products. Yeah, that's one way to read it. (We're 3 months past this date and still don't know the specifics...). Missed a 40% jump that settled around 20%. The wheel gave me a 7% return instead. $30C bounced up. Continue to do option writing strategies (purchasing for CCs or near the money Puts). Unsure whether I'm being an idiot and should just go long, but things feel speculative and I like the idea of generating returns now (even lower) to buffer against the downside. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3jtvwmdgtab61.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be9dea874271eef7c638f105e7d4d85603836579\n\nWe rocket again! Can't even remember their being news. Shorts are getting squeezed for sure. I'm missing out.  I buy 1000 shares at $15.06. I kind of feel retarded so I hedge it by selling CCs against half the position. Weekly at first, but then $16C 6 weeks out. \n\n$30C still have massive bid/ask spreads but have gone up nicely (150%)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d11ov8twuab61.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c822ab096d7312bde938adfac6de41ed6ffe2b16\n\nJesus fucking Christ. So glad I sold those longer dated CC, but still took a bath. Really wondering if I'm just an idiot buying in at the top. I also really start considering longer dated $10 Puts (20% for 2 months was available), but pussy out. \n\nI dump the $30C as well on the way down ($1k profit off a $1k position)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d1lkmd59vab61.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=123b123f3eecde3f236e7d29db7f716b1c65cc4a\n\nCohen sends a letter to the board. Market doesn't seem to care. The embarrassment of holding GameStop grows in me. I do a bit of buying to sell ATM CC's. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gwv65lwqvab61.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4bad068ef1a0d5780545dbc580737a45d774008e\n\nShit runs up again. Intense FOMO. Feeling like an idiot for not buying when things went back to \\~10. I'm doing the exact opposite of what you're supposed to do. A week ago I thought $GME was shit. Now I want to back up the truck... I held off buying at $13 (It'll pull back), $14, $15 (c'mon). I finally buy at 500 shares @ $16.01, 300 shares at $17.22, 700 more at $19.10. Watching this run up while holding a small position is ruining my Thanksgiving holiday...\n\nFeeling like a sucker I hedge w/ CC's. IV is thru the roof going into the Earnings call. I expect some detail on the MSFT deal. Hopefully the terms they got were good. Ideally they talk about similar deals w/ Sony and Nintendo (They got Reggie on the board, that's got to be a layup, right?). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Sherman gives a terrible CC](https://preview.redd.it/o8xq3fmiwab61.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d93203eea9a8e1a1ed17f6087cffaa7f22e3dd9)\n\nJesus. The numbers weren't that bad, but it'd be hard to shit the bed more if he tried. \n\n\\- No earnings guidance\n\n\\- No partnership deal details\n\n\\- $100M in possible share dilution via a Shelf offering. \n\n\\- No discussion of Cohen or other large holders who have presented suggestions for a turnaround (but we got \"Omnichannel\" boys!)\n\nI go from feeling like a moron for not having more to feeling dumb for holding any of this POS. How is this stock going to go up when the management has its head up its ass? I'm fucked. Holiday #s are the next big news item and these idiots will downplay them. Fuck. FUCK!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Cohen ups to 13.1&amp;#37;](https://preview.redd.it/ubwu5lkbyab61.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffb32464ea1644732caba3752a03921d2cc1a55a)\n\nThere was serious talk of Cohen walking away. He had a low enough cost basis to make a good profit.  He re-affirms and ups his share. \ud83d\ude80 back on the menu. Why don't I have more of this? I missed another golden opportunity...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Random drop](https://preview.redd.it/u398ihwbzab61.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce4aa76f4c7b0fb3dd3cd19cb6b7a14fb81f8de5)\n\nI sold some CCPs near the top, pretty far out of the money. Would have been assigned at $18. Instead, I close the position for a small profit on the premium, don't want to up my $GME holdings. Already feels like too much exposure. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Yesterday](https://preview.redd.it/4x2txed31bb61.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d3202709646cdffdf214d4747df21903d128db7)\n\nCohen and the board were added Monday. Mild move up (10%). TBH I'd barely processed that news when the 60%+ day occurred. \n\nI had 1500 shares w/ only 3 CC's written against them. Proceeded to sell CC's (8 contracts) at $25, $26, $29. I was expecting the move to stop at 15-30%. Obviously misjudged that but that's been my experience. I also really wanted to do the smart thing for once and take profits (relax, not selling shares, just writing contracts) on the upswing vs my normal retarded MO of buying high hoping to sell higher. \n\nWas eye-balling selling the $40C when it hit 600IV ($6 premium for 3 days...), but by that point I was so gunshy (every call I'd written to that point was blown by) and convinced this was going to infinity. I'm resisting the urge to buy, but its hard. Instead I sold some CCP's at $15k worth of $25 (4% return over 3 days). Those 1/15/21 $30C, even w/ massive theta decay, are selling for 3X what I got. \n\nAs confident as the market re-affirming my beliefs makes me $GME still isn't turning a profit yet. Details around the turnaround are scarce. I'll ride it up since my cost-basis is much lower, but I think I missed the opportunity for obscene gains.",

        "selftext": "Hi there, r/stocks!  \n\n\nA bit of a background: I'm a 27 year old, with a job that provides for my daily income. I recently \"woke up\" to realize that I need to invest the money that's just sitting idle in my bank account, especially since I do not need that much cash right now. So, I decided to invest some of my existing savings in the stock market for the **long term** (buy-and-hold, I'm in no hurry to make gains). This was my **first ever investment**, so I am quite the newbie. I'm hoping to invest a total of around $40,000-$50,000 this year.\n\nNow, a few days ago, I bought stocks worth a total of around **$25,000**, largely in ETFs, **all together**. These are the investments:\n\n1. MSFT: $4k (at around $214)\n2. VGT: $4k (at around $353)\n3. QQQ: $4k (at around $314)\n4. ARKK: $3k (at around $139)\n5. ARKF: $3k (at around $51)\n6. PBW: $3k (at around $123)\n7. ARKG: $2k (at around $106)\n8. ICLN: $2k (at around $126)\n\nI'm now having some second thoughts, and would be grateful to have some of your more qualified opinions on the same:\n\n* Did I make a mistake by investing $25k altogether? I didn't know about DCA (dollar cost averaging) until after I finished buying (sounds stupid, and it is). The reason I'm nervous is because there are opinions that suggest the market is at an all-time high &amp; will pullback massively soon. OTOH, my portfolio looks \"balanced\" &amp; low-risk, but again, I'm not sure. To reiterate, I don't need the $25k cash &amp; am perfectly okay with investing it altogether, *if* the investments make sense.\n* If this is a mistake, how can I fix it? Should I just sell off half my holdings, evenly across the board, and then DCA for the rest of the year?\n* Or, should I keep the safer bets (MSFT, QQQ, VGT) and sell off just the riskier ones (ARK, PBW, ICLN)?\n* Alternatively, should I just hold on, given that I'm here for the long-term?\n\nThank you for reading, and I look forward to learning from you awesome people!",

Before I get started, I just wanted to bring to light a type of bias that may show prevalence. If you have heard of this company before and are already thinking of investing, read the definition of confirmation bias: \u201ctendency to interpret new evidence as confirmation of one's existing beliefs or theories.\u201d Read through the next paragraphs with a neutral mind, free from bias, I present a devil\u2019s advocate argument at the end to subside the rest of the information. Confirmation bias is definitely prevalent on any subreddit, so be careful! \n\n**Who is Converge Technology Solutions?** \n\nBest represented by their own description: \n\nConverge Technology Solutions Corp. is a North American Hybrid IT Solution Provider focused on delivering industry leading solutions and services. Converge\u2019s regional sales and services organizations deliver advanced analytics, cloud, cybersecurity, and managed services offerings to clients across various industries.\n\nConverge supports these solutions with talent expertise and digital infrastructure offerings across all major IT vendors in the marketplace. This multi-faceted approach enables Converge to address the unique business and technology requirements for all clients in the public and private sectors. \n\nThe company has 71, not to be confused later with 17, Strategic Alliances with software, hardware and general programs that are offered by companies around the globe. Some include: Gold Microsoft Partner, Titanium Dell Technologies Partner, and Advanced Amazon Web Services Partner. \n\n**Traded on:** \n\n1. TSX Venture Exchange: CTS.V\n2. OTCQX (Highest OTC exchange): CTSDF\n3. Frankfurt Stock Exchange: 0ZB \n\n**Family of Converge Technology Solutions** \n\nSince October 2019, CTS has acquired 17 companies. This is huge, CTS\u2019s operation seems to be acquiring different IT companies focusing in on Cloud, Cybersecurity, Digital Infrastructure, etc. and forming the companies into an arm of CTS for offering leading-tech solutions in the software industry: \n\n1. **Corus360** \u2013 Cloud, Dad Center, Talent Solutions \n2. **Norther** **Micro** \u2013 AI &amp; Advanced Analytics, Cybersecurity, Cloud &amp; Edge computing \n3. **Becker**\\-**Carroll** \u2013 Strategy &amp; Planning, Design \n4. **KeyInfo** \u2013 Computing, Storage &amp; Networking solutions \n5. **BlueChipTek** \u2013 Hybrid Cloud, Global Logistics, Full Rack Integration \n6. **Light** **House** **Computer** **Services** \u2013 Analytics, Hybrid Cloud, Infrastructure, Security \n7. **SIS** \u2013 Managed Cloud, IaaS, Data Protection \n8. **NSI** \u2013 Data Center, Cloud Security, Enterprise Mobility Solutions \n9. **EssexTec** \u2013 Cloud, Cognitive, Cyber Security \n10. **DataTrend** \u2013 Data Center, Cloud \n11. **VSS** \u2013 Managed Services, Portfolio Management &amp; Services \n12. **PCD** \u2013 Virtualization &amp; Cloud, BC/DR, Enterprise Architecture \n13. **Unique** **Digital** \u2013 Infrastructure Implementation &amp; Support \n14. **Workgroup** **Connections** \u2013 Cloud, Software Development, Licensing, Consulting \n15. **Vivvo** \u2013 Identity Management, Vivvo Trust Platform \n16. **Vicom** \u2013 Full-service Multi-cloud infrastructure \n17. **CarpeDatum** \u2013 Analytics, AI, Performance Management \n\n**Public Recurring Revenues for each Subsidiary;** \n\nFound only 6 of their 17 acquisitions:\n\n1. **EssexTec** \u2013 $52 Million \n2. **VSS** \u2013 $80 million (USD)\n3. **Unique** **Digital** \u2013 $70 million \n4. **Workgroup** **Connections** \u2013 $14.7 Million \n5. **Vivvo** \u2013 $1.85 Million \n6. **CarpeDatum** \u2013 $6.7 Million \n\nThese acquisitions of substantial revenues will add to the portfolio of CTS; obviously, there are other financial aspects to consider such as EBITDA, Goodwill (synergy, etc.) of each transaction to see if it adds benefits. Other considerations, qualitatively, would be to look at each of the company\u2019s specialty and understand that each one of these 17 acquisitions brings in management experience, growth to the global network, and brand extension. Each one of these acquisitions will feature \u201cA Converge Company\u201d underneath their logo to show their presence within the broader network! \n\nMore info on what each of these companies do can be found here: https://convergetp.com/portfolio-of-companies/ \n\n**Current Financials:**\n\nAll data is from their most recent filing of 9-months ended September 30, 2020:  \n\n1. **Revenue:**\n   1. 39% Increase to $659,242,000 from $473,090,000 (Dec31,2019).\n      1.

This improves the case for work-from-home (WFH) becoming more prevalent. This is one of the key growth drivers for Converge Technology Solutions and will continue to be as large companies around the globe have already mentioned to their employees that in the future WFH will be more flexible and even in some cases companies will have closed their offices as they see their efficiency can be matched by working remotely. The recent acquisitions, and the planned acquisitions ahead will drive revenues and bring qualitative benefits for years to come. \n\n**TSX Up-listing** \n\nAs I previously mentioned, Converge Technology Solutions is currently traded on the TSX Venture Exchange which in basic terms is the junior exchange to the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). \n\nIn a news release on November 19th, 2020 the company stated that it has received conditional approval from the TSX to graduate from the TSXV to list the company\u2019s common shares on the TSX. The final approval of the TSX listing is subject to Converge Fulfilling certain standard and customary conditions required by the TSX on or before February 17th 2021. CTS is very confident it will satisfy all the conditions and further communicate to investors about the process. \n\nThis is a large opportunity to take advantage of as institutional investors may start to get on-board with the up-listing as 0.74% of all outstanding shares are being held by institutions. Similarly, insiders hold a relatively high % of outstanding shares at 15.47%. \n\nSpeculation: With the up-listing to the TSX, this may show further opportunity to cross-list their security on any US-exchanges such as NASDAQ, NYSE, etc. \n\n**Devil\u2019s Advocate** \n\nIn order to subside all the positive information above, I must bring to light something that may concern others moving forward. This topic has to do with **Dilution** and the increasing number of common shares over the past year or so. Public offerings (closing date) include: \n\n1. **February 20, 2020** \u2013 Approx. 6,000,000 shares. \n2. **July 31, 2020** \u2013 Approx. 10,800,000 shares. \n   1. Proceeds: $17.5 million. \n3. **September 30, 2020** \u2013 Approx. 14,650,000 shares. \n   1. Proceeds: $30.0 million. \n4. **January 15, 2020** \u2013 Approx. 17,825,000 shares. \n   1. Proceeds: $86 million. \n\nIn a previous section above, I highlighted the increase in common shares within the Financials section. The company continues to publicly offer shares in order to raise capital to fund its acquisitions. This allows the company to gain cash in order to fulfill its obligations; however, investors may be torn whether to invest or not because when they publicly offer their shares to underwriters, they list a price well below the current market price and this causes people to panic or even scare potential investors away. The increase in the common shares dilutes each individual share so it decreases in value proportionately to how many shares were offered. \n\n**Summary** \n\nAll in all, with the presented information above, Converge Technology Solutions as a company is a huge buying opportunity for investors to take advantage of, the share price has been on an upward trajectory for the past year and I believe this will continue with the future catalysts of TSX up-listing and future acquisitions. Dilution remains present in the eyes of investors but it\u2019s definitely a growing pain; the funds are actively being used to grow the business and the stock price has never been set back with the constant public offerings. Converge\u2019s growing family network of 17 companies will continue to grow in the near and far future. \n\n**Disclosure**\n\nTo be fully transparent, I am an active investor in CTS.V on the TSXV. I will not disclose how many shares or the share price in which I acquired my shares but know that I have been adding to my position on dips for the past month, the dips that happened this week I took advantage of and added to my positions confidently. \n\nThanks for reading! I really enjoy understanding companies in-depth and being passionate about what I am invested in so know that this post was created out of sheer passion and not for any other gains!

        "selftext": "To understand how stocks move, first, you gotta understand the interaction between buyers and sellers. Basically, it's Econ-101 supply and demand. Too much demand? Buyers will have to raise their prices so that sellers sell.\n\nSecond, the types of market participants. Active and passive participants.\n\nPassive participants are like, buy buy sell buy sell buy sell buy buy buy sell buy sell sell buy. This is almost completely automated and determined by the weighting of the stock versus the index or the methodology that it is following.\n\nThe bots of VOO, for example, doesn't give a damn if an accounting scandal has happened or if a new breakthrough has been reached. Every day, it will buy and sell stocks indiscriminately, following the algos.\n\nAnd increasingly, newer assets under management are coming mostly under those passive investment vehicles such as passive ETFs, passive mutual funds etc leading to them having a larger and larger share of the market. (I am coming to active participants later)\n\nThirdly, you gotta understand hedging. Which is basically an investment position to offset losses. Example, you sell a naked call. You see the stock moving closer to the strike price. You immediately buy shares to ensure that you don't take a loss.\n\n# Ok, now why do individual stocks move?\n\nThey move based on events (plain old news, market-related movements etc). Now, let's go back to active participants such as retail investors, hedge funds, fund managers etc.\n\nSuppose, there's a quarterly earnings report coming out for ASML. Almost all active participants have somehow figured from various news reports that the earnings report will be good because of the huge demand for ASML's product.\n\nAs a result, an active fund manager takes a big position on that stock. The stock moves a bit. Hedge funds and other firms also take their positions.\n\nA retard post about the company's upcoming good earnings on the internet and all early retard investors quickly get in.\n\nThe stock moves up. In the meantime, the passive funds are adjusting their position in the stock, realtime. If it's going up. They are buying more to adjust their position.\n\nNow, don't forget. Those passive ETFs or funds have other semiconductor stocks in their ETFs and shits. Which means, even if only ASMLs quarterly earnings were supposed to be good, other stocks of the same sector will benefit. As there are tons of both active and passive algos that don't trade individual stocks but ETFs and similar stuff due to liquidity reasons.\n\nThis gets even better. Suppose, lots of retail investors are also buying call options of this stock. If the underlying continues to go up, the delta could keep on rising. Suppose it went from 5% to 10% to 20%. This would force the option sellers to keep on buying more and more shares and could lead to gamma explosion where the market makers create a violent feedback loop due to hedging.\n\nIt gets more fun than that. Remember the various HFT firms and scalper bots? Well, they know it all too well that some firms are busy at hedging frenzy. They also join in on the feeding frenzy that is this stock.\n\nAfter said earnings release(or most likely, just before it), most of the active participants like retail traders and hedge funds may well start taking profits. And the stock generally runs up more than the expected in the first place.\n\nThis leads to the violent unwinding of the positions that we generally see after the earnings release. Because everything happens in the exact reverse order I just described here. That's why it's a terrible gamble to buy options in hope of a good earnings release or similar news.\n\nIt feels euphoric if you are on the right side of the tide and equally depressing if you are on the wrong side of the tide.\n\nThe same thing can happen in the opposite direction if a piece of bad news is expected or happens.\n\nHere, earnings release is just one of the events that I described. It could be any event like index inclusion, regulatory shifts, stock splits, analyst upgrade-downgrades, some fund manager or hedge funds buying the stock etc.\n\nAlso, don't forget that all this is also affecting other stocks in the same sector/region etc due to them being connected through passive investments and active participants exploiting the passive participants.\n\nA very recent example of this happening would be the stock PLTR. Remember, they signed a contract with FDA for $44M but the stock moved almost $10B or more(I haven't calculated) or about 20%. Two weeks ago maybe, Citron declared short attack and a violent unwinding of positions happened and the stock went down about 15-20% after climbing 10-12% that day. Or the day before that when it climbed 20%+.\n\nNow I have sold calls on PLTR (yeah, I like it that your 12/04, 12/11, 12/18 expired or will expire worthless).\n\n**This is not how all stocks move.**\n\nBut a large portion of the stocks that are mentioned here in the sub move this way. This is why it sometimes feels like to you folks as KINDA pump and dump. But whether you retards accept it or not I know you guys are the cream of the crop. While most of you act as if you know nothing, I know very well most of you probably make money.\n\nYou guys are like people who watch tech reviews to buy a smartphone.\n\nOk, I completely went out of topic. Sorry.\n\n**This is not how all stocks move.**\n\nSome boomer stocks like MMM, JBT etc may have low retail interest. In those cases, the stocks are almost absolutely up to the mercy of other active participants, who or which may as well not care that much leaving those stocks to the hands of the algos of passive participants.\n\nBut in those whole processes, there's almost no price discovery that's actually working. Passive algos are buying and selling (but mostly creating buying pressure) completely arbitrarily, HFT bots buying and selling because, reasons.\n\nThe participants who are using traditional valuation metrics, analyzing the good and bad of stocks are getting outnumbered by all the other participants and generally speaking, the volume of their trades are also declining in the overall market. Think of big participants like Berkshire(which is undoubtedly the most powerful active participant in the market), pension funds, sovereign funds etc, they barely buy or sell any stocks they have if they have entered on the right price.\n\nSure, I am kinda underselling the influence of big institutional investors, but it is not completely without any merit.\n\n**So you are saying there's no price discovery in the various stocks?**\n\nAbsolutely not. Even in the greatly flawed system I described being used by most market participants there's plenty of it happening by newsflashes, sell-side analyst recommendations, retail fomoers etc.\n\nOnly the stocks that have heavy institutional ownerships, with a healthy retail interest seems to me to be less volatile(this is my intuition speaking really, so this statement is probably false in the first place) such as MSFT etc and they probably have better price discovery.\n\n**What about those stocks doubling the day they IPO?**\n\nThe reason behind that is very simple. Tons of retail investors place Market Orders. This means they are ready to pay whatever the price this thing will go for. In those scenarios, investment banks can hardly control the price of the stock as there's just too much demand to satisfy. In short, it's a feeding frenzy. And this is one of the things that's primarily driven by retail interest.\n\n**What about those SPACs and low-float stocks?**\n\nWell, this again needs no explaining. Too low float, too much interest. Various whales also know this and use this for their benefit. After the merger is complete(or slightly before it) retail investors and whales leave for the next thing in the line. So the stock tanks and the stock price never recovers.\n\nIf the company that's being pumped is actually any good, the stock would likely later get the attention it deserves after the sell-off.\n\nI hope all those points are good enough to explain most of the funky behaviour an individual stock would make. I know my explanations are not exhaustive and there are many angles I haven't covered, but it is what it is.\n\nNow, to the MORE IMPORTANT STUFF. Individual stocks also move due to numerous macro reasons. When the entire market is in a euphoric phase, you can throw a dart and that stock would move up. The opposite and the stock would go down.\n\n# Why and how does the market move?\n\nLiquidity. This is probably the most important thing that drives the market as a whole.\n\nExcess liquidity that's circling around will inevitably try to enter into the economy in one way or another. Either through purchasing more assets or any other way.\n\nNow, we all know it pretty well that this trend is being exaggerated by the low-interest-rate environment that's present in the current developed markets. People are being forced to participate in the market in the hunt for return.\n\nAlso, almost every investor from every country seems to be more interested to participate in the US stock market, even more than their home markets. And the recent trend of commission-free brokerage services and easy flow of capital has helped to provide even more participation in the stock market than usual.\n\nOptions trading is also at historic highs and probably most of you buy call options and put options is probably mostly bought by institutional investors(like it always were). As a whole, this frenzy can move the market very quickly.\n\nRemember, SoftBank bought billions in options on very concentrated tech names? That along with retail call options purchasing mania lead the market to a euphoric state. The S&amp;P 500 has become so heavily influenced by those tech names that if they move, the entire market moves. If they fall, the entire market falls.\n\nBut we haven't probably addressed a big elephant in the room. Volatility suppression.\n\nFutures traders, algos, our central bank etc all are participating in the dangerous game of volatility suppression. \n\nThis all can unwind though. And it can unwind fairly quickly.\n\nIf we take the case of February or March. If you remember, Mr Ackman was screaming fire, fire, fire(he have had his intentions) but the market was barely paying attention.\n\nBut with the lockdowns and everything, suddenly everyone seems to have gotten caught with their pants down.\n\nAnd you know how quick all the things were. Active investors, retail investors everyone suddenly flocked for put options, VIX etc. A Minsky moment has suddenly come.\n\nMargin calls, longs are burnt left and right, market makers have completely turned their positions etc, you know the usual deal but exactly in the opposite direction.\n\nSuddenly gold, treasuries, cryptos etc whatever are being sold to cover their positions. Institutional investors are suddenly visited by their risk managements and they suddenly become net sellers.\n\nPassive investments vehicles also sell stocks that are being kicked heavily.\n\nLiterally, everyone's a seller. No one wants to buy. And the situation doesn't change until the Fed comes in and says, \"Brrrr\".\n\nLiquidity suddenly becomes available in the debt market. Retail investors jump. Buy the dip, they said. Money keeps flowing in from everywhere.\n\nThere are many other things that I probably needed to say to complete the story. But it is what it is.\n\nAlso, interest rate trumps over everything. Every valuation metrics, pricing schemes are dependent on it. So that's super important.\n\nLet's say suddenly interest rates rise the market will immediately collapse along with your meme stock. Because of two main reasons. Every company is loaded with debt and the risk free return has just increased resulting in more money chasing treasury bonds and other instruments.\n\n# These pieces of information any useful?\n\nYes and no. As they say, hindsight is always 20/20.\n\nLet me tell you my short story navigating the market this year.\n\nFebruary. News of the virus and everything. I see VIX, S&amp;P, bond market, foreign markets etc and I keep sucking my thumb thinking nothing's going to happen. Being burnt by two trades and market starting to freefall almost. I realize my mistake and change my strategy.\n\nFed says, \"Brrr\". I fail to change my strategy. Something even worse could be coming. Lol. After almost a week passing I realise my f\\*\\*\\*ing mistake. Again. At least I can say it's not just me.\n\nThe information is almost always there. Problem is we(not everyone of course, some of you are much more flexible) fail to act upon it. \n\nOk, one more story about an individual stock.\n\nRemember AAPL's third-quarter earnings result? I sold calls before earnings thinking the stock will go down after earnings report.\n\nThere was overwhelming evidence that this is not going to be true. And I read almost all of it (WFH and everything). Yet my monkey brain somehow decided to trust the analyst estimates and the overall news cycle surrounding the economy.\n\nAAPL then reported a literal blow away quarterly earnings report.\n\nFor me 2020 was a year of reckoning and I learned to remove my directional assumption from the market and to just go with the flow. But I am pretty sure it wouldn't matter, cause when it's time, I just wouldn't remember.\n\nI posted this one before but it got removed by votebots.",

        "selftext": "**What you need to know:**\n\n*Processing img dyy8vg81gpc61...*\n\nPLTR is experiencing a heavy strong trend with a bull and flag. It's broken support this morning and is back up. PLTR has had positive momentum, tons of new contracts and lots of volume. It's been in this pennant and is due for a breakout. PLTR's Demo day is the 26th of Jan and earnings is Feb 11. Demo day is gonna showcase new Palantir products and outline what PLTR has in store for 2021. \n\n**A case for longs:**\n\nPalantir aims to put together software that compiles data that provides insights into potential problems, solutions to these problems, and help solve complex, real-world problems. This data and analytics is fully interactive, and machine-assisted. So far, Gotham and Foundry are Palantir's products. Gotham is the military/government grade software and Foundry is the commercial equivalent. Apollo is a program that essentially removes the need for support teams when Gotham and Foundry need an update. Apollo gives Foundry and Gotham users the luxury of updating their software like it's an IOS update. These three products are the fundamentals of PLTR\n\nPalantir's goal in the commercial and govt space is to grow in scope and scale. This prepares them for a horizontal integration. They are trying to build a wide moat for themselves in order to secure an opportunity for vertical integration as well. By preparing themselves for both vertical and horizontal integration, they are going down a road not dissimilar to that of Standard Oil. There is not a doubt in my mind that this company is run by people who know what they're doing. \n\nPLTR is now the biggest company involved in government data. The US cannot afford to have PLTR go under, and thus it will never go away- the only way is up. The real question is, how fast is it going up?\n\n\"Looking ahead, Palantir is poised to become the default central operating system for data across the U.S. government and its allies. The company also aspires to be the central operating system for data at large businesses and even entire industries. To appreciate Palantir's ambition with regard to B2B big data, it may be helpful to recall how much economic benefit has been captured by Microsoft (MSFT) after Windows OS took the lead over MacOS of Apple (AAPL) in the PC era, and by Google and Apple in the consumer mobile phone age with their respective Android and iOS operating systems.\"\n\nCompetitors in this niche tech field are quickly swatted away. BAH and ACN lack the technical power and can't compete with PLTR pricing. Even defense contractors such as RTX, BAH, SAIC, and BAESF cannot compete with the costs and user-responsiveness of PLTR. You might ask why a big shot like google isn't stepping in to work with the government, to which I would chuckle and remind you that google stated they think the pentagon is \"unethical\" and prefer to work with the Chinese government on Project Dragonfly ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly\\_(search\\_engine)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly_(search_engine))). \n\nI'll go ahead and rattle off some quick deductions of mine. They have an aggressive merger and acquisition campaign. To grow into adjacent verticals, they absorb companies that are already there, quickening the speed they grow at. They are Capital-light and operationally efficient. Their ROI is very high and they can sell their product with existing hardware for as long as they are the best program to use. Meaning their software needs to be installed once but can be sold as many times as they like, as long as they keep their shit together. They are seriously dominating domestically in their niche. Their wide moat due to the M&amp;A campaign and good management for vertical + horizontal growth gives them a monopolistic outlook. They are in the captains chair. \n\n**Forward thinking**\n\nPLTR's last Q described sales growth of 46% in international sales. They want to move into Canada, Australia, UK, France and other allies of the U.S. They will very likely establish themselves there as well. They have a Foundry Joint Venture contract in Japan with Sampo Holdings for the wellbeing of the Japanese people. It was $500M. They are likely looking for a contract with Japan's government as well. \n\nMy short-term PT for PLTR is $34, passing ATH. This pennant is a strong trend and it is gonna break out hard. All signs point towards a bullish breakout so I'm loaded up on calls, overexposing myself three times with what I'm usually comfortable with exposing myself to. \n\nLong term, I can imagine PLTR breaking $100 within 2 years. With a growing need of govt software and national security, *PLTR's value can only go up*\n\n**TLDR: PLTR $34 by early Feb.**",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 1st, 2021.\n\n# **Wall Street braces for bumpy trading in the week ahead as the GameStop short squeeze unfolds - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/wall-street-braces-for-bumpy-trading-in-the-week-ahead-as-the-gamestop-short-squeeze-unfolds.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Earnings news from Amazon and Alphabet, the important January jobs report and Washington\u2019s discussion of stimulus could all be important to markets in the week ahead, but none of it is likely to get more attention than the short squeezes driven by retail investors.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks had a rocky week, with the S&amp;P 500 down 3.3% to 3,714. The S&amp;P was down 1.1% for January, its first negative month since October and a warning for the year, according to the old Wall Street adage.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe were due for some type of decline. We\u2019ve been straight up since October. It\u2019s not unusual that we\u2019re backing off a bit,\u201d said Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities.\n*****\n&gt; Trading could remain bumpy in the coming week, as the S&amp;P 500 struggles to hold above 3,716 its 50-day moving average and a key technical level.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis is the first time we\u2019re at the 50-day moving average since early November,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. \u201cIt\u2019s just a level we haven\u2019t seen in a while and it\u2019s an important first line in the sand of whether the market uses this as a pivot spot to bounce again.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe buy the dip mentality doesn\u2019t die easy, but if you break that [50-day], that portends something else,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Massocca and others see little impact on the broader market from the phenomena of retail investors piling into stocks that are being shorted by big investors. Fueled by no fee trading, retail investors created a flurry of trading in GameStop and other heavily shorted names, like AMC Entertainment. If the stocks rise, in theory, the firms that are short sellers will have to buy stock to cover, and that activity could drive the price even higher in a so-called short squeeze.\n*****\n&gt; GameStop was the poster child for that trade this past week. GameStop shares closed 68% higher on Friday, bringing their gain for the week to 400%. The retailer\u2019s shares hit a high of $483 on Jan. 28.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis is somewhat isolated,\u201d Massocca said of trading in GameStop and other shorts. He said it may not be a phenomena for that long since there aren\u2019t that many heavily shorted stocks. \u201cI think they may be hunting new names.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The short squeeze story has garnered broad interest, in the general news media and from Washington.\n*****\n&gt; Lawmakers from both parties are eager to look into the fact that Robinhood and other online brokers restricted trading in the hottest short names when trading was frenzied. Robinhood said it was responding to SEC rules on net capital requirements and clearinghouse deposits that brokers have to comply with.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis was the busiest week for earnings reported with 82% of the companies reported better than expected earnings. It\u2019s a really good quarter, but obviously overshadowed by the short squeeze news,\u201d said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management.\n*****\n&gt; He said some of the biggest tech names have been lagging, like Apple and Microsoft.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe combination of demanding valuations and short squeeze news has overshadowed a really good performance of corporate earnings so far,\u201d Grohowski said. \u201cWe\u2019re constructive on the market. Fundamentals do look encouraging to us.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Strategists have expected a pullback in the first part of the year, and many say it would become a buying opportunity. Hedge funds did sell long positions in the past week, but firms like Morgan Stanley and Barclays say the de-leveraging is not likely to have a big impact on stocks.\n*****\n&gt; But for investors who end up buying in at the end of the short squeezes, they could feel some pain.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI do think this isn\u2019t going to end well,\u201d said Grohowski. \u201cThese kind of one way trades they don\u2019t end well particularly for those that come later to the party.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think this will be one of those,\u201d he said. \u201cGameStop is not worth what it is trading for today. I do believe at the end of the day the value of a company is important and it\u2019s going to be driven by fundamentals. These dislocations and distortions of value, they will correct and many will be hurt by that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But Grohowski said it\u2019s encouraging that the surge in retail activity was driven by younger investors.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve wanted for some time for this younger generation to be more interested in the financial markets and equity investing,\u201d he said. \u201cI know a lot of experienced market participants were not anticipating it being this way. It\u2019s not just a one time kind of distortion.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think this is thought-provoking in terms of a way a younger generation might be looking at investing, by their rules, not the rules of the traditional market participants,\u201d Grohowski added.\n*****\n&gt; He expects the January employment report to get some attention Friday, and it should be weaker with just 50,000 to 60,000 jobs added.\n*****\n&gt; He said the markets will also monitor the progress of stimulus discussions in Washington, as valuations have risen on expectations of a package coming soon. President Joe Biden has proposed $1.9 trillion in spending, but Republicans are not in agreement.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/bb0C5P2.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/WeJwLEK.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DryYzFs.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/I3EtDfQ.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pDwyNEL.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/h684dcm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ACH6EjE.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/QNRfGTm.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kyPHRhw.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/oFj0dTH.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/F5eaJkL.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/gYRNWRF.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/BV3Iqsx.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # How Stocks Perform in a President\u2019s First Year\n\n&gt; 2021 kicks off the first year of a new four-year presidential cycle. One of the most popular questions we\u2019ve received lately is how have stocks performed historically during this political year.\n\n&gt; For starters, the S&amp;P 500 Index historically has gained 6.8% per year during the first year of the four-year presidential cycle, but stocks have done better when the president was re-elected than when someone new occupied the White House. This makes sense, as a new president could bring new policies and potential uncertainty. Additionally, stocks do better during years three and four under a new president, while they are much weaker early in the cycle.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.27.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, breaking down all the quarters of the four-year presidential cycle shows that the first quarter of the first year in the cycle is one of only two quarters with a negative average return.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.27.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Bigger picture, historically the fourth quarter of the year has been the strongest of the year, with the first quarter the second best on average. Don\u2019t forget, the third quarter is usually a weak one. Please note, below is for all years, not just the first year of the cycle.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.27.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We will take a closer look at February returns next week on the blog, but it is worth noting that when a new party is in power in the White House, historically stocks have struggled from late January until early March. \u201cIt is interesting, but from around the time of the inauguration to several weeks out, stocks tend to be pretty weak,\u201d according to LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIt may be as simple as new leadership could bring with it new policies and added uncertainty\u201d.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.27.21-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Will GameStop Stop The Bull Market?\n\n&gt; \u201cIn the short term, the market is a popularity contest. In the long term, the market is a weighing machine.\u201d -Warren Buffett\n\n&gt; The incredible action from some of the most heavily shorted names has investors everywhere wondering what it all means? GameStop (GME) specifically has taken the country\u2019s imagination by storm, as the stock started the year under $20 per share and this morning nearly hit $500.\n\n&gt; Please note, we aren\u2019t allowed to discuss individual equities, and in no way are we recommending any stocks in this blog, but from a bigger perspective, what is happening here? Basically, individual investors are using message boards like Reddit to find some of the most shorted stocks, then they all pile in at the same time, forcing large institutions to cover their shorts, and thus producing massive buying pressure.\n\n&gt; LPL Research doesn\u2019t think these parabolic moves reflect an overall unhealthy market, but institutions covering shorts at sizable losses may be removing capital from some big cap names. \u201cWhile these developments could be another sign of excessive optimism in certain segments of the equity markets, we do not believe they represent a sign of a broader market bubble or indicate a major correction is forthcoming,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, overall market breadth is extremely healthy and the credit markets are functioning just fine\u2014we don\u2019t see a repeat of 1999 like some are claiming.\u201d\n\n&gt; Lastly, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, after a 72% rally in the S&amp;P 500 Index (and more in small caps and the Nasdaq), maybe it is simply time for a break. After all, the current bull market has tracked almost perfectly the start of the 1982 and 2009 bull markets thus far, and both of those took a break for a few months starting around this point in the cycle.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.28.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Most Heavily Shorted Stocks at the End of 2020 and Now\n\n&gt; In the table below, we show the 20 stocks in the Russell 3000 that currently have the highest short interest as a percentage of float. It should come as no surprise that GameStop (GME) still tops that list with 122.97% of float short as of the most recent data for mid-month. That is even after a 21.36 percentage point drop from the end of 2020 when 144.34% of shares were short. It was also the most heavily shorted stock then. The runner-up is Dillard's (DDS) which currently has 83.04% of shares sold short compared to over 90% at the end of 2020. Again, despite that sizeable decline in the percentage of shares sold short, it was also the second most heavily shorted stock one month ago. Of the rest of the top 20, there are six other names with lower short interest than the end of last year. Looking across the rest of the most heavily shorted stocks, Sumo Logic (SUMO), American Well Corp (AMWL), and Sunpower (SPWR) are the stocks that have seen their short interest as a percentage of equity float rise the most. In terms of stock price performance, SPWR has been the one with the biggest rally having doubled YTD. The only other stock that has doubled YTD in this cohort has been GME.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012921-Short-2.png))**\n\n&gt; In the table below, we show the stocks that have seen the biggest changes in the percent of shares sold short between the end of 2020 and the most recent data as of January 15th. Those currently in the top 20 most shorted stocks are highlighted in gray. Across the entire Russell 3,000, 1,777 stocks have seen their short interest as a percent of short move lower in the two week period from the end of December to mid-January. As shown, even after the massive short squeeze that has taken place, GME is actually not the stock that has seen the biggest decline in shorts. Relay Therapeutics (RLAY) holds that title with a 22.62 percentage point decline. That is even though the stock has experienced a relatively smaller move than some of its peers. Granted, a number of other stocks like nCino (NCNO) and Berkeley Lights (BPYU) to name a few have actually moved lower so far in 2020 and have also seen their short interest decline significantly. On the other end of the spectrum, WW International (WW) has seen its short interest rise the most.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012921-Short-3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Funding Markets Full of Cash\n\n&gt; US funding markets are awash with liquidity thanks to ongoing QE purchases by the Fed and the progression of fiscal policy since the end of the year, as well as normal seasonal tailwinds that see more liquidity after year-end balance sheet constraints would roll off. Funding markets refer to collateralized, short-term lending via repo and related wholesale cash transactions.\n\n&gt; Government money market funds that are allowed to conduct repo operations as well as buying Treasury and Agency debt are seeing roughly typical inflows, but those come on top of record share of overall money market funds. As a result, repo rates have been plunging. The secured overnight financing rate, which tracks the volume-weighted general collateral repo rate has fallen to 3 basis points above the bottom of the Fed Funds target range. While repo rates falling below the Fed Funds target range wouldn\u2019t be a catastrophe and some parts of the market have gotten there, it\u2019s not in the FOMC\u2019s interest to have funding rates trading far outside its target policy rate range on a regular basis.\n\n&gt; The solution already exists, of course: the NY Fed has a standing overnight reverse repo facility first introduced back in 2013 which is likely to start draining cash as investors seek higher returns than the repo markets offer. Reserve scarcity, which roll-off brought to bear in 2018 and 2019, is now reserve plenty, and so many reserves exist that the NY Fed will start draining them with reverse repos. Reserve balances will continue to grow this year thanks to QE purchases and an expected decline in the balance of the federal government's transaction account at the Federal Reserve.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/FI012721-Email-1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Federal Reserve Rebukes Hawkish Rumors; Reaffirms Support\n\n&gt; It has been a busy past 12 months for the Federal Reserve (Fed), after the onset of the global pandemic prompted historic stimulus from monetary policymakers. With the economy showing signs of being in the early stages of expansion, some have speculated that the Fed may begin to slow the pace of its asset purchases. Recent comments from some Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members that have hinted that the Fed\u2019s bond buying program could be reduced by the end of the year, has signaled that other policymakers may be thinking that way, too.\n\n&gt; Adding fuel to the speculation, the 10-year Treasury yield has been climbing, breaking above 1% for the first time since March 2020 as the economy has expanded. Meanwhile, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, breakeven inflation rates\u2014the yield difference between Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) and nominal Treasuries\u2014have risen to levels not seen since 2018, suggesting that inflation expectations are heating up, although levels still remain largely benign.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog-1.28.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending February 1st, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V94ymesUu6M))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.1.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6Mo-UzI6sA))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$AMZN** \n&gt; * **$BABA** \n&gt; * **$PFE** \n&gt; * **$UPS** \n&gt; * **$PINS** \n&gt; * **$PYPL** \n&gt; * **$SNAP** \n&gt; * **$GOOGL** \n&gt; * **$XOM** \n&gt; * **$F** \n&gt; * **$QCOM** \n&gt; * **$TMO** \n&gt; * **$PTON** \n&gt; * **$ABBV** \n&gt; * **$APPS** \n&gt; * **$SPOT** \n&gt; * **$ON** \n&gt; * **$ATVI** \n&gt; * **$CLX** \n&gt; * **$BMY** \n&gt; * **$BP** \n&gt; * **$GILD** \n&gt; * **$CMG** \n&gt; * **$EA** \n&gt; * **$OTIS** \n&gt; * **$EBAY** \n&gt; * **$QTNT** \n&gt; * **$NXPI** \n&gt; * **$FEYE** \n&gt; * **$VRTX** \n&gt; * **$SIRI** \n&gt; * **$CRUS** \n&gt; * **$MRK** \n&gt; * **$PLUS** \n&gt; * **$LGND** \n&gt; * **$BIIB** \n&gt; * **$PENN** \n&gt; * **$HOG** \n&gt; * **$ARLP** \n&gt; * **$MDC** \n&gt; * **$REGN**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/kyPHRhw.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/myuWHWV.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S MARKET OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/q91df3Y.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.1.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NdQkkzk.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.1.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/AAcXfFB.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  2.2.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QT1OWPD.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 2.2.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/iCCznAX.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.3.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dmpe9og.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.3.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JR7YpHJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.4.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8PY4prv.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.4.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dlWq3SK.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.5.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/xijfQcu.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.5.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Amazon.com, Inc. -\n**Amazon.com, Inc.

        "selftext": "I got two goals here. One is for you to understand what Salesforce and SAP really do instead of just \"cloud\" and \"software\" and why Salesforce will become like SAP. The second is to tell you what to expect with CRM price and how to make tendies.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst you gotta understand what exactly SAP does and what happened with their stock. SAP is one of the largest software companies which focus on ERP. What the fuck is ERP you might ask? ERP is what other businesses use to track business resources. This ranges from everything such as planning and optimizing manufacturing capacity to dealing with payroll for employees. Basically companies don't want to create their own software for handling these wide range of tasks and pay SAP a shit load of money to do it for them. Where's the problem you might ask? Unless you are involved with one of these companies that use SAP, it's difficult to understand what the experience is like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/htsfvr8uro861.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db3b665c95ce5d62639a4dc0e5d9469a08510cbd\n\nBasically a company pays SAP to use their software for dealing with one of these areas of ERP. This generally works fine since SAP has used their business management software with a lot of companies for the same tasks. The issue is when one of these companies want to [customize the software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning#Disadvantages) to meet unique demands for the company. This re-engineering process to fit the ERP system for many tasks ends up costing more for a company and wasting a lot of time and money. Interestingly enough, you can ask almost any business about their experience with SAP and they will all say that they're unhappy even though they use their software. So what you might ask, wouldn't SAP still be generating tons of revenue? Well yes but more of these companies are moving away from this way of doing ERP as it is an inflexible approach. This is becoming replaced by more loosely connected systems utilizing cloud instead of having a one solves all solution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ugj07ez0to861.png?width=984&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c45c19bcdd0e10bd643286730aa3a2beeec0ae20\n\nLet's look at how their financial earnings and stock price have reflected this. In the past two years this stock has traded relatively sideways with some really bad drops. Around May to August their stock price went up 60% do to the hype around cloud companies benefiting from COVID. However it has obviously taken a really bad fall when October earnings were announced. They claimed that there was slower recovery than anticipated for many of its clients. However I suspect that many of these companies have been looking to shift away from SAP as the pandemic has shown the importance of the flexibility of these systems. By looking at their past quarters, you can see that their quarterly revenue has been flat around the 8 billion range and the company is clearly having a difficult time changing their business model. Other cloud companies are replacing their solutions as SAP's clients move away from their software even though SAP is trying to shift to [modern cloud technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP#Corporate_restructuring). Generally though companies have a hard time changing their business approach from the old way of doing things to the new way of doing things. \n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow the important part. What the fuck does SAP's troubles have to do with Salesforce. As you may have guessed from the ticker Salesforce provides CRM or customer relationship management. [CRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management) is a specific area in ERP dealing with customer services. For example a company may want a software for their call center or to automate a marketing effort. Salesforce provides software to do this along with analytics of this data so that these businesses can make informed decisions.\n\nAs you may have already guessed Salesforce is facing some similar problems that SAP deal with. When a company decides to expand their CRM software to deal with more parts of their business, the inflexibility and costs quickly become apparent. [For example, many corporations only use CRM systems on a partial basis and less than 40 percent of companies have high end-user adoption rates.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management#Criticism) Again if you are not familiar with software development and companies using these software vendors it is difficult to fully understand these troubles. I would strongly recommend researching the issues of customizing ERP or CRM software for a specific company if you are not convinced. While Salesforce tries to provide an all in one solution for their clients, customization becomes complicated and prices become costly. These customizations become difficult to do and take a lot of time, planning, and money. Companies are becoming more inclined to take a different approach for building these systems. In a lot of these cases it is easier for a business to build their own system in the cloud using products from companies such as Microsoft or Amazon for more customizability. \n\nAnother big issue is the concern over customer data with CRM systems. A company might opt to develop their own CRM systems where they can ensure that customer data is obeying customer privacy laws and allows them to have more control over private data. This can help build a better relationship with the customer. Privacy issues over customer data has obviously become a big issue in 2020.\n\nFurthermore, Salesforce has been trying to get into more areas with [recent acquisitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salesforce). Similar to SAP, I suspect that Salesforce will crush over their own weight as they try to expand their company. One good example of this is their recent acquisition of Slack. Slack does not really fit any of Salesforce ecosystem and is really just an attempt to expand into a different area. Slack has a lot of competition from Microsoft teams and other companies which can do what Slack does but better. \n\nBusiness will start to move away from Salesforce similar to SAP. This is not to say that they be completely independent as Salesforce does make some parts of the businesses easier. However there seems to be a strong resemblance to SAP based on what I know from inside of a corporation using both SAP and Salesforce and the many issues they face when they try and customize their solutions.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo how can we use this information to print tendies? The expectation is that Salesforce will eventually slow their growth down while stock is overhyped due to being a cloud company and start to fall or go sideways like SAP. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vl629rb14p861.png?width=927&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4282ffef17bd83b9a62a7f196974d0113511b1d5\n\nBasically the idea is to try and play puts, especially around earnings. If Salesforce misses their guidance then it could the stock in a serious reversal especially for a cloud company with a lot of hype. The next earnings will be early March.\n\nYou can also try and play longer term puts but the stock is fairly volatile like SAP and I would only do this if you see the price go up significantly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr; buy puts in march \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclosure: long on GME \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "https://investor.fitbit.com/press/press-releases/press-release-details/2019/Fitbit-to-Be-Acquired-by-Google/default.aspx\n\nThe above is over a year old. So what is Fitbit, and why am I posting this now, then?\n\n\nFitbit is an American electronics and fitness company which focuses on health-related metrics, tracking, and data analysis. For you, what you need to know is that it sells smartwatches. \n\nAnyone who cares about watches or fashion at all, you might have heard of Fitbit. As someone who used to be big on high fashion about 2-3 years ago, Moncler was a suave yet not over-the-top brand that a lot of rich Asians and Khabib Nurmagomedov wore. https://i.imgur.com/tiONi3I.jpg. Personally for me, Fitbit has a lot of resemblance - popular enough for the cool kids wear and know, and still good for the boomers due to the functionality. \n\n\nFitbit is ranked 5th worldwide in shipments for watches, behind notably Apple, Samsung, and Xiaomi. https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS46122120\n\n\nBack in 2019, some of you boomers here might recall an announcement by Google, with plans to acquire Fitbit at a 2.1 Billion dollar USD transaction, which was halted by various legislative and activist communities due to the ongoing battle vs. FAANG+M (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, GOOG(Alphabet) + Microsoft). See: Facebook vs. US of A currently. Let me give you the spoilers on this stuff for the upcoming Biden Administration and the near future: it doesn't matter. \n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22158271/googles-fitbit-deal-eu-regulator-approval\n\n\nBig techs rule the world, that's why they are boomer stocks at this point, that's why they are blue chips. Stonks only go up? None of this exists to today without the big tech companies starting the trend and movement into this digital era, into this technological boom. Your teachers use Google to find their sources despite telling to you keep your nose in the books. Your very own senators representatives and law-makers, voting about the 25th Amendment, revisit the constitution thru Google, while actively voting against big-techs taking over the world, using... Google. \n\n\nThe very same Google is bent on acquiring Fitbit, and has received a conditional-yet-final approval from the EU commission, and will be soon to follow in the USA, I presume not long after the transition of power on the 20th. Google will acquire Fitbit due to their previous failure to breach into the smartwatches market, which exploded some ~4-5 years ago. Apple currently dominates the market, and Google wants a piece. Do you think Google will sit by idly and watch one of their prime competitors claim the throne without contest?\n\n\nGoogle recently filed a patent for a smartwatch-design which includes a heartrate tracker. It's very unlikely that after their past attempts at breaking into the watches market, that they will go ahead and just, \"TrY aGaIn\" without the proper measures taken. Fitbit is that proper measure, it's the acquisition which will get them the entry footing they need, to grow. https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-fitness-band-design-revealed-uspto/\n\n\nBut the biggest reason why I'm in Fitbit right now, is because it's a tech-involved product maker coming out of the COVID pandemic, consistently beating earnings expectations for the last 2 quarters of the pandemic, about to report yet another earnings in... ~3 weeks, speculated 1st/2nd week of February. Premiums are beyond dirt cheap also, the stock's been sideways for a year since Google's acquisition announcement over a year ago. Get in before the holiday earnings in early February.\n\n\n**TL;DR**\n- $FIT is a watch company being acquired by Google, after long halts from various legislators and committees.\n- Earnings are coming up, have consistently been beat during the pandemic, smart watch market grew ~80% YOY in 2019 and Fitbit's revenues grew during pandemic.\n- Premiums are dirt cheap, stock has long to run. If $PTON can grow into 2021, $FIT will certainly rise from the ashes.\n\n**EDIT**\n\nPOSITIONS:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/x0x2mYb\n\nDown on all, been in for over a month on all of them, some longer. Will be burnt for January calls. Time your calls to the ides of February or after - earnings are definitely not priced in.\n\nAdding some rockets for WSB literacy - \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "Bill Foley (Chairman of Fidelity National Financial and Black Knight; Owner of NHL Team: Vegas Golden Knights) has announced an acquisition in fintech.\n\nFoley has been involved in more than 100 acquisitions and many spinoffs.

        "selftext": "Just wanted to share my research on VIH (Bakkt) since I hadn't seen one and a few comments I had seen about it were misinformed ones. I have learnt a lot from this subreddit over the last year and wanted to give something back.\n\n**What is Bakkt?**\n\nBakkt is a digital asset marketplace founded in August 2018 that lets you trade bitcoin, trade bitcoin futures, peer to peer bitcoin transfer, peer to peer cash transfer, earn and spend reward points, convert reward points to cash and also use it with another merchant (think using airline miles for coffee in starbucks, or using delta airmiles for american airlines)  and stocks/options.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n03wpv1hutb61.png?width=2962&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aed8da9746fbc1dc70c2fae7cc57adf9835eb173\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Notable leadership:**\n\nGavin Michael is their new CEO. He was the head of technology at Citi Bank for four years before this. He was also Head of Digital at Chase from 2013 to 2016.\n\nAdam White is President. He was general manager and vice-president at Coinbase before he joined Bakkt in 2018.\n\nNicolas Cabrera is CPO. His previous notable roles were  co-founder and SVP Product at OneMarket (Westfield Labs)  from 2012 to 2019. He was also lead on product and digital for eBay and PayPal in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nAkshay Nehata of Softbank and Jeff Sprecher CEO of ICE sit on the board as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\"I have never heard of Bakkt\"**\n\nThe app is invite only currently with around 100,000+ active users. This is the reason why most of us have never heard of it. They have been building institutional relationships until now to allow them to offer all of the above services.  They plan full-scale rollout of the app in Q1 2021.\n\nRegarding bitcoin exchange so far they have been buying and storing bitcoin for big institutional players think microstrategy etc. ( I don't know which companies have used them to date).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What is their moat?**\n\nI think their moat at this point will be the rewards program points, the seamless aggregation of all the digital assets and the liquidity it offers across all this. Being able to use rewards points across merchants and platform will be huge for your everyday consumer whose award points across different merchants just sit around until they go and use the same company all over again. This together with all the other services that you will be able to get on just one app can be a game changer. Think cashapp+ chicago mercantile exchange+ robinhood+ rewards points transfer under one roof.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dboqfaaawtb61.png?width=3095&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b20ddfd1852e91e5021330ed54b0c3b77b5e1514\n\n**Current partners:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mmplgxd0ytb61.jpg?width=3140&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8fc19de4ca5e9c28939af90f431d8c29dd09ca8\n\n**How do they differentiate from coinbase, gemini, cashapp and paypal for crypto?**\n\nSay you want to buy 1000$ worth of bitcoin. Coinbase/cashapp/gemini will let you buy 985$ worth whereas paypal 982$. Bakkt undercuts them by 0.25% and 0.5% respectively and lets you buy 988$ worth. \n\nCoinbase and gemini  lets you trade other cryptocurrency as well while bakkt at this point does not. They are planning to add other currencies except for XRP (which have been removed from the other two mentioned apps as well).\n\n**Revenue Model:**\n\nI will let the below chart from investor presentation explain. It does it better than I'll be able to in a paragraph.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4qstx5cq2ub61.png?width=3112&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b5e1528846a7f53790632de129aeba313c2805c\n\n**Institutional investors:**\n\nThey have a very impressive group of institutional investors which include ICE, Microsoft, Boston Consulting Group, Starbucks and PayU. ICE owned 81% of the company before merging with VIH and post-merger will hold 65% of the company and they are rolling 100% of their equity stake in the company. In addition they are also investing a further 50 million dollars through PIPE.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c4k3zhnkdub61.png?width=745&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ac311759a184d9499cdbce1256efd977db35c83\n\n**Valuation:**\n\nThey had 300 billion Series B funding in early 2020 with a valuation of 1 billion. Before current merger 880 million had been invested into the company by various players. Current valuation on merger is going to be 2.1 billion dollars. This merger will allow the company to have 524 million dollars cash in hand to accelerate growth (this includes 92 million dollar in cash that is already on bakkt's balance sheet prior to merger). Important thing here is none of the previous investors are selling their stake from what I was able to find unlike other private companies that have gone public with SPACs where the previous investors were cashing in at least part of their previous investment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Revenue  Projections:**\n\nI would take them with a grain of salt as these can be over-optimistic but they have a very high CAGR which is appropriate for the kind of fintech they are.\n\nTheir main competitors in the crypto buy/sell market would be coinbase and gemini but they are undercutting them on costs and this part of the market is still in the very early phases and if they can offer a reliable app then they might capture a lot of it. For those who don't know coinbase crashes every time there are \\~10% fluctuations in a small time so you can't sell even if you want to.\n\nFor the futures market the big names in the US are CME and Binance. Okex is mainly in China. \n\nFor the rewards market their only competitors would be [points.com](https://point.com) who aren't even close to what Bakkt can offer. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gke9suwnjxb61.png?width=3108&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4f31f173ed80b477678be2856a91ba38b4836df\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TAM:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pep9dofo5ub61.png?width=3143&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c3b0fa28690a2c46998784c8d9f91ce18e91c16\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCryptocurrency and digital currency is the future with more and more institutional involvement it is a matter of time before a broader adoption. This will come with time but it is very important to understand this is not the only way Bakkt wants to capture and get a hold in the market.\n\nI think Bakkt went public at this time given the euphoria in general in current stock market as well the cryptocurrency market otherwise they would have waited a year or two before they went public. Going  public now allows them to tap the public market without doing another series of private funding to allow for aggressive marketing and growth. The ongoing active involvement of a big institution like ICE and their 100% rolling of equity to me is bullish and shows their commitment and belief in it. Their CEO  Jeffrey Sprecher has been actively involved in Bakkt's growth and pointed it out for growth in last year's investor call. Having said this Bakkt is a high risk high reward play for post-merger holders as the app is about to rollout and will depend on how quickly they are able to entice users. They have all the right ideas, tools, institutional infrastructure and partnerships but has yet to be executed on a large scale except for the bitcoin futures trading and institutional bitcoin trading which are already ongoing.\n\nBefore merger major catalysts for other traders would be announcement of further major partnerships (apple, major airlines etc) as well as a possible Mad Money Cramer pump as he has already had an exclusive combined interview for CNBC with ICE CEO Sprecher and Bakkt CEO Michael.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This is my limited research into the company please feel free to add or correct something. Invest according to your risk tolerance. I currently hold commons in VIH and planning to hold long-term.",

        "selftext": "This is my first DD so I hope it goes well.\n\nCC Neuberger Principal Holdings I (PCPL) has an agreement to merge with E2OPEN.\n\n**What is E2OPEN?**: E2OPEN is a cloud-based, artificial intelligence, on-demand SaaS platform company. E2OPEN is the largest cloud-based provider of networked supply chain applications. More than 70,000 partner companies and 200,000 users, many of the biggest companies in the world use the E2OPEN network today.\n\n**Who are E2OPEN's customers?**: Some of their customers include Google, Facebook, AMD, Nvidia, Intel, HP, IBM etc. [Complete list taken from the investor presentation.](https://i.imgur.com/FfcVX7o.png)\n\n**Who is leading the SPAC?**: The founder &amp; CEO of PLPC is Chinh Chu. A billionaire with 30+ years of investment experience, including 25 years at [Blackstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blackstone_Group). He has created 3 SPACs since 2016. The first SPAC, CF Corp, raised $1.2 billion and successfully merged with Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Life. The second SPAC, Collier Creek Holdings, raised $475 million and successfully merged with a company in the consumer sector. And now we have his most recent, third SPAC, PCPL. It has raised $414 million and will merge with E2OPEN. This man was also in charge of taking Dun &amp; Bradstreet private in a large $7.2 billion deal. Before joining Blackstone in 1990, this man also worked in the Mergers &amp; Acquisitions Deparment at Salomon Brothers. His experience is undeniable. \n\n**Backstory**: E2OPEN used to be a public company. Their stock price went as high as $28. They were bought by a private company and were taken off the market in 2015. Ever since they were taken private, E2OPEN was able to grow from $80M in revenue 5 years ago to $335M in 2020. They have acquired a handful of companies and continue to do so. E2OPEN's revenue is about four times what it was in 2015. The percent of revenue that is subscription-based, which is always a key metric for a SaaS company, was 80% in fiscal 2020 and is expected to grow in 2021. It also stands to benefit as companies automate their supply chains further in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**The potential negatives:** Their estimated revenue for next year is about +10%. There was an additional funding from instutions through a private investment in public equity (PIPE) of $175M which will be used to pay down existing debt. E2OPEN traded publicly before they were acquired by another company. Their stock price went as high as $28 but also went as low as $8. They were then acquired by Insight Venture Partners and have grown since. \n\n**The Merger**: SPAC shareholders will own 20% of the shares. The merger has a valuation of $2.57B. Upon closing of the transaction with E2OPEN, the ticker will change from 'PCPL' to 'ETWO'.\n\n**TL:DR:** A cloud-based SaaS platform company with customers from some of the biggest corporations in the world today, has a definitive agreement to merge with 'PCPL'. PCPL is run by a billionaire with an unbelievable resume that has already had two previous successful SPAC mergers and this is his third SPAC. The company's revenue has grown massively and their revenue today is about four times higher than it was in 2015. The percent of their revenue that is subscription-based is 80% and is expected to grow in the future. \n\n**Disclaimer:** I own 420 shares of PCPL. Invest at your own risk. As of this writing the price of PCPL is **$10,84.**",

        "selftext": "In early Q1 P-C-P-L is merging with E2open. E2open has disruptive AI / Cloud technology for the supply-chain industry. They are widely used by big name customers including Google, Microsoft, Boeing, Walmart, Coca Cola, UPS, AMD, NVIDIA, Abbott, and dozens of others.\n\nWhat differentiates them from other (more boring) supply chain management companies is the way they use AI to predict changes in supply and demand. Basically, E2open allows companies to see 10 steps ahead into the future to forecast how much inventory they will need based on hundreds of variables (geopolitics, resource availability, etc). This saves companies hundreds of millions in waste. CEO Michael Farlekas  compares it to working at a lemonade stand and being able to know ahead of time exactly how many lemons you will need. Obviously this will save you from wasting money on lemons that would spoil. E2open is the only company that integrates this type of AI technology with a vast data Cloud network.\n\nE2open uses a subscription model to make consistent sustainable revenue from their 1000+ customers. There are multiple services they offfer, but over 50% of their customers only use 1 service. What's nice is that existing customers go on to utilize more and more of their services as they realize the value it adds to their companies. Google for example paid E2open twice as much over the course of 2 years. E2open makes additional revenue from new customers, and also by strategic value-adding acquisitions. The SPAC deal is allowing E2open to clean up their balance sheet so they can add value to their software portfolio (and charge higher premiums to existing customers) and continue making acquisitions.\n\nE2open has been growing at a rapid clip since they were taken private in 2015. In 2015 they made $80M in revenue and in 2020 they made $335M. That's 420% growth in 5 years, or roughly +84% growth per year.\n\nIn the last 5 years they increased their revenue +420% by value-adding acquisitions they've made over the last decade --- Icon (2013), Serus Corp (2014), Terra Technology (2016), Orchestro (2016), Steelwedge (2017), Zyme (2017), Entomo and Birch Worldwide (2018), Inttra (2018), and Amber Road (2018) --- and integrating these different services to create a beautiful comprehensive end-to-end platform.\n\nSomewhat surprisingly, their projections for 2021 are much lower at only +10% estimated revenue growth, which is the main reason most would argue P-C-P-L is trading so close to the NAV. However, 10% growth is actually really solid when you look at their margins and consider that 80% of their revenue is recurring with excellent customer retention. Institutional investors especially will appreciate E2open as the reliable revenue generating machine that it has  become. \n\nI'm also still optimistic about valuing E2open as a growth stock and feel the 10% is a low-ball estimate based on comparisons to the median growth of other supply chain management companies. I'm suspecting E2open will consistently  outperform expectations on a quarterly as the SPAC capital equips them to capitalize on their services, continue making acquisitions, and ultimately tap into millions in white space opportunity.\n\nEven if E2open maintained a 10% growth rate  and if this were factored into its valuation, $11/share is still too damn low. E2open compares itself to Descartes, Kinaxis, Manhattan, and Spscommerce. With a median of 10.7x revenue, E2 was only at 7x, and with a median of 34.7x, E2 was only at 21.3x, meaning E2open has a much higher upside than its peers.\n\nInstitutions will bring the stock price up to par with it's peers and I believe the low ball projected growth is a conservative number that they will completely destroy when you consider their growth of +400% over the last 5 years. While 10% is perfectly fine for a company like E2open, I'm expecting the trend of the last 5 years to continue in 2021 and we'll be seeing some exciting numbers. \n\nMy PT pre-merge is 15 and 25 EOY assuming their projected 10% revenue growth. If E2open surpasses 2021 expected revenue as I'm suspecting and they have major quarterly beats, I'm holding until 50.\n\nDisclaimer: This is my largest position. I'm in 2500 shares at 10.87.",

I'll link to the original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kvrv7b/cathie_arkbacked_tech_innovator_kratos_defense/) as it will likely be a more interesting read and im not great at formatting. \n\nI thought i'd look into them and I was pretty pleased with what I saw.\n\nI attended the presentation, and this is what I managed to jot down during the presentation. I'm sure it'll look very boring, but maybe for you its worth reading.

        "selftext": "I haven't invested since August, and their haven't been any dips in the market since early November. Even then, it was a small dip and the market shot up 800 points or so for the next few days. The market also seems to not be making any sense because every time the unemployment numbers are increasing the market shoots up.\n\nIt's mainly due to injections of liquidity from the fed reserve. But, at some point the house of cards has to fall. A lot of these companies that are going up are IPOs that solely went up because of niche markets that would not have been as big if the coronavirus had not have happened ex: peloton, zoom, some cloud stocks etc. Now it's hard to even find a stock under $100 because the whole market has been overflooded with newby investors, liquidity, and activist hedge funds that are trying to keep retail and manufacturing relevant that is keeping the blue chip stocks propped up as well. \n\nWith that said, at these prices is it still worth it to buy a couple shares of these overvalued firms like Zoom, Netflix, Amazon, Peloton, Tesla etc. \n\nLook for another IPO that may or may not go up? Draft Kings, Air bnb, Snowflake, beyond meat, rackspace, etc\n\nOr just wait it out logically like Buffett used to say in one of speeches be patient and only buy something if you know you can hold it for 10s. However, the more I feel I'm waiting the more I feel like I'm just letting my money sit doing nothing and I'm losing out on opportunity cost. These values just make no sense though, and every IPO that comes out sees even higher percentage gains than the one before it. The regular blue chip stocks that are steady like Microsoft, Visa, Proctor and Gamble, Walmart etc that seem like the best companies profit, revenue, and management wise don't rise up in value near as much as some poorly invested startup IPO in a niche market that has negative earnings every quarter. It just makes no sense. \n\nSo, basically is it still worth it to invest in 2021, or should we all just sit out and wait for it to drop like how much higher can it go?  \nAnd if so what makes for better investments in our current times blue chips that are less worrisome, tech companies, solar/renewables, or IPOs?",

Let\u2019s start by talking a little about [AMD](https://ibb.co/d0cPRrj), they are one of the biggest semiconductor companies in the world, and they operate in multiple segments like Computing, Gaming, Enterprise, Semi-Custom and many more with some of the most important products for the company being microprocessors and GPUs both for personal use like (gaming consoles &amp; PCs) while also offering products for professional use like data centers.\n\nThe company was founded more than 50 years ago and have more than 11K employees, with the company overperforming recently as they have seen a more than 80% rise in the last year.\n\nSo, guys, let\u2019s go a little through the 4th quarter &amp; yearly [results](https://ibb.co/f0CLSF7) for AMD. The company reported a revenue of $3.24B in the 4th quarter, with a 53% growth since last year, while for the full year they earned almost $10B as they more than doubled they quarterly and full year net income, which resulted in a $1.29 earnings/share for the year.\n\nThe [company](https://ibb.co/TY6trfs) has 2 major income segments in Computing &amp; Graphics which brought in sales of over $6.4B for the year and an operating income of $1.26B and the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment which brought in $3.3B in revenues and almost $400M in operating income. They also provide an additional segment that doesn\u2019t bring in any revenues but which represents costs that can\u2019t be associated with any of the other 2 segments, but also includes stock-based compensations and acquisitions related costs.\n\nBoth of these 2 [segments](https://ibb.co/qdfVyrK) have seen huge increases in the past year with operating income doubling for the computing &amp; graphics segment and increasing by almost 50% for the EEC segment.\n\n[AMD](https://ibb.co/tYmkPwg) didn\u2019t have such a big capital expenditure in 2020, with only $294M but this can increase depending on the demand of their products while they also [adjusted](https://ibb.co/hCtfk2k) their income with $312M in depreciation &amp; amortizations. Both of these numbers have increased by 40 to 50% in the past years and will be important in the DCF valuation. \n\nThey have also managed to increase the gross profit margin to 45%, up 2% from 2019 as their earnings before interest &amp; tax or [EBIT](https://ibb.co/xDptyzW) stood at $1.37B.\n\nThe company has seen a continued earnings per share [growth](https://ibb.co/FhLj0Y7) overall, despite the first 2 quarters of 2020 coming in lower than previous, but that was to be expected as this was impacted by the reduced [revenues](https://ibb.co/QdjCvnx) in Q1 &amp; Q2 before things started to pick up back again, as they finished with a huge increase overall in the 4th quarter.\n\nTheir product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/YkjNDbY) has become a great challenge to Intel\u2019s market share and is continuing to evolve, as Intel is still struggling to regain momentum with their products.\n\n[AMD](https://ibb.co/XX3h4CD) announced the world\u2019s best processors for laptop and an enterprise variant that is expected to be available in the first half of 2021.\n\nThey have also launched the fastest [AMD](https://ibb.co/fQQnFj4) gaming graphics card ever while also [working](https://ibb.co/D9dDDYs) with big companies like Amazon on their AWS cloud offerings &amp; Microsoft Azure which are planning to use their upcoming 3rd generation EPYC processors.\n\nAMD is also involved in supercomputers which indicates that they are continuing to innovate and develop products that will be in high demand for the foreseeable future\n\nThe one big thing that can propel AMD even more in the future is the proposed acquisition or more rather merger with [Xilinx](https://ibb.co/N2YQFS9), which also beat earnings expectations the other day, with revenues of over $800M for the quarter and a Free Cash Flow of 44% of their revenues. [Xilinx](https://ibb.co/QH8RTCN) has a market cap of over $32B, and the combination of the 2 companies would [create](https://ibb.co/qJM6Gn4) synergies. [They](https://ibb.co/PcNhH58) are targeting an all-stock transaction which will have implications on my projections, but as time has gone, the $35B price tag is only a 10% premium for Xilinx. The one hurdle the companies have to pass is the regulatory procedures. We will have to wait and see if the deal goes through or not, as it\u2019s expected the deal should be finished by the end of the year, with AMD shareholders retaining 74% of the new group shares and Xilinx holding the remaining 26%.\n\nAMD also offered great [guidance](https://ibb.co/n649gFm) for 2021 as they expect the strength of their product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/Xbx5TV4) to push AMD revenues up 37% over 2020 and also expect their gross margin to increase to 47%, while they [expect](https://ibb.co/RpcwXYr) an effective tax rate for next year of 15%, well belove the 21% US corporate tax rate.\n\nI have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates and expectations. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on\u2026\n\nSo, let\u2019s start with the Unleveraged discounted free cash flow [projections](https://ibb.co/hKFMswn) to see what the current valuation of the company is.\n\nI used their total revenues projections that we will discuss later on in the long-term projection and the net income for 2020 to which I added back the Depreciation &amp; Amortization costs they had in 2020 and got to a $1.68B EBITDA. \n\nFor the next years I used 1% increase in EBIT margin which I think they can achieve pretty easy and an increase in capex of 10%/year in order to maintain an increased production capacity while also applying a 15% decrease in their net working capital.\n\nSo, for an 8% discount rate, which is pretty much the Average SP500 return, we get a $9.7B Discounted Free Cash Flow by 2025.\n\nNow there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for both of them we do have to subtract or add the net assets or debt, which in this case stands $5.75B in assets. I personally think a use of the average is better suited for most companies, though some of the companies trade largely on the EBITDA approach and other on the growth approach. \n\nIf we use the growth approach, we can see that AMD is pretty fairly valued right now, as this implies a loss of 2%, while on the other hand the EBITDA multiple approach gives us a valuation of over $112, meaning an almost 30% undervaluation of the company. But as I said, I think a use of the average is best, so, my current price target for AMD in 2021 is $98.82, implying a 13.5% return from the last price.\n\nAnd now let\u2019s move on to a longer-term valuation of the company based on the growth projections I have for AMD.\n\nFor my [projections](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr) I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream. I think we can continue to see 50% growth rate in the EEC segment for 2021 and then implying a gradual slowing of their growth, while for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment I implied a 35% growth, way lower than the over 100% they saw in 2020, also implying a gradual slowdown of the trend by 2025.\n\nI think these growth implications are pretty reasonable giving the high [demand](https://ibb.co/vQFwyRd) the company has seen for their entire product line, especially as gaming revenues have continued to increase, and also taking into account the need for their products in data centers, cloud usage &amp; digital currency mining.\n\nFor their cost of [sales](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr), I started from the current ones which stand at 80% for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment and implied a 1% improvement each year, while for the EEC segment I started from the 88% expense margin right now and implied a gradual 2% improvement. I also maintained their other expense regarding to the cost of sales to 3% of their total revenues, in-line with the previous years.\n\nThis means for [2025](https://ibb.co/swQfJgf) we would get just over $33B in revenues and $26B in expenses, resulting in a gross profit of almost $7B. I also maintained the same capex as in the DCF and also [substracted](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) the interest &amp; other expenses for which I implied a 5% annual growth, thus leading us to a $6.28B in earnings before tax. \n\nI [maintained](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) their 15% effective tax rate projections and also diluted their shares by 1% each year accounting for some dilution in the stock.\n\nSo, for the $5.3B in 2025 revenues after tax and accounting for 1.27B shares, that would mean a $4.21 earnings/share, meaning the [stock](https://ibb.co/HYzfCkz) is trading at 20 times forward price to earnings for 2025.\n\nI like to base my future projections on Forward/PE valuations so, with the current projected PE and depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 25 and 40, the stock can trade between $105 and almost $168.   \n\nSo, after all these estimates what are my price targets? [HERE](https://ibb.co/SyN8bn9) are my actual price targets\u2026 I think the 2025 bear case price we can see AMD trade at is $115 which would imply a return of almost 33% , while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that AMD will trade at 137$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 57% return on the current price. But my most bullish case would see the company trading at $158, which would imply a return of over 81%. So yeah guys, [THIS](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rkJLAXxwqbo6WEfR9NfPEKZagiW4EVbRsz58ejqTVEI) are my Overall price targets for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 25 &amp; 30 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 30 and 35 PE\u2019s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 35-40. \n\nSo [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rkJLAXxwqbo6WEfR9NfPEKZagiW4EVbRsz58ejqTVEI) is the full spreadsheet that I have projected for AMD by 2025, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.\n\nI think these are pretty reasonable [targets](https://ibb.co/9NTJYmP), as the semiconductors industry will keep on booming in the next decade, as the world will need more &amp; more chips that also keep advancing in technology. \n\nThe company also has very good [financials](https://ibb.co/NCtxnFq), with almost $9B in assets vs just $3.1B in total liabilities, which can be easily paid by just the current assets.\n\nAnd let\u2019s also take a look at what the estimates are from the [analysts](https://ibb.co/G0QpnrW). We can only see EPS estimates until 2023 of $3.22, which I think is safe to say can grow an additional dollar by 2025, so my projections are pretty in-line with what other experts anticipate.\n\nSo, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for AMD?\n\nLet\u2019s look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/wQw6CQP), the stock just broke below the long-term uptrend but has seen good support at the $86-87 levels, which is where the next support should stand. We saw AMD pushing towards $100 in the beginning of the year, but it hit major resistance once [Intel](https://ibb.co/pjHdVFQ) also announced a change in their leadership, as they brought in the WMWare CEO Gelsinger, but it\u2019s very hard to see him turn around Intel in a very short time. Intel will need some years &amp; a lot of capital expenditure to turn things around, if they do manage to do it at all. \n\nAMD hasn\u2019t been overbought since August, and currently has an RSI near 41, which is pretty oversold for a good company, so I expect to see them regaining some momentum in the near-term, but I guess the market is very busy with the current short-squeezes. AMD will se a lot of resistance breaking through the $100 level, not because of something fundamental with the company, but I guess it\u2019s a psychological resistance rather.\n\nAnd let\u2019s take a quick look at what 24 [analysts](https://ibb.co/bKRQwXP) on Wall Street are saying. They mostly have a buy call on the company with an average price target of $100 and a high price target of $135. So, I think the analyst are pretty spot on with AMD, but my PT are slightly lower as it\u2019s always better to undershoot and overperform rather than the other way around.\n\nSo, what would I do? Well, I own AMD stock and I believe it still has plenty of room to grow, so I would start building a position right now and add on any weakness, and I would especially buy more if the stock drops even lower than 80$.\n\nOne last thing to mention about AMD is that they also have a very big % of their [shares](https://ibb.co/zZcxm95) held by institutions, with over 74% of the float being held by big funds like Vanguard &amp; Blackrock which does significantly reduce the sell-off possibilities.\n\nSo, this are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think [Lisa SU](https://ibb.co/X2nVGTF) has done a terrific job since becoming the CEO, and has driven AMD to a renewed approach to their business, as the [company](https://ibb.co/WtBf4yF) has been booming in the past 5 years, growing more than twice as much as Nvidia and crushing the SP500 and Intel\u2019s performance.\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "* The market performed strongly today with tech stock leading the way. Big tech such as FB and GOOGL closed up 3.9% and 3.3%, while MSFT closed up almost 1.8%. Conversely, select sectors were punished today as a rotation of sort occurred. Retail/consumer storefront took a beating with WMT down -0.86%, COST down -2.12%, TGT down -3.41%, DG down -2.54%, and BBY down -2.11%.\n\n* It's another spectacular pump day for WSB cult gang as a new religion is formed where GME is the deliverance and the Moon (or Mars?) is the promised land. GME opened at a strong 15%+ and went as high as 25%+ intraday to $45.52 but a tweet by Andrew \"tool bag\" Left of Citron at 6:58 derailed the party and send shares under $37 before the bull run continued. Shares of GME closed $39.36 as shorts continue to be squeezed, though the momentum has clearly be snapped a bit.\n\n* Over at BB land, shares of BlackBerry Ltd. pumped another 25% as the market continues to shift the company's valuation as the Canadian company chugs on with their focus on enterprise security software/service. BB closed up 25.51% to $12.35. \n\n* NFLX reported stellar numbers as sub count tops 200 mil. New net sub numbered in 8.5 mil, an uptick of 2.2 mil from the previous quarter and beats previous projection of 6 mil by 2.5 mil. NFLX sees Q1 additions of 6 mil. While Q4 EPS was $1.19 vs $1.39, NFLX sees Q1 EPS of $2.97 vs consensus of $2.10, further propelling the stock. Implied move was about 8% for weeklies so for those who YOLO'ed you're gucci as long as you didn't buy some retardedly OTM strike. NFLX is up 12.5% as of writing in AH to $564. DIS is up 2% AH and ROKU is up about 1.6%.\n\n* GM pumped more than 9% today on news of MSFT 2 bil investment in GM's self-driving startup Cruise, valuing the side hustle at 30 bil. The boomer stock has low-key been killing it in the past few years and as Model 3 replaces the entry-level 3 series and C class in various neighborhoods, you'll likely see GM EVs replacing various Hondas and Toyotas in the coming years as well. GM closed up 9.75% to $54.84.\n\n* Bank/financial earnings continues with BAC and GS reporting this morning. Both reported strong quarters tho the run-up may have been a bit too much as both underlyings faced the same sell-off pressure their sector faced last Thursday. BAC authorized a 2.9 bil repurchase plan, shares closed the day down slightly -0.73% to $32.77 while GS closed -2.26% to $294.\n\n* Incoming Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urges Biden to act big to further help the rona punished economy, but also made some notes on raising corporate rates eventually (once the US overcomes rona). With Yellen set to replace Mnunchin, those who enjoyed Mnunchin's various stimulus phone tag with Pelosi will no doubt miss the \"stimulus talks are going well\" pumps.\n\n* Shares of home builders reacted favorably to Biden's $15,000 first-time homebuyer tax credit proposal, though it will likely face an uphill battle in Congress given the various scope and size of the overall stimulus package. LEN is up 2%, DHI up 2.8%, PHM up 3%, NVR up 3.74%, and KBH up 5.5%.\n\n* In WSB meme stock land not named GME and BB, ICLN closed up 2.75% as the cleantech pump resumes, while MT took a beating of -4% to closed at $22.96, despite a slight PT raise of .5 Euro by Morgan Stanley. Surely metal gang won't be another tanker gang situation.\n\n* The DOW closed up 0.38% or 116 pts, Nasdaq up a strong 1.53% or 198 pts, SPX up 0.81% or 30 pts, and RUT is up 1.32% or almost 28 pts.\n\n* Notable ERs and numbers later this week: UAL, DFS after market close on Wednesday and INTC on Thursday after market close.

        "selftext": "# Ok retards listen up. Been seeing lots of cucks writing small DD pieces of bullish or bearish shit. You cucks need to read this cos this is the whole fucking thing.\n\nthis is also basically my magnum fucking opus so upvote retards. Dont give me awards, legit go buy a powerup membership for a year. Cant tell you to buy shares because we gonna get closed down by Suck Elons Cock somehow.\n\nim also not some fininacial advisor or whatever just read this and make your own conclusions degenerates.\n\nTLDR: GME DD sumarized, Margin doesnt affect longs the same way as shorts right now. Dont buy shares on margin though and get ready to supply collateral regardless. Short interest is up and some smart retards are on our side. Read the post to raise your IQ from 8 to 9 though. **\ud83d\udc3b \ud83c\udf08s  mega fuk and even posting high level bear shit to scare us.**\n\nCompulsory 7 rockets so you autists dont start having a seizure or something:\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nBasically been seeing posts about \"blah blah margin this, short interest this, WS to clever blah\". Going to split this post into distinct sections but im no english degree cuck so dont expect any bear bloomberg  level shit or something\n\n# 1. GME is a fucking steal regardless of squeeze. Buy now or be left on a dying planet while we head to alpha fucking centauri.\n\nSo basically everyone here knows about Ryan cohen and his horsemen of the apocalypse coming to steal melvins lunch money. This man bought apple stock in 2017. Hes fucking rich. Hes also an eccommerce wizard, taking CHEWY from a measly 100k co-founded company to a $4 Billion company in 2017 at which point he sold it to petsmart or something. Its now valued at $40 Billion, granted anything eccommerce now gets money thrown at it like a stripper in a high flying strip club or some shit idk im a virgin so dont listen to me, so it may well be a bubble. Regardless the thing grows its revenue like bacteria doing mitosis on agar jelly \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.\n\nTHEY SELL FUCKING PET FOOD. the market for that is like what? $1?. Gaming is going to the moon and is basically recession proof because of how cheap game is compared to other things for how much you get out of it. Any bears saying that Gamestop cant compete with digital or with amazon. Ryan cohen already slapped amazons head in with a no name brand. Hell fucking do it again. About digital everyone here already knows, microsoft deal, Ryan cohen also mentioned the possibility of having \"Digital game exchanging\" or something, image below.\n\n*Processing img 2ba9j5d2zvb61...*\n\nHe also mentions streaming, digital content etc and aside from all the digital stuff wants GME to move to a community centric structure where big stores operate with VR centres, Internet cafe, table games like Dungeons and dragons and  40k (rapidly growing somehow will boom post covid) and as we now might know due to this post:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme\\_dd\\_buildapc\\_kiosks\\_coming/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme_dd_buildapc_kiosks_coming/)\n\nBUILD YOUR OWN PC KIOSKS. This is the literal smell of money. Go to your Gamestop to build your PC with your kid? Gamestop is already the goto place wher your parents go to get you your latest digital fix so now they can go build PC's and it cant go tits up?\n\n**Now for some pussy boomer talk (aka fundametals or something).**\n\nThe expected Q3 EPS was -0.84$ or something close to that. The actual loss was -0.53$ but boomzoids only talked about the revenue drop. No shit sherlock its closing all its dead weight stores.\n\nIn the holiday report I will talk about a bit more below, 11% of stores were closed and revenue dropped only 3%. Comparitive store sales increased nearly 5%. They cant get enough consoles to sell so expect the momentum to carry on for the whole year I expect. Eccommerce is up 300% over holidays. In Q3 they reported 800% to date. In 2020 Gamestops eccomerce went up 24x. YES YOU READ THAT RIGHT. Online sales now account for \\~33% of Gamestops sales now. This is literally gold dust for ryan cohen.\n\nWe are still trading at 0.38 P/S at this price. The average P/S for the SP500 is 2.753. Massive upside on these two numbers alone.\n\nBurry got in this for the MOASS and the intrinsic value. At the time intrinsic value was like $22 and this will pump up as RC takes it to new heights.\n\nGME in Q3 somehow halved the expected loss. Big Bad Boomer sherman somehow didnt fuck it up that bad by saying \"omnichannel\" at the speed of light. Yes the revenue dropped 30% but thats covid for you. As the PC kiosk post above shows GME now sells small items basically so fast they have to have fake stock lmao. The new console cycle always spikes the share price sky high too, as youll see in a crayon drawing later. The potential revenue that this console cycle brings in could be huge. Biggest ever is potentially a true statement and Gamestop sells every fucker they get. Combine the fact that they share game pass ( a massive hit) revenue from the xboxes they sell, something no other retailer has, revenue could be sky high.\n\nNow I know you autists are starting to develop short term dyslexia or something but keep reading. This could be the most important piece of shit you read in your life. How do you think I feel? My brains overheating just trying to write coherent sentences.\n\nHoldiay report was a bear trap imo, saw people saying the decrease in revenue was bearish blah blah blah. Lies. Comparitve store sales rose 5% and thats with some towns having like 4 gamestops. When the leases dont get renewed and these stores get liquidated (Also in Ryan cohens letter) they can just get this influx of cash and pay down debt and invest in logistics and marketing and new growth. Gamestop realistically needs like 1/2 the stores they have now and just need to improve efficiency. \n\n[https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349890](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349890) this article the messiah himself wrote. In it he states:\n\n&gt;At Chewy, we had maniacal discipline when it came to how we spent money. The company-wide culture of frugality came from his example. Free cash flow was our unwavering governor of growth. We grew Chewy from $200 million in sales in 2013 to $3.5 billion in 2018 while spending only $130 million in capital, all of which went into opening distribution centers across the country and acquiring new customers.\n\nManiacal. Thats all I need to say. The guy is going to get to mars before papa musk and he wont even break a sweat. When FCF starts to catch up to WS expectations every cuck analyst who donwgraded them is gonna get ditched and upgrades will start to happen.\n\nSo in the headin i said its a steal. That implies some future higher price target right? Well here is my guess for a conservative price target based on the information above and also some more I probably forgot cos im a retard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The difference is where share price looks to be and where market cap places us is due to difference in outstanding shares \\(another reason shorts are fuk\\)](https://preview.redd.it/dehiug393wb61.png?width=1552&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f198773c36d5109382eb2beba6fade3c059121df)\n\n&gt;The difference is where share price looks to be and where market cap places us is due to difference in outstanding shares (another reason shorts are fuk)\n\nThis alone means if for not inflation adjusted terms we reached 9.8Bn or whatever the crayon chart says we should reach:\n\n9.8/2.48 = \\~3.95   3.95 \\* $35.5 = \\~$140. The share price now to reach old mkt cap is $140 fucking dollars. Thats a 4 bagger from now. It gets better. \n\nfrom [statista](https://statista.com) :\n\n&gt;Considering the **annual inflation rate in the United States** in recent years, a 2.24 percent **inflation rate** is a very moderate projection.\n\nIf we take 2.24% inflation, the this share price target in todays money means we should reach $182 because of $140 \\* 1.0224\\^12, = $182 in adjusted. Thats more than a 5 bagger. basically we could see $10 GME price from short manipulation and buying more is basically a lottery ticket!\n\nI really dont understand the bear thesis. The only bear thesis ( short term this one) was that margin would affect longs more but I looked at it on ortex and its basically bullshit. Buy shares with cash though dont use margin. Own your piece of GME dont borrow it. Bears just spout \"DigITaL\" or \"BlOCKbuSTER\" so much Ryan tweeted a shit emoji at them. All the bears think theyre clever. What the fuck makes those cucks special? How are they different now than the ones from $2, or $4, or $10. \n\n**Bears are betting against:**\n\nRyan fucking cohen, buisness legend CHEWY from 100k investment, now 40 billion\n\nMichael burry, Investing legend, predicted the housing crisis and is in GME since april\n\nu/DeepFuckingValue , the new WSB god chad, now basically a whale\n\nReggie Fils-Aim\u00e9, gaming and buisness legend, former COO of nintendo\n\nSenvest, a mega fund thats actively managed\n\nNorweigan sovereign wealth fund\n\nFidelity, Vanguard and blackrock own this shit and are never selling they literally dont give a shit\n\nAll of WSB has now formed a shield wall against the bears\n\nMicrosoft gave GME highly discounted azure deals and free office use for all employees and a revenue sharing agreement. Bears are stupid if they think MSFT didnt vet GME.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome valid bear thesis left now (the only ones left) ----&gt; Ryan Cohen dies.\n\n# 2. Now some analysis on the short squeeze and some technical data on puts and calls and ortex data.\n\nOk everyone on here and their cat, dog, bedbugs and wifes boyfriend  knows about the squeeze. Jimmy chill aka cramer even talking about it. Gamestop is literally the most shorted stock of all time and space. The squeeze makes every autist salivate because its basically free money while cucking big money out of like what 1% of their fund.\n\nAlthough I know all you cucks hate shares, and hate holding, if the squeeze doesnt happen selling is probably the most retarded thing anyone could do. Its literally buy high sell low and you fucking disgust me. STONK ONLY GOES UP.\n\nThis squeeze is so monumental that its been sucking sharks in like fresh blood. Most of the funds where shorting this from 30-15 dollars before this year so they didnt really care. It all changed with 2 people. u/DeepFuckingValue and Dr. Michael Burry. These guys are as OG as it gets with GME. I think u/DeepFuckingValue may have even sniffed this trade out before the legend himself. Since then funds will have churned this through their rules and started jumping on this train. Ive been in since $13 with 125 shares. If I had more money Id be buying but im just some stupid student ok. Im merely a medium for this money made information.\n\n**The stats for this stock now short wise are, from ortex:**\n\n*Concrete* short interest as of 31 December 2020: **71 Million**.\n\n*Estimated* short interest, *January 11th data:* (This isnt predicted, this is from data in flow, has margin of error) : **77 Million**\n\nShort shares on loan 7 days ago: **50 Million**\n\nShort shares on loan *now* (This breaks the bearish margin calls affect longs more thesis): 54.2 Million\n\n% of known float short: **147%** as of 31 December 2020\n\n% of know free float on loaned shorts: **108%** as of January 11th.\n\nSome [guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyocql/updated_potential_holdings_of_gme/) on here took into account extra buying on wednesday, Institutions, Burry, RC's extra 7% and WSB ownership (something so stupendously  retarded no serious firm will do it) that float on short could be in the 100s of %. Total short float now I would say could be **200-400%** if the numbers are correct.  This pisses on all other short squeezes. Some countries ban shorting above 100% cos of how autistic it is.\n\nThe recent hike in interactive brokers available shares is probably a mix of sell off on friday (remember  some guys are now buying lambos with GME money. If they held they could by 10), calls exercising and puts being covered and brokers ditching the shares. Nakedshort even reported 5 million naked GME shorts on friday. This is bullish as fuck because the best the shorts could do on a red market day was **-10%**.\n\nGamestop is still on the SECs threshold list for 27 days now.\n\n*Processing img xsetax08pwb61...*\n\nNeed rockets \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80:\n\nOk so now if WSB owns an estimated 6-8% of the stock and we all know to move over to cash accounts now to avoid margin calls, we should be minimizing longs getting margin called. Every bear on stockwits is a clueless cuck who spouts \"blockbuster\" and these guys dont even know what margin even is so my bet is the colossal **54 Million** shares short on loan are gonna be affected by the margin calls more. Why? Because every long on margin is in the green, and now a true zealot/extremist/autist for ryan cohen so will supply their account with collateral to avoid margin call. Shorts are in the massive red zone. How do I know you ask?\n\nOrtex data from Jan 4th 2021:\n\n*Processing img urqb3c3zbwb61...*\n\nSo this shows for jan 4th the estimated short interest is 66.98 Million shares. From the exchange reported 71 Million on december 31st this makes a lot of sense because the share price fell from \\~21 to \\~17 so shorts took profits. The shares on loan arent for longs too. This is all purely short data, and 47M  shorted at $17 this shows.\n\nThese shorts are in a circle of hell we cant comprehend and makes satan scared.\n\nNow for the data for this week:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Ortex short data for Jan 14th for Gamestop](https://preview.redd.it/5ryumpl1dwb61.png?width=1152&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb80c09e1be7b2f36f6d3745983cef4ce2b2df9b)\n\nSHARES ON LOAN HAVE GONE UP.  BUT 87% OF LOANED SHORTS WHERE SHORTING AT SUB $20. \n\nCost to borrow is also up, estimated short interest is up to a cataclysmic amount.\n\nLongs on margin need to supply collateral, but we are in the massive green zone, shorts are underwater. Margin calls will ravage the shorts and sting the longs. We also have the uptick rule in place until the end of the day, so shorts can only short on the way up. Im not saying itll happen but this shit is skewed in our favour big time. we need to \ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/).\n\n**Seen a lot of talk about Gamma hedging and delta.**\n\nYou realize that the fucking bankers and brokers dont understand gamma hedging right? That shits up their with the black-scholes equation and feynman-kac solution. Forget about it. The retards claiming to understand it are either payed by hedge funds or lose money. The guy who took out outs thinking options exercising and gamma hedging would lead to a collossal sell off on friday lost money on his puts because **no one** except some quants in a goldman sachs server room know this shit. The idea is simple about neutral delta on options that people take out, but the simple system interacts with every other thing in the stock market, and wow who couldve guessed it, like nearly any other element of the stock market predicting something by the day is nigh impossible. That guy talking about Gamma , Delta and margin calls is on weeklies. Hes no more autistic and equally retarded as all of us. Hes a chill guy though so dont berate a fellow brother.\n\n**Now weve established the likelihood of longs getting margin called is far smaller than shorts, on to the options distributions**\n\n**Two images now: Top one is before the end of the 15th, the other one is after market close:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img t8odq9btgwb61...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 3nqb33f0hwb61...*\n\nThese two graphs, show before market close and after. As we can see the massiver 51000 put contracts didnt get rolled over and the chances that those were melvins july puts rolled up is very high. They expired worthless. Lots of calls are printing big time while huge amounts of puts are worthless and bleeding money.\n\nSomething else we can extrapolate from the charts is that massive options trades are not present on the scale we saw before (tens of thousands).\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \n\nWe are seeing a discrepancy in the number of puts/calls opening up at the higher prices with calls gaining fast. This could show that some funds are now becoming optimistic on the long or short term prospects of gamestop. There are also more puts than options and if we assume this for shorts vs longs on margin (without even taking into account that all shorts are borrowed shares and pay interest further bleeding cash) then shorts are likely on more margin than longs.\n\nRegardless fellow autists my main point is two show that the bears are underwater and the bulls are flying high with regards to options.\n\n**Now lets compare this possible squeeze with others.**\n\nBear in mind this is the most shorted stock of all time, but differences in free float change the share price differently.\n\nKodak went from **$2.16 to $33.2**\n\nVolkswagen went from **\\~200 euro to nearly 1000.**\n\nOverstock went from **\\~$21 to $123**\n\nBlue apron went from **$2.31 to $18** \n\nIve been seeing some estimated that 1 million shares is roughly a dollars move in share price. This maths is about to be pretty autistic so bear with me degnerates.\n\n$1 now is 2.81% of the share price. Everything in the markets is exponential and based on percentages. So if we assume a full squeeze of ortexs estimated short interest (This assumes no sell off and no new shorts, new shorts can be positive or negative depedning on when in the squeeze they happen) **$35.5 \\* 1.0281\\^77 = $299.** GME to moon. \ud83c\udf11 .\n\nThis shit can happen. Hold on.\n\n**GME has squeezed and been manipulated before and it always happens around the console cycles. Shorts never win and they wont win now.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 4ysv7bzclwb61...*\n\nBasically the crayon chart shows green (outstanding shares) orange ( short shares) purple (Market cap) and cyan (Share price). In 2006-2008 the share price rose in tandem with short interest ( Like now ) Until console releases when you can see an abrupt squeeze happend mooning the share price. \n\nThis happend to a degree in 2013 with the xbox one but worse conditions for the company and a worse console launch lead to slow short covering but the share price still mooned.\n\nNow we get to the best part. History is repeating itself for the third time and the shares sold short are literally higher than the outstanding shares, which have been decreasing since 2010. Short shares are also at the highest point ever and GME hasnt had a brighter future, well ever. Ps5 and Xbox Series X. are the two most hyped consoles since the Ps2. This is setting up the foundations for massive price movements weve never seen before. This shit has literally never happend, ever. Uncharted waters and we are the captain.\n\n**For the insurmountably retarded autists who think that the squeeze has happend look upon this and despair:**\n\n[**https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwpf6k/gme\\_gang\\_there\\_hasnt\\_been\\_a\\_short\\_squeeze\\_yet/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwpf6k/gme_gang_there_hasnt_been_a_short_squeeze_yet/)\n\nIHOR IS A MEGA WIZARD\n\nIhor I quote:\n\n&gt;**A long-buying tsunami ... is the primary factor for the price move**\n\nIhor Dusaniwsky is managing director of predictive analytics at S3 a firm similar to ortex. He told bloomberg that the squeeze hasnt happend yet and that this was long buying. If someone knows this shit its him. He was talking about the tesla squeeze in january 2020. He has access to resources we can only imagine. Barrons cut his comment that the squeeze hasnt happend yet out it was that fucking bullish. All the media ramming down \"Short squeeze has happend\" down peoples throats because bears are fucking scared.\n\nThe bots on stocktwits spamming bearish sentiment should show how rattled they are.\n\n**Conclusion: Buy shares with cash not margin. Hold shares forever unless RC dies (Shame hes a cybernetic demigod), Melvin bad, Shorts fuk, \ud83d\udc3b \ud83c\udf08  posting bearish shit are doing weeklies for the second time after they expired red on friday, GME to $200 without squeeze, Ryan cohen a god, GME is still a value play, Good luck have fun.**",

        "selftext": "Good afternoon\n\nThe current market has some obvious similarities with the internet bubble in the 2000s at the moment:\n\n1) Sectoral bubble\n\nElectric Vehicle stocks, Renewable energy stocks, crypto and possibly even fintech stocks have skyrocketed to insane levels in 2020. A PE ratio of 100-200 for stocks in these sectors is considered \"cheap\" right now, that's what \"investors\" before the dotcom crash thought aswell.\n\n2) Historic low interest rates\n\nThis is the biggest catalyst for the creation of an insane bubble, very low interest rates. Just like in the 2000s, we currently have historic low interest rates, which makes stocks the only game in town. The big myth here is that people think stocks only go up, with interest rates close to 0. That's absolutely not true and that's the scary part in my opinion, because even professionals and analysts think that. The market doesn't stay disconnected from the economy forever.\n\n3) IPO mania and speculation\n\nWe haven't seen more IPO's in 2020 since the dotcom bubble. This on itself isn't a big deal, but the valuations these IPO's get are beyond insanity. Any company that gets linked to EV in some way, automatically gets a 100%+ boost to their stock price, without even having a product or sales number. 1999 all over again?\n\n4) \"New paradigm\"\n\nLet's be honest, at least 80% of the people in any financial subreddit (excluding WSB, +-99% there) thinks that Tesla is the new paradigm that will take over the world. Trust me, it is not. I've been doing some math on Tesla valuation, and I have no fitting word for its current valuation. I won't go in the details why, because I could write a whole book about this. I still firmly believe that growing positive cashflows should be the main catalyst of a stock that goes up, and a company with a negative cashflow (THAT ONLY GROWS AT A 25% RATE) shouldn't get a 1t valuation, that's too disrespectful for companies such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple. \n\n6) Greed and FOMO\n\nEveryone wants to jump on this train, no one wants to miss out, but I can assure you, these valuations are absurd and those who can't get out early enough, will be left holding the (empty) bag.\n\nKind regards and stay safe (physically and financially)",

        "selftext": "Tesla stock went up almost 700% this year because Wedbush (who\u2019s made an absolute fortune getting people to buy into his narrative) got retail investors to buy into the narrative that Tesla is not an automotive company, despite over 90% of its revenue coming from selling cars. Once the narrative stuck that it\u2019s a \u201ctech\u201d company, BAM, valuation goes up $550B. And please don\u2019t be an autist and say something retarded like \u201cif Tesla is a car company then Apple is a phone company\u201d. Yes, over 50% of apples revenue is from phones, but they also have huge revenue segments in Mac, IPad, Audio, Services, etc. So, if Apples revenue was 90% phones then yes that statement would be true, buts it\u2019s not so please don\u2019t try and justify it with that stupid brainwashing comment (which I know someone will post in the comments and get 1k upvotes). \n\nNow, Tesla is a phenomenal company with a visionary leader, don\u2019t get me wrong - but they are being priced like the next Amazon. One slip up and they will tumble - or if they can\u2019t find that one thing that will essentially print money for them (Apple iPhone, Google ads, Microsoft Azure, Amazon web services), then valuation will get cut in half. The first 6x months will be about value stocks, and I predict Tesla hits $500 before it hits $900. I think this year makes millionaires first from Tesla puts, then calls in the second half of the year. \n\nThe only thing I can think of that makes this not happen is the amount of cash they have on hand from selling more shares. That amount of money is dangerous in the hands of Elon. But let\u2019s see what happens - I think puts are the way to go early on, could net some new millionaires.",

        "selftext": "I'll admit it. All this Blackberry pump got me hyped and I want to get some action too. BB has potential to moon, but I think a lot of you will still manage to lose money, because you are picking wrong strategies.\n\n**The problem**\n\nI know this sub is obsessed with short term OTM calls. However by buying these you are doing no justice to yourself and this community.\n\nLet me explain. Have you ever wondered who sells you these calls? I'll tell you. Big guys and by big guys I'm talking billion dollar financial institutions that we call **market makers**. Market maker does not care which stock, what strike, how many \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 we put here - all they care about is to **make money by selling you calls.**\n\nMarket makers are very good at managing risk. Whenever they sell calls, they make sure they have the underlying stock. That way, they essentially sell **covered calls** instead of **naked calls**.\n\nWhen you look at the option table, you will notice a column called **Open Interest**. It basically tells you have many option contracts are out there in the wild. Think about this as a number of retards holding these in their Robinhood account, hoping to get rich quickly.\n\nMarket makers love when there is a big hype around certain stock, especially certain strike and date. They sell these calls to you retards, and all they have to do as the expiration date nears is make sure **the stock stays below the most popular strike**, aka **strike with the most open interest**.\n\nWhy would they do that? Because they **make free money** by selling you these worthless gambling short term tickets.\n\nHow would they do this? By shorting the stock. Remember they are so big that they can afford to short the stock and suppress the price of the stock **in the short term** just in time for **your short term calls to expire worthless**.\n\nI know some of you geniuses will tell me that market makers can't manipulate the stock in the short term; sure keep telling yourself that while you ride in your 2010 Toyota Corolla.\n\n**You are easy targets**\n\nOver 11,000 of you idiots, bought $12 February calls. Don't believe me? Check it yourself: [https://twitter.com/silberschmelzer/status/1350903153433128967/photo/1](https://twitter.com/silberschmelzer/status/1350903153433128967/photo/1)\n\nAll market makers have to do now, is make sure BB does not moon past $12 by February 19 and they are set. You lost your stimulus check money and have no means to play again.\n\nMarch is even worse: [https://twitter.com/silberschmelzer/status/1350910637451468801/photo/1](https://twitter.com/silberschmelzer/status/1350910637451468801/photo/1). All of you piling into $15 strikes. Why are you making yourself easy targets? You are disclosing your strike and your date! What if BB moons in April? Can you sustain wasting money on these monthly calls with your minimum wage jobs?\n\n**The solution**\n\nBuy shares. They do not expire. There is no pressure to be right. You want to be on the \ud83d\ude80 when it starts taking off, instead of being broke on the ground.\n\nWith worthless calls, no one will like you - even this sub will make funny of you.\n\nBelieve me. I've been here long enough to remember MSFT 03/21/2020 C $200 and PLTR 12/31/2020 C $30.\n\n**TL;DR**  \nBuy BB shares, not short term OTM calls.",

Pure majestic autism. \n\nI come out of Plato\u2019s cave to tell you I understand your pains. I was there not too long ago... you see... \n\nBack in November I noticed $BB cleanly up-trending on the hourly bouncing off the 9 and 26 MA (I use ichimoku) heading towards a resistance level that had already formed a double top \n\nLike a true Gamblers fallacy believing retard I made a wager: \n\n$10k into $6 calls expiring March on the DD that: \u201cwhat are the chances it falls AGAIN there\u201d ... that\u2019s it. \n\nA few days later AWS news came, and that $10k turned into $70k. Pure luck. Sometimes she goes, sometimes she doesn\u2019t. She went that day.\n\nIn that moment of seeing massive profits on AWS news day, I experienced violent and absolutely tremendous autism and thought, this thing is going from $5\u2019s to $15 in a single trading session, yes, even more retarded than you guys that bought the top on Friday \n\nSensible thoughts couldn\u2019t penetrate my helmet fast enough as drool gushed from my gaping mouth, gasping for oxygen and yelling at the top of my lungs what barely resembled words about Lambo\u2019s and Yachts... so I hurled about $100k into shares at $8.77 and about $10k more into $15 leaps \n\nI proceeded to watch my profit dwindle to nothing as earnings came and bent me over so hard I couldn\u2019t bring myself to watch the stock for a week \n\nI thought about selling the bottom, I was there, order ready typed, just needed to hit the send button, and I was going to close my position around $6.7ish and be back to break even after striking gold \n\nBut you know what, I remembered it\u2019s just money. I remembered that everything in reality is in flux, and changing, and decaying, and being born again, and to just flow with it and stop clinging and desiring one set of experiences over another (aka a fat bank account over giving $5 blowies behind a Wendy\u2019s) who cares? \n\nAll is well lads. So let go of the burden if you bought the top and are stressing, it\u2019s really fine. Look at what\u2019s happening right now:\n\n1) Insane volume, insane moves, erratic behavior (something is going on behind the curtain) \n\nPS: this movement and volume is NOT because of WSB, full stop. Big players are making huge moves here, and fast, we don\u2019t know why yet \n\n2) 1 Billion annual revenue \n3) Soon to come online a RECURRING AUTO DATA business that will drive revenue into growth cycle, BB is literally Microsoft Windows for cars but the auto sector was still underdeveloped technologically to benefit from this position, hence this vertical is finally about to print HUGE HUGE HUGE MEGA BILLIONS ANNUAL. This was always the plan and they just had to wait it out until the auto sector caught up with them digitally \n\n(The auto data tech sector is so lucrative it made Papa Elon the richest person in the world, and forced a fucking god damn phone company to join the race \ud83c\udf4e\u2014it\u2019s huge)\n\n4) UNDER, FUCKING, VALUED \n5) VERTICALS GALORE\n5) FB settled, imagine the BALLS on BB going after this massive and dirty tech behemoth run by a literal lizard, they are honest Canadians doing God\u2019s work \n6) IOT, AI, smart city\u2019s, insert other buzzwords \n\nI could go on and on, and honestly, I\u2019ve never felt more comfortable holding ANY stock than this \n\nMoral of the story: as I let go and accepted my circumstances and decided to diamond hand \ud83d\udc8e \ud83e\udd1a BB to the death, within a few days I proceeded to watch the fattest, thickest, randomest, greenest dildo penetrate my butt hole to the high heavens and take me from what was $70k profit to 0 profit back up to $130k profit. I\u2019ve trimmed half the options, I don\u2019t even know why tbh, reverse autism maybe, but I\u2019m riding my remaining calls and entire share position to Valhalla. \n\nWill likely add more if it dips. But...\n\nJust hold. Something is cooking on BB. You have to be a retard not to see it. Look at the fucking daily chart, look at the volume, the gaps, the swings, BB chart literally has Tourette\u2019s syndrome right now... \n\nThis stock has not moved like this for 10 years. \n\nIt might stall a little, deflate from here, consolidate a bit more, or it might blast off again any second. Point is, nobody knows when, but it looks like in a short time, we will know why this stock is moving the way it has. Something is DEFINITELY going on behind the scenes the public is not aware of and neither is the media \n\nFor fucks sake I found the court docs showing global settlement with FB is done 24 hours before gay ass Bloomberg even picked it up. The majority of the investor world still thinks they make fucking phones for Gods sake. Everyone is sleeping on this \n\nA note on Jim just in case he reads this:\n\nJim Cramer hates this stock because 1) BB and John Chen are not bootlicking CEO\u2019s jerking off CNBC and massaging Cramers asshole for air time, they\u2019re a tightly run, honorable company doing real things 2) He most likely became a bag holder during the epic fall of the BB phone and sold for a fat loss and wants to protect his ego by continuing to ignore the facts on the company\n\nThe guy wants you to invest in CRWD with a fucking ridiculous market cap, no verticals, and less revenue than BB. Promoting a literal bubble over a value play. What a bizarre world we live in. Take advantage of it, I hear this phrase all the time and I fucking hate it, but this is literally \u201cfree money\u201d \n\nKnow what you own. There is TRUE value in this company. No hype. Pure value. \n\nDiamond hand, double down, buy more, and just hold. You are in good hands \ud83d\ude4c\n\nTl;dr diamond hand $BB",

        "selftext": "I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page, regardless of the subreddit, then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.\n\n**How is \"Hype\" calculated?**\n\nWell, this is a little tricky but it's based on the engagement that the post received in that sub-reddit relative to other posts in the same sub-reddit\n\n**How can I use this list?**\n\nThe best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits.

        "selftext": "Obviously if you own an index fund you don't have to make this decision, more power to you. For those preferring a more concentrated portfolio style, I think this is an interesting question - because these are all great companies, but naturally one must be better than the others.\n\nIf you had to pick just one of the mega-caps, which do you buy today?\n\nMy personal thoughts:\n\n- Facebook. I see potential competition to their network, but the balance sheet is a fortress and valuation has been pushed down a bit due to general public hatred. A contrarian pick. (B)\n\n- Apple. In my opinion the valuation of this has run away farther ahead of its earnings relative to the others, making it the least attractive of the bunch for me. (C-)\n\n- Amazon. Doing amazing things, looking at the last several quarters their earnings seem to be accelerating - however the p/e is higher than all the rest. (A-)\n\n- Microsoft. The sleeper choice, solid valuation in addition to growth. Not flashy but a money printer. (A)\n\n- Google. My perception is that they're slipping - taking lots of high risk/high payoff bets that don't appear to be paying off yet. Feels potentially contrarian but I'm not wildly excited. (C)?\n\n- Bonus: Mastercard/Visa. Secular trend away from cash makes these seem like long term great picks, in spite of fin-tech disruptors. Not cheap valuations though. I favor MA over V for efficient use of capital. (B+)\n\nJust my opinions of course. Your thoughts?",

        "selftext": "**BB is king.**\n\nbefore anything, this is not financial advice, go fuck yourself you autists. I am a degenerate with a hypothesis. Now that that disclaimer is done\n\nMan blackberry, who the hell thought I\u2019d be investing in you after the fall of BBM and Brickbreaker. Well, strap in folks as I take you through one of the most bullish stories in stonk history, and it all starts with one statement. Everything you\u2019re thinking about with Blackberry at the moment, is wrong.\n\nIt is not a phone company. It is not telling you to use BBM. It is a software, automotive, and cybersecurity company that is about to make a killing. Let\u2019s begin:\n\nBB stock price, 6.71 as of Close on 1-6-2021. \n\nTechnically, this thing is a fucking beauty. MACD flip, Stoch RSI cross, volume died on the sells and the thing is pushing up just the market died twice while it had solid momentum. This is going to move soon, but let's go away from crayons and into the magical land of make believe, news events, conferences, and fundamentals. It's not just two letters, it's a business. https://www.tradingview.com/x/uI3Cl51F/ \n\n**Recent Earnings**\n\nFiscal Quarter End| Date Reported| Earnings Per Share* | Consensus EPS* Forecast| % Surprise\n---|---|----|----|----\nNov 2020| 12/17/2020| 0.1 | -0.04| 100\nAug 2020| 09/24/2020| 0.1| -0.02| 600\nMay 2020| 06/24/2020| 0| -0.04| 100\nFeb 2020| 03/31/2020| 0.06| 0.01| 500\n\n\n\nSurprises along the board.\n\n* Revenues last quarter, $224 MM.\n* Revenues projected for Q4, $246 MM.\n* Full year Guidance 2021, $950 MM. \n* Mkt cap, $4 B. \nTotal company non-GAAP revenue of $224 million; total company GAAP revenue of $218 million. Non-GAAP earnings per basic and diluted share of $0.02; GAAP loss per basic and diluted share of $0.23. Net cash generated from operating activities of $29 million.\n\n\n\nSaw this cute image of CRWD PLTR and SNOW, all with similar or lower Revs but SNOW is half but worth 20x BB, CRWD has less revs but is operating at 11.75x, PLTR (WSB fav) has 50M more projected annual revs and is worth 11x. Alright who cares about revenue, that's only today. If only it accounted for the big event happening in the next 9 days (see news events below).\n\n**NEWS EVENTS**\n\n*FB settlement*\n\nI\u2019m not going to go into deep detail here as it is quite intricate and all I know is that BB won a suit against fuckerberg $FB related to messaging, whatsapp, and something else. $FB has till January 15th, 2020 to settle, see here: https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.331602/gov.uscourts.cand.331602.144.0.pdf \n\nThis FB settlement is not included in earnings expectations, meaning THAT SHIT GOES UP or will be in analyst projections.\n\n*BlackBerry IVY - Intellectual Vehicle Data Platform*\n\nThe big kahuna that will change BB for the next few years. Per BB website: \u201cBlackBerry and AWS are joining forces to develop BlackBerry IVY, a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences and improve operations of connected vehicles with new BlackBerry QNX and AWS technology.\u201d\n\nWhat does it mean to the end consumer (the automakers?)\n\n**IVY Fueling Business Outcomes**\n\nBlackBerry IVY will help automakers and automotive suppliers:\n\nFuel Innovation by supporting rapid development of new customer experiences\nDrive Revenue by unlocking new revenue streams and business models\nReduce Costs by moving processing to the edge &amp; reducing raw data transmission\nImprove Operations with enhanced data visibility and access\nExpand Ecosystems by unlocking the broader app developer community\n\n\nWanna watch a video? [bideo here](https://youtu.be/fwDnUNENSoY) \n\nWant a TL;DR? Automotive, cloud, cybersecurity, IOT, electric vehicles, every bubble on the planet. And this shit got all of it. Want more info? https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/aws Read this and watch their conferences coming up.\n\n**Partnerships with big companies**\n\nBlackberry partnered with Zoom (link: https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/10/blackberry-and-zoom-together-secure-your-virtual-enterprise-meetings), Microsoft Teams (link: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-athoc-integrates-with-microsoft-teams-for-critical-event-management-301147559.html) and some other company that I forgot. Cybersecurity adding onto big big platforms that exploded this past year. MORE MONEY you dumbasses.\n\nPatents\nBB started offloading old patents but have one that will be important as of recent, with the sexiest one being this: https://uspto.report/patent/grant/10880812 \n\nVery pretty stuff, big sex.\n\n\n**Business Implications**\n\nBB makes their money from licensing, cybersecurity (one of the only companies that have not been hacked in this SolarWind shit), BB QNX is already in 175 MM cars worldwide, partnered with XPEV, and is in talks with multiple Tier 1 automakers, 20 different OEMs, and will be in vehicles by 2023. Does that mean anything now? Yes, you dumbass. Per CEO John Chen, my new president, #DidYouKnow @BlackBerry has been selected by 19 of the top 25 #ElectricVehicle manufacturers, and they represent 61% of the Electric Vehicle market?\n\nBubblicious and sexy. Expect some of the big tier 1s like Nissan, Toyota, BMW, and others to jump on this train. Think TSLA doesn\u2019t have competition? Bitch they cant even make a billion dollars unless they sell stock (which since MS just upgraded their price, I bet they offer at least $5B in stock in the coming days).\n\n**CONFERENCES**  \n\nBB is speaking at the following conferences:\n\nCiti\u2019s 2021 Global TMT West Virtual Conference - Thursday January 7th, 2021 at 1 PM with the Steve Rai, Blackberry CFO  and John Wall, Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions (BTS) \n\nJP Morgan 19th Annual Tech / Auto Forum\nTuesday January 12th, 2021 at 5:45 PM ET \nwith the Steve Rai, Blackberry CFO  and John Wall, Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions (BTS) \n\nNeedham\u2019s 23rd Annual Virtual Growth Conference \nFriday, January 15th, 2021 at 1:15 pm ET \nWith Ryan Permeh, Blackberry Chief Security Architect &amp; Co-founder of Cylance and Eric Cornelius, Blackberry Chief Product Architect \n\nThis was just announced and you bet your ass this will pump this stock up.\n\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis stock will generate a lot more cash in the coming years, will gain in the short term by offloading old patents, settling with FB and getting some moolah, growing in their partnership with Bezos gang, roll out to more EVs with Tier 1 and Tier 2 automotive companies, and compete with Tesla on this as well. This shit trades at $6.70 and is so close to going up if the market just doesn\u2019t crash in the interim. They already are used by big companies for Access and other Mobile applications, so that someone can securely use their dinky iPhone to work. Think big whales aren\u2019t interested? Look at 2022 2023 option OI. \n\nI think this goes to lower PT of $10 by May, more likely $15. uThInKitWiLLdOUbleINmKTcAp???? Yes you fucking idiot, this is trading at 4X sales only, will be profitable this year, and has so much shit coming up. This is UNDER 4B!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just buy the stock and sit on it. Want options? Buy them too. Have fun guys, I hope you all make money.\n\nMy positions:\n\n29 contracts Feb $7C, bought as recently as yesterday.\n1300 Shares, price avg of $7.001. I could have actively traded this prior to ER but decided to long term hold cause I am not a daytrader, and I fully believe in this hypothesis. I wouldn\u2019t be typing this shit if not.

        "selftext": "Okay listen up autists. I have seen a lot doom and gloom about GME lately, speculation about poor holiday sales, complaints about the short squeeze not happening, shortages in supply for the new consoles and even some \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b treading out in the open. So let me clarify to you retards some ignored reasons why GME is going to the moon \ud83c\udf1a \n\nLet's start out with a common misconception which I have seen debunked a few times but still seems to linger. It seems that a lot of you retards just look at the chart of the stock price and think that Gamestops all time high was in the low 60-ies or high 50-ies. WRONG. Ok technically, this is true, but it is not important. The all time high for Gamestop stock was 63 dollars per share back in 2007. The problem is that Gamestop had a lot more shares back then. The all time high for the market cap of Gamestop is $9.86 billion. *The current market cap is $1.15 billion.* That means that if Gamestop grew just to the same size it was before with RCs new vision for the company, the stock would increase **8.6 times to $150(\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80).** \n\nNot only is the all time high probably a lot higher than some of you thought, the market for gaming has grown significantly since then and it is still growing. The gaming market has increased 2.5 times in size since 2007 and keeps growing each year. Gamestop is also shifting its business from just selling games to selling very high margin items like collectibles, PC parts and gaming equipment and signing deals for online sales with Microsoft. Additionally, e-commerce companies, especially ones in large and growing industries, are generally valued a lot higher than brick and mortar shops. That means that reaching the same size as old Gamestop did might entail a greater stock price.\n\nOk so we have established that there is a lot of potential for GME stock and for some of you autists that's enough to throw your life savings into it. But I can already see my future DMs filled with [\ud83c\udf08](https://emojipedia.org/rainbow/)\ud83d\udc3b saying that the potential doesn't matter because gAmEsToP iS tHe NeW bLoCkBuStEr and they are going to either go bankrupt or get smaller and smaller over time until they aren't relevant anymore. So lets make clear what the vision for Gamestop's future is. By which I mean what certified genius Ryan Cohen wants for its future. Cohen's vision can be summarized as a transition from a brick and mortar shop to an e-commerce giant competing with Amazon. He is famously obsessed with customer service and wants to make Gamestop the 1 stop for all things gaming. Imagine a slick website where you can buy everything related to gaming: gaming PC parts, gaming collectibles, etc. Add in 24/7 customer service provided by people knowledgeable about the products Gamestop will be selling. As well as fast shipping with a whopping $0 delivery fee because there are thousands of Gamestops all over the US where you can pick up your order. All these things were hallmarks Cohens previous company and in articles like [this one](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanverdon/2020/01/26/ryan-cohen-started-a-company-that-took-on-amazon-and-sold-it-for-3-billion-now-hes-thinking-about-whats-next/?sh=655bf7165579) where he talks excessively about the importance of providing those features in an e-commerce environment. \n\nTo finish off I would like to show you just how dedicated Cohen seems to be to making Gamestop an e-commerce giant. The article I linked above is from January 2020, about 6 months before Cohen made his first investment into Gamestop and is titled \u201cRyan Cohen Started A Company That Took On Amazon, And Sold It For $3 Billion. Now He\u2019s Thinking About What\u2019s Next\u201d. In the article Cohen says that he is still looking for ways to compete with Amazon and that he thinks they have \u201cChinks in their armor\u201d that he seems to want to expose. What I found the most interesting though was the following excerpt: \n\n&gt;*right now he is trying to figure out what the next \u201csomething\u201d will be for him. \u201cI look at almost everything that comes to me, but I say no to 99.9% of it. \\[...\\] As Warren Buffet says, the difference between successful and really successful people is really successful people say no all the time.\u201d.*\n\n That means that after more than 2 years of searching and looking at different opportunities he decided that Gamestop was the basket he wanted to put all his eggs in. In another article he said \u201cI relished the challenges of disrupting an entire industry and trying to delight customers to a degree that had never been achieved before.\u201d and he has also said in yet another article when asked about the opportunities he sees for himself in the future \"I've been an entrepreneur since my early teens and certainly haven't peaked at age 34!\" \n\nSo genius Ryan Cohen is putting all his eggs into Gamestop, which we have established has insane upward potential,  after more than 2 years of rejecting probably thousands of good opportunities and wants to disrupt an entire industry and clash with Amazon again. Do you really think the \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bs over at Melvin Capital are going to be able to stop him? If not you better tank up on GME shares now that the share price is low or after the potential short term crash following the ICR conference.\n\nPositions: Yolo on GME shares with a target price of $400 to sell \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nPS: For all you illiterate retards out there here is a TLDR in Emojis: \n\nGME \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1a , \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b\ud83d\udd2b, \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c = \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0",

        "selftext": "So far I'm going with Jeff Bezos' investing philosophy he outlined in one of his interviews. To just pick a bunch of high risk, high reward long term opportunities, and invest in all of them. If any one or multiple of them pan out, then it'll easily make up for the losers.\n\nSo far I've decided to just completely ignored index funds. Instead I'm just DCAing into whatever I find has huge long term potential based off of what reddit, youtube, motley fool or ARK has hyped up. 80% of my portfolio is in BTC, ETH, TSLA, SQ, LMND, DKNG, uranium stocks, and ARK ETFs.  I'm planning on adding solar and marijuana ETFs.\n\nI've also decided not to sell a single stock no matter what happens, until I have enough to just put everything on VT/VTI and live off of that.\n\nHas anyone else pursued this strategy for the past 4-5 years? If so how did it pan out? When I look at old posts from 2-3 years ago it seems that AMD, MSFT and NVDA were the ones that were hyped up.

        "selftext": "I saw u/Unlucky-Prize post about the technical factors for $GME and felt inspired to make a post about the reasons why I\u2018m long this stock, which is the fundamentals.  I don\u2019t do options or techincal analysis so please refer to other posts for that info.\n\n$GME had been on my radar for quite some time but I finally dipped my toes in two weeks ago.  The basis for that wasn\u2019t the potential for a short squeeze or short interest but the underlying fundamentals behind $GME.  I had posted a long comment in a previous thread and will expand on that to explain why I\u2019m bullish long term for $GME.  I hope this helps.  This post is meant to be a personal opinion and not advice to buy or sell Gamestop.\n\n\ud83d\udc3b Case: \n\n1.  Digital sales will make Gamestop the next Blockbuster.  \n\nThe digital game sales argument, like all \ud83d\udc3b  arguments, are weak.  The shift to digital will possibly occur in the next console cycle.  So maybe the \ud83d\udc3b are right, but they\u2019re right in 8 years which means they\u2019re wrong now.  Additionally digital sales growth has decelerated and are returning to pre-covid levels as more\npeople go back to stores.  This trend should continue if the pandemic improves.  Additionally game publishers don\u2019t care about the fractionally\nlarger margins from selling digital direct.  They only care about moving as many units as quickly as possible.  If they could sell the games on floppy disks they would.  Go read the public filings for any game publisher and they will tell you that they only care about selling what customers want and guess what, they still want physical. \n\nBlockbuster died because Carl Icahn got involved, killed Blockbuster\u2019s attempt to pivot to a Netflix model by offering an online rental service and Blockbuster\u2019s old business model relied on late fees.  Icahn insisted that Blockbuster's greatest asset was its physical location and late fees, killed the pivot and forced them to triple down on their old strategy.  Carl ended up losing 98% of his investment in Blockbuster.  There continues to be demand for physical movie rentals as evidenced by Red Box locations and Netflix still has a few million dvd by mail subscribers.\n\nGamestop has also recently started to pivot away from software sales into other areas and now software sales now make up large minority of Gamestop's total sales.  They're pivoting more towards physical goods and not just Funko Pops but also plan to expand more into new areas like PC gaming and hardware.  \n\nEveryone knows that they signed a revenue agreement with Microsoft where Gamestop will get a cut of the lifetime revenue from Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.  This shouldn't sour the relationship with Sony or Nintendo.  If anything, Sony and Nintendo should be compelled to offer a similar revenue share agreement because Gamestop will inevitably push Microsoft products if Gamestop stand to profit more from it.  This will be a bigger deal in later years as console availability increases and consumers actually deciding to cross shop consoles as opposed to getting whichever new one is available right now.  Sony and Nintendo won't stop selling products through Gamestop because of this agreement with Microsoft, it's too large of a sales channel to give up.\n\n2.  Gamestop will go bankrupt\n\nThis is highly unlikely to happen.  Gamestop managed to survive the single worst brick and mortar retail sales environment in modern history and ended the year with a cash surplus of a few hundred million.  Now its the new year and the beginning of a new console cycle.  This console cycle should last as long as the previous ones which is close to a decade, plus or minus a few years.  During that time, they will be printing money hand over fist selling consoles, new games, used games, accessories, protection plans, etc.\n\n3.  Brick and mortar retail is dead.  Gamestop locations are shutting down left and right, this must mean they're going bankrupt.\n\nGamestop's average lease durations are actually quite short.  A lot of brick and mortar shops have lease duration lasting a decade but the average lease duration for Gamestop is just 2-4 years.  This allows them to close underperforming stores and open new ones very quickly.\n\nGamestop's saw e-commerce grow by 250% last quarter.  The company has been and continues to pivot towards a \"digital-first, omni-channel ecosystem for games and entertainment\"\n\n\ud83d\udc02 Case\n\nThis MOASS could be long and protracted like Tesla in all of 2020 as many continue to bet against Gamestop, instead of a sharp spike like Volkswagen, where Porsche played a large role in spiking the share price.  Keep in mind that at 1x sales, the share price should be $80-100.  Compare that with another retailer Chewy, which has a p/s of 6-7x.  Pet products also has a much lower TAM than gaming.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t even factoring in a complete turnaround that RC has to be planning.  Look at the newest board composition.  Newest members are Reggie (my body is ready), the head of cloud 9 esports, and the current president Petsmart and Chewy. board member.  Ask yourself, are these the people that would join the board of a company that is expected to die in 5 years due to digital game sales.  \n\nThis has moved beyond a short squeeze yolo to a long term hold.  If RC succeeds in transforming this into the next Chewy, you\u2019re looking at a 20x multiple.  This is based on fundamentals and industry tailwinds.  I added 10k shares weeks ago and added 20k shares at $38 because this thing is going much higher and idgaf about a few bucks in share price right now.  Also don\u2019t attempt to time the market because you could be left behind at the launchpad.  \n\nSimply put, if I told you there was a business that served a $200 billion total addressable market with very discerning and loyal customers with a lot of disposable income to spend on this market.  They have over 5,000 retail locations all across the world.  Last quarter, they saw Ecommerce grow by nearly 300% and ended a year where many other brick and mortar retailers went bankrupt with hundreds of millions of dollars in extra cash.  This company has a database called PowerUp consisting of tens of millions of customers that pay them a yearly premium membership.  They're starting a multiyear pivot into several new growing areas and have new board members that are industry leaders in each of those respective areas at the start of a new product launch cycle that will last a decade.  A young visionary founder who made his billions by creating a customer centric experience that defeated Amazon, who is well known to focus on one idea to the point of obsession, just became this company's largest shareholder and now controls the board.  I tell you this company trades at .5 sales.  Would you short or long this company?\n\n\nTLDR:  \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 But not because of the MOASS.",

        "selftext": "I came across this thread on twitter and thought it was a fantastic view on a lot of things from the 90's dotcom bubble. For reference, [please refer to the Twitter thread here](https://twitter.com/corry_wang/status/1345192541545766915) which has some fantastic notes and charts that I did not paste into the transcript below.\n\nSince there have been so many comparisons recently discussing tech froth, I think this is a wonderful share, especially for the majority of people here who were not investors during that time period. Definitely sheds a lot of light on some popular market cliches that misconstrue that period (IE, \"you can only recognize a bubble in hindsight\").  I do not know or follow this person, but still thought this was worth sharing as I came across it.\n\n**Lessons:** \n\nLessons From The Tech Bubble:  Last year, I spent my winter holiday reading hundreds of pages of equity research from the 1999/2000 era, to try to understand what it was like investing during the bubble  A few people recently asked me for my takeaways. \n\nHere they are - Every document hereon comes from my former employer Bernstein Research's internal research archive, which extend back to 1994  Unfortunately, they're not available to the public (even Bernstein's client website cuts off at 2003), but happy to give more details if necessary (see twitter thread for graphic documents).\n\n**LESSON #1**: Everybody knew it was a bubble  Unfortunately, the quip \"it's not a bubble if everyone says it is\" just isn't true  Investors were comparing the internet sector to tulip mania as early as mid-98. Bernstein held an entire conference on it in June 99! \n\n**LESSON #2:** Calling bubbles is easy, making money is hard  In truth, the hard part about the tech bubble wasn't noticing it. The hard part was timing it  Our equity strategist tried in January 99... he was off by 14 months (and another 30 point gap in value vs growth) \n\n**LESSON #3:** Nobody knew the bubble popped until months after it did  Nobody noticed in March 2000 when it finally popped. Our equity strategist (who bet his career on it!) didn't catch on until June \n\n**LESSON #4:** \"Tech\" bubble was a misnomer... it was really a large cap growth bubble  See the valuation table below, 1 year before the top  Yes, Microsoft traded at 70x earnings. But Coca Cola was 43x. Pfizer was 92x. Every stock here was a disaster over the next 10 years... \n\n**LESSON #5:** Most large cap tech stocks in the bubble had real businesses with strong fundamentals  The internet stocks were a sideshow. In 2000, the software sector had a $1 trillion market cap, 20% net margins, 20% annual growth  The problem? It was trading at 16x sales \n\n**LESSON #6:** Fundamentals follow price, not vice versa  The bubble popped in Q1 2000. Fundamentals didn't decelerate until Q4 2000.   It was reflexivity at work. Lower stock prices = less capex spend = less revenue growth = lower stock prices. A vicious cycle \n\nWhat's the takeaway here?   Be humble.  For bears, it's easy to call a bubble. Anybody can do that. Timing is the hard part  For bulls, it's easy to point to the fundamentals. Historical investors weren't dumb. The hard part is matching fundamentals with price...",

        "selftext": "**TLDR: If you are pretty sure about what the trajectory of the Georgia Senate Runoffs will be, you can make money. Scroll to the bottom for the plays (for each outcome)**\n\n**Introduction:**  \nAlmost everyone on this sub knows QQQ. Now, recall the price action around Nov. 3 (or if you can't because you're that guy from the movie Memento, pull out your Robinhood app and follow along with me kid).  \n\nOn the eve of the general election, when the so-called pollsters said it would be a Democratic sweep, QQQ sat at $269. The next day, with the election contested, QQQ rocketed to $294. It remained steady on Friday, before declining the next week.  \n\nWhy did the election affect the price the way that it did? Well, it's because Biden's legislative agenda depends on Democratic control of Congress. In particular, he can raise corporate taxes with just a simple majority in the Senate.  \n\nThe institutional whales (the folks who actually move markets) believe that:\n- Companies that benefitted bigly from Trump's tax cuts (tech companies especially) will be hurt by Biden raising taxes.\n- Companies that would benefit from fiscal stimulus (green new deal, infrastructure) will be helped by by Biden's plans, and even more if Biden controls Congress.  \n- Regardless of who controls the Senate, the divided nature means some companies are guaranteed to benefit.\n\nDon't take my word for it. Read this report from Goldman Sachs (p.15-16): https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/beyond-2020-post-election-policies-f/report.pdf   \n\nOriginally, tech companies (facing more regulation and tax increases under the Democratic Trifecta) was trending down. But then, when it became clear the Republicans would hold the Senate and taxes weren't going up, tech stocks soared. Yet, suddenly, there was a small blip downward the next week. Why? Because David Perdue (R) was headed to a runoff, injecting the possibility that Democrats still had a chance to control Congress.  \n\n**Which stocks are impacted, and why**\n\nIf Democrats gain control of the U.S. Senate, that means Biden can pass his legislation.\n- Some companies will be helped bigly (e.g. Renewables)\n- Some companies may be hurt (more taxes) but also helped (more fiscal spending)\n- Some companies may be hurt bigly (more taxes, regs, and less gov't subsidies)\n\n\nTo make this a pure election-related play, we want to trade:\n- companies that benefit bigly from Democratic legislation (and don't have short-term non-political risk)\n- companies that are hurt bigly from Democratic legislation (and don't have short-term non-political risk)\n\nSo what companies benefitted the most from Trump's tax cuts? (Source: Goldman Sachs Client note)  \n- Tech companies like Netflix, which saw its effective tax rate go from 23% to 7%.\n- Railroad companies like CSX, which saw its effective tax rate go from 37% to 23%.\n- Healthcare companies like HCA, which saw its effective tax rate go from 32% to 20%.\n- Pure financial companies like CME, saw its effective tax rate go from 36% to 23%.\n\nObviously, pandemic-related questions muddle price-action on healthcare. At the same time, there is still some policy uncertainty to what will happen to railroads regardless of the outcome of the runoffs (they will have higher taxes, but that may be offset by stimulus/infrastructure spending). That leaves two sectors as our pure election plays:\n- Tech companies will get more regulation and higher taxes if Biden takes Senate\n- Financials will get more regulation and higher taxes if Biden takes Senate\n\nOut of those sectors, specific companies may be overvalued or undervalued, and other concerns may matter more than legislative impact by the U.S Congress. For example, BABA is a tech company in QQQ, but as a Chinese company it sure isn't going to impacted much by U.S. tax legislation. We can just ignore it.\n\nHowever, a U.S. company like NFLX which is a bit overpriced and very exposed to a tax-cut rollback, is an excellent bear trade for a Democratic Senate scenario (especially if corporate tax increases start being mentioned). While MSFT, which is slightly under-valued and also exposed to tax increases, may be a good trade against a Democratic Senate.  \n\n\nInformation about the races to consider:\n- In the November General election:\n\t- Perdue (R) won 49.7 percent of the vote, while Ossoff (D) won 47.9 percent. In other words, Ossoff substantially underperformed Biden.\n\t- The Republican candidates (Loeffer + Collins) won a combined 49.4 percent, while the Democratic candidates (Warnock et al) won a combined 48.4 percent.\n\t- These are both substantial leads for the Republicans.\n- The \"reputable\" polls:\n\t- Republican-leaning Trafalgar Group (\"most accurate pollster of 2016\"), which had Trump up 3-4% in its November poll (i.e. 3-4% wrong), has now pegged both the Democratic candidates leading slightly in its late December poll.\n\t- Democratic-leaning Survey-USA (which has pretty accurate polling) had Biden up 1-2% in its last general election poll, is now predicting a Democratic sweep in its late December poll\n\t- Poll to Watch: AJC/UGA, with polling by UGA Professor Trey Hood (the most accurate major poll this year for Georgia). This will be released soon.\n- The Rev. Raphael Warnock is currently in divorce proceedings, and was recently accused by his wife of running over her foot with his car. Watch for whether this gains any traction (or at least enough to sway swing voters)\n\n\nThe plays:\n- If you expect both Democratic Senate candidates to sweep (both 2%+), then AGGRESSIVELY short QQQ, NFLX, CME, and long green energy + industrials (e.g. etfs like TAN and Solar stocks like ENPH). I would buy weekly Jan. 8 FD puts.\n- If you expect both Democratic Senate candidates to win with a significant margin (both 0.5%+), short QQQ, NFLX, CME. I would buy puts for Jan. 15/22, since the counting might drag on a few days.\n- If you expect Republicans to comfortably hold at least one seat, long QQQ (specifically NFLX, FB, and MSFT) for Jan. 15\n- If you expect Republicans to sweep, long QQQ and short green energy for Jan. 15.\n- If you expect it to be unclear whether Republicans can hold at least one seat (think month-long recount), long vega on QQQ &amp; NFLX with a bearish tilt. This would be a short vertical call spread, or buying a medium-term strangle. \n- If you expect Trump to still be President on Jan 22 following the events of Jan. 6, aggressively short SPY and long MAGA because a civil war is probably coming.",

        "selftext": "Before diving in, a few housekeeping items:\n\n1. **I didn't write this.** Everything below has been copied and pasted from [Chris Bloomstran](https://twitter.com/ChrisBloomstran/status/1345155266468306944)'s Twitter feed. All I've added are a few edits for brevity. If you have a Twitter account, definitely give him a follow.\n2. \"**OP is a gay bear.\"** Full disclaimer, I neither own puts nor am short Tesla (although I'm definitely considering it). In fact, if Tesla were cheaper I would almost definitely be long. I'm posting this because, beneath all of the memes and shitposting, I know that all of us want to make money. Every little bit of information/analysis helps, even if we disagree with the end-conclusion.\n3. **\"Post is too long. Ban.\"** This post isn't meant for you, please move along. I know it's wordy and there aren't any pictures, but this is meant for those in this sub who enjoy a bit of reading/research. If you aren't interested in a bit of reading, please scroll past.\n4. **If you YOLO $TSLA puts because of this post, you deserve to lose your money.**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n***A single prediction for the New Year.***\n\n*Those unfamiliar with the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Regulation T will hear lots about it during 2021. The rule limits the percentage of an investment in equity securities that can be borrowed with a margin loan. A wake-up call is scheduled...*\n\n*It was widely reported this week that total margin debt reached a new high of $722B. The WSJ\u2019s 12/28 lead Business and Finance story profiled a $TSLA retail investor, a civil engineer, who had parlayed a $23k option investment in $TSLA into a $2m position. Oh boy. The gentleman is to surely and genuinely be commended for the investment. An 87x gain in a short period is extraordinary (I've never done that, nor will I). That said, a quick perusal of $TSLA twitter commentary and recommendations is terrifying.*\n\n*One can read the Journal article,* [*Investors Double Down on Stocks, Pushing Margin Debt to Record TSLA*](https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-double-down-on-stocks-pushing-margin-debt-to-record-11609077600)*, and draw two conclusions. One, \u201cThis must be extremely dangerous,\u201d or two, \u201cSurely I can get rich quick too.\u201d Human nature being what it is\u2026 For the latter, the civil engineer offers this advice on his Twitter page, \u201cIf you have no Tesla call options, you may want to do the math and consider using LEAPS as a way to accelerate your accumulation of Tesla stock. 40X in 2020. Another 50X by 2025.\u201d Whoa.*\n\n*A series of Q&amp;A tweets ensues (thanks for the heads up* [*@RomanRubinstein*](https://twitter.com/romanrubinstein?lang=en)*) on which broker/dealers offer the most margin, the lowest interest rate on margin debt, and how to borrow the most money and obtain the maximum leverage by purchasing call options. \u201cMaintain margin value of 50% in my portfolio and the margin borrowing rides forever,\u201d goes the advice. Please consider the danger of heeding this advice. The engineer should risk-off and live a happy life.*\n\n*A whole bunch of people are going to lose a whole bunch of money.*\n\n*Reading through a series of tweets among the Tesla (and others) option crowd, you see little, if any, mention of maintenance margin requirements. FINRA requires investors, strike that, speculators, to maintain equity of at least 25% of the value of an account. Leverage kills. Maintenance rates can be set above the minimum threshold. The concept of posting shares in stocks like $TSLA, $TWTR, or any established company trading for 20x or 30x sales &amp; borrowing half of the value and then buying calls on the same shares posted as collateral is insanity. The only \u201cmath\u201d a speculator should be doing is knowing at what price against the shares in the account will new equity be required. Most brokers don\u2019t wait around for a customer to come up with new cash or securities to deposit. What do they do?*\n\n*They sell down your shares to get to equity compliance. More decline? More forced selling. Depending on maintenance margin thresholds, you can lose it all in a hurry. Red flags are abundant, beyond simply the new record high in total margin and credit market debt outstanding. You can see the bubble in the number of single-contract call options outstanding, in the number of new retail accounts being opened with margin and allowed option trading, and even in the tone of surety by speculators regarding prospects for wildly expensive shares like Tesla.*\n\n*I never thought I\u2019d again see the kind of mania like we saw in the late 1990\u2019s, but here we are. Memories of what can and is likely to happen are long gone. Even a number of professional investors have suspended price as a key determinant of value.  A respected and well-known retired professional investor suggested on Twitter recently that I don\u2019t understand \u201c$TSLA growth math or basic investment theory,\u201d that \u201cstocks look forward, not backward\u201d and that \u201cP/E\u2019s are a function of exponential growth rates, not industry.\u201d*\n\n*The last time an investment pro came unglued was January 2000 at a newspaper roundtable. The C.I.O/PM for one of the largest &amp; oldest growth &amp; income funds at the time took exception to the notion that $MSFT shareholders would lose money for the next 15 years, which they did. I\u2019d written 6 pages on the prediction in my 1/1/2000 letter (on the website) and discussed it at the roundtable. My co-panelist became unhinged because he and his firm had 5% of capital in $MSFT, which was then a $620B market cap on $20B in sales, 31x sales &amp; 80x earnings.*\n\n*You can apply the same logic to $TSLA or to any number of dangerously overvalued fashionable disruptive growers today. The Tesla bull proffering margined purchase of $TSLA LEAPS expects a $1,000 share price this year, $5,000 the next and $22,000 by 2025.*\n\n*Now, a $22,000 stock price, assuming no further dilution above today\u2019s 1.1B fully diluted shares outstanding, gets you to a $24 trillion market value, which must be reasonable given that the entire market value of the S&amp;P 500 today is only \\~$31 trillion &amp; global GDP is $88T. When your TAM (the new eyeballs) is 100% global auto market share, robotaxi, energy grid, insurance and economic population of Mars, no price is too high. No argument that Tesla has made great strides in manufacturing efficiency and are now producing a more reliable product.*\n\n*I also believe disruption of the auto industry will require an enormous amount of capital to grow and the established OEM\u2019s won\u2019t play dead. You can't simply separate auto margins and capital requirements from nearly infinite profitability earned by selling software upgrades. Shouldn\u2019t the upgrades be considered part of total vehicle cost? To what extent did the Apples and Microsofts of the world thrive on a regular upgrade cycle, much of which was and is planned. How often are you compelled into a new iPhone or iPad? Prior to the subscription model, at what point did Microsoft not support an older operating system or Office suite? Will EV buyers purchase a new car every 2-3 years? How much of the world can afford a more expensive vehicle than the current global average car price?*\n\n*Regardless of one's beliefs on business quality &amp; growth prospects, paying a too-high price can destroy future investment return. #neversell? When price becomes ridiculous to the most optimistic business case you #bettersell. Price matters and the current environment is nuts. The current folly for price not mattering, or being justifiably high, reminds me of a well known sell-side report on Berkshire Hathaway in 1998 which assumed as undervalued both $BRK\u2019s shares and its stock portfolio against an assumed \u201creasonable\u201d 40x market multiple.*\n\n*Berkshire\u2019s shares, expensive, would fall by half over the next 18 months to a February 2000 low. It\u2019s become fashionable to explain investment process by saying price is the last consideration. Too often lately, price isn\u2019t even a consideration, especially for holy growers. While I did not have a short position on $MSFT in 2000, I do have a very small recent short on Tesla today so take my comments w/ a grain of salt. I did buy $MSFT in '06 after it fell by \\~75% and owned it for a decade, trimming when dear and adding to the position when cheap.*\n\n*Short selling is very risky and those w/ sizable short positions on Tesla at the outset of 2020 would have suffered real damage given the 720% advance during the year. I've read that shorts lost $38B during '20 alone on their collective positions &amp; short interest is way down. I happen to think the valuation is now so large to protect against a continued runaway price, particularly now that* u/elonmusk *secured its entry in the S&amp;P 500 by engineering 4 quarters of profits by cutting R&amp;D, SG&amp;A and thanks to environmental credits courtesy $GM &amp; $FCA.*\n\n*Still, I\u2019d never employ a large short position given unlimited downside and a max return of 100%. Margin is required against short positions. What appears to be a growing army of retail option traders, many employing sizable margin debt, is a recipe for disaster. Price and quality conscious investors get uncomfortable at times like these. I am extremely uncomfortable. I hope those that have no idea what they are doing heed growing and now very high risk and fully understand downside and what margin calls and maintenance margin mean.*\n\n*Many, many speculators will lose much and even all of their money at some point as this bubble breaks. Now is the time to reduce risk. You could feel badly for employees that were paid in non-qualified stock options and kept their shares upon exercise in the late 1990\u2019s. When shares plummeted in the wake of the tech bubble the tax liability due on gain realized as income upon exercise was still due and payable, despite shares that were way below the exercise price. It was bad. Many lost everything but weren\u2019t in a position to understand risk.*\n\n*Borrowing against Tesla (or any) shares and buying call options presents serious deliberately assumed risk. For perspective, a 92% decline takes the shares back to where they started 2020! With margin, it will take way less than a 92% decline to introduce wipeout.*\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Responding to a PM who claims that the $TSLA price target of $1,200, total EV adoption of 20%, and 5% market share in global auto-manufacturing is reasonable, Bloomstran had this to say:**\n\n*You have EV adoption rising from 3% to 20% in five years, a 6x increase (46% CAGR) and Tesla market share at 25%. 2019 global new vehicle sales totaled \\~95m units and will be way lower this year. Let's call 2020 a throwaway for the industry, and hats off to* [*$TSLA*](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&amp;src=cashtag_click) *for growing. From the 2019 base, if we assume 4% market growth then new global units in 2025 would be 115m and at your expected 20% share Tesla would sell 29 million vehicles. Is this your assumption? Sounds aggressive given Tesla\u2019s 500k unit run rate for 2020 and 1/2% market share.*\n\n*Now, US new vehicle prices are $38k but significantly lower worldwide, let\u2019s say $30k per vehicle sold globally. The average Tesla looks to range from high $30k\u2019s for the Model 3 to $55k for the Model 3 Performance to $125k for the Model X Performance fully loaded.  What do you expect for an average selling price for Tesla in 2025? I\u2019d presume that as market share expands ASP\u2019s will have to fall to affordable. I\u2019m trying to get to a revenue number.*\n\n*Perhaps the governments of the world will be giving $2k per person, $8k per family of 4 in annual perpetuity, surely making new cars more affordable! If Tesla sells 29m units in 2025 @ $34.5k per unit, that gets sales to $1 trillion, a CAGR of \\~102% for five years. Reasonable?*\n\n*Moving on, you have a 2025 EPS target of $24/share. On how many shares shall we apply your expected per-share figure? Shares outstanding at 9/30 totaled 948m, up from 905m at yearend 2019. An additional $5B in shares were sold recently to the public in \u201cat-the-market\u201d sales.  The sales were done with no roadshow, risk disclosure or prospectus, unless Goldman\u2019s report upgrading the shares from neutral to buy &amp; a new price target of $780, up from $455, issued days before the announced sale and Goldman\u2019s retention as selling agent, as a \u201cprospectus.\"*\n\n*If the shares were sold at an average of \\~$600/share, the share count would now be 8.3m shares higher, so call the total 956m. You have a price target of $1,200 for the shares, so let\u2019s not forget to include in the count any option and RSU shares issued but not yet exercised.  Recall,* [*@elonmusk*](https://twitter.com/elonmusk) *was granted 20m option shares (now 100m thanks to the split) in 2018 by* [*@larryellison*](https://twitter.com/larryellison) *and Elon\u2019s associates on the board. Fully diluted shares total 1.113B right now, and if the stock keeps rising we can assume all options will be exercised and outstanding.*\n\n*So, how many shares should we apply to your $24 EPS target? If we assume zero further dilution (realistic?), then using the 1.113B fully diluted shares including the recent $5b sale, we get to $26.7B in net income. On an even $1 trillion in revenues, that\u2019s a 2.67% profit margin, just a bit higher than the auto industry average of 3% and approaching $MSFT\u2019s 30%.*\n\n*One last missing piece of information, which I haven\u2019t seen mentioned by the Tesla bulls or in your message to me is how much capital will be required to grow sales from 500k units to 29m over the next 5 years?  It looks like over the history of* [*$TSLA*](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&amp;src=cashtag_click) *the company has raised $26.5B in equity capital (including the recent $5B) and $16.5B in debt and preferred equity, so a total of $43B. Tesla has a cumulative loss of $5.7B, so it hasn\u2019t produced a positive return on capital.*\n\n*For its last 4 quarters GAAP profits totaled $5.56B, which yields a 2.5% return on capital (equity net of retained losses plus debt minus cash, all adjusted for the recent $5B sale). I fully understand companies can surely lose money or earn little profit as they scale.  With the recent sale of $5B Tesla now has \\~$20B in cash. Is this sufficient to finance its growth over the next 5 years as the company grows units by 102% per year?*\n\n*Since I don\u2019t lean on brevity and given my lack of understanding of basic investment theory, let\u2019s summarize the missing data points necessary to get the stock to your target of $1,200 per share, 50 times your 2025 EPS target of $24 per share. Needed: 1) Tesla unit sales in 2025? 2) Average selling price per unit? 3) Any non-auto related sales \u2013 insurance, robotaxi, insurance, energy sales? 4) Shares outstanding? 5) Total capital: Additional paid in capital, debt, preferred equity, cash?*\n\n*At your 50x $24 EPS $1,200  price target,* [*$TSLA*](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&amp;src=cashtag_click) *returns 11.2% pa from Thursday\u2019s $705.67 close. I happen to think shares in* [*$BRK*](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BRK&amp;src=cashtag_click)*, my largest holding, are likely to compound at roughly that rate, assuming a 10% ROE and a terminal price at 1.3x book value, up from \\~1.2x today.*",

        "selftext": "(*Editor's note: It's a wild day for the market and the country, and I will try to be as neutral as possible despite the fuckery afoot)*.\n\n* Dems clinched the GA Senate run-off election as Warnock defeats Loeffler while Ossoff defeats Perdue (the first millennial Senator). As the results became more clear last night, futures took a deep dive particularly for NQ, while conversely small caps enjoys a favorable bump. The market opened deeply red for QQQ as big tech retreated with renew fear on antitrust probes  and overall an unfriendly corporate environment as Democrats will control WH and both chambers of Congress. \n\n* By early morning, the sell-off quickly reversed and big tech recovered most of their red, with big tech such as AAPL going from -3% to just shy of yesterday's close during day's high. In contrast to big tech, clean tech and weed soared on Dems securing the Senate. ICLN was up almost 4% during pre-market and as high as 9% during intraday high and HASI was up 10% during intraday high. Weed stock such as TLRY was up as high as 21%, ACB as high as 11%+, and APHA as high as 14%.\n\n* Things quickly pulled back and tech started fading in earnest at 2:15 PM ET when protestors [cosplaying as revolutionaries](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106820104-1609961746992-gettyimages-1230453313-AFP_8YA6MW.jpg) stormed the capitol and Congress had to quickly pause their certifying of the Electoral College votes. Shit got real when a lady got shot as these protestors attempt to storm the [barricaded House chamber](https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1600/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F210106150417-03-house-chamber-0106.jpg) while Reps were still in the building.\n\n* The sell-off accelerated for AAPL, AMZN, FB, MSFT, and NFLX as most drilled back to opening lows by EOD. AAPL closed the day -3.37% to $126.60, AMZN -2.49% to $3,138, FB -2.83% to $263, MSFT -2.59% to $212, and NFLX -3.9% to $500.49. Thanks to overall negative sentiment of all things tech, QQQ closed the day red at -1.39% to $307 (retreating quite a bit more than IXIC given the weigh of big tech in QQQ).\n\n* Morning economic numbers had ADP reporting payrolls dropping to 123k in Dec, slightly below consensus of 130k. PMI was at 54.8 while consensus was 55.3, while factory order was up 1.0% MoM. Thankfully, none of these number fucking matters as the Dow, SPY, and IWM proceed to sky rocket with the market looking forward to stronger spending and stimulus from a Dem controlled govt.\n\n* Beyond weed, clean tech, and infrastructure - financial sector killed it today in particular mid-cap banks such as ZION (up 11.24%), CNC (up 9.81%), and KEY (up 9.73%). You'll find a similar story for large-cap bank stock with JPM closing up 4.70%, BAC up 6.25%, C up 5.75%, and WFC up 7.08%. It's a good thing I've already dumped my reopening [WFC leaps play](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kftjzt/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/ggarcbi/) of $25c and $30c which are now fucking ITM by $3~$8 and still have a year left to go on them. Nice.\n\n* In yet another confusing about-face and showing a real Karen spunk, the NYSE is *really* delisting the three Chinese telecoms this time. The real kicker though came in at 2:25 PM ET when news broke that US officials are considering *more* Chinese stock delisting, adding Chinese big tech Alibaba, Tencent, et al. to the potential list. A sea of red soon followed to compound the sell-off as BABA crater to the Earth's core and closed down -5.32%. Following suit, PDD closed down -5.58%, JD down -7.66%, and the same goes for Chinese EV NIO at -5% and XPEV at -2.62%. LI escapes semi-unscathed and closed the day up 2.48% thanks to a new BofA coverage with a Buy rating and a PT of $42.\n\n* In WSB meme stock land, GME was on track for a solid 8-9% day until the storming of the capitol occurred, PLTR's fade accelerated further while MT stays modestly flat, bouncing back from the overall market sell off. GME closed up 5.70% to $18.36, PLTR closed down -4.31% to $23.54, and MT closed up 0.32% to $24.70. ICLN, a new WSB favorite due to new balance of power in Congress might be added to future roundup if it continues to pump. Imagine that, a clean energy boomer ETF becoming a meme stock. The iShares fund managers are probably wondering why their alerts going tits up with social media mentions and sentiment brewing.\n\n* Random trade ideas (these are not financial advice and if it goes wrong that's your own gdamn fault):\n\n    1) FSLY leaps Jan 2022 90c or 100c+ for eventual TikTok climbing back fully onto the service as ByteDance pointedly makes a political jab at outgoing administration. Headwind on this retarded play: cloud/stay-at-home stock continues to take a beating as rona gets under control as vaccine roll out picks up. \n\n    2) Sell AAPL cash secured puts Jan 15 120p to 122p if the big tech fade continues rest of the week. These ~0.18 to 0.24 delta strikes are likely safe enough and if assigned, you'll have an upcoming ER on Jan 26 to sell IV pumped covered calls to get out of the trade intact. Feb 19 puts are likely okay to sell as well given you'll receive much more premium from the ~43 dte chains. Headwinds on this retarded play: its CSP and CC. As boomer as it gets. \n\n    3) BABA leaps and/or March debit call spread for another bounce in a wild trading week for BABA. March 230c/250c is probably a sufficient spread while baking in a bit of IV via ER which is on Feb 11. Jan 230c to 250c if you're not poor. Headwind on this retarded play: Jack Ma really is missing and the US govt really will delist a 600 bil market cap Chinese ADR, forcing out all major US institution holders. Yeah, right.\n\n* The DOW closed up 1.44% or 437 pts, Nasdaq down -0.61% or -78 pts, S&amp;P up 0.57% or 21 pts, and RUT closed up 3.98% (!!) or 78 pts. Stay in school kids and avoid storming federal buildings or Twitter will start banning your fucking account. (TWTR locks POTUS account for 12 hrs and is down -1.99% AH).\n\n(Yesterday's [recap](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kr7ze8/reeeeeeeeecap_of_todays_market_driving_news_jan_5/)).",

        "selftext": " \n\nI will argue that GME is a value trap because it has no virtuous cycle to improve cash flow as its business model has been disrupted by the digital transformation of online video game sales and discounts. GME is set to default in the next 8 months without further cash infusion.\n\n# Business Model\n\nGME has margins has always been reselling popular titles. They buy low and sell high for popular titles. This has worked in the past but the tipping point had arrived in 2019 \\[1\\] putting severe pressure in the old business model.  \n\nIn the next generation console, online purchases will continue to be dominant. Moreover, when popular titles become less popular, they are heavily discounted online, incentivizing consumers to find deals online rather than holding on to physical media.\n\nThis compression in its high margin and sharp drop in foot traffic to drive sales will continue to impair cash flow in the future, leading to a solvency problem.\n\nLastly, the previous console generation had been saturated. It\u2019ll be unsustainable for GME to depend on customer selling and buying previous console titles.\n\n# Competitor Advantage\n\nThere has been excitement about Ryan Cohen trying to transform GME to an online business. But the competitor moats are too big to overcome. Microsoft and Sony own game studios and will continue to offer better deals on their online platform. There is no way for GME to compete with these monopolistic moats.\n\nIt is important to note that Blockbuster tried to shift online once it realize that Netflix had disrupted its business model. Blockbuster was unsuccessful because of Netflix\u2019s first move advantage, ability to raise large debt, and operate at massive losses at scale to undercut Blockbuster move online.\n\nA similar environment is facing GME as it plans its online pivot. Microsoft and Sony have massive cash reserves and at scale, and lower marginal operating costs compared to GME online business. Moreover, they control studios and can offer their exclusives first buying opportunities on their platforms before sales move to secondary platforms.\n\n# Value Trap\n\nGME has no virtuous cycle. Unlike Blue Apron that was able to improve cash flow because of the pandemic and people buying meal kits, or TSLA improving production and selling more green credits to improve production, GME has no virtuous cycle.\n\nMarket analysis indicates there is a structural shift to online buying and online platform to provide heavily discounted prices of popular titles once their popularity wanes.\n\nI will argue that GME business model is similar to Blockbuster after it was disrupted by Netflix. GME is in a death spiral, unable to compete against Microsoft or Sony.\n\n# Cash Flow Problems\n\nGME operating loss in October 2020 was 184M. They had 450M in cash \\[2\\] at the end of October. This implies a runway of 2-3 quarters in which they need to raise cash or face default.\n\n# Short Squeeze Mania Explained\n\nMuch excitement has been made about a possible short squeeze against Melvin Capital. People point to the recent 100% rise in GME to argue for a short squeeze. Much discussion has been made of it so I won\u2019t add to it, except to offer another explanation, focusing on MM and delta hedging.\n\nAs rumours about an infinite short squeeze on GME rose, a sharp rise in call option buying occurred. MM as part of their delta hedges would need to buy up shares. However encountering few shares to buy MM started buying ITM calls, and moving to OTM calls. This led to higher prices and MM needing to further buy shares and call options to delta hedge. So the steep rise in price wasn\u2019t from Melvin Capital but MM delta hedging. Furthermore, realizing the risky positions MM had taken as part of delta hedging (imperfect hedges) they decided to eliminate GME margins to slow down the gamma convexity\n\nTherefore it is the MM that had been buying shares and not Melvin Capital. This is supported by the early evidence that Shorts took on more shorts/puts as the price went up.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nGME is at risk of default in 6-8 months and a short squeeze may not come. ***In fact what may be happening is that retails have entered a massive value trap that will cause them to lose most of their investment should GME continue to face a cash crunch on weak sales/massive operating cash flow losses over the next 8 months without a huge cash injection***. Even then their business model is structurally problematic.\n\nAsk yourself, would you have invested in Blockbuster when you heard it was moving its business online?\n\n\\[1\\] https://screenrant.com/digital-game-sales-consoles-outnumber-physical-first-time/\n\n\\[2\\] https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/financials?p=GME\n\n\\[3\\] https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/cash-flow?p=GME",

        "selftext": "I'm in tech and I have good news if you like money. Shorting Intel is too obvious I don't know. why options are so cheap to buy. \n\n**Why Intel is doomed**\n\nIntel have missed their own deadlines for delivering newer manufacturing methods and their CPUs are falling behind AMD in terms of cost and performance for a while. That is not the news. The stock is already hit by AMD performance. Intel is doomed because our industry is moving to Arm. Arm processors are performing way better at a fraction of cost. See [this report](https://www.anandtech.com/show/15578/cloud-clash-amazon-graviton2-arm-against-intel-and-amd/9) if you're not convinced. What I'm seeing in the industry is that a lot of cloud computing customers are finding it super easy to switch to Arm. Developer computers are mostly Macs and the M1 Macs are just the tip of the iceberg on what's going to happen. Once developers can easily develop on Arm machines, they most likely will deploy their code to an Arm cloud server. Amazon's AWS Graviton is performing well enough to switch. \n\n**Microsoft will kill Intel** \n\nApple is doing their part with M1 and Amazon is balls deep with their Arm chips but what makes a huge difference is Microsoft's energy for fucking intel in the ass by making Windows Arm friendly and pulling a fast one on Intel by developing their own chips. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**\n\nAmazon, Apple and Microsoft are going to gang bang Intel's wife.

        "selftext": "I don't know much, but I know tech and AMD has A LOT going for it right now.\n\n[*Obligatory do your own research and draw your own conclusions statement.*]\n\n**POSITIVES**\n\n- Both Sony and Microsoft are using custom AMD APUs in their latest consoles. (APU = CPU + GPU combined into one.) In case you've been living under a rock for the past 8 weeks, both the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X have been selling like hotcakes, with fresh inventory being depleted within minutes. \n\n- AMD has been the underdog vs Intel in the consumer desktop CPU space for as long as I can remember. But for the first time in 15 years, [AMD is winning in terms of market share](https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-overtakes-intel-in-desktop-cpu-market-share-for-the-first-time-in-15-years). Intel has been able to stay competitive with their latest generation of CPUs by offering significant discounts. Despite this, AMD's CPUs still remain in higher demand and sell out almost instantly (at MSRP). \n\n- AMD owns Radeon, which is their brand of Graphics Cards. These compete directly with Nvidia's RTX GPUs. Performance wise, they're up there with NVDA, but still lagging a bit in the ray tracing department which most will agree is the future. Key word being future, it's not a big deal *yet*. And thanks to the pandemic these too also sell out super quick. \n\n- AMD's next generation of mobile CPUs will be launching soon. Just like their desktop lineup, you can expect these to outperform their Intel counterparts as well. AMD's previous mobile generation of 4000 series chips crushed Intel - the biggest problem was availability. People wanted the AMD chips but for whatever reason, they were found mostly in the mid-range and lower end gaming laptops. I expect the availability issue to improve greatly this year. As we can see, certain manufacturer's like Asus are already featuring the AMD SKUs in their [top of the line gaming laptops](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-ROG-Strix-Scar-17-ditches-Comet-Lake-H-for-an-unlocked-Ryzen-9-5900HX-with-liquid-metal-and-RTX-3080-Mobile.514702.0.html). \n\n**RISK FACTORS**\n\n- While speaking purely from a monetary standpoint, overall I think the pandemic has been a net positive for tech companies like AMD. However, AMD's own fearless leader Lisa Su recently said: [\"...the COVID environment has increased shipping and freight costs, which are hard to avoid. As we get into a more normal environment, this should improve. This also matters for our planned graphics updates through the first half of the year, as we have a lot of product coming to market.\"](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16409/amd-ceo-dr-lisa-su-interview-on-2021-demand-supply-tariffs-xilinx-and-epyc)\n\n- Unable to keep up with demand: [AMD and NVIDIA confirm that GPU stock levels will remain non-existent for the foreseeable future](https://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-and-NVIDIA-confirm-that-GPU-stock-levels-will-remain-non-existent-for-the-foreseeable-future.514957.0.html).\n[Microsoft has asked AMD for help in combating Xbox Series X stock shortages](https://www.techradar.com/news/microsoft-has-asked-amd-for-help-in-combating-xbox-series-x-stock-shortages)\n\n- Apple has already started producing their own in house ARM processors for both their laptops and desktops. This doesn't really affect AMD (yet) because [Apple has been using Intel chips in their laptops and desktops for the past 15 years.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/10/why-apple-is-breaking-a-15-year-partnership-with-intel-on-its-macs-.html#:~:text=Menu-,Apple%20is%20breaking%20a%2015%2Dyear%20partnership%20with,on%20its%20Macs%20%E2%80%94%20here's%20why&amp;text=Apple's%20new%20laptops%20and%20desktop,can%20improve%20laptop%20battery%20life.) And despite being a massive company, Apple only makes up about [13% of the PC market share](https://www.statista.com/statistics/576473/united-states-quarterly-pc-shipment-shareapple/#:~:text=In%20the%20fourth%20quarter%20of,the%20fourth%20quarter%20of%202020.). AMD is still Apple's partner for discrete graphics, but that could change soon. This is definitely something you'll want to keep your eye on though because other titans like [Microsoft](https://www.reuters.com/article/microsoft-processors-int/microsoft-working-on-in-house-chips-for-its-servers-pcs-idUSKBN28S2Y1), [Google](https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2020/04/google-is-making-its-own-chips.html), and Amazon are all either working on, or producing their own in house chips. In my opinion, this is not nearly as bad as it sounds. Let's break it down by company.\n\n - [Microsoft currently uses Intel-based processors for the majority of its Azure cloud services, and most of the company\u2019s Surface lineup run on Intel chips, too.](https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189450/microsoft-arm-processors-chips-servers-surface-report#:~:text=Microsoft%20has%20worked%20with%20AMD,move%20away%20from%20just%20Intel.&amp;text=Microsoft%20co%2Dengineered%20an%20ARM,a%20couple%20of%20months%20ago.) Only some of Microsoft's laptops run on AMD hardware. \n\n - [Google is readying its own in-house processors for use in future Pixel devices, including both phones and eventually Chromebooks, too.](https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/14/google-said-to-be-preparing-its-own-chips-for-use-in-pixel-phones-and-chromebooks/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADHPvna5MKFbSAnwNIPsW4kMhD7zhe-7IJtk0AzQP1Rrer78Olm_S_019orsNcQA9Ezk_sCz0z8My1nHGdTap_0-SYZtHKs1U9v9ni-AGkuJzp3cOHYUDSEu7b90qMQIDsc-PC8tFFceJElhUcPhJ3ctKtatuQcLkrIF1VotSBz1#:~:text=The%20Axios%20report%20says%20that,machine%20learning%20and%20Google%20Assistant.) Again, because Google currently relies more on Intel CPUs this is not a big blow to AMD's bottom line. A quick check of BestBuy's inventory shows [47](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?_dyncharset=UTF-8&amp;id=pcat17071&amp;iht=y&amp;keys=keys&amp;ks=960&amp;list=n&amp;qp=parent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Celeron%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20i3%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20i5%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20i7%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20m3%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20m7%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Pentium&amp;sc=Global&amp;st=chromebook&amp;type=page&amp;usc=All%20Categories) Chromebooks with Intel SKUs and only [7 with AMD parts](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?_dyncharset=UTF-8&amp;id=pcat17071&amp;iht=y&amp;keys=keys&amp;ks=960&amp;list=n&amp;qp=parent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~AMD%20A4%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~AMD%20A6%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~AMD%20Ryzen%203&amp;sc=Global&amp;st=chromebook&amp;type=page&amp;usc=All%20Categories).\n - The chips that Amazon is producing are for their [cloud computing business](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/technology/amazon-apple-chips-intel-arm.html). These were also replaced by Intel.\n\nAMD has earnings coming up on the 26th which I think they're going to shatter. I probably would not recommend trying to play off of that though as ERs can be quite unpredictable, especially if the news is positive. Personally, I think AMD is going to \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 after ER, but I'm not betting on that. Which is why my current position (30% of my portfolio) is LEAPS: (x2) Jan 2022 90c.\n\nMy conservative 6 month PT for AMD is 110. Also open to hearing any other potential risks I may have overlooked. To be on the safe side I'm only including 6 rockets.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

During this time, GME bulls have been blessed with a sleuth of positive news. Before we start cookin let me get all the ingredients into the pot for you guys:\n\n# Tendie Recipe\n\n[Provided to you by GME shorts](https://preview.redd.it/sg8apugjsm961.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17bb70cb3f0a0c5c4bf91e8505e7655177ef15c5)\n\n# Ingredients\n\n1 **DIGITAL** revenue sharing agreement with GameStop  [(certified fresh by Domo Capital Management)](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/10/microsoft-will-give-gamestop-a-share-of-xboxs-digital-revenues/)\n\nXbox Game Pass subscriptions to taste [(15 million subs at $9.99 / month as of Sep 2020)](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21449219/xbox-game-pass-15-million-subscribers-microsoft-growth).\n\n1 acquisition of one of largest private game developers in the world for $7.5 billion dollars  [(responsible for elder scrolls, fallout, doom...)](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/09/21/welcoming-bethesda-to-the-xbox-family/)\n\n# Cooking Instructions\n\nYou have to have a chef's vision to see all this come together - the goal is to stew enough Game Pass subscriptions to make more and more tendies later on. How do we stew more Game pass subs?\n\n* Bullets below - More Game Pass subs = \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n   * Take the acquisition above and put some of their best games on Game Pass letting anyone on the subscription play it on Console or on PC.  Steam is on PC, and developers are starting to protest them.  Sony doesn't have a gaming subscription for cross PC-Console play. The digital future will have one master race there will be no console or PC - only game.\n   * Partner with the only worldwide gaming focused retailer so they can push your products over competitors.  Sony has a bigger market share globally right now, but with GameStop, Microsoft sees its partner in crime.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80 ](https://preview.redd.it/jxf6csxg1n961.jpg?width=506&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49e265425dd12fb93f6b55c0b39ea59b6cf7992f)\n\nAbove you see how much money Microsoft can make ANNUALLY if they get more subscriptions.  Now back to the whole point of this, we need the last ingredient, that spicy Microsoft deal with GameStop.\n\nGameStop get's a cut of Microsoft's digital Xbox revenue. Here is a quote from the article I linked above:\n\n*\"Loop Capital analyst Anthony Chukumba confirmed that same basic outline to Ars Technica based on his conversations with GameStop management. \"The way it's going to work is for every Microsoft Xbox console that GameStop sells going forward, GameStop will get some percentage of the revenue from every digital full game download, DLC, microtransaction, and any subscriptions as well.\"* \n\nHow much of a cut? No one really knows. After July I'll pay one of you paper hands to find out because you're most likely better at that then making this tendie recipe.  Let's speculate though assuming GameStop collects 3% of the revenues.\n\n50 million annual subscriptions = Additional $6 billion in ANNUAL revs for Microsoft\n\nLet's say that GameStop, because they're chummy with Microsoft, sell about 35% of ongoing XBOXs moving forward, allowing them to access the digital revenue share.\n\nThis works out to be additional $63 million dollars at almost 100% margins. And this is just from **subscriptions alone**.  How much are the rest of the DLC, microtransactions, and full digital game downloads worth for GameStop?  It's hard to know because Microsoft doesn't release detailed stats.  But let's take a look at their competitor so we can extrapolate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img urv8n5y77n961...*\n\nListen, I'm not going to to sit here and convert what a million million yen is.

        "selftext": "Looks like after early rumors this week, the DA is officially out, so I thought I'd share some insights about Achronix's merger with $ACEV. It is currently trading \\~15% above NAV, and I consider it a strong buy right now. Please enjoy this quickly compiled post about ACEV/Achronix and why I think it's a great opportunity right now.\n\n[Achronix's position in the market serves as an attractive investment opportunity. Ridiculously strong financials at 76&amp;#37; gross margin.](https://preview.redd.it/ful5pypkr6a61.png?width=1277&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1512d4d40dceaaa53a38507139f21081cc10a8d3)\n\n[Achronix already has 55 patents and $400M+ in CUMULATIVE ORDERS lined up.](https://preview.redd.it/o8za6bfpr6a61.png?width=1279&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e27e7741689a78f0b331b5dde67d06aa8700d78)\n\n[Achronix's management team is filled with experienced veterans in the industry.](https://preview.redd.it/u9ukproxr6a61.png?width=1277&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77b6dc618db4f4f9c27a805dcd36741ae659acc1)\n\n[The company is poised to grow at \\~30&amp;#37; CAGR over the next 3 years.](https://preview.redd.it/ox3ms901s6a61.png?width=1278&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27d089e63c5c6361f507400d0d6b4eb95aed263d)\n\nFun facts:\n\n* It marks the **first time for a Korean PE firm** to set up a SPAC on the Nasdaq to acquire a US-based company. They don't plan to f\\*\\*\\* this up.\n* Founded in 2004, Achronix is one of the top five global fabless semiconductor companies and the **only independent supplier of high-performance field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)**. The profitable company is a key player in the global FPGA market alongside Intel Corp. and Xilinx.\n* The Silicon Valley-based FPGA maker's revenue in 2018 stood at around 67 billion won ($61.2 million), which surged to 115 billion won in 2020. This year, Achronix is expected to post 173 billion won in revenue. **Achronix will post \\~$160M in revenue for this year.**\n* Achronix's major clients include **Intel, Google, Microsoft and Samsung**. Achronix also licenses its intellectual property to **General Motors** for its advanced driver assistance system (ADAS). What a strong base of clients set-up for this company. Once the merger goes through, Achronix will gain more funding to scale their business.\n* Given its specialty in high volume and high speed data processing, **FPGAs are widely used for data centers, artificial intelligence, machine learning and 5G.** These industries are poised to grow significantly over the next few decades. Despite the buzzwords, they aren't buzzwords without validity. Achronix is positioned to serve these markets well.\n* The FPGA industry grabbed investors\u2019 attention when **Intel acquired programmable chip maker Altera in 2015 for approximately $16.7 billion**, followed by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) acquiring the leading FPGA maker Xilinx for $35 billion last year. As of today's writing, ACEV/Achronix's market cap sits at \\~$330M. In my opinion, it is severely undervalued right now.\n\nAlthough the initial rumors and Definitive Agreement came out this week across major publishers, the hype riding clean energy in SPACs overtook this announcement across the markets. **I expect this to be a strong long-term hold over the next decade. Currently, the SPAC trades at \\~15% above NAV.**\n\n[More details surrounding the merger.](https://preview.redd.it/waf6127ks6a61.png?width=985&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b48fb1bb2e5098cc9162e805e2071960388f8b6a)\n\nSource:\n\n(1) [https://www.achronix.com/sites/default/files/docs/Achronix\\_Ace\\_Merger\\_Presentation\\_VF.pdf](https://www.achronix.com/sites/default/files/docs/Achronix_Ace_Merger_Presentation_VF.pdf)\n\n(2) [https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202101080005?lang=us](https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202101080005?lang=us)\n\n(3) [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210107005892/en/Achronix-to-List-on-Nasdaq-Through-Merger-With-ACE-Convergence](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210107005892/en/Achronix-to-List-on-Nasdaq-Through-Merger-With-ACE-Convergence)\n\n(4) [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-06/achronix-is-said-in-talks-for-merger-with-blank-check-firm-ace](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-06/achronix-is-said-in-talks-for-merger-with-blank-check-firm-ace)",

        "selftext": "Hello brothers and sisters in GameStop. My sermon today is an examination of why some of our fellow autists have become millionaires while I continue to live in a cardboard box. \n\nI was an early-ish follower of the $GME faith, but when tribulations came my faith was shaken. I still went to church, but my heart wasn't in it like those we look up to. We must reflect on our failures to grow as followers in Cohen. \n\nThis testimony is long (sorry). I needed to force myself to actually examine things so I don't fuck up the next opportunity for tendies. This is my penance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**: Retard examining why I made small gains off $GME despite being in months ago. I keep track of all my trades. $GME has been a rollercoaster of emotions and opportunities in a very short time, so lots to learn. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Takeaways\n\n1. I never truly committed or believed in the position. It remained a small % of my portfolio and I was always hedging because being down even a couple % hurt, let alone -20% swings. To find 20X return you have to invest in companies that have significant uncertainty (and volatility). That  means persuasive arguments on both sides. If you lack conviction you won't be able to stay in.  \n2. Follow those charts and imagine you don't know where we end up. Put yourself in that moment. Holy fuck. **Am I buying the dip or catching a falling knife**? This has been bumpy and uncertain. We can all pretend this was a sure thing, it wasn't. It still isn't.\n3. We've all heard Fear and Greed rule the market. Its one thing to say that. Its another to feel it and observe it in yourself. My mood on $GME has flipped from \"This motherfucking boomer CEO is burning all my $\" to \"Fat FIRE, this year, motherfuckers\" 4 times in as many months. I felt intense emotions (still feeling them during the current run). W/o acclimating to balance that out I think its impossible to make good decisions. \n4. I'm very glad I kept detailed notes on what I was doing. Write down your thoughts and reason for taking a position. Revisit these. We're all retards. But that doesn't mean we can't learn our bad habits and improve. I'm stunned looking back by how often I was paralyzed and couldn't take action. \n5. None of this was obvious. There were strong cases that the business was undervalued. It was a good bet. But it was a bet. (Blasphemy you say? The true prophet, RoaringKitty said on yesterday's stream that as June turned into July and August and no PE firm or other investors stepped in he began to wonder if he was right). The business was bleeding cash, it just wasn't hemorrhaging like bears thought. The management is out of touch. COVID could have been worse. The broader market could have sold off, offsetting anything $GME did (and probably making sentiment even worse). \n6. I believe at $30-$40 the core business is reasonably priced and the value thesis is proved out. There are other stories (short squeeze and the business transformation) that remain. IMO these are far less certain, but in this market a good story might be worth $100. \n\n# Charts + comments\n\n[Entering via CCPs](https://preview.redd.it/kyuu2rh4rab61.png?width=2769&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ce9dc1dc310e756ff294b88061557fad2726a50)\n\nI hear about $GME. The business model of buy kids consoles for pennies on the dollar seems lucrative, video game sales in general are good, but COVID + things going digital are big question marks. The stock is up a lot from lows, but only liars buy at the low and sell at the high. Still seems reasonable, I sold weekly $10P (felt good about this).  Put premiums were good (3.6% for 3 days) and I figured I could get write for a couple weeks before being assigned. \n\nAlso, picked up some 1/15/21 $30C (retard FOMO, I even noted as much \"Getting in w/o doing full research based on Burry and Ryan Cohen + extremely high short interest. Very speculative at this point. Console refresh upcoming + GME while not vibrant is healthy balance sheet wise\").\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Assigned...

Down 3-ish%. No worries, I'll collect more of that sweet premium w/ CCs at $10. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[MSFT News hits](https://preview.redd.it/8x1iv0kesab61.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=791ec4aec2a3929bc6622a3427539f11c6a0c42a)\n\nMSFT news released. No real details. Some people are mocking it saying it is just an agreement to buy MSFT products. Yeah, that's one way to read it. (We're 3 months past this date and still don't know the specifics...). Missed a 40% jump that settled around 20%. The wheel gave me a 7% return instead. $30C bounced up. Continue to do option writing strategies (purchasing for CCs or near the money Puts). Unsure whether I'm being an idiot and should just go long, but things feel speculative and I like the idea of generating returns now (even lower) to buffer against the downside. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3jtvwmdgtab61.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be9dea874271eef7c638f105e7d4d85603836579\n\nWe rocket again! Can't even remember their being news. Shorts are getting squeezed for sure. I'm missing out.  I buy 1000 shares at $15.06. I kind of feel retarded so I hedge it by selling CCs against half the position. Weekly at first, but then $16C 6 weeks out. \n\n$30C still have massive bid/ask spreads but have gone up nicely (150%)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d11ov8twuab61.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c822ab096d7312bde938adfac6de41ed6ffe2b16\n\nJesus fucking Christ. So glad I sold those longer dated CC, but still took a bath. Really wondering if I'm just an idiot buying in at the top. I also really start considering longer dated $10 Puts (20% for 2 months was available), but pussy out. \n\nI dump the $30C as well on the way down ($1k profit off a $1k position)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d1lkmd59vab61.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=123b123f3eecde3f236e7d29db7f716b1c65cc4a\n\nCohen sends a letter to the board.

Intense FOMO. Feeling like an idiot for not buying when things went back to \\~10. I'm doing the exact opposite of what you're supposed to do. A week ago I thought $GME was shit. Now I want to back up the truck... I held off buying at $13 (It'll pull back), $14, $15 (c'mon). I finally buy at 500 shares @ $16.01, 300 shares at $17.22, 700 more at $19.10. Watching this run up while holding a small position is ruining my Thanksgiving holiday...\n\nFeeling like a sucker I hedge w/ CC's. IV is thru the roof going into the Earnings call. I expect some detail on the MSFT deal. Hopefully the terms they got were good. Ideally they talk about similar deals w/ Sony and Nintendo (They got Reggie on the board, that's got to be a layup, right?). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Sherman gives a terrible CC](https://preview.redd.it/o8xq3fmiwab61.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d93203eea9a8e1a1ed17f6087cffaa7f22e3dd9)\n\nJesus. The numbers weren't that bad, but it'd be hard to shit the bed more if he tried. \n\n\\- No earnings guidance\n\n\\- No partnership deal details\n\n\\- $100M in possible share dilution via a Shelf offering. \n\n\\- No discussion of Cohen or other large holders who have presented suggestions for a turnaround (but we got \"Omnichannel\" boys!)\n\nI go from feeling like a moron for not having more to feeling dumb for holding any of this POS. How is this stock going to go up when the management has its head up its ass? I'm fucked. Holiday #s are the next big news item and these idiots will downplay them. Fuck.

He had a low enough cost basis to make a good profit.  He re-affirms and ups his share. \ud83d\ude80 back on the menu. Why don't I have more of this? I missed another golden opportunity...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Random drop](https://preview.redd.it/u398ihwbzab61.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce4aa76f4c7b0fb3dd3cd19cb6b7a14fb81f8de5)\n\nI sold some CCPs near the top, pretty far out of the money. Would have been assigned at $18. Instead, I close the position for a small profit on the premium, don't want to up my $GME holdings. Already feels like too much exposure. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Yesterday](https://preview.redd.it/4x2txed31bb61.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d3202709646cdffdf214d4747df21903d128db7)\n\nCohen and the board were added Monday. Mild move up (10%). TBH I'd barely processed that news when the 60%+ day occurred. \n\nI had 1500 shares w/ only 3 CC's written against them. Proceeded to sell CC's (8 contracts) at $25, $26, $29. I was expecting the move to stop at 15-30%. Obviously misjudged that but that's been my experience. I also really wanted to do the smart thing for once and take profits (relax, not selling shares, just writing contracts) on the upswing vs my normal retarded MO of buying high hoping to sell higher. \n\nWas eye-balling selling the $40C when it hit 600IV ($6 premium for 3 days...), but by that point I was so gunshy (every call I'd written to that point was blown by) and convinced this was going to infinity. I'm resisting the urge to buy, but its hard. Instead I sold some CCP's at $15k worth of $25 (4% return over 3 days). Those 1/15/21 $30C, even w/ massive theta decay, are selling for 3X what I got. \n\nAs confident as the market re-affirming my beliefs makes me $GME still isn't turning a profit yet. Details around the turnaround are scarce. I'll ride it up since my cost-basis is much lower, but I think I missed the opportunity for obscene gains.",

        "selftext": "Hi there, r/stocks!  \n\n\nA bit of a background: I'm a 27 year old, with a job that provides for my daily income. I recently \"woke up\" to realize that I need to invest the money that's just sitting idle in my bank account, especially since I do not need that much cash right now. So, I decided to invest some of my existing savings in the stock market for the **long term** (buy-and-hold, I'm in no hurry to make gains). This was my **first ever investment**, so I am quite the newbie. I'm hoping to invest a total of around $40,000-$50,000 this year.\n\nNow, a few days ago, I bought stocks worth a total of around **$25,000**, largely in ETFs, **all together**. These are the investments:\n\n1. MSFT: $4k (at around $214)\n2. VGT: $4k (at around $353)\n3. QQQ: $4k (at around $314)\n4. ARKK: $3k (at around $139)\n5. ARKF: $3k (at around $51)\n6. PBW: $3k (at around $123)\n7. ARKG: $2k (at around $106)\n8. ICLN: $2k (at around $126)\n\nI'm now having some second thoughts, and would be grateful to have some of your more qualified opinions on the same:\n\n* Did I make a mistake by investing $25k altogether? I didn't know about DCA (dollar cost averaging) until after I finished buying (sounds stupid, and it is). The reason I'm nervous is because there are opinions that suggest the market is at an all-time high &amp; will pullback massively soon. OTOH, my portfolio looks \"balanced\" &amp; low-risk, but again, I'm not sure. To reiterate, I don't need the $25k cash &amp; am perfectly okay with investing it altogether, *if* the investments make sense.\n* If this is a mistake, how can I fix it? Should I just sell off half my holdings, evenly across the board, and then DCA for the rest of the year?\n* Or, should I keep the safer bets (MSFT, QQQ, VGT) and sell off just the riskier ones (ARK, PBW, ICLN)?\n* Alternatively, should I just hold on, given that I'm here for the long-term?\n\nThank you for reading, and I look forward to learning from you awesome people!",

        "selftext": "Hello all, today I present to you a Toronto-based company in the form of Converge Technology Solutions. Before I get started, I just wanted to bring to light a type of bias that may show prevalence. If you have heard of this company before and are already thinking of investing, read the definition of confirmation bias: \u201ctendency to interpret new evidence as confirmation of one's existing beliefs or theories.\u201d Read through the next paragraphs with a neutral mind, free from bias, I present a devil\u2019s advocate argument at the end to subside the rest of the information. Confirmation bias is definitely prevalent on any subreddit, so be careful! \n\n**Who is Converge Technology Solutions?** \n\nBest represented by their own description: \n\nConverge Technology Solutions Corp. is a North American Hybrid IT Solution Provider focused on delivering industry leading solutions and services. Converge\u2019s regional sales and services organizations deliver advanced analytics, cloud, cybersecurity, and managed services offerings to clients across various industries.\n\nConverge supports these solutions with talent expertise and digital infrastructure offerings across all major IT vendors in the marketplace. This multi-faceted approach enables Converge to address the unique business and technology requirements for all clients in the public and private sectors. \n\nThe company has 71, not to be confused later with 17, Strategic Alliances with software, hardware and general programs that are offered by companies around the globe. Some include: Gold Microsoft Partner, Titanium Dell Technologies Partner, and Advanced Amazon Web Services Partner. \n\n**Traded on:** \n\n1. TSX Venture Exchange: CTS.V\n2. OTCQX (Highest OTC exchange): CTSDF\n3. Frankfurt Stock Exchange: 0ZB \n\n**Family of Converge Technology Solutions** \n\nSince October 2019, CTS has acquired 17 companies. This is huge, CTS\u2019s operation seems to be acquiring different IT companies focusing in on Cloud, Cybersecurity, Digital Infrastructure, etc. and forming the companies into an arm of CTS for offering leading-tech solutions in the software industry: \n\n1. **Corus360** \u2013 Cloud, Dad Center, Talent Solutions \n2. **Norther** **Micro** \u2013 AI &amp; Advanced Analytics, Cybersecurity, Cloud &amp; Edge computing \n3. **Becker**\\-**Carroll** \u2013 Strategy &amp; Planning, Design \n4. **KeyInfo** \u2013 Computing, Storage &amp; Networking solutions \n5. **BlueChipTek** \u2013 Hybrid Cloud, Global Logistics, Full Rack Integration \n6. **Light** **House** **Computer** **Services** \u2013 Analytics, Hybrid Cloud, Infrastructure, Security \n7. **SIS** \u2013 Managed Cloud, IaaS, Data Protection \n8. **NSI** \u2013 Data Center, Cloud Security, Enterprise Mobility Solutions \n9. **EssexTec** \u2013 Cloud, Cognitive, Cyber Security \n10. **DataTrend** \u2013 Data Center, Cloud \n11. **VSS** \u2013 Managed Services, Portfolio Management &amp; Services \n12. **PCD** \u2013 Virtualization &amp; Cloud, BC/DR, Enterprise Architecture \n13. **Unique** **Digital** \u2013 Infrastructure Implementation &amp; Support \n14. **Workgroup** **Connections** \u2013 Cloud, Software Development, Licensing, Consulting \n15. **Vivvo** \u2013 Identity Management, Vivvo Trust Platform \n16. **Vicom** \u2013 Full-service Multi-cloud infrastructure \n17. **CarpeDatum** \u2013 Analytics, AI, Performance Management \n\n**Public Recurring Revenues for each Subsidiary;** \n\nFound only 6 of their 17 acquisitions:\n\n1. **EssexTec** \u2013 $52 Million \n2. **VSS** \u2013 $80 million (USD)\n3. **Unique** **Digital** \u2013 $70 million \n4. **Workgroup** **Connections** \u2013 $14.7 Million \n5. **Vivvo** \u2013 $1.85 Million \n6. **CarpeDatum** \u2013 $6.7 Million \n\nThese acquisitions of substantial revenues will add to the portfolio of CTS; obviously, there are other financial aspects to consider such as EBITDA, Goodwill (synergy, etc.) of each transaction to see if it adds benefits. Other considerations, qualitatively, would be to look at each of the company\u2019s specialty and understand that each one of these 17 acquisitions brings in management experience, growth to the global network, and brand extension. Each one of these acquisitions will feature \u201cA Converge Company\u201d underneath their logo to show their presence within the broader network! \n\nMore info on what each of these companies do can be found here: https://convergetp.com/portfolio-of-companies/ \n\n**Current Financials:**\n\nAll data is from their most recent filing of 9-months ended September 30, 2020:  \n\n1. **Revenue:**\n   1. 39% Increase to $659,242,000 from $473,090,000 (Dec31,2019).\n      1. Mostly attributed to by the acquisitions of DataTrend, EssexTec, VSS, and PCD. \n   2. Allocation of Revenue:\n      1. Where does CTS do most of it\u2019s business?\n      2. **Banking &amp; Financial Services** \u2013 21% (Prior Year \u2013 19%)\n      3. **Technology** **Companies** \u2013 19% (Prior Year \u2013 17%)\n      4. **Government** **Contracts** \u2013 19% (Prior Year \u2013 15%)\n      5. **Healthcare** \u2013 16% (Prior Year \u2013 25%)\n      6. **Other** \u2013 25% (Prior Year \u2013 24%)\n2. **Gross Profit:**\n   1. 50% increase to $162,079,000 from $108,234,000 (Dec31,2019). \n      1. Increased drastically due to management\u2019s priority to sell high-margin software and cloud services to maximize net income. \n3. **Market Capitalization (As of 1/15/2020)**\n   1. CAD$ = 870.496M \n   2. Price: 6.31. \n   3. Outstanding Shares \u2013 168,144,125 (as of 1/15/2021)\n      1. As of 9/30/2020 \u2013 Approx. 130,000,000. - Increase of almost 40M shares. \n      2. This will be addressed in the \u201cDevil\u2019s Advocate\u201d Section. \n\n**Future Opportunities &amp; Growth** \n\nAs we all know, we as a collective, are in the midst of a global pandemic with most countries currently in lockdown and implementing stay-at-home orders. This improves the case for work-from-home (WFH) becoming more prevalent. This is one of the key growth drivers for Converge Technology Solutions and will continue to be as large companies around the globe have already mentioned to their employees that in the future WFH will be more flexible and even in some cases companies will have closed their offices as they see their efficiency can be matched by working remotely. The recent acquisitions, and the planned acquisitions ahead will drive revenues and bring qualitative benefits for years to come. \n\n**TSX Up-listing** \n\nAs I previously mentioned, Converge Technology Solutions is currently traded on the TSX Venture Exchange which in basic terms is the junior exchange to the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). \n\nIn a news release on November 19th, 2020 the company stated that it has received conditional approval from the TSX to graduate from the TSXV to list the company\u2019s common shares on the TSX. The final approval of the TSX listing is subject to Converge Fulfilling certain standard and customary conditions required by the TSX on or before February 17th 2021. CTS is very confident it will satisfy all the conditions and further communicate to investors about the process. \n\nThis is a large opportunity to take advantage of as institutional investors may start to get on-board with the up-listing as 0.74% of all outstanding shares are being held by institutions. Similarly, insiders hold a relatively high % of outstanding shares at 15.47%. \n\nSpeculation: With the up-listing to the TSX, this may show further opportunity to cross-list their security on any US-exchanges such as NASDAQ, NYSE, etc. \n\n**Devil\u2019s Advocate** \n\nIn order to subside all the positive information above, I must bring to light something that may concern others moving forward. This topic has to do with **Dilution** and the increasing number of common shares over the past year or so. Public offerings (closing date) include: \n\n1. **February 20, 2020** \u2013 Approx. 6,000,000 shares. \n2. **July 31, 2020** \u2013 Approx. 10,800,000 shares. \n   1. Proceeds: $17.5 million. \n3. **September 30, 2020** \u2013 Approx. 14,650,000 shares. \n   1. Proceeds: $30.0 million. \n4. **January 15, 2020** \u2013 Approx. 17,825,000 shares. \n   1. Proceeds: $86 million. \n\nIn a previous section above, I highlighted the increase in common shares within the Financials section. The company continues to publicly offer shares in order to raise capital to fund its acquisitions. This allows the company to gain cash in order to fulfill its obligations; however, investors may be torn whether to invest or not because when they publicly offer their shares to underwriters, they list a price well below the current market price and this causes people to panic or even scare potential investors away. The increase in the common shares dilutes each individual share so it decreases in value proportionately to how many shares were offered. \n\n**Summary** \n\nAll in all, with the presented information above, Converge Technology Solutions as a company is a huge buying opportunity for investors to take advantage of, the share price has been on an upward trajectory for the past year and I believe this will continue with the future catalysts of TSX up-listing and future acquisitions. Dilution remains present in the eyes of investors but it\u2019s definitely a growing pain; the funds are actively being used to grow the business and the stock price has never been set back with the constant public offerings. Converge\u2019s growing family network of 17 companies will continue to grow in the near and far future. \n\n**Disclosure**\n\nTo be fully transparent, I am an active investor in CTS.V on the TSXV. I will not disclose how many shares or the share price in which I acquired my shares but know that I have been adding to my position on dips for the past month, the dips that happened this week I took advantage of and added to my positions confidently. \n\nThanks for reading! I really enjoy understanding companies in-depth and being passionate about what I am invested in so know that this post was created out of sheer passion and not for any other gains! Please provide me some feedback on what to include/not to include in my future DD posts, this is my second DD post so check out my profile for the first one! &lt;3",

        "selftext": "To understand how stocks move, first, you gotta understand the interaction between buyers and sellers. Basically, it's Econ-101 supply and demand. Too much demand? Buyers will have to raise their prices so that sellers sell.\n\nSecond, the types of market participants. Active and passive participants.\n\nPassive participants are like, buy buy sell buy sell buy sell buy buy buy sell buy sell sell buy. This is almost completely automated and determined by the weighting of the stock versus the index or the methodology that it is following.\n\nThe bots of VOO, for example, doesn't give a damn if an accounting scandal has happened or if a new breakthrough has been reached. Every day, it will buy and sell stocks indiscriminately, following the algos.\n\nAnd increasingly, newer assets under management are coming mostly under those passive investment vehicles such as passive ETFs, passive mutual funds etc leading to them having a larger and larger share of the market. (I am coming to active participants later)\n\nThirdly, you gotta understand hedging. Which is basically an investment position to offset losses. Example, you sell a naked call. You see the stock moving closer to the strike price. You immediately buy shares to ensure that you don't take a loss.\n\n# Ok, now why do individual stocks move?\n\nThey move based on events (plain old news, market-related movements etc). Now, let's go back to active participants such as retail investors, hedge funds, fund managers etc.\n\nSuppose, there's a quarterly earnings report coming out for ASML. Almost all active participants have somehow figured from various news reports that the earnings report will be good because of the huge demand for ASML's product.\n\nAs a result, an active fund manager takes a big position on that stock. The stock moves a bit. Hedge funds and other firms also take their positions.\n\nA retard post about the company's upcoming good earnings on the internet and all early retard investors quickly get in.\n\nThe stock moves up. In the meantime, the passive funds are adjusting their position in the stock, realtime. If it's going up. They are buying more to adjust their position.\n\nNow, don't forget. Those passive ETFs or funds have other semiconductor stocks in their ETFs and shits. Which means, even if only ASMLs quarterly earnings were supposed to be good, other stocks of the same sector will benefit. As there are tons of both active and passive algos that don't trade individual stocks but ETFs and similar stuff due to liquidity reasons.\n\nThis gets even better. Suppose, lots of retail investors are also buying call options of this stock. If the underlying continues to go up, the delta could keep on rising. Suppose it went from 5% to 10% to 20%. This would force the option sellers to keep on buying more and more shares and could lead to gamma explosion where the market makers create a violent feedback loop due to hedging.\n\nIt gets more fun than that. Remember the various HFT firms and scalper bots? Well, they know it all too well that some firms are busy at hedging frenzy. They also join in on the feeding frenzy that is this stock.\n\nAfter said earnings release(or most likely, just before it), most of the active participants like retail traders and hedge funds may well start taking profits. And the stock generally runs up more than the expected in the first place.\n\nThis leads to the violent unwinding of the positions that we generally see after the earnings release. Because everything happens in the exact reverse order I just described here. That's why it's a terrible gamble to buy options in hope of a good earnings release or similar news.\n\nIt feels euphoric if you are on the right side of the tide and equally depressing if you are on the wrong side of the tide.\n\nThe same thing can happen in the opposite direction if a piece of bad news is expected or happens.\n\nHere, earnings release is just one of the events that I described. It could be any event like index inclusion, regulatory shifts, stock splits, analyst upgrade-downgrades, some fund manager or hedge funds buying the stock etc.\n\nAlso, don't forget that all this is also affecting other stocks in the same sector/region etc due to them being connected through passive investments and active participants exploiting the passive participants.\n\nA very recent example of this happening would be the stock PLTR. Remember, they signed a contract with FDA for $44M but the stock moved almost $10B or more(I haven't calculated) or about 20%. Two weeks ago maybe, Citron declared short attack and a violent unwinding of positions happened and the stock went down about 15-20% after climbing 10-12% that day. Or the day before that when it climbed 20%+.\n\nNow I have sold calls on PLTR (yeah, I like it that your 12/04, 12/11, 12/18 expired or will expire worthless).\n\n**This is not how all stocks move.**\n\nBut a large portion of the stocks that are mentioned here in the sub move this way. This is why it sometimes feels like to you folks as KINDA pump and dump. But whether you retards accept it or not I know you guys are the cream of the crop. While most of you act as if you know nothing, I know very well most of you probably make money.\n\nYou guys are like people who watch tech reviews to buy a smartphone.\n\nOk, I completely went out of topic. Sorry.\n\n**This is not how all stocks move.**\n\nSome boomer stocks like MMM, JBT etc may have low retail interest. In those cases, the stocks are almost absolutely up to the mercy of other active participants, who or which may as well not care that much leaving those stocks to the hands of the algos of passive participants.\n\nBut in those whole processes, there's almost no price discovery that's actually working. Passive algos are buying and selling (but mostly creating buying pressure) completely arbitrarily, HFT bots buying and selling because, reasons.\n\nThe participants who are using traditional valuation metrics, analyzing the good and bad of stocks are getting outnumbered by all the other participants and generally speaking, the volume of their trades are also declining in the overall market. Think of big participants like Berkshire(which is undoubtedly the most powerful active participant in the market), pension funds, sovereign funds etc, they barely buy or sell any stocks they have if they have entered on the right price.\n\nSure, I am kinda underselling the influence of big institutional investors, but it is not completely without any merit.\n\n**So you are saying there's no price discovery in the various stocks?**\n\nAbsolutely not. Even in the greatly flawed system I described being used by most market participants there's plenty of it happening by newsflashes, sell-side analyst recommendations, retail fomoers etc.\n\nOnly the stocks that have heavy institutional ownerships, with a healthy retail interest seems to me to be less volatile(this is my intuition speaking really, so this statement is probably false in the first place) such as MSFT etc and they probably have better price discovery.\n\n**What about those stocks doubling the day they IPO?**\n\nThe reason behind that is very simple. Tons of retail investors place Market Orders. This means they are ready to pay whatever the price this thing will go for. In those scenarios, investment banks can hardly control the price of the stock as there's just too much demand to satisfy. In short, it's a feeding frenzy. And this is one of the things that's primarily driven by retail interest.\n\n**What about those SPACs and low-float stocks?**\n\nWell, this again needs no explaining. Too low float, too much interest. Various whales also know this and use this for their benefit. After the merger is complete(or slightly before it) retail investors and whales leave for the next thing in the line. So the stock tanks and the stock price never recovers.\n\nIf the company that's being pumped is actually any good, the stock would likely later get the attention it deserves after the sell-off.\n\nI hope all those points are good enough to explain most of the funky behaviour an individual stock would make. I know my explanations are not exhaustive and there are many angles I haven't covered, but it is what it is.\n\nNow, to the MORE IMPORTANT STUFF. Individual stocks also move due to numerous macro reasons. When the entire market is in a euphoric phase, you can throw a dart and that stock would move up. The opposite and the stock would go down.\n\n# Why and how does the market move?\n\nLiquidity. This is probably the most important thing that drives the market as a whole.\n\nExcess liquidity that's circling around will inevitably try to enter into the economy in one way or another. Either through purchasing more assets or any other way.\n\nNow, we all know it pretty well that this trend is being exaggerated by the low-interest-rate environment that's present in the current developed markets. People are being forced to participate in the market in the hunt for return.\n\nAlso, almost every investor from every country seems to be more interested to participate in the US stock market, even more than their home markets. And the recent trend of commission-free brokerage services and easy flow of capital has helped to provide even more participation in the stock market than usual.\n\nOptions trading is also at historic highs and probably most of you buy call options and put options is probably mostly bought by institutional investors(like it always were). As a whole, this frenzy can move the market very quickly.\n\nRemember, SoftBank bought billions in options on very concentrated tech names? That along with retail call options purchasing mania lead the market to a euphoric state. The S&amp;P 500 has become so heavily influenced by those tech names that if they move, the entire market moves. If they fall, the entire market falls.\n\nBut we haven't probably addressed a big elephant in the room. Volatility suppression.\n\nFutures traders, algos, our central bank etc all are participating in the dangerous game of volatility suppression. \n\nThis all can unwind though. And it can unwind fairly quickly.\n\nIf we take the case of February or March. If you remember, Mr Ackman was screaming fire, fire, fire(he have had his intentions) but the market was barely paying attention.\n\nBut with the lockdowns and everything, suddenly everyone seems to have gotten caught with their pants down.\n\nAnd you know how quick all the things were. Active investors, retail investors everyone suddenly flocked for put options, VIX etc. A Minsky moment has suddenly come.\n\nMargin calls, longs are burnt left and right, market makers have completely turned their positions etc, you know the usual deal but exactly in the opposite direction.\n\nSuddenly gold, treasuries, cryptos etc whatever are being sold to cover their positions. Institutional investors are suddenly visited by their risk managements and they suddenly become net sellers.\n\nPassive investments vehicles also sell stocks that are being kicked heavily.\n\nLiterally, everyone's a seller. No one wants to buy. And the situation doesn't change until the Fed comes in and says, \"Brrrr\".\n\nLiquidity suddenly becomes available in the debt market. Retail investors jump. Buy the dip, they said. Money keeps flowing in from everywhere.\n\nThere are many other things that I probably needed to say to complete the story. But it is what it is.\n\nAlso, interest rate trumps over everything. Every valuation metrics, pricing schemes are dependent on it. So that's super important.\n\nLet's say suddenly interest rates rise the market will immediately collapse along with your meme stock. Because of two main reasons. Every company is loaded with debt and the risk free return has just increased resulting in more money chasing treasury bonds and other instruments.\n\n# These pieces of information any useful?\n\nYes and no. As they say, hindsight is always 20/20.\n\nLet me tell you my short story navigating the market this year.\n\nFebruary. News of the virus and everything. I see VIX, S&amp;P, bond market, foreign markets etc and I keep sucking my thumb thinking nothing's going to happen. Being burnt by two trades and market starting to freefall almost. I realize my mistake and change my strategy.\n\nFed says, \"Brrr\". I fail to change my strategy. Something even worse could be coming. Lol. After almost a week passing I realise my f\\*\\*\\*ing mistake. Again. At least I can say it's not just me.\n\nThe information is almost always there. Problem is we(not everyone of course, some of you are much more flexible) fail to act upon it. \n\nOk, one more story about an individual stock.\n\nRemember AAPL's third-quarter earnings result? I sold calls before earnings thinking the stock will go down after earnings report.\n\nThere was overwhelming evidence that this is not going to be true. And I read almost all of it (WFH and everything). Yet my monkey brain somehow decided to trust the analyst estimates and the overall news cycle surrounding the economy.\n\nAAPL then reported a literal blow away quarterly earnings report.\n\nFor me 2020 was a year of reckoning and I learned to remove my directional assumption from the market and to just go with the flow. But I am pretty sure it wouldn't matter, cause when it's time, I just wouldn't remember.\n\nI posted this one before but it got removed by votebots.",

        "selftext": "I got two goals here. One is for you to understand what Salesforce and SAP really do instead of just \"cloud\" and \"software\" and why Salesforce will become like SAP. The second is to tell you what to expect with CRM price and how to make tendies.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst you gotta understand what exactly SAP does and what happened with their stock. SAP is one of the largest software companies which focus on ERP. What the fuck is ERP you might ask? ERP is what other businesses use to track business resources. This ranges from everything such as planning and optimizing manufacturing capacity to dealing with payroll for employees. Basically companies don't want to create their own software for handling these wide range of tasks and pay SAP a shit load of money to do it for them. Where's the problem you might ask? Unless you are involved with one of these companies that use SAP, it's difficult to understand what the experience is like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/htsfvr8uro861.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db3b665c95ce5d62639a4dc0e5d9469a08510cbd\n\nBasically a company pays SAP to use their software for dealing with one of these areas of ERP. This generally works fine since SAP has used their business management software with a lot of companies for the same tasks. The issue is when one of these companies want to [customize the software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning#Disadvantages) to meet unique demands for the company. This re-engineering process to fit the ERP system for many tasks ends up costing more for a company and wasting a lot of time and money. Interestingly enough, you can ask almost any business about their experience with SAP and they will all say that they're unhappy even though they use their software. So what you might ask, wouldn't SAP still be generating tons of revenue? Well yes but more of these companies are moving away from this way of doing ERP as it is an inflexible approach. This is becoming replaced by more loosely connected systems utilizing cloud instead of having a one solves all solution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ugj07ez0to861.png?width=984&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c45c19bcdd0e10bd643286730aa3a2beeec0ae20\n\nLet's look at how their financial earnings and stock price have reflected this. In the past two years this stock has traded relatively sideways with some really bad drops. Around May to August their stock price went up 60% do to the hype around cloud companies benefiting from COVID. However it has obviously taken a really bad fall when October earnings were announced. They claimed that there was slower recovery than anticipated for many of its clients. However I suspect that many of these companies have been looking to shift away from SAP as the pandemic has shown the importance of the flexibility of these systems. By looking at their past quarters, you can see that their quarterly revenue has been flat around the 8 billion range and the company is clearly having a difficult time changing their business model. Other cloud companies are replacing their solutions as SAP's clients move away from their software even though SAP is trying to shift to [modern cloud technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP#Corporate_restructuring). Generally though companies have a hard time changing their business approach from the old way of doing things to the new way of doing things. \n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow the important part. What the fuck does SAP's troubles have to do with Salesforce. As you may have guessed from the ticker Salesforce provides CRM or customer relationship management. [CRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management) is a specific area in ERP dealing with customer services. For example a company may want a software for their call center or to automate a marketing effort. Salesforce provides software to do this along with analytics of this data so that these businesses can make informed decisions.\n\nAs you may have already guessed Salesforce is facing some similar problems that SAP deal with. When a company decides to expand their CRM software to deal with more parts of their business, the inflexibility and costs quickly become apparent. [For example, many corporations only use CRM systems on a partial basis and less than 40 percent of companies have high end-user adoption rates.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management#Criticism) Again if you are not familiar with software development and companies using these software vendors it is difficult to fully understand these troubles. I would strongly recommend researching the issues of customizing ERP or CRM software for a specific company if you are not convinced. While Salesforce tries to provide an all in one solution for their clients, customization becomes complicated and prices become costly. These customizations become difficult to do and take a lot of time, planning, and money. Companies are becoming more inclined to take a different approach for building these systems. In a lot of these cases it is easier for a business to build their own system in the cloud using products from companies such as Microsoft or Amazon for more customizability. \n\nAnother big issue is the concern over customer data with CRM systems. A company might opt to develop their own CRM systems where they can ensure that customer data is obeying customer privacy laws and allows them to have more control over private data. This can help build a better relationship with the customer. Privacy issues over customer data has obviously become a big issue in 2020.\n\nFurthermore, Salesforce has been trying to get into more areas with [recent acquisitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salesforce). Similar to SAP, I suspect that Salesforce will crush over their own weight as they try to expand their company. One good example of this is their recent acquisition of Slack. Slack does not really fit any of Salesforce ecosystem and is really just an attempt to expand into a different area. Slack has a lot of competition from Microsoft teams and other companies which can do what Slack does but better. \n\nBusiness will start to move away from Salesforce similar to SAP. This is not to say that they be completely independent as Salesforce does make some parts of the businesses easier. However there seems to be a strong resemblance to SAP based on what I know from inside of a corporation using both SAP and Salesforce and the many issues they face when they try and customize their solutions.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo how can we use this information to print tendies? The expectation is that Salesforce will eventually slow their growth down while stock is overhyped due to being a cloud company and start to fall or go sideways like SAP. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vl629rb14p861.png?width=927&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4282ffef17bd83b9a62a7f196974d0113511b1d5\n\nBasically the idea is to try and play puts, especially around earnings. If Salesforce misses their guidance then it could the stock in a serious reversal especially for a cloud company with a lot of hype. The next earnings will be early March.\n\nYou can also try and play longer term puts but the stock is fairly volatile like SAP and I would only do this if you see the price go up significantly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr; buy puts in march \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclosure: long on GME \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "https://investor.fitbit.com/press/press-releases/press-release-details/2019/Fitbit-to-Be-Acquired-by-Google/default.aspx\n\nThe above is over a year old. So what is Fitbit, and why am I posting this now, then?\n\n\nFitbit is an American electronics and fitness company which focuses on health-related metrics, tracking, and data analysis. For you, what you need to know is that it sells smartwatches. \n\nAnyone who cares about watches or fashion at all, you might have heard of Fitbit. As someone who used to be big on high fashion about 2-3 years ago, Moncler was a suave yet not over-the-top brand that a lot of rich Asians and Khabib Nurmagomedov wore. https://i.imgur.com/tiONi3I.jpg. Personally for me, Fitbit has a lot of resemblance - popular enough for the cool kids wear and know, and still good for the boomers due to the functionality. \n\n\nFitbit is ranked 5th worldwide in shipments for watches, behind notably Apple, Samsung, and Xiaomi. https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS46122120\n\n\nBack in 2019, some of you boomers here might recall an announcement by Google, with plans to acquire Fitbit at a 2.1 Billion dollar USD transaction, which was halted by various legislative and activist communities due to the ongoing battle vs. FAANG+M (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, GOOG(Alphabet) + Microsoft). See: Facebook vs. US of A currently. Let me give you the spoilers on this stuff for the upcoming Biden Administration and the near future: it doesn't matter. \n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22158271/googles-fitbit-deal-eu-regulator-approval\n\n\nBig techs rule the world, that's why they are boomer stocks at this point, that's why they are blue chips. Stonks only go up? None of this exists to today without the big tech companies starting the trend and movement into this digital era, into this technological boom. Your teachers use Google to find their sources despite telling to you keep your nose in the books. Your very own senators representatives and law-makers, voting about the 25th Amendment, revisit the constitution thru Google, while actively voting against big-techs taking over the world, using... Google. \n\n\nThe very same Google is bent on acquiring Fitbit, and has received a conditional-yet-final approval from the EU commission, and will be soon to follow in the USA, I presume not long after the transition of power on the 20th. Google will acquire Fitbit due to their previous failure to breach into the smartwatches market, which exploded some ~4-5 years ago. Apple currently dominates the market, and Google wants a piece. Do you think Google will sit by idly and watch one of their prime competitors claim the throne without contest?\n\n\nGoogle recently filed a patent for a smartwatch-design which includes a heartrate tracker. It's very unlikely that after their past attempts at breaking into the watches market, that they will go ahead and just, \"TrY aGaIn\" without the proper measures taken. Fitbit is that proper measure, it's the acquisition which will get them the entry footing they need, to grow. https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-fitness-band-design-revealed-uspto/\n\n\nBut the biggest reason why I'm in Fitbit right now, is because it's a tech-involved product maker coming out of the COVID pandemic, consistently beating earnings expectations for the last 2 quarters of the pandemic, about to report yet another earnings in... ~3 weeks, speculated 1st/2nd week of February. Premiums are beyond dirt cheap also, the stock's been sideways for a year since Google's acquisition announcement over a year ago. Get in before the holiday earnings in early February.\n\n\n**TL;DR**\n- $FIT is a watch company being acquired by Google, after long halts from various legislators and committees.\n- Earnings are coming up, have consistently been beat during the pandemic, smart watch market grew ~80% YOY in 2019 and Fitbit's revenues grew during pandemic.\n- Premiums are dirt cheap, stock has long to run. If $PTON can grow into 2021, $FIT will certainly rise from the ashes.\n\n**EDIT**\n\nPOSITIONS:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/x0x2mYb\n\nDown on all, been in for over a month on all of them, some longer. Will be burnt for January calls. Time your calls to the ides of February or after - earnings are definitely not priced in.\n\nAdding some rockets for WSB literacy - \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "Bill Foley (Chairman of Fidelity National Financial and Black Knight; Owner of NHL Team: Vegas Golden Knights) has announced an acquisition in fintech.\n\nFoley has been involved in more than 100 acquisitions and many spinoffs. His success stories include Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Life, which he took over in 1984 and made into a Fortune 500 company, Black Knight, Dun &amp; Bradstreet, and Foley Family Wines.\n\nFoley\u2019s SPAC (BFT) is acquiring Paysafe.\n\nPaysafe handles the gaming dollar volume for Fortnite and Twitch.

That translates to around $21 upon completion of the acquisition. The upside is easily $40+ and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the shares traded for around $100 in the next 2-3 years. Long BFT",

        "selftext": "Just wanted to share my research on VIH (Bakkt) since I hadn't seen one and a few comments I had seen about it were misinformed ones. I have learnt a lot from this subreddit over the last year and wanted to give something back.\n\n**What is Bakkt?**\n\nBakkt is a digital asset marketplace founded in August 2018 that lets you trade bitcoin, trade bitcoin futures, peer to peer bitcoin transfer, peer to peer cash transfer, earn and spend reward points, convert reward points to cash and also use it with another merchant (think using airline miles for coffee in starbucks, or using delta airmiles for american airlines)  and stocks/options.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n03wpv1hutb61.png?width=2962&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aed8da9746fbc1dc70c2fae7cc57adf9835eb173\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Notable leadership:**\n\nGavin Michael is their new CEO. He was the head of technology at Citi Bank for four years before this. He was also Head of Digital at Chase from 2013 to 2016.\n\nAdam White is President. He was general manager and vice-president at Coinbase before he joined Bakkt in 2018.\n\nNicolas Cabrera is CPO. His previous notable roles were  co-founder and SVP Product at OneMarket (Westfield Labs)  from 2012 to 2019. He was also lead on product and digital for eBay and PayPal in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nAkshay Nehata of Softbank and Jeff Sprecher CEO of ICE sit on the board as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\"I have never heard of Bakkt\"**\n\nThe app is invite only currently with around 100,000+ active users. This is the reason why most of us have never heard of it. They have been building institutional relationships until now to allow them to offer all of the above services.  They plan full-scale rollout of the app in Q1 2021.\n\nRegarding bitcoin exchange so far they have been buying and storing bitcoin for big institutional players think microstrategy etc. ( I don't know which companies have used them to date).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What is their moat?**\n\nI think their moat at this point will be the rewards program points, the seamless aggregation of all the digital assets and the liquidity it offers across all this. Being able to use rewards points across merchants and platform will be huge for your everyday consumer whose award points across different merchants just sit around until they go and use the same company all over again. This together with all the other services that you will be able to get on just one app can be a game changer. Think cashapp+ chicago mercantile exchange+ robinhood+ rewards points transfer under one roof.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dboqfaaawtb61.png?width=3095&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b20ddfd1852e91e5021330ed54b0c3b77b5e1514\n\n**Current partners:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mmplgxd0ytb61.jpg?width=3140&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8fc19de4ca5e9c28939af90f431d8c29dd09ca8\n\n**How do they differentiate from coinbase, gemini, cashapp and paypal for crypto?**\n\nSay you want to buy 1000$ worth of bitcoin. Coinbase/cashapp/gemini will let you buy 985$ worth whereas paypal 982$. Bakkt undercuts them by 0.25% and 0.5% respectively and lets you buy 988$ worth. \n\nCoinbase and gemini  lets you trade other cryptocurrency as well while bakkt at this point does not. They are planning to add other currencies except for XRP (which have been removed from the other two mentioned apps as well).\n\n**Revenue Model:**\n\nI will let the below chart from investor presentation explain. It does it better than I'll be able to in a paragraph.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4qstx5cq2ub61.png?width=3112&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b5e1528846a7f53790632de129aeba313c2805c\n\n**Institutional investors:**\n\nThey have a very impressive group of institutional investors which include ICE, Microsoft, Boston Consulting Group, Starbucks and PayU. ICE owned 81% of the company before merging with VIH and post-merger will hold 65% of the company and they are rolling 100% of their equity stake in the company. In addition they are also investing a further 50 million dollars through PIPE.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c4k3zhnkdub61.png?width=745&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ac311759a184d9499cdbce1256efd977db35c83\n\n**Valuation:**\n\nThey had 300 billion Series B funding in early 2020 with a valuation of 1 billion. Before current merger 880 million had been invested into the company by various players. Current valuation on merger is going to be 2.1 billion dollars. This merger will allow the company to have 524 million dollars cash in hand to accelerate growth (this includes 92 million dollar in cash that is already on bakkt's balance sheet prior to merger). Important thing here is none of the previous investors are selling their stake from what I was able to find unlike other private companies that have gone public with SPACs where the previous investors were cashing in at least part of their previous investment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Revenue  Projections:**\n\nI would take them with a grain of salt as these can be over-optimistic but they have a very high CAGR which is appropriate for the kind of fintech they are.\n\nTheir main competitors in the crypto buy/sell market would be coinbase and gemini but they are undercutting them on costs and this part of the market is still in the very early phases and if they can offer a reliable app then they might capture a lot of it. For those who don't know coinbase crashes every time there are \\~10% fluctuations in a small time so you can't sell even if you want to.\n\nFor the futures market the big names in the US are CME and Binance. Okex is mainly in China. \n\nFor the rewards market their only competitors would be [points.com](https://point.com) who aren't even close to what Bakkt can offer. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gke9suwnjxb61.png?width=3108&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4f31f173ed80b477678be2856a91ba38b4836df\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TAM:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pep9dofo5ub61.png?width=3143&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c3b0fa28690a2c46998784c8d9f91ce18e91c16\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCryptocurrency and digital currency is the future with more and more institutional involvement it is a matter of time before a broader adoption. This will come with time but it is very important to understand this is not the only way Bakkt wants to capture and get a hold in the market.\n\nI think Bakkt went public at this time given the euphoria in general in current stock market as well the cryptocurrency market otherwise they would have waited a year or two before they went public. Going  public now allows them to tap the public market without doing another series of private funding to allow for aggressive marketing and growth. The ongoing active involvement of a big institution like ICE and their 100% rolling of equity to me is bullish and shows their commitment and belief in it. Their CEO  Jeffrey Sprecher has been actively involved in Bakkt's growth and pointed it out for growth in last year's investor call. Having said this Bakkt is a high risk high reward play for post-merger holders as the app is about to rollout and will depend on how quickly they are able to entice users. They have all the right ideas, tools, institutional infrastructure and partnerships but has yet to be executed on a large scale except for the bitcoin futures trading and institutional bitcoin trading which are already ongoing.\n\nBefore merger major catalysts for other traders would be announcement of further major partnerships (apple, major airlines etc) as well as a possible Mad Money Cramer pump as he has already had an exclusive combined interview for CNBC with ICE CEO Sprecher and Bakkt CEO Michael.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This is my limited research into the company please feel free to add or correct something. Invest according to your risk tolerance. I currently hold commons in VIH and planning to hold long-term.",

        "selftext": "This is my first DD so I hope it goes well.\n\nCC Neuberger Principal Holdings I (PCPL) has an agreement to merge with E2OPEN.\n\n**What is E2OPEN?**: E2OPEN is a cloud-based, artificial intelligence, on-demand SaaS platform company. E2OPEN is the largest cloud-based provider of networked supply chain applications. More than 70,000 partner companies and 200,000 users, many of the biggest companies in the world use the E2OPEN network today.\n\n**Who are E2OPEN's customers?**: Some of their customers include Google, Facebook, AMD, Nvidia, Intel, HP, IBM etc. [Complete list taken from the investor presentation.](https://i.imgur.com/FfcVX7o.png)\n\n**Who is leading the SPAC?**: The founder &amp; CEO of PLPC is Chinh Chu. A billionaire with 30+ years of investment experience, including 25 years at [Blackstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blackstone_Group). He has created 3 SPACs since 2016. The first SPAC, CF Corp, raised $1.2 billion and successfully merged with Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Life. The second SPAC, Collier Creek Holdings, raised $475 million and successfully merged with a company in the consumer sector. And now we have his most recent, third SPAC, PCPL. It has raised $414 million and will merge with E2OPEN. This man was also in charge of taking Dun &amp; Bradstreet private in a large $7.2 billion deal. Before joining Blackstone in 1990, this man also worked in the Mergers &amp; Acquisitions Deparment at Salomon Brothers. His experience is undeniable. \n\n**Backstory**: E2OPEN used to be a public company. Their stock price went as high as $28. They were bought by a private company and were taken off the market in 2015. Ever since they were taken private, E2OPEN was able to grow from $80M in revenue 5 years ago to $335M in 2020. They have acquired a handful of companies and continue to do so. E2OPEN's revenue is about four times what it was in 2015. The percent of revenue that is subscription-based, which is always a key metric for a SaaS company, was 80% in fiscal 2020 and is expected to grow in 2021. It also stands to benefit as companies automate their supply chains further in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**The potential negatives:** Their estimated revenue for next year is about +10%. There was an additional funding from instutions through a private investment in public equity (PIPE) of $175M which will be used to pay down existing debt. E2OPEN traded publicly before they were acquired by another company. Their stock price went as high as $28 but also went as low as $8. They were then acquired by Insight Venture Partners and have grown since. \n\n**The Merger**: SPAC shareholders will own 20% of the shares. The merger has a valuation of $2.57B. Upon closing of the transaction with E2OPEN, the ticker will change from 'PCPL' to 'ETWO'.\n\n**TL:DR:** A cloud-based SaaS platform company with customers from some of the biggest corporations in the world today, has a definitive agreement to merge with 'PCPL'. PCPL is run by a billionaire with an unbelievable resume that has already had two previous successful SPAC mergers and this is his third SPAC. The company's revenue has grown massively and their revenue today is about four times higher than it was in 2015. The percent of their revenue that is subscription-based is 80% and is expected to grow in the future. \n\n**Disclaimer:** I own 420 shares of PCPL. Invest at your own risk. As of this writing the price of PCPL is **$10,84.**",

        "selftext": "In early Q1 P-C-P-L is merging with E2open. E2open has disruptive AI / Cloud technology for the supply-chain industry. They are widely used by big name customers including Google, Microsoft, Boeing, Walmart, Coca Cola, UPS, AMD, NVIDIA, Abbott, and dozens of others.\n\nWhat differentiates them from other (more boring) supply chain management companies is the way they use AI to predict changes in supply and demand. Basically, E2open allows companies to see 10 steps ahead into the future to forecast how much inventory they will need based on hundreds of variables (geopolitics, resource availability, etc). This saves companies hundreds of millions in waste. CEO Michael Farlekas  compares it to working at a lemonade stand and being able to know ahead of time exactly how many lemons you will need. Obviously this will save you from wasting money on lemons that would spoil. E2open is the only company that integrates this type of AI technology with a vast data Cloud network.\n\nE2open uses a subscription model to make consistent sustainable revenue from their 1000+ customers. There are multiple services they offfer, but over 50% of their customers only use 1 service. What's nice is that existing customers go on to utilize more and more of their services as they realize the value it adds to their companies. Google for example paid E2open twice as much over the course of 2 years. E2open makes additional revenue from new customers, and also by strategic value-adding acquisitions. The SPAC deal is allowing E2open to clean up their balance sheet so they can add value to their software portfolio (and charge higher premiums to existing customers) and continue making acquisitions.\n\nE2open has been growing at a rapid clip since they were taken private in 2015. In 2015 they made $80M in revenue and in 2020 they made $335M. That's 420% growth in 5 years, or roughly +84% growth per year.\n\nIn the last 5 years they increased their revenue +420% by value-adding acquisitions they've made over the last decade --- Icon (2013), Serus Corp (2014), Terra Technology (2016), Orchestro (2016), Steelwedge (2017), Zyme (2017), Entomo and Birch Worldwide (2018), Inttra (2018), and Amber Road (2018) --- and integrating these different services to create a beautiful comprehensive end-to-end platform.\n\nSomewhat surprisingly, their projections for 2021 are much lower at only +10% estimated revenue growth, which is the main reason most would argue P-C-P-L is trading so close to the NAV. However, 10% growth is actually really solid when you look at their margins and consider that 80% of their revenue is recurring with excellent customer retention. Institutional investors especially will appreciate E2open as the reliable revenue generating machine that it has  become. \n\nI'm also still optimistic about valuing E2open as a growth stock and feel the 10% is a low-ball estimate based on comparisons to the median growth of other supply chain management companies. I'm suspecting E2open will consistently  outperform expectations on a quarterly as the SPAC capital equips them to capitalize on their services, continue making acquisitions, and ultimately tap into millions in white space opportunity.\n\nEven if E2open maintained a 10% growth rate  and if this were factored into its valuation, $11/share is still too damn low. E2open compares itself to Descartes, Kinaxis, Manhattan, and Spscommerce. With a median of 10.7x revenue, E2 was only at 7x, and with a median of 34.7x, E2 was only at 21.3x, meaning E2open has a much higher upside than its peers.\n\nInstitutions will bring the stock price up to par with it's peers and I believe the low ball projected growth is a conservative number that they will completely destroy when you consider their growth of +400% over the last 5 years. While 10% is perfectly fine for a company like E2open, I'm expecting the trend of the last 5 years to continue in 2021 and we'll be seeing some exciting numbers. \n\nMy PT pre-merge is 15 and 25 EOY assuming their projected 10% revenue growth. If E2open surpasses 2021 expected revenue as I'm suspecting and they have major quarterly beats, I'm holding until 50.\n\nDisclaimer: This is my largest position. I'm in 2500 shares at 10.87.",

Well, after a bit more DD, here is what I can say for KTOS.\n\nFirst i'll repeat what the other post said. Recently ARK, Blackrock, Vanguard and Fidelity have bought a huge number of shares in KTOS, and there is a good reason why. I'll link to the original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kvrv7b/cathie_arkbacked_tech_innovator_kratos_defense/) as it will likely be a more interesting read and im not great at formatting. \n\nI thought i'd look into them and I was pretty pleased with what I saw.\n\nI attended the presentation, and this is what I managed to jot down during the presentation. I'm sure it'll look very boring, but maybe for you its worth reading. I was taking these down as I was listening, so there may be gaps in the information.\n\nSignificant invests and won a lot of contracts. Continued investment in 2021 and accelerate in 2022 as these mature to production.\n\n**Primary Areas** - Target drones \u2013 very high in demand. Lots of contacts are for target drones.

Drones get shot down and then replaces, looking to expand domestically and internationally as new drone requirements are needed.\n\no Skyborg contract awarded. LCAAT contract awarded, government announced the Valkyrie flew with the F22 and F35 showing they have drones performing missions.\n\nNext gen engines for drones and cruise missiles \u2013 important announcement made to have another contract for Kratos next gen engine for cruise missiles and drones.\n\n**Unmanned drones** \u2013 Gremlin is reusable, only company with a family of these drones (low cost, 400k to 3m). Force multiplies and they\u2019re the market leaders.\n\no Gremlin \u2013 govt announced they have multiple customers for the gremlin drones for when it transitions from research team at DARPA. Likely moved to 2022/2023 due to covid and earthquake. Nothing else in the Gremlin, Valkyrie class line aside from Kratos.\n\n**Space and satellite communication**\n\no Biggest business in kratos, leading the industry, supporting ~80% space missions.\n\no Thousands of LEO and MEO satellites planned including HBTSS () and TITAN (Tactical Interface Tracking Application Node) program.\n\no Microsoft partnered with musk and starlink, AND kratos.

        "selftext": "I haven't invested since August, and their haven't been any dips in the market since early November. Even then, it was a small dip and the market shot up 800 points or so for the next few days. The market also seems to not be making any sense because every time the unemployment numbers are increasing the market shoots up.\n\nIt's mainly due to injections of liquidity from the fed reserve. But, at some point the house of cards has to fall. A lot of these companies that are going up are IPOs that solely went up because of niche markets that would not have been as big if the coronavirus had not have happened ex: peloton, zoom, some cloud stocks etc. Now it's hard to even find a stock under $100 because the whole market has been overflooded with newby investors, liquidity, and activist hedge funds that are trying to keep retail and manufacturing relevant that is keeping the blue chip stocks propped up as well. \n\nWith that said, at these prices is it still worth it to buy a couple shares of these overvalued firms like Zoom, Netflix, Amazon, Peloton, Tesla etc. \n\nLook for another IPO that may or may not go up? Draft Kings, Air bnb, Snowflake, beyond meat, rackspace, etc\n\nOr just wait it out logically like Buffett used to say in one of speeches be patient and only buy something if you know you can hold it for 10s. However, the more I feel I'm waiting the more I feel like I'm just letting my money sit doing nothing and I'm losing out on opportunity cost. These values just make no sense though, and every IPO that comes out sees even higher percentage gains than the one before it. The regular blue chip stocks that are steady like Microsoft, Visa, Proctor and Gamble, Walmart etc that seem like the best companies profit, revenue, and management wise don't rise up in value near as much as some poorly invested startup IPO in a niche market that has negative earnings every quarter. It just makes no sense. \n\nSo, basically is it still worth it to invest in 2021, or should we all just sit out and wait for it to drop like how much higher can it go?  \nAnd if so what makes for better investments in our current times blue chips that are less worrisome, tech companies, solar/renewables, or IPOs?",

Hundreds of banks have joined the platform since Visa announced its takeover, Zach Perret, CEO and co-founder of Plaid, said in a separate blog post.\u201d\n\nThey were in talks to be acquire by VISA through a $5.3 billion deal but it felt through due to the government\u2019s antitrust concerns. \n\nLet\u2019s make a list of the SPACs that are in the realm of possibility for Plaid.\n\nAfter using the search bar in this sub for Plaid and checking with SPAC watchlist this are the ones I believe could at least have talks.\n\nDue to the connection to Goldman Sachs and their size, I believe GSAH and CRHC have a real chance: GSAH $1.1B, CRHC $860M\n\nThe following are also looking into FinTech and so far no deals or Bloomberg rumors: FUSE $500M, AACQ $985M, LEAP $830M, FTOC $830M. \n\nI don\u2019t believe IPOF $1.66B is likely.

Something doesn't sit right. Sure, a deal with Microsoft + the Chewy Ceo with ownership and a board seat.... but also talks of turning store into brick and mortar locations to sell gaming computers? Huge inventory costs, huge operating costs, and extremely difficult to compete.

        "selftext": "Here me out. \n\nXiaomi Ticker $XIACF is probably one of the most undervalued companies at the moment and here is why:\n\nDespite its weak branding in the Western hemisphere, Xiaomi is one of the largest tech companies in the world. Standing at rank four, Xiaomi competes against electronic manufacturing giants such as\u00a0Apple, Google, and Microsoft.\n\nAffordable pricing\n\nXiaomi offers smartphones and other electronic devices at extremely competitive prices. This is extremely important for two reasons. First off, Xiaomi\u2019s budget-friendly pricing allows them to compete for the more budget-friendly consumers in developed regions. Secondly, it allows them to enter new, previously-untapped markets in which smartphones were previously too expensive. For example,\u00a0Xiaomi is able to sell millions of devices in the Asian market, especially in China and\u00a0India, which would be impossible as a luxury brand such as Apple or Samsung.\n\nSubstantial profit margins\n\nMost amazing of all, Xiaomi is able to offer quality products at affordable prices, and still make plenty of profit for themselves. Quite consistently,\u00a0Xiaomi has posted profits\u00a0amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars. Xiaomi can thank low manufacturing costs for their high-profit margins. These low manufacturing costs are likely due to\u00a0the low cost of labor in China, as well as the significant economy of scale which arises when manufacturing so many devices.\n\nTLDR; undervalued stock with high potential waiting to blow up.\n\nLet's take this fucker to the moon: \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80",

I'm happy people are making gains, and perhaps more happy some of these big boys that shorted are getting shafted. but have you guys actually set foot in one of their stores? \n\nThere is nothing pleasant about the gamestop experience. Strange atmosphere, high pressure sales tactics to gain your personal information, really poor trade in incentives.\n\nThe rise of digit sales and popular buy/sell/trade websites has destroyed their business model. Some may point to the deal with Microsoft, but what does that actually entail? The ability to rent consoles and have better access to your personal information. There is very little value to the majority of gamestop's customer base by that partnership. Unless you are a clueless parent to a gamer child there is no reason to set foot in the store.\n\nMake no mistake the partnership is not gamestop's entry into the digital sale market, that market is already saturated with well established and matured platforms often from the console manufacturer. \n\nThe new generation consoles have provided a boost in sales, but once they are no longer scarce consumers will just purchase from a large box store that doesn't try to pressure them into some membership plan as soon as they enter the building.\n\nI am curious how the new board members will affect things. In my mind a dead fish is a dead fish no matter who is holding it. Maybe they can leverage the physical locations into something new like a furniture outlet, but without sweeping and drastic changes this announcement means nothing.\n\nBefore anyone asks, yes I am sad I've missed out on the gains.

Please note, much of this is not my writing, rather info collected from their website and other sources. All of which you may verify on your own by visiting the various websites linked and reading for yourself and doing your own DD. \n\n(I'm not a financial advisor, please note any opinions expressed here are my own.)\n\n**About VNUE**\n\n VNUE is a music technology company dedicated to further monetizing the live music experience for artists, labels, writers, publishers, and literally all stakeholders, by creating new and exciting products; by leveraging automation technology and second-to-none experience in the instant live space; and by identifying issues such as lack of transparency with performance rights organizations and solving this through innovation and our patent-pending solutions.\u00a0 \n\nThe VNUE team is the most experienced in our space, a group of technology entrepreneurs, artists and songwriters who are passionate about the future of the industry, and ensuring that the value of the rights holders are not lost in the context of new and ever-changing technology.\n\nVNUE is the exclusive licensor of \"instant live\" pioneer [DiscLive](http://www.disclive.net/),  offering high-end collectible products such as CDs, USB drives and laminates, that feature our fully mixed and mastered live concert content.\n\nVNUE also utilizes our exclusive [set.fm](http://www.set.fm/) technology to help artists and labels render real revenue from live shows by making that content available to the set.fm platform immediately after the show, utilizing our DiscLive expertise.\n\nFinally, VNUE is rolling out our [Soundstr](http://www.soundstr.com/) music identification technology to venues, bars, restaurants, radio stations, and more, to ensure that artists are being properly compensated for music that is performed, and also to ensure that businesses pay by use, rather than expensive blanket license agreements.\u00a0 VNUE is revolutionizing how royalties are paid, and injecting transparency into an otherwise complicated and murky world.\n\nBy  (a) selling only live content through our platforms, to include not just major and independent label content, but creating and scaling our own \u201cinstant\u201d live exclusive content, (b) processing and paying mechanical royalties on instant live content, and (c), ensuring proper accounting and payment to rights holders of material played in venues,  VNUE has a perfect trifecta of solutions that will revolutionize the live music business.\n\n**Management Team:**\n\n **ZACH BAIR \u2022 CEO &amp; CHAIRMAN**   \n VNUE CEO Zach Bair started  his musical ambitions at 6 years old, \"banging\" on his mother's baby  grand piano, much to her chagrin. This evolved into trumpet playing in  high school and eventually \"loud\" rock-n-roll bands by the time college  and beyond hit. An entrepreneur, Zach has started multiple tech and  music companies, including **Immediatek, which rolled out Bair\u2019s  copy-control technology in 2002, and subsequently commercialized the  original DiscLive, considered to be the pioneer of the \"instant live\"  space, on a groundbreaking tour with the Pixies in 2004. Immediatek sold  to Mark Cuban in 2006.** Prior to  Immediatek, he founded Voyence (previously known as PowerUp Networks)  based on patented software of his design, and raised over $12M in a  Series A round of funding. That company eventually sold to EMC Corp. He  has carried the torch for music and technology ever since, continuing to  pursue greater control, protection, and revenue for artists and labels,  culminating in his leadership with VNUE to take the model to the next  level.   \n \n\n**LOU MANN \u2022 EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT &amp; DIRECTOR**   \n \n\nLou is former Executive Vice President and General Manager of **Capital Records,**  and also former president of Media Properties for House of Blues.  During his time with House of Blues, where he reported directly to the  CEO, Mann successfully introduced the HOB to the recorded music industry  by developing a viable label and signing major artists.   \n \n\n**TONY CARDENAS \u2022 CHIEF CREATIVE OFFICER &amp; DIRECTOR**   \n  Better known as \"Tony Montana,\" the bassist and co-writer for double  platinum recording artist Great White from 1987-1992, Tony has gone on  to a successful career not only in music, producing and recording, but  also as a hi-tech entrepreneur.

Allow me to offer this metaphor... Currently, when it comes to collecting data with regards to how many \"spins\" a song gets at a radio station or is played at other venues, the data is reviewed with the accuracy of a dirty magnifying glass from a child's detective play kit. Soundstr will provide the resolution of an electron microscope. See, it's not only the data but the accuracy and reliability of the data collected due to the fact there is a physical interface in-between is what makes VNUE so incredibly valuable. \n\nFood for thought... when it came to Facebook, what made them so valuable is the data they are able to collect.  \n\n**Catalysts upcoming:**\n\nThey are about to launch their first 450 Soundstr units which are already in hand at their warehouse. \n\nThey are about to announce they have completed their next fund raising round to take the business to the next level ($3MM - $5MM), build more Soundstr units and....\n\nThey are about to complete a **share buyback** with the funds raised.\n\n**My opinions:**\n\nI believe this stock should already be trading between .03 - .05 today so it is really at a discount right now and that's before today's news. There are companies on the OTC which have far less going for them, have debt, etc. etc. and they are trading for 20X as much. Here is a clean company with no debt and the right technology with everything going for them. Do some research and get on board if you understand the opporunity. \n\nThis stock WILL have its run from pennies to $'s... it's just a matter of how long it takes for the market to realize what we have on our hands here.",

        "selftext": "*Tl;dr read the bold*\n\nAs we're all scratching our heads at GME (not really, u/deepfuckingvalue was laser-precise), many of you also caught wind of **BB's quiet surge yesterday**. You've probably read u/Rostatos' excellent [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ks4s3s/bb_king_the_blast_from_the_past_with_the/) on Blackberry that explains in great detail why **this thing's taking off**. If not (but I suggest you go read it because the presentation is much better and more thorough), the main points are:\n\n\\- *it's a company that's shedding its legacy phone image (gonna release a* [5G phone this year](https://www.slashgear.com/blackberry-5g-phone-coming-in-2021-with-security-and-design-at-the-forefront-30635550/) *though with a physical keyboard. A physical keyboard!) and is diving deep into cybersecurity and software; also*\n\n*- well* [*positioned*](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/industries/aws-and-blackberry-qnx-join-forces-to-accelerate-auto-innovation-with-blackberry-ivy-a-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform/) *in a sustainable (meaning can produce enduring returns, likely despite industry volatility/shakedowns) way alongside Amazon for the ongoing and upcoming EV hype;*\n\n*- a series of upcoming, promising investor* [*events*](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-to-participate-in-upcoming-investor-conferences-301201268.html) *that could deliver further good and hopefully momentous news after the resolution/settlement today of a* [*lawsuit*](https://www.law.com/therecorder/2020/12/07/blackberrys-patent-campaign-against-facebook-may-get-new-life/) *with FB, on terms favorable to BB*\n\nOverall, this is a company you want to own (shares), but also that you want to bet on the short-term growth of (calls) due to some recent and upcoming events. Now, in terms of the way forward, we're talking about legacy company that was going sideways for a month at around $7-$7.45/share and now has **shot up to $10.44** **in 2 days** (**+20% in pre-market** today alone). This type of meteoric climb at week's end **might trigger a bunch of institutional selling today**, as holding over the weekend is quite a gamble for what was otherwise a steady stock. 46% of BB is owned by institutions; make of this what you will.\n\n**It could also continue on a uninterrupted climb** without a dip, as more and more investors look up what Blackberry's been quietly up to and realize that holy shit, this thing is promising. Let's be honest: we're all looking to get a Kirkland-brand GME \ud83d\ude80, and in this case, the company's fundamentals are nowhere near as political and dependent on one (albeit highly capable) person's involvement - as GME's was with Cohen. Similar to GME and Microsoft, though, this stock now has the backing of a solid firm behind it (Amazon). This all looks good for institutions, and might trigger a snatch-up of shares (especially for the dumbasses that shorted GME and are now scrambling to cover those losses). That's a whole other discussion though, and this isn't about GME. It's about BB. Stay focused.\n\nThe point is, whether BB momentarily dips before the weekend and then climbs more steadily over the next couple of weeks, or whether it continues into the exosphere today and over the weekend, this is an incredibly undervalued stock with high promise for future performance for reasons listed above and in the linked DD. \n\nSo either **get in at market open** \\- risk getting shaken a bit but leave nowhere near as much money on the table - **or get in at the next dip** after it cools off - risking that there might be no such dip and you'll feel that familiar pang of regret in the very foundation of your soul that brings you closer and closer to the brink every day. **Either way, get in and buy as much in shares as you do in calls**. We must keep in mind that a powerful tool at our disposal is that we can snatch up shares, drawing down availability which accelerates the price. \n\nPositions: **6/18/21 $15 C**, buying **shares at open** with profits from yesterday",

        "selftext": "Sup guys hope you all feeling good today. So I have an accounting exam next Sunday and I thought to myself how to study for this shitty test, and then it hit me, FUCK COLLEGE let's check how is BB doing right now. So I decided to a DD on BB to show you guys why Im bullish on this company. Let's start:\n\n**What Is BlackBerry ($BB) and what is it doing right now?**\n\nBB provides intelligent security software and services to enterprises and governments. It secures more than 500M endpoints\\* including 175M cars. The company uses AI and Machine Learning to improve its cybersecurity software, safety, and data privacy of the users. They state in their reports that they are the leaders in the areas of endpoint security, encryption, and data embedded systems\\*\\*.\n\n\\**Endpoint- securing entry points of end-user devices such as laptops, desktops, phones, IoT, and wireless devices from being exploited. Endpoint security is mainly on the cloud or the internet.                                         \\*embedded security- Small computers (mainly CPU) that are a part of a bigger system and do specific tasks and allow users to interact with the system, device, or machine.*\n\n**IoT Security**\n\nThe growth of devices that are connected to the cloud/Internet gives hackers a lot of targets to attack. From phones, laptops, and cars to industrial equipment and servers. BB has one of the broadest tools of solutions for these problems with software that gives solutions for every industry. for example, QNX is best suited for auto, medical, industrial automation, and green energy solution, all are industries that are growing and expected for huge growth for years to come. SecuSuite for governments which in the last few months saw a huge spike in successful cyber attacks. Certicom for automated cars, and area that is growing but still is not on a huge scale.\n\nIoT software is the company's main source of revenue (around 50%), the downside is that revenue from this segment is on a downturn but mainly because BB is doing a reorganization of the sales force. The bright side is the Cylance, the company's new acquisition revenue are up 20.5% YOY.\n\n**Company Achievements**\n\n* Launched BB Digital Workplace, a workspace integrated with Microsoft Office 365 that gives you secure access to corporate content on and offline.\n* Launched together with Zoom a secured version of the app\n* UEM software achieved NSA commercial solution for classified programs (allows BB to work with the US government)\n* Integration of AtHoc with Microsoft Teams\n* BB UES was able to detect the attack of Russian hackers\n* Released an open-source tool for cybersecurity experts that helps with the process of reverse engineering malware attacks.\n* AWS partnership to develop and market BB IVY intelligent vehicle data platform\n\nand much more stuff like governments contracts more tools release and so on.\n\nPartnership with ServiceNow and lots of EV company's like Canoo, Plus, and more. partnership with Vodafone and TALUS for crisis solution management.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 0hbeioxyg4c61...*\n\n If you read the reports you will find hundreds of agreements and accomplishments that I didn't write. This IVY is supposed to be a great growth engine:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 1abkws2kg4c61...*\n\n**Management**\n\nJohn Chen-  The CEO since 2013, pivoted the company from hardware to software. Was the CEO of a company that got sold to SAP and Siemens Nixdorf's open enterprise computing division. a member of US-China policy advisory under Bush's administration. Was a board member of Disney and Wells Fargo.\n\nCharles Eagen - The CTO of the company, a huge advocate of IoT. Was the Global Head of Electronics Dyson and focused mainly on IoT.  was formerly Vice President of Engineering for QNX Software, where he concentrated on the automotive and embedded markets. He also worked at Cisco and directed the development of the seminal CRS-1 carrier routing system.\n\nBoth Guys are tech-oriented and focus on IoT and software. These guys are brilliant with a great vision for the company.\n\n**Financials**\n\nThe company has Long-Term debt of 459M of convertible notes with 1.75% interest duo for Nov 2023. Currently they enough cash to cover a bit less than half of it but enough short-term investments to help cover the rest and still be left with cash on hand.\n\nGoodwill is down mainly because of impairment and new accounting practice that has been adopted. That is the main driver for assets being down that much (1B YOY). Overall the company has a great Asset to Liabilities Ratio of 2.68. **BV of BB is 3$, which means that a third of the share price is backed with Equity.**\n\nRevenue is up 15% YOY thanks to software sales. software sales up approximately 68% from 2017 to today. of course that like a lot of other companies, Rona hit the revenue of BB but they are recovering pretty well. \n\nSG&amp;A is down to 40% of the revenue as opposed to 56.2% as of the same Q in 2018. expenses are down a lot overall from recent years which helped to increase the margin and pay off the debt of 600M. \n\nRecurring revenue is greater than 90% for the software segment and BB expects that IVY (the software which is a partnership with AWS) will start having recurring revenue at around 2023. FCF is positive for the last 5 years (maybe more I couldn't find info far dated).\n\nThe gross margin is up to 76%. The operating margin is up 7%.\n\nThat's it for now hopefully I will come up with another post that will bring more info in the coming week.\n\n**Positions:** 200 Shares at 9$ (I have all the rest at GME and MT )\n\n**TL;DR -** BB is not the same phone company it was, becoming more innovative and penetrating growing industries. Im Bullish on BB long term.\n\n*This is not financial advice do your own DD maybe you will learn something retards.*",

        "selftext": "Let's brainstorm this a little bit.  I'm sure most of you saw that snippet from 60 minutes (posted on WSB recently), saying, \"Amazon would have to sell every book being sold in the world today to justify its stock price.\" That was way back in the late 1990s when Amazon was just an on-line book store. \n\nSomeone else said, \"That's Tesla today.\" \n\nI'd like to know how. \n\nAmazon had a clear path to expand from selling books, to household gadgets, to literally everything and anything sold by anyone anywhere. Including things that didn't exist in the 1990s, like AWS cloud services (that \\*should\\* have gone to someone like Akamai or CSCO or MSFT, or Oracle or even freaking WalMart had a better information system infrastructure than Amazon had in the 1990s.)  Amazon dominating that segment was just a fluke. And currently the lion's share of its revenue too.\n\nAlso, I wanted an electric car but didn't want Tesla's goofy iPad-style interface system, among other things, so I took an old sports car and built my own EV. Guess what? EV's are not hard. Sure, mine is definitely not more efficient than a Tesla (or Bolt, or etc.) but I learned something important -- replacing the drivetrain and installing batteries was the easy part (granted, I have some electrical engineering experience -- but not much). Literally everything else about building a car was way, way, WAY harder. Companies like Ford, GM, Toyota, VW, etc. can \\*easily\\* outbuild Tesla, and highly efficient, high-torque electric motors and solid state batteries appear to be on their way to commodity status. \n\nSolar Panels, self-driving capability, yada, yada... I don't see how these can possibly match the scale of what Amazon did. Grid energy storage, merging with Space-X and using Starlink's Skynet as part of the self-driving hive-mind... maybe? \n\nWhat else could there be? Fully autonomous, self-managing houses? Is Tesla going to start selling phones that use Starlink, to fulfill the space Iridium tried to back in the 90's? \n\nHelp me understand how TSLA \\*might\\* live-up to its current stock price. I want to believe, but currently, I'm just not seeing it.",

Now time for the DD \n\nUpon a brief look over their financials such Q4 and Q10 and it\u2019s clearly evident that run has been due to the lowering of debt by a lot which is good news for the company but it\u2019s shudnt be enough to yolo your account on it truly a recipe for options player to make sweet tendies... in the short terms in Ryan Cohen words \"GameStop needs to evolve into a technology company that delights gamers and delivers exceptional digital experiences \u2013 not remain a videogame retailer that overprioritizes its brick-and-mortar footprint and stumbles around the online ecosystem,\". And I\u2019m going to be honest personally I don\u2019t see this happening because they are a third party seller who whole sellers like Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo screw over.

        "selftext": "* 76% of WSB who's still in GME collectively orgasmed yesterday as GME pushed to the stratosphere with the stock soaring as high as 90% during intraday high. Profit taking and volatile swings brought the shares down to a modest close of \"only\" up 57% at $31.40. u/DeepFuckingValue, who has titanium alloy diamond hands (now known as DFV hands) posted an update and to the surprise of no one, is still holding his 1,000 contracts of Jan 15 $20c on Wednesday afternoon. (Note: He took gains on the contracts today though I'm not sure at what point in the day while keeping his April $12c).\n\n* The pump action resumed for GME this Thursday morning with premarket pushing the underlying back to $38 once again and commenced to another wild session of large movements. Initially trading around $34 to $36 in morning, GME started to rip once again when noon struck and ran as high as $43 for the day. GME closed the day up 27% to $40. If you're STILL not in GME, these back-to-back days have pushed IV to new highs and even OTM contracts months out will be commanding large premium (~160%+ IV for April and 140%+ for July). Proceed with caution (who am I kidding just go all in).\n\n* Morning economic numbers: jobless claims continues its dismal trend, with first-time claims hitting 965k last week vs the consensus of 800k (oof). Last week's total was 784k. As with before, market did not react to the numbers cuz its PrIcEd iN. Import prices rose 0.9 in Dec vs 0.6 expected.\n\n* Jpow spoke at 12:30 PM today in a Princeton Uni session and reaffirmed what everyone has largely expected: rates will continue to be low and while the Feds will raise rate eventually, Jpow says that its \"no time soon\" given economic situation.\n\n* Are they big tech or big cuck? The market reversed course and big tech continues their sell off, with MSFT, AAPL, NFLX, and AMZN all retreating more than -1% as yet another sector rotation commenced. Payment providers got an extra dose of sell-off with V closing at -3.43% and MA closing at -5.25%, despite both having positive PT from Deutsche Bank today with V having a PT increase of $270 from $220 and MA PT increase of $420 from $383.\n\n* Small caps performed strongly today as money flow throughout the day into \"value\" grabs. RUT/IWM closed the day up 2%. Notable underlyings beyond GME are BBBY (up 18.77%), MIK (up 9.6%), M (up 5%), WSM (up 4%), and KIRK (up 9.58%).\n\n* In WSB meme stock land MT continues in its channel, gaining 2.95% today to close at $24.81 PLTR got hit with another downgrade, this time via Citi as the analysts believes the stock is vulnerable to a few upcoming catalyst, including lockup expiry and an deceleration in growth. PT for Citi is $15 (don't worry tho surely WSB is \"in control\" with this stock too). PLUG drilled more than -5.74% during intraday low as JPM initiated with a neutral rating and downgraded sector competitor FCEL. PLUG closed the day down -4.26% to $64.63 while FCEL closed the day down -8% to $17.60, fending off intraday low of more than -12%. ICLN, the clean tech ETF continues its range bound trading and will likely require a clear catalyst in terms of what the $2 tril stimulus actually entails to move further. Buckle up, loser.\n\n* Despite being green most of the day, major indexes retreated to red as power hour neared. Indexes went red and lost all its morning gains as the sell-off accelerated into closing hours. DOW closed the day down -0.22% or -69 pts, IXIC closed down -0.12% or -16 pts, SPX closed -0.38% or -14 pts, and RUT closed up 2% or 43 pts. While the retreat was modest compare to yesterday's close, the intraday reversal was quite jarring esp if you're trading FDs (and let's face it, you definitely were loading up on those Jan 1/15 calls).\n\n* Earning season will soon be upon us and the first wave are starting later this week. Tomorrow morning financials kick things off as WFC, JPM, and C are all reporting before market opens. If banks shat the bed, expect a pounding for the Dow given how large of a component they are still to the stupid index. Expectations are fairly high as JPM has had a flurry of upgrades in the past few days with PT of $150 from Piper Sandler, $152 from Jefferies, and an upgrade to buy from neutral at BofA.\n\n* Biden will unveil his $2 tril stimulus package/plan in a speech later tonight at 7:15 PM ET. Please pump those green tech cuz I have an embarrassing amount in SPAC/EVs.\n\n(Yesterday's recap: none cuz I was lazy and enjoying gains.

        "selftext": "**Biden unveils the $1.9T stimulus package proposal. Tesla starts deliveries of the Model Y in China. Lemonade drops after the latest Citron short opinion while Nikola &amp; GameStop shareholders jump ship. Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of the last few days as I haven\u2019t made a post since Wednesday, as I was busy making a full stock analysis on Amazon which you can check by clicking [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ky3nxo/amazon_stock_price_target_prediction_analysis_dcf/).\n\nSo, on Thursday we saw all 3 major indexes finish in the red, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/MPQ6PVW) losing .12%, the [DOW](https://ibb.co/GJf3qV9) dropping almost 70 points and the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/r51hS22) dropping below $3800 to finish the day, as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/sq1P6gm) rose again by almost 5%, though 70% of the companies were [advancing](https://ibb.co/yhsdpZD) on normal volumes with just 8 new lows, as 4 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/ZW0k1VD) finished in the green with Energy outperforming by quite some gap, while Technology was the biggest loser, as Large-Cap Growth companies were the [underperformers](https://ibb.co/jZW53gf), while small-caps shined, with all 3 segments gaining more than 2% for the day.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/hsmYfRz) from Thursday, with Amazon, Microsoft, Tesla, Netflix &amp; Facebook all losing more than 1%, while the biggest gainers were the Semiconductors, Alibaba and some companies from the Materials and Oil &amp; Gas Industry.\n\nWe also received the investor sentiment [survey](https://ibb.co/XZNYQHY), which for me came in better with a drop of almost 1% in bullish investors and 4% in neutral ones, as fear has reached almost 5% more investors in this past week, which is a good sign for opportunities in the stock market.\n\nMeanwhile, Friday was even worse for the broad stock market, with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Ms5m47G) losing .72% as the [DOW](https://ibb.co/dKc4ZV0) dropped 177 points while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/MkcyrQV) was the biggest underperformer dropping below $13000, as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/RSGmvvN) continued to rise near the 25 level and even had a spike near the 26 level in the early morning, but overall finished the [week](https://ibb.co/SnvsgHc) down almost 3%.\n\nWe saw again 4 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/0GTqNZG) finish in the green, but this time Energy was the biggest underperformer, losing almost 4% and giving up some of the huge gains made up this week, while Real Estate was the only sector to post a gain of more than 1% and Communications continued to recover after a bad start to the week, as almost 70% of the companies were declining on [Friday](https://ibb.co/grwfwwM), with Large-Cap Growth Companies slightly recovering to finish the [week](https://ibb.co/vX2mxss) down only 1.2%\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/GdWj575) from Friday, in which you can struggle to find some bright spots, with the gains being concentrated in the Health Care &amp; Real Estate sectors, while for the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/441kLYw), there is some more breadth with Energy, Banks and Semiconductors also posting some gains.\n\nOn Thursday we also saw [Powell](https://ibb.co/M7vznm4) reiterating the point that rates won\u2019t be raised unless inflation becomes a serious problem, as he believes there is still plenty of room in the labor markets until maximum employment is reached, with this point being sustained by the increase in initial jobless [CLAIMS](https://ibb.co/X5brzGZ) which jumped almost 200K, a lot worse than expected and the previous month, as continuing jobless claims also jumped by about the same to 5.27M, a big increase over last week.\n\nMoving on, Friday we also received more economic data, with the January [Consumer](https://ibb.co/n38hy4w) sentiment coming in at 79.2 lower than expected and the previous read, as consumers have lost confidence both in the current conditions and in expectations.\n\nWe also saw the New York business [activity](https://ibb.co/92Rydt9) coming in at 3.5, worse than the 6 expected and the 4.9 in the previous month, with new orders seeing an increase but being offset by a huge drop in shipments.\n\nBusiness [Inventories](https://ibb.co/TRs2SMW) came in as expected at a .5% increase M/M, while Producer [prices](https://ibb.co/py4bpTn) rose less than expected and retail [sales](https://ibb.co/X2v2Y0Z) fell more than expected with a .7% decrease M/M.\n\nThis [WEEK](https://ibb.co/VqGMnJT) we start of slow, with no big data coming in until Thursday as we await the Biden inauguration tomorrow while the most interesting [earnings](https://ibb.co/B2T64dc) for me are Goldman Sachs as a continued read on how the banks are doing after last weeks good numbers, Netflix to see how the stay-at-home stocks will continue to perform and Intel to see how they manage to turn around things.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [Aphria](https://ibb.co/nwxNpm0) beat consensus in earnings and starting a broad rally in pot stocks, while [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/vw4dXQ7) dropped more than 9% after CITRON went at them again, implying a drop back to under 100$ expected very soon.\n\nWe also saw IPOs soar again in the first trading day, with [PETCO](https://ibb.co/KwTHrvY) popping almost 50% and [POSHMARK](https://ibb.co/3cGk45W) more than doubling before dropping 20% as this IPOs are way overbought on every single launch just like most of the SPACs, with [Churchill](https://ibb.co/6JGGKHP) Capital also climbing huge on reports of a Lucid Motors deal, but this is only speculation and could have massive downside if the deal doesn\u2019t go through.\n\nMeanwhile, [Delta](https://ibb.co/FzGKp9C) Airlines reported Q4 earnings and hinted at a positive cash flow by late-spring or summer as they reduced the cash burn from $24M to $12M/ day in Q4, which helped most of the airlines rally.\n\nThursday was capped off my [Biden's](https://ibb.co/bzh0fsV) new relief package proposal that seems to be around $1.9T. This will serve probably as a start point of future negotiations. This package includes $400B in crisis aids including $20B for vaccines, $50B for testing, $30B for supplies and $140B targeted at helping schools reopen and stay open.\n\nThe plan also includes $1T in aids to individuals including $1400 stimulus checks and extending the unemployment benefits to $400/week through September, $30B in rental assistance and extending the federal moratorium on evictions and foreclosure through September and increasing the minimum wage to $15/hour.\n\nBiden\u2019s propsal also includes the highly debated help for state &amp; local governments worth $350B &amp; $50B in small business grants and loans. \n\nThis will probably serve as a starting point and I don\u2019t expect everything to pass even with the blue sweep. It\u2019s likely going to be less than $1.9T, and most of the debate will continue to happen on the state &amp; local help and is also likely to exclude things like increasing the minimum hourly wage, as this is not something temporary like most of the other costs and is likely to receive big roadblocks. This will likely be a short-term boost for the stock market, but the impacts of this in terms of inflation, debt and other economic factors are still unknown in the long-run.\n\nAnd moving on, Friday we saw [Tesla's](https://ibb.co/Vqmf9Mm) forecasted deliveries increased to 1M cars by Wedbush who also raised their price target to $950 with a bull case of $1250, as the Tesla [Model Y](https://ibb.co/1Qws23d) has finally started deliveries in China and will be one of the biggest bets Tesla has made, as the affordable SUV demand is much higher than any of the other Tesla models, while in contrast [Nikola](https://ibb.co/r3dFQSk) seems to be having firms jumping board with an early investor recently selling over 7M shares. Some similar action was seen from the director of [GameStop](https://ibb.co/rvyQdvq) who sold 800K shares after the recent pop in the stock. This kind of companies provide high risk/high reward opportunities, but you should have a tight approach to them, you should take profits whenever you can and not risk losing your gains on these highly volatile stocks that don\u2019t have a good fundamental basis.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/nr2Pw5W) markets seem to be pointing to a good day, as we await Biden\u2019s pick Janet Yellen\u2019s [remarks](https://ibb.co/bsjzK1b) on the proposed stimulus and the dollar while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/S3cfpZq) are also pointing to a green open, with the Nasdaq leading the way. \n\nThank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "I'm just curious to do some research to see how short dated call IV/skew/leap puts line up with some of the companies back then and how they transformed over the course of 1999-2001. \n\nIn particular, I'm interested in Qualcomm (QCOM), which to me could be considered a \"less volatile\" (ironic since it was quite volatile itself) version of Tesla. For those who don't know, QCOM was thought of the great next generation company back then, and it was actually a really, really good company. The only problem is it was about 10 years too early so it crashed along with the market. There was nothing wrong with QCOM (look at it now), and I believe Tesla will be higher in 20 years too, but the issue is if the market crashes, everything crashes and the high fliers go down the fastest, even if they are good companies. If Tesla does crash, 2000 QCOM is the closest comparison imo. \n\nI would also be interested in if anyone has options data for MSFT, CSCO, INTC, AAPL, GE, and DELL then (those would be like the MFAANGs of today), as well as some of the more stable stocks then like WMT, JNJ, PFE, and the big oil companies. Was there a constant rotation between them and tech every day like what we have now? \n\nFinally, there are the super high growth companies today like ROKU, TWLO, NET, FSLY, ZS, NIO and other EVs who have taken off today. I want to see how they compare to the super high growth companies like AMZN, CMGI, IPET, and JDSU back then (notice how some like AMZN survived but CMGI did not so not trying to be biased either way). \n\nOr in general, does anyone have any ideas/discussions on how to trade in this environment?",

        "selftext": "Maybe this reads like a diary entry, but fuck it, if this one's not on your radar already then check it out if you like digital ad plays like MGNI and APPS.\n\nMy last post on PERI (Perion) from about a month ago when it was trading at about $10 got a little bit of love, and it has been a wild ride on this low-float bastard since then. Hit $17.85 a couple weeks ago before a massive short attack drove it down to sub $12, and it has since settled in nicely at the $14.00 to $14.50 range on decent volume everyday this week. They just presented at the Needham conference this week and put out a nice little investor presentation that confirms their current growth is looking primo. Check it out [here](https://www.perion.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/perion-IR-deck-20210112.pdf) \n\nBottom line: 4-year $800 million Microsoft contract is confirmed, nice expansion into the CTV space with 232% quarterly growth in revenue since Q3 in that sector, and expected revenue of over $100 million in Q4 (they report earnings on February 9th). \n\nYes, that's correct, this company has more revenue that MGNI and APPS right now, and is trading at 1/8th the market cap of MGNI and 1/13th the market cap of APPS. Sure it may have a lower potential growth rate compared to those two, but its trading at a market cap of essentially 1:1 revenue, which is absolutely unfucking heard of in this sector. It has run up about 100% since November already, and it's still trading at that big of a discount. That's how much room this puppy has to run.\n\nAnd guess who else knows how much of a steal this valuation is? Aunt Cathie and ARK have added over 120k shares since early December when I last posted. They currently have 286K shares as their #1 largest holding in their IZRL ETF. Check it out [here](https://ark-funds.com/wp-content/fundsiteliterature/holdings/ARK_ISRAEL_INNOVATIVE_TECHNOLOGY_ETF_IZRL_HOLDINGS.pdf). \n\nIn my opinion, this thing has a lot of gas left in the tank to run in 2021. All analysts following this thing (which, granted, ain't a ton) have a buy rating and one just upgraded the target price to $18. Yeah yeah, analysts don't know shit (yada yada yada), but it tells you where a few of the wall street boys want this thing to go.\n\nAnyway, it's late in the day and I need a beer, so I'll finish my rant, but if you are into digital ad plays and want something that isn't trading at its peak yet, check this one out (or don't, doesn't matter to me). Remember boys and girls, this thing has a microfloat of only 21 million tradable shares (comparable to CRSR), it's volatile, it swings like a mofo on a daily basis, and it runs into the occasional short attack. But if you love this daily volatility and long growth prospects heading into 2021 (like I do), then take a look.\n\ntl:dr: read the post, it ain't that long. ARK loading every week, $800 million contract with microsoft, Q4 revenues looking spicy.\n\nMy Positions: 40 contracts of April 10c (up over 300% and the thought of selling hasn't even crossed my mind).

        "selftext": "You all keep saying GME is just a bricks and mortar shop and it has a rubbish online presence atm.Yes I agree. But the whole point of the share price is to value a company's future cashflow in its present situation. \n\nThe share price is so low because the market thinks the same, but it is so obvious it will change, whether under Ryan Cohen or not. Therefore, once that positive change has been made, expected future cashflows increase and the share price rockets \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nYou all have no belief I know, but think about it. If the market thought it couldn't be changed under RC's guidance then why did the price take off? \ud83d\ude80\n\nIt is because the market believes in his influence. The only reason GME hasn't gone further is because of some massive market manipulation, which once we get out of (hopefully due to a short squeeze, even a minor one), the share price will be at a comfortable $30 in a month or two.\n\nAlso, for anyone that is saying that why should you buy stuff through GME when you could go via Sony/ Microsoft/ etc, don't you realise GME is going down the PC route? I.e. be a one stop shop for everything PC, including gaming and hardware. Oh wait is that a reason to still have brick and mortar? Oh yes it is... and maybe if there was a situation where GME could reduce its rent on its shops due to distressed real estate? Hmm... if only we had some type on scenario like that atm...\n\nLastly, just if you are downwards facing, then just remember that if you fuck up you're going to end up with a debt the size of the US government in a month's time so if I were you anyway I'd take profits asap, cos this motherfucker is Mooning quicker than Mel Gibson in Braveheart. \ud83c\udf1a",

        "selftext": "8 years ago I had a small trading account with $100 left in it. I didn't really care what I did with it. The money had come from me playing Diablo 3 and making some money on the auction house that was available shortly after release.\n\nI bought final day UNH $60 calls (around 5 of them), when it was sitting at $55 on a Thursday, the day before earnings. I got very lucky and the next day the stock opened at $61. I made $500 or so. Luckily I only had 1 day on the options, so I didn't make any mistake of trying to hold onto them too long.\n\nI then started to dig into stocks with high short-interest because my personal investment theory was that these types of stocks were essentially rocket ships with weights holding them down...and if you get a good uptick in the stock price, those shorts will flee and the weights come off.\n\nI found this weird car company called Tesla soon after my UNH victory. It had some random weird CEO. Crazy high short interest. They were about to do earnings and this stock was on an uptick, up about 50% in a month, and still had crazy short interest even after the increase in stock price. So I bought a call $60 strike call a few minutes before the market closed and earnings came out.\n\nA week later I'm sitting on $5k and I started to think I was the literal reincarnation of god. I decided it was time to bail on Tesla and get me some FSLR. I lost a ton on that somehow...was down to $1000 or so soon after. \n\nI then bought Tesla calls after it crashed from $190 to $120.\n\nFast forward 4 months - I somehow managed to flip that $1000 into $15,000 by closing my eyes and never selling the Tesla calls.\n\nBy this point, I was doing all kinds of trades. But I hit big on a MSFT put bet over their Surface debacle...popped my account up to $25,000 or so.\n\nI, again, thought I was the best thing since sliced bread and started throwing money at all kinds of stuff. For example, I put $10k into call options on Apple one week and lost it all. So dumb.\n\nI eventually decided that I was a fool and needed to stop doing options. So I was able to take all my leftover cash and buy 125 shares of Tesla in 2016-ish or so.\n\nAnd deciding I was a fool was the best decision of my life.\n\nSomehow, through all the storms, I held onto those shares. TSLA hit $900 and I was legit feeling the smartest person on the planet. I couldn't believe my account was hitting $90k...\n\nAnd then in like 3-4 weeks it almost all disappeared as it crashed to $300 from COVID. I thought about selling and cutting my losses and walking away with $35k or so.\n\nBut...I told myself that I'm a moron and I just need to stop trying...so I didn't do anything. I just held and assumed I'd lose it all.\n\nThen it recovered to $500...\n\nThen $700...\n\nThen it hit $1000...\n\nThen the stock split was announced after hitting $1500 a share...so then I eventually had almost 600 shares. But I kept telling myself I am a fool so I should just keep my head down and forget about it.\n\nAnd then it hit $880 the other day and I finally sold almost all my shares in that account at $860 for half a million dollars.\n\nAnd 8 years ago, that account only had $100 left in it. Never added any additional capital to it. Just $100.\n\nFor the record, I have other accounts with Tesla, so I'm not out.\n\nTL:DR; I turned $100 into $500,000 cash over 8 years. Elon Musk is god. Options are the evil, but sometimes a necessary evil to get things started from small amounts. The less decisions you make, the better, because you are probably dumb too, just like me. And finally, Diablo 3 FTW.",

Haven't done this before. I was looking to start with 500USD and gradually grow it to 5000 this year as I start understanding more about the market.\n\nThe biggest worry I have right now is looking at companies like Microsoft who've been around for quite a while. Their stock price is at 222.42 right now. How high can it really go from here? Do you imagine that in 5-10 years the usual share cost would be at 1k or so?\n\nWould you recommend waiting until April or so? The share prices seem to be largely overevaluated.\n\nAlso, would it be ok maybe to start with an ETF instead? Thanks a lot!",

        "selftext": " **TL:DR**\n\n* This is Part 2 of what is now going to be a three part deep dive on Smartsheet (Ticker: SMAR).\n* This second part walks you through the beginning of my four piece framework of trying to figure out if the stock can 10x from here: (1) Leadership (2) Risks (3) Price and (4) Growth.\n* In this second part, we are just going to focus on (1) Leadership. As I was writing, I found that Leadership is a very important part of the Smartsheet story and it needed its own article to do it justice. You can read [Part 1 here](https://onthemarkpicks.com/2021/01/01/deep-dive-2-part-1-of-2-smartsheet-solving-the-productivity-paradox/).\n* Smartsheet is an exciting SaaS company that\u2019s helping businesses be more productive and get the most out of their people\n* I am not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice. These are just my opinions to help facilitate learning and discussion.\n\nHi everyone, thanks for coming back for Part 2. I\u2019m excited to bring you more research and insights on Smartsheet (NYSE: SMAR). Let\u2019s dive in.\n\n**Can we 10X from here?**\n\nFor someone like me that is on the younger side and with a longer investment time horizon, and probably you if you are reading this, an important question to ask yourself is \u201cDo I think this investment could 10x from here?\u201d. In other words, could this investment one day be 10 times what it is worth today? To try to answer this question, I will work through a pre-determined framework that I believe gives us the best path to find out.\n\nThe framework includes:\n\nLeadership \u2013 Desire, Purpose and Ownership\n\nRisk Considerations\n\nPrice Considerations\n\nExplosive Business Growth\n\n**1. Leadership \u2013 Desire, Purpose, Ownership**\n\nFor a company to do something as spectacular as 10x, we are going to need to see really strong and talented leadership. In Chris Mayer\u2019s excellent book \u201c100 Baggers\u201d, he dedicates a part of the book to talk about the importance of what he calls \u201cOwner Operators\u201d. By this he means that the CEO of the company owns a substantial amount of stock in the company themselves. Why is this important? If the CEO has their own personal wealth at stake in the company\u2019s stock (just like we do as shareholders) their interests are more aligned with shareholders and maximizing returns for shareholders than they would be if that CEO had no skin in the game. It\u2019s also better in my opinion if the CEO of the company was also the founder of the company. For these founder-CEO\u2019s that have money invested in their own company, it really is like their baby. Would you rather have your money invested with someone who views the company as their baby or with someone who was just hired to watch this kid (the company)?\n\nIn the case of Smartsheet, we check all the boxes when it comes to leadership. Mark Mader is not only an Owner Operator, he is also a co-founder. I touched on this a little bit in part 1, but Mark co-founded Smartsheet along with Brent Frei in 2005. They both played football (American football) for Dartmouth College, an Ivy League School. They met in the fall of 1988 when Mark was a freshman on the team and Brent, who had graduated the prior year, was serving as a Graduate Assistant for the team.\n\nAfter that season, Brent moved on to begin a career in computer engineering. Mark quit the football team after 1 year. In an interview with Forbes, he said that after his freshman season he thought it was too much to juggle Ivy League academics and being a NCAA Division 1 athlete. Mark started focusing solely on academics until a tragedy struck. One of his best friends from his high school football team got into an accident and was critically injured. His friend would never be able to play football again. This had a profound impact on Mark. He said in the interview that knowing one of his friends would never be able to play again made him realize that if he still has the ability to play football, he needs to go do it. He went to his old coach, told him the story about his friend and asked for his spot on the team back. The coach accepted and Mark went on to finish his career in the fall of 1991 as a 6\u20194\u201d, 245lb offensive lineman.\n\nMark said that this experience with his friend and re-joining the football team taught him not to take anything for granted. He said ever since then he tries to do his best with everything and make the most out of every opportunity. That mindset has served him well as he now sits as a CEO of a $8.5 billion company. But he\u2019s really just getting started. That mindset lives on today. The day that he took Smartsheet public, April 27, 2018, he was asked if he plans on celebrating the achievement, he said \u201cWe have 74,000 customers that don\u2019t want us to party, they want us to work on the product.\u201d How did Mark get to the point where he was CEO of a tech company with 74,000 customers that raised $150 million during their IPO? I\u2019ll share with you a little more history behind the company.\n\nAfter Brent Frei left Dartmouth, he started his career in computer engineering as I mentioned before. His career started with Motorola in 1989, then he went to Microsoft in 1991, and then he founded his first company, Onyx Software in 1994. It didn\u2019t take long before his buddy from college, Mark Mader, would come join him at the start-up. Mark joined in 1995 and eventually worked his way up to an Executive role within the firm.\n\nThe focus of Onyx was Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software. Brent was the CEO and Mark became the SVP of Global Services. Brent led the company through an IPO in 1999 right before the tech bubble burst. It was really unfortunate timing because a lot of their customers were dotcoms that went out of business. Brent was still able to lead them through stiff competition with Salesforce in the early 2000\u2019s until he hit a plateau in 2004. He decided to step down from the company he had founded 10 years earlier. On his last call with investors, he was quoted as saying \u201cI believe it\u2019s the right time for me to turn over the reins to a new CEO who can take Onyx to new heights over the next decade,\u201d. All the while, Mark was there in the background learning and observing. He saw what went right \u2013 they built a large publicly traded company from scratch. And he saw what went wrong \u2013 their growth stalled as they lost market share to Salesforce.\n\nOnly a year after resigning from Onyx, Brent was on to his next big move and he again recruited his friend Mark to help. They were going to found Smartsheet, a company to help improve the way people work. This time, Mark was a Co-Founder along with Brent and had a much bigger influence on the company. His influence got even larger in 2017, 12 years after the founding, when Brent left to found his 3rd company, TerraClear. Brent left to go back to his roots in Idaho where he grew up on the family farm. His new start-up TerraClear seeks to solve one of the largest unsolved problems in farming today \u2013 clearing rocks from farming land. As crazy as that sounds, apparently it\u2019s a big issue. Hence the name, TerraClear. Brent is still on the Board of Directors of Smartsheet.\n\nGoing back to the IPO date (April 27, 2018), which was only 4 months after Brent had left, Mark was asked by the press what he had learned from being at Onyx when they went public. Mark was very clear in his response and said that one of the main lessons from Onyx was to \u201cnot get too enamored with your product\u201d. With Smartsheet, he wants to make sure they\u2019re always improving the product and the user experience. He also said that investors don\u2019t buy a stock based on what you\u2019ve done in the past, but what you plan to do. \u201cIf you are always looking at the rear view mirror, then you are not running the business\u201d he said. This is exactly how I want the leaders of companies I invest in to be thinking. He is very forward thinking, customer focused, and humble. There is a lot of evidence to corroborate that he has followed through on the statements he made that day.\n\nOne of the first pieces of evidence I found that supports my thesis of Mark being very focused on the product and user experience is the incredible ratings that the product has received from its customers. I use a tool called Net Promoter Score (NPS) which is one of the most reliable and unbiased ways to find out what a customers true experience with a business is and how likely they would be to recommend it to a friend. For Smartsheet, their NPS is extremely high. It\u2019s on a scale of -100 to 100 so anything above 0 is considered to be good. If the rating is above 0, it essentially more people would recommend the product to a friend than they would tell them not to use it. Smartsheet has an NPS of 80, which is honestly one of the highest I have ever seen.\n\nFurther evidence to support Mark and the rest of management\u2019s commitment to product quality and user experience is the exceptional ratings the product has on the Apple App Store. This is just for the mobile version of the product, the app that you can download on your phone just like you would download the mobile version of Outlook. The rating in the App Store is 4.8/5. That\u2019s very impressive as well.\n\nBased on how customers are responding to the product, I think it\u2019s fair to say that Mark was not [B.S.ing](https://b.s.ing/) his way through that interview on IPO day. He and his management team really have been focused on creating a stellar product and the results are showing. When I say that \u201cDesire and Purpose\u201d are important traits of a leader of a company it means that I want to see a leader who has a real desire to do what he/she is doing as the CEO of the company, believes in their product(s) and services, and has a real purpose for why they want to do that. I can tell that Mark is committed to the mission of improving the way people work. Being one of the founders, and having written an E-Book on the \u201cProductivity Paradox\u201d that I mentioned in Part 1, I think this mission is very near and dear to his heart and that he has a desire to see the impact and scale of his company grow well into the future. As shareholders, that\u2019s what we want.\n\nAnother way to see if the leader of the company has \u201cDesire and Purpose\u201d is to see how his/her employees perceive them. Do the employees look up to this person? Do they feel motivated to work hard because they know what they\u2019re doing is meaningful and can make a positive difference in people\u2019s lives? One way I have of gaining insight into this is to look at the company\u2019s Glassdoor ratings and specifically the rating of the CEO. In the case of Smartsheet, the positive story continues. The company has a 4.1/5 rating on Glassdoor and Mark has a 90% approval rate from his employees which is well above average. To me this shows he\u2019s communicating the company\u2019s purpose to the employees very well and is motivating them to actualize that purpose.\n\nThere\u2019s one other piece of evidence I stumbled upon that gives good insight into the culture that Mark and his management team are building at Smartsheet. They were recently (12/17/20) awarded \u201cBest Company Culture\u201d and \u201cBest Companies for Women\u201d by Comparably. Below you can see a screenshot of the headline from a Business Wire article about this. It\u2019s one thing to be awarded for \u201cBest Company Culture\u201d but to also be a \u201cBest Companies for Women\u201d when you\u2019re in a heavily male dominated industry such as computer software, that really says something. It speaks to the culture of diversity and inclusiveness that Mark is building there which goes a long way in the year 2021 when social issues are at the forefront of people\u2019s minds more than ever. The modern enterprise has to build a culture of diversity and inclusiveness if they want to retain the most talented employees and keep them motivated. Smartsheet is doing a good job of this.\n\nSource \u2013 Smartsheet making headlines for their outstanding company culture.\n\nI think we\u2019ve found a lot of evidence to support that this leadership team has a strong desire to fulfil their purpose. It\u2019s evident that they want to help improve the way people work and that they\u2019ve invested heavily into making this happen while keeping employees motivated and focused on the goal. The last piece I look at for leadership is ownership. Does the CEO have a personal financial stake in the company? This is such a key thing to look for because as I mentioned earlier in the article, if leadership themselves owns a substantial amount of shares, then their interests and motivations will align with us, the shareholders. They essentially are a shareholder too, just like us. On top of the desire and purpose that we\u2019ve established is present, there\u2019s also a financial incentive for Mark and the team to lead the company to success, and ultimately, a higher share price.\n\nCurrently, Mark holds 490,267 shares which comes out to a value of $34 million as of this writing (1/14/21). I\u2019d consider that substantial for an individual person. Even more noteworthy is that Brent owns 3.2 million shares which comes out to a value of $218 million. Brent owns that much of the company still and he\u2019s not even involved beyond being on the Board of Directors. I think that\u2019s a testament to how much confidence he has in Mark to lead Smartsheet to new heights. Also, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that he left Smartsheet to help with his family business. He saw his 80 year old Dad picking up rocks on the farm with his bare hands and realized he wanted to help solve this problem in the farming industry. Leaving Smartsheet was not like when he left Onyx because the business was plateauing. As a matter of fact, Smartsheet was rapidly growing at that time and was about to go public. The fact that he still has $218 million worth of shares in the company shows he still believes in the company and what Mark can do with it now and in the future.\n\nThis concludes Part 2 of my Smartsheet deep dive.

        "selftext": "So far I'm going with Jeff Bezos' investing philosophy he outlined in one of his interviews. To just pick a bunch of high risk, high reward long term opportunities, and invest in all of them. If any one or multiple of them pan out, then it'll easily make up for the losers.\n\nSo far I've decided to just completely ignored index funds. Instead I'm just DCAing into whatever I find has huge long term potential based off of what reddit, youtube, motley fool or ARK has hyped up. 80% of my portfolio is in BTC, ETH, TSLA, SQ, LMND, DKNG, uranium stocks, and ARK ETFs (weighted to ARKG).

(not ready to use my whole $15k life savings yet) which stocks should i hop on? is it worth it to get only 1 or 2 pcs of shares of the big name stocks like Apple or Microsoft, Disney, etc.?\n\nI would appreciate any advice i could get.\n\nThanks \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffc",

        "selftext": "**Stocks end 2020 on the high note with Tesla closing over 700$. Is Lemonade overvalued? FuboTv keeps on crumbling while NIO posts great sales numbers, let\u2019s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of the last trading day of 2020, as we saw both the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/bHgX2sf) and the [Dow Jones Industrial](https://ibb.co/D471c7X) finish up over 0.60% and finishing at record highs, while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/vzGgSBb)  finished barely up for the day, gaining .14%. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/2YrvMpT) finishing just down for the day, but it\u2019s still up from a [week](https://ibb.co/LxdGJ8c) ago, as the volatility still remains way above the [levels](https://ibb.co/XbWkzW4) before March when it rose to over 80.\n\nWe just about saw a positive ratio of companies [advancing](https://ibb.co/5TwrM2m) to close out the year as the volume was belove average with just 100 new highs, as we saw 10 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/yyrTGGP) finishing in the green with Utilities, Financials, Real Estate &amp; Health Care gaining more than 1% while Energy was the only sector to finish the day with a loss.  \nWe also saw most factor groups [finishing](https://ibb.co/dmvNJgL) the day in the red with only Large-Cap Value companies posting a gain of .3%, as you can see in Thursday\u2019s [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/wBGr7cR) with gains all around the board, while losses were concentrated in the Biotech and Oil &amp; Gas industry.\n\nHere is the weekly [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/zQWD12B) with names like Alibaba, Shopify, Palantir, Square and Zoom being some of the biggest losers, while TESLA continued to push higher as Tesla finished the month of [December](https://ibb.co/ZX09X8Z) with a gain of more than 20% as you can see here, while many of the other big tech names also had a strong month, with most of the losses being concentrated in the communication sector and of course Alibaba which was hit by a lot of negative news.\n\nWe also [finished](https://ibb.co/r5JRk5b) the year with most sectors in the green as you can see here, led by Technology, Consumer Cyclicals and Communications. But gains were had in most other sectors as well, except the Financial, Travel and Energy sectors, which finished the year down.\n\nThe biggest [losers](https://ibb.co/nDgRs1S) in the SP500 which finished the year up more than 16% were by far stocks like Carnival, OXY, Norwegian Cruise Line, United Airlines and many more others. The Nasdaq 100 wasn\u2019t safe either despite jumping almost 50% in 2020, having the best gains in 11years, with companies like Walgreens, Fox and Intel posting losses of over 17%, while the Dow was the laggard finishing just over 7% up for the year as Boeing, Chevron and Intel dragged the index lower.\n\nWe also saw huge [winners](https://ibb.co/n7yP7cM)  in 2020, as the SP500 was led higher by stocks like Apple, Nvidia, PayPal, Amazon and many others that posted huge gains. While the Nasdaq 100 jumped to record highs lead by Tesla which posted an incredible year with other stocks like Moderna, Peloton &amp; Zoom also rising by more than 300%. The Dow also had big winners but still lagged as the biggest gainers here were the tech giants Apple &amp; Microsoft joined by some other stocks like Nike, Disney &amp; Salesforce.\n\nWe also got some economic data since Thursday as Macau\u2019s gaming [revenue](https://ibb.co/NWBrC3s) continued the slow recovery, but the visits in the travel dependent region were 20% higher in the Holiday period compared to the start of December, which may be another positive sign for the Macau Gambling business.\n\nMeanwhile we also received the latest jobless [numbers](https://ibb.co/Km8px8X), which dipped below 800K again, 19K less than last week and more than 40K less than expected, as the continuing jobless claims also fell to just over 5.2M more than 100K better than expected and the previous [report](https://ibb.co/gJLQYPB).\n\nWhile this [week](https://ibb.co/mDnXFZY) we start to receive important economic data that alongside the results of the Georgia runoff election might push the market either to more gains, or if the results and data don\u2019t show up as investors &amp; analysts expected it, we might see an increase in volatility again which will lead to a market pullback or correction, which in my opinion would be a good time to go out and find deals to buy again.\n\nWe also really don\u2019t get any significant [earnings](https://ibb.co/60QM77h) releases this week, with most of the interesting ones like Micron, Walgreens &amp; Bed Bath &amp; Beyond coming on Thursday.\n\nSo, in some other stock market news, Tesla topped [expectations](https://ibb.co/g9048Ry) of 163K deliveries in Q4 again but did finish just shy of the 500K mark. The company delivered more than 180K vehicle in the last quarter, as we saw [Tesla](https://ibb.co/th7Hhnc)  pricing the model Y at just over $50.000 in China and are expecting to start deliveries this month as they keep expanding their sales in the world\u2019s biggest car market, as they are targeting to make this their biggest market surpassing the US. Tesla closed over 700$ for the first time and if you want to see my opinion on this stock, check out my prediction on Tesla [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kci2lk/my_tesla_stock_price_predictions_buy_or_sell/).\n\nSome other EV makers from China also posted sales numbers with [Li Auto](https://ibb.co/LYCSs1N) increasing deliveries five-fold year/year with a 32% increase month/month in December, while [XPENG](https://ibb.co/Zc7FSQC) also announced record delivery numbers up 35% month/month and more than 300% year/year for December. We also saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/4VWGX78) posting a monthly deliveries record of just over 7K, up over 120% year/year and finishing the year with over 43K deliveries, which were also up over 110% year/year, as they are also planning on revealing some new sedan models and their latest developments on self-driving and other technologies next week.\n\nMeanwhile we saw [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/dKh6kx0) take a ride after another short-seller released a statement, pointing out to the final lock-up period after the IPO, as a moment that will bring huge selling to this stock, despite the [company](https://ibb.co/YWksq6g) needing just over 4 years to reach the first million customers, less than 5 times the time it took companies like StateFarm, Geico and Allstate to reach their first million. I personally am an investor in this company, and I really like what they are doing, so I am not going to sell my shares anytime soon.\n\nGuys, personally I can\u2019t wait to see the sales numbers and how the services business is growing for [Apple](https://ibb.co/cx07jJs) as the top-of-the-line products keep having great demand, but we do have to see what happens in the US-China relations, as this could impact the Apple revenue stream, this after the New York Stock Exchange has [started](https://ibb.co/599nrxc) the process of delisting telecom giants from China. You can check out my prediction on Apple [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kmzvqv/apple_stock_price_predictions_buy_or_sell_aapl/)\n\nWe also saw a [memo](https://ibb.co/qyBfzrq) from DELTA\u2019s CEO, as he expects the company to return to positive cashflow in the spring, as they are planning to start paying down debt as soon as that happens to reduce the burden the company has taken on since March 2020.\n\nMeanwhile [FuboTV](https://ibb.co/Dg5jZ6x) continues its sharp decline after a number of firms have started to short the stock pointing to insane valuations and outlook. Fubo plunged again almost 16% Thursday and is down almost 50% in the past week as the IPO lockup period expired, more than tripling the shares float.\n\nAnd on last piece of news that just came out is that [Roku](https://ibb.co/gM8Z4Bv) is looking to buy the content catalog from Quibi, this would give a boost to Roku\u2019s exclusive programming, as the stock has seen an immediate reaction and is up over 3.5% in pre-market trading.\n\nLet\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/zf9tMYZ) seem to be pointing at a good open, with the SP500 leading the way to start off the year as we wait to receive the first economic [data](https://ibb.co/f24tRCS) this year in the early morning, while the global stock [markets](https://ibb.co/sjvZMrx) started on a positive note except Japan.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!
