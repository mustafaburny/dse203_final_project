        "selftext": "Quick question to everyone that was involved, on the morning of the 27th, were you able to trade options at 9:30 am?\n\nI have a trade dispute with my broker and they are claiming that the primary market didn't open until 9:43 am and trading options a few seconds after that at a price of $297 which is when I could sell. However, I show on NYSE and Gamestop's investor relations that the opening price was $354.\n\nI was up and active in the pre-market watching the price and when open happened I was unable to sell my options until \\~15 minutes later. I saw volume on the ticker during those times and the price of the options change on other brokerage platforms.\n\nIf anyone knows of any website with historical options trade information or at the very least can corroborate what I saw (maybe even trade data) I would greatly appreciate it. The dispute is for a large sum and I don't want to have to go FINRA arbitration.\n\n**Edit: Due to my low karma I am unable to directly reply to the comments. I want to assert that they are trying to say that the NASDAQ did not open until 9:43 AM EST and I believe that to be false based on other brokerage price action (Robinhood/Webull).**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Edit 2: I did some digging based on** u/meta-cognizant **suggestion of marketchameleon. I downloaded the options transaction log for 01/27/2021 and to my surprise my brokerage is 100% absolutely correct which blew my mind. Options did not start trading until 9:43:52 AM.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: Brokerage was correct and options activity was not started until 09:43:52 AM EST on 01/27/2021.**",

So the margin is very thin and it can\u2019t compete for long with well entraced services companies like Accenture, Cognizant etc..\n* C3 customer base is not Unicorn next generation startups growing 50% but outdated companies which are discovering that they should use technology. So it builds a custom product for each of it\u2019s customer which is not repeatable or salable to other customers as the customer paid for the project\n* The business model is not subscription based. So, deal like a service company is closed with manpower and material cost and maintenance at the end. \n\nAlways remember C3 is not a AI company, it is not a Product company and it caters to companies which have no growth.\n\nGet out before this shit hit\u2019s the Fan.",

        "selftext": "**Not popular topics for those who expect the high tech momentum will dominate the most gains in stock market forever.** ***It is time to review one's portfolio to adjust and factor into risk translate to a resonable reward even when the market chills.*** \n\nPersonnel issues and lax risk controls loom large here.\n\n[**Robby Greengold, CFA**](https://www.morningstar.com/authors/2146/robby-greengold)Mar 31, 2021\n\n [ARK Innovation ETF\u00a0(ARKK)](https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/arcx/arkk/quote), [American Beacon ARK Transfmt Innov A\u00a0(ADNAX)](https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/adnax/quote)\n\nThematic-investing specialist ARK Investment Management has been in tune with the market\u2019s unfolding narrative in recent years, but its lone portfolio manager, inexperienced team, and lax risk controls make it ill-prepared to grapple with a major plot twist. Its flagship strategy, ARK Innovation ([ARKK](https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/arcx/arkk/quote)), earns a Morningstar Analyst Rating of Neutral.\n\n## The Pitch and the Niche\n\nARK believes that equity indexes are full of value traps in danger of technological obsolescence and that traditional asset managers hew too closely to their benchmarks, thereby loading themselves up with stocks in [doomed industries](https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ARK-Invest/White_Papers/ArkInvest_101420_Whitepaper_BadIdeas2020.pdf). Its solution is to invest across five technology platforms--artificial intelligence, blockchain, DNA sequencing, energy storage, and robotics--that it thinks will revolutionize how economic sectors across the globe operate.\n\nTrue to form, the firm\u2019s products look unlike any index. The portfolio of its flagship strategy, ARK Innovation, is top-heavy, makes huge industry bets, and has historically invested in publicly traded companies of virtually every size. It embraces money-losing companies so long as they\u2019re aggressively investing to exceed their already high growth expectations.\n\nThe firm defines success differently from most long-only funds. Rather than aim to outperform an index, the firm cares most about achieving high returns and invests only in companies it thinks will gain 15% or more annualized over the next five years. That hurdle is roughly double the annualized return of the Russell Mid Cap Growth Index (the fund\u2019s category benchmark) since 2000.\n\nThe firm\u2019s etf lineup has done far better than that. Its flagship strategy, which combines ideas expressed in its six other actively managed ETFs, gained 150% in 2020. A flood of inflows followed. Over the 12 months through February 2021, the firm\u2019s total assets under management leapt to roughly $80 billion from less than $12 billion.\n\nThe firm is shareholder-friendly in some ways. It has developed its product lineup thoughtfully by maintaining its focus on the handful of innovation platforms and underlying technologies it thinks have longevity. Its ETFs are cost-competitive relative to actively managed rivals.\n\nBut few features of its research team or process suggest ARK Innovation will continue to beat the Russell Mid Cap Growth Index on a risk-adjusted basis.\n\n## The Key Person\n\nARK\u2019s main draw is its founder, chief executive officer, and portfolio manager Cathie Wood, who, after more than three decades in the industry, launched the firm in 2014.\n\n## MORE ON THIS TOPIC\n\n* [**No Room on the ARK?**](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1027682/no-room-on-the-ark)\n\nShe honed her thematic-oriented process at AllianceBernstein from 2001 to 2013, where she ran several strategies similar to this one that had high volatility, poor downside performance, and underwhelming long-term results during her tenure. During her 12 years at the helm of large-growth separate account AB MA Strategic Research, its before-fee total returns comfortably outpaced the Russell 1000 Growth Index *but lagged on a risk-adjusted basis*. She also managed two growth-oriented mutual funds--one focused on domestic mid-caps, the other on global stocks--whose net-of-fee results underperformed their bogies on her watch, risk-adjusted or otherwise.\n\nAnd yet, as ARK\u2019s primary investment decision-maker who has established a ubiquitous media presence and enthusiastic following, Wood is essential to the firm\u2019s continued success. Director of research Brett Winton would likely succeed her if needed, but his nearly 15 years of industry experience include none as a portfolio manager. Exacerbating that key-person risk is the firm\u2019s inability to develop and retain talent: Many of the analysts supporting the funds\u2019 research have come and gone, and most of the remaining nine\u00a0lack deep industry experience.\n\n## Not Your Typical Analyst Team\n\nThe firm\u2019s analyst bench is [distinct](https://ark-invest.com/the-ark-difference/) from traditional asset managers, but not in a good way. The typical equity research analyst in the asset management industry has a predictable set of credentials: an undergraduate degree from a name-brand institution, some entry-level work experience, an MBA, an analytical internship, and at least some progress toward investment-related credentials, such as becoming a CFA charterholder. Almost none of ARK's analysts have progress beyond earning bachelor's degrees.\n\nIndeed, ARK\u2019s research-related job postings [tend not](https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ARK-Invest/Job_Positions/Job_Opportunity_Analyst-Fintech.pdf) to demand credentials of any kind. That sort of openness expands the applicant pool and invites individuals of various backgrounds and experiences to submit their resumes. The firm may be on to something there. Cognitively diverse teams can be more creative or innovative than those without a variety of perspectives. (1)\n\nInvesting Insights\n\nTop investment picks and tips anytime, anywhere\n\n[Listen Now](https://msmedia.morningstar.com/mstar/adclick/FCID=129694/site=ms.us/pgid=Kessler/area=Articles/topic=EXCHANGETRADEDFUNDS/collection=2/authorId=2146/subtopic1=VOLATILITY/random=27992636/viewid=27657263/usrt=v/size=dynamicoffer/pos=offer1/pgid=articleoffer/relocate=https://www.morningstar.com/podcasts/investing-insights)\n\nBut this team\u2019s collective experience seems significantly more limited than that of other firms. Only about half the current team came to ARK with a history of full-time work.\n\n## Crowdsourcing\n\nARK outsources much of the technical expertise to \u201c[theme developers](https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ARK-Invest/Marketing_Material/ARK-Invest-Thematic-Investment-Process.pdf)\u201d--some of whom the firm says are academics, entrepreneurs, and former ARK analysts--who donate their time. It also invites feedback on its research and new investment ideas from individuals following the firm through social media. These features make the firm\u2019s process of gathering and digesting information unique, but its analytical edge remains unclear in an industry that provides (for a fee) subject-matter experts to advise shops that lack requisite technical know-how.\n\n## A Peculiar Analyst Coverage Model\n\nWood [thinks](https://youtu.be/-hnK2cEvbJg?t=350) other asset managers set up their analyst teams poorly to comprehend the potential impact of these technologies on the economy. Rather than assigning analysts coverage of economic sectors--a common industry practice that Wood thinks creates information silos--ARK assigns them one or more technological specialties. For example, [one](https://ark-invest.com/our-team/) analyst covers energy storage, robotics, and reusable rockets; another covers automation, robotics, energy storage, alternate energy, and space exploration.\n\nWood has a point. Technology is crucial to both its purveyors and consumers and influences the sales and expenses of companies across all industries. It follows that analysts who can accurately forecast the accessibility, cost declines, and adoption rates of the most promising innovations could have a stock-picking advantage. But her views on this don\u2019t radically diverge from her competitors. Many recognize the downsides of industry specialization and try to mitigate them by fostering collaboration across sectors or implementing a generalist approach.\n\nIn some ways, ARK\u2019s setup could lead to ultra-specialization and potential blind spots that better resourced firms wouldn\u2019t miss. For example, it assigns DNA sequencing, genome editing, and immunotherapy to two analysts who are early in their careers and at a disadvantage to their healthcare-focused rivals. The teams of other shops collaborate to cover biotech, pharma, and life-sciences firms in breadth and depth and staff their teams with seasoned analysts holding doctorates or other advanced degrees in medicine, biology, or neuroscience.\n\n## Unrestrained, Unaware, and Unconcerned\n\nARK Innovation\u2019s benchmark agnosticism and high return targets saddle the portfolio with risks that Wood manages mainly with instinct rather than data or rules. The firm, which has no risk management personnel, views the subject almost exclusively through the lens of its scoring system that monitors six inputs to a stock\u2019s investment thesis. They are:\n\n1) Company, People, and Culture  \n2) Execution  \n3) Moats: Barriers to Entry  \n4) Product Leadership  \n5) Valuation  \n6) Thesis Risk\n\nThese form the basis of levelheaded bottom-up research--most investment teams use some variation of them--but they provide little visibility into the portfolio\u2019s aggregate risk exposures.\n\nWood assembles the portfolio one stock at a time, using each stock\u2019s cumulative scores as a guide to position sizing. But these scores say nothing of each stock\u2019s sources of risk and return, which may be highly and undesirably correlated to one another. There [is potential](https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ARK-Invest/White_Papers/ARKInvest_052720_whitepaper_Innovation-Allocation.pdf) for diversification across innovation platforms--but the firm\u2019s self-categorization of its investable universe does not by itself imply a rigorous understanding of which stocks are likely to rise, fall, succeed, and fail together. Forward-looking estimates of the holdings\u2019 correlations and variances or other input from a separate risk-management team, on the other hand, would do more. (2)\n\nSuch analysis is complex and nonessential for most of this strategy\u2019s rivals. That\u2019s because the typical long-only equity strategy defines its risk limit and stays within it, for example, by anchoring its sector weights to prevent extreme sector concentration. ARK has few portfolio construction parameters. It has said it will generally invest no more than around 10% of ARK Innovation\u2019s assets in a single company (it has adhered to this guidance) and no more than half of ARK Innovation\u2019s assets in a single technology.\n\nTo be sure, ARK makes no promise to diversify its portfolios, and it [tells investors](https://youtu.be/Qb8uQSQi8bc?t=396) to expect volatility. But even a high-octane strategy like this one should be cognizant of the risks embedded in its portfolio and manage to a definable risk tolerance. It seems not to. Indeed, on March 29, 2021, the fund removed prospectus language limiting the size of its top positions and its ownership percentage of individual companies\u2019 shares outstanding.\n\n## Blind to the Future\n\nThe portfolio has become less liquid and more vulnerable to severe losses as its size has swelled. In the 12 months ended February 2021, the ETF\u2019s assets under management grew more than tenfold to over $23 billion. It has retained and grown its stakes in small companies that are now much more difficult to sell without [materially impacting](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1027682) their stock prices. Across all U.S.-domiciled funds, the ETF stood out in February for having the most concentration in companies in which it owned 10% or more of floating shares--that doesn\u2019t even include additional vehicles tied to the strategy, which combined amount to another $15 billion.\n\nThe firm has [minimized](https://ark-funds.com/innovation-webinar-series/capacity-and-liquidity-analysis) the notion that the ETF\u2019s *downside has become steeper*, mostly by relying on the past as a guide to the future. But its heft is new, and future market crises will be different from previous ones. Without risk-management professionals to stress-test the portfolio\u2019s risk exposures, estimate its potential losses during historical or hypothetical market environments, and gauge worst-case scenarios, the team is poorly positioned to prepare and react.\n\nBut even with such a team, there\u2019s no sign that Wood would heed its advice. A central tenet of her process is to amplify exposure to the fund\u2019s riskiest holdings when market uncertainty is highest. In a market crisis, her game plan is to sell first the fund\u2019s \u201ccashlike\u201d stocks--those that possess the most diversified sources of revenue, are typically large cap, and are the most liquid--to favor as few as 32 \u201cpure plays\u201d that are often unprofitable small caps that are less liquid and extremely volatile.\n\nShe followed a much milder version of this playbook at AllianceBernstein\u2019s Strategic Research strategy\u00a0during the market\u2019s 2008 implosion. There, she consolidated the portfolio to 47 or so stocks and kept it focused on liquid large caps. It did not have anywhere near the level of ownership in individual companies as ARK Innovation has today. In 2008, that large-growth-oriented separate account lost 45% before fees--substantially worse than the Russell 1000 Growth Index\u2019s 38% decline.\n\nOther potential consequences of the strategy's size are less dire but hinder its ability to exploit good ideas and oust bad ones. Nimble execution is now tougher than before. To mitigate market-impact costs, ARK must build new positions more slowly and exit gradually. But its bullish or bearish signals are available for all to see--as an ETF, the strategy must disclose its portfolios to the market each day--and traders can respond either by buying up a stock\u2019s known supply (putting upward pressure on its price) or selling it (downward pressure) before ARK has offloaded its own position. (2)\n\n## Reasonable Doubts\n\nARK\u2019s pursuit of disruptive innovators has merit, and its quest for big rewards may appeal to aggressive investors who can stomach the risk of potentially heavy losses. But ARK\u2019s team of inexperienced analysts, go-with-your-gut risk management approach, and bloated asset base raise doubts about whether this fund\u2019s outstanding historical results can continue.\n\n## Works Cited\n\n*1.
