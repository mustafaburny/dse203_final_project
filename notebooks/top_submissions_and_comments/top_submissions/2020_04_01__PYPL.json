        "selftext": "I'll keep this short. Protesters have been [chanting outside the Ohio state house](https://www.foxnews.com/us/ohio-dewine-protest-end-social-distancing-reopen-economy-coronavirus) for a couple of days now, blaming the local health department officials for keeping the state closed and calling for it to open back up. What's my takeaway here? We all know lots of folks are in denial and we have been expecting our puts to print as the bad news keeps hitting, but the market keeps going up. The reality is, many folk haven't been hit hard by illness of friends dying, partly because of social distancing and all the state closures. Yet many have been hurt by furloughs, layoffs, and pay cuts. Many still agree with the president's sentiment to open back up, and feel it will happen. Short term, this is why calls are printing, and long term, this is probably why puts will print. People think the worst is over and that once the states reopen, things will go back to normal. Of course, they won't, so there's still more shock to come.\n\nPositions: ZM 160-170 spreads for May 1, Paypal $110-120 calls for 4/17 or 4/24, BA 125, CBRL 75 puts for May 15 or beyond.",

        "selftext": " This will be the first and last time I post. \n\nWhy first ? I\u2019m posting because I\u2019ve seen some retarded DD on here last 2 days that would offend retarded people. \n\nWhy Last ? I got better things to do. \n\nMy credentials ?  Insider in this space for over 10 years.    ( excuse the grammars. English is my fourth language). \n\nThis is a very dumbed down version as I can\u2019t very well write 100 pages on wsb post.  There are books, seminars, certifications on this stuffs. \n\nCredit Card processing is very important as it\u2019s a key indicator for consumers spending.   Scroll down for  Puts/Calls.\n\n**Parties Involved to make it work ?**\n\n1.) Consumer   --- end user. Credit Card holder. \n\n2.) Merchant   --- Business establishment accepting  payment. These guys pay out all the fees\n\n3.) Card Brand   ---- Visa, Mastercard, Discover (Diner Club,  Union Pay), American Express, \n\n4.) Sponsoring Bank   --- handles risks, daily balancing, funding the merchant. \n\n5.) Issuing Bank --- Issue the credit card. If your credit card say \u201c Chase\u201d, then Chase is the issuing bank. \n\n6.) Processor  --- transactions run through these guys. Think of them as a highway to run  and verify transactions\n\n7.) ISO --- Independent sales office. These guys are the one who call business to sign them up with \u201c use my company  \n\n for cheaper rates\u201d \n\n**How**  **does each Parties make money ?** \n\n1.) Consumer --- they don\u2019t  anything as they are the purchaser.\n\n2.) Merchant --- they pay out all the fees. At the end of the month, they get a bill for the privilege of being able to accept credit card.  \n\n3.) Card Brand --- Card Brand is pretty much god. They make about 15% of total fees paid out to merchant.   Look up  FANF, dues &amp; assessments. If Visa need money, they just increase their rates, that\u2019s it. More on this later. \n\n4.) Sponsoring Bank -- these guys make the least out of everyone in the group. About  0.01% -0.03%  ( 1 to 3 BP) of total processing volume.  \n\n5.) Issuing bank -- \u201cinterchange\u201d is paid out to the issuing bank. These fees account for about 75% of all total fees.  Card Brand dictate interchange. I\u2019m not going to go into qualifications, etc\u2026.. Interchange rates is publish for each card brand. Look it up. \n\n6.) Processor --- these guys usually make money on per transaction counts. About $0.02 -$0.05 per transaction and bunch of other misc fees. \n\n7.) ISO --- whatever is left over goes to the sales group.  In a normal business niche ( not high risk or CBD/ cannabis), profit is about 0.30% - 0.50% of total processing volume. \n\n**Profit Math**\n\nMerchant\u2019s fee \u2013 ( issuing bank + card brand ) = ISO\u2019 Gross - ( Processor + Sponsoring Bank) = ISO\u2019s Net.\n\n \n\n**Fees:** \n\nAlways have 2 parts.   \n\na.)  Percentage  multiply by the processing volume. \n\nb.)  Fix charge multiply by the transaction.\n\nWhat if you as a sales office  charged merchant 2.75% ( SQUARE) and  nothing else? you would  net negative on any transactions under $10 and  net positive on any transaction over $40.00\n\nWhy ? because interchange for a signature regulated debit is  0.05%+ $0.22( per transaction) not including all the other costs. \n\n**State of the world.**\n\nAll 50 states have stay-at-home orders. Some states are talking about opening up again ( GA, FL).  Guess what ? it\u2019s the Consumers who\u2019s going to decide when to \u201copen\u201d up. Household spending account for 70% of annual GDP. \n\nThe rest of the world is on lock down. Even after opening up, it\u2019s still bad. \n\n[https://www.barrons.com/articles/chinas-reopening-is-missing-consumers-thats-a-bad-sign-for-u-s-51587476793](https://www.barrons.com/articles/chinas-reopening-is-missing-consumers-thats-a-bad-sign-for-u-s-51587476793)\n\n**Great\u2026\u2026**  **Give me puts or calls\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..**\n\n1.) Card Brand   ---- \n\na. Visa ( V)  -- earning is on 04/30. They are  the god in this business. They have the greatest exposure in US and overseas. There is no place in asia or Europe that does not take Visa. They increase their rates twice a year. Rate increases scheduled for this April was pushed back to July.  Their earnings will be absolutely horrible as the rest of the world started shutting down in Feb and US in march. \n\ni.  Waiting to be fill --- V 01 May $160P  \n\nii. Waiting to be fill --- V 19 June $135P \n\nb. Mastercard -- earning is on 04/29 -- They have the second highest processing in US. Also like Visa. If you are playing earning, any puts within 5% will be good. \n\nc. Discover ( DFS)  (Diner Club,  Union Pay) --- Earning  4/22 -- I had  15 X $2.72 01 May $34C going into earning. CALLS?? WTF?? 1.) they announced dividends right before earnings. 2.) They own debit networks. Think grocery stores, liquor stores, cannabis shops. 3.) Dinner club, union pay, paypal all goes through them to process on a traditional level. \n\nResults: \n\nQ1 GAAP EPS of -$0.25 misses by $1.61.\n\nRevenue of $2.89B (+4.7% Y/Y) beats by $10M.\n\nShares -5.3% AH.\n\nGoing to exit my position at open with probably 40% losses. \n\nThis is good, if  DFS  missed by bad, the rest will be way way worst. \n\nd. American Express ( AXP) ---  rich people\u2019s credit card. \n\n2.) Sponsoring Bank   ---\n\na. FITB -- 4/21 --  missed earning. Went down on 4/21 then went back up. \n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n3.) Issuing Bank --- I would not touch issuing bank as they are too diversified.\n\na. Chase\n\nb. Bank of America\n\n4.) Processor  -- do your own research.  \n\na. Global Payments\n\nb. Fiserv\n\n**Other:** \n\nSQ ( Square) -- earning 05/06. I did not talked about Payment facilitator. Which is kinda of what they are.   Here was a post on here  \u201c Square InC, SQ Puts\u2014let\u2019s be rational. Right direction but wrong DD. \n\nSquare  is all domestic and make their money primary from \n\n1.)  Credit Card processing --- they will give merchant, 2.75% or $275 total fees. Their credit card processing  is net negative since inception. The reason is because of their client base ( mom and pop, start up, small transactions type businesses). 2.75% is a good percentage on volume but the $0.00 per swipe is killing them by the time they have to pay out interchanges  and dues assessments.  Their average ticket have to be over $25.00 to be profit. But the business model will not allow it. Small mom and pop go to them because lax underwriting,  and it\u2019s a lot easier vs a traditional model. Most of their merchants is under 10k in processing. \n\n2.) Hardware sales  --- very minimal 1 time revenue \n\n3.) SAS ( Service as a subscription) -- Minimal revenue when comparing to credit card processing. They are also waiving all the software subscription fees for the month of April. \n\n4.) Others\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\n**I WOULD NOT TOUCH SQUARE.** \n\n1.)  In fintech, you don\u2019t need to be making money. You can have years of losses and stock will go up. Why ? because it\u2019s about acquiring a large merchant base. \n\n2.) Jack Dorsey -- yes the Twitter guy. He\u2019s the founder and ceo of Square. He\u2019s the Elon Musk of this  space. And you don\u2019t mess with papa  Elon. \n\n3.)  SQ is  APPROVED to make Emergency Small-Business Coronavirus loans.

What are your guys opinion on the matter?

        "selftext": "I've read the most important thing by Howard Marks, and he suggests investing in undervalued stocks because they have less risk, will drop less, and are more consistant. Also, no stock is so good that it can be bought too high, and often low quality companies are a better investment than quality companies that are overvalued, because their price is bid up so high that it lowers the return and increases risk because these companies are less consistent with market cycle fluctuations. He also says that the top thing investors should do is minimize losses almost like a batting average.\n\nHowever, Philip Fisher in Common Stocks and Uncommon profits suggests that bargain stocks may have business troubles and that's the reason they're valued so low. Also, it could take years for an undervalued stock to adjust, and that growth stocks should be used by investors because they will increase earnings the greatest, they have better profit margins, and growth stocks have a higher value because they are superbly managed.\n\nSo, is growth or value better long term. It does seem that the growth companies are much better ex: Visa, Msft, Shopify, Tesla, Okta, Paypal, Square, but their valuations are so crazy high that even the coronavirus fears hardly brought down their PE. Or are value stocks better ex: hanes, big lots, halliburton, LMT, PFE, Citibank, a lot of financial stocks, beaten down oil stocks etc. A lot of these stocks are beaten down and probably won't rise much, but have good dividends. And the growth stocks listed above will rise a lot more, but Marks said something that is overvalued can't be overvalued forever. But won't the value stocks drop in a recession too, and a lot of value companies have huge financial troubles, low earnings, or are slow moving stalwarts with no growth.\n\nWhat do you all think is better then long term value or growth?",

Corona is appearing to be fading out, people are warning of a second wave for the fall but for now the coast seems to be clear, at least financially speaking. I should also point out I mean forecasts, not the literal economic landscape I\u2019m aware 50% of Americans are living on $400 a week so that\u2019s pretty bleak, but I can\u2019t fix that and neither can you.\n\nMoving on \u2014 this is a very big ER week. You don\u2019t want to miss out on the big swings that will surely happen. Don\u2019t believe me? Look at $MMM and $CMI that\u2019s a quick and easy 10%, you just have to time it properly. I don\u2019t have any specific financial data, but even I did, would you even read it?\n\nBuy these fucking stocks at open and I can assure you there will be profits to be had:\n\n$TSLA\n\n$V\n\n$MA\n\n$AAPL\n\n$PYPL\n\n$MSFT\n\n$FB\n\n$TWTR\n\n$MCD\n\n$CMCSA\n\n$CI\n\n$CVX\n\n$XOM\n\nI can\u2019t tell you which ones will have the biggest % moves...\n\nbut I can speculate that after ER:\n\n$TSLA to $900\n\n$FB to $200\n\n$V to $190\n\n$MA to $280\n\n$MSFT to $180\n\n$CMCSA to $40\n\n$PYPL to $125\n\n\nGood luck \ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffb",

        "selftext": "Saw more and more posts on this topic recently. It seems 5G is getting more and more attentions from the investors. \n\nHere let me ask you, what were the best winner stocks during the 3G transition, or 4G transition? As we knew that 3G or 4G were quite big jump at their times. I bet you cannot name a single winner stock who directly involved in 3G and 4G tech. I cannot, and I am quite tech savvy (an old software engineer from another country). However, we do know who benefit from the 3G and 4G technology.\n\nIMO, the biggest winner from 4G jump are: Apple, Netflix, Google.  Not ATT, Tmobile, Motorola,  Nokia. Companies like Apple benefited tremendously from the 4G technology. \n\nSo my point is that we need to focus more on the \"5G enabled\" (services that will thrive with 5G) instead of \"5G enabler\" (5G infrastructure like Nokia or Huawei or whatever lesser known company).\n\nThen what will be the \"5G enabled\"? Tbh i just don't know. My best bets are\n\n* Video games, especially mobile games. VR/AR maybe\n* social network service, old and new, FB\n* Different forms of video streaming: netflix, tiktok, twitch\n* e-commence and related: amazon, paypal, V, sq, etsy.\n\nSo you see, most of them are the \"golden oldies\": MSFT, AAPL, NFLX, GOOG, AMZN. I will just go for them.\n\n  \nTL;DR:  just go for QQQ or VGT for 5G hype.",

        "selftext": "I've read the most important thing by Howard Marks, and he suggests investing in undervalued stocks because they have less risk, will drop less, and are more consistant. Also, no stock is so good that it can be bought too high, and often low quality companies are a better investment than quality companies that are overvalued, because their price is bid up so high that it lowers the return and increases risk because these companies are less consistent with market cycle fluctuations. He also says that the top thing investors should do is minimize losses almost like a batting average.\n\nHowever, Philip Fisher in Common Stocks and Uncommon profits suggests that bargain stocks may have business troubles and that's the reason they're valued so low. Also, it could take years for an undervalued stock to adjust, and that growth stocks should be used by investors because they will increase earnings the greatest, they have better profit margins, and growth stocks have a higher value because they are superbly managed.\n\nSo, is growth or value better long term. It does seem that the growth companies are much better ex: Visa, Msft, Shopify, Tesla, Okta, Paypal, Square, but their valuations are so crazy high that even the coronavirus fears hardly brought down their PE. Or are value stocks better ex: hanes, big lots, halliburton, LMT, PFE, Citibank, a lot of financial stocks, beaten down oil stocks etc. A lot of these stocks are beaten down and probably won't rise much, but have good dividends. And the growth stocks listed above will rise a lot more, but Marks said something that is overvalued can't be overvalued forever. But won't the value stocks drop in a recession too, and a lot of value companies have huge financial troubles, low earnings, or are slow moving stalwarts with no growth.\n\nWhat do you all think is better then long term value or growth?",

        "selftext": "TLDR: 50% of Square's revenue comes from processing in-store transactions for physical merchants.\u00a0 SQ said transactions volumes for all its merchants were down 25% on March 24th, but estimates from Opentable and other sources suggest things have gotten a lot worse since then. \u00a045% of $SQ's transactions revenue comes from small merchants doing less than $125k in payments through it each year, and as much as 60% of SQ's overall revenues could come from restaurants, retail, and SMB \"services\" (like your wife's boyfriend).\u00a0 Based on how Germany, China, and Korea have been recovering, small merchants will likely not get their in-store revenues back to normal until Spring 2021.\u00a0 In spite of all this, since late Feb, the stock has outperformed its peers by 700 bps and the S%P by 1900 bps, as management talks up how their Cash App can earn a bunch of money being an intermediary for the JPOW SMB loans and TrumpBuxx.\u00a0 However, even all that is unlikely to offset what very rough math indicates will be up to 75% of their EBITDA going away for the year.\u00a0 SQ's next earnings call is May 6th.  \n1. What is Square?  \nSquare offers payment services for small businesses through credit card and touchless dongles it gives merchants.\u00a0 It gets a \\~1% cut after interchange fees for this service.  \n[https://jumbotron-production-f.squarecdn.com/assets/84657895c610afea678d.jpg](https://jumbotron-production-f.squarecdn.com/assets/84657895c610afea678d.jpg)  \n[https://solidshop-production-f.squarecdn.com/spree/images/31/modal/tile-contactless-chip-reader.jpg](https://solidshop-production-f.squarecdn.com/spree/images/31/modal/tile-contactless-chip-reader.jpg)  \nIn case you're wondering, you have to be in a store to pay via these pieces of injection-molded art.  \nThey also offer a cash app and working capital loans to the small businesses they've signed up.  \n2. Who uses Square?  \nThis guy, and people like him:  \n[https://imgur.com/a/SIqjItY](https://imgur.com/a/SIqjItY)  \nMeet Chef Romeo of Romeo Chocolates in Long Beach, California.\u00a0 When he's not busy making artisanal chocolate, he's getting his photo slapped onto page one of Square's 2019 Annual Report.  \n3. Are they still using Square?  \nNo. Square claims they have an ecommerce api like Paypal or Stripe / Shopify, but adoption is low.\u00a0 Case in point, Romeo Chocolates:  \n[https://imgur.com/a/CSmn0ox](https://imgur.com/a/CSmn0ox)  \nIn these times of woe, Chef Romeo prefers you place your orders online.\u00a0 For those orders, who helps process the payments? Google. Paypal. Shopify. Not Square.  \n4. How bad does it get?  \nVery bad. 50% of SQ's revenue comes from transaction payment processing (fees from Gross Payment Volume, or GPV); 45% of that comes from merchants who make less than 125k in payments volume through the platform and another 27% comes from merchants who make less than 500k in payments volume through the platform. Assuming half these smaller merchants are going to be doing minimal in-store business for the next 2 quarters, and most of these merchants will no longer use the SW services Square offers... you're looking at up to $350M of EBITDA impact, possibly more.\u00a0 Square's FY20E was \\~$500M, so this is a \\~80% impact.  \n5. Why is SQ up?  \n[https://imgur.com/a/DqRR2Rq](https://imgur.com/a/DqRR2Rq)  \nFor some reason, investors are confusing SQ's customer base with those of First Data/Fiserv, Elavon, Paypal, and Adyen.\u00a0 Those companies are not the same as Square.\u00a0 Their merchants are not hip.\u00a0 No, those merchants (ie Costco) are sell uncool but wildly profitable things like toilet paper and bottled water.\u00a0 In the COVIDian Maslow hierarchy, Costco beats sub-125k GPV merchants like Romeo Chocolates.\u00a0 And over 60% of Squares customers are small retailers and restaurants.\u00a0 Not exactly COVID proof.  \n6. When is the shoe going to drop?  \nMay 6th is when Square releases earnings.\u00a0 Investors will be looking for good vibes from the TrumpBuxx and JPOW SMB loans but all they will see - in the numbers - is a cavalcade of destruction.\u00a0 I for one will enjoy watching management defend TEV/Forward Ebitda at 75x when Forward EBITDA is projected to drop 80% this year.  \nThis is what Opentable says around half of Square's customer base has become:  \n[https://imgur.com/a/myJWpTx](https://imgur.com/a/myJWpTx)  \nDoes this look like something worth 11x revenue to you?",
