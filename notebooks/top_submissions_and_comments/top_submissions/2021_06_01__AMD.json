        "selftext": "Sup apes. Your favourite fruit is back for some sweet DD ($CRSR) that will catapult your shitty portfolio into the stratosphere. \n  \n\n\n  Ever heard of Corsair?\n-\nThey are the boys that fill your neat gaming PC full of dope parts. Not only are they a giant in this industry since their inception in 1994, they also got publicly listed last October for a measly **$15.**\n\n-\n\nNow, why should you care?\n-\n\nCorsair has all the properties that can make it THE stock of the decade for WSB - think AMD before they went from $4 to $80, now this time it's from $30 to $300.\n\n-\n\n**1.DeepF#ckingValue**\n-\n\nTheir current market cap stands at **3.12B** on **1.92B sales** and **148m profit.** That\u2019s insane in itself, their current market cap is minuscule and should be at least 5x their revenue. They are making cash hand over fist every quarter and are already a crazy growth rocket. \n\n\n \n\n-\nAs per recent earnings article: *\u201cMajor industry tailwinds seem to be helping Corsair achieve strong growth rates. In the first quarter, its overall revenue grew 72% year over year to $529 million. The company also continues to see improved profitability, as gross margin jumped from 25.5% a year ago to 30.3%.\u201d*\n\n\n-\n**2.Tiny float**\n-\n\nThey IPO\u2019d with only 91.95 million shares outstanding and a float of 88.4 million. This entire sub could outright buy the company out. Jokes aside, this isn't moving a 500m share giant like NOKIA, but rather like your beer filled kiddiepool.\n**3.Cheap Options**\n-\nFlat movement for the last months meaning LOW IV and CHEAP option prices. $40 Calls on November are $2. And long term leaps at $50 barely cost $1.40. Since inception last year, their shares went from $15 to $54 in the span of a couple months. This rally died off when people finally decided to take profits after the IPO. But if options are too rich for you, it's still an excellent time to buy shares and park your cash there while the run up to $50 happens.\n\n**4.Low Risk** \n-\nAlways arguable, but This company just IPOed, is healthy and makes tons of cash. No risk of bankruptcy looming around the corner, or shares being diluted if it his 50$ or 100$. YOU CAN SAFELY PARK YOUR YOLO'd CASH without the company blowing up any second.\n\n**What else?**\n\nAnalysts on SA have a big raging one for CRSR. (link in comments) and there is a very possible breakout about to happen + earnings coming up in August.\n\n\n\nNow what company fits better for millions of Gamestop apes? A Gaming company that will fill every GameStop with little ram sticks and gaming gear. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n\n\n**TL:DR** $CRSR is a good bet that could safely triple your money... Or blow your brains out with 3-6 months calls.\n\nObligatory: I LIKE THE STOCK. In for 5k and adding more this month.\n  \n[More notable DD from last week.](reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nsc45n/crsr_huge_volume_breakout_buy_wall_stalemate/)",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone, \n\nI believe that $AMD is on the verge of experiencing a catalyst that will push the stock to a new ATH. As many of us know $AMD has been trading sideways and down for the past year (with some noise) since last October. I feel fairly certain that that is about to change.\n\nLast October $AMD announced a merger with $XLNX. The two giant companies have been working it out since that time. Recently, both companies share holders overwhelmingly voted in favor of the merger. \n\nTo summarize what this merger means to $AMD we're talking about increased revenue, increased profit margin, better synergy and heading towards better products. The number 1 thing $AMD is going to get out of this? A better shot at taking down $INTC for the cloud market. A company with a market cap of roughly 225 billion compared to $AMD's 100 billion. So this is a David vs Goliath moment.\n\nThere's plenty of articles written out there on how this changes the financials and prospects for $AMD but I know you guys aren't going to read it if I re-write it here. To put it simply: This is a big deal. If you felt bad about missing $NVDA's stocksplit run, this is the potential chance of catching the 'next' big chip manf. movement.\n\nSo why am I writing this now instead of last October? Well, it's because things changed last week. We know who the customer is now: $GOOG.\n\nThat's right. A 1.67T company is taping $AMD over intel to help support their cloud.\n\nProof: [https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/17/why-amd-stock-rallied-on-thursday/?source=eptyholnk0000202&amp;utm\\_source=yahoo-host&amp;utm\\_medium=feed&amp;utm\\_campaign=article](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/17/why-amd-stock-rallied-on-thursday/?source=eptyholnk0000202&amp;utm_source=yahoo-host&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article)\n\nSo we know they picked up $XLNX. Now we know they are teeing up for $GOOG. This is freaking huge. Not to mention they also acquired business from $TSLA, another 600B+ company. \n\nProof: [https://fortune.com/2021/05/31/amd-tesla-contract-chips-infotainment-system-lisa-su/](https://fortune.com/2021/05/31/amd-tesla-contract-chips-infotainment-system-lisa-su/)\n\nSo, let's list them out...\n\nCatalysts:\n\n1. $XLNX Merger\n2. $TSLA contract\n3. $GOOG partnership\n\nThis is clearly a big picture strategy on $AMD's part to push $INTC's weakening cloud business straight into the grave and take it's spot. I believe if $AMD is succcessful they will eventually reach a valuation closer to 200-300 billion dollars within the next 1-2 years. That's a 200-300$ share price. \n\nSo what am I suggesting?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. I believe that post merger the fair value of $AMD is closer to 120-160 a share\n2. Without the merger $AMD has a value of about 120 a share                                                             \n(due to new contracts and overall market conditions. Just look at $NVDA's recent 50% run. Staying neck to neck as a competitor puts them at 120. But they have new business to justify it instead of black magic stock splits)\n\nIs there TA to support this? You bet there is. I use 2D time frames to wash out noise. I made some small crayon circles to give the picture some scope. You can use a 1W time frame and the analysis is the same. The stock's slow moving averages have begun to move higher and are approaching a cross, moving the stock towards positive. In simple terms: Gaining share value on average, every 2 days. And that rate is growing. The OBV is increasing meaning that **someone** 'aka Wall Street' is secretly scooping up shares and holding onto them. They are doing all of this while keeping the stock suppressed well below it's ATH. I believe they are intentionally gathering as much as they can before the catalysts combine and create a giant bull run. This is a long term run that could make a lot of people rich. The moment when $AMD sprints after $INTC and $NVDA. We all know as gamers and redditors that $AMD has become much much stronger and better in recent years. It's been amazing to watch their progress.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$AMD 2D time Frame](https://preview.redd.it/ueoex1s30q671.jpg?width=2448&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cae96daec77945f519f2c1a112456ec06399e2b3)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere on the 1 week you can see the faintest flicker of bullish life. This is due to the recent contract developments and the quickly approaching date of the merger. As I wrote above, **the catalyst is incoming**.\n\n[1 week time frame](https://preview.redd.it/9f80a7ur0q671.jpg?width=2440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31722579984b09e8fa30bcf913e22b2d41a96c5c)\n\nSo. When is the merger? I am sure you want some dates and some juicy possible plays. Here you go...\n\nWe've got 3 approvals that have to happen. \n\n1. EU - Believed to have no problems and will probably be approved end of June, end of July at the latest.\n2. UK - July 6th Deadline. Also rumored to have 0 problems\n3. CCP - This one there's no rumored date, but CCP supposedly has no issues as well.\n\nWhat is Wall Street doing? They are both shorting the stock while sweeping July calls as well as 2 year leaps. Take a look at July:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou've got 19498 calls purchased for July 16th at a 90$ strike. That sure sounds like Wall Street betting on it hitting 90$... after something happens. But we know what that is. It's the merger. \n\n[Unusual Option Chain July 16th](https://preview.redd.it/s3ez29jl2q671.jpg?width=942&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae8892e1f6a9a53eef3d2dc7a56f57c5a60926be)\n\nHow is this unusual? Take a look at the week prior:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[You could sum this up and it's barely even the volume for the 90$ strike on July 16th](https://preview.redd.it/53uatc9r2q671.jpg?width=944&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42bc7cd9650553fe2f3f34107f10c29c8a5e7ad6)\n\nSo how to interpret this? Well, I read this as Wall Street ***knowing*** what's about to happen. I believe they know the status of the merger, and approximately how far it's going to take the stock. I believe we're looking at $AMD pushing above 90$ by Mid July. This is a potential 10 bagger. Especially with them trying to push down $AMD's price today, now is a good opportunity to get in.\n\nSo what's the play? The easiest one is the 7/16/21 90$ strike. Go alongside wall Street and when you're happy with the profit--sell it. The merger could be announced any day so buying to at least that date is wise (IMO -- but I am just a degenerate not a financial expert). \n\nBuying longer could potentially let you capture more of the run if things play out the way I think it will. You could also take advantage of the current low to grab leaps and sit back and watch how this story unfolds over the next 2 years. Either way, there's real potential here in something most people are considering dead in the water.\n\nI am currently holding 119 contracts. A large portion are for the 7/16/21 90$. So yes, my money is on this play and continues to be what I pursue. This is my YOLO.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy recommendations: Buy shares, Buy calls for mid july. Buy leaps. If you buy shares wait for the catalyst to occur. When it reaches an apex, start selling $CCs because the IV is going to grow. \n\nAs a disclaimer, I am not a financial expert. I am just a retail stock trader. I love to do TA as a hobby. I truly believe that $AMD is being suppressed as Wall Street 'fattens' their positions. You know what I say? Fuck 'em. They think they are hiding what they are doing but I definitely see it. They are preparing and we can too. And, if we're right, we can make more than them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBest of luck out there. I hope you enjoyed my DD. I don't post DD often on WSB, but I hope y'all enjoyed the read. You guys are great and I love you all.",

        "selftext": "AMD's latest financial reports blew all estimates out of the water... and their latest guidance for 50% growth (up from 37%) is conservative. Here is why:\n\nFUNDAMENTALS: IT'S ALL ABOUT ENTERTAINMENT\n\nIn a post COVID-19 world, people will continue to flock towards entertainment.\n\nAs  confirmed by both TESLA and AMD recently, the latest Model X and S will  bring AMD silicon (GPU &amp; APU). This is HUGE, because this feature  will eventually trickle down as an optional to the Model 3 and rest of  the Tesla fleet. Why is this important? Just listen to Elon Musk drool  over PS5 performance on road trips with autonomous driving. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl\\_-bFNRJaw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_-bFNRJaw)\n\nBut that IS NOT ALL, as Valve will be launching a new portable handheld. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFn6LzUFTTA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFn6LzUFTTA)\n\nIn essence PS4, PS5, XBOX X &amp; S and Valve are all going FULL AMD.\n\nWho do you think Ford, GM, Chrysler, Mercedes, BMW, Audi, Volkswagen, Renault/Nissan will go with?\n\nENTERTAINMENT IS KEY and AMD is all over it.\n\nThis  is also HUGE as entertainment software will be tailored to AMD's  processing pipeline. Unreal Engine 5 is the perfect example, which  ALREADY performs better on a 6800XT than it does on a RTX3080 (up to 12%  better, as per Digital Foundry's performance benchmark - see screenshot  and video link below).\n\n[AMD 6800XT on left with 61fps - Nvidia RTX3080 on right with 56fps](https://preview.redd.it/eruzko9mwy471.jpg?width=1289&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fcbb478a1bcc940bd8c564b5d6b6ace551aa401)\n\n(digital foundry's benchmarks) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99VwDGyLg0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99VwDGyLg0)\n\nUnreal  Engine 5 (with Lumen) will make Nvidia Ray Tracing a thing of the past.  This software solution is much more efficient at managing illumination,  making it available for non-RTX hardware.\n\nIn  addition, enthusiasts are really pumped with AMD's latest presentation  at Computex, where they presented Fidelity FX SuperResolution. It aims  to provide up to 2x performance while super sampling images up to 4K.  And the kicker is that this solution will be available to ALL.\n\nIntel's  Raja Koduri (Head of Intel GPU, formerly an AMD employee) has already  confirmed they are looking into AMD's Fidelity FX SR (as per his twitter  post days ago): [https://twitter.com/Rajaontheedge/status/1399964541291622407?ref\\_src=twsrc%5Etfw](https://twitter.com/Rajaontheedge/status/1399964541291622407?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nSo yeah, AMD is the future of GAMING.\n\nBut on the stock analysis front, AMD has also begun its climb towards previous highs.\n\nIt has made a huge recovery since my latest post, when it was trading in the low $70's.\n\nJust imagine that AMD is trading at a Price/Earnings multiple of 34, with a market cap of $98.7B\n\nNvidia is trading at a P/E of 84 (over twice as much), with a market cap of $444B (over 4 times more).\n\nBut when you look at the financials, the differences shrink.\n\nOn Revenue, AMD has sales of $9.7B and net profits of $2.5B. Nvidia sold $16.6B for a net $4.3B.\n\nHow does that support Nvidia being over 4 times more expensive than AMD? It just doesn't.\n\nIf AMD were to trade at the same multiples: EPS of 2.38 \\* NVIDIA's P/E of 84.28 = $200 per share.\n\nAt $200 per share, AMD's market cap would be $243B... STLL HALF OF NVIDIA!!!! (WTF?!?!).\n\nThink about it, it is bound to close the distance towards $200 per share in the next 12 months.\n\nThe reasons are simple: Tesla, Valve, Unreal Engine 5, Ryzen 3D stacking and 50% growth for 2021.\n\nThe Xilinx deal WILL CLOSE in the next 6 months. THE BREAKOUT is IMMINENT!!!\n\nTo summarize, the product pipeline is AMAZING, not to mention the leaks on RDNA3 and Ryzen 4.\n\nThe new clientele is incredible: TESLA and Valve, added to Microsoft and Sony.\n\nJust imagine Xilinx FPGA accelerators integrated to AMD's Intellectual Property. Fuel the rockets!!!\n\nREMEMBER: In a matter of months you will be kicking yourself for ignoring this post!\n\nThe MOON is for amateurs.... WE'RE GOING TO MARS BABY!!!... with TESLA AND AMD!!!\n\nMARS - THE RED PLANET... WITH LISA AND ELON. PRIMATES AND APES TO COLONIZE IT IN 2022!!!\n\n..... ALL ABOARD!!!!",

        "selftext": "\n**Basics**\n\nAs long as you haven't been living under a fucking rock for the last decade, you know that AMD is a major player in electronic devices. While it has a minority hold in its markets, it still has a considerable market share AND has a hand in both GPUs and CPUs. It's versatile.\n\nWhile the silicon shortage is still big and doesn't show any signs of slowing, AMD is still most likely making a shitload of profit from the continuous buyouts of graphics cards for mining and the continuous selling of CPUs.\n\n**EPS/Financial history**\n\nAMD has been continuously crushing quarterly earnings targets for at least the past year, and shows no signs of slowing. It has consistently maintained a steady and rising profit.\n\n[Constantly winning](https://preview.redd.it/qz0qs58rh9571.png?width=332&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d615f35e833c3563f23d4de50afe3956f490d61b)\n\nOn top of this, the company has a total cash balance of 3.12 billion and a total debt of only 551 million, which is fucking great.\n\n[It's doing great with managing its debt and total cash to say the least](https://preview.redd.it/vh2sh5xai9571.png?width=422&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61451edd2ef36120f80b83aefbfbce123fe2813e)\n\nNot made up your mind yet? If not, I have even more great news for you! The company has been constantly underestimated/undervalued despite all these great numbers. The past 6 months have been shit which isn't to say it's been terrible in the long run which it definitely has not, but for a company that holds so much market in two major component categories at both the business and consumer level it's ridiculous for the stock to be consistently falling.\n\n[Constantly going down](https://preview.redd.it/j2pavto0j9571.png?width=434&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26816d6c905488484879bc98f527d8ac15accef9)\n\n**Shorts and shares**\n\nThe company is decently shorted with around 7% of the shares being shorted for a company with a solid background, which could be a disaster waiting to happen. Again, it's not heavily shorted by any means but I don't think 7% is something to scoff at.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zk34ou1sl9571.png?width=427&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6215e701d1970588345fb0c063ae217516419a0c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Memeablility**\n\nNow that we've gone over all the boring numbers, let's talk about the memability of the company. It's a fucking computer parts company. Computers=gaming, gaming=memes. It's simple logic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**More general points**\n\nAMD has a solid community reputation, and while the performance its components put out is not on par with that of nvidia and intel, the products are generally more user/consumer friendly and cheaper, plus not everyone is looking to buy an RTX 6090 with liquid shit cooling built in for the unaffordable price of a kidney. AMD is geared more towards the average consumer which makes up a large portion of the computer market. Not only this but AMD chips are appearing more and more in laptops and pre-built computers. Another small point is that Microsoft is using AMD chips in their new generation of Xbox.\n\nAgain, all of this is speculation and I'm not telling anyone what decision to make, this is just my take on it.",

        "selftext": "I have only posted twice on this subreddit so I\u2019m still learning to make DD posts.\n\nI have been an Intel bull for a while, I have built computers and studied computer tech since I was in middle school so I understand Intel and it\u2019s products.\n\nIntel\u2019s share price has had a bumpy ride over the past couple years, mostly trading sideways, and giving up gains very soon after achieving them. Intel as a business has had very poor management as intel for a long time has essentially been complacent in its innovation because of lack of competition. Intel only 5 years ago was far ahead of where AMD was (AMD being its most well recognized competitor) this has changed now that AMD has been able to outsource its chip manufacturing to TSMC, which is a Taiwan semiconductor company that produces the smallest chip and most dense chip designs that are available. This partnership has allowed AMD to eat away and Intel\u2019s market share over the past 2-3 years, but there are many overlooked reasons for why Intel should still be considered a boof value buy.\n\nIntel is it\u2019s own manufacturer. Intel is not like AMD as intel has its own fab factories meaning they don\u2019t have to outsource there products to other companies. This will be huge for intel as the chip trade war heats up, Intel will likely receive large subsidies from the US government as Intel is the only Us based chip manufacturing company.\n\nIntel is expanding into new markets.\nIntel has as of this year expanded into graphics processing. A market that was completely dominated by Nvidia for decades. This is a very good and logical expansion of intel\u2019s market. Intel is also partnering with other companies to try to create new processing technologies. Intel has also announced all new fab factories that will be completed by 2023.\n\nIntel has had a refocus and has gotten new leadership. Intel has a new ceo (Patrick Gelsinger) Gelsinger has done a fantastic job refocusing the company on innovation, and if AMD is any example of how changing leadership can rejuvenate a company, then this should be great for intel\u2019s projected growth, as AMD\u2019s ceo (Lisa Su) has saved AMD since she has started working as there chief executive.\n\nIntel is in a exponentially growing market. The chip industry is a very high growth sector. This has helped intel as its lack of innovation has been offset by its sale performance the past few years. Investors just need reason to believe intel will grow with its completion in order to feel confident in the company as an investment.\n\nMy last point is that Intel is fundamentally undervalued. The other chip companies in the industry have average P/E ratios around 35~40 intel, however, has a P/E ratio of 12. This ties into my previous point that investors just need reason to believe in intel\u2019s long term growth, and once they have it intel will likely skyrocket. Intel also has the greatest market cap out of its competitors and has the lowest price to book value and not to mention billions in free cash flow. Intel is also a high dividend stock with a dividend of 2.48. while AMD and TSMC offer no dividends.\n\nI will edit this post as I find more information that I didn\u2019t cover.\n\nThank you for reading! And all criticism is welcomed!",

        "selftext": "I am halfway through an 18 hour shift, currently stationed in Turkey, its hot as fuck, idk why I\u2019m here, I\u2019m 2,000mg deep in caffeine, getting drunk as soon as I get off, getting off as soon as I get off, my wife is back home cheating, my daughter calls another man dad, *cracks knuckles* lets do this. \n\nOverview\n\n\tAMD is a global semiconductor company offering x86 microprocessors as standalone or integrated (CPU\u2019s, GPU\u2019s, server systems, Etc\u2026) and intellectual property/ services.\n\nProducts\n\n\tAMD\u2019s primary products consist of CPU\u2019s and GPU\u2019s which are on par or out performing NVIDIA GPU\u2019s and Intel\u2019s CPU\u2019s. While these other two giants have dominated the market for sometime, AMD\u2019s recent move has evolved from a slow creep to a brisk jog. \n\nCompetition \n\n\tAMD\u2019s largest competitors are Intel (CPU\u2019s) and NVIDIA (GPU\u2019s). With the release of AMD\u2019s Ryzen processors in 2017, AMD has been steadily over taking Intel\u2019s dominance over market share. AMD\u2019s current market share (over all CPU\u2019s) currently sits at 44%, levels it has not seen since 2005. AMD took 20% of the market share in past 2 years with a significant jump in 2019. Since the release of Ryzen, AMD is now on par or out performing Intel chips and has gained a significant amount of sentiment over the soy boys at intel. AMD is on track to overtake the majority of CPU market share within the next year based on current projections.\n\n\tNow NVIDIA is a whole other beast who currently has a significant advantage over the dGPU market. Nvidia at the end of Q4 2020, held roughly 82% of the market share which was a increase of 9% from the previous year. AMD\u2019s high end GPU\u2019s do not come close to Nvidia\u2019s high end models, UNTIL AMD\u2019s Radeon 6000 series, which are now on par with Nvidia\u2019s cards, either outperforming or underperforming in various tests. AMD catching up to Nvidia is the same move that AMD made against Intel in 2017, 4 years later they are on the verge of overtaking market share. While Nvidia is a monster of a company, I believe that AMD will begin taking more market share from Nvidia and establish a decent foothold over the next few years. AMD has already taken the game console market, console plebs.\n\n\tAMD has already proved they are able to take back significant market share with there current and future products, Lisa Su is a genius and I believe she\u2019ll lead the company to Valhalla. What does AMD have that Nvidia does not? Aside from many differences, I think the fact that AMD has an ecosystem will play a significant role in catching up. Now that AMD can evenly compete with both of their rivals, AMD plans on leveraging the fact that they produce CPU\u2019s and GPU\u2019s. There are already incentives to using AMD\u2019s CPU with their GPU rather than an AMD CPU with a Nvidia GPU. With AMD taking the CPU market, retail users will be more likely to stick with the ecosystem, and I\u2019m a big fan of companies producing an ecosystem (laughs in apple). \n\n\tA new player enters the battle. Intel has been working on their own dGPU and will surely be releasing in the next few years, but I believe this will be comparable to Sony vs Microsoft with Nintendo enjoying their best life staring at butterfly\u2019s, covered in drool in the corner lol.\n\nThe Merger\n\n\tNvidia set to acquire ARM, AMD set to acquire Xilinx. What are they and how are they expected to impact the company?\n\nARM - Create and dominate the mobile processor market, covering TV\u2019s, phones, tablets, and other similar products as well as some software applications. I will not be covering much more of ARM in this DD.\n\nXilinx - Designs and develops programmable logic products. As far as I can tell this is some big brain shit that I\u2019m sure some booger nosed, mothers basement living, neck beard having, nerd will easily explain in the comments cuz Wikipedia ain\u2019t cutting it.  \n\n\tIf AMD completes the purchase, which is likely and expected to happen by the end of 2021, Xilinx shares will become worth 1.723 shares of AMD. AMD is currently trading at 86.10$, meaning that shares of Xilinx will be worth 148.35$ if the deal were to go through right now. Xilinx is currently worth 133.71$, I\u2019m betting heavily that AMD will continue to pump prior to this deal as well.\n\n\tARM will be huge for Nvidia, but this is running into some major road blocks and is likely some ways off or will fall through.\n\nFinancials and projections (I had pictures but I\u2019m reddit dumb)\n\nNet Revenue\n$9.8B(2020), $6.7B(2019), $6.5B(2018), $5.2B(2017)\nNet Incum \n$2.5B(2020), $341M(2019), $337M(2018), $(33)M(2017)\n\t\n\tI like your growth G\n\n\tAMD decreased their debt to 338 million from 568 million.\n\t\n\t$1.6 billion in cash ($9 billion in total assets, I find cash on hand more important)\n\n\tGPU/CPU sales accounted for $6.5 billion while enterprise accounted for $3.3 billion, GPU/CPU sales saw a 37% increase over 2019 while enterprise saw a 65% increase in 2020. 2021 is set to continue this trend of growth.\n\n\tAMD has a high price target of $169.70, median $107.00, and an average of $103.92. I just read 100\u2019s of pages of 8k\u2019s and 10\u2019ks, plus I\u2019m super attracted to the ole doc Su Bae so I\u2019m betting that it will get a target price upgrade, regardless $103 will make me rich. There is a lot more we could dive into on financials but idk what the fuck I\u2019m doing so nah.\n\nRisks\n\n\tI like to plan for more than 1 risk occurring at a time so keep that in mind. Ive highlighted the risks that I find most impactful/ probable. Also keep in mind of global shortages for damn near every company, especially with chips.\n\n\t- Intel/ Nvidia\u2019s market share dominance (mostly Nvidia)\n\t- Seasonal sales can make for shit earnings in Q1/Q2\n\t- Reliance on third parties for manufacturing/ distributors\n\t- Xilinx deal falls through\n\t- Jim Cramer also likes this stock\n\n\tThat\u2019s enough risks, what am I, a gay bear?\n\nTLDR\n\nAMD will moon, Lisa Su is my mommy and is cooking up some tendies, AMD GPU\u2019s are now in Teslas,  obligatory rockets (insert rocket emojis here), lots of words just buy it.\n\nPOS\n150 shares @ 78.50\nJan22 $100/$105C\nLooking for entry into Xilinx cuz I dumb",

        "selftext": "# Call Options:\n\n&gt;**This post is intended for beginners that don't know the basics yet. I have simplified things and covered the only basic ideas.**\n\nA **call option (or just \u201ccall\u201d)** is a contract that gives you the **opportunity**, **not obligation**, to buy **100 shares** of a stock, bond, commodity or other financial asset at a specific price (**strike price**) by a specific date (**expiration date**). The financial asset in question is the **underlying asset**, you profit when the underlying asset\u2019s price increases.\n\n**Example**:  You buy a $100 call option for AMD that expires on July 10th. With this  call option, you have the right to buy 100 shares of AMD at $100 per  share before end-of-day on July 10th. If the price increases to $120  before your expiration date, you can still buy the contract at your  original $100 per share price.\n\n# Premiums:\n\nThe premium the money you need to pay the seller of the option in **exchange for the contract**, obviously they need to make money too. A premium **increases** your **breakeven** price, as it is an additional cost.\n\n**Example**:  Your $100 AMD call has a $3 premium. This means, that for each of the  100 shares in the contract, you owe $3 to the seller. $3 x 100 = $300.  In exchange for this premium, the seller gives you the call option.  Therefore, in order to breakeven, you now need $103 share price for AMD  because if it were to only go up to $100, you\u2019d still be out of pocket  due to the $300 premium paid. If the stock price goes to $104, you have  made a profit, as it is higher than your $103 cost per share.\n\nIf the AMD share price **dips** lower than your $100 contract (known as **Out of the Money or OTM**), **you do not have to buy the 100 shares**. Call options give you the **right, not obligation**  to purchase the shares, at most you will lose the premium paid, but you  won\u2019t have to buy the 100 shares. On the other hand, if the share price  **increases** (known as **In the Money or ITM**), and you cannot afford to buy the 100 shares you can then **sell your contract to someone else**. **Contracts can be sold prior to your expiration date.**\n\n&gt;This is how you\u2019ll see people write their position: **AMD $100c 7/10**  \nThis translates to an AMD **call** option, with a **strike price of $100** and an e**xpiration date of July 10th.**\n\n# Covered Call Options:\n\nA  covered call is when you own an underlying asset and at the same time  write (sell) a call option. The idea is that you don\u2019t mind holding an  underlying asset long term and that you believe it\u2019s price will remain  stable over time. So, you write (sell) call options hoping they expire  worthless (below strike price) meaning you keep the shares of your  underlying asset while collecting the premium paid by the buyer. The  options writer\u2019s profit on covered calls is the premium paid by the  buyer.",

        "selftext": "To start off I do have a position in NVIDIA but nonetheless the reason for this DD is strictly information not persuasive. I truly believe NVIDIA is *undervalued* currently. ***I believe NVDIA will reach 800 pre-split (200 post 4-1 split) with the current momentum going for the stock along with a shift to tech soon.***\n\n\u00a0If you didn't know already, NVIDIA designs graphics processing units for the gaming and professional markets, as well as system on a chip units for the mobile computing and automotive market.\u00a0\n\n*EARNINGS*\u00a0\n\n**NVIDIA recently had its earnings report in which they reported $3.66 earnings per share for the quarter, beating the consensus estimate of $3.28 by $0.38.** They recorded revenue of $5.66 billion, up 84 percent from a year earlier and up 13 percent from the previous quarter, with record revenue from the company\u2019s Gaming, Data Center and Professional Visualization platforms. Gaming revenue of $2.76 billion, up 106 percent from a year earlier. Record Data Center revenue of $2.05 billion, up 79 percent from a year earlier.\u00a0\n\n## Quarterly Earnings Surprise Amount\n\n**Fiscal Quarter End| Date Reported | Earnings Per Share\\*| Consensus EPS\\* Forecast | % Surprise**\n\n**Apr 2021.                    05/26/2021                  3.13                                     2.62**                                **19.47%**\n\n**Jan 2021                      02/24/2021                  2.58                                      2.2                                  17.27%**\n\n**Oct 2020                     11/18/2020                   2.41                                     1.92                                25.52%**\n\n**Jul 2020                       08/19/2020                  1.67                                     1.63                                 2.45%**\n\nAs you can see over the past four quarterly earnings NVDIA has beaten each of the projected forecasts easily for the most part. With a gross margin of 64.11% for this quarter, and an average quarterly gross margin of 60.96% over the past 5 years, NVDIA is primed to continue its dominance for the future. Also it is important to note that **NVDIA beats out its main competitors Intel and AMD in gross margins on average over the past 5 years and over the last quarter.**\u00a0\n\n## NVDIA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Range, Past 5 Years\n\n**Minimum 54.74% Jan 2019**\n\n**Maximum 65.06% Apr 2020**\n\n**Average 60.96%**\n\n## AMD Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Range, Past 5 Years\n\n**Minimum 4.51% Sep 2016**\n\n**Maximum 46.07% Mar 2021**\n\n**Average 37.34%**\n\n## Intel Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Range, Past 5 Years\n\n**Minimum 53.13% Sep 2020**\n\n**Maximum 64.50% Sep 2018**\n\n**Average 59.65%**\n\nNow onto reasons why I think NVIDIA is a strong buy.\u00a0\n\n1. **Price targets**\n\nNVDIA is still undervalued with multiple price targets very much higher than the current price of what NVDIA is trading at currently along with multiple buy ratings. One example in specific, **Bank of America recently upgraded NVDIA price target to $900 from $800 and reiterated its Buy rating.** The bank said its takeaway is that \"rising AI adoption, expanding use-cases across cloud, enterprise, edge, telco can help NVDA double its content and triple its data center sales over the next few years.\" Bank of America said it expects NVIDIA's data center business to grow at a 35% compounded rate to become its largest segment by year-end 2025. Other notable price targets include 854- Jefferies, 800- Robert W Baird, 800- Rosenblatt Securities.\u00a0\n\n1. **Acquisition of ARM**\n\n\u00a0ARM can\u2019t stay independent for long, even the CEO thinks so. Arm CEO Simon Segars\u00a0made the case that if it stays independent, Arm wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up with the increasing demands of its customers for more complex chips that can perform a wider variety of functions. The simple solution? Getting acquired by another company. NVIDIA seems to be in the lead to acquire ARM and other rivals are terrified. They have a good reason to be, as NVDIA already a strong leader wants to spend $40 billion to acquire U.K. chip technology provider Arm Holdings. This acquisition will reshape the industry entirely. NVIDIA CEO, Jensen Huang said the acquisition of ARM is an opportunity to create a company that can generate even more new ideas, and bring more innovation to its customers in the form of intellectual property. A quote in specific, \u201cThe benefit to the market, and to the Arm customers will be more IP, better IP, more accelerated road maps and hopefully taking Arm to the far reaches of what is becoming \u2026the diversity of computing that is literally going in every single direction,\u201d Huang said. \u201cYou\u2019re covering everything from cloud, to edge, to \\[internet of things\\], to high performance computing, to microprocessors, to accelerated computing\u2014everything.\u201d\n\n2. **Internet currency ( Not allowed to say actual word so replaced it with internet)**\n\nGPU\u2019s can be used for internet currency and its mining purposes. It\u2019s possible to blame the graphic card shortage on these miners but nonetheless, the usage of them is highly prevalent today. NVIDIA's releases of processors specifically used for mining poses a huge boost to its revenue and to the internet currency world. **NVIDIA booked $155 million in revenue from CMP cards in its fiscal first quarter.** While internet money is gaining traction around the world, we can expect NVIDIA to continue its dominance and reliability in mining purposes.\u00a0\n\n3. **Stock split**\u00a0\n\nOn May 21st, NVIDIA announced a 4-1 stock split which would take place on July 19th. So for every one share you own, you will own four instead as the stock splits its price valuation by four. On the day of the news, NVIDIA\u2019s stock price closed at $599.67. **Since then, the price of NVIDIA\u2019s stock has gone up around 24% to $743.75**. Not even one month has passed and the stock is up 24%! With one full month until the split **I predict NVDIA to hit $800 or/and above by the time of the official split**. Call options and shares in my opinion are the way to go for the next month as this could be a great opportunity to invest in a fast growth company.\u00a0\n\n4. **Growth**\u00a0\n\nNVIDIA has been a great growth tech stock to own recently with the numbers backing this statement up.\u00a0\n\n**NVIDIA RETURNS**\u00a0\n\nYTD: +223.35 (+42.77%)\n\n1 Year: +376.83 (+102.20%)\n\n6 Months: +214.67 (+40.44%)\n\n1 Month: +184.92 (+32.98%)\n\nNow for the returns on NVIDIA compared to AMD and INTEL.\u00a0\n\n**NVIDIA RETURNS**\u00a0\n\nYTD: +223.35 (+42.77%)\n\n1 Year: +376.83 (+102.20%)\n\n6 Months: +214.67 (+40.44%)\n\n1 Month: +184.92 (+32.98%)\n\n**AMD RETURNS**\n\nYTD: -7.06 (-7.70%)\n\n1 Year: +30.61 (+56.64%)\n\n6 Months: -11.27 (-11.75%)\n\n1 Month: +10.21 (+13.72%)\n\n**INTEL RETURNS**\n\nYTD: +5.85\u00a0 (+11.74%)\n\n1 Year: -4.41 (-7.34%)\n\n6 Months: +8.21 (+17.30%)\u00a0\n\n1 Month: +0.83 (+1.51%)\n\n**NVIDIA beats Intel and AMD in every single category growth wise showing complete dominance with its stock price.**\u00a0\n\nConcluding I believe NVIDIA is a must buy presplit and the risk is minimum. The stock shows solid uptrend with extreme growth to come. NVIDIA is a strong buy in my personal opinion and an amazing company to be invested in.\u00a0",

        "selftext": "AMD is up 3% this morning because of this deal. Does this allow the stock to retrace all time highs or are chip shortages and a high multiple still a concern?  I own $90 LEAPS for next year and while they are currently in the red, I'm still bullish on the company.\n\n&gt;June 17 (Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google Cloud on Thursday said Google will offer cloud computing services based on AMD's newest data center chip, a move likely to intensify AMD's push to grab market share from rival Intel Corp (INTC.O).\n\n&gt;Cloud computing providers such as Google, Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) are some of the biggest buyers of data center chips.

        "selftext": "So I\u2019ve been following AMD since it was a $30 little boy share, and I\u2019ve always believed in it long. Looking at its history, you can see the annual returns over the last five years have been great. But here\u2019s why this particular autist really likes this stock. But first, a bit of backstory about AMD.\n\n###Who is AMD and why do we care?\n\n**Advanced Micro Devices** (AMD) is a computer hardware development and manufacturing company at its core. They design and sell Processors, GPUs, APUs, and the like. For anyone who has been into gaming or building PCs, you\u2019d probably recognize AMD as the \u201cbudget build\u201d: the company who\u2019s processors you buy when you don\u2019t want to shell out $900 for a top shelf Intel. They have always been seen as an underdog in Intel\u2019s shadow, with Intel having the superior clock speeds, Hyperthreading tech, and better clout when it comes to contracting.\n\n###Next Gen Consoles\n\nCurrently the latest gaming consoles are the PS5 and the Xbox Series X, both being relatively impossible to get your hands on due to the microchip shortage (more on that later). *AMD powers both.*\n\nLet that sink in. AMD has no competition for this generation of video game consoles. Every PS5 and Xbox X that gets built, AMD gets a chunk of that change. This is basically guaranteed profit for the life of the console, historically that\u2019s about 6-7 more years.\n\n###Server Hardware\n\nAMD has been expanding their server hardware lineup, and their biggest competitor Intel has dropped the ball on this one: their new server hardware isn\u2019t rolling out til Q1 2022. Meanwhile, Google is replacing outdated hardware with AMD processors. This is a big step for AMD, because it puts them in the position of no longer being the underdog, and gives them juicy, profitable market share.\n\n###CEO Lisa Su\n\nLisa Su is an awesome woman. She has a diverse background including Texas Instruments and IBM, and since she took the reigns of AMD in 2014, the stock has soared. She helped diversify their product line success, and saw the immense benefit of getting AMD server chips licensed in China.\n\n###The future of work\n\nLots of people see the future of work moving towards a larger working from home model (anecdotal). Working from home requires hardware, and people buying hardware prefer to spend less if they can, and this is the hardware AMD specializes in.\n\n###Semiconductor Shortage\n\nThe massive demand for semiconductors for everything from cars to laptops to servers has been a drag on literally the entire economy. Auto manufactory lines in Midwest America are at a standstill while car lots are barren of new vehicles because of the world\u2019s \u201cjust in time\u201d production model collapsing under increased demand.\n\nI personally believe this shortage is artificially holding down the price of AMD, as big money is slower to invest in a company that could potentially suffer from the shortage. Once things pick back up, there is a lot of potential for accelerated movement upwards as things become available to the public for purchase.\n\nAMD is a preferred client of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), which has invested billions into additional manufacturing capacity.\n\n###Get on the train before it leaves!\n\nOnce these processors start shipping out, the profits will roll in and sentiment will return. Boarding this rocket begins now! \ud83e\udd8d \ud83d\ude80 \ud83c\udf1d \n\nI hold 100 shares @84 average and some 12/17/21 $155 calls.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m profoundly autistic, my late wife\u2019s second boyfriend told me so. This is not financial advice, I am retarded.",

        "selftext": " \n\n**Why Intel ($INTC) is undervalued**\n\nThis is my first ever stock analysis, any tips will be appreciated. \n\nDISCLOSURE: I do not own any shares of Intel at the time of writing. \n\nIntel is a chipmaker who has been beaten down by the ongoing global chip shortage. Intel is down from it\u2019s high and has a relatively low P/E value. I am currently bullish on Intel. AMD is currently expensive and overvalued at the moment. AMD has had no availability in the consumer market for quite some time. Intel is finally the more affordable option again (in terms of consumer parts) due to AMD having very limited availability. In terms of stock, Intel is currently down from it\u2019s high and has potential to go back up. \n\n**Finances**\n\nFirst things first, let\u2019s get into Intel\u2019s financials. Over the past few years, Intel has had steady revenue growth:\n\n2017: 62.76B\n\n2018: 70.85B\n\n2019: 71.97B\n\n2020: 77.87B\n\nIntel has also been steadily buying back outstanding shares, declining in numbers every year:\n\nIn 2018, Intel had 4.701B outstanding shares, a 2.77% decrease from 2017.\n\nIn 2019, Intel had 4.473B outstanding shares, a 4.85% decrease from 2018.\n\nIn 2020, Intel had 4.232B outstanding shares, a 5.39% decrease from 2019.\n\nIn March 2021, Intel had 4.096B outstanding shares, a 5.01% decrease from 2020.\n\n**Competition/Growth Potential**\n\nIntel has a P/E ratio of 12.80. This is low, compared to the average P/E ratio of 22.69 for the rest of the industry. Intel is also still down from it\u2019s stock price high of \\~$68 in April at \\~$57 right now. The global chip shortage has been the main cause of Intel being down, along with fierce competition from AMD. As chip production begins to pick back up, Intel\u2019s stock should begin to go up as well. AMD has been hurt greatly from this chip shortage as well, giving Intel a chance to possibly undercut AMD and lead to growth. \n\nIntel also plans to build more production plants so that they can keep up with the ever-increasing demand for chips. Intel is still ahead of AMD in market share as well. Intel\u2019s new 11th Gen processors are back on top in terms of speed, especially in laptops. A subsidiary of Intel has also landed a deal with Toyota ($TM) to produce radar technology for Toyota. \n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nIntel seems to be using the chip shortage as a way to come back from their drought. They seem to have been benefiting from it greatly.\n\nIntel is not out yet. They still have the market share and resources to compete with AMD. Intel is undervalued and has the capability to bounce back strong from the chip shortage and also has a chance to finally come out on top as the primary choice in the chip market. \n\nWhat are everyone else\u2019s thoughts? I personally believe that Intel is due for a breakout in the next months, but what does everyone else think? I was also wondering about Qualcomm ($QCOM), what does everyone think about that?",

        "selftext": "# Put Options 101\n\n**Put Options:**\n\nContinuing from my previous [**Call Options 101**](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/npvykp/call_options_101/) post, here are the very **basics** to understanding what put options are and how they work!\n\nA **put option (or just \u201cput\u201d)** is a contract that gives you the **right, not obligation**, to **sell 100 shares** of a stock, bond, commodity or other financial asset at a specific price (strike price) by a specific date (expiration date). The financial asset in question is the underlying asset, you profit when the underlying asset\u2019s price decreases.\n\n* If you think the price of an underlying asset will decrease, you can buy a put option.\n* If you think the price of an underlying asset will increase, you can write (sell) a put option.\n\n# Buying vs Selling:\n\n**Buying a Put Option:**\n\nIf the price of the underlying asset falls below the strike price the put option is **In the Money (ITM).** ITM put options have an intrinsic value because the current price of the underlying asset is lower than the strike price.\n\nIf the price of the underlying asset hits the strike price or goes beyond it, then the put option is **Out of the Money** (OTM), therefore expiring worthless and allowing the writer (seller) to collect their premium.\n\n**Example:** You buy a $100 put option on AMD with a $2 premium that expires on July 10th. Every dollar decrease below the strike price earns you $100 profit, since each contract is made up of 100 shares. Your breakeven point (the point at which your put option becomes profitable) is $98 (strike *minus* premium). If the underlying asset price increases above $100 by your expiration date, your put option expires worthless and your maximum loss is $200 ($2 premium x 100 shares).\n\n# Selling a Put Option:\n\nThe writer (seller) of a put option has the obligation to buy the underlying asset at the strike price. In order to do this, you\u2019d need enough cash in your account or margin capacity to cover the purchase.\n\n* If the price of the underlying asset decreases below the strike price by expiration date, the writer (seller) must purchase the underlying stock at the strike price.\n* If the price of the underlying asset increases above the strike price the writer (seller) profits by collecting the premium paid by the buyer.\n\n**Example:** You write (sell) a $100 put option on AMD with a $2 premium that expires on July 10th. Every dollar decrease below the strike price increases the writer (seller) cost by $100. The breakeven point (the point at which your put option becomes profitable) is $98 (strike *minus* premium). The maximum profit for the put writer (seller) is the $200 premium ($2 premium x 100 shares).\n\nOn the other hand, if the buyer exercises the put option, then the writer (seller) must by the 100 shares at the strike price, which depending on the price of the underlying asset could result in a potential loss larger then the value of the underlying asset.\n\n# Buying a Call vs Selling a Put?\n\n**While they are both bullish positions, they are quite different:**\n\n1. When  you buy a call, you have the right, not the obligation to purchase the  underlying asset at the strike price upon expiry, this gives the call  buyer control. When selling a put, the writer (seller) has the  obligation to buy the underlying asset at the strike price if the buyer  ends up exercising prior to expiry.\n2. When  buying a call, the potential loss is limited to the premium paid while  the profit is theoretically unlimited depending on the price fluctuation  of the underlying asset. It is the opposite when selling puts, your  profit is capped at the premium paid by the buyer, but your potential  loss is theoretically unlimited depending on how the price decrease of  the underlying asset.\n3. Buying  a call does not require you cash or margin capacity. Selling a put  requires you to have enough cash or margin capacity in your account.\n\n# Put Strategies:\n\n**Buying Put Options:**\n\nIf you're bearish on an underlying asset, you can purchase put options, essentially shorting the underlying to profit from the price decrease.\n\n**Selling Put Options:**\n\nIf you're bullish on a underlying asset, you can write (sell) put options with the hopes that they expire worthless and that you profit by collecting your premium.\n\n**Protective Puts:**\n\nA protective put is basically an insurance policy that limits any potential losses from price drops of an underlying asset. \n\n**Example:** You own 100 shares of AMD, the current price per share is $100. You're bullish, expecting the price to increase in the future but you'd like to protect yourself against any unexpected price dips. You do this by purchasing a protective put contract with a strike price of $100 with a $10 premium.\n\n1. **If the share price increases** from $100 to $110, you are profitable on your position and your protective put will expire worthless. Current Price - (Strike Price + Premium) = Profit.\n2. **If the share price is between** $100 and $110, you will either breakeven or experience a loss due to the premium paid for the protective put.\n3. **If the share price dips below** $100 you can exercise your protective put to limit your losses. Once you have exercised your put, you can sell your 100 shares at the $100 strike price, limiting your loss to the premium paid for the put contract.\n\n**Naked Puts:**\n\nA naked put (uncovered or short) involves writing (selling) a put option without having a short position in the underlying asset, therefore making it uncovered. The potential profit is limited to the premium paid by the buyer, the potential loss is theoretically unlimited as if the price of the underlying asset dips to 0 you'll be obligated to purchase the stock at the strike price which could mean a very significant loss.\n\n**Put Spreads:**\n\nA put spread strategy is when multiple contracts are bought/sold at the same time on an underlying asset with different strike prices or expiration dates. This is done to cover multiple price fluctuation scenarios, it limits the potential loss while also limiting the potential profit.",

        "selftext": "Ok so we all know the many reasons AMD is going to go absolutely nuts once the $XLNX merger gets through regulatory approval. For those of you who are in the stock or considering a position I want to point out something I haven\u2019t heard discussed.\n\nAfter finally hiring a CEO Pat Gelsinger\u2019s BIG announcement was that Intel would re-enter the fab business. At a glance it may seem like so what? Well the reason Pat is focusing investor and media attention on their fab business is he knows they have lost and will not regain competitive advantage over AMD anytime soon. He has to set the stage for investors to buy Intel for the future potential in Fab because he knows soon they will drop the stock like hot garbage as AMD takes away not some but the majority of the high end computing revenue.\n\nI personally believe between Data Center, GPU, Notebook, Desktop, Consoles, Cell Phone, Automotive and 5G $AMD will be $300-$400 in the next few years. Buy leaps or shares and enjoy the ride.\n\nNot financial advice.",

        "selftext": "# DEAR APES,\n\nA few weeks ago I began posting on AMD. At the time, the stock was trading in the mid-70's.\n\nToday, as expected, we crossed $90 price... but our trip is just getting **STARTED**!\n\nThe deal with TESLA was announced, as well as the next AMAZING technologies in Computex, including the stacked cache for Zen3, Fidelity FX Super Resolution, the 6900 XTX Liquid Cooled, etc.\n\nThere's a very simple reason why AMD will go past the MOON and MARS: **ENTERTAINMENT**\n\nThe world revolves around entertainment and in this new era, this activity is mandatory to deal with Covid-19, the lack of international travel, work from home, etc.\n\nTESLA adopting AMD for its new Model X and S is HUGE. It will take a Navi23 and an APU (two chips) per car, likely becoming an optional for all other vehicles in the future. More automobile brands will follow, as TESLA is leading the way in the industry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[TESLA selected AMD chips for its upcoming vehicles](https://preview.redd.it/aekg7gm3u8871.jpg?width=2243&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c178f47df42b4159f92d1248ac9618a3f8440643)\n\nWith autonomous driving, gaming in a long trip will be mandatory. But even without it, the rest of the passengers can game, either with their fellow companions or online, from their car.\n\nSo, yes, the current automotive revolution will have AMD as a main supplier.\n\nThen you have consumer processing, which includes CPU's and GPU's, where AMD is dominating (mostly on the former). The Zen3 architecture is a MONSTER. Intel just cannot compete. And with the stacked cache providing up to 15% more gaming performance, that lead will continue on AMD's side.\n\nOn GPU's, AMD's Navi31 is expected to be MCM (multi-chip module), aiming to repeat AMD's success with Intel, but now against NVIDIA. \"Chiplets\" allow for economies of scale to thrive. More silicon, will less defects, better binning, cheaper... it is an AMAZING IDEA. Just add cache and the latency problem can be mitigated.\n\nOn the console gaming, AMD is the undisputed KING. They're in the PS4, PS4 Pro, PS5, Xbox model and series X/S. Also in the Aya Neo and expected in Valve's next handheld, which will be a MONSTER.\n\nOn Datacenter, AMD is groundbreaking. Epyc and the new offerings from **GOOGLE** for virtual machines is an INCREDIBLE deal. **AMAZON, TENCENT, ALIBABA, AZURE** (Microsoft), they are all buying chips from AMD. More CORES means MORE power processing, lower energy, lower licensing costs and certainly better SECURITY (as INTEL has been plagued by Spectre &amp; Meltdown issues). AMD is now expected to go from 64 cores in EPYC to 96... and also 128. That's just ludicrous, 128 CORES and 256 threads. And X86 clients are THRILLED to buy more power in a more efficient chip.\n\n[Google wants AMD Milan Epyc Chips for its Datacenter](https://preview.redd.it/36x8ygt6u8871.jpg?width=2284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d96e3eab884218203d9fbe906b9ba3474902e13)\n\nDeals with the US Department of Energy (El Capitan), Singapore and Germany, all for public datacenters worth millions of dollars. That's just the tip of the iceberg, as private players are taking note of EPYC.\n\nLast, **but certainly NOT least: MOBILE**\n\nAMD will power Samsung's S22 flagship phone. It's GPU is expected to break records, as engineering samples already have it beating MALI and Apple's options, by **double digits**.\n\n**Samsung** is delighted and **Google** also wants AMD chips for its phones.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Samsung wants AMD's chips for its flagship GALAXY S22](https://preview.redd.it/xu07hgobu8871.jpg?width=1919&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfea79ba818835fb83a9cb5f51d5189cf2d034e0)\n\nBut enough on the PRODUCTS. What about the fundamentals?\n\nRevenue growth is expected at 50% by the end of 2021. How many companies are growing by 50%?\n\nAnd that guidance was provided with the Q1 results in April, which were exceeding expectations. The raised the guidance from 37% to 50%... and will certainly BEAT IT.\n\nAMD is NOW a profitable company... and it literally CANNOT keep its products on shelves, as its clients are buying ALL THEIR CHIPS.\n\nAMD's valuation is $110 billion, while NVIDIA (w/slightly more revenue &amp; profit) is $500 billion.\n\nHow is NVIDIA 5 times the value of AMD???... Just because of a stock split?\n\nIt is currently trading at 38 times earnings, which if they grow by 50% in 6 months, will certainly drop.\n\nSo yeah, the stock is currently above $90 and aiming to reach its all-time high of $99 which was reached a few months ago, in January.\n\nAnalyst consensus of the stock is currently $106.54 ([https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd/forecast](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd/forecast)) which slightly better than an 18% upside, which would take it to a mere $ 132 billion market cap.\n\nIf you ask me, AMD should be **at least HALF** of NVIDIA's $500 billion market cap.\n\nLastly, the Xilinx acquisition, which will aim to create synergies among functions (e.g. HR, Procurement, Engineering, etc.). It will also increase AMD's share of the silicon purchasing world, as TSMC will have AMD as its #2 client, only second to Apple.\n\nXilinx cancelled its dividends as its shareholders approved the merger with AMD.\n\nAMD may choose to bring dividends back after the merger... yet in the meantime, they announced a $4 Billion share buyback program. They know their stock is trading **CHEAP**.\n\n# On the positions (full disclosure): YES, I hold AMD stock.\n\nI bought $25K back in 2013, when the stock was at $2.46 (on January 18th, 2013), a bit over 10150 stocks. I saw the stock go up to $20 and sold half of it in 2018. Later, I bought back a bit (crazy ape mentality).\n\nToday, I stand with 7500 stocks. Certainly worth a couple of Lambo's, yet I drive a Nissan.\n\nIf you ask me, my next car should be a TESLA... with AMD chips (yet I'm not selling AMD).\n\nWE ALREADY PASSED THE MOON, we will pass **MARS** (Tesla) and also our **Galaxy** (Samsung).\n\n# Join me, together we will conquer the Universe!!!\n\nPack your bananas.... we're in for a journey!",

        "selftext": "Recently I've started to be interested in AMD. First of all, I'm not qualified to give any financial advices, I'm just here to share a few facts, that makes me believe AMD could start to rise before July. It reached this week more than 85$ (after Google announced it was working with AMD for Google's Cloud computing which was huge news), and went back to 82,6$ after a dip that hit both AMD and NVDA. \n\nHere is different articles I found that seem to show that this dip could be an opportunity before a rise : \n\nhttps://www.notebookcheck.net/Exynos-with-AMD-mRDNA-2-to-be-unveiled-in-July-peak-performance-better-than-next-gen-Mali-GPU-while-beating-latest-Mali-even-with-30-throttling-Google-signing-up-for-mRDNA-2-as-well.546822.0.html --&gt; it has been public knowledge for sometime now that Samsung and AMD are working on a mobile GPU, but official announcement should be next month, AND, as mentionned in the article, Google could also use AMD's RDN2 tech for something in short term (Google Pixel?). Concerning Google, this is the third time that I see this rumor. \n\nhttps://www.thestreet.com/investing/amd-no-ec-objection-to-xilinx-merger --&gt; for the moment the acquisition of Xilinx seems to go well \n\nhttps://www.neowin.net/news/amds-next-gen-rdna-3-performance-jump-rumored-to-be-absolutely-insane/ --&gt; some good news about 2022's GPU \n\nI think next earning release is on 07/27/2021 ; we should see good things there. \n\nThere are also the Xbox/PS5 that are a huge success and based on AMD's GPU ; Microsoft and Sony will keep buying tons of AMD's GPU (maybe more than expected originally).\n\nIt's my point of view but, to invest in mid-term, it looks good. \n\nHave fun today!",

        "selftext": "Based on the companies PEG ratio it seems that lam research is in a very unique place when it comes to forward earnings regarding the semi space. The stock continues to be undervalued relative to peers. \n\nI am not big into tech at all. I do own shares on nvidia, AMD, and lam research as of now. Amd and lam have relatively low PEG ratios for stocks expecting the growth that they do and I believe it represents a clear buying opportunity. I understand that lam research has done extremely well this year due to the semiconductor shortage, but I still believe being long lam is a smart move. \n\nI bought lam at $500 with the intention of averaging down and have not had the chance. I will not average up on these names as of now, since I do like my cost basis. But I do believe these names have room to run.\n\nNvidia is an exception I will live with because they do just destroy every expectation set and are a leader in many of their industries. I see their PEG of 3.1 as sustainable and wanted to own them pre-split. I also sold bull put spreads because I believe the case for Nvidia is unique. \n\nThe tech industry is flush with buying opportunities, although I wouldn't necessarily go all in on at a given time, I would put 25% on intended capitol to work and leave cash on the side to play the average as the stock moves. With the inflation and interest theme playing out, I feel there will be more buying opportunities, but I also want skin in the game. I stick to big tech and companies that can handle interest rates rising. \n\nI wouldn't go long on a semi ETF at this point, but I would like some money in the game.\n\nEdit: Qualcomm should be on this list, but I do not follow them. They are great.",

The company CPUs and graphics are highly rated gamers and tech use of them on the rise. With Nvidia I wasn't sure if i'd make a large gain as quickly and the amount of stock in comparison to amd I could comfortably buy.

        "selftext": "AMD is the best run simi company in the world right now.\n\n[Su Bae](https://i.redd.it/dvg5sf39rg471.gif)\n\nAMD stock is being held down by Arbitrage trading due to the all-stock fixed-ratio Xilinx acquisition. Once that acquisition is approved by world regulators, arbitrage will stop and the stock will soar. Note that the acquisition doesn't have to close, it just needs to be approved for the Arbitrage to stop. Once Arbitrage stops, all of the short selling which is holding AMD stock down will stop, and AMD will rocket towards it's price targets between $106-135\n\n**Arbitrage effect on stocks**  \n In an all-stock fixed ratio merger, the hedge fund playbook is to short sell the acquiring stock, AMD, and buy the stock being acquired, XLNX. For example, they will short 1M AMD stock and buy 580k XLNX stock. They will then hold these positions until the acquisition closes, where the 580k XLNX turns into 1M AMD and then they cover their short position, pocketing the price difference. The short selling pushes the price of AMD down, continually, until the arbitrage stops. \n\nRead more on AMD Merger Arbitrage here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n4r47g/amd\\_an\\_explanation\\_on\\_merger\\_arbitrage\\_and\\_how\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n4r47g/amd_an_explanation_on_merger_arbitrage_and_how_to/)\n\nArbitrage will end when the share ratio between XLNX stock and AMD stock is equal, where there's no difference to be gained. Right now the share ratio difference is \\~1.57 or about 10%. The 10% difference is there for the chance that the acquisition does not go through. Once world regulators approve it though, the chance of acquisition is basically 100% and the share ratio difference will be 0. With no difference, the arbitrage trading and short selling stops and the stock rises. In the case of AMD, the average price target is some 30% over today's prices, so it should rocket.\n\n[https:\\/\\/public.tableau.com\\/app\\/profile\\/upndown\\/viz\\/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio\\_16114624177710\\/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio](https://preview.redd.it/gr9sro1mqg471.png?width=1002&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fc21af702904945f5aa76ae8d7d85c1be4c3a84)\n\n**Possibility of Arbitrage ending soon**  \nCEO Dr. Lisa Su has said many times that the acquisition will close by the end of the year. She's also always conservative in her estimates. Remember that she said revenue would increase by 37% in 2021, only to revise it in Q2 to 50% growth. Su, you sly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ligcuvdksg471.gif\n\nYou can track the regulatory approval status over here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD\\_Stock/comments/n9xnu2/regulatory\\_approval\\_status/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/n9xnu2/regulatory_approval_status/)\n\nThe US has already approved and Phase 1 of the approval process for the UK and EU will end on July 6th. If there are no objections, the acquisition is approved from them as well. There are not expected to be any objections. If there were any, they would go into Phase 2, which would end at the end of the year (Lisa's conservative timeline).\n\nThe big question is when will China approve? They're the last ones to give the approval. Well no one really knows when this is going to happen. In Oct. of 2020 AMD said they would be drafting a notification to SAMR (China). But that's really the last we heard of it. \n\nThere's a possibility that China will approve around the same time as the UK and EU, which could be as soon as July 6th. In that case,\n\n[butts](https://preview.redd.it/wsr44v9qlg471.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92b9ec2b60f88b9b5443895e00486e98edfa63ef)\n\nAMD announced on May 19th that it was initiating a $4B stock buyback. And since then it appears that AMD has been buying back it's own stock in big chunks every day around 9:30-10am:\n\n[perdy](https://preview.redd.it/1cmdiz4fng471.png?width=538&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1e1174f74f52798ea863caab6172b972d0698b6)\n\nThe doctor is smart. She knows the arb is keeping the stock down and aims to profit from it. The timing of the buyback may suggest that she thinks the approval is going to happen sooner than the end of the year. \n\nEither way, the stock will rocket once the approval happens. Could be in less than a month, if not, then it'll be end of year. Either way we're making tendies, it's just a matter of how soon. Place your bets!

        "selftext": "I've seen a few other CRSR DD's here lately and wanted to add my own. Corsair likely needs little introduction these days, as their computer components find their way into a huge and increasing number of PC builds. Fans, radiators, keyboards, etc. Their products are great and the way the company is managed is just as good.\n\nThere is unfortunately not much long term data available on the company, as they only recently went public with an IPO in September 2020, when it [debuted at $15 a share](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/23/tech/corsair-ipo-ceo-interview/index.html). However I will do my best to analyze all the data about the company since then to prove Corsair has a great valuation as it currently sits at \\~$32 a share.\n\nAs the above link states, Corsair had a revenue of 1.3 Billion ending in June 2020. Even through the first waves of the pandemic, with closures of factories everywhere, Corsair still managed to rake in cash, which they continue to do so. Using TD Ameritrade's platform thinkorswim, we can see revenue has still been growing since then, massively too. \n\n**Financials**\n\n[TDA's Fundamentals on CRSR](https://preview.redd.it/nevpo4l6zw471.png?width=1595&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1b53934b0273547dee788d0e07b7a98c259fa57)\n\nThere's alot to take in right there, but lets analyze their fundamentals.\n\n* Revenue growth was estimated at 65.75%. For a company to see that much revenue growth during a time that production facilities across the world are shutting down is nothing short of amazing. And that's not all for growth during Covid.\n* Earnings Per Share in the last twelve months is at $1.59, pretty good. What's even better is that this is a 108% increase in the EPS of last year.\n* Book Value Per Share rose similarly, with a yearly increase of 50.39%, bringing it up to $4.76 BVPS.\n* Gross and Net Profit Margins saw in increases of 30.76% and 112.62%, respectively.\n* At the same time, the Debt to Capital ratio dropped through the floor, falling 65.03% to strengthen the company's balance sheet.\n* Financial Leverage decreased by 62.71%, showing their effort in paying off loans on assets.\n\nAs for valuation, Corsair's P/E ratio, the most well known valuation ratio, is at 19.606. Relatively high, but most value investors consider a P/E below 20 to be the range for a decent value stock. On the other hand, P/C and P/B are at 21.299 and 6.2857, higher than desired for value stock considerations. While the P/C and P/B can be used as a counterargument to my thesis, I am willing to overlook these numbers because Corsair's massive growth during a global pandemic highlights that this company can be considered undervalued and a growth stock candidate.\n\nAdditionally, Corsair has nearly [doubled expected earnings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/crsr/earnings) in 2 of the last three quarters. The numbers are as follows:\n\n* Q3, 2020: Expected earnings of .26, actual was .52\n* Q4, 2020: Expected earnings of .56, actual was .52\n* Q1, 2021: Expected earnings of .34, actual was .56\n\nThis indicates Corsair's consistent results, with analysts underestimating the company's potential.\n\nNow, lets look at a chart of CRSR.\n\n**Previous 12 Months**\n\n[Flat as a pancake](https://preview.redd.it/1sfmzvua9x471.png?width=1609&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c243c5ead1888e7339ca7829b2e786764da180ca)\n\nNow, I'm not personally one for technical analysis. I won't go in depth here, but anyone can see that in the last several months, the stock price has barely moved. down from a high of $51.37 per share in November 2020, it has settled at a stable \\~$32 per share, rarely deviating more than a dollar in either direction. Part of this is because of the low volume in recent months. Since March 2021, volume has never gone below 500,000 and never above 4.8 million, with the 4.8 milllion figure being a significant outlier. In the past, Corsair has seen much stronger buy volume and can rise in price quickly, going from its IPO price of $15 in September 2020 to its ATH of $51.37 only two months later.\n\nWhy is this important? A stable stock price means low Implied Volatility. Low Implied Volatility means cheap options. IV is currently at 56.7%, and any increase in stock price above its resistance of $33 will see an increase in the price of all options. ATM weeklies can be as cheap as a $.37 premium per share for calls. LEAPS aren't terribly expensive either, although open interest on long term options is currently low.\n\n**Looking Forward**\n\nAll this already sounds like a great investment, but as I previously mentioned multiple times, these numbers put up by Corsair were all during the Covid pandemic and it's factory shutdowns. As anyone who has tried to build a PC recently will know, semiconductor prices are through the roof currently because of [low supply](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/technology/semiconductor-supply-shortage.html). GPU and CPU production is extremely slow right now, but just starting to pick up steam. Over the past year, [scalpers](https://www.pcmag.com/news/scalpers-have-sold-50000-nvidia-rtx-3000-gpus-through-ebay-stockx) have strangled the computer chip market and alot of people are straight up refusing to pay for these inflated prices. Once production is back in full force and consumers are building more PC's, peripheral sales will spike alongside them. This is where Corsair comes in. If they can put up spectacular growth numbers while a large part of the market sits and waits for prices on critical components goes down, think about what will happen when new AMD chips and NVIDIA graphics cards are being pumped out at breakneck paces, which will soon happen as vaccines are now allowing non essential businesses to ramp up production once again. Most analysts place the [price target](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/CRSR/price-target/) around $50, showing its strong upside.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCorsair is currently showing signs of both a good value investment and growth stock. They demonstrate a decent P/E ratio and increases in EPS, BVPS, revenue, and profit margin, alongside decreases in Debt to Capital ratio and Financial Leverage. The stock price is currently very steady at \\~$32 a share, resulting in low IV and cheap options. As the semiconductor market warms back up as Covid subsides, Corsair sales will increase even more as more people build PC's with Corsair cases, mouses, power supplies, etc.\n\n*Current Positions: 30 shares at $33.73, 20 Aug 21 35C. I plan on buying more shares and options.*\n\n*This is not financial advice. Do your own research.*",

        "selftext": "Intel is currently trading in the mid 50's at a pe ratio of 12.5,  intel is a matured company and no one is looking for a multibagger here and recently it has lost ground to Amd in the consumer cpu market. Now semiconductor shortages has hit everyone hard and won't be reasonable to expect quick turnarounds.\n\nBut the thing is there are not many players in the market and there is no technological threat, the infrastructure and research requirements to even make a cpu, set the entry barrier pretty high but this has breed incompetence at intel  imo. \n\nNow Intel processors are still at least competitive unlike the past years when amd was beaten to the ground by intel. Now this could be the beginning of the downward road for intel if it can't compete with next few launches  but as of today it is simply lagging behind a bit.\n\nNow intel has had a shaddy / unethical reputation with regards to going to extreme ways to win market share, such as designing to perform on specific benchmarks, poaching competitive talent and anti competitive policies and perhaps is not the best place to work. Current management may also be dragging the stock's perceived value, when you look at Lisa su she has been a revelation at amd. \n\nTalking about the stock it also pays a decent dividend, but paying such amounts of dividend when the company has such a huge debt is questionable. Like why won't there be much better use of the money being paid? Also the interest will pile on like this makes no sense?\n\nI think a structural change at intel is the one thing which can revive the stock and the company else amd might do what intel once did to amd, kinda what goes around comes around. What's your take?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: Personally I would go no where close to an intel cpu to build a pc/ gaming laptop, perhaps this is the jist which the price reflects.",

        "selftext": "Hello, fellow apes. This sub has been bringing up one of my favorite stocks right now, **CRSR**, which although undervalued by almost any metric (the street target is sitting at about $47 - right above ATH and 50% upside) yet has been trading flat in the low 30s range. I want to talk about why it stayed so steady, why this makes it the PERFECT opportunity for entry (especially on leaps- low IV on the contracts, but short-term theta is a killer).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Background:** Since CRSR IPO'd in 2020, it has done nothing but surprise investors. Posting its first profitable year, increasing revenues, and paying off debt. Not to mention they threw a few acquisitions in there to further diversify the business. Originally investors were amazed, which caused over a 200% rally in share price. \n\n**Why it's Flat:** Since then, the market has been too worried about the vaccines and reopening efforts hurting their sales. But as we have all probably realized over the past year and a half -  gaming, streaming, and building computers AREN'T GOING ANYWHERE. If anything there are more consumers interested than ever before. CRSR has also taken steps to expand its business and establish itself as one of the biggest sponsors in streaming. Think of Nike or Red Bull - but for Esports. By growing their sponsored gamer teams, they attract the next generation of gamers and consumers who want to have the same products as their favorite gamers - the same way you still buy Jordans.\n\n**Factors for Moon:** The most obvious is the fundamental undervaluation for CRSR. While most stocks keep pushing higher, CRSR has not seen love for months, even after posting great earnings at the beginning of May. While AMD has begun to rally and NVDA hits new ATH, people fail to realize that as they grow so does CRSR. What happens when NVDA or AMD comes out with a new product people buy? They get some CRSR accessories and peripherals to go with their new devices. The market is failing to see the amazing opportunity right in front of it.\n\n**Let us not forget the 22% short interest ratio, which is why the rally last week couldn't hold. The rally also had 20x the average daily volume, if the market begins to realize CRSRs potential soon that type of volume will be normal, and so will a price between $45-$58 (my own targets from DCF model built).** \n\nYet again, what do I know - I'm a  retarded finance student (how did I even get to college) and I eat crayons. Therefore this is not financial advice.\n\n**TLDR;** I believe CRSR is insanely undervalued and it's only a matter of time before it takes off.",

        "selftext": "# Corsair Gaming, Elgato and the streaming industry\n\nI think we are all aware that the gaming and streaming industry is booming. Some people are saying that it was just a **\u201ccovid play\u201d**. I want to see their face when they will realize **how wrong they were**.\n\n# The next super bullish catalysts coming very soon\n\n\\- June 29 : Next Tuesday Corsair will be revealing their latest products with Origin PC, powered by AMD and ASUS\n\n\\- July 15 : It's subsidiary Elgato is releasing a new product (probably a Camera, if confirmed it will sell like hot cakes) ! I'm personnaly very bullish on this one.\n\nCorsair showed that they are ready for the next **DDR5 cycle**, it\u2019s like the 5G but for RAM. I\u2019m not a technician so you can read what they say in their blog post if you want to know more.\n\n# The $35 wall\n\nIf we reach **$35** the boost will be **phenomenal** due to all the shorties selling calls at this price thinking they are **untouchable**. If you don\u2019t own shares of CRSR already you could just enter at these actual cheap prices ($33 to $36) and still have a better price cost than most of the CRSR holders who strongly believe this company is **dramatically undervalued** (spoiler : they are right).\n\nMy position : 350 shares at $36.40\n\n# Insiders selling drama\n\nEagle Tree is a private equity firm that helped Corsair **grow substantially** since 2017. They sold 2 287 511 shares on Monday 14th and 432 989 shares on Tuesday 15th and they still have 54 179 559 shares which is equivalent to 58.5% of ownership. They helped CRSR make **good acquisitions** (Elgato, SCUF, Origin PC\u2026) and now they are **taking some profit**. I honestly don\u2019t know what their plan is so do your own research.\n\nAndy Paul the CEO is 63yo he has all the right to sell 400k shares if he wants after 28 years of **good and loyal service** (he still has 2 584 896 shares left). He can now offer himself a nice boat worth $16M and **be a pirate** in the Caribbean Sea this summer.\n\n# CRSR and LOGI comparison\n\nLogitech is a good company no doubt about that. Let\u2019s compare the last 4 quarters that ended 31st March 2021 of the two companies.\n\nCRSR\n\n* market cap: $3B\n* Revenue: $1.92B\n* Gross Income: $540M\n* Net Income: $149M\n\nLOGI\n\n* market cap: $21.2B\n* Revenue: $4.85B\n* Gross Income: $2.14B\n* Net Income: $875M\n\nYou apes can calculate the **multiples** with some mental arithmetic and be amazed by the results. Let me simplify for you, **Corsair should be worth $10B or $100 a share** if you round it off.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nFeel free to join the **CRSR Gang** composed of respectful **Corsairians** that are convinced this stock will rise to $80-$100 sooner or later and are not willing to sell before this price is reached.\n\nTL;DR: Buy shares, don\u2019t sell calls, **no need to cover anything** (this is obviously **not a financial advice**)",

Lauderdale, FL based parent company of a number of carbonated soft drink brands that you\u2019ve probably heard of and have likely tried in your lifetime, most notably: La Croix, Shasta, and Faygo (for all you former Jugglaos). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ Tastes like someone drank fruit juice and burped into my seltzer water. ](https://preview.redd.it/i7frbmqjzx671.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d0a79f9e59637a3a43e3855589a7a0bee26f041)\n\nWhat makes them a long term buy: They\u2019re competitive among much bigger firms ($KO and $PEP) (think $AMD vs. $INTC). They\u2019ve been consistently increasing market share and profitability. They\u2019re more vertically integrated than competitors: They own both the production and distribution facilities. \n\nThey\u2019re actually profitable with a good long term track record (unlike a lot of other companies being hawked on here). They pay dividends (but not always regularly), and have decent P/E at 25.47 (which is better than KO and the industry average). While slightly less than average EPS at $1.83 is good, it\u2019s better than KO, and they have had huge EPS growth at 42% in the last 12 months. FIZZ has a 16% profit margin while PEP is only 10%. Last but not least, they have almost no long term debt!\n\nTechnically FIZZ has been a steady gainer as well, with 82.7% 12-month price performance and 20% 6-month price performance. They had a 2:1 split at the end of February this year after paying out an enormous $6 per share! special dividend at the end of January. \n\nEarnings is coming up 29 JUN. It\u2019s expected to go down compared to last quarter, but a surprise beat might give the price a bump. Worth noting here that they\u2019ve beat earnings estimates on the last 5/6 periods.\n\nHere\u2019s a couple news articles recently published on FIZZ: \n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/national-beverage-corp-nasdaq-fizz-081255164.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/national-beverage-corp-nasdaq-fizz-081255164.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vxh39w4c0y671.png?width=853&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e13e03baefa2ba6116beb5113de3c9b53e16a6e\n\n [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shareholders-national-beverage-nasdaq-fizz-062856268.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shareholders-national-beverage-nasdaq-fizz-062856268.html) \n\nNow on to the (carbonated) juicy stuff: Long (1 week) before WSB was invaded by apes u/Pcola77 posted an epic DD back on Jan 20: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1aod7/dd\\_on\\_fizz\\_possibly\\_next\\_big\\_short\\_squeeze/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1aod7/dd_on_fizz_possibly_next_big_short_squeeze/) (Note that the short numbers in his DD were based on pre-split shares.) \n\nA week later, on Jan 27, $FIZZ doubled but then dropped back down by Feb. 2. So, $FIZZ already started to squeeze in January, but it seems like everyone forgot about it since then. Short interest declined a bit since January, but hasn\u2019t budged at all since Feb-March, and $FIZZ has been sideways since then\u2026 sound familiar?\n\nIf you read the January DD, you\u2019ll realize that $FIZZ still has the right mixture of: insanely low float of only 18.01 M shares (because most of the company is actually owned by one old guy who hates short sellers), combined with huge short interest of 5.89M shares which creates a 32% short float. But the secret ingredient for this recipe is the crazy low trade volume that makes days to cover (short interest ratio) even higher at nearly 12. This means that it would take more than 2 full weeks of trading to unwind all the short positions, if **EVERY SINGLE TRADE** was a short covering for those full 12 trading days. This days to cover is an order of magnitude higher than GME or CLOV or AMC or BB, which means that it will be that much harder for the shorts to exit their positions. To put a sparkling cherry on top of everything, if $FIZZ announces another dividend, the short sellers have to pay that dividend on shares they sold short.  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80** \n\nPositions: Shares, 10/15 $57.5c, 10/15 $65c\n\nThis is not financial advice.

After a back test yesterday - it looks like we are trying to nail the close this time around.\n\nIn order for that to happen - we need **4 PM on Friday to be above** **84.00.**\n\nThis would trigger a breakout targeting **90** resistance first, followed by **100** and **110.**\n\nMaybe we could overshoot to **125** \\- but I'm going to be selling all/most around that last target.\n\nThis breakout is invalid if we don't get the close - but the pattern will still be alive. It has some room for another trip down - so long as we hold **72.50.**\n\nOverall a pretty textbook chart setup - don't overthink it. I'm looking @ **August 90c** for this one, I might roll them back when we get ITM.\n\nPost breakout - I'll be putting a stop loss at **83.00.**\n\nThe move should play out over **2-3** months.",

This pushes AMD to MARS... as  autonomous driving is a perfect for gaming.\n\nWe  had Google signing a contract to adopt Milan Epyc Datacenter CPUs for virtual machine offerings... SMOKING intel. HUGE DATACENTER WIN, as the TCO is dropped dramatically.\n\nWe had the 6900XTX Liquid Cooled breaking World Records (previously held by the 6900XT).\n\nWe have Valve releasing a new handheld with AMD by the holiday season 2021.\n\nWe have Fidelity FX Super Resolution with AMAZING FPS boosts in Ultra Quality and Quality modes (launching tomorrow).\n\nWe  have the AMD Advantage Program for LAPTOPS allowing for a 5900HX (TOP  mobile CPU) to be paired with a RX 6800M, an VALUE HIGH-END mobile GPU.  Giving Mobile 3080 like performance at $1650, with high refresh monitor  (300Hz on 1080p to 140Hz on 1440p).\n\nBut now... it is Samsung's latest info.\n\nWe knew AMD was coming in the Galaxy S22.... but it gets BETTER!!!\n\nThe  performance of RDNA2 in mobile is beating expectations... and SAMSUNG  is signing a future deal with AMD... as they are SUPER PLEASED with  AMD's performance. Samsung will effectively ABANDON their GPU plans and  work with AMD going forward.\n\nBut that IS NOT ALL.... GOOGLE also wants AMD in their Mobiles.\n\nGoogle, the Android software developer... wants AMD. This is NUTS.\n\n[https://videocardz.com/newz/samsung-reportedly-already-negotiating-contract-with-amd-for-mrdna-successor](https://videocardz.com/newz/samsung-reportedly-already-negotiating-contract-with-amd-for-mrdna-successor)\n\nTo summarize,\n\n**AUTONOMOUS DRIVING:**\n\nHuge Partnership with TELSA for GPU's and APU's. More manufacturers to join soon!\n\n**GAMING (Consoles &amp; PC):**\n\nConsoles: PS5, Xbox X/S, Valve handheld, Aya Neo.\n\nPC (CPU): Zen3 with stacked cache coming late this year (15% IPC expected). Zen4 in Q2 2022.\n\nPC (GPU): 6900XTX, 6800M available. Fidelity FX SR tomorrow!!! RDNA3 MCM coming next year.\n\n**DATACENTER:**\n\nGoggle wants Milan Epyc for Virtual Machine service offerings. Tencent and Alibaba coming next!\n\nDatacenter chips with 128 Cores (256 threads) coming next year!!!\n\n**MOBILE (phones):**\n\nAMD making a HUGE entrance into the Samsung Galaxy with RDNA2. Google wants AMD too!!!\n\nAMD is now officially EVERYWHERE. From \"El Capitan\" Dept. of Energy to **EVERY popular gaming hardware &amp; software solution**.... including mobile phones.\n\nThis was the last catalyst... the stock will now retest the $81.70... and surge towards $130.\n\nXilinx has been given a Green Light by all major regulators.\n\nMILKY WAY HERE WE COME!!!",

I purposely didn\u2019t go too crazy so I didn\u2019t stand to lose much, but seeing as how it spent pretty much all of June falling gradually from my initial buy in, is it safe to say I should abandon this journey now and reinvest that money into something else?\n\nAny advice appreciated, sorry if this is low level stuff.

Reason being that as the whales get squeezed out of their short positions, they will have to liquidate other assets, and the easiest one to liquidate ia \u00e7rypt\u00f4. \nThen, as buttcoin drops, the Tether scam falls apart, taking the whole \u00e7rypt\u00f4 market down amd instigating a mini-crash. \n\nI've sold off all my \u00e7rypt\u00f4 stocks ($RIOT $MARA $SOS) in anticipation of this, and plan to buy that dip after the triple rockets approach re-entry\n\nAny thoughts?",

Obviously we\u2019re all not gonna have the same opinions but I think this list is a good guide. Let me know what ya think. I\u2019m of the opinion that the market is going to rotate towards beaten down growth stocks but not the ones that are extremely high flyers. For example, some stocks that made the list are those such as AMD, SoFi, and Disney. I think the most controversial part of where I think the market is headed is in regards to Chinese companies. \n\nI am of the opinion that companies like JD.com, Alibaba and even though it didn't make my list, Baidu will see significant recoveries in the coming months. Although, I won't rule out the idea of them being value traps entirely and I could understand investor fears relating to them as their is so much uncertainty.\n\nThanks for hearing me out and for any ideas you may have.\n\n\nhttps://www.fosterfinancialfreedom.com/post/stock-market-power-rankings-july-2021",
