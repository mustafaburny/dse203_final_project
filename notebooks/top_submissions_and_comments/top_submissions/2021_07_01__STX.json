        "selftext": "First off, I looked at the two exchanges combined, so I will refer to them as the TSX even though I am talking about the TSX and TSXV combined.  There are a few thousand companies in the TSX.\n\nOf these, about 80% have little or no revenue, and have massive accumulated deficits offset by large issues equity (The companies lose money YoY, and to stay afloat they sell more and more shares each year).  This really destroys shareholder value, and makes these companies toxic.  Most of these companies are mining, materials or exploration companies by category, but in reality they just own a plot of land they believe has some resource buried deep in it.  I read through the annual reports for about ten of these companies.  The reports are very simple, and it is clear that they have deep issues in operations and financials.\n\nThere are a number of SPAC like companies that offer little promise.  They claim that they are a resource or manufacturing company - but looking deep into their operations the words \"planned manufacturing\" or \"future acquisitions\" are prevalent in any discussion about operations or assets.  These companies have nothing going on.  They may have some ideas or plans, some capital to carry out these plans, but they don't actually own or do anything.  There are hundreds of these companies.\n\nThere are a few promising small cap companies, and more promising mid to large cap companies.  I have tabulated 110 companies that have some promise or have good current operations.  These are all my opinion, and I haven't considered at all any of the financial states of these companies - I have only read a blurb about what the company does, and looked at the size and current earnings in some cases.  Some may have great operations, some may be horribly unprofitable, but all are distinguished as doing something other than thinking about mining or buying real estate.

        "selftext": "Of these, about 80% have little or no revenue, and have massive accumulated deficits offset by large issues equity (The companies lose money YoY, and to stay afloat they sell more and more shares each year).  This really destroys shareholder value, and makes these companies toxic.  Most of these companies are mining, materials or exploration companies by category, but in reality they just own a plot of land they believe has some resource buried deep in it.  I read through the annual reports for about ten of these companies.  The reports are very simple, and it is clear that they have deep issues in operations and financials.\n\nThere are a number of SP\\*C like companies that offer little promise.  They claim that they are a resource or manufacturing company - but looking deep into their operations the words \"planned manufacturing\" or \"future acquisitions\" are prevalent in any discussion about operations or assets.  These companies have nothing going on.  They may have some ideas or plans, some capital to carry out these plans, but they don't actually own or do anything.  There are hundreds of these companies.\n\nThere are a few promising small cap companies, and more promising mid to large cap companies.  I have tabulated 110 companies that have some promise or have good current operations.  These are all my opinion, and I haven't considered at all any of the financial states of these companies - I have only read a blurb about what the company does, and looked at the size and current earnings in some cases.  Some may have great operations, some may be horribly unprofitable, but all are distinguished as doing something other than thinking about mining or buying real estate.

        "selftext": "Of these, about 80% have little or no revenue, and have massive accumulated deficits offset by large issues equity (The companies lose money YoY, and to stay afloat they sell more and more shares each year).  This really destroys shareholder value, and makes these companies toxic.  Most of these companies are mining, materials or exploration companies by category, but in reality they just own a plot of land they believe has some resource buried deep in it.  I read through the annual reports for about ten of these companies.  The reports are very simple, and it is clear that they have deep issues in operations and financials.\n\nThere are a number of SP\\*C like companies that offer little promise.  They claim that they are a resource or manufacturing company - but looking deep into their operations the words \"planned manufacturing\" or \"future acquisitions\" are prevalent in any discussion about operations or assets.  These companies have nothing going on.  They may have some ideas or plans, some capital to carry out these plans, but they don't actually own or do anything.  There are hundreds of these companies.\n\nThere are a few promising small cap companies, and more promising mid to large cap companies.  I have tabulated 110 companies that have some promise or have good current operations.  These are all my opinion, and I haven't considered at all any of the financial states of these companies - I have only read a blurb about what the company does, and looked at the size and current earnings in some cases.  Some may have great operations, some may be horribly unprofitable, but all are distinguished as doing something other than thinking about mining or buying real estate.

        "selftext": "This is the second time my account has been disabled (locked) from trading/transferring/staking.\n\nThe first time it happened I spend HOURS messaging back and forth with OKCOIN's customer service team. They couldn't give me a straight answer. Just 'check with your bank' and eventually they told me to 'reach out to customeroutreach@okcoin.'\n\nAlright, it's their process so let's try it. I spent more time talking to my bank as per OKCOIN's instructions to check ACH with my bank. My bank advised me that OKCOIN coded something wrong on their end and maybe that's why the transaction didn't go through. \n\nI thought okay fine, accidents happen, no big deal. So I reached out to OKCOIN again for help. And after MANY emails with OKCOIN to reach a solution, they didn't do what they said they would and instead TOOK my Bitcorn instead of the cash I had deposited. I rebought Bitcorn again and it wasn't a lot so whatever. I thought maybe they are just unorganized and I gave OKCOIN the benefit of the doubt.\n\nNow I try Staking STX and OKCOIN won't let me because my account is locked. I get the same excuse from OKCOIN about an \"ACH problem\" and to \"check with your bank\".\n\nMy bank shows my deposits went through to OKCOIN. Money left my bank account and went to OKCOIN in the correct amount.\n\nI reached out to the customer service team via chat about this issues and they were no help - got the same 'reach out to customeroutreach@okcoin.' So I reached out to customeroutreach@okcoin and they only give vague answers, that they \"cannot confirm the information about the incorrect transaction\". And to check with my bank regarding my ACH details.\n\nThis doesn't make sense to me. Has anyone else had a similar experience?\n\nSorry for the rant but anyone else having a hard time dealing with these guys? I'm usually a pretty chill dude but this is starting to get on my nerves.\n\nHopefully we can just use OKCOIN's exchange as advertised without jumping through these hoops. Maybe I'm an isolated case, but if not, it doesn't seem like they can keep operating like this and be sustainable.\n\nNote: I don't know where else to post this since I keep getting blocked by bots on other subreddits due to low Karma.",

        "selftext": "Of these, about 80% have little or no revenue, and have massive accumulated deficits offset by large issues equity (The companies lose money YoY, and to stay afloat they sell more and more shares each year).  This really destroys shareholder value, and makes these companies toxic.  Most of these companies are mining, materials or exploration companies by category, but in reality they just own a plot of land they believe has some resource buried deep in it.  I read through the annual reports for about ten of these companies.  The reports are very simple, and it is clear that they have deep issues in operations and financials.\n\nThere are a number of SP\\*C like companies that offer little promise.  They claim that they are a resource or manufacturing company - but looking deep into their operations the words \"planned manufacturing\" or \"future acquisitions\" are prevalent in any discussion about operations or assets.  These companies have nothing going on.  They may have some ideas or plans, some capital to carry out these plans, but they don't actually own or do anything.  There are hundreds of these companies.\n\nThere are a few promising small cap companies, and more promising mid to large cap companies.  I have tabulated 110 companies that have some promise or have good current operations.  These are all my opinion, and I haven't considered at all any of the financial states of these companies - I have only read a blurb about what the company does, and looked at the size and current earnings in some cases.  Some may have great operations, some may be horribly unprofitable, but all are distinguished as doing something other than thinking about mining or buying real estate.

Our valuation model shows that profit margins are the second most important driver of company valuations today, behind only equity duration,\" said [David Kostin](https://news.yahoo.com/stock-market-faces-two-big-headwinds-goldman-sachs-183809756.html), Goldman Sachs chief U.S. equity strategist, in a new research note to clients.\u00a0\n\nKostin outlined 32 companies spanning the health care, industrial, materials, staples and information technologies sectors that have above average net profit margins and are likely to expand them further in 2021 (see below). The median return on these stocks year-to-date has tallied 14%.\u00a0\n\n[ Some companies have outsized potential to expand profit margins this year, says Goldman Sachs. ](https://preview.redd.it/07xk6nh60ua71.png?width=705&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fab78e909f3124688a84696179acb6a10305bc78)\n\nSome of the top-performing stocks include Old Dominion Freight Line, NortonLifeLock, Applied Materials, Seagate Technologies and Freeport-McMoran. All of these names are seen increasing their earnings in excess of 30% this year, compared to 19% for the S&amp;P 500 (excluding financials and utilities).\u00a0\n\nAnd all of them have outperformed the S&amp;P 500's year-to-date gain of 16%. Other stocks such as Netflix and Newmont Corporation have lagged the S&amp;P 500's year-to-date performance, but could be poised to return to favor among investors amid the prospect for each company's profit margins this year (see above chart).\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\"S&amp;P 500 margins notched a record high of 11.9% in 1Q 2021, though investors remain focused on the forward margin outlook given rising input costs,\" Kostin explains.\u00a0\n\nStrategists are banking on more than the 32 companies outlined by Goldman to expand profit margins this year. The only question is will companies sustain those gains into 2022 given uncertainties around inflation and taxes.\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 is seen rising 11.2% over the next 12 months, according to analysis from FactSet. At the sector level, energy and materials are expected to show the largest gains in valuation (17.1% and 15.9%, respectively).\u00a0\n\n[***Brian Sozzi***](https://www.yahoo.com/author/brian-sozzi/) ***is an editor-at-large and*** [***anchor at Yahoo Finance***](https://finance.yahoo.com/videos/)***.

        "selftext": "Hi Apes,\n\nLet me start off by saying all the below does not constitute financial advice, and is provided for my smooth brained chad bros looking for a relief from meme stocks. \n\n$WDC is undervalued vs comps. September will bring a correction. Analyst avg target price is $92 with a high of $120. \n\nHedge funds and analysts are bullish on $WDC because they realize that compared to competition (Seagate, Kioxia) $WDC is undervalued. **$WDC currently has a record amount of smart money interest with 58 holding a long position**\n\n# Background:\n\nWestern Digital Corporation manufactures storage devices: Hard Drives (HDDs) and Solid State Drives (SSDs and other NAND products).\n\nThey have two separate business units managing their HDD and SSD portfolios.\n\n# Product:\n\n**If you don't know what NAND is...** think 64GB iphone vs 256GB iphone. That is NAND storage \"memory\". The vast majority of all electronics now use NAND storage (phones, PCs, gaming, servers, cars, cameras, etc.)\n\n**HDDs are a slower form of storage**, and although the technology is dated... it is very cheap on a $/GB basis. Hard drives are used increasingly in datacenters and servers.\n\n# Market\n\nThe **NAND market is going through a pricing upcycle** with prices expected to increase rapidly in Q3 and into Q4 during the holiday season.\n\nOn top of this, datacenter demand for both SSDs and HDDs are going crazy because of COVID with the increasing use of video conferencing, file sharing, video streaming, and remote work. This is driving up the demand for both HDDs and SSDs.\n\nLarge **datacenter customers have been increasing their demand forecasts for all of 2021** for both HDDs and SSDs, and $WDC has been a huge beneficiary.\n\nOn top of this, **Chia cryptomining relies on HDD storage capacity**. Chia is causing a huge influx of demand from both Asia and Europe driving up the prices and demand for hard drives (HDD).\n\n# Why is $WDC undervalued?\n\n* Let's compare $WDC to their largest HDD competitor Seagate $STX.\n   * According to $STX valuation (table below), 1% of the HDD market is worth $0.54B in Market Cap.\n   * **By this measure $WDC's HDD business is worth $19.5B**\n   * This means $WDC's SSD business is worth $3.5B and adjusting for their $9B debt to acquire this business we can say **their SSD business is valued by the market at \\~$12.5B**\n\n|Supplier|Market Share (HDD)|Market Cap|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|$WDC|36%|$23B|\n|$STX|43%|$23.3B|\n\n\\[source\\]([https://blocksandfiles.com/2021/05/19/seagate-cements-top-hhd-market-share-spot-as-areal-density-growth-stalls/](https://blocksandfiles.com/2021/05/19/seagate-cements-top-hhd-market-share-spot-as-areal-density-growth-stalls/))\n\n* **Is a $12.5B valuation for $WDC's SSD business fair?**\n   * To answer this question let's compare WDC to Kioxia.\n   * WDC and Kioxia are a similar size in the NAND market. They each have 12-13% market share.\n   * Kioxia (formerly Toshiba) is set to IPO in September  \n\n      * Analysts are valuing the IPO between $30B - $36B\n      * Micron and WDC were rumored to be in acquisition talks to purchase Kioxia at $26 - $30B. (shut down by low likelihood of regulatory approvals)\n   * **Answer: No, their SSD business is undervalued by at least 2-3x**\n\n# Conclusion\n\nI live and breath the semiconductor market, and there isn't another stock available today with the low valuation and near-term tailwinds that I see for $WDC. I fully expect $WDC to rip between now and September as news of the Kioxia IPO valuation are released.\n\n*These comments do not constitute financial advice.*\n\n# Positions\n\n$WDC  \n17c $60 call 1/21/22  \n2c $70 call 10/15 (and adding)\n\n$MU  \n20p $60 put 6/17/22  \n30p $47.5 put 6/17/22",
