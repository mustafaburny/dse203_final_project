After several weeks of thoughtful consideration and research, I have finally made a decision to...\n\n\\[Double down\\](https://imgur.com/a/zlXWOOh) on my bet, like any decent retard residing in this cozy place would do.\n\nBut first things first, let's revise the original bet, \\[the underlying post and analysis\\](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets\\_revive\\_the\\_buried\\_wsb\\_culture\\_gme\\_to/).\n\n(I\u2019m not a financial advisor, just a retard who enjoys writing big texts and making risky bets)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Chapter I. The short, the squeeze, and the ugly manipulation\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk, so a couple(ish) of moths ago I handcrafted that TA thesis (on which the beard bet is based) for GME price action and its potential move to lower thousands as the short squeeze progresses:\n\n*Processing img 5sldutzq33j71...*\n\nThe thesis above was not a generic 'you are here' type of posts you got used to seeing occasionally here and there through the last half a year. Rather, it was a fair attempt to critically assess the stonk's technical setup through the prism of the two most famous SS historical examples:\n\n*Processing img h7b6sm9t43j71...*\n\n*Processing img iz041qtv43j71...*\n\n  \n\\[The OC post and analysis\\](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets\\_revive\\_the\\_buried\\_wsb\\_culture\\_gme\\_to/) (which is still worth your reading, especially if you want to grasp this chapter of the post in greater detail) took me a lot of effort to produce, and I am still proud to have done this work, distilling the essential components of a short squeeze structure, and creating at least some sort of a framework to apply in cases like the current one. However, GME price during the summer did not follow the pattern, and particularly its most anticipated triangular 'Squieezluminati Confirmed' stage.\n\n*Processing img ncwwuqz253j71...*\n\n  \nDoes it render the whole thing void? Well, that's what I've been thinking in August while morally preparing myself for the beard apostasy. But something didn't quiet fit, and I kept digging. Just to stumble upon this:\n\n*Processing img 58sg96eg53j71...*\n\nLooks familiar, doesn't it? Ladies and apemen, with a great pleasure I present you AMCSS, the timing of which is really similar to what I was betting my beard on in relation to GME. What happened to AMC during the summer actually proves almost every single point from my SS thesis. Firstly, the 'Purple Haze' level ($14.38) is the main resistance on the chart, and only when the breakout occurs, the SS unfolds. Secondly, 'Squeezy Grail' (the cup shaped consolidation) and the 'Runway' (rectangle) phases precede the squeeze impulse - that's where the buying pressure accumulates, to the point when it can no longer be suppressed. Next, interestingly enough, trend based Fibonacci periods grid allows to predict the peak date (vertical line marked as 1) extremely accurately, if the preliminary trend + the 'Squeezy Grail' phase are used as its core measurement (red dashed line). But wait, there's more! The 'Purple Haze' resistance is in between 1 and 0.786 Fibo levels (horizontal), while the retracement itself measures the amplitude of the SS impulse perfectly - e.g. take a look at how the price action retraces to 0.5 Fibo after the peak, or how the price consolidates in the channel of 0.236-0.382 after that. Well, the thesis fits almost perfectly to AMC - I hope you're now sitting like\n\n*Processing img nltp4a1l53j71...*\n\nThere are several minor deviations from the SS frameworks which should be mentioned too, though: the PH breakout occurs during 0.618 Fibo period, rather than 0.382, as it was in historical examples; the triangular phase doesn't really resemble a triangle. Notwithstanding those minor factors, original SS thesis is more than alive with the AMC example.\n\nYou might be thinking now: what defuq is this crazy dude is talking about, where is the video of the beard shaved? Well, I'm providing the AMCSS analysis here in order to prove that my thesis is legitimate, and GME price action had to follow the pattern. GME and AMC are like brothers in arms, with 'similar' fundamentals, and through the major part of 2021 those two have been moving in tandem, strongly following linear correlation principle. The thesis structure (built upon TSLA and VW historical examples) indicates that there is the strong buying pressure accumulating, and in AMC example the lid was opened for a bit to let the steam out; while GME is still being suppressed even further during the current consolidation, and in my opinion - it is done artificially and purposely.\n\nFurthermore, take a look at this:\n\n*Processing img 44m2qp2q53j71...*\n\n  \nWhat you see above is the screenshot from \\[my other post\\](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwub7d/gme\\_to\\_amc\\_and\\_bb\\_last\\_week\\_ladies\\_go\\_first\\_gme/), where I explained that two stonks had extremely similar technical setups: both have long-ass triangular consolidation at the core, which is subsequently broken out to the upside. Next, take a look at MACDs or TSIs from both examples, and particularly at what is highlighted by rectangles - zoom in and see for yourself, the structures are close to being identical. So, the question arises: why if two stocks have very similar fundamental and technical backgrounds, one is allowed to moon a little bit, while the other one is being knocked out each time right before the lift off should occur? The answer if fairly obvious, and it's because some big financial boys want things to go this way. AMC is something they can control, or maybe they even benefit from it\u2019s price fluctuations. While GME is a Pandora box, and they try to keep its lid close for as long as possible, soothed by an illusion of a controllable chaos. And those suckers are ready to use any method to suppress the price, especially \\*\\*insert Aliens Guy meme here\\*\\*: manipulation.\n\nApes from a friendly sub uncovered many such methods, like good old FTDs, married puts, OTC trades, wash sales, darkpools... I'm not going to discuss those things in this post, because there is a plenty of outstanding DD on reddit. I'm just going to borrow this picture from u/AutoDrafter2020 because it speaks for itself, in my opinion:\n\n*Processing img klztgzo563j71...*\n\nAs you can see yourself, every major piece of fundamentally good news for GME has resulted in price suppression, and each of the dirty play instruments mentioned above played a role in this shitshow to one degree or another. The manipulation is so blatantly obvious that it makes me sick. Manipulating the market is not cheap, and probably costs fuckers on the other side of the trade millions, if not billions every month. Why would there be so much effort and resources put into the war over a \u2018memestonk\u2019? Is it so that they want some random noname reddit retard to lose his precious beard? The actual answer is shocking, and in my opinion it should be sought in two Greek letters, **\u03c3 (sigma)** and **\u03b2 (beta**).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Chapter II. How 1987 and 2008 are reincarnating into 2021\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPepperidge apes should remember that during one of the Gamestop congressional hearings Vlad 'the Stock Implaler' Tenev mentioned something about late January events falling into five-sigma category, which scientifically speaking corresponds to a p-value, or probability, of 3x10-7, or about 1 in 3.5 million. He also used such a hackneyed expression as a 'black swan' event. Quote from a \\[Bloomberg article\\](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-19/gamestop-hearing-robinhood-is-cool-but-is-it-out-of-its-depth):  \n\n\n&gt;A \u201cblack swan\u201d event \u2014 made famous by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in a best seller that parsed the role of randomness in finance and life \u2014 comes as a surprise, has great impact and later becomes rationalized away as easily explained or predicted. *Many things that appear to be black swans, however, aren\u2019t unforeseeable and are merely classified as such to avoid responsibility for not spotting them ahead of time in the first place*. A \u201cfive-sigma event\u201d is a statistical descriptor of something that occurs five standard deviations away from and on either side of the mean in a data set. It describes the odds of something happening, and in five-sigma territory the odds are long.\n\n  \nCategorizing January craze as five sigma is debatable to say the least, because Gamestop shares started to skyrocket and multiply in price long before late January, and it doesn't take a lot of wrinkles to understand that the volatility should likely increase further, requiring additional collateral and somewhat decent risk management. However, I'm not going to discuss Vlad's choice of sacrificing Robbinhood users (disabling buy button) in order to protect the solvency of Robbinhood customers (Citadel and co), because that has been done enough times already, and the North remembers. Rather, Robbinhood example and Vlad's interpretation are provided here as a vivid illustration of the fact which we all feel deep inside: there is just too much risk in the market, it is being too much fucking over-leveraged so that even a fucking retail stock broker may easily get margin-called in a matter of hours. It is especially hilarious, considering the fact that unsophisticated actions of buying and holding a particular stock is enough to fuck the system, making the entire house of cards fall apart. The problem is that when you dive deeper, 2008 seem to be a blessing.  \n\n\nFor example, let's start from the easy difficulty, take a look at this chart:\n\n*Processing img 47plfcth63j71...*\n\nOne of the major indicators of how the leverage is utilized is FINRA's margin statistics from its members (who carry margin accounts for customers), which FINRA publishes every month. There are several points of interest for us on the chart above. The first and the most important one is that margin dept has tripled after previous major bottom in 2009, from about $300 billions to almost $900 bn in 2021. Furthermore, take a look at how MD reaches the peak of $500 bn both in 2000 and 2007, and it's sufficient to send S&amp;P into several years bear market with 50% retrace, as soon as the leveraging trend reverses. Currently, MD is on its way to trilly, the figure has almost doubled compared to 2000 and 2007. Sounds a bit GUHy, doesn't it? Also, looking at the margin debt before the .com bubble, 2007 financial crisis and Covid crash it can be seen that, each time, the margin contraction starts before the crash itself, making MD a leading indicator. And guess what? MD is down 4.3% in July, which is the first major decline in 15 months. Deleveraging is a painful process, but is necessary for markets\u2019 health, and it seem to have already begun.\n\nHowever, this time it is going to be so much fucking worse. To quote a brilliant mind, u/Criand:  \n\n\n&gt;2008 never finished. It was can-kicked and the same people who caused the crash have still been running rampant doing the same bullshit in the derivatives market as that market continues to be unregulated. They're profiting off of short-term gains at the risk of killing their institutions and potentially the global economy.\n\nI strongly recommend you reading his informative 2008 post in full, because it is a fascinating financial journey, through which you will learn a lot about how fuk the financial system really is right now, largely because of leverage. Imagine if r/WallStreetBets was a central bank. Fuck, this must be the most spot on metaphor I came up with in my entire life. Actually, it seems now that the entire financial world is one fucking giant WSB right now. And not in the good sense of its reputation.\n\nTo quote another brilliant mind, u/peruvian_bull, whose series of posts has been peer-reviewed by an economics professor:  \n\n\n&gt;The entire derivatives market is HUGE. The BIS estimated the total notional value of the OTC derivatives market to be $640 Trillion in 2019! And that doesn't even include exchange-listed derivatives like most common option contracts. More sober estimates put it somewhere north of $1 Quadrillion. Numbers of this size are hard to wrap your head around - this is equivalent to a million billion, or a thousand trillion- for reference, the US economy is around $22 Trillion and the world economy is estimated to be $88 Trillion - thus the entire world economy could fit into the notional derivatives market 11x over and STILL not reach it. Every single bank is exposed, either directly or indirectly, to this market. For example, Deutsche Bank ALONE has over $47 Trillion in Notional gross exposure - TWICE the size of the entire US Economy!\n\n*Processing img enhgxe0773j71...*\n\n*Intermediate TL;DR: the financial market is sufficiently levered according to its risk tolerance, and we all know what comes after that:*\n\n*Processing img 2pb2k9qv63j71...*\n\nThis represents what Buffet called \u201cA Time Bomb\u201d in the market - as long as money flows in, the party continues. Once it stops, the Weapons of Financial Destruction are unleashed. As you may remember, something like that happened in 2008, when predatory lending targeting low-income homebuyers, excessive risk-taking by global financial institutions,\n\n*Processing img xct7amb273j71...*\n\nand the burst of the US housing bubble culminated in a perfect shitstorm. MBSs (Mortgage Backed Securities) tied to American real estate, as well as a vast web of linked to those MBSs CDOs, collapsed in value. As a result, financial institutions worldwide suffered severe damage, the GDP contracted sharply, the unemployment rates rose significantly, pushing millions of people into poverty - largely because some greedy bastards who had too much of financial power based on over-abused leverage and close to zero risk management made all the wrong decisions they could.\n\nThanks God, they promised not to do that again!\n\n*Processing video 1rflh5jy33j71...*\n\n  \n\\*\\*In Tyler\u2019s voice\\*\\* So that was a fucking lie:\n\n*Processing img f9xgxitt73j71...*\n\nThe figures above provide the relatively up-to-date exposure of the the biggest commercial banks towards derivatives. Although, we shouldn\u2019t expect that those numbers allow to calculate somewhat precise leverage ratios, inasmuch as many of these derivative obligations net each other out, rendering the real value of the debt to be a bit more modest (or maybe not, who knows what\u2019s really going on OTC). What is safe to assume, however, is that based on the numbers above, the leverage ratio is still in double digits at least for the biggest and most systemically important banks. From the recent infamous Archegos example, we saw that playing with leverage-amplifying synthetic market instruments (total return swaps in Bill Hwang\u2019s case) is like playing with matches - and it will almost certainly lead to dire consequences at some point in time. Poor Bill just was the first one to run out of luck.\n\nAnother important factor to bear in mind, is that those professional financial ANALysts seem to follow a similar risks assessment approach that is used by an average WSB retard buying FDs. No, I\u2019m not kidding, they literally stick to a bit more sophisticated version of a famous postulate: \u2018Stonks only go up\u2019. We are talking about VaR, or Value at Risk models. u/peruvian_bull managed to explain this complex stuff in a brilliant way in his series of posts dedicated to the highly probable upcoming financial market fiasco (fascinating reading - in this part of the series, 1987 famous crash is discussed and how derivatives and improper risks assessment exacerbated it):\n\n*Processing img zfh3tjyk83j71...*\n\n&gt;Even to this day, Regulators, and indeed even financial industry insiders, are completely blind to the risk. OTC Derivatives are essentially unregulated - NO ONE knows the true size of this market. Worse yet, the traders inside the bank are using optimistic versions of the Efficient Market Hypothesis and VaR models to estimate their risk, which comes out to essentially 0 due to the risk models and net exposure hedging. Thus, they pile on more risk every day, ensuring that this problem continues to grow - until the entire system explodes.\n\n  \nNo wonder, that in such a financial environment as described above, cases like GME would be given a five-sigma label. The best analogy to describe current financial market conditions would be a castle made of sand, when one sea wave of a higher magnitude can easily crash the whole thing into the dirt; or a house of cards, when just one stronger blow of the wind will trigger a chain reaction and demolish it to the fundament. The current status quo is not self-sustainable, and very soon it will become also a not FED-sustainable. The markets have been artificially supported by the money supply expansion for too long, currently resembling a drugs addict, who can\u2019t live without the always following stimulus \u201cdose\u201d. As soon as liquidity dries up for a brief moment (sucked in by some negative beta bad boy), or the FED blinks... I guess, we\u2019ll find out really soon what happens then.\n\nTo conclude and sum up the second chapter, quoting u/peruvian_bull again:  \n\n\n&gt;**As long as money keeps flowing into the Casino, the gamblers feel little risk, so no one pulls out. The Fed continues to print money, equity/bond prices continue to rise, and since there\u2019s \u201cno risk\u201d of the underlying falling in value, everyone keeps their money in the pot, and the poker game continues.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The profits made from derivatives trading are enormous, and any bank that stopped doing this would quickly lose investors, because they would instantly take their capital out and take it to another bank that actually is profitable. It's all a confidence game - as long as everyone is confident, prices keep rising, and the cash keeps pumping in, the party will continue.**\n\n# Chapter III. The Sword of Damocles (and the bet)\n\n  \nWell, here comes the party pooper, or it\u2019s more appropriate to say, the party shitter:\n\n*Processing img nw7vw0dk93j71...*\n\n*Processing img ebo8be5r93j71...*\n\n*Processing img kqwqmy9t93j71...*\n\nConnecting the dots: when there is too much risk in the system, it becomes less and less sustainable, so that potentially even a short but sudden and intense surge in volatility may demolish the whole house of ~~leverage~~cards. Anything may cause a fatal error in such a system, even an old man\u2019s fart with the sigma of five. In our example however, it\u2019s when crazy retail jumps on the hype train, and buys over-shorted stonk like there\u2019s no tomorrow, things look like this:\n\n* GME shares added more than 500% in less than two days, showing off its negative beta in all glory,\n* making VIX volatility index explode more than 60% in a day,\n* and injuring SPY badly (sharp decline of about 4% in 21 hours).\n\nThat was just a preview.\n\nLate January events are extraordinary, that\u2019s for sure. But, you know, extraordinary things happen too, and it\u2019s plainly stupid not to hedge in such circumstances, as Robbinhood did in this story. That was a vivid example of an extremely poor risk management, prevalent on the financial markets currently. This factor, coupled with the excessive margin exploitation (e.g. a fucking reported triple digits SI, dafuq?), will consequently result in the financial crisis, which is currently on its way (remember, crises love September and October).\n\nAfter a rather fascinating set of circumstances, GME situation seems to have become the needle to burst the bubble, that\u2019s why big financial boys use all of their dirty tricks, flirting with an illusion of a controllable chaos. However, any manipulation has its end, and it is a double edged sword (of Damocles). The market will punish the bad actors, as it has always done so in the past - and the good guys will be remunerated. Again, GME is not the reason of the upcoming market crash, but rather a trigger, and in the current financial environment anything could work as a substitute. What was that quote from the \u2018Butterfly Effect\u2019 movie? Oh,  \n\n\n&gt;It has been said that something as insignificant as the gases emitted from an anus of an old man can ultimately cause a financial typhoon all around the world...\n\n  \n**Enough words and quotes. This is my bet: GME to thousands in a couple of months, while the new financial crisis unveiling, or I\u2019m not only shaving off my beard (which I wasn\u2019t really afraid of loosing, tbh, as it would grow back in a couple of months) but also this, my real treasure:**\n\n*Processing video m0gwzvob43j71...*\n\n**And here is why I\u2019m so confident in my bet and its timing:**  \n\n\n*Processing img w51ks5l2b3j71...*\n\nI mean, SPY is cooked. What's outlined on the TA above is a massive bearish formation, ready to push the market off the cliff it has been climbing all this time. In my opinion, that's going to be just the first wave of the nasty downside movement, and a very sharp and painful one. Considering the longer term setup, explained \\[here\\](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mwevzz/the\\_big\\_short\\_20\\_why\\_bears\\_may\\_soon\\_reconsider/), and \\[here\\](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o0fjdb/this\\_time\\_its\\_different/), the technical (as well as fundamentals, as discussed above) conditions resemble the perfect storm brewing. Now, while it's all calm before that storm, enjoy the last sunny and warm days (and, maybe, it's a good idea to fix some profits, dunno). September and October will be fun. Especially for GME with its negative beta.\n\n*Processing img mcg9etbeh3j71...*\n\n*Processing img xbskfzdkh3j71...*\n\n**TL;DR: My SS thesis and its core idea is more than alive with GME (proven by AMC example), and even though any major price action movement has been suppressed in an attempt to keep things under control by big financial players, the buying pressure is there and it's as strong as it has ever been. The financial system is over-levereged, way more than it was in 2008, and coupled with the industry poor risk assessment standarts ('average WSB retard'-like or worse), it is heading to the next financial crisis (and crashes love autumn). This factor, considering GME's negative beta, will likely trigger the next powerful bull run for GME, sucking in the liquidity from the fearful and already-illiquid markets, resulting in colossal volatility typhoon. Either that, or I'mma be completely bold this winter.**",

I figured I'd be able to just roll them out into higher strike prices and wait for the IV to revert back to the mean, ultimately making a profit. My initial position consisted of 50x 18 Jun 21 $40 Calls at an avg price of  around $2.00. My Reg T margin requirements were around $24K at the time and AMC was around $22 at the time.\n\nOn 5/28/2021 AMC increased by 40% overnight to 36.72 and then dropped to 26.6 intraday, so I rolled out my call options to 9 Jul 21 $50 for a small profit. My Reg T margin requirement was now at 33K, and I had over 200K in my account.\n\non 6/2/2021 AMC increased in price by 27% overnight and was around $41 intraday. I again rolled my calls out for a small profit to 20 AUG 21 $70. My Reg T margin requirement was not at 72K, with enough money in my account to cover.\n\nBut that's when things escalated. The same day, as AMC started to rise to $55 I received two phone calls from an unknown number at noon and a minute later 30 of my contracts were liquidated. During that time, TD had changed their margin requirements to now be at 300% regular rates, and when AMC hit 55, even though my margin requirements would have been 150K, TD wanted me to have over 350K, which I didn't have and was liquidated.\n\nAt around 1pm the initial 30 contracts were liquidated at a premium of $24.5 as opposed to the $2 I originally sold them for, losing me around 66K on that trade. A few hours later, another 10 were liquidated at $35.7 when AMC hit $65, hitting me with another 33K loss. I wish they left a voicemail or at least emailed me, because I didn't hear my phone ring and the liquidation began a minute later. The next day, fearing more margin requirements, I liquidated the rest of the 10 contracts at a $28 premium, when AMC started to drop hitting me with my last loss of around 26K.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Margin Change](https://preview.redd.it/516fwur737g71.png?width=1071&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e42394069c1213db33b52bf40b0f46a8bdfd22f0)\n\nThis was a loss of over 50% of my portfolio and will obviously sting for quiet some time. I hope that sharing this story will help some of you fellow apes avoid this situation. For one, brokers can change margin requirements at any time and liquidate your account whenever, without any notice. I didn't know the full details at the time, as it's the fine print in the terms and condition, and I honestly missed it. I would have took a smaller position and hedged with vertical spreads or bought shares if I knew my margin requirements can jump 3x all of a sudden and totally cripple my account, which honestly just seemed a bit excessive, given that my position was still OTM and I had enough money in my account to cover.\n\nObviously brokers do this to cover themselves in case things get worse and you're not able to cover your losses, but at the same time I'm not sure their risk models properly calculated this increase because at the end, I would have been profitable in my investment and it just ends up hurting the little guy when they cripple your account and buy back your call options at almost a 1600% increase. I doubt they would raise margin rates to such excessive levels without any notice, without any time to respond, if the client is ultra wealthy and would just pull their money out. I wish the little guy would be given the same consideration.\n\nI have actually reached out to some lawyers and filed a FINRA report, but the feedback I have received so far is that brokers are allowed to do whatever they want when margin is involved. Be safe out there apes. If anyone knows if it's worth going to a FINRA arbitration for this to recover some cash, please let me know!\n\n[Timeline of Events](https://preview.redd.it/z933k2fa37g71.png?width=1593&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38473f6c111f56794d6781bf79d283ed76fde683)",

So you've heard CLOV looks good for an epic run... and oh boy does it!**\n\n**I have a full write up broken into multiple parts and I\u2019m spending quite a bit of time on this, I hope you find it useful! If there is any organizational changes I can make to allow reading it easier, please let me know. If you find any piece of information wrong, please point it out but also explain. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time learning about the market since the meme stocks started what they\u2019ve been doing. It\u2019s fascinating, and I\u2019ve learned so much. Lost money, made money, but am overall better for the education! I don\u2019t know everything and I am open to counter arguments and more details where I may have missed some. Thanks!**\n\n***The brief summary of data:*** *CLOV option open interest on 8/20 (the number of contracts open for calls/puts) is absolutely enormous. For perspective, this Friday has a typical number of contracts for the stock. We see 77,006 calls and 31,986 puts (0.42 ratio) expiring, 8/13.*\n\n*FRIDAY 08/20 HOWEVER, we have jaw dropping 306,424 calls, and 72,752 puts (0.24 ratio). This puts us right on track for a GAMMA SQUEEZE (details further down).*\n\n*Earnings report showed a surprise beat on revenue (+100%), critical for growth stocks. We are at a local minimum value on the stock, so with a great earnings report, investors are eager to buy the stock. We saw this on 08/12 after earnings with the insane amount of volume (147.4million, vs the avg. of 29.22 million) fighting for the price around $9 a share.*\n\n*These factors, plus 25% short interest (who doesn't love hearing that), mean that CLOV is ripe for a major mind melting squeeze beginning the week of the Futures contract rollover dates beginning on the Futures First Notice Day, August 26. The futures contracts are a key piece of this meme stock puzzle that many have been trying to solve.*\n\n*This will likely peak before Sept. 9 due to futures rollover dates. Unless we see insane price action reaching margin call levels, which considering the DTCC's updated Uncleared Margin Rules (phase 5) going into effect on Sept 1st. is expected to cause a spike in margin calls.*\n\n***TLDR: CLOV go moon before Sept 9, buy shares. Buy calls 09/03 @ $10 and 9/10 @ whatever strike suits you.***\n\nFor the long version, read on!\n\n**Table of Contents:**\n\n1. What the hell is a gamma squeeze?\n2. How will we recognize a gamma squeeze? How long can it take to play out?\n3. FTDS\n4. **Futures Contracts Rollover Dates \u2013  Triple Witching Rollover Edition and we're in a Ford Bronco**\n\n***What the hell is a gamma squeeze and how do you predict one is going to happen?***\n\nA gamma squeeze is a product of the derivatives (calls/puts) market. Usually this is a rare event, but with growing accessibility to the markets by retail investors, it is becoming more common. (*Tin foil hat*: this will not last forever, they will nerf this feature at some point).\n\n***What causes the gamma squeeze?*** Unusually high call option open interest + Rise in share price + Market Maker Delta hedging.\n\nDelta hedging is when market makers buy and sell shares in a stock to remain delta neutral. See, a Hedge fund (market maker) is intended to provide liquidity, and help you buy and sell shares. But they don't want to be on the bad side of a trade, so they remain delta neutral.\n\nDelta is a value that affects the option price on calls and puts. It is directly related to the rate of change in stock price. So if you have a call option with a delta of 0.1, a market maker needs to buy 10 shares to hedge. A delta of 0.5 would be 50 shares, and the max delta is 1.0 or 100 shares (this would be deep in the money) The more call options open (open interest), the more market makers have to do this.\n\nAs you might be figuring out, if the market makers have to buy shares to delta hedge, and there are an immense amount of call options open, then the buying action from market makers to delta hedge can and WILL drive up the price. As retail investors continue to buy shares and the price climbs, market makers must also buy shares to delta hedge. This causes a snowballing effect called the gamma squeeze. We saw this happen with so many stocks now (AMC in June, CLOV in June).\n\nGamma is the value that measures the rate of change in delta. So the faster the price changes, the higher the delta, and gamma runs higher as delta changes faster. Hence why it is termed a gamma squeeze.\n\n***How will we recognize a gamma squeeze happening? How long can it take to play out?***\n\nThe timeline for a gamma squeeze can be longer than you think. It is driven by multiple factors, and the intensity of each of these factors adds pressure to the overall squeeze. It can be broken into a few parts:\n\n***Share buying***\n\nAs shares are bought causing a rise in the stock price, market makers must hedge by buying shares as delta rises. The faster the rise in stock price due to buying pressure, the faster delta increases and the more shares need to be purchased by market makers. This is due to the need to deliver these shares the following week as more calls become in the money. More on this below.\n\n***Call Buying***\n\nThe more calls bought, the more shares must be purchased to delta hedge. If I purchase the $8 strike for 08/20 expiration, that call has a delta right now of 0.6. This means the market maker will purchase 60 shares to hedge against this.\n\nIn one respect, I think you can view buying calls as a way to effectively move the market as though you purchased that many shares, for a fraction of the price \u2013 hence the fact it is a leveraged bet. The current value of the call option is $59, however it would cost you $492.6 to buy $60 shares to have the same effect. (That said, please do not just YOLO call options, I\u2019m doing a mix of calls and shares).\n\n***Call Options Expiring ITM and their delivery***\n\nThe more calls that expire ITM on Friday, the more this impacts the price of the stock the following week. If you weren\u2019t aware, options expiring ITM must have their shares delivered to the exerciser of the contract by T+2. If the call writer is short the stock, they must buy the stock on the market. As a result, we usually see a surge in stock price following options expiration if a large number of calls expire ITM. This surge in stock price causes a surge in delta, which further compounds the rise in price as market makers buy shares to hedge delta. It\u2019s this T+2 option delivery, combined with futures rollover dates, that I believe is going to help catalyze the next run.\n\nIn the case of CLOV, there are absolutely staggering numbers of calls at various strikes on 08/20. See the following table from Barchart to see the numbers yourself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Open Interest on 08\\/20 for CLOV strikes $1-$17.50](https://preview.redd.it/2z331r8mjqh71.jpg?width=1160&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=124414fbc8a6314411691481a022d9df3185cfac)\n\n***Closing Short Sales***\n\nAs share price increases and borrowable shares dwindle, the borrow fee for short positions rises. Eventually this becomes untenable for short sellers and they must purchase shares to close their positions. We\u2019ve beaten the short squeeze scenario to death in this subreddit, so I won\u2019t go into more details. Just for data, the most recently reported (08/10) short interest on fintel shows 22.48% of the float is short, though Ortex estimates this has increased as of Friday 08/13 to 25.58% (go figure after that price action we saw on Friday). Short sales have likely been used to suppress price prior to the massive buy up necessary due to futures contracts (see below).\n\n***FTDS \u2013 Failures-to-deliver***\n\nCLOV shares that failed to deliver in the first two weeks of July is a staggering number. There were 46 million shares that failed to deliver. Compare to the 22million in June, vs the 6 million in May. These shares must be delivered. FTD data for the second half of July should be available on 08/16.\n\n46 million shares out of the public float of 133.76 million = 34.3% of the entire stocks\u2019 float failed to deliver in the first two weeks of July.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[FTDs for CLOV. Massive Spike in early July during the consistent drop in stock value](https://preview.redd.it/jo34i1g2kqh71.jpg?width=1830&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4433d9ee3994dcbd16e6ac84951894a8fa099204)\n\nHigh number of shares that fail to deliver usually indicates high amounts of short selling. Additionally, after the 30th of June, it appears that skyrocketing FTDs is correlated to a consistently falling share price that sees no Tuesday recovery due to options delivery. You can see a spike each Tuesday in June due to this, followed by a drop in share value.\n\n***READ! Futures Contracts Rollover \u2013 THIS IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL!***\n\nFor me, this was the last piece of the puzzle on figuring out what is going on with the meme stocks. The Triple Witching day is well known, and happens when futures expiration meets quarterly option expirations, but the timeframe for equity rollover was completely unknown to me.\n\nOn 9/9 the next futures contract rollover date happens. There is evidence that much of the meme stock activity is due to someone on the bad end of a futures basket that included many of the \"meme\" stocks we love so much today.\n\nEach major run up has been just before the futures rollover date on many more stocks than CLOV. Some of those companies show movies, other sell stuff to gamers. I don\u2019t want to name them and get flagged for removal.\n\nThe last futures rollover date was 6/10, the week that was the peak of our last meme circus. CLOV\u2019s peak was seen on 6/9, and the futures rollover happened the following day. CLOV stock never recovered.\n\nFurthermore, if you look at the following table I stole from /u/criand without permission (the futures info is his DD, thanks dude, you\u2019re a fucking hero)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0qtzon9pjqh71.png?width=679&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c066103e8c7bf7ea71274f397bb33a7d57923dfc\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Critical dates in the June 2nd - June 9th Squeeze](https://preview.redd.it/mllu0qaqjqh71.png?width=1547&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6da4572dbed718075d9ad28ebce7b9b195f6bb90)\n\nWe can see that the beginning of rollovers started on May 25th, the same day we started to see CLOV climb up from $7.01/share. The following week it closed on Friday, 6/4 at $9.12/share\n\nThe next Monday 06/7, it rips up to $11.92 by close, followed by a run to a close of $22.15 on Tuesday the 06/08. Wednesday 06/09 saw a high of $28.85 and a close of $16.92, ending the squeeze. You may ask yourself why it took so long for it to run up like this? The objective is to cover at the very last minute and avoid retail traders piling on to make the problem worse. If retail traders were to push the value of the stock higher each week allowing more calls to end ITM, through the buying of shares and ITM and ATM call options, then this run will end up moving sooner and moving higher. This is the exact scenario they want to avoid, and why you have never heard this information until now.\n\n**What to look for in confirmation?**\n\nMarket maker algorithms generally move prices to max-pain. This is where option writers are hurt the most and the least impact is placed on the market maker. When we end above the max pain level (which for 08/20 is $9.00) it puts more calls ITM, which usually leads to increased price action the following week as shares are bought to deliver for options contracts.\n\nIf it closes over $9 a share this Friday, that puts an additional 20,952 call options ITM. If we go over $10, this adds another 32,382 calls ITM. The more shares purchased this week by retail, plus the more AT THE MONEY AND IN THE MONEY CALLS will put pressure on this gamma squeeze to get started. The higher the price ends this Friday, the higher this event goes.\n\n**How to cause the most impact on the stock price:**\n\nIf you plan to participate, I suggest buying shares and ITM or ATM call options. One method of acquiring shares is buying a call option. If you by a call option for 8/20, the $8 strike is $59. The current share price is $8.21. If you purchase the option and choose to exercise it, you can have the effect of the call\u2019s delta forcing market makers to buy shares to hedge, plus when you exercise you can acquire 100 shares and force a higher price on Tuesday during options delivery.\n\nMy strategy involves deep ITM calls this week which I will exercise on Friday. I have the $6 strike call which will allow me to call away 100 shares for $6 each. I chose this as the shares did manage to reach $7.01 in May before the run, and I want to make sure I don\u2019t end up OTM. I also have the 09/03 call for the $10 strike, and the 09/10 call for the $11 strike. I do not plan to exercise these calls, and instead sell them during a bullish run up during their week of expiration.\n\nGood luck, have fun, and set yourself up to get out of this 9-5 bullshit, we deserve better!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll leave you with one last bullish bit of sentiment, straight from the DTCC:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vl3d8cwsjqh71.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b818ae75767a341f2512a2324ddc68455eb0ae72",

        "selftext": "What's up Apes,\n\nLet's have a quick look at AMC and some possible scenarios for next week.\n\nTLDR at the bottom.\n\nThe sell off has considerably slowed down in the last month, and the price has been mostly consolidating between 30 and 40 usd. Better than expected results for the third quarter, and some news announced in the earnings call on the 9th of august have led to a considerable price increase and gap up , which was quickly met with strong selling back down to support. From there, price has once again formed a double bottom and was mostly up in the following 4 or 5 trading days.\n\nOverall, volatility and volume are down, which is good news for the bulls, because it indicates that the bears have lost some steam.\n\nLet's have a look at the technicals.  \n\n\n**Price Action**\n\nPrice is currently trading inside two wedge patterns, a small and a big one, indicated in the chart below with red and blue trend lines. If price breaks the upper red line, a rally and a test of the upper resistance of the big wedge (40usd) is likely. If it bounces off that resistance, I expect price to retest the lower red support again (30usd). A break and daily close above 40 would indicate forther upside (target 50 usd), while a break and daily close below would indicate further downside (target 25 usd)\n\n*Processing img 8stlrwfxcih71...*\n\n**MACD**\n\nThe daily MACD has turned green for the first time since june. The moving averages are crossing. Overall the MACD suggest the momentum is shifting to the upside.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fo3h65p1fih71.png?width=1461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e42dc446a8e257ed4d9374ce73caba5931f07238\n\n**RSI**\n\nThere is a bullish divergence in the RSI (Matching RSI lows while second price low was lower than the first), as well as a double bottom. Overall, the RSI indicates a decreasing bearish momentum and suggests that a (at least temporary) bottom might be in.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t6qpc4qofih71.png?width=1449&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42a43da79a122bfc655267ab28bb2ce7a7593b9f\n\n**TLDR - Points of interest**\n\nLong Positions: I am looking for an entry around 30 USD if price falls down there again. I am also looking for a break of the upper red resistance for a rally to 40. If 40 breaks, I am looking at 50.\n\nShort Positions: I am looking at a bounce either off the upper red resistance back to 30, or if that resistance breaks, a bounce off the upper blue resistance back to either the upper red trendline, or if that breaks, 30 usd. However, bears should be careful. Price is down quite a lot, never chase.  \n\n\nGodspeed retards",

Since 90%+ of my portfolio is tied up in a play, I didn\u2019t plan on posting anything until after. However, some [SKIN calls recently paid off](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p3oz2a/skin_side_bet_gains_4k_34k_all_shit_calls/) and now I have money now for a side bet. So I\u2019m going to introduce a stock that caught my eye. But, before I begin I want you all to watch this education video on how Hedge\u2019s take your money:\n\n[The Barclays Trading Strategy that Outperforms the Market](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pYgz4YlQnE)\n\nSince I didn\u2019t release anything on NEGG until the [last second](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofojpw/whats_going_on_with_negg_a_ticker_with_35m_float/), and didn\u2019t have the time to write up a DD on SKIN before [the moon](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p3oz2a/skin_side_bet_gains_4k_34k_all_shit_calls/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), I wanted to change it up and inject some new blood into the pool. I have a theory that a lot of stocks on this sub are built on the backs of bagholders, so anytime I post a DD I want to make sure the setup is especially juicy and the calls cheap. Loss porn is cool and all, but it's depressing - I\u2019m looking at you [UPST bro](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p3mhc0/upst_crash_update_how_to_lose_150k_in_3_days/), [I warned your ass to chill](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p1wt77/betting_80k_on_upst_crash_after_earnings/h8hug6f?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). \n\nThis isn\u2019t CLOV, AMC, WKHS, CLNE \u2014 **this is PAYA** a stock with juicy profit margins, crazy revenue growth, and an asymmetric gain opportunity in the short term because calls are cheap, with whales already jumping in slapping big dick energy down on OTM calls. \n\nEerily, this stock has not been mentioned on reddit or any of the regular places I check for mentions, even though they 1) [murked earnings and raised guidance](https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/21/08/22370953/paya-holdings-clocks-25-revenue-growth-in-q2-lifts-fy21-gross-margin-outlook), 2) [analysts keep upgrading their PTs](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/PAYA/price-target/), 3) [announced on Friday a cashless redemption catalyst on Sep 10](https://investors.paya.com/news-releases/news-release-details/paya-holdings-inc-announces-commencement-exchange-offer-and), and 4) institutions are loaded to the tits with shares **(118%+)**\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n**This institutional share anomaly** will be deep dived later - but surprise surprise, since the institutions who **own all the shares are investment management firms who generally** buy and hold, the float is illiquid. Since, without an actively traded float there is essentially no float. Lastly as always there is a short angle for extra salt.\n\nWhen you read this DD remember the video I posted; people are watching  [\ud83d\udc40](https://emojipedia.org/eyes/), so take profits this time and cut your losses if you FOMO in at the last second. I wouldn\u2019t be posting or throwing money down on calls unless I had a good amount of conviction that this pays out.\n\n**Here\u2019s the tldr summary for what\u2019s up**\n\n* **Solid financials.** Ex: 52% gross profit margins (Square is 28%) \n* **Near-100% institutional holdings** (equals highly restricted float)\n* **Major warrant dilution cancellation** catalyst (Sep 10)\n* **Multiple** **major valuations** at a 60% upside. \n* **IV is dirt poor** at 40% . \n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n# Part 1 About + Financials \n\nPAYA is a payment processor that has done close to $35bn in payments in 2020, projected $40bn in 2021 and is growing at a fast pace. They work through vendors, resellers, independent sales organizations, developers, etc, etc, etc., and have a bunch of different offerings depending on the sector of business, while their projected upward revenue is intense.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nPaya has the lowest price per sales of all its competitors at 5.0 (SHOP is at 48.67 and INTU at 16.51). Gross profit margins are insane at 50.9%, compared to 23.2% for Square (SQ), and 48.4% of Paypal (PYPL). In fact, PAYA has the highest Institutional ownership of all competitors and the highest short interest. \n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nCaption: competitors analyzed: SQ, PYPL, INTU, SHOP, FISV, PSFE\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to deep dive into, but it\u2019s solid company. So solid that institutions are picking up as many shares of PAYA as possible. [Their recent Q2 ER presentation](https://investors.paya.com/static-files/3769846b-2d2c-4e7a-946f-5b25b6911e93) showed off their stellar earnings growth. It\u2019s hard to name other companies with permanent relevancy that have **over a 50% gross profit margin**. \n\nCouple highlights\n\n* $135mil of cash on hand\n* $244mil revenue expected in 2021\n* 25% revenue growth year-over-year realized and projected\n* 42% gross profit margin growth year-over-year realized and projected\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nSince the economy has reopened, PAYA\u2019s profit margins have only been growing. Unlike most tech companies, they are not a one-and-done situation but will have permanent relevancy in the post-Covid world. In fact, they are a top-20 payment provider in the US. \n\n[BTIG](https://www.investing.com/news/btig-stick-to-their-buy-rating-for-paya-holdings-2439931), [Truist](https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/06/21740210/truist-securities-initiates-coverage-on-paya-holdings-with-buy-rating-announces-price-target-of-15), [Cannacord](https://m.investing.com/news/canaccord-genuity-stick-to-their-buy-rating-for-paya-holdings-2344676), and [Credit Suisse](https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/05/20983489/credit-suisse-initiates-coverage-on-paya-holdings-with-outperform-rating-announces-price-target-of-1) have all given PAYA bullish targets with an average 56% upside. Meanwhile, institutions have just been pouring into this stock and buying more while increasing price targets. \n\n# Part 2 Institutional Holdings: +128% \n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nOkay, so this is getting good. So institutions obviously can\u2019t hold more than 100% of shares - this is probably a small error in delayed reporting and maybe some brokers miscounting a handful of tranche locked up shares. \n\n**However** **it is very likely that institutions hold near-100% of all shares**. The entire volume over the last 6 weeks since Q2 reporting was only 28 million shares. The largest holder, GTCR didn\u2019t sell a share, Blackrock bought 150% more, and every single other major institution holder that reported for Q2 so far **increased** their positions.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nWhat does this mean? It means that institutions and funds think this is a valuable AF company and they are holding nearly all outstanding shares. They are jacked. **And remember: if nearly all outstanding shares are being held by institutions**, **that means the effective float is tiny**. This is very important in relation to short interest**.** \n\nFiguring out just how small the float is relevant to figuring out what kind of corner shorts have put themselves in. Luckily we have some good pieces of info to guide us-\n\n* [PAYA tells us](https://investors.paya.com/static-files/3769846b-2d2c-4e7a-946f-5b25b6911e93#page=10) there are 121mil shares outstanding in their recent ER. \n* [13Fs/Ds tell us](https://fintel.io/so/us/paya) that most institutions are holding and only small funds are trading in and out. \n* [FINRA tells us](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/paya/short-interest) that ***there are 7.2mil outstanding S***I. \n* [Price tells us](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-PAYA/) that only 28mil shares were traded in the last 6 weeks since June 30 Q2 reports have been filed with only a net 2.1mil share sell.\n\n**If nearly all shares are held by institutions,** then obviously the float is highly restricted. Since we know the exact number of shorts via FINRA, we can figure out real short interest in relation to the float at different institutional holding levels.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nAfter all my time in highly illiquid stocks like NEGG and others that can\u2019t be named, it\u2019s obvious PAYA\u2019s float is super tight, and it seems pretty plausible institutional holdings are likely around the 90% range, if not higher. **This would correlate to a 60%-118% short percentage of the effective float.**\n\nAdditionally, from the FTD viewpoint you see a spike in [FTDs with the price bleeding up](https://sec.report/fails.php?tc=paya). To me this indicates tight short constraints, and combining with what we already know leads me to the belief that there may be a supply issue. SI doesn\u2019t have to be balls to the wall for it to matter, sometimes supply-side issues are there but not reflected in the raw SI data. \n\nI guarantee these shorts don\u2019t realize that their positions are ticking time bombs due to the illiquid nature of the stock. They probably don\u2019t even have a fundamentally negative view of the company and are just actively trading in and out of the stock. Spoiler: it won\u2019t end well \n\n# Part 3 Canceled. Warrant dilution\n\nA lot of negative price sentiment came from market pricing in an 18mil eventual share dilution via warrant exercises. This would have been a -**15% share dilution** of current shareholders.\n\n[Surprise](https://investors.paya.com/news-releases/news-release-details/paya-holdings-inc-announces-commencement-exchange-offer-and). \n\nTurns out PAYA is doing well enough that they are **forgoing $200 million** to protect share value by buying back their warrants. This is pending a vote due on Sep 10 where they already have 63.5% of \u201cyes\u201d votes. \n\nFor those unfamiliar with the process here, I\u2019ll explain. Since PAYA was originally a SPAC, it has warrants. A warrant is basically a call option with a strike price of $11.50 and a 5 year term. [As stated in their S1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001819881/000121390020035622/fs12020_payaholdings.htm), PAYA originally issued 17.7mil warrants (which would eventually dilute into the stock), however last week [they dropped the news](https://investors.paya.com/news-releases/news-release-details/paya-holdings-inc-announces-commencement-exchange-offer-and) that they would be calling for a \u201ccashless redemption\u201d of the warrants at a ratio of .26 shares per warrant, and changing the dilution from the long established 17.7mil to 4.6mil. \n\nThis is bullish because \n\n1. PAYA is saying they don\u2019t need the cash (the 17.7mil warrants exercised would have brought them $204mil) \n2. Instead of the float being diluted by 17.7mil shares, there will now be only 4.6mil shares issued. **This is a positive change of +11% which the market has not priced in.**\n3. The warrants don\u2019t have an upward cap, and can be bought as high as wanted in relation to the stock.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n# Part 4 The Short and Long Play\n\n**Fair value is** **at least $16.65** based on analyst coverage, warrant cashless redemption, and fundamental growth profit margins [growing at 42% YoY](https://investors.paya.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/10-q/0001819881-21-000035). They provide services that are growing exponentially and will remain in high demand for decades + their stock has received a ridiculous number of valuations all 46% higher than current valuation **before the warrant redemption news hit**. \n\nThere is still an immediate need for the market to react to the warrant redemption. Upside is at least 11% - from current $10.21 to $11.33 just on the news Friday alone (PSA - the options market has not priced this in at all yet) not even factoring in their massive revenue guidance, short coverings, or other catalysts they have lined up.\n\n**9/20 10c @ .60 = 733% returns at $11.33 by Sep 10** \n\n**9/20 12.5c @ .10 = 2400% returns at $15 by Sep 10**\n\n**11/15 15c @ .15 = 1800% returns at $17.5 in October**\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n# Part 5 Options Flow\n\n1K+ Flow \n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n# Part 6 Position\n\n\ud83d\udcf7",

I know what you're thinking: welp, missed the boat on another one. And yes everyone, I'm the guy who posted the [10k earnings FD Yolo](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oxalfx/preearnings_10k_viac_fd_yolo/) couple days ago (sold those today and rolled them into LEAPS). Today was a GOOD day - aside from forgetting to screenshot BEFORE I sold for once in my damn life, typically I do the opposite and then never actually sell and lose all of it.\n\nBut this party is literally just getting started.\n\nOn Monday, Discovery (DISCA) [drilled](https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Discovery-Q2-Earnings-Snapshot-16359685.php) to the center of the earth off of strong earnings but dismal growth numbers, **falling 6%** and taking Viacom (which trades similarly to Discovery) along with it on the ride down. Ever since the Archegos collapse (more on that later but all of you know the Bull Hwang story by now), algos have undeservedly tied these two tickers at the hip. Subtract that undeserved 6% from today's 7% gain, and it pretty much cancels out: VIAC is **basically only up 1% off** of a truly fantastic earnings report. In fact, this stock was literally higher as recently as a week ago - and that's when earnings were a huge question mark, but no longer. For once, fellow apes would be getting in on the **GROUND FLOOR**.\n\n**Q2 Earnings Highlights** (Don't feel compelled to read this part if you don't want to, TL;DR: they knocked it out of the park)\n\n* Revenue: 6.56B (est 6.52B)\n* Adj EPS: 0.97 (est 0.96)\n* \\+6.5M streaming subscribers (42M total between P+, Showtime etc)\n* \\+2.8M PlutoTV MAUs (52.3M total)\n* \\+45% watch time per user  (Roku's decreased)\n* \\+24% ad revenue yoy\n* \\+9% affiliate revenue yoy\n* \\+92% (!) streaming revenue yoy\n* Paramount+ [officially launched in Europe](https://variety.com/2021/streaming/global/viacomcbs-sky-paramount-plus-europe-launch-1235035254/), expands in South America\n* In this market you really need to pitch a perfect game to not get sold off on earnings. This was a clean sweep across the board: Viacom, priced like a value stock, just blew out all the growth stocks in growth metrics (looking at you Roku). And the best is yet to come (more on this later)\n\nOk let's review what Viacom even does for those who don't know. If you do know, skip this next part.\n\n**1.** **The Business**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[If you haven't watched something made by one of these brands there's just simply no way you live in America. ](https://preview.redd.it/k1j6my9sxmf71.png?width=665&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69242a8e76eea2ce69f669d9d46ead5a9c0988cb)\n\nViacom basically owns every single TV channel you retards grew up watching. Nickelodeon, MTV, VH1, Comedy Central - from our childhood cartoons at Nickelodeon to the greatest comedy sketch show of all time (Chapelle's Show - no debate) to the shitty reality shows of the 2000's (Jersey Shore): Viacom owns ALL of it. It also owns Showtime which makes Billions, the unofficial TV show of WSB.\n\nIn a day and age where streaming content is at a premium, Viacom is sitting on an absolute TREASURE CHEST of content.\n\n**How They Make Money**\n\n* Advertising - Good old fashioned TV ads during programming (both traditional and streaming)\n* Affiliate - The cut Viacom gets from the boomer retards who still pay their provider for cable TV\n* Streaming Subscriptions - the 5 or 10 dollars a month from Paramount+ / Showtime\n* Theatrical Releases - Did you know a Quiet Place 2 (made by Paramount) is the third highest grossing movie of the year behind Fast 9 and Black Widow? And cost a fraction of those to make? But yes, people still buy tickets to see movies (just ask the AMC apes, they know what's up).\n* Licensing - Viacom doesn't keep all the content they make, they also license it out to others for LOTS of money. Much like a pimp that whores out prostitutes instead of keeping them all for his own sexual desires, VIAC is all about licensing money. HBO paid them half a BILLION for South Park. Amazon paid them 150 million for Coming 2 America, one of the shittiest sequels to a classic of all time. And as Netflix, Amazon, Apple all fight for content, fees are only going to go up. And all that money goes right back into fueling Viacom's sleeping giant: Paramount+\n\n**Paramount Plus**\n\nEven total retards know that traditional TV as we know is dying. Gone are the days where the whole family gathers around the tube to watch Modern Family at 9pm - these days everyone is on their own schedule, they mostly get their shows through streaming apps when they want it. More and more families are cutting the cable cord, opting instead to go with streaming apps like Netflix, Disney+, Amazon - with varying degrees of success. Streaming is the future - nothing new here.\n\nParamount+ is the brand spanking new streaming app that Viacom is banking on to contend with the big boys. The market has basically valued this venture at fucking zero - and you know what that was somewhat understandable: it's a crowded industry, the app hadn't existed for even a full quarter yet, the street wanted to take a \"wait and see\" approach.\n\nWelp, Paramount just blew the fucking doors off all projections for their first full quarter and put to rest any doubts about the viability of the app. Between Paramount (and premium cable sister app Showtime), Viacom now has 42 million users, up from 36 when they last reported. And the biggest catalysts for growth are still yet to come!\n\nAnyways, back to live TV's alleged slow death. There is one MAJOR exception to this. Sports. While we can catch our Billions episode on Tuesday night because we missed it Sunday and have basically the same experience, there is nothing more useless than a rerun of a sporting event. We need that shit LIVE, and it's basically the only kind of TV that has to be.\n\n**Are you ready for some football?**\n\nDid you know that the NFL accounted for 71 of the top 100 most watched live broadcasts in 2020? That's almost 75 fucking percent! In fact the NFL was responsible for $4 billion+ ad revenue for host networks in 2020 - and guess who just extended their NFL deal? When fall rolls around, P+ signups are going to fucking FLY as the CBS team broadcasts every AFC matchup this year, conveniently located in some top TV markets - Kansas City, Buffalo, Pittsburgh, and New England are all AFC / ViacomCBS territory, and all happy to look pretty decent this year unlike NFC teams New Orleans, Atlanta, and Chicago (but i'll save this convo for r/NFL).\n\nOh yeah, ViacomCBS also has the SEC college football rights too, the only conference in college football that even matters these days. American Football not your thing? They got the rights to real futbol too, including UEFA Champions league soccer and Serie A. More of a hoops guy? Guess who has the exclusive rights to March Madness. More of a boomer? Guess who has the PGA Tour.\n\nWith over 1000 live sporting events a year, Paramount Plus may actually be the most complete sports streaming app out there, surpassing even ESPN.\n\n**Boomers still watch TV**\n\nIf you're reading this, take a moment to wipe the jizz off your pants from Viacom's sporting dominance as we review their more traditional businesses and check out some of these stats.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Wait, you mean to tell me ONE company has the top THREE dramas, top SIX comedies, #1 news show, and the #1 most watched show in the country on TOP of the NFL, SEC, PGA, NCAA, and soccer?! Even if you're not big on this stuff, you have to recognize how impressive that is. I for one don't watch a single one of these shows, but I know a lot of middle America \\/ boomer generation absolutely still live by this shit. They aren't going away any time soon, as much as we might want them to. ](https://preview.redd.it/c32ujr09umf71.png?width=444&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9170cca3860c60b53f42980660de08668eabc63e)\n\nDon't believe this? Check out [Variety's report from May](https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/most-popular-tv-shows-highest-rated-2020-2021-season-1234980743/) about the most-watched TV shows on TV. Sheer CBS DOMINANCE.  \n\n[I'm assuming none of us watch any of these shows anymore unless it's to find new memes for WSB, but we all have a son \\/ daugher \\/ stepson as product of cuckery \\/ sibling who is right in the Spongebob \\/ Paw Patrol \\/ Peppa Pig age range. No one, not even Disney, controls THIS much essential IP for the children's market. For parents, Paramount+ isn't a luxury, it's an absolute NECESSITY to shut their kids up.  ](https://preview.redd.it/45mxntowumf71.png?width=641&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eaca6e55ff23254f30066b0c035aac5eaf949465)\n\nThe order isn't specified, but out of the [most popular children's television shows in America](https://www.fatherly.com/play/most-popular-kids-shows/), Viacom through Nickelodeon produces the vast majority of them. \n\nAlright, enough about Paramount Plus. It's the key to VIAC's future, but we've covered enough of it. As P+ slowly begins to claim back it's IP it's licensed out to other streamers to bolster its own library and starts churning out some seriously great P+ exclusives (THE NEW [HALO](https://deadline.com/2021/02/halo-tv-series-latest-paramount-plus-move-1234698703/) TV SHOW for example) reasons to get the app will become more and more compelling over time - for sports fans, boomers, and parents especially. But what about for the poor people who don't want to pay even one penny for TV?\n\n**Pluto TV**\n\nLet me start this off by saying this: if you don't have Pluto TV, download that shit right now because it's free. Literally zero strings attached fucking free, don't even need to make an account with a fake email address, it's F R E E freeeeee. Whether or not you buy the stock, if you wasted all this time reading through all of this you will have at least gained the knowledge of the single greatest free cord cutting app ever invented.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v187qgwyvmf71.png?width=1260&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55c2638210fbbfa7b1f2268e90dced25e9570566\n\nBut how does Viacom make any money by giving you hundreds of channels and not charging you? You guessed it: ads. This nifty free app is expected to generate [1 BILLION](https://deadline.com/2021/08/pluto-tv-reaches-1-billion-annual-revenue-milestone-streaming-advertising-1234809600/) in advertising revenue for Pluto in 2021, well ahead of schedule. I have this on 8 hours a day in the background because BloombergTV is included, and it's absolutely fucking amazing. CBSHQ is a great ESPN replacement too for the sports fans that can no longer tolerate the irritating sounds of Stephen A Smith. Check it out, it's sweet. And free, you cheap fucks.\n\n***TL;DR: Viacom is one of the most complete streaming TV stocks you can own right now, with something for everyone and strong competitive advantages in children's programming, live sports, and boomer television shows. It's the past, the present, and the future. They are taking the enormous cash flows that still continue to be generated from their linear TV business and investing the profits into the future of television: streaming - they're eating their cake and keeping it too.*** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. **The Competitors (If you know the streaming space intimately, skip this part too)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Contrary to popular belief, the SVOD pie is still growing even as we come out of the pandemic, and Viacom's share \\(through Showtime and Paramount+, one of the only apps above to actually GAIN market share TWO straight quarters\\) is expanding as well. Notice the 4&amp;#37; DECLINE from Netflix between Q4 and Q2 2021 while Hulu and Disney have actually SHRANK as well. Time for a new sheriff in town?](https://preview.redd.it/uozq7ze0wmf71.png?width=564&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6650e06867cfa58da7fee6c24c52cf5cb6492022)\n\n**Netflix**\n\nThose of you who thought Netflix runs this shit like Don Corleone are severely mistaken. While an early entrant and pioneer in the streaming space, growth has been hard to come by for Netflix thanks to a declining library, a refusal to compete in live sports or news programs, and more recently, a truly [bizarre foray into mobile gaming](https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585802/netflix-gaming-mobile-subscription-earnings). As you can see, Netflix, while still #1, is in decline - as the most expensive app, they seem to be coasting more on the Netflix brand name. And on the off chance they make a show someone actually likes, it's probably [canceled](https://www.businessinsider.com/best-canceled-netflix-shows-one-day-at-a-time-daredevil-2019-6).\n\n**HBO + Discovery**\n\nYou're probably most familiar with HBO as the channel that fucked up Game of Thrones beyond repair, rendering a once global cultural phenomenon to being completely wiped out from the entire pop-culture consciousness. Discovery makes all the dogshit reality TV such as 90 Day Fiancee that is tearing down the fabric of American society. Other assets include TNT (home of Charles Barkley and I really don't know what else) and CNN (the world's leading purveyor of fake news).\n\nWelp, they're all joining together. As of [May 17th](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/17/att-to-combine-warnermedia-and-discovery-assets-to-create-a-new-standalone-company.html), Discovery is merging with WarnerMedia - a deal structured so poorly that it sent Discovery shares from the $41 it was at premarket that day down to a paltry $29.20 today. Not all mergers are created equal, and this [reverse morris trust merger](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reverse-morris-trust.asp) successfully transferred AT&amp;T's HBO bags to unsuspecting Discovery shareholders, resulting in a debt-ridden entity that hopes to compete in the very long run. \n\nI'm not going to bash Discovery too much because I do think it has a chance to be relevant down the line, but this merger isn't closing for a WHILE and there's just not a whole lot of upside for the stock in the short term. The potential of being acquired is now gone. \n\n**Disney**\n\nDisney has deep pockets, and Disney+ combined with Hulu and ESPN is a strong portfolio. Their dual theatrical release + Disney+ streaming release combo business model is also used by Paramount, and may prove to be the standard moving forward. Disney+ has two of the world's most valuable IP of all time in Marvel and Star Wars, so you won't catch me talking shit about them here. They're a strong player here, and is the only one that could challenge Viacom's supremacy in children's content (although IMO Paramount targets the 5+ demographic while Disney is more in the 13+ space). Then again, Disney isn't a pure play streaming stock either (Disney World, Disney Land) so it's not a perfect comparison.\n\n**Amazon / Apple**\n\nBoth of these FAANG stalwarts have made half assed efforts to compete in the streaming space without really dedicating any sort of resources to it since they have so much other shit going on. Bezos at least pretended to care for a while, showing up to the Emmy awards and shit before getting bored and fucking off to space. Apple's AppleTV effort has been dismal to say the least, with a content library of around 50 titles and a userbase composed almost entirely of free trials that won't be renewed. More on this later.\n\n**NBC / Peacock**The only reason to have this shit app is for Office re-runs when you invite a girl over to Netflix and Chill. Ironically Netflix actually lost the Office to its original maker (just another L in a long series of NFLX L's) but Peacock and Chill does have a better ring to it anyways. Otherwise, this app is basically useless and is the least likely to survive the streaming wars independently without some sort of merger. Which brings me to my next point.\n\n**ROKU -** only a competitor to PlutoTV, not really a competitor to Paramount+. Have you seen their P/E multiple? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Ok, I compiled the above myself and did my best to update through this quarter's ER's. It may not be ENTIRELY up to date or accurate, but I did the best I could since as far as I could tell there was nowhere else on the internet that had this info all in one place, I looked everywhere. Does not include Pluto TV, Tubi, Roku, or any of the free ad-based apps. ](https://preview.redd.it/hy2nnltqzmf71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fdd1116b95dad14ad5388422ae22b3cb28d531db)\n\n**VALUATION**\n\nOk, let's talk numbers, without which this is just paragraphs of drivel that no one is going to fucking read. If you apes made it this far by the way, I salute you. Here's where it gets fun. The below is sourced from a Google sheets template I built from scatch, sourcing from Google Finance and Finviz. I'll point out what I thought was noteworthy from each screen, but feel free to draw your own conclusions. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Check out that 52 week high column for Viacom and Discovery vs. where they are now.

While these numbers are terrible, you'll see they pretty much suck across the entire sector \\(check out the SMA stats on the streaming ETF\\). It's a downtime for the streaming sector coming out of the pandemic with money flowing towards reopening plays, while high growth tech has been mooning thanks to a second collapse of the 10 year yield. I expect this entire sector to recover H2 2021 via sector rotation back into communications when the 10 year yield goes back up \\(it's projected to double by year end\\). ](https://preview.redd.it/f6nictey1nf71.png?width=958&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5770c797fbc24c8ffda3967c96ae80b07d7273b0)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The important thing to note here is institutional onwership aka \\\\\"the smart money\\\\\".

Even compared to its peers in traditional TV, this is ludicrously low. Why should FOXA be higher despite not having a paid streaming app?

I'm not arguing that VIAC should be anywhere near those P\\/E's, but with everything it has going for it, 9 is ludicrous. You're not going to find better-hidden value than this ANYWHERE in the S&amp;P 500. Run a screen and sort by P\\/E if you don't believe me.](https://preview.redd.it/e8jgc35v4nf71.png?width=1368&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1daf37f3492e539bb9db61202d35f5d26776bcbe)\n\n**3. ARCHEGOS aka Bull Hwang gets Margin Called (Skip if you know the history)**\n\nI don't want to spend too much time on this story because all of WSB knows it for the most part. Legendary fund manager Bill Hwang blew up his account in a matter of days in true WSB fashion by being levered 20 to 1 in names such as Viacom, Discovery, Baidu, Tencent Music, IQiYi, and other assorted hilarity. With the bath that Chinese stonks have taken lately and the precipitous fall from 100 to as low as 38 in Viacom, it's easy to dismiss good old billy boy as just another retard in over his head.\n\nBut this guy saw something in Viacom. Instead of telling the entire Archegos story, i'll lay out the sequence of events as relates specifically to VIAC's share price.\n\n[A lot of times, retards throw out random price targets that stocks will never hit in their entire existence. Here, we already know what VIAC is capable of. Sure it took a 20-1 levered Korean fund to get us there, but this glimpse to the past is actually a glimpse into our future. I'll hold off on naming an end of year price target myself though, I don't like doing that without building a full model which I just don't have the time for tonight. ](https://preview.redd.it/rul9xc7v6nf71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34643da441c29a25656d6a79683e40d63c08e2b1)\n\n[This chart would probably be more useful to reflect this week's price action, however since I made this whole thing from scratch it's going to take too long so fuck it. As you can see, streaming stocks have mostly all taken a breather since March. Getting in now is a classic buy low situation, something us apes really need to start trying for a change.  ](https://preview.redd.it/h48bqj886nf71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72cbacf88a2561531bf19d1685159119d8763346)\n\n**4. MERGER MANIA!!?** \n\nWSB might be composed of a bunch of retards that barely know how the market work, but everyone knows this: if you own stock or options in a company and it gets bought out, it is the FASTEST and most satisfying path to tendies. Strategic acquisitions are known to pay a [much higher premium](https://labusinessjournal.com/news/2021/jul/19/stamps-com-acquired-7-billion/) to what a company is trading for on the open market. There's no better way to exit a position than waking up to an alert that something you own has been acquired.\n\nAt least that's how Discovery shareholders felt the morning of May 17th before ***discovering*** they weren't getting bought out, they were getting CEO Zaslav's turd sandwich of a merger in which AT&amp;T dumped HBO and all their associated debt on Discovery shareholders, who only get a paltry 29% of the new entity while AT&amp;T holders get 71%. AT&amp;T holders fared no better as the announcement accompanied the news that AT&amp;T had to nuke their dividend to get this deal done, which was the only reason to own that POS to begin with. It was a rare deal in which everyone loses, except Zaslav himself.\n\nBut while DISCA owners were left holding their dick's, a world of possibilities were opened up for the remaining players in the streaming space to be acquired by the giants. Shortly after Amazon acquired the private MGM studios, which basically only has James Bond at this point. Much speculation ensued about whether the remaining players (VIAC, Lionsgate, AMCX, CURI) would be acquired by the giants of Netflix, Apple, Amazon, Disney etc.\n\nI'm not going to sit here and lie to everyone and say a merger is imminent, I have no fucking clue. What I do know is Shari Redstone, chairwoman and largest stakeholder, is finally [open](https://www.wsj.com/articles/comcast-ceo-brian-roberts-and-viacomcbs-chairman-shari-redstone-met-to-discuss-streaming-partnership-11626743478) to shopping Viacom, something her father would have never considered. With a complete portfolio of sports, children's, and boomer linear, no acquisition would fix Amazon or Apple's lackluster TV efforts than Viacom. However, I don't think Viacom needs to be acquired, I think they have a legitimate shot of being a player in this space on their own. \n\n**TL;DR We don't need to be bought out for tendies, but it sure wouldn't hurt. No acquisition would be more attractive than Viacom to immediately turn a tech giant into a streaming powerhouse. It's merely the difference between mooning sooner vs. mooning later. Either way, Shari's listening.** \n\n**5. Analyst Price Targets**\n\nUpgrades are coming. With earnings this good, we're already starting to see upgrades TODAY from analysts who weren't too lazy to pass in their work by EOD. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Bank of America also has a 53 PT from last quarter. I would expect further upgrades from the rest of the street tomorrow. ](https://preview.redd.it/mixl44gu8nf71.png?width=473&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be78d48b7c413066e1372b36ce1a7646df207a58)\n\nEven Without accounting for the new upgrades from today or tomorrow, the average VIAC price target is still $50.34, representing a 21% upside. \n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nI wanted to get into some technincal analysis of this thing (cup and fucking handle anyone???) as well as risk factors but I'm out of time, I'll save those for a Part 2. Will be happy to answer any questions in the comments. \n\n**TL;DR: Viacom has been consolidating for over 4 months and is finally about to fucking blow the roof off after showing phenomenal growth in a space primed for industry consolidation. This is the best positioned streamer as far as IP goes, and an acquisition would moon this basically immediately (while not essential to the investment thesis, it would be nice of course).**  \n\n**Forget the moon, forget Uranus, we are going to PLUTO.**  [\ud83d\ude80](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/)\n\n**7.

        "selftext": " Sup Retards  \n\nI am here representing the high-functioning half of RetardedHedgeFund LLC. I founded RetardedHedgeFund with my brother way back in 2021, when, one day, my brother came to me asking for help laundering $17 that he stole from some teenage boys. As has unfortunately happened many times before, my brother took the money after beating a group of boys senseless because they had made fun of his doll collection. Now, despite what some people around here seem to think about hedge fund managers, I am not one to typically take part in financial crimes such as money laundering, but the last time my brother had stolen money in this way, the state police came to our door and demanded he return the cash. For whatever reason, the fact that the police asked for the money to be returned ticked my brother off. He started kicking and screaming and punching police officers, until he wound up in the psychward and I was left with an rather large hospital bill. So there I was, stuck between my brothers insurmountable anger management issues, the State Police,  and the fact that teenage boys will never stop making fun of a grown man who sits on a public street in his underpants playing with dolls, especially when that man is well known for being a violent adversary to teenage boys. I digress.  \n\nIn that moment, I thought the best way to avoid a similar confrontation with the police, would be to \u201claunder\u201d my brother\u2019s $17 using a broker app and one of the fine stocks found in the Wallstreetbets portfolio. After helping my brother scour the first class market data available on WSB, we decided to go all in on AMC. As one might expect, in nearly an instant our $17 grew to over $1000. I told my brother we were selling, to which he started yelling \u201cbuy and hold\u201d while punching me in protest, and then snatched the phone from my hand. For better or worse, during the scuffle, my brother fat-fingered Robin Hood and sold our call option right when AMC hit $69 and we were left with $1123 USD in our broker account. My brother wanted to put the money immediately back in AMC, but I slyly convinced him it would be better to reinvest after it was confirmed that resistance at $420.69 had been broken. That\u2019s when we decided to take our $1123 and found our family-owned hedge fund, RetardedHedgeFund LLC.  \n\nWith our freshly minted LLC, my brother wanted our first buy to be the cheapest GME calls available, and as many as we could get. However, I managed to convince him that since we were now officially big time Wallstreetbets players with our own hedge fund, we should take a look at the more mature memestocks of mememania round two. Eventually, we wound up 40% down on CLNE, which is why we are here on a Saturday morning reading a yet-to-be passed 2700 page US Senate [Infrastructure Bill](https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/e/a/ea1eb2e4-56bd-45f1-a260-9d6ee951bc96/F8A7C77D69BE09151F210EB4DFE872CD.edw21a09.pd), praying we find someway out of this god forsaken play.  \n\nIn all sincerity, from what I\u2019ve read thus far, I\u2019ve found the bill quite compelling, especially in terms placing bets this autumn. I haven\u2019t read a federal bill since I briefly taught Social Studies in what the US President had recently deemed an \u201curban disaster,\u201d and a \u201ccomplete shithole.\u201d Luckily, none of my students could read, so they never found out that I can\u2019t read either. My brother on the other hand, with his severe cognitive disability and far-below average IQ, is actually well-suited for the craft of US Law, and he has helped me sift through the gargantuan pdf to pull out a section that gave us enough hope to keep holding CLNE.  \n\nI know that a lot of you reading this will have an adverse reaction to the mentioning of CLNE, and probably think I should cut my loses and load up on 0dte spy options or juicy AMC calls at the 140 strike, but that\u2019s not what this is about. This post, which will be getting progressively less shitpost-y (unless you think the Infrastructure Bill is a shitpost), is about the $1T Infrastructure Bill presently being amended in the Senate and likely to, in some form, become law by September. There is a seemingly endless amount of provisions within this bill that could lend themselves to both bull and bear theses for the coming months. For instance, I considered posting about another play I am researching, Lithium Americas Corp (LAC). Everyone knows there\u2019s some stuff in this bill about lithium mining, but it also has a surprising amount of legislating about Native Americans and \u201cIndian Land\u201d management. It so happens that a section of North America\u2019s largest lithium deposit is also the site of an exceptionally haunting Native American massacre and Indian burial ground known as *Dead Moon,* which has presently entangled LAC in a lawsuit with local tribes and stopped them from breaking ground at Thacker Pass. I will probably dig through the bill for LAC related content after my brother goes to adult summer camp, but for now, much like teenage boys and the State Police, my brother has a seemingly irrational hatred for indigenous peoples, and so he insisted we research CLNE and not LAC.  \n\nI\u2019m not trying to convince anyone here to invest in CLNE\u2014in fact the last thing I want is pt Wallstreetbets ganging up on CLNE again. You people brought the worst kind of attention to this stock, and instead of gliding gently up to $20 all summer like I originally imagined, the CEO Andrew Littlefair has been issuing shares and shaking us all down, and after he hyped up the meme rally on CNBC last June. This sub got the PnD vibes all up on this pile of manure.  \n\nFor those of you who know nothing other about CLNE other than cow fart emojis, *\u201cClean Energy Fuels provides natural gas as an alternative fuel for vehicle fleets and related fueling solutions, primarily in the United States and Canada. It supplies RNG, compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) for light, medium, and heavy-duty vehicles. Additionally, the company offers operation and maintenance services for public and private vehicle fleet customer stations.*\u201d They take methane from a biomass (cow farts) and turn into a gas that powers engines comprable to diesl, and the also are getting into hydrogen for fuel cells for private vehicles. A big part of it is a carbon emissions play, and since CLNE is expanding their infrastructure as fast as anyone in the field, the Infrastructure Bill has everything to do with them.  \n\nI don\u2019t know what other retard\u2019s High School environmental science class experience was like, but I had this hippie, kind-of dyke-y but in way that was subtly hot, teacher tell me that California would be on fire by 2025 and Florida would be sinking if we didn\u2019t do things like turn cow farts into fuel for Amazon trucks. That teacher was eventually fired after she was found in a locked room with my brother while he was wearing only his underpants, but the cow farts thing stuck with me.  This 10th grade level understanding of environmental science was the reason I originally bought into CLNE \u2013 that coupled with the fact that a lot of federal politicians today look and sound like my high school science teacher did back then, and more and more politicians of all stripes are coming around to the idea of at least cashing in on greenwashing. Greenwashing trending upwards with potential federal support is good for CLNE.  \n\n**Infrastructure Bill** **&amp; CLNE DD**\n\nOverall the bill looks incredibly bullish for CLNE. It appears bi-partisan support has grown for RNG, carbon emissions reduction, methane capture, fuel production from feedstock and biomass, and12 pt hydrogen fuel cells. There is massive amounts of money being boasted in this bill going to things like grants, loans, support for labor. It\u2019s unclear at this point how much this is progressive pandering and an unattainable pipe dream, and it seems unlikely it will be nowhere near as far-reaching as the New Deal era infrastructure funding, but it might be coming at just the right time for many.  \n\nHere are some highlights from the [earnings call](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cms-energy-corp-cms-q2-2021-earnings-call-transcript-2021-07-29) which we can compare to elements of the Infrastructure Bill.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Increasing supply while in talks with \u201cdozens of dairies\u201d sign on as partners. (Infrastructure will be needed to capture cow farts.)     \n \n* The largest vehicle fueling infrastructure in the country, which provides the mechanism to generate the valuable environmental fuel credits.  \n \n* Signing RNG supply contracts with third-parties to meet today\u2019s growing demand.  \n \n* Increasing customers in New York,  Arkansas, Nebraska, California, and Amazon.    \n \n* Facilitating training classes with the Natural Gas Vehicle Institute for dozens of maintenance technicians who will be keeping the Amazon trucks on the road.  \n \n* Electric \tand hydrogen-fuel cell trucks, albeit great, are perhaps limited by \tinfrastructure and mineral resources. Using the s California Air Resources Board carbon intensity scoring, \\[an \texample\\] company would have to purchase over 6,400 electric heavy duty trucks, or 13,000 fuel cell trucks to achieve the same carbon \treduction as only 1,200 trucks running a negative carbon RNG.  \n \n* Recently submitted bids to build hydrogen stations for transit agencies that will be testing a handful of hydrogen buses.  \n \n\nContent pulled from the bill to get an idea on language and numbers of provisions that might help CLNE:  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* $20,000,00 wastewater grant for each of fiscal years 2022 through 16 2026, which includes funds for sludge (cow shit) collection, installation of anaerobic digester, methane capture, \tmethane transfer, facility upgrades and retrofits, and other new and emerging, but proven, technologies that transform waste to energy.  \n \n* Some related grants have requirements such as must be \u201cregionally dispersed across the United States and can leverage natural gas to the maximum extent practicable\u201d which fits CLNE current business perfectly.    \n \n* \u201cAppalachian regional energy hub initiative\u201d  The Appalachian Regional Commission may provide technical assistance to, make grants to, enter into contracts with, or otherwise provide amounts to \tindividuals or entities in the Appalachian region for projects and \tactivities, at will help establish a regional energy hub in the Appalachian region for natural gas and  natural gas liquids, including hydrogen produced from the steam methane reforming of natural gas feedstocks. (Grants to develop methane capture infrastructure, bullish sign for potential third-party contractors in new localities.)  \n \n* $52,488,065,375 \tthrough 2026 per each to build infrastructure to reduce highway emissions.    \n \n* Massive \tamounts of funding going to hydrogen found in Tittle III FUELS AND TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS. The \tentire Title III may be worth a look through if you want a bullish feeling for CLNE, but especially \u201cSubtittle 3--Hydrogen Research and Development,\u201d as \tRNG can be used to produce zero emissions hydrogen, and it \tspecifically mentions getting hydrogen from biomass and bio fuels, so it\u2019s easy to see CLNE taking advantage.     \n \n\nWhether it\u2019s intentional or not, a lot of Littlefair\u2019s language on the call seems to come from having spent some time reading the bill. Big investors interested in CLNE are also likely watching the bill to estimate where state money is going.  Perhaps Littlefair is aping the bills language in order to appeal to big investors, and if this is true, it would seem Littlefair was successful because there was a plethora of institutional buys on the day after the call.  \n\n**The Present State of CLNE Stock and Retail Perception**\n\nI bought into CLNE in June when it was under $10. I had spent weeks staring nervously at exceptionally retarded calls on another stock and wanted to just park some money somewhere and let it drift upwards while I dozed through the summer, and CLNE seemed like a good buy at $10. Analysts had (have) it anywhere from $10-27, and it seemed like the recent changes in DC would lend to even more upside. Then Wallstreetbets started shouting about CLINE SI% (which barely made any fucking sense, by the way) the stock shot up to $15 on retail power and perhaps the relatively few shorts there exiting, all the retards, including \u201cmy brother,\u201d lost money on calls, and the mood about CLINE around here got very negative.\n\nInstead of drifting up to twenty, CLNE spent the summer drifting down to $6. I did not enjoy it, but I held the bag, believing it would have to go up eventually. When the earnings report came-out last Thursday night, and at the same time the stock slumped to its 2021 low, I was in despair. Where were the greenwashing greenbacks? What we\u2019re the politicians in DC doing besides trying to figure out if their pants are on or not, shouting about how a virus is going to kill everyone if we don\u2019t take a vaccine that half of the population refuses to take, and looking for their son\u2019s laptop?\n\nAs culturally enriching as the president\u2019s son\u2019s DIY tweaker porn is, I thought perhaps there might be even more going on behind the scenes in DC when I decided to peak into the Infrastructure Bill. In all earnestness, I was very doom n gloom at 5AM the morning after CLNE earnings. I was smacked from sleep at 3:30AM with anxiety about a sell-off, and lying in a semi-hypnagogic state, I shit you not, I see floating above my bed, a funny looking man with big ears in a cow field, smile and say, You should just sell, son. The earnings report stated a decrease of 99.2% (yes, 99.2% decrease, just like your memestock calls). Supposedly this decrease was due to a tricky deal with Amazon, but I didn\u2019t want to think about Rocketman blasting off with hydrogen, any more than I did Littlefair issuing shares. I wanted money. Furthermore, the news is blaring about Delta variant, people invested in 3rd world vaccines are shouting about the ineffectiveness of mRNA in the rage filled chatrooms of my broker app, and I start thinking I should cut my losses with CLNE and invest in a Playstation so I can try to teach my brother how to play *Last of Us* in order to prepare him for inevitable modern tribal warfare coupled with a zombie apocalypse.  \n\nThe earnings were, in actuality, not nearly as bad this Amazon deal made them look. Although revenue decreased because of the deal, CLNE increased RNG sales by 13%. As Litlefair said in the call, \u201cexcluding the effects of the Amazon warrant charges and the commodity swap and customer fueling contracts unrealized losses, revenue for the second quarter of 2021 increased by 28.9% to compared to  for the second quarter of 2020.\u201d\n\nThis is going to sound cheesy, but the Infrastructure Bill was a little ray of sunshine during what, in my more narcotic induced brain damaged moments, seems clearly to be the end of the world. My hedge fund does not participate in electoral politics publicly or privately; my brother is not allowed to vote (not because he\u2019s retarded, but because he\u2019s a convicted felon), and I find elections to have an adverse reaction with my relatively fragile mental health. I don\u2019t think a political party is going to save Earth from the human race. I think California will cease to be a state the moment Andrew Littlefair\u2019s cow fart machines explode and fire consumes the entire West Coast. But there is actually something in the bill that I have not felt from the federal govt probably ever in my life, but especially since the pandemic started, and that was some sort of expectation that there will be a future. Despite my better judgment, this sensation felt good to me. Furthermore, this sensation, to me, seems to be an excellent marketing tool for this particular moment and it will make the bill and it\u2019s consequences at least temporally popular. People have indulged in their unchecked desires for societal collapse and death for the last 18 months, and I think perhaps we are sick of it. What people want to know now is that they can work (and yes, actually have jobs) to improve the world for a future with or without CVOVID.  The Infrastructure Bill is going to create jobs that some people (at least momentarily) will feel good about doing, it\u2019s going to increase revenue in multiple sectors (and decrease it in some), it\u2019s bi-partisan, 70% popular with voters, and in the end it could probably pay for itself by not making the money printer go brrrr so much once everyone has a decent job again. To me, of course, all this gooey-oooey goody two shoes democracy is a load of BS, because ultimately what the bill will do is at last make CLNE drift gently up to $20. I believe it already may have begun to do that before the bill is even passed, in fact.  \n\nAt 7.48 CLNE is a good to buy if you don't mind holding for months, possibly year for big gains. After skimming through the bill the last couple days, I don\u2019t really see a limit to the upside. The Federal Govt. is going all in on financially supporting a phase-out of fossil fuels. Oil is likely get tanked by another winter of COVID, while the govt is going to be offering grants, subsidies, loans, to companies like CLNE. With vaccines and better knowledge of the virus, CLNE is likely to able to continue increasing productivity. Retail isn\u2019t really buying these days, but institutions greatly increased their holdings this past week, with the majority of big buys coming in the day after earnings were released.  \n\nI\u2019m now taking all of our incoming funds and investing them in to CLNE shares every time my brother beats someone up and steals their money. Risky options don't seem worth it here right now, because the stock price seems relatively in the control of big money, and big money will be the one selling you the options. The stock is largely owned by institutions, likely because it\u2019s easy to imagine how revenues will be on a steady uptrend for many years to come, especially with this Infrastructure Bill presently making it's way through congress. That said I could see $8 by Aug 20, if i were to place a relatively placid bet.",

It looks like AMC is bottoming out, and has entered it's next accumulation phase, which is signaled by a period of relatively low volatility and volume which could go on over several more weeks.\n\nSince the third of august, AMC has been trading in a relatively small upwards channel, in blue on the chart below, and I expect this to continue for a while. \n\nI expect the price to eventually break the red resistance line, retesting it, and then moving to the upper bound of the blue channel. I have marked this possible scenario with a green line in the chart below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hhwjjhkxaxi71.png?width=1541&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86d3b620096bb1ca0f40bc844ac3c500e69e976f\n\n**MACD**\n\nThe MACD is still green and signalizes a possible continuation the price to the upside.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gafaw1p2cxi71.png?width=1436&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6636792d7e186758fb95300c006a75f8c4c11b5\n\n **RSI** \n\nThe RSI is climbing, together with the price, after making a double bottom on the 4th of august:  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bpsjn31mcxi71.png?width=1540&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b8e7514ad1bb1e41f7629eba67ae6a2fa2c4255\n\n \n\n**TLDR - Points of interest**\n\nLong  Positions: I am looking for an entry on the lower bound of the blue channel, if price falls down  there again. I am also looking for a break of the red resistance  for a rally to around 39. If 39 breaks, I am looking at around 42.5.\n\nShort  Positions: I am looking for a bounce either off the red resistance, or the upper bound of the blue channel, back to the lower bound of the blue channel. If the lower bound of the blue channel breaks, price could go down to 29 again.\n\nGodspeed retards",

        "selftext": "  \n\nToday as I sipped my coffee in my backyard I was keeping my ear to the streets as I normally do in the latest financial gossip. I\u2019ve recently heard about the new craze that is seemingly lingering longer than I thought it would. Non-fungible tokens or NFTs are being ushered into the millennial and zoomer populations by creatively bankrupt Hollywood has-beens and noteworthy celebrities. Lindsay Lohan and other bold innovators of the investor class like Soulja Boy and Mark Cuban. Both of them are well known for their reliable and professional investment advice and business savvy. Cuban who has recently been an avid promoter of the Wallstreet bets pump and dump movement and Soulja Boy who was recently sued by Nintendo over his cheap Chinese knock-off video game consoles violated more than a dozen copyright laws. \n\nHonestly, my first impression of these NFT\u2019s is a bit on the cynical side. Perhaps it is just my overactive imagination paired with a sense of dark humor. But I truly see people buying these NFT\u2019s as a sign of the apocalypse. The concept wasn\u2019t totally foreign to me. Video gamers have been using digital inventory for real-world currency for a long time. Online communities tend to have websites that facilitate in real-world trade of money for in-game items or digital loot drops from other players. Online trading card games have had digital copies of rare cards that are commonly traded for money too. Online party hats in a video game called Runescape sold for 7 thousand USD between private sellers. But are we really at a stage in the economic cycle where the best course of action is to buy digital content to pad your portfolio? \n\nAre we really at a moment in history where people are actually purchasing a Lindsey Lohan NFT for 17 thousand dollars? Is dancing GIFS of Mark Cuban to your portfolio really going to be a solid item for your child\u2019s financial future? Will AMC one day let us pay for our movies with Zuckerberg GIFs or pre-expulsion Trump Tweets? Will canceled celebrities have to sell their NFTs in shady alleys and on street corners within flash drives? I don\u2019t truly know and I don\u2019t want to pretend to know the answer. While it\u2019s really easy to cherry-pick from the dregs of the Hollywood influencer types. There is real money being moved by major players in the digital market. A GIF of a cat-poptart hybrid called \u201cNyan-Cat\u201d sold for 450 thousand dollars and Kings of Leon\u2019s album sold for 6 million dollars respectively. \n\nIn both instances, the content is already released to the public. The owners don\u2019t collect any revenue or royalties anytime the GIFs are used or the albums are played. In fact, the only thing gained is a sense of ownership within our digital world. While the world stands on the brink of opening up, the flood of money into online and virtual assets is staggering. Why buy real estate when you can buy virtual real estate? There was an old saying by Mark Twain. \u201cBuy land, they aren\u2019t making any more of it.\u201d I can\u2019t help but reflect on that as I see more and more of the virtual space be paved. How much farther into technology is society really trying to dive in and how much are people really willing to invest into this frontier? \n\nOn one level this seems to be a desperate attempt for people with influence to make money from their followers by truly trying to offer them the clout of virtual asset ownership instead of conventionally making products to sell to them. On another level, this is pop culture and pop art manifesting its own free market. I don\u2019t believe the Government will get involved yet in a major capacity on either side of the pendulum either. I think the government trying to restrict the sale of virtual art is about as likely as them releasing their own NFTs of what\u2019s within area 51 or who killed JFK. \n\nBut on another level, I also think that NFTs are a way where people can support their content creators and help support them in more meaningful ways beyond a tip. Instead of donations and handouts, people are now able to get collectibles and memorabilia that might hold and maintain some value as opposed to nothing. We live in a world where artists and entertainers stream a variety of content to their fans and audiences. The idea that the words we utter, the pictures we take, and our online memories can all be bought and sold are a new chapter in this digital economy. In today\u2019s day and age, you\u2019re money.",

I support GME both AMC and GME. Full disclosure I am not the first to point out these similarities but I have looked into them myself using the charts I pulled off of the SEC Website. AL Trades is where I first heard the information about a week ago in a youtube video and I just went and did some of my own digging to confirm the information he provided. \n\nLooking at the Charts you see peaks in FTDs in Both GME and AMC before the price run up. **FOR GME HAPPENED 3 TIMES and THE FTD PATTERN HAS AN ERIE CORRELATION THE SHARE PRICE IMO.** \n\nThe Peak FTDs for GME were just over 3m and GMEs Float is 56m according to Google\n\n3m FTDs / 56m Shares = just over 5% of the float \n\nThe Peak FTDs for AMC were just over 27M and the float according to google is 511m\n\n27m FTDs / 511m Shares = Just over 5% of the Float \n\nThe Peak FTDs for CLOV were just over 19m and the Float according to Google is 133M\n\n19m FTD\u2019s / 133m Shares = **Just over 14%**!\n\nAnother thing I want to point out is that AMC before it big run up had a mini squeeze similar to what we saw from CLOV in June. \n\nAMC went from around $2 to $20 then back down to $6 \n\nCLOV went from $6 to $28 and is now in the $8 range which it has been for a couple of weeks now. Is the Bottom in for CLOV? I don\u2019t really know but I hope so. \n\n**Full disclosure I am a CLOV shareholder and very bullish on CLOV from all of My research I have done and that others have done.** \n\n**I am not a financial adviser and this is not financial advice. Just pointing out some things I see from the Charts.** \n\n**I hope that everybody does they\u2019re own due diligence before investing and hope that everybody makes some money investing.** \n\n**If you don\u2019t like this post, please provide some constructive feedback and specific reasons why.** \n\n**Last but not least LFG GME AMC AND CLOV.**",

        "selftext": "All year for about 13 months now I've  been heavy on growth. I've come close to my position nearly doubling in value, and then lost all my profits in February. Shot back up in June and then crumbled back close to break even again recently.\n\nI have learned a lot over the year. A lot about growth vs value and the importance of fundamentals.  I've made some mistakes like fomoing but I think now it's made me a smarter investor.\n\n\nI recently basically liquidated all my shares and moved to a  cash position on everything bar some dividend stocks and some safe tech like AAPL and NVDA( up a good few percent on both so a massive correction to breakeven wouldn't even worry me. \n\nI'm in my 20s and my total investment worth is about 15k including My recent cash position. \n\nI sold tesla today and this hurt. I will be buying back. I must think it's way too risky in the short term. And I also need a house so the 15k would be close to a deposit down payment. But I'm not against going all in on an undervalued company such as HPQ(price to earnings is like 10 and they pay dividends.)\n\nI made some profits off Chinese EV. But personally I feel that is one of the most dangerous sectors in the market. Especially with what's going on with CCP recently.\n\n\nJust wanted to make this to  see if there is similar sentiment about thinking valuations have gone absolutely insane in growth stocks , tech and EV.\n\n\nI am now a bear on the market as a whole. And take my advise. I used to think dividend or value plays were a real boring way to invest. They seemed it in 2020. But in 21 they are a far better play.\n\n\nMy advice: inflation is going to wreck growth in the short term. And I'd keep some cash aside for dips if you are an investor. I can't shake the feeling the market is being propped up so artificially, and we are in for a serious correction.\n\n\nLove to hear from you guys and don't feel like you can't dm me or comment some questions..\n\nBTW I'm not into memes. Its cool if you are but my post isn't signalling the MO ASS because I think we are in for a correction or crash. In fact i think stocks like amc and gme will suffer like growth will as well.

        "selftext": "\nA few months ago, I became excited about the realm that was stocks and investing. I saw explosion of meme stocks that was AMC and GME and couldn\u2019t get wait to get on. I put a small amount of money into crypto and onto stocks. Then I left my investing accounts alone for a bit. \n\nEvery month I would use DCA and buy some crypto and put a little more in stocks. My portfolio was selling coming together but it was literal pennies to what happened later. This month I would make a series of options that bought my portfolio from 300 to 3000. I was ecstatic, that was bigger than any paycheck I gotten so far. $3000 is chump changed and I planned on getting that to 30k by the end of the year. \n\nI didn\u2019t see how I was slowly falling into gambling. There was no excuse. I\u2019m didn\u2019t understand the greeks, IV. Yes I know how stupid I am and how that sounds. I would flip a coin and bet with my greedy ass head, not understanding the fundamentals well enough nor do tying to learn it. Last week I made one bad call and got burnt hard.  I got desperate, I began revenge trading and chasing my losses rather than just moving on. 0DTE calls. Increasingly riskier positions. I would be too easily effected by my emotions and would spend hours glued on my phone, watching as my account bled red. As gamblers fallacy, I bet the last remaining of my buying power on a Hail Mary. (AMC) Yes, roast me and burn me on a stake that\u2019s what I did. \n\nBut it worked! I had gained 56% of my losses back, yet I wasn\u2019t content. I wanted to wipe away all my losses and I held. Held to the point where my account got wiped out and I lost 75% of my portfolio. It\u2019s here that realized that I was doing. I was on verge of liquidating all my stocks and withdrawing more money to gain my losses. I knew then I had to stop. \n\nI\u2019m not broke, I don\u2019t know anyone money nor do I have major financial obligations. I have my parents who support me through everything I do. I\u2019m getting a new job next week. Why am I writing this? I guess as a reflection as my short descent into a near gambler. I\u2019m not smarter than the market nor should one every skip the fundamentals of the market. ESPECIALLY for something like options. I had no exit strategy nor risk management. I am happy that I was able to grow my account 10x in less than a month. However 3k in the grand scheme is nothing. I\u2019m taking this time to understand and work on my weakness. I want to hug my parents and tell them I\u2019ll do better. I\u2019m going to deactivate my trading account and focus on learning and building up my capital before I tamper with the market again. A painful lesson but one I felt like I needed. \n\nTLDR; Dumb kid with beginner luck thinks he\u2019s better than the market and nearly loses it all.",

        "selftext": "I've been sitting patiently waiting for the money to flow back into the memes, and it looks like we are just getting started.   \n\n\nFirst let us first examine our faithful slut SPY. Reaching returns of over 100% since March lows, it is time for this baby to start a correction. Looking like \"sell in September\" is going to be a real thing for all the boomers real soon. Looking at the chart below, it is only a matter of time before SPY decides to dump its pants. I'm not saying a recession type of drop, but at least a small correction. My target would be the blue zone marked below, but I would expect at least a retest of 400 at some point.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/otk9bws3bej71.png?width=597&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e308ef6d7b168dcf9c1d3bb4c94c8d4ec80c5d7d\n\nNow on to our memes. BB (Blackberry for all you newbs), has been patiently consolidating, waiting for an outflow from boomer equities back into the memes. If you have been paying attention the past few months, you notice that any time the market starts to fall, the memes start to pop a little. It's almost like people are treating the meme stocks as safety for their cash because they have been pretty consistent with basically having a negative Beta. \n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jsnvy5bocej71.png?width=482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29185f1559ae2ef9819853b4f9bcb5a5890ccde\n\nIf you look at the chart below, this is the weekly chart showing the first and second meme pumps casually lifting off the long term trendline marked. The selling has dried up, and volume managed to enter at the right time to maintain our trend. Now if this holds and BB manages to break above our ATH($28.77), $40 per share could be possible given that the current market situation develops as I imagine it will, with SPY falling at the same time the memes are catching significant inflow.   \n\n\nCurrent position in BB: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2rcqrj6scej71.png?width=918&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=459d81e090de32f6a06af99303d7ca11fcf12764\n\nCurrent position in SPY (lottos):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/35c84pkvcej71.png?width=859&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f703a336d834c7143a689d881bf7d0db063d1d9a\n\nBB, AMC, GME, lets fuck the hedgies once again. \n\nYou can also follow more of my bullshit at TheStonksDaddy on twitter.",

        "selftext": "I apologize in advance for my terrible English, it is not my native language. I want to raise the FTD topic. The other day I had nothing to do and I started looking at all the stocks that had a short-squeeze this year. In addition to the GME and AMC (AMC - FTD 5.5%, and 3 months later a jump in the price of 3500%, GME - FTD 4,5%, after 2 months leap in price in 3000-4000%)\n\nWKHS: FTD 2%, and 2 months later a jump on 100%\n\nBBBY: FTD 1.7%, and after 3 months leap 300%\n\nPRTS: FTD-1.4%, after 3 months, a jump of 100%\n\nIn short, I sat like this, checked the companies, went through all the meme tickers of reddit, among other things. And at some point I caught myself that seeing the number of shares in FTD and the subsequent price jump after a while, I can roughly determine how many shares in the company are in circulation. And suddenly I guessed the approximate number of shares, well, give or take 20 million.\n\nAnd then I come to the palantir $ PLTR. I see that they had a jump in FTD of 20 million shares in February. But the price chart shows calm and silence. A huge number of shares in FTD and no impact on the price. I must admit, at that moment I was afraid. Did the theory fail? After all, in order for such a huge number of shares in FTD not to affect the price, the total number of shares in circulation should be huge. I looked at how many shares palantir has in turnover-1.8 billion, so FTD is about 1 percent, everything is fine.\n\nIn general, what I'm talking about: all companies whose FTD was at least about 2% had a jump after 2-4 months. In the case of GME and AMC and their FTD in the region of 5%, the growth was already in 3000-4000%. Oh, yes. Do you know what FTD CLOV had on July 8, to be precise? 12,8%. I will leave the conclusions to you, I will only say that I have not seen such a percentage in any company.\n\nSee for yourself how surprisingly the FTD chart and the price chart correlate\n\n[GME](https://preview.redd.it/08tu4vjtq5h71.jpg?width=1281&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f84998519ce121e095c31eaa2813f44ae24f7576)\n\n[AMC](https://preview.redd.it/jb6nxuisq5h71.jpg?width=1487&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8f1ac5b2faa741deed09701dc772af937656fc0)\n\n[WKHS](https://preview.redd.it/7ve3trerq5h71.jpg?width=1327&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c25520667265563822bd45be01556a8ebc3009f2)\n\n[PRTS](https://preview.redd.it/1n4ql6dqq5h71.jpg?width=1344&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=418b5ee816d9cd01be854313cc584ff59652c72a)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[CLOV](https://preview.redd.it/g6l4024pq5h71.jpg?width=1320&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ff362bffb0c0170e2a152ec8561a8d91df8746a)",

        "selftext": "Did you come to Wallstreetbets today looking for a cure to ~~chlamydia~~ *your stupidity*? Well, look no further, friend! Using my masterful TA skills, I'm going to cure you of that burning sensation you get when you ~~pee~~ *look at your portfolio*! With this ***one simple trick***, all of your terrible life choices will resolve themselves into brilliant investment decisions! And for the first time ever: featuring a TL;DR on a Cbass post. Wow!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: We're all going to be rich\\* as fuck!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Table of Contents:**\n\nPart 1. Begun, the Meme Wars have\n\n1. GME\n2. AMC\n3. BB\n4. CLOV\n\nPart 2. The Voice of Alex Jones\n\nPart 3. A New Hope\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Part 1. Begun, the Meme Wars have**\n\nThis past week saw an appreciable awakening of the memes, particularly GME and AMC, with knock-on effects across the whole of the Meme-verse. This was followed by a sea of gain porn and concomitant conspiracy theories about insiders among us. \n\nWell, ol' Cbass is here to clear things up with Star Wars references, bad jokes, and even worse TA. So let's have us a gander at some magic space-wizard charts to answer the age old question: ***Am I going to lose all my money.... again?***\n\nStarting with the OG, GME:\n\n[We're comin' fer ya, hedgies! Reee!](https://preview.redd.it/1a4yyt2we6k71.png?width=1576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ef8fcd2046ff1417684d4a52f17a0353ff02e03)\n\nAccording to my long since discarded thesis, GME was supposed to find support at the $218 level where the last breakout occurred (Launch #3). That failed worse than my last date, oh so many years ago. Then someone here claimed that the thin green uptrend line I've got on there was supposed to hold. That failboat sailed to a galaxy far, far away. But the #2b breakout line did, at last, managed to hold. And then we got a breakout of that nasty red downtrend this week and now we're trying, once more to breakout of of the #3 line. \n\nSo, does GME have it in itself to do enter hyperspace? Well, from a DD perspective earnings are coming up and that is probably going to spell doom or boom for the ticker. The company is in the midst of a turnaround, so it at least has a good story going for it (unlike anything Disney owns). \n\nFrom a TA perspective... well, to be honest, TA is just there so you can feel better or worse about your decision. It can't really predict all that much, except for after the fact. But it can give traders some piece of mind before the fact; a sort of all-clear that many need before jumping in a position. To that extent, getting out from under that downtrend was a big deal. From here, it's all on the shoulders of retail to initiate **Operation Bagholder Rescue**, if it is to happen at all. \n\n**Cbass's Call for GME:** I actually think you ~~retards~~ *brilliant, forward thinking investors* have it in you to break back over $218. Can you bust the $330 double top? I'm not so confident, but I'd be happily proven wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext up, an empty movie theater for a Disney Star Wars showing, AMC:\n\n[Supreme stupidity, in chart form](https://preview.redd.it/ja0puvoug6k71.png?width=1576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab226485fe17812dfc4c94cd4d0d661d31d6eb56)\n\nMy previous thesis called for AMC to retrace to the #2a line, $14.54. Whelp, y'all decided to buy up the whole damn company and proceeded to prove me wrong. But in the true form of a TA Jedi Master, I've just *ex post facto* revised my thesis so that I'm still correct: Now I'm calling the May-June launch a Double-Event, so powerful it impregnated half the girls in Bangkok, because *reasons*. Accordingly, the settling at the #2b line is right in line with my \"original\" thesis. This is how it's done, young padawan.\n\nHaving found that support, this week saw AMC also breakout of a downtrend line. I've included a small uptrend channel that I saw on some other guy's AMC TA, and we've dropped back into that. Unlike GME, there is not a significant resistance line above the current position, which is nice. \n\nFrom a DD perspective, there is not much great to say about this company and \"fundamentals\" are doing nothing but holding the ticker back. Maybe if Disney hadn't fucked up Star Wars, there'd be some major films to fill the seats right now. Furthermore, management's penchant for stock sales and the possibility of more to come if you idiots actually moon this thing again *is not helping*. \n\n**Cbass's Call for AMC:** Skies look pretty clear to me; up is the direction. I wouldn't count on that channel lasting for too long, though. On the other hand, if you wunderkinds *can't* get this thing to moon, gravity will ruin your day, week, month, year, and for some of you extra special ones: *your entire financial future*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext, a company somehow survived irrelevancy, BB:\n\n[Extra \\\\\"special\\\\\" line drawing skills here](https://preview.redd.it/o39cqkfcj6k71.png?width=1576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a723faac2fda7a0dfffd6e5248d5665bac3f7b8)\n\nJust like GME, BB failed to settle at the previous breakout line (#3), and instead decided you fuckers needed the ***executive tour*** of the S&amp;M dungeon before finally settling around $9.50. BB has since broken out of *two* down trend lines! That means it's going to moon twice as hard, bro! You can readjust line #3 so it's at $11.56 or so, and then it looks like this past week's action tested and failed that line, just like was the case for GME. Indeed, from a chart-perspective GME and BB are the most closely aligned (with BBBY being a somewhat retarded cousin that ~~I've~~ *everyone has* given up talking about). \n\nFrom the DD perspective, apparently BB has some magic AI shit going for it and it's related to security and cars and shit. Whatever, just sounds like Cathie Woodisms to me, but such platitudes are the nectar of the masses and if that gets 'em to buy, who fuckin' cares. \n\nOn the TA side, this is in the same boat as GME. You've got to at least break over $11.50 to stand a chance. Over that, the skies are clear for a run into the twenties and that'll be enough for the gamblers to start hurling YOLO's at it once more. \n\n**Cbass's Call on BB**: Up if GME goes up. Sideways or down otherwise. This one's not going to move independent of Big Daddy. It's also not going to move as hard because of the large free float. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd finally, the little brother that your mom made to take to the party and is now embarrassing you in front of the hot chicks, CLOV:\n\n[No, CLOV, you were supposed to be the Chosen One. Not ruin my portfolio!](https://preview.redd.it/45d9m8f9m6k71.png?width=1576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a3985c252a10b333677c7749da916ebf1b6f171)\n\nNow, I know some of you are thinking: CLOV? What the fuck? CLOV doesn't belong on this list. It belongs on the list with WISH, WKHS and all that other garbage. And you'd be right to think that. But I still own CLOV, and it is ***technically*** not dead. It's just ***mostly dead***, and if you've seen the Princess Bride, you know that mostly dead has a cure.... unlike my stupidity. In addition, CLOV has been hovering near the top of the sentiment lists for some time, so there's that.\n\nLike the others above, CLOV has broken out of downtrend, or possibly two (I was generous with that second, orange line). However, unlike BB or GME, CLOV is nowhere near its prior breakout level. Indeed, the $9 mark is proving to be an impenetrable barrier. We might actually need a Zombie Dragon to take that fucker down. On the good side of the TA, the \\~$8 line is proving to be the actually bottom.\n\nOn the DD side, CLOV had its earnings and they were wholly unimpressive. The clovtards dug deep to find the nuggets of good, but the overall market said, \"Yeah, nah bitch,\" and slapped it back down with an extra helping of pimp-hand. \n\n**Cbass's Call for CLOV:** It exists to fuck up my yearly P/L, but if GME and AMC can take off, they'll carry CLOV and its whole clown army up with them. Problem is, there's no imminent breakout overhead. We've got to go up a ways before any true breakout can be attempted. Which means unless we get a truly epic launch of the whole Meme Space Force, CLOV has the potential to get shot down before ever getting back up to the high teens, let alone the twenties.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Part 2. The Voice of Alex Jones**\n\nIt's conspiracy theory time! Yayy! \n\nSo the voice of Alex Jones came to me in a dream the other night and it got me wondering: Is this whole endeavor an elaborate trap to ensnare idiot retail traders into terrible options that are certain to expire worthless? Let's look at the evidence. \n\nFirst, we didn't get any breakouts until after the 8/20 expiry. Together with the 7/16 expiry, this represented (I believe) a ***massive*** chunk of options. I saw this regarding CLOV, and I suspect it is a similar story for GME, AMC and BB, and a whole host of other 'meme stocks.'\n\nSecond, I'm *quite sure* at this point that Big Money is behind the Jedi Options Wizardry that causes these massive spikes. Originally, I thought that this was just a Big Money vs. Big Money game and we were naught but pawns in their schemes. \n\nNow... I'm beginning to think ~~aliens~~ ***the House*** is in on it. Basically, they are going to let/help the meme stock launches in order to rope a bunch of idiots into buying shitty options. Particularly, those who buy them of the downslope of the spikes, hoping for a quick rebound. Those options are going to be easy to kill and the House can clean up. \n\nBut they'll never get the chance if the whole meme stock \"movement\" dies a slow death. It is only by hanging a line out, enticing the morons with dreams of easy money and fast cars and loose women that they can get y'all to bite in large enough numbers. Basically, the sight of those big green dildos is impossible to resist and FOMO takes over and you dipshits buy options that are all but DoA.\n\n**So, is this all just a trap?** Answer: **yes**, no matter which way you look at it. \n\nEven disregarding my tinfoil hat ramblings, this past week's action has the smell of a classic bull-trap. \n\n**But does it actually matter?** Answer: **no**. You can still make money, and a fuck load of it, even if my tinfoil hat theory is right. *Especially* if it's right, in fact.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[We're gonna last a lot longer against those hedge funds than we will against that Citadel!](https://preview.redd.it/s1xs80j3y6k71.jpg?width=2181&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80ffff00b19d3dea26c921fe6337e039c10b8a8e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Part 3. A New Hope**\n\nI've been sensing a turning of opinion in the short time I've been here with you all. When I first came upon this wonderful community of simpletons, DD posts about new companies were most often met with \"You had me at retard\" and \"I'm all in.\" \n\nNow it seems people are too scared to post high quality DD's because the immediate response is \"Fuck your pump &amp; dump and your mom while we're at it!\" Were there pump and dumps? Too many to count. Did I fall for one? Probably. \n\nWhile some OGs are breathing a sigh of relief at this relative return to \"normality,\" and I can't blame them, I still feel a certain something has been lost. That magic feeling, that tingling in the ballsack that whispered to you, \"*this is stupid, but it might actually work anyway*.\" This week, for one glorious moment, I felt that again and damn did it feel good. \n\nSure we bagholders are a pitiable bunch. That cannot be denied, even if we keep it close to the chest, even, I think, for those most ardent cult members. Still, there is something to be said of keeping hope alive, of holding on to the belief that broken and battered simpletons left atop seemingly insurmountable peaks on charts awash in red ***can still be saved***. \n\nSo as another week comes upon us, I implore you to not lose hope, for it is *literally all we have left*. Hear that John Williams score rise in the ether about you, and know this: It's not over until we blow up ~~the Death Star~~ *our accounts*! (^(Or Disney buys us))\n\n[Que the Journey, ladies and gentlemen.](https://preview.redd.it/g8isr2tq07k71.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2dff374b682ca9cc4fef8539d121905c1401284)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\\*Rich can mean a lot of things, such as: rich in spirit, rich in experience, or rich in delusions of grandeur.**\n\nPositions or ban, a.k.a., the *Portfolio of Destiny*:\n\n[I've got 'em on the ropes, boys!](https://preview.redd.it/hk65a8ow17k71.jpg?width=1675&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89bab8c2e7df13eec9c10c339c76940983978f34)",

Let's look at the chart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Daily chart going back to the beginning of 2021](https://preview.redd.it/bvl6a9ljxjk71.png?width=2183&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a364c1a212c463dbefad365ec3fe32cc1b3faf2)\n\nThese are the horizontal lines I've decided to use. As we can see from the most recent price action we broke through $11.20 USD, retraced under it, and has been hovering around there that point today. This confirms the belief that this is a line of significance because of prior price action where we had a bounce off \\~$11.20 at the end of the first bull run in January, as well as a few days of intermittent support/resistance days in between then and now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Daily chart of the last couple months](https://preview.redd.it/705s8ibkxjk71.png?width=2181&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94eb09175463f3d4121c557a0a75c00a31f4152a)\n\nWhat is even more interesting to me is not only are we acting on this number as support/resistance in the last 5 trading days, on todays daily low we actually bounced off the 50 DMA. A small, bull pennant has also been formed in these few days by producing these higher highs and higher lows.\n\nRSI in the healthy range, and is respecting the Bollinger bands.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[1 hour chart.

This could be a large descending wedge pattern, but it's not possible to predict anything with only two points of the top of the wicks. The next run up will paint a better picture.\n\nPrediction - Large price movements within the next week. GME + AMC are already moving as well.\n\nFor traders, I would recommend waiting for a volume spike of 20+ million trades in a day. $BB is already trending upwards with relatively low volume and the bottom appears to be in.\n\nVolume spike is the only confirmation needed now for a bull run.\n\nTL;DR -  \nBullish reasons:  \n\\- Bull Pennant, descending wedge, large respect to the bottom trendline, holding above $11.20 line of significance, broken out of the downward channel, large pop off the 50dma today. Large respect to the Bollinger bands. Financials coming soon, might give insight into patent sale. RSI healthy.\n\nBearish reasons:  \n\\-Needs volume spike or there will be no large movement. \\*THIS BEING SAID WE ARE STILL IN A LARGE UPTREND. I AM ONLY SAYING THIS FOR MY PREDICTION FOR A LARGE MOVEMENT SOON\\*  \n\\-Financials may not have any insight to the patent sale. If there's no good patent sale money or information, these financials will be shit unless you guys all bought 10 copies of Cyclance to your friends and family.\n\nPosition:  \n2000 shares.\n\nDYOD.

        "selftext": "1.) When theaters go back to exclusive box office release instead of day and date streaming, movie theaters will skyrocket. On Sept 3rd, Shang Chi will be released exclusively to theaters and NOT Disney plus. Disney is losing significant amount of movie going direct to streaming and they know it. WB is going back to direct theater release at the end of 2021/early 2022. \n\n2.) Studios are creating movies with 200M+ budgets. Black Widow-200M, S. Squad-175M. The numbers don't make sense if they're NOT able to draw customers to the theaters due to PIRACY/Streaming. Scarlett Johansson/Paramount/Disney/WB know this is not sustainable. The exclusive theatrical window has been negotiated by WB to shrink from 90 to 45 days in Jan 2022.\n\n3.) The \"variant\" and reopening sentiment derailed theater stocks like CINEMARK, IMAX, Marcus the last few months. Expect a mean reversion play once cases start to decline. (This is the time to buy not in a few months).\n\n4.) CNK 1.8B market cap vs AMC 17B market cap. CNK can easily double.\n \nGross BOX OFFICE Revenues-\nJul21- 583M\nJul20- 8M\nJul19- 1.2B\n\nRevenues are still down big from 2019 but nature is starting to heal giving you an opportunity to buy low before the crowd figures it out.\n\n5.) You're buying for next year, not for TODAY'S numbers. 2021 is a transition year with the industry recovery kicking into gear in the second half of the year, which is loaded with blockbusters. 2022 will be close to back to normal with mega movies and giant franchisees fresh remakes and spin-offs that will have massive consumer appeal.\n\nExpected Revenues for CNK. \n\n2019-3.2B, 2020-0.7B, 2021E-1.5B, 2022E-3B\n\n6.) MANY movies were made for the big screen. It destroys the EXPERIENCE sitting on your couch constantly distracted by your phone. Drink at home or go out to a lounge/bar? It's the EXPERIENCE and that will never change.\n\n7.) Liquidity- limited cash burn and secured a runway into 2022 if the current operating environment continues. Negotiated payment deferrals and modifications and across a wide range of lease related auto contractual obligations. $124 million CARES ACT received during 2020 and April 2021 with an incremental 30 million expected by your end. \n\n8.) Because of FUD and media hysteria over the variant, there is a significant discount to fair value from June. Patience required. Downside maybe to 14. Upside to 20-30+",

        "selftext": "Alright apes, taking a stab and fairly robust crayon-eating DD here. I've been following HOOD pretty closely, and it looks like HOOD's short-seller's are about to hit the giant brick wall that is their wives' boyfriends.  \n\n\nHOOD is the stock ticker for company named Robinhood. They're a small, undiscovered micro-cap stock in the fintech space as a mobile-first brokerage/trading platform. A retarded group of traders are angry at them because of a situation with another relatively unknown micro-cap called GameStop, and believe you me, this big beautiful group of retards absolutely hates money. So when HOOD IPOd a couple of weeks back, I expected these retards (they call themselves apes) to be spitefully short, no matter the cost. And you know what? They're even shorter than I could have imagined - this greasy bag of shit looks like it could blow up right in these crayon-eater's faces.  \n\n\nOne thing I've noticed over the past year is squeezes seem to happen on Wednesday of the third week of the month. If you go back and look at GME and AMC, you'll see what I mean. I've been told this is because monthlies, weeklies and futures are expire on this date? So that's when most margins are called? Well guess what this week is. It's the third week of the month and that Wednesday is two days away. Making things even more interesting, HOOD, a fresh and highly-volatile IPO is set to report their first ever earnings after-hours this Wednesday.  \n\n\nThis is in no shape or form financial advice, I literally have no clue what the fuck I'm doing. Got it? Cool. Let's roll that beautiful bean footage.  \n\n\nAccording to Ortex, shorts are currently only able to borrow around 17.5 million total shares. The shorts have been at 100% utilization for the last 6 days. Is that a lot? I don't know. I know they only IPOd with 55 million shares. I have no clue if that's how many shares are currently in the public float. If it is, that's a lot (31.8%), and on par with several other current meme stonks like AMC. That said, I don't really think float matters in this case.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xytvp6szjsh71.png?width=1958&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=004300f9899d751ba6ee5613712423972fbd5cb9\n\nOrtex TLDR: All 17.5 million shares available for short-selling look to be already shorted. \n\nCross-referencing this info with Fintel, it seems to align.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wtwuunb0lsh71.png?width=1152&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1c8d42524ee30fe850264f50a0e93a5b5834922\n\n  \nAs far as I can tell, HOOD is becoming harder and harder to short making it incredibly hard to artificially deflate the price. \n\nThe other thing giant red baboon butt stat in the bunch is the Cost To Borrow Rate. Ortex has this anywhere between 46.97 and 86.47%, with an average of 66.93%\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4va6ae1zmsh71.png?width=794&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76f05783f91c1bd25fe692d0977021ed23ee4ce6\n\n66.93%...\n\nYour mom said that's really expensive. She said, \"At a 67% borrow rate, @ a $49 share price, the stock would have to drop to $16.17 per share just for these shorts to break even\". I don't know her that math works out, but if does, you probably have better odds at breeding miniature horse ducks.\n\nThat's a lot of bleeding, I'd think that means these shorts need to make their money quick.\n\nNot necessarily believing either of these garbage platforms, I decided to try and short a HOOD share myself, just to see what E-Trade told me. Here's what I got.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2h1dlh9dmsh71.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28c26aecb48b5a93665a9d1e89320c5a91b5c797\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bofdnd9dmsh71.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a97d6bf85ab15d9f6b7daf04387be58fc17b1d3\n\nAn estimated borrow rate of 48%. While that's not the 67% Ortex is touting, that's wayyyyy more than the standard 0.2 to 1% you'll find on other stocks like APPL, Z or SFIX.\n\nAnother point is the short-shares changing of hands seems to be slowing. I don't know these crayon eaters have managed to swap out 4 - 8 million short-shares while keeping utilization at 100%, but good golly they've been done doing it. Ortex and Fintel give you different numbers, but either way you cut the baby it looks like the swapping is slowing down today.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tdmmzqtoqsh71.png?width=790&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5290a8eaf88a40d96bc52b06e1abc203885c463\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d1c18stoqsh71.png?width=970&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d66800ab1017dffc68775ca856d7da23aaa8702b\n\nNow what does all this mean? No fuckin idea. My best guess, I'd think volatility will increase going into earnings, and at that high of a borrow rate with that few of shares to short available, I wouldn't think the share price needs much movement to the upside to really start squeezing some balls. I guess we'll find out.  \n\n\nTLDR: Am retarded. Help. Not in any way financial advice.",

They were told no more EUAs being issued and go for full Biologics Application License.  Not gonna lie, that shit might take a year to get the full trials and paperwork vetted.

Coupled with the recent surge in Delta variant in the US, the FDA may even revisit an EUA for them...  but that's somewhere between maybe and using hopium as lube for a wishful gain-porn circle jerk.

        "selftext": "# I. Introduction\n\nI think the **hardest part about trading is that the market is constantly evolving**. We are creatures of habit, as a result we get complacent and think we can find a single, comfortable strategy that works an infinite amount of times. This is almost never the case; different market conditions call for different approaches**.** By combining this post with my last, you should **obtain a basic understanding of how you can read market conditions, and adapt with the market.**\n\nIf you [read my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TickerWizards/comments/p24uma/follow_the_money_how_to_catch_every_rotation_and/), you now know when money is flowing into equities, and when it is flowing into bonds, the dollar and other safe havens. You also know about the different indexes, and what basket of stocks they carry. You even know about some interesting correlations that have arisen recently related to tech and a risk off rotation.\n\nIn this one - I'm going to take it a step further, and dig a little deeper, showing you all how to tell exactly which types equities money is flowing to, and **how to use that to generate high probability trades.** In this era of passive indexation, **you are almost never just buying one stock**. You are buying one stock - and every stock correlated to it. That means, **when you are buying CLOV and PLTR - you are also buying WISH, BB, AMC, UWMC and GME.** This obviously is not a category of stocks by traditional means - but in recent times it has become one. The point is - **you are going all in on one stock and you don't even realize it.**\n\nTo avoid this phenomenon - you need to understand the different different industries present within the market. Equities all belong to at least one of these - **and will usually track the rest of the stocks within their respective industry quite closely.**\n\n# II. The Eleven Sectors That Define The Market\n\nThere is generally believed to be eleven different sectors that equities belong to. In this section, I'll detail what each one is, **the ETF you can use to track it**, and what environment it usually outperforms in.\n\nAlso, there's two main categories for stocks: **cyclicals - which follow the business cycle, and non-cyclicals - which perform the same year round.**\n\n# 1 - Energy (VDE)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The energy sector is a category of stocks that relate to producing or supplying energy. The energy sector or industry includes companies involved in the exploration and development of oil or gas reserves, oil and gas drilling, and refining. The energy industry also includes integrated power utility companies such as renewable energy and coal.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\nBasically, this sector is dominated by the oil industry. You will notice renewables will hardly effect it's price movements a vast majority of the time. While many are trying to shift away from oil, it will likely be a massive part of our economy and our market long into the future.\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nIn most situations - the energy sector is cyclical. This means when our economy is doing well and expanding - it will perform well.  When it isn't, the reverse is true. Because it is dominated by a commodity, energy companies also have no issue passing on inflation to their consumers. However, keep in mind this one is a bit special because of OPEC and their ability to influence price.\n\n\"OPEC is a cartel that **aims to manage the supply of oil** in an effort to set the price of oil on the world market, in order to avoid fluctuations that might affect the economies of both producing and purchasing countries.\"\n\n*- Investopedia*\n\nBasically, they have most of the oil, and fix the prices to their liking. This can have some unforeseen effects on the market, so if you are trading energy you definitely want to monitor their movements.\n\n# 2 - Materials (VAW)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The basic materials sector is an industry category made up of businesses engaged in the discovery, development, and processing of raw materials. The sector includes companies engaged in mining and metal refining, chemical products,\u00a0and forestry products.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nThe materials sector is cyclical. It is sensitive to changes in the economy and tracks it pretty closely. This is another sector that can easily pass inflation onto their consumers due to the nature of their products. It's also going to be especially sensitive to any changes in the supply and demand of raw materials worldwide.\n\n# 3 - Industrials (VIS)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The industrial goods sector includes stocks of companies that mainly produce capital goods used in manufacturing, resource extraction, and construction. Businesses in the industrial goods sector make and sell machinery, equipment, and supplies that are used to produce other goods rather than sold directly to consumers.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\nBasically, the materials sector passes raw materials to the industrials sector - which converts them to products used to manufacture the final products passed on to consumers.\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nBecause it is so closely tied to how much companies are producing - this sector is also cyclical. This is yet another sector that can pass the costs of inflation onto their consumers. Subsequently, due to it's close ties with the materials sector - it will be especially sensitive to the supply and demand of raw materials.\n\n# 4 - Consumer Discretionary (VCR)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"Consumer discretionary is a term for classifying goods and services that are considered non-essential by consumers, but desirable if their available income is sufficient to purchase them. Examples of consumer discretionary products can include durable goods, high-end apparel, entertainment, leisure activities, and automobiles.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\nEssentially, anything broke people can't afford, like those who went all in on WISH calls before earnings, goes in this basket.\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nBecause it depends on the income of consumers - this is also a cyclical sector. When the economy is thriving, people will have more money to blow on non-essential goods, like $120 Lululemon shorts, or tickets to Disney World.\n\n# 5 -  Consumer Staples (VDC)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The term consumer staples refers to a set of essential products used by consumers. This category includes things like foods and beverages, household goods, and hygiene products as well as alcohol and tobacco. These goods are those products that people are unable\u2014or unwilling\u2014to cut out of their budgets regardless of their financial situation.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\nBasically the opposite of consumer discretionary - these are things people **NEED** not things that they **WANT.**\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nThese are non-cyclical, or defensive - which means regardless of how the economy is doing they will perform more or less the same. This means when the economy is taking a turn for the worst, they will generally outperform the other sectors. This doesn't mean they are immune to business cycle changes entirely, but they are certainly much less affected by them.\n\n# 6 - Health Care (VHT)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The healthcare sector consists of businesses that provide medical services, manufacture medical equipment or drugs, provide medical insurance, or otherwise facilitate the provision of healthcare to patients. The healthcare sector is one of the largest and most complex in the U.S. economy, accounting for close to a fifth of overall gross domestic product (GDP). The U.S. healthcare sector benefits from a strong system of medical research and development, in cooperation with the higher education system and the technology industry. The aging U.S. population and the advancing senescence of the Baby Boomer generation are driving ongoing strong demand in the healthcare sector.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nThis one is a bit complicated because there are a few industries within the sector, namely: medical equipment, drug R&amp;D, and health insurance. The sector is non-cyclical - but each industry has it's own quirks.\n\nThe drug industry in particular often moves independently of everything else on the market, because it is highly dependent on new developments and news pieces related to potentially groundbreaking treatments. Health insurance and medical equipment is usually non-negotiable regardless of the business cycle - so it will outperform in times of economic distress, and generally perform the same year round.\n\n# 7 - Financials (VFH)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The financial sector is a section of the economy\u00a0made up of\u00a0firms and institutions that provide financial services to commercial and retail customers. This\u00a0sector comprises a broad range of industries including banks, investment companies, insurance companies, and real estate firms.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nBanks involve the supply and demand of money. They make money through fees and interest rate spreads. Banks perform well during economic expansion when companies and individuals are borrowing money. One of the main drivers of borrowing/lending is interest rates. In a rising rate environment (observed through TNX, TLT, US treasury yield curve), banks will outperform. They pay short term rates (front of curve) on their deposits, and lend money to companies or individuals at a higher interest rate (further out on the curve) capturing a difference or \"spread\" on interest paid vs received. Understanding treasury yields and how they are related to the daily price movements in the financial sector is a great place to start.\n\n# 8 - Information Technology (VGT)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The technology sector is the category of stocks relating to the research, development, or distribution of technologically based goods and services. This sector contains businesses revolving around the manufacturing of electronics, creation of software, computers, or products and services relating to information technology.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\nThis one really needs no introduction.\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nThis is a bit tricky due to some correlations that have arisen from 2020 onward. For most of history - most tech stocks were cyclical. However, due to COVID, extremely low interest rates, and some other factors - these assets are now being rotated into during a risk off environment - and are seen as a safe-haven. Who knows if this will stand, but it's important to understanding when money will flow there **today.** More on this can be found in my previous post, where I go into detail on this phenomenon.\n\n# 9 - Communication Services (VOX)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The telecommunication sector is made up of companies that make communication possible on a global scale, whether it is through the phone or the Internet, through airwaves or cables, through wires or wirelessly. These companies created the infrastructure that allows data in words, voice, audio, or video to be sent anywhere in the world. The largest companies in the sector are telephone (both wired and wireless) operators, satellite companies, cable companies, and Internet service providers.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nThis is another non-cyclical sector. Whether the economy is good or bad - people aren't going to give up communicating with each other. In today's world, everyone needs a phone - even if it's a flip phone - and everyone needs internet access. One of the interesting parts of this sectors is that it is comprised of both growth names and income names. While the larger names are more consistent with dividends, the smaller names often have more room for capital appreciation and earnings growth.\n\n# 10 - Utilities (VPU)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The utilities sector refers to a category of companies that provide basic amenities, such as water, sewage services, electricity, dams, and natural gas. It is a large sector, and an important part of the U.S. economy, with a market capitalization of over $1.5 trillion (as of March 2021). Although utilities are private, for-profit companies, they are part of the public service landscape\u2014providing as they do such staples for daily living\u2014and are therefore heavily regulated. Investors typically treat utilities as long-term holdings and use them to generate a steady income for their portfolios.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nYet another non-cyclical basket of stocks. Regardless of the business cycle, demand for utilities almost always remains constant. These are some of the most stable stocks on the market - so WSB is probably better going to forget they exist moments after reading this post.\n\n# 11 - Real Estate (VNQ)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"Real estate is the land along with any permanent improvements attached to the land, whether natural or man-made\u2014including water, trees, minerals, buildings, homes, fences, and bridges. Real estate is a form of real property. It differs from personal property, which are things not permanently attached to the land, such as vehicles, boats, jewelry, furniture, and farm equipment.\"\n\n*- Investopedia*\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nLike most industries, real estate involves the supply and demand of property, both residential and commercial. Real Estate is closely related to changes in construction or development, but also heavily influenced by interest rates. Most participants are using Loan to Value (LTV), anywhere from 60-85% of the total property value; therefore, interest rate changes will impact participants' ability to borrow. Thinking through these variables, its safe to assume that real estate performs well in low interest rate environments, low-moderate commodity prices for construction, population growth, and government (both local and federal) infrastructure support. When rates rise, the debt burden increases and money is hard to borrow; which ultimately affect the ability to invest in new projects or purchase homes. \n\n# III. Practical Applications\n\nTo use all of this information - and convert it to probabilities I can use to trade - **I perform technical analysis on each sector ETF using the 1 year 1 day chart (swing trade timeframe)**. If one is breaking out of a large setup - I can assume money is going to move there in the future. If others are forming nice setups - I know to add them to my watchlist.\n\nAfter identifying a sector that is likely to become strong in the near future - **I then filter it further by finding particular stocks within the sector that have similar setups**. I usually look through the top holdings of the ETF pertaining to the sector. I do this because individual stocks are more volatile than sector ETFs and more liquid - which means there is more money to be made. If a particular stock is lagging behind the sector, it can also mean there is even more to gain than in the case of another name.\n\nYou can take this one step further and combine information from my previous posts by identifying whether we are risk on, or risk off. Cyclicals are generally going to outperform while we are risk on. Non-cyclicals will generally outperform while we are risk off.\n\n**Example -**\n\nLast week - I noticed financials were breaking out of a large falling wedge on the daily chart. This has a bullish bias - and indicates price will make a strong move in the near future. I didn't have to scan the ETF for this one, since all the stocks in it are household names.\n\n[VFH \\(Financials\\) 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/f8lboux5r5h71.png?width=2233&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d82ab4b17cc79ada84ec6e65473fd1eac870309)\n\nI also noticed BAC had formed a bull flag. This was all the information I needed to enter some October Calls which I closed today for a nice profit.\n\n[BAC \\(Financials\\) 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/fjfynyv7r5h71.png?width=2233&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67e0cb7ec1e5d05729cf3e41382c8591662a896e)\n\nLastly, ZB was trending downwards and yields were rising. This was an environment banks outperform in - which means it enforced my probability of success even more.\n\n[ZB \\(Bonds\\) 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/6wwok3sbr5h71.png?width=2233&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=596609c73c6bbfdfc01392c6262a9bb8044cb204)\n\nYou don't have to use technical analysis. This is just my preference. Many people use complex fundamental and economic analysis to determine these rotations. The important thing is understanding the environments particular sectors will outperform in.\n\n# IV. Closing Thoughts\n\nLet me first apologize for the wall of text. I'll do my best to summarize it for those with short attention spans in my TL;DR.\n\nIf you got through all of this, and my last post - hopefully you have a better understanding of tracking where money is going, and using that to make higher quality trades. I think this is a topic most of WSB doesn't know exists (or doesn't believe in) which causes them to lose lots of money because they are all in on meme stocks, and meme stocks haven't been in the rotation for a little while. That's not to say they won't ever be again - but for the time being the broader market has made all time highs almost daily whilst these names continue to puke their guts out.\n\n# V. TL;DR\n\nThere's **11 sectors** within the stock market.\n\nThey are:\n\n1. Energy **(VDE, Cyclical)**\n2. Materials **(VAW, Cyclical)**\n3. Industrials **(VIS, Cyclical)**\n4. Consumer Discretionary **(VCR, Cyclical)**\n5. Consumer Staples **(VDC, Non-Cyclical)**\n6. Healthcare **(VHT, Non-Cyclical)**\n7. Financials **(VFH, Cyclical)**\n8. Information Technology **(VGT, Cyclical Most Of The Time)**\n9. Communication Services **(VOX, Non-Cyclical)**\n10. Utilities **(VPU, Non-Cyclical)**\n11. Real Estate **(VNQ, Cyclical)**\n\nEach one will be rotated into depending on different market conditions. Understanding this is important to being able to make money at any given time. I perform technical analysis to determine when each is being rotated into, but you can use any analysis you want.",

        "selftext": "Ok my fellow smooth brains trying to compare this to the likes of $WISH, $CLOV, and $AMC. While I do love throwing money away on memes to fund the hedge fund manager's bastard son's third yatch he fucks my girlfriend on, I do also like to find something that'll make me some money in order to afford tissues to wipe my tears. One of those right now at this current price point is $CLNE.\n\nWe might think $CLNE is a meme and pump/squeeze play that famed WSB, but it is not. It got some hype because Apes got word of the low public float and saw that it had some short percentage of around 10% of public float and thought they wanted to buy cow farts that signed a deal with Amazon. So they bought the hell out of it just to watch HFs come in and short it to death from $20 to where its at now \\~$6.60. \n\nAt the current price the market cap of the company is about $1.49B making it a nice value. You might say, \"will it go moon?\". Then I'll reply, \"take the crayon out of your mouth, close your mouth when you breathe, and hold on until the end my good friend.\" \n\n$CLNE all you need to know is that they sell fuel, a special kind of fuel that is made from waste that lowers emissions. This fuel already has an infrastructure and is a cheaper and more scalable transition than other energy sources and is the only one that is carbon negative, not just carbon neutral. The company already has signed deals to distribute the fuel to companies and local governments. More recently they signed a few deals for 26M gallons which is about 25% of their quarterly numbers put out in Q2 of 2021 which increased by 13% year over year. Not only are they signing deals to provide fuel, they are also being awarded contracts to build RNG stations that are worth millions. The thing about RNG is that the existing infrastructure is limited and needs expanding. This brings me into the infrastructure bill that has allotted $30B in funding to expand renewable fuels infrastructure. $30B is 20x the current market cap, but won't all be directly awarded to $CLNE. While $CLNE is the market leader in this emerging energy space the government won't hand it out just to them to fund the actual infrastructure for it. \n\nNow we get into the value. Current market cap sits at $1.49B, best numbers I have found for total assets hover around $1B-$900M depending on the source. Total liability sits at $100M. So worst case we have a total share holder equity of $800M with TO INCLUDE DEBT! This isn't some black magic accounting scheme where they have piles of debt and turn it into assets on books to get a desirable P/B ratio. $800M equity which includes over $254M in cash and short term investments which is up 70% from last quarter. So we have an unleveraged 1.86 P/B ratio. This might not seem like much, but this is one of the only cash positive, unleveraged, and profitable small cap companies in all of energy not just renewable energy with that low of a P/B. Not to mention they are pioneering the market. \n\nSo the company looks good on the books, year over year growth, future growth and a mega catalysts in the infrastructure bill. Something that does need to be addressed was Q2 revenue numbers which is due to $79M in revenue allotted to Amazon Warrants. Without the warrants revenue would be above $79M and cost to operate would be significantly lower. \n\nThis is not just a meme stock, but it can be squeezed with 10% of public float being short, only 150M in public free float, and 2.6 days to cover. However, that is outside of the scope of the DD... but it would only take 20M in volume to do.",

That corresponds to about **$438** as a *bearish expected move* and **$446** as a *bullish expected move*.\n\n**Implied Volatility** \u2013 The VIX was lower on the week from around 18 to close Friday near 16. That is below its historical average and index/etf expected moves for the next week are tight as a result.\n\n**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)\n\n* SPY **0.8%**\n* QQQ **1.1%**\n* IWM **1.9%**\n* DIA **1%**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### In the News\n\nRobinhood (HOOD) options were listed on Wednesday and the stock joined the ranks of the meme stocks, at least for a few days. The highest strike originally listed was $70, and initially, there were only monthly expiries. As we\u2019ve seen in other meme stocks, the highest call strike becomes popular in retail, and $70 was where the stock closed on Wednesday as short gamma ran out above that level. The stock finished the week at $55. Weekly options and higher strikes have now been added (as high as $170). The $70 strike, August 20th remains the strike with the most open interest as of now.\n\nSkew to the upside is sharp, with the 55 calls expiring this week around 155 IV, while the 75 calls are around 205 IV. Translation, positions that buy nearer to the money and spread by selling OTM are favorable cost/skew. The expected move for this week is about 15%:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c84e4kfhj5g71.png?width=569&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76171e8657cee7cfb9a5724ec9496ffa2e323917\n\n### Expected Moves for Companies Reporting Earnings\n\nSome earnings of note this week include Palantir, AMC, Disney, and Coinbase.

        "selftext": "**Fundamentals**\n\nLUMN is currently trading very close to book value at between $11-12 per share as of time of writing, with earnings per share averaging about $0.40-0.50 per quarter, excluding Q4 where they took a $2 Billion Goodwill impairment. They currently pay a $0.25/share quarterly dividend, for a yield of about 8.5%. The next EX-div is on August 30.\n\nRecently LUMN announced 2 sales consisting of legacy/low-growth assets that make up approximately 20% of their $8.4-8.6B annual EBIDTA. They are giving up $1.7 Billion in EBIDTA for approximately $10.2 Billion in cash. However, if you count the $1.4 Debt that the buyer is taking on, it's effectively $11.6 Billion.\n\nIn theory, LUMN could take this $10.2 Billion in proceeds and pay out about $9 per share, covering 75% of the value of the shares, while still remaining profitable with their remaining 80% of EBIDTA and covering their $0.25/quarter dividend.\n\nHowever, Storey believes the most effective use of this capital is to invest in high-growth Fiber assets, which should grow future earnings, as well as a $1 Billion buyback program over the next 2 years in which the company will be buying shares at a discount to intrinsic value.\n\nCurrently the biggest risk LUMN faces has been their approximately $30 Billion in debt and slowly declining revenue, which is the reason the shares are trading at such a low valuation. However, they have been making a lot of progress in both paying down debt and financing it at lower rates the past couple years. In addition, the asset sale consists of their legacy assets, and they intend to focus on growth after the sale.\n\n\n**Technicals**\n\nLUMN is currently very heavily shorted, with about 10.7 days of trading to cover.  https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/LUMN/short-interest/\n\nLast time LUMN saw this level of short interest back in January, where the price temporarily shot up to about $16 during a short squeeze.\n\nFor comparison, AMC has just 0.5 days to cover.\n\nLUMN could be due for a short squeeze if the right conditions align.\n\nIn addition to the upside, the buyback program should provide some regular price support as the Company seeks good opportunities to buy back shares at a discount.\n\nPositions: 1340 Shares of LUMN",

They're both plays on catalysts the probabilities of which are impossible to quantify, but if they land in favour of the stock, can give massive returns. Sure, I believe psychedelic stocks have an ethical dimension to them and that we're hopefully contributing to something that will benefit humanity. AMC and GME are just about making money. But if I'm being honest deep down, if I didn't think I stood to make a lot of money off of investing in psychedelics, I probably wouldn't be doing it. \n\nEven though momentum is looking like it's on our side, we simply do not know what will happen in 1, 2 or 5 years.

        "selftext": "This is for canadian apes.\n\nWhile lurking on different groups, I frequently see questions from canadian apes about TFSA, RRSP and TAXES. This is no financial advice but I happen to know how those registered accounts works.\n\nThe most debated issue is about taxes in a TFSA. TFSA is a Tax Free Saving Account, meaning that any gains you make in it, is 100% yours, no tax applies. You don't have to declare anything on your tax form, nothing to add on your revenu. This is the perfect vehicule for money growth. It is so perfect that the government needs to creates rules around it. There's a limit, which is 75500$ if you're 18 since 2009 and also considered a canadian resident by the CRA since 2009.\n\nIf you go over, they charge you 1% on the exceeding amount monthly, which is a lot. Keep in mind they are not up to date. Financial institutions informs the CRA 1 to 2 times a year, \n\nmeaning that the CRA is never really up to date on your exact contribution unused amount, it's up to you to make sure you don't go over. Every amount that you withdraw from your TFSA+your unused contribution amount, you can contribute next year. That means, if I contribute 10000$ in my TFSA and still have 65500$ unused amount, and my 10000$ makes 1M$ and I withdraw it, next year, I'll have a 1 065 000$ as a contribution ceiling.\n\nThe CRA considers someone that day trades(makes a lot of transactions) in a TFSA, a business and tax him/her accordingly.\n\nThere's no exact number on how many transactions you need to do to be considered a business. Every year, the CRA randomly audit a specific demographic group, for example, in a given year, they canexamine and validate all the tax form from a specific work space (medical space worker, restaurant workers, etc). That, and also people that withdraw HUGE amount from their TFSA (apes having made 1000000% in GME/AMC).\n\nIf they can prove that you were day trading, so using capital gains to reinvest and make more capital gains, they could consider you as a business and tax you. It's actually easy for an ape to show that you are not a business,\n\nby proving you are employed, you are long on most of your position, etc. \n\nI also heard people saying that you pay taxes because they are US equities. RRSP is considered as a fiduciary company, a pension, and is covered by a treaty between USA and Canada and this \n\ntreaty says you don't pay any tax on your capital gains, or any other kind or revenus. The only difference you find in your TFSA, is that if you hold equities that gives you dividends, thoses dividends have a tax withhodling from USA\n\nof 30%, or 15% if you have sign the Form W-8BEN (Certificate for United States Tax Withholding and reporting), which most canadian brokerages makes you sign when opening the account. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry if nobody cares lol, thought it would be helpful to canadian apes...",
