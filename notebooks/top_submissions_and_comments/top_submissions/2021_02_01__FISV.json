        "selftext": "**TL;DR:**\n\n**1. Check all of your credit and debit cards for fraudulent charges. There are reports of a tidal wave of fraudulent charges across different banks and payment networks.**\n\n**2. Let's get to the bottom of this and buy the puts that will send us to Valhalla. Currently, there is no mainstream reporting of these fraud charges. I have puts on BBVA, FIS, and FISV**\n\nAgain, check all of your debit cards and credit cards for unauthorized transactions. Some of the more common ones are \"coloadtest,\" \"Angela Singleton,\" Spotify, \"sumup,\" \"wfxb,\" and \"amzn\\[.\\]com.\" Report the transactions as fraudulent so that your card gets locked instead of simply disputing the charge.\n\n# Tidal wave of fraud charges\n\nIn the links below, you will find pages of people reporting small and large fraudulent transactions.  I've read 300+ comments of affected people. Many of them note that customer service has told them that a lot of other people are disputing similar fraud charges. Moreover, these charges are bizarre in their diversity of payment networks, banks, and \"workarounds\" that they use. E.g. Some fraudulent charges are on prepaid gift cards. Some fraudulent charges are on cards that were cancelled, re-sent, and fraudulently charged while still in the mail. Some fraudulent charges posted to cards that were closed (possibly by manipulating a recurring charge mechanism). Below are links to some of the data points, I broke the links because my previous submissions were autospammed, sorry. There is also a table below where I summarized some of the data before I got tired of data entry.\n\nMost data: *doctorofcreditDOTcom/widespread-unauthorized-transactions-check-your-accounts-coloadtest-com-sumup/*\n\n[reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lnb1yq/coloadtestcom\\_charge/](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lnb1yq/coloadtestcom_charge/)\n\n[reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/lms5u5/unrecognized\\_charge\\_from\\_coloadtestcom/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/lms5u5/unrecognized_charge_from_coloadtestcom/)\n\n[reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/lmdbq9/my\\_bank\\_account/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/lmdbq9/my_bank_account/)\n\n[reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/lppyi3/reports\\_of\\_widespread\\_unauthorized\\_card/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/lppyi3/reports_of_widespread_unauthorized_card/)\n\ndoctorofcreditDOTcom/al-fl-tx-az-co-ca-nm-bbva-select-credit-card-500-bonus/\n\n*bogleheadsDOTorg/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=340580&amp;p=5827773*\n\n*early-retirementDOTorg/forums/f27/unauthorized-charge-from-coloadtest-com-108007.html*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This is only from the more recent data on the doctorofcredit link](https://preview.redd.it/aov4c1axz9j61.png?width=1798&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=520608861f616b63a254c98b9e587ecce19c8a7a)\n\nCollaborator [u/Wise\\_Hope\\_3654](https://www.reddit.com/u/Wise_Hope_3654/) made this spreadsheet for the Reddit data points: megaDOTnz/file/bggQxARK#haADas8e1JTmMKufpzXWM6RgHn7fR3I-d27Ec4nrYPg\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo summarize the table, almost all major credit card issuing banks and almost all major credit card payment networks have been hit. Mastercard has been maybe less affected. Some cards have only been used once. One card was never used. Some cards were gift cards. Some cards were cancelled and then charged when a new card was sent but before it was received in the mail.\n\nOne of the most interesting leads is the commenter who said this data is being shared on the dark web and he got that from a source called idx (I have no idea what that is).\n\n**Inferences:**\n\n1. This was probably not an attack on a retailer's database because many cards were only used once.\n2. This was probably not an attack on issuing banks since so many were affected. One possible exception is BBVA, since their cards were the victims of the earliest attacks and have been attacked in relatively large quantity.\n3. Likewise, Amex and Visa are more sus than other payment networks, but still not high on the list of suspects.\n4. Some agent that many banks and payment networks use is the most likely culprit. This could be a software vendor. It could be a faulty pipeline to a credit report company (TransUnion, Equifax, Experian) that is adding payment info.\n5. This breach is deep in the system if they are able to hit cards that are ostensibly locked and that are being sent in the mail after the first is cancelled.\n6. Likewise, this is probably not a stale breach from long ago since the fraudsters are able to update their card info to these newly mailed cards.\n7. Many are reporting the same fraudulent charges e.g. coloadtest, Angela Singleton, cfxb, and sumup, so we know these are part of the same breach or set of breaches by the same hacker.\n8. The sumup charges are being sent to Brazil. That's a good place for international financial crimes since Brazil does not extradite citizens.\n\n# Suspicions\n\nI think the most likely source of the quantity and variety of breached cards is a deep attack on a \"acquirer processor.\" An acquirer is the bank that handles the transaction for the merchant. Merchant acquirers are the banks that handle transaction risk. Acquirer processors actually process the transactions. Some banks do both, for example, Chase (JPM). Some banks do not, for example Wells Fargo (WFC), hands off the processing to Fiserv (FISV).\n\nA processor is the most likely to be able to generate the kind of data needed for this attack. They would see data from across many banks and payment networks. They would have the ability to collect new card data after reissues and data from cards that were never used. In the 2011 hack of FIS, the hackers were able to get into prepaid debit card (vanilla gift card) data. That hack led to a sustained 35% downturn in the FIS stock price; I suspect a similar breach will do the same.\n\nkrebsonsecurityDOTcom/2013/06/fdic-2011-fis-breach-worse-than-reported/\n\nI collected data below from people who only ever used their card at a very small number of retailers to get a sense of which acquirer processor is most likely to have been hacked, The data is unfortunately not very conclusive.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/65ya90kc2aj61.png?width=2281&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51aadd82f159f196b5ccc483901f4878abcec3b3\n\nThere's also a possibility that there were multiple breaches and these attacks are being mixed to obscure the origin.\n\n**I'm hoping some of you know more about the innards of the payment network system or legacy software that banks use to support it. I'm hoping that we can put together a case for a most likely suspect company and make a killing with our early DD.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Positions:**\n\nI have a small quantity of OTM puts in BBVA, FIS, and FISV. I'm not ready to YOLO the account until I have more confidence the right targets are selected.\n\n**Edit 1:**\n\na. Be sure to check out the comments below on a potential BIN attack.\n\nb. I got in contact with Angela of the photography business that is supposedly charging some of the payments. They haven't compromised her accounts and are just posing as her so she has no info.",

        "selftext": "This is my first DD post on any company, be gentle.\n\nDisclaimer: I am long RKT. This is not financial advice, and I am not receiving any compensation whatsoever from anyone for this post. I\u2019m not a professional, I\u2019m not even an amateur, this is a Wendy\u2019s.\n\nSources used: RKT investor relations website and company website, RKT earnings transcripts, SEC fillings, the SEC EDGAR database, sea king al pha, whalewisdom, finbox, yahoo finance, stockcharts, openinsider, Zacks, google sheets.\n\n\u200b\n\nSummary\n\nRocket Companies (RKT) is a fintech company that operates several brands including the flagship Rocket Mortgage. I think RKT presents an opportunity to buy serious value at a cheap price, because the market has not priced in the underlying fact that RKT is a tech company akin to Square, Paypal, etc.\n\nRKT has disrupted the lending industry and has embraced a fully digital ecosystem, which will continue to drive customer acquisition and retention in the future\nRKT spends considerable money and resources on UX/UI development, client experience, and marketing. This will also help drive their continued expansion into the lending market.\nThe RKT \u201cecosystem\u201d provides a \u201cfull cycle\u201d solution for everything related to real estate transactions and insurance. They serve real estate professionals looking to generate leads, develop those leads, better serve their clients, and make every stage of real estate transactions smoother. From the client side, they similarly just make everything easier - it\u2019s an app, it\u2019s online, it\u2019s doable from home and it\u2019s not complicated. There\u2019s an inherent advantage in what they\u2019re doing here because closing on real estate transactions has always been something that\u2019s complex, unpleasant, expensive, and not well understood. You need lawyers, you need agents, there\u2019s a ton of paperwork, it sucks. RKT is changing all of that.\nRKTs balance sheet, income, and liabilities support a stock price several times higher than the current one in my opinion.\nRKT is currently stagnant in price, and the market appears to be pricing it like a traditional mortgage company, not a rapidly growing tech company (which they are).\nRKT has been around for decades (skips the startup costs that will provide barrier to entry for newer companies looking to do what they\u2019re doing), but somehow seems to still be leading the tech charge in the industry. That\u2019s a unique and potent combination in my opinion.\nRKT needs a catalyst to get the market to value it as a tech company instead of a lending company. Once that happens, and I expect it to sometime within the next year, RKT should approach an appropriate valuation such as 20x earnings. That\u2019s an estimate I pulled out of nowhere, but is commensurate with the low end of P/E ratios for companies I see as similar to RKT.\nKey Point - RKT is Priced Like a Legacy Mortgage Company\n\nThe average estimate for 2020 year end revenue is $15 billion, and the yearly earnings estimate average is $3.85 per share.\n\nThis estimate gives a ttm P/E ratio of just over 5.5. The sector median is something like 8-12, which makes RKT cheaply valued relative to the earnings it produces, even compared to the financial/mortgage sector. What\u2019s key here is, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s really an appropriate comparison. I would place them more in line with companies like Square (ttm P/E ratio of 325x lol), PayPal (ttm P/E ratio of 69x, nice), or Fiserv (ttm P/E ratio of 24x). I used Zacks for all of these P/E ratio lookups.\n\nLet\u2019s assume RKT is conservatively worth 15x earnings, and that it hits the estimate of $3.85 eps. That would put its fair value right now at $57.75 per share. I think it\u2019s worth more than that but, we all should do well to remember that it\u2019s really only worth whatever the market will pay for it.\n\nKey Point - Catalysts\n\nThis thing needs a catalyst. Right now I am loading up. I\u2019m buying shares, I\u2019m selling SHORT TERM covered calls to reduce basis on those shares, but I will be stopping the sale of those covered calls within a couple weeks most likely. The Q4 earnings announcement will be on 2/25. I am not sure that the actual earnings numbers will be enough to wake this thing up, although I expect them to be good. But if that announcement comes with discussion of their focus for 2021 and beyond, and gets the market thinking about them as a tech company first and mortgage lending company second, things will start to heat up. I don\u2019t know when the real catalyst will hit that triggers the run-up, but I think it could start with the Q4 earnings call. I am looking at $21 as the floor for this stock, and I expect the price to double within a year. I will be acquiring OTM LEAPs, expiring next spring.\n\nSupporting information and background follows.\n\nThe Business\n\nRKT is in the business of providing solutions to financial transactions, including mortgage origination and refinancing, auto lending, and more. Specific subsidiaries and my simplistic view of how they interact:\n\nHome Financing\n\nRocket Mortgage - The mortgage company. This is a prominent \u201cpublic facing\u201d part of the Rocket ecosystem.\nAmrock - Amrock provides title insurance, property valuations, and other solutions. I see this as \u201csupporting infrastructure\u201d to keep clients within the rocket ecosystem where they would otherwise need to go elsewhere and is part of what makes RKT a one-stop-shop.\nAmrock Title Insurance (ATI) Company - basically does underwriting for Amrock. The \u201cbusiness end\u201d in my simple understanding of the world.\nNexsys - provides a streamlined approach to the closing process with their Clear Sign and Clear HOI technologies - taking care of closing day authentications and sharing of homeowners insurance information.\nLendesk - Lendesk specifically provides solutions for the mortgage market in Canada\nEdison Financial - Basically the \u201cfront end\u201d of Lendesk that Canadian clients would interact with.\nHome Sale and Search\n\nRocket Homes - Rocket Homes is a proprietary home search platform and real estate agent referral network. Basically this matches buyers, sellers, and agents, and is a key aspect of keeping clients completely working within RKT for all aspects of real estate buying/selling/financing.\nFor Sale By Owner - A digital marketplace designed to let clients buy and sell real estate on their own. I think it\u2019s absolutely brilliant that RKT owns this, but more on that later.\nAuto &amp; Personal Financing\n\nRocket Auto - Supports rental and online car purchasing platforms.\nRocket Loans - online personal loan solutions for clients.\nMedia\n\nCore Digital Media - a major advertiser in the mortgage, financial, insurance, and education sectors.\nLower My Bills - this company is basically a \u201cportal\u201d business model that connects people with providers of various loan and insurance products.\nServices &amp; Technology Development\n\nRock Connections - Basically a sales and support platform that handles appointments, prequalifications, generating leads, and data analysis among other things.\nRock Central - I will generalize this as \u201cbusiness support\u201d. HR, administration, etc.\nRocket Innovation Studio - A tech incubator to gather and engage top talent and ideas.\nRecent Acquisitions\n\nRKT, through Lendesk, acquired Finmo back in October of 2020 (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-companies-subsidiary-acquires-fast-182042594.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALnvnNBoglSnmMP0O61AqgXBJokNS53LjJYuG3NvYKhayp4I6ZH2RpfmFUbSsCAU4xmnBNGMTwiEG-Ly29EabVy1-OjPIGfkYoQ3389gn3Edebs9sIwWOy1tPzqjRwOwwGA_PWg0cNzEFCe7HBTilMwADUT_y0QxWw8vizWecGcv) Finmo is a rapidly growing Canadian digital mortgage platform and this acquisition I think was perfect - it shows RKTs dedication to embracing a fully digital experience, and making sure they\u2019re the ones leading that charge.\n\nManagement\n\nI do not have much to say here, aside from this. The RKT team is not the new kids on the block, they have decades of industry experience. Also, I value leaders that make people feel valued. And on that note, under CEO Jay Farner Quicken Loans has been in the top 30 of Fortune\u2019s \u201c100 Best Companies to Work For\u201d list for 17 consecutive years.\n\nFinancials and Growth\n\nWhen it comes to the numbers, RKT is killing it. I don\u2019t want to just spout a bunch of numbers that anyone can easily go look up so here\u2019s a couple that stood out to me from the Q3 earnings announcement and related data:\n\n$4.63 billion in revenue, which is 163% YoY growth.\n\nFrom that revenue, they beat EPS estimates with $1.21 for the quarter vs $1.09 expected.\n\nNet income was $2.4 billion which represents a YoY growth of 365%.\n\nClosed loan volume YoY growth was 122% to $89B.\n\nNet rate lock volume was $94.7 Billion (101% growth).\n\nRKT has brought in $13.1 billion in revenue in the first 3 quarters and seems to be on track to close out Q4 with yearly revs above $15 billion.\n\nThat\u2019s awesome but what I really like is that they pair this amazing growth with $3.5B cash on hand. That\u2019s great because I want them to be able to scale as they grow, and make acquisitions as needed (see Finmo) to ensure they can keep that growth going without getting overextended and failing to capitalize.\n\nRKTs ability to recapture clients is one of the keys to their future success in my uneducated opinion. Their recapture rate is 4.6x the industry average. The Q3 earnings transcript includes a statement by the CEO on how when interest rates fall, retention rate falls, refinance activity is larger. The high recapture rate RKT has serves as a natural hedge to their retention of existing clients because their recapture is so much higher than average in the industry.\n\nQuick aside - RKT announced a $1 billion share buyback program. They\u2019ll be able to repurchase shares from time to time starting Nov10 2020, ending in two years. I don\u2019t love the idea of share buybacks because I think this can be detrimental to actual business growth for the sake of shareholder value. However, with the large cash position RKT has (and it doubled from December 2019 to September 2020) I think this is a reasonable way to deploy some of that cash for now.\n\nOk so what about valuation using DCF, free cash flow analysis, something like that? Honestly I\u2019m not convinced this is as useful as some people make it out to be. It\u2019s nice to know what the numbers indicate, but I don\u2019t spend a lot of time worrying about an exact price target based on anything like this. That said, you can crunch the numbers yourself or check out something like the Finbox resources:\n\nhttps://finbox.com/NYSE:RKT/models/dcf-growth-exit-5yr\n\nI don\u2019t believe that fair value estimate for an instant, but it's a part of the puzzle to consider. Finbox has various models you can check out, but it\u2019s also just a nice place to view aggregate data other than directly from the SEC filings.\n\nProduct Channels\n\nRKTs direct-to-consumer channel is their main source of revenue right now, but I think they will be successful in their efforts to grow their partner channels as well. Why do I say that? Numbers don\u2019t lie:\n\nDirect-to-consumer Q3 growth: 131% YoY ($53.5B closed loan volume)\nPartner Network growth 127% YoY ($29.6B closed volume)\nAdjusted Revenue for Partner Network is up 502% YTD vs 2019 ( see Q3 earnings transcript)\nThe partner network volume is a little over half of the direct-to-consumer volume but the growth rate is just so damn juicy. That revenue growth is hellathicc.\n\nCurrent Market and outlook\n\nRight now, rates are low. The average 30-yr mortgage fixed rate is 2.92% (https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/mortgage-refinancing-surges-but-high-home-prices-stop-buyers.html)\n\nI cannot say how long interest rates will remain low but I believe RKT is positioned to continue to grow regardless of what rates do moving forward. They just cover so much of the space, and they do it with a focus on applied technology.\n\nHere\u2019s some blatant speculation. I think as we move into 2021 and the vaccine becomes more prevalent, millennials will buy, sell, and borrow against real estate with renewed intensity. I think RKT is uniquely positioned to capture that market.\n\nPositions: RKT shares. Cost basis of $21.14.",

        "selftext": "Been holding $135 leap calls since $92, playing weeklies for the short term trades, and it\u2019s only gonna get better as it has for me. Here\u2019s a little of my own DD.\n\nThere is So much to talk about. But, the First Data deal made Fiserv a powerhouse in payment processing and digital payments when they took over Clover. This market has three main pillars:\nPoint of sales (POS) terminals\nPeer-to-peer (P2P) payments\nE-commerce solutions\n  Being a leader in any one of these categories should make Fiserv a $100 billion company. Its current value is $70 billion. But Fiserv is now the largest POS provider and P2P payment processor... And the company is going to use its expansive network to quickly build out its new omnichannel e-commerce solution.\nA leader in all three of these categories has the potential to be well over a $300 billion company. FISV is partnered with Zelle, does more payments than PYPL\u2019s Venmo and SQ  CashApp. PYPL has a market cap of 278 billion as of last Friday. If FISV can get to $100 billion it should put its PT at $150 and that\u2019s very low ball. Their margins are going to continue to grow and if they just matched PYPL market cap, it would put them over $300 a share. There are several potential catalysts as far as buy backs, earnings, etc. \n\nAs I mentioned above, Clover is bigger than Square, yet is only part of FISV business, and the two go after different markets. Clover (generally) works with bigger businesses. Over 90% of Clover customers process over $125,000 in payments annually. Only 65% of Square\u2019s customers transact that much. Not trying to bash SQ, only showing that FISV has a lot of catching up to do as it is still trailing SQ market cap by 30 Billion. \n\nThe difference between Zelle and PYPL\u2019s Venmo and SQ (cash app) is that Zelle is backed by multiple large institutions like Chase, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bank, and Capital One. The traditional financial institutions basically joined together to build a network so they wouldn\u2019t be outdone by the likes of Venmo or Cash App. The advantage is that all of the financial institutions involved\nin Zelle are marketing the P2P service to their customers and it\u2019s only going to grow. Fintech will be one of the hottest sectors going forward and FISV will be the leader. No reason why FISV isn\u2019t at least $150-200 by EOY. Earnings 2/9. Don\u2019t miss this undervalued STRONG company.",

        "selftext": "First of all, I can't wait to be berated in the comments. \n\nI'm gonna be blunt, I have seen a whole lot of dumb shit over the last week.  A lot more than normal.  And compounding all of that is an unprecedented amount of legitimate emotional involvement here.  So let me get started by saying outright that people getting emotionally involved with trading stocks always lose.  Short, long, whatever.  It doesn't matter if you're a 19 year old throwing in your life savings or Bill fucking Ackman not being able to admit he was wrong with Herbalife.  Letting your emotions be a major factor in trading is a fantastic way to lose money. \n\nAnd a whole lot of you are really emotionally involved with this GME, AMC, whatever.\n\nTo the point: I am not making a buy/sell/hold/whatever recommendation.  I have no special insight in to what's happening with GME or whatever else.  What I can tell you is that it is for sure not worth $300.\n\nSo let's dispel one quick thing: this is not David vs Goliath.  It also isn't the little man vs hedge funds or WSB vs big finance.  It might have started out that way, but if you only read one thing [read this](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-29/reddit-traders-on-robinhood-are-on-both-sides-of-gamestop): \n\n&gt;Many of the big retail brokerages, including Robinhood, route a lot of their customer orders to Citadel Securities, so it ends up seeing a large percentage of retail trades in U.S. stocks. It can see if retail traders are mostly buying or mostly selling or mostly pretty balanced. You might expect\u2014I certainly expected\u2014to see that retail traders were buying more than they were selling this week. The stock seemed to be rocketing up on frenzied retail sentiment, and the posters on WallStreetBets were all claiming that they would never sell and keep buying until it hit $1,000.\n\n&gt;But here\u2019s what Citadel Securities\u2019 retail flow looked like in GameStop this week: 1\n\n&gt;[Graphic here](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i9SnRzR8AM1c/v0/800x-1.png)\n\n\n&gt;Retail investors were net buyers on Monday but net sellers for the rest of the week (through yesterday), and all in all quite balanced: About 49.8% of retail orders (that Citadel Securities saw) were to buy, and 50.2% were to sell.\n\n&gt;What do you make of that? One reading would be: \u201cRetail investors on Reddit might have started the GameStop rally, but they\u2019re not piling into this stock now, and the price action this week is coming from professionals.\u201d Or as one Twitter user put it, \u201cpast the retail ignition, the rocket ship was mostly intra-fast money warfare.\u201d\n\n\n\nSo, just to be clear about this, there is massive institutional money on both sides of this trade, and retail is a toddler sitting at the world series of poker.  \n\n**Understand that melvin does not need to cover in the way a retail trader needs to cover**.  \nYou, and everyone else, have no idea what Melvin's position looks like, and they can reorganize and exit a position before you ever knew it happened.  You don't know how hedged they are, you don't know what their collateral looks like, and you don't know if they've covered and restructured a short at last week's prices.  You simply don't know.  You only know what's been presented in the news, which is almost certainly bullshit.  \n\nThis thing could come to an end as fast as it started and you won't know what happened for weeks.  You might go take a shit at 1pm today and come back to GME trading at $16 because Ken Griffin got on CNBC and announced they restructured their short at an average price of $200, and were happy to sit on it.  Make no mistake, you'll get kicked in the nuts and have your ball taken away faster than you can comprehend.    \n\n**Emotions**\nThe problem with this whole \"strike back at wall street\" narrative is that lots of you are getting really worked up over this trade.  Losing money sucks, but losing money and feeling like you got shit on by the big guy is going to hurt.  This isn't a moral crusade to them, it's 25 billion dollars.  So if you're out here putting money and emotions on the line that you can't afford to lose there won't be a happy ending. \n\nWant to fight the good fight against wall street? Write your congressman, Tweet AOC or Ted Cruz, get you a fucking picket sign and go wave it around on the streeet.  But dropping money on GME that you need in life ain't gonna change anything except your net worth.\n\nTLDR: \n\n1) know and understand who is playing this game.  And that they have access to tools, leverage, and markets that you do not.  You're playing Le Chiffre at Casino Royale right now, you might think you're James Bond but there's a good chance that you're just the fat dude in the corner. \n\n2) Short squeezes end fast.  As fast as they started.  If you're new to trading then understand buying GME at this price can mean all of your money will evaporate before you had time to make a TikTock about it.\n\n3) Get your emotions out of play here.  This whole nonsense political narrative is only going to cause you to make trading mistakes.  Can't handle that?  then maybe it's not a good idea to sit at this table.  \n\nLastly, if you really just can't get yourself out of the whole \"fight the hedge funds\" nonsense, at least understand that you're spending money that you likely won't get back.  If that's worth it to you then have at it.  But don't fool yourself  in to thinking otherwise.\n\n**E: Completely unrelated**: I hate reddit awards, reddit doesn't need your money.  Go buy like a hundredth of a share of VTI or something.",

In 1980, a rule change by the government destroyed the corner.  #silverthursday.\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday\n\n&gt;Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers\u2019 attempt to corner the market on the metal.\n\n-\n&gt;Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926\u20132014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers\u2019 Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.\n\n-\n&gt;By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged\u2014March 27\u2014silver fell to $10.80, the metal\u2019s biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, \u201cA billion dollars isn\u2019t what it used to be,\u201d the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.\n\n-\n&gt;To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978\u201391) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.",

        "selftext": "We\u2019re not. Plain and simple. Anyone who frequents WSB knows this. \n\nThis means whatever media source is indicating this to be the case is a sellout and their credibility should be in serious question since they either 1) don\u2019t do their due diligence, or 2) are okay with getting their strings pulled to be used as tools by the wealthy to manipulate masses.\n\nIf there was any doubt of these hedge fund\u2019s influence and manipulate, this whole \u201cWSB going silver\u201d just put that conspiracy theory to rest and only does more to confirm that the game has always been rigged against the average person.\n\n\n\n**Edit:** You know what would be AMAZING?? This was an idea already thrown out there, but if the mods could use twitter (and by pinning a statement on this subreddit) to invalidate the silver BS... That would be SUCH a great fucking move. Maybe a message like **\"There is no sentiment among WSB members to buy SLV stock and the little that exists is under scrutiny of WSB members\"**. That would just slam the door on any sources propagating that false information and call them out on their BS (because it's just so obviously untrue). It would also make it clear for those checking the credibility of this fake news that the silver hype is a fabrication by variables outside of WSB and inform them of how convenient it is for hedge funds if people pulled from GME, and supported a stock they own massive shares of.\n\nThis goes without saying that I'm holding GME till the very end. Given how the media and some brokerages have gotten involved (and in a not so subtle way that benefits the hedge funds), it's not even about the money anymore. And that's coming from someone with student loans who stands to profit by exiting right now. Money comes and goes, but getting to witness firsthand just how rigged the system is and knowing **who's** involved in keeping people in line is just something you can't put a price tag on.",

        "selftext": "# Remember hedge funds have the weak hand\n\nThey had to realise gains from other investments just to cover losses from GME. Thursday and Friday were the days with the biggest deleveraging sisnce March 2020. Each day they have to pay high interest just to mantain the short positions, and you know what? Every time they realise gains to cover losses their performance gets worse, and this makes them look like idiots in front of their clients, putting their business in danger.\n\n# Expect some crazy volatility\n\nRemember you are playing against hedge funds, they are not going to give you free money. There is no free money in the stock market. GME investors hit them hardly, and for them is not just about losses but they have to proof to their clients that they cannot be beaten by a bunch of redditors. They may suppress the price or manipulate it. There are some excellent posts on this sub about how they manipulate the stock price (ladder attacks, MSM misinformation, etc).\n\n# Manage your risk\n\nI hold GME since $20s. For me right now there is no risk in holding the stock because it will never go back to that level. If you just bought at $300 have in mind they may be able to supress the price for days or weeks to $100-$200 level, so you must be able to stomach this volatility. I would recommend only investing money you can afford to lose to not panic sell if you see this wild volatily.\n\nThe important thing as an investor is to hold, more than to buy like crazy.\n\n# Be a critical thinker, do your DD\n\nThere is nothing that the MSM wishes more than to see loss porn from retail investors to say \"see, they didn't know what they were doing\". Please, don't give them the opportunity to say that.\n\nDo your DD, check user history whenever you read something to make sure users are no hedge fund trolls. Hedge funds are now trying to focus you attention on everything except GME. The Silver play is a trap. Citadel is long silver. \n\n# BEWARE THAT IF YOU BUY SILVER, you are helping Citadel to cover losses with their gains and give them the chance to fight on GME.\n\nMaybe mods should ban silver posts as lots of people could potentially lose money on that play.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR:\n\nDO YOUR OWN DD. BE CRITICAL.\n\nHOLD. THEY HAVE THE WEAK HAND, NOT YOU.\n\nBEWARE OF SILVER.\n\nFor SEC minions reading this: this is not investment advice.\n\nEdit 1: many thanks for the awards guys.\n\nEdit 2: WSJ and Bloomberg are pushing the silver narrative and creating the impression that somehow people here are coordinated which is complete false. Also Citadel is long silver and it seems posts are being created mainly by bots. I definitely think mods should take action.\n\nEdit 3: about silver, it is not my call, I am just sharing my point of view, I totally get the people who says nothing should be banned. Just have in mind MSM are depicting WSB as a group of organized investors that are colluding to target different assets, which is completely false. Should their message gets acceptance because of SLV they could try to ban this sub. So I think mods should at least check if those posts are legit, and if they comply with the rules. Nothing else.",

I'm a pants-on-head wearing retard and have possibly missed key points that would contradict my statements. Invest at your own risk.**\n\n**And yes, I own GME.**\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs we've been seeing this weekend, multiple bots have been hard pushing silver. At almost exactly the same time as this happened (EOD Friday) it was announced that SLV and futures were rising rapidly due to the 'Reddit mob' even though the vast majority of retail has no way to trade on weekends or touch futures.\n\nThis is obviously because no one has jumped on silver. Or at least not retail. The banks sure do love silver, and so do the boys at Shitadel. Shitadel is the fifth largest holder, along with several large banks.\n\n**Their strategy is probably something like this:**\n\nThey are running out of ammunition and their investors are scared. They love to hedge with commodities, and because they and their investors are scared now is the time to stock up. They've bought out most major suppliers and at the same time pushed the narrative that it was done by Reddit. Why?\n\nBecause they don't want people to know they're scared. They don't want people to know they are losing and buying commodities. This is their hedge, this is their attempt to cover their losses. They want to stock up on silver, but when they do that in large numbers the tickers and futures will spike. How do they explain that without giving away their position? \"Reddit did it.\"\n\nAfter they cause silver to spike in a meaningful way, they need someone to sell it off to. They've artificially created demand for silver and prevented suppliers from being able to sell to retail, and now it's trending on social media and boomer media. So what's the next step? How will they sell? Later on, they will push the silver narrative once more even harder, blaming Reddit for trying to collapse the dollar (because let's be real we fucking love clout) and all of the suppliers will suddenly have large amounts of silver available again for Reddit to get their hands on.\n\nThey want to egg you on, show you the proof by raising silver prices, and then sell it to you and line their pockets with your cash. Artificially raising the price and then selling it off the moment they can. There's a phrase for this but I think it keeps getting my posts removed.\n\nAnyone you see pushing SLV, AG, and physical silver is either heavily misinformed, a(u)(r)tistic beyond all belief, or paid off by a bank.\n\nYes, silver is heavily shorted. No, Reddit will not win a commodity war. Banks control actual physical supply lines, not just paper shares. There is no beating them at this game. People have tried and all but disappeared for it, multiple times.\n\nIf you want to ride their rise of silver then by all means go for it, but be aware that it is not retail investors causing this to rise. It is likely the people that need more ammo for this next week: Banks and HFs.\n\n\\-------------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\ude80 G\ud83d\ude80M \ud83d\ude80E\ud83d\ude80\n\nTL;DR\n\nBanks are blaming a spike in silver futures on Reddit to hide their own hedging, and are shilling silver here so that when it becomes available for purchase retail will pay a premium to 'get in' on a short that doesn't exist. Retail lines their pockets with money, and they get to empty their mansions of all the silver they hoarded.",

This might be the reason why some brokers are now removing your sell orders, because by removing your sell order, they can lend your shares to the shorters (without you realizing). \n\nPut your sell limit orders at $4K - $5K, or tell your broker to stop lending your shares out. \n\nThere is debate whether or not putting sell limit orders will stop brokers from lending out shares.

        "selftext": "So there's a lot of controversy going on regarding the idea of a silver squeeze. After what happened with gamestop, I'm convinced that this shit really might work out. On the other hand there are a lot of people thinking that this is just something to draw attention away from GME and withdraw fund from the stock. Let me assure you this is not my attention. And if you're all about GME I suggest reading here because it's a waste of time.\n\nI personally think that slv really might be the next big thing that could work out. Therefore I'd suggest to not go against the idea generally. Keep your hands at gamestop as long as you want, but once work is done, get together into this next big thing.\n\n\\*\\*Here's what happens or might happen:\\*\\*About the theory of the silversqueeze. Can't really be compared to the GME squeeze as it is not about squeezing out hedgefunds shortsellers in particular. The idea is that the silver price is priced way too low for the amount of silver that physically exists. The silvermarket volume on paper (exchanges/Futures..) is 250 times bigger than the supply of physical silver (just read this and didn't do my own DD if numbers are correct). The Idea is that a physical shortage will be caused and this would really let slv skyrocket with all that derivatives that are not backed. Now imagine some 7 million apes and the following retail investors that come after suddenly plunger the physical silver market...\n\nExample: Let's assume there is a shortage and Person A wants physical delivery of the future he bought. Person B as the seller needs to deliver 5000 ounces of silver. If supply is short, the person buys another future from Person C in order to be able to deliver the slv needed. You understand the reaction this causes.\n\nAlso the silver market is said to be manipulated and kept low for a long time. I have no opinion on this.\n\n\\*\\*What happened on the weekend?\\*\\*Silver already surged 20% since friday morning which was most likely a result of the news of \"Wallstreetbets taking over silver\" and \"Shortage in silver supply\".example: [https://twitter.com/bitpanda/status/1356023060814585859](https://twitter.com/bitpanda/status/1356023060814585859)Also I noticed several locals stores and online stores being sold out completely on silver and it looks like this is not only regarding a few small dealers.[https://www.theepochtimes.com/reddit-forum-sparks-physical-silver-shortage-on-major-dealers-websites\\_3679079.html](https://www.theepochtimes.com/reddit-forum-sparks-physical-silver-shortage-on-major-dealers-websites_3679079.html)Also social media generates a lot of heat.\n\nSo it look's like it's happening - if we're heading to a global shortage, prices could absolutely go to the moon and this is a big time chance to be with it at the beginning right now. Additionally there is a good chance that shortsellers have learnt from what was happening with GME and they might get out of their short positions earlier which will generate further momentum.\n\n**What you can do** in order to participate and make this work:It does not help the cause if you buy mining companys (even though it might generate good income). But still, in order moon the prices, you'll need to invest physically. The options are:\\* Buying silver futures and let it physically deliver. Only possible if you can easily invest some 150k.\\* Buying slv or pslv if you live at the hamburgers, and for instance \"Xtrackers physical silber\" if you're from Europe. It's really important that you check if the fund needs to fully physically cover it's assets (=buy silver). Because not all do so.\\* The next option is to physically buy silver at your local store or webshop.\\* At last, you can buy options. Your counterpart might want to hedge the positions and therefore will potentially be covered. This is also obviously the part where you can win big time (or lose everything). My weapon of choice is:  34.00C expiring in April\n\nI prefer a mix of above.\n\nBut as we all know, I'm just another ape sharing brainfarts, hence I'm definitely not in the position to give financial advice. Also I'm long on slv, silver options and bought the silver of some local shops.\n\nTL;DR:This post is **NOT about GME**. No selly selly - I get the hype! But silver might be one of the best chances for the upcoming weeks I believe. And today it's still a chance to get in early at low prices.\n\ne/okay, guess we have to wait until GME is through. Looks like most in here aren't open for a new relationsship. Anything that's not GME/AMC gets downvoted to hell. ITT: People with weak hands scared of any funds going from gme to slv - this is ridiculous.  \n\ne2/ Thx for gold, even though silver would have done it!",

        "selftext": "**TLDR: \"CoNtrARiaN\" but actually just a\ndick-eating bear thesis that the SQUEEZE has in fact, been ALREADY SQUOZE.**\n\n_Let me preface that for all the 5M newbies to this sub, I\nam saddened that my favorite sub since 2017 has been invaded by normies. But at\nthe same time, I am excited for all the new amount of fodder (yeah, you) for\nmemes. So WELCOME TO THE GANG, GANG &amp;lt;3_\n\n**\n\nTHESIS: The big short squeeze has already happened.**\n\n**\n\nWhen?**\n\nApproximately from the when our lord and savior Burry probably cashed out\n(sometime before his settlement date for 13-F filing coming out in 2 weeks\ntime) to when the news broke and Cramer shat his pants on CNBC last Monday.\n\n**\n\nWhy do you think this?**\n\nFirst, MELVIN was NOT the ONLY ones SHORT, they were just\nthe slowest ones to cover (and hence probably will continue to be the poster-child for\nbukkake gang-rape by millennials and zoomers with stimmy checks).\n\nSecond, GME literally went from $5 per share to $37 per\nshare by January 15, 2021, the settlement date for the latest short float\nupdate (I\u2019ll come back to your fucking daily updates from S3 Partners and Ortex\nlater on, and why I don\u2019t trust them).\n\nTo put it into perspective for these unscrupulous, criminal,\nBIG money positions on the short-side that have been here a LOOOONG time,\nthat\u2019s already a 750% loss.\n\nIf someone had put in **JUST** $1M in August 2020 (by the\nway, the short float % was around 99% at this time, so I KNOW more got in short\nafter this) hoping for a Gamestop bankruptcy, by Jan 15, 2021 these fuckers\nwould have lost $8M in total (initiating position would have been about 200K\nshares short, by the time it gets to 1/15/2021, $37 x 200K shares =\u00a0 $7.4M.\n\nSo, by wagering $1M on the short side, you now have to buy\nback and return your shares. You now have a $6.4M loss.\n\n**WELL THAT FUCKING SUCKS? Right? Well then what does a 400-IQ,\nuncircumcized-dick hedgie with a wedgie want to do about this situation? They\nGOTTA make that loss back SOMEWAY SOMEHOW.**\n\nYou could suck trucker dick or deal drugs, but these\nwhite-collar yuppies have enough power to NOT have to stoop down to that level.\n\n**\n\nHere is how they CAN, and probably ARE, doing it right\nnow:**\n\nMelvin wasn\u2019t the only short position. Just the most\nretarded one that didn\u2019t cover in time, so they had to go through a whole\nfucking liquidity crisis, class action lawsuit, and dick-eating meme-fest while\nliterally asking for sugar-daddy money. What about the less retarded short\npositions? Well, they probably have some losses too, because I mean, they did\nget squeezed in the earlier portion of the play, but now they have sights on\nsomething else.\n\n**First, your hedgies (excluding Melvin &amp; Citron)\ncontinue to push the narrative: \u201cThrow Melvin &amp; Citron to the masses and\nkeep the retail investors coming in with their diamond hands and high school\ndiplomas.\u201d**\n\nSecond, **hedgies go LONG on GME shares now**. WTF HOW?\nWell remember that for short positions, there are LENDERS of these shares.\nThese lenders would happily let go of their positions at the \u201ctop\u201d of a\nsqueeze. (It\u2019s ez fucking profit, and they want none of this mess).\n\nThird, you now have a long position with underlying shares.\nWhat\u2019s the best play here? You fucking write call options because the vol\npremiums are literally mooning at the moment. And I\u2019ve been on WSB long enough\nto know that WSB\u2019s risk management is literally just selling one-paired organ\nto afford the option premium on FDs.\n\nLastly, you push the narrative of a \u201cGAMMA SQUEEZE\u201d which is\nJUST a little bit too hard for your average joe from Mississippi to understand\nwith his Algebra 2 from high school \u2013 Essentially telling him, \u201cHEY THERES\nSTILL MORE TO SQUEEEEEZE.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n**\n\nREAL Gs MOVE IN SILENCE:**\n\nLook at the volumes, the float rotation in the past week for\nGME is already enough to have fucked virgins 20 times and sacrificed them to\ncapitalist gods. \n\nWhich means for hedgies with wedgies, it\u2019s no longer a\ntail-risk, blind-side event, it\u2019s time to REAP the souls of every stimmy check\nfool, by \u201cMaRkET MAkInG\u201d.\n\nIf I am that Hedgie, I write call options, while maintaining\na fa\u00e7ade that I will \u201crationally\u201d hedge those positions by buying more of the\nunderlying shares. FUN FACT: I already have them.\n\nYou stimmy check tards will keep buying into GME, because\nyou heard about it in the news over the weekend and want to get in on this\naction to \u201cSTICK IT TO THE MAN\u201d because 2020 has been an absolute suicidal\ndescent into madness because of COVID. You will probably go on for a couple\nmore days this upcoming week, now that liquidity restrictions are slowly being\nlifted on trading platforms.\n\nSO, while you fools supply buying volume, all I have to do\nis collect my premiums on option sales, while slowly unwinding my underlying\nshare positions, and thereby also managing risk of option assignment since I\u2019ll\nsell shares into every spike and swerve the price away from the strike price of\nYOUR options.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll also have an expectation as to where GME could\npotentially rise to. You just look at the WSB subscriber count, multiply that\nby the avg retail trader account liquidity.\n\nYou guys will think you have stuck it to the man, but the\nman is sticking your wife ALREADY, ever since the moment you got angry and\nemotional about an opportunity to unleash your pent up hatred towards the Wall\nStreet system. All I am saying is, for every tard like Melvin, there\u2019s 20 other\nhedgies out there to fuck you up without you even realizing it. After all it\u2019s\ndone, they\u2019ll even make you feel bad, saying you were \u201cGreedy\u201d and \u201cReckless\u201d,\nfurther perpetuating emotional volatility in markets that they will keep\nprofiting off of.\n\nSo while the retail GME HODLER thinks there\u2019s still enough\ngold raining from the top of midtown Manhattan, all they\u2019re getting is piss and\npre-cum.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**\n\nAPPENDIX \u2013 Ortex &amp; S3 Partners**\n\nIf you got all the way through until now, I apologize for my\nlack of presentation in this thesis, it\u2019s literally 3AM in the East Coast US\nbecause I\u2019m up for 4AM pre-market (don\u2019t fucking judge me, I\u2019m a retard too).\n\nSo I\u2019ll explain that point from WAY up there about short\ninterest estimates.\n\nI don\u2019t give a flying fuck what Ortex and S3 Partners says.\nI do NOT believe that short float is STILL above %100 after the official data\ncame out on 1/27 with a lag of two fucking weeks from its settlement date on\n1/15. The stock price moved so egregiously that every autist in Manhattan would\nhave literally gone bankrupt if they\u2019re still short, NOT just Melvin.\n\nSee, here\u2019s the thing. If the system is ALREADY built with\nthis **two weeks lag** on short data for individual stocks, what fucking\ndata analytics company in their right mind would NOT try to take advantage of\nthis time &amp; information arbitrage? The system is FUCKED, but it gets\nperpetuated because the ones perpetuating this have the MOST to gain.\n\nOrtex and S3 Partners is purely a marketing ploy, they\nhopped on this gravy train to get your subcriptions and some more clicky-clicks\non their website traffic so they can use those metrics to raise some more funds\nlater on.\n\nAnd even if they believed in your cause, no smart data\nanalytics firm would willingly give up that information arbitrage to the\npublic, if they want to ever think about doing business with ANY hedge-fund in\ntown.\n\nTherefore, I am sticking to my autistic thought that the\nsystem is stacked (which most of you agree) against us. BUT, I urge you to be a\nlittle bit more careful, because short float data can be misleading at best and\na total fraudulent bull-trap at worst. \n\nAgain, If you are new here, welcome to the gang. This sub\nwill always be about losing money and becoming best friends with your wife\u2019s\nboyfriend. But over time, it will be about the friends and knowledge you gained\nalong the way.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**\n\nThank you for listening to my ted-talk. I expect a PHD\ntag for my 8-inch dick.**",

        "selftext": "Good morning autists! Due to the large influx of new users, I think it's a good idea to go over a *very* important aspect of trading -- taxes.\n\nNow, there have been multitudes of sick gains posted over the past weeks. You may be thinking of dropping yours on a new Lambo, and rightly so, but before you do, make sure you determine how deep the Tax Man is going to have his hand in your pockets come next year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Capital Gains\n\nA Capital gain is exactly what you should expect: a gain realized from trading something of value. When you bought 1 GME share for $20 and sold for $500, you realized a $480 capital gain.\n\nCapital gains are taxed through two different schedules in the U.S.: Long-term Capital Gains tax and Short-term Capital Gains tax. Again, as you might suspect, these taxes are applied based on how long you held the capital. **To qualify for the long-term capital gains tax, you must hold the capital for more than one year**. Everything else is taxed as short-term.\n\nNote that this only applies to those without \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50, as you are only taxed on gains made from closing a position (*realized* gains).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Long-term Capital Gains\n\nNow, if you saw the original comment by our lord and savior u/DeepFuckingValue and jumped in at the same time, you would qualify for the long-term capital gains tax:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|$ Amount|Tax Rate|\n|:-|:-|\n|$0 - $40,000|0%|\n| $40,000 - $441,450 |15%|\n| $441,450 - \u221e |20%|\n\nThe brackets above represent taxation on a Single taxpayer. [You can find the brackets for Married (filing jointly or separately) and Head of Household here.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/101515/comparing-longterm-vs-shortterm-capital-gain-tax-rates.asp)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Short-term Capital Gains\n\nI would imagine that most of you did *not* jump in with DFV over a year ago, and thus are subject to the short-term capital gains tax. Short term capital gains are taxed as regular income, meaning that it is summed with any additional income you make throughout the year at a regular job.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|$ Amount|Tax Rate|\n|:-|:-|\n| 0 - $9,875 |10%|\n| $9,876 - $40,125 |12%|\n| $40,126 - $85,525 |22%|\n| $85,526 - $163,300 |24%|\n| $163,301 - $207,350 |32%|\n| $207,351 - $518,400 |35%|\n| $518,400 - \u221e|37%|\n\nThe brackets above represent taxation on a Single taxpayer. [You can find the brackets for Married (filing jointly or separately) and Head of Household here.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/101515/comparing-longterm-vs-shortterm-capital-gain-tax-rates.asp)\n\nThere is a caveat to the tax brackets above -- Federal income tax is applied at a *progressive rate*. \n\nIf you make $100,000 at your job this year and a $70,000 short-term gain with GME, you might expect to pay a 32% tax and owe $54,400. However, you actually would only owe $35,415.50. \n\nThe progressive rate schedule means that the first $9,875 you earn is taxed at 10%, then the next $30,249 ($40,125 - the $9876 which was already taxed at 10%) is taxed at 12%, then the next $45,399 is taxed at 22%, and so on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can see, it is much more tax advantageous to hold. Even the federal government wants you to hold. **SO HOLD.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a tax professional. This only applies to U.S. residents. The information herein is only in respect to **Federal** tax. There may or may not be state-specific tax as well. There are *many* other factors that may increase or decrease your taxable income. Certain equities/equity derivatives are taxed differently than stated above. If you made bank over the past few weeks, **TALK TO A CPA**. My limited knowledge of tax law could be wrong -- if you see a mistake, leave a comment and I will correct it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**tl;dr:** [Ben Franklin once wrote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_and_taxes_(idiom)) that in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except **death and taxes.** Do not spend all of your gains without accounting for taxes. The tax man *will* have you pay in some form or fashion; whether it's in cash, repossession, wage garnishment, or jail is up to you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Sources:\n\n[Investopedia: Understanding Long-Term vs. Short-Term Capital Gains](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/101515/comparing-longterm-vs-shortterm-capital-gain-tax-rates.asp)\n\n[IRS: Capital Gains Tax Rates](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc409)\n\n[IRS: RP-19-44 (Income Tax)](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rp-19-44.pdf)",

        "selftext": "You know, traditionally r/wsb smooth brain has been a simple animal with a heart of gold. If things have gone wrong, you guys haven't learned anything at all from it. But if you have hit a jackpot, you have been generous with donations to charities.\n\nBut the one thing we haven't really shared as much has been the deep wisdom of the ordinary people from all walks of life. I mean, we would teach our own kids everything we know, so why not do the same for those struggling hedge fund managers, right? I mean, they are only trying to make living and are clearly in a need for some fatherly guidance (just not in the Vatican way of giving it), so I just though it would be time to make a concerted effort to give something back.\n\nI was very inspired by the comments section at r/news, where people are already giving some very helpful advice.\n\nu/Blank_bill suggested that they should invest their money. This is a solid advice. I've heard that McDonald's has been known to help learning this, so hedge fund managers really should give it a shot getting a job there. Like u/GhostofRimbaud said it, they should try looking in the paper and going into establishments with resume in hand, give the boss a firm handshake and ask for a job. I like this, it gives a good impression.\n\nu/bill_hilly also very helpfully noted, that stock market has an inherent risk, so they should not invest more than they are willing to lose. But they could use that stimulus check to do that, u/dietsaddad was kind enough to point that one is coming in no time at all, just 10 short months.\n\nMany people, including but not limited to u/BrownSugarBabe, rightfully pointed that skipping the avocado toast and Starbucks coffee and maybe driving an Uber would help to make up the difference. As u/artbored noted, they wouldn't be struggling nearly as much if they just skipped those $7 lattes.\n\nThat's an amazing insight and managers clearly should learn from this. They just have to, as u/csirke4 and many others pointed out, pull themselves by the bootstraps. Maybe learn to code Python or something.\n\nOr perhaps, like u/WeAllSuk pointed, maybe they have some old video games that they could sell.\n\nBut if they can't get a job (although u/coachmdubz said the nearest Amazon warehouse is hiring), they could just, as kindly noted by u/Brewboo, \"maybe take that unpaid internship and through hard work and determination one day they too can have a lucrative career.\"\n\nThis is amazing, with this advice those poor managers on a good career path in no time at all. Or like u/HeyItsTheShanster said, they could learn a trade and be their own bosses.\n\nPersonally, I believe families should help and support each other and it's very normal in most part of the world for the children to help out their struggling parents. I mean, camgirls are always wanted and there is always that occasional r/wallstreetbets millionaire in need of that special massage, that could really help to pay for a tuition if the hedge fund manager's paycheck from the Wendy's is not quite enough.\n\nNow, I know what you guys are thinking: \"hedge fund managers don't read reddit and those texts in billboards and behind flying airplanes are too damn short!\" This is why we could use some outside help to make all the users' helpful advice more visible to them. Just like John Oliver always helped Trump on Fox commercial breaks.\n\nBut I'm sure those poor, struggling hedge fund managers could use all the advice $GME holders can give them from their vast life experiences. Now, we wouldn't want them have to sell one of their yachts, would we?\n\nI am eagerly waiting to hear all the nuggets of wisdom you guys have to give for those poor folks at Melvin Capital and their friends.\n\nEdit: grammar\n\nEdit 2: since some people seem confused, let me clarify. Point is that one of the great pleasures of life is to piss people off by making them eat their own words. If you can make it publicly in an incredibly sarcastic and passive-aggressive tone, even better.\n\nIn this case, giving the reckless billionaire fucks running the hedge funds the same condescending advice \"lazy\" young people struggling with a low-wage dead-end jobs have been receiving for years.\n\nEdit 3: It's one thing to shit on hedge funds by refusing to sell, but we can do better, we can really rub it in while we still have the media attention. \n\nIf even one person with journalistic or otherwise relevant background or any connection to reporters, actors, screenwriters or other people sees this and sees some potential comedic value in it and any of the lines end up being used somewhere, we might have been able ruin some bigwig's day. And it won't cost us a penny.",

For example, Mizuho upgraded Selecta Biosciences as recently as [last week](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-selb-a-buy-or-sell-right-now-2021-01/), while HC Wainwright issued a buy rating on January 7th, and Canaccord Genuity set a $13.00 [price target](https://www.analystratings.com/articles/canaccord-genuity-sticks-to-its-buy-rating-for-selecta-biosciences-selb/) also on January 7th. \n\n &gt; The stock currently trades at a 21% discount from its 52 week high of $4.83.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**COMPANY OVERVIEW**\n\nSelecta Biosciences is a clinical-stage biotechnology company, headquartered in Watertown, Massachusetts, and led by President and CEO, Dr. Carsten Brunn, who previously served as the President of Pharmaceuticals at Bayer (American Region). Selecta Biosciences was founded in 2008, and initiated their public offering on June 22nd, 2016. Their flagship product is the clinically-validated ImmTOR platform, a system for developing antigen-specific tolerogenic therapies. They have acquireed partnerships with multiple major pharmaceutical\ncompanies, including [Sobi](https://www.sobi.com/), [Serepta Therapeutics](https://www.sarepta.com/), and [AskBio](https://www.askbio.com/), and they have recently received a consensus analyst buy rating, with an upper end price target of $13, representing a 225% increase from the current share price. The science behind Selecta, and their ImmTOR technology, is largely based on a 1994 [research paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8128245/) published in the journal *Science*. In 2006, [Dr. Omid Farokhzad](https://farokhzad.bwh.harvard.edu/wp/members/principal-investigator/), a professor at Harvard Medical school and the director of [The Center for Nanomedicine at BWH](https://nanomedicine.bwh.harvard.edu/), along with prolific MIT inventor, [Dr. Robert Langer](https://www.statnews.com/2016/05/31/robert-langer-biotech-new-york-city/), published a [highly cited paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17070960/) showing how to use synthesized nanoparticles to deliver drugs to cancer cells. In 2008, they founded Selecta Biosciences with Harvard immunologist Ulrich von Andrian.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHAT DOES THE COMPANY MANAGEMENT LOOK LIKE?**\n\nIf you have followed some of my previous posts and comments, you will know that I consider management to be the most important factor. Regardless of the product, industry, or finances, it is the people running the company that will determine its success. In my opinion, among every biotechnology company that I have evaluated, Selecta Biosciences has the strongest management team.\n\nSelecta Biosciences is led by President and CEO, Dr. Carsten Brunn, who holds a Ph.D\nin chemistry, from the University of Hamburg. Prior to his work at Selecta, Dr. Brunn was\nthe president of Pharmaceuticals for the Americas Region at Bayer. He served as chairman\nof the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations Japan, and he held senior leadership positions at Eli Lilly, Novartis, Basilea, and Bausch &amp; Lomb.\n\nSelecta\u2019s Chief Scientific Officer is Dr. Takashi Keisters Kishimoto, who holds a Ph.D in immunology\nfrom Harvard University. Dr. Kishimoto was previously the Vice President of Discovery\nResearch at Momenta Pharmaceuticals, a biotechnology company that was purchased\nBy Johnson &amp; Johnson in October of 2020, for $6.5 billion. Over the course of his career, \nDr. Kishimoto has published over 50 peer-reviewed articles in major scientific journals, \nIncluding Nature, Science, and The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nAmong their all-star Board of Directors is [Dr. Goran A. Ando](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/gran-ando), a 37 year veteran in the\npharmaceutical industry. Dr. Ando is the former Chairman of the Board of Novo Nordisk, one \nof the world\u2019s leading pharmaceutical companies. Prior to that, Dr. Ando held executive\npositions at Pfizer and Bristol-Myers. \n\nFor a full list of leadership, please use [this link](https://selectabio.com/about-us/).\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHAT IS THE ImmTOR PLATFORM?**\n\nLet\u2019s start with an introduction to the problem. Immunogenicity is the ability of a substance to stimulate an antigen-specific immune response. Antigens include a wide array of substances produced by cells,\nbacteria, fungi, or other organisms, but they are typically proteins. Unfortunately, immunogenicity can cause unwanted immune responses, such as the formation\nof anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), which can alter the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of different drugs, or the induction of hypersensitivity reactions, which have life-threatening\nconsequences. ImmTOR is coadministered with biologic therapies, and it is shown to restore natural tolerance and enable patients to remain on therapies longer.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**HOW DOES THE ImmTOR PLATFORM WORK?**\n\nFrom Selecta Biosciences,\n\n&gt; ImmTOR is designed to induce antigen-specific immune tolerance by targeting rapamycin to immune cells using nanoparticle technology, which has been clinically proven as an effective delivery system. When administered to a patient, ImmTOR nanoparticles are filtered out by lymph nodes, spleen and liver, where they are taken up by antigen-presenting cells (APC), such as dendritic cells (DC), a type of APC which can trigger immunogenic as well as tolerogenic responses from T cells. ImmTOR promotes the induction of tolerogenic DC which go on to activate antigen-specific regulatory T cells to suppress the immune response to the antigen.\n\nFor a more in-depth look at ImmTOR, please refer to [this article](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.00969/full#:~:text=general%20immune%20suppression%20is%20supported,to%20subsequent%20challenge%20with%20antigen), which discusses\nThe development of ImmTOR Tolerogenic Nanoparticles.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHAT DOES THEIR PIPELINE LOOK LIKE?**\n\nFor a portfolio overview, please use [this link](https://selectabio.com/portfolio/)\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHERE CAN I FIND PEER-REVIEWED RESEARCH?**\n\nYou can find a selection of peer-reviewed research [here](https://selectabio.com/resources/).\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHAT PARTNERSHIPS HAS SELECTA SECURED?**\n\nSelecta has several research and commercial rights partnerships with global pharmaceutical companies. These \ninclude [Sobi](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/06/11/2047185/0/en/Sobi-and-Selecta-announce-strategic-licensing-agreement-for-SEL-212-a-phase-3-ready-novel-treatment-for-Chronic-Refractory-Gout.html), for strategic licensing of SEL-212, [AskBio](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/12/19/1962801/0/en/AskBio-Licenses-Rights-to-Selecta-Biosciences-ImmTOR-Immune-Tolerance-Platform-for-the-Treatment-of-Pompe-Disease.html) for the use of ImmTOR in the treatment\nof Pompe Disease, and [Serepta Therapeutics](https://investorrelations.sarepta.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sarepta-therapeutics-and-selecta-biosciences-enter-research)\nfor the use of ImmTOR for the treatment of neuromuscular diseases.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHAT IS THE VALUE PROPOSITION?**\n\nThis is likely one of the easiest questions to answer. A large amount of drugs provoke unwanted immune responses, which reduce a drug\u2019s efficacy\nand exacerbate adverse effects. The ImmTOR platform creates drug-specific immune tolerance, enhancing the effectiveness of drugs, as well\nas its safety profile. This means the ImmTOR platform can be used in cooperation with a substantial amount of other drugs. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHAT IS SELECTA BIOSCIENCES FINANCIAL SITUATION?**\n\n\n*Recent Financing:* \n\nOn June 11th of 2020, Selecta entered into a [strategic licensing agreement](https://www.sobi.com/en/press-releases/sobi-and-selecta-announce-strategic-licensing-agreement-sel-212-phase-3-ready-novel)\nwith [Sobi](https://www.sobi.com/en/about), and international biopharmaceutical company worth $48 billion. \nThe agreement is for SEL-212, Selecta\u2019s phase-3-ready therapy powered\nby ImmTOR, their immune tolerance platform. Included in the deal is an initial\npayment of $100 million, commercial and milestone payments of up to\n$630 million, tiered double-digit royalties on net sales, and equity purchases at $4.62/share.\nThis means you can currently purchase shares at a discount to what Sobi paid. \n\n\nOn September 1st of 2020, Selecta Biosciences secured up to [$35 million in debt financing](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/09/01/2086854/0/en/Selecta-Biosciences-Secures-Up-To-35-Million-Debt-Financing-with-Oxford-Finance-LLC-and-Silicon-Valley-Bank.html#:~:text=Under%20the%20terms%20of%20the,achievement%20of%20two%20development%20milestones%3A), available in two tranches, \nwith $25 million issued at closing, and an additional $10 million available through September 30th of 2021. Part of these proceeds will be used to retire $12.6 million\nin existing debt.\n\n*Cash Position:* \n\nSelecta had $147.6 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash as of September 30, 2020, which compares to cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $91.6 million as of December 31, 2019. Selecta believes its available cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash as of September 30, 2020 will enable Selecta to fund operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the first quarter of 2023.\n\n*Revenue:* \n\nRevenue recognition for the third quarter 2020 was $4.6 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2020, we recognized $4.3 million under the license agreement with Sobi resulting from the shipment of clinical supply and the reimbursement of costs incurred for the Phase 3 DISSOLVE clinical program and $0.3 million for shipments under the collaboration agreement with Sarepta. During the three months ended September 30, 2019, Selecta did not recognize revenue.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHAT KEY MILESTONES HAVE RECENTLY BEEN ACHIEVED?**\n\n* **1.** In September, Selecta commenced the Phase 3 clinical program, known as [DISSOLVE](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/09/23/2097859/0/en/First-Patient-Randomized-in-the-Phase-3-DISSOLVE-Clinical-Program-of-SEL-212-for-Chronic-Refractory-Gout.html) for the clinical evaluation of SEL-212, which is the foundation\nfor Selecta\u2019s pipeline of tolerogenic therapies. \n\n* **2.** In October, the FDA granted Selecta the [Rare Pediatric Disease Designation](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/20/2111023/0/en/Selecta-Biosciences-and-AskBio-Receive-FDA-Rare-Pediatric-Disease-Designation-for-their-Gene-Therapy-for-Methylmalonic-Acidemia.html) for MMA-101, used in the treatment of\nIsolated methylmalonic academia. This designation highlights the significant unmet medial need that Selecta is seeking to address. Phase 1 clinical trials\nare expected to begin in the first half of 2021, with data expected before the end of the year. \n\n* **3.** Also in October, Selecta and IGAN Biosciences entered into a [research license and option agreement](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/08/2105919/0/en/Selecta-Biosciences-and-IGAN-Biosciences-Enter-into-Research-License-and-Option-Agreement-to-Study-Selecta-s-ImmTOR-Immune-Tolerance-Platform-in-Combination-with-IGAN-s-IgA-Proteas.html)\nwhich provides Selecta with the option to exclusive licensure for the rights to develop and commercialize the ImmTOR platform in\ncombination with IGAN\u2019s [IgA protease](https://www.iganbio.com/iga-protease-for-igan/), which is used to treat [IgA Nephropathy](https://igan.org/)\n\n* **4.** On January 6th, Selecta announced pre-clinical data in non-human primates\nthat validated the ImmTOR platform\u2019s ability to enhance the efficacy, safety and durability of \nadeno-associated viral vector gene therapies. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHAT DOES THE INSIDER ACTIVITY LOOK LIKE**\n\nInsider activity is an excellent way to assess the confidence of the company executives. I\u2019m sure most of you are familiar with the phrase, \u201cput your money\nwhere your mouth is\u201d. I prefer to speculate on companies where the executives have a large incentive for success.\n\nOver the last twelve months, we\u2019ve seen a staggering 9,351,485 [shares purchased by insiders](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/selb/insider-activity), compared against 13,314 that were sold.\nOn January 4th of 2021, we saw 262,000 non-open market shares acquired by company officers, and in October, Timothy Springer [purchased a whopping](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/timothy-springer-just-bought-25-142015780.html)\n$5.4 million worth of stock.\n\nIn addition to this, Selecta has an astounding institutional ownership of 64.41%, compiled from 98 different institutional holders.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHAT DOES THE OPTION CHAIN LOOK LIKE?**\n\nSelecta has options available with three strike prices and expirations on March 19th, June 18th, and September 17th. The March 19th $5 call options have recently seen a volume spike, and had\nan open interest of 2564 as of Friday, January 29th. These are the highest volume of all available options. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHY AM I PURCHASING THE STOCK NOW?**\n\nIn my opinion, all clinical-stage biotechnology companies present three obvious challenges. Will their product work, do they have enough capital to reach commercialization, and have they partnered with any major company that can accelerate their product or service? Prior to discovering these answers, biotechs are highly speculative. After years of development, I believe that Selecta has reached all three milestones. In light of these milestones, as well as analyst endorsements, FDA approvals, institutional and insider purchasing, option volume and volatility, and growing sentiment, I think Selecta is poised for significant growth. Beyond this, I find tremendous value in a company that has licensing deals worth more than the companies entire market capitilization. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**TL:DR;**\n\nSelecta Biosciences is a Watertown, Massachusetts based biotechnology company. They are engaged in the \nresearch and development of nanoparticle immunomodulatory drugs that work in conjunction with existing\nbiologics, for the treatment and prevention of numerous human diseases. Their flagship product\nis the ImmTOR Tolerogenic Nanoparticle Platform, a technology used to mitigate anti-drug antibodies (ADAs)\nin response to life-sustaining drugs. Their lead pharmaceutical candidate is SEL-212, a Phase 3 enzymatic \ntherapy for the treatment of gout, one of the most common forms of arthritis. The company is managed by\na cast of successful executives, many of whom previously held leadership roles at Pfizer, Novo Nordisk, Bayer,\nand other global pharmaceutical companies. They are financed through 2023, and have recently received\na consensus buy rating from major analysts, with a price target range of $7-$13. The stock is majority held by \ninstitutional investors, and insiders have made large volume share acquisitions over the past several months. \nTheir partnership with Sobi, an international pharmaceutical juggernaut, is worth $100 million in\ninitial payments, and over $630 million in commercial and milestone payments. This deal alone\nis worth more than Selecta\u2019s entire market capitalization. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**POSITIONS**\n\n4,000 shares at $4.28, but I plan to increase my position this week.",

        "selftext": "Well, here they come hold on to your seats girls. Even CCIV has a mention. Chamath too. \n\nARTICLE (abbreviated):\n\n[WSJ:  GameStop Day Traders Are Moving Into SPACs](https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestop-day-traders-are-moving-into-spacs-11612175401)\n\nDay traders fueling enormous gains in popular stocks such as GameStop Corp. GME 67.87% are also powering big swings for another suddenly hot investment: so-called blank-check companies. \n\nSpecial-purpose acquisition companies\u2014shell companies planning to merge with private firms to take them public\u2014are rising more than 6% on average on their first day of trading in 2021, up from last year\u2019s figure of 1.6%, according to University of Florida finance professor Jay Ritter. Before 2020, trading in SPACs was muted when they made their debut on public markets. \n\nNow, shares of blank-check companies almost always go up. The last 140 SPACs to go public have either logged gains or ended flat on their opening day of trading, per a Dow Jones Market Data analysis of trading in blank-check companies through Thursday. One hundred and seventeen in a row have risen in their first week. The gains tend to continue, on average generating bigger returns going out to a few months. \n\nThe gains in companies that don\u2019t yet have any underlying business underscore the wave of speculation in today\u2019s markets. Merging with a SPAC has become a popular way for startups in buzzy sectors to go public and take advantage of investor enthusiasm for futuristic themes.\n\nBut lately, day traders are even putting money into SPACs before they have revealed what company they are buying. At that stage, they are pools of cash, so investors are wagering that the company will eventually complete an attractive deal. \n\nDespite the risks, many are embracing the trade, underscoring how online investing platforms and social-media groups now send individuals flocking to new corners of markets, including shares of unprofitable companies such as GameStop and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. AMC 53.65% That trend also is playing out in everything from shares of silver miners to SPACs, which were relatively rare before last year but are suddenly ubiquitous in finance. \u201cI would just have a bad case of FOMO if I wasn\u2019t in SPACs,\u201d said Marco Prieto, a 23-year-old real-estate agent living in Tucson, Ariz., referring to the fear of missing out that is driving many individuals to put money into markets.\n\nHe has a roughly $50,000 portfolio and about 60% of his holdings tied to blank-check companies. Some of his positions are early on in shell firms such as Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp. VI, while others are based on rumors tied to possible deals by companies including Churchill Capital Corp. IV.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/05bjlwom0ve61.png?width=894&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7df4064e2799ed07d29f21944c621d77fb6f8c1a\n\nShares of that company have more than doubled since Bloomberg News reported on Jan. 11 that it is in talks to combine with electric-car firm Lucid Motors Inc. Trading got so frenzied that the SPAC put out a statement a week later saying it wouldn\u2019t comment on the report and that it is always evaluating a number of possible deals. The stock has still been gyrating in the days since. Investors betting on SPACs even before such reports is extraordinary because the underlying value of a blank-check firm before it pursues a deal is the amount of money it raises for a public listing. That figure is typically pegged at $10 a share. \n\nStill, it has become common for investors to buy at higher prices such as $11 or $12 to back big-name SPAC founders such as venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya and former Citigroup Inc. deal maker Michael Klein. In another sign blank-check firms are now frequently traded by individuals, several SPACs and companies that have merged with them recently joined GameStop and AMC on a list of stocks that have position limits on Robinhood Markets Inc., a popular brokerage for day traders. Those restricted include Mr. Klein\u2019s Churchill Capital IV and a few of Mr. Palihapitiya\u2019s SPACs in the Social Capital Hedosophia SPCE 2.74% franchise.\n\nMods: thanks for allowing this to be posted, it clearly is not pumping any of the companies that have recently gone up by 3000%",

        "selftext": "Hello stocks,\n\nI'm a relatively newer investor and have been picking up new information and gaining skills as I go along. With all this craziness happening in the stock market I had a really sobering experience that I've been having trouble with. This is maybe more of a mental and emotional self-care question than it is a stock question, but I figure some people here have had a similar experience and can help me out or share some advice or stories or something.\n\nI started accumulating some GME at the end of November based on all the DD that was floating around. I bought slowly and ended up with 255 shares at 55 cost bases and 7(!) april 29 $25 calls. I really didn't expect something like this to actually happen. I had a loss on this all through December so when the price shot up the first time in January I sold 4 calls for a $3000 profit. Thats the first big ouch. Those would be worth more than 100,000 right now.\n\nThe remaining securities I kept until the commotion last week. I had never expected to have so much money in my whole life. My account blew up to 250,000 at the peak on Friday (I started with 20,000). I had already taken some profits at 320, 100 shares. Then when the huge spike to 490 and dip to 115 happened on Friday I freaked out and sol 100 shares and 2 calls when GME was around $140.  was trading emotionally and scared and not logically. I had even laid out an exit strategy and I ignored it. This was obviously an incredibly stupid play and I feel heavy regret about it. I know I shouldn't. I made 1000x my initial investment already. Yet I still feel depressed. I don't feel like I gained 100,000. I feel like I lost 400,000.\n\nI know it's stupid and I'm incredibly lucky to have found myself in this incredible trade as such a new investor. But I still feel heavy regret and it's really getting me down at a moment in my life when I should be celebrating. How do you all deal with regret?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR\n\nI panic sold GME and made a 1000x profit but I traded emotionally and left so much money on the table. How do I get over the regret and be happy about my profit and remaining position?\n\nStill in for a call and 55 shares!",

        "selftext": "Too Long Can't Read: HOLD GME!!! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf19\n\nFirst, I'm not an advisor or some quant with some bullshit MBA from a Top Tier school trying to scare anybody. \n\nWith everybody dropping RH like my ex-wife dropping me for Chad, I wanted to read on the process during the transfer of these accounts. \n\nI noticed a post where Fidelity was up 700% in transfer requests this weekend. I would assume the same for other non BROKErages. \n\nI have Fidelity and I use ToS for charting, but I read up on the process for transfer from RH. First you have to pay $75 bucks to get transferred from RH. That's a crock of shit but I guess its still \"free\" trading. \n\nSecondly, RH will sell your fractional shares prior to transfer through ACATS (This is the system for \"transferring\" shares from one brokerage to another). This will take place prior to T+2 which is the SEC standard. Now when your transfer is taking place you do not have access to trading your stonks at all. Time to bring back the old PornHub..\n\nThirdly, all your limit orders have been canceled during this process. This means that if GME tanks (HOLD you dumbfuck) you will be out of it and just screaming at the screen seeing dildos (green or red) while your wife is boned by her bf.\n\nLastly, the process fully takes 10-14 days to \"settle\". You get credit for the stonks at T+2 but there could be restrictions on trading depending on the brokerage. Fidelity does not have this issue...\n\nBut broneilbro...what does this mean for GME? Well, kid...\n\n1. RH will clump all the fractional shares from the transferees together and dump them at market per RH \n&gt; \"If you have any fractional shares during a full account transfer, they will be sold, and the resulting funds will be transferred to the other brokerage as cash during a residual sweep.\" https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/transfer-stocks-out-of-your-robinhood-account/** \n\n  These will be gobbled up by hopefully the GMEGang but it will supply shares to the market. Depending on how many full shares this could minimal if assuming a .99 fractional share x RH transferees...\n\n2. The GME shares that are transffered will effectively be \"off the table\" during the ACAT process which will lead to a massive \"group\" HOLD for T+2 days depending on when RH autists transferred out. This should cause a drop in volume since GME retards won't be able to trade but will help out as the shorts cannot buy these shares as they are out of play.\n\n3. The process for getting margin approval and options access could take a few days due to the volume of transferees. This will show up as a general \"pause\" within GME as traders are waiting for account access. This could be good or bad depending on the view. \n\n4. This mass transfer out of RH will be a blessing to them as they will not have to deal with the GME liquidity funding mechanisms. \n\nJust my thoughts on everybody fleeing RH...there will be a slight pause but that will give people a chance to poke around the platforms and get used to it prior to going all in on GME...\n\nTLDR: HOLD GME!!! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf19 &lt;Almost forget these...&gt;\n\nLong: GME = 500 at 38 at Fidelity...",

        "selftext": "\ud83d\ude80MAC\ud83d\ude80 is the best short squeeze play at the moment. If you missed the GME train then MAC is definitely what you have been waiting for. Mac has only increased by 80% since December, from 10$ to 16.8$, meaning this is a squeeze where you still have the opportunity to come aboard early.\n\nMAC is a solid company with short % of Float 85.84%, Short % of Shares Outstanding 52.55%, Shares Short 78M as of 30/1. This is even a good longterm play as they are currently severely undervalued &amp; has a good balance sheet.\n\nI think MAC can short squeeze much faster as well due to all the hype surrounding short squeezes in the market &amp; MAC being insanely undervalued. Which is making shorts very scared meaning they are more likely to cover way faster.\n\nMac recovered in 2009 after being fucked over by shorts and the same is guaranteed to happen now, the biggest difference is that this squeeze will be way bigger:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qxgv3570rue61.png?width=377&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a0bb0eb6053d67e8bdc79ee99bff77bd869e1c9\n\nMy pos:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/11vqyhg2rue61.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23deaff86a9461712581eb402e1def7ed4fa64d0\n\nThis is for sure the next short squeeze that will gain hype, you just need to join the MAC gang ride to tendie-town\u2122 and make more posts on different subreddits so MAC can gain hype even faster and to not to be paper-hand bitches. You need to hold the fucking line, buy the dips don't let the shorts scare you with their pathetic dips.\n\nWE ARE IN WAR WITH THE WALL STREET CORRUPTION, MELVIN CAPITAL AND CITADEL SHORT HEDGE FUND MANIPULATION.\n\nSTAY STRONG.\n\nTLDR:\n\n\\- Been shorted the fuck out of (Top 4)\n\n\\- Undervalued as fuck atm\n\n\\- The train has barely left the station compared to the other possible squeezes\n\n\\- A very low-risk play that has huge upside potential\n\n\\- Solid fundamentals, this is a good long term and short term play.\n\nSee you guys in tendie town \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is just a repost from Jussi Askola\u00b4s DD:\n\n* GameStop is going through a monumental short squeeze.\n* We think that its landlord, Macerich, is poised for a similar short squeeze.\n* MAC offers significant upside potential but with much better downside protection. For this reason, we believe that it is your next best short squeeze investment opportunity.\n\n**GameStop** (NYSE:GME) is up by nearly 200% in a single day\n\nContrarian investors who bought early into this short squeeze made fortunes in the process, and as a result, many of these same investors are today asking themselves:\n\n&gt;What the next best candidate for another short-squeeze?\n\nIf you look at a list of the most heavily shorted-stocks, you will find companies like Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY), AMC , Dillard's (DDS), and BlackBerry (BB), all of which are up significantly over the past weeks:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/55brjuc4rue61.png?width=635&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5002e77edf8d237d2d21e9a2f3147296f3c94704\n\nWe think that all of these companies offer significant upside potential as short sellers attempt to cover positions in fear of seeing another GME-like short squeeze.\n\nBut there is an even better short squeeze candidate, and it is called **Macerich** (MAC).\n\nMacerich is the landlord of all these companies. It owns some of the highest quality malls in the US and it is the fourth most heavily shorted company at the moment:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7dby1816rue61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c85ee9015d6708382622db784ba861902263d182\n\nf you are looking for a company with the potential to offer a GME-like short squeeze, but with better downside protection, MAC is your best pick.\n\nHere are 3 reasons why:\n\nReason #1: Significant Similarities to GameStop Will Attract Short Squeeze Hungry Investors\n\nUnlike other short squeeze candidates, MAC is actually in a direct business relationship with GME.\n\nGME is a mall-based video game retailer. MAC is the owner of the highest quality malls in the US, some of which are occupied by GME.\n\nAs such, MAC is the landlord and GME is the tenant. Both companies work hand in hand and MAC earns steady rental revenue from GME and other similar retailers.\n\nTherefore, anything that benefits GME also benefits MAC.\n\n&gt;**What are some other similarities between the two companies?**\n\n* They are some of the most heavily shorted companies in the world.\n* They have a small enough size to grow significantly.\n* They enjoy rapidly improving fundamentals.\n* They have an active options market.\n* And finally, they have a short thesis that's falling apart (more than in section #2 and #3)\n\nMAC is up by 30% over the past few days, but it remains down by 80% since 2015. Just to get to where it was, it would need to quadruple from here.\n\nIn comparison, GME is already trading at more than the triple of its previous all-time highs in 2007.\n\nIf MAC is going to follow GME's path, the short squeeze is just getting started.\n\nThat thought alone should be very scary to MAC short sellers. MAC is very similar to GME, and knowing what happened to GME, the risk-to-reward of shorting MAC has deteriorated very significantly over the past few days.\n\nHolding your short could literally ruin you.\n\nAs the shorts realize this, increasingly many may cover their position, causing the share price to rise, forcing others to cover too, causing the share price to rise even further, etc... It is the same virtuous cycle we have seen happen with GME.\n\nHowever, MAC enjoys better downside protection than GME, and this brings us to our next point:\n\nReason #2: Prime Real Estate Ownership And Sizable Cash Flow Provide Downside Protection\n\nGameStop, BlackBerry, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, AMC, and most other short squeeze candidates suffer one major issue:\n\nThey are extremely speculative companies.\n\nThey operate declining or even unprofitable businesses and offer little downside protection if and when the bubble bursts.\n\nA company like GameStop could drop back to where it was just as fast as it rose up. The company is losing money and it does not hold much tangible value.\n\nIn comparison, MAC is a much safer company with a resilient business, cash flow, and staying power.\n\nMAC owns the very best malls in the nation. These properties are not dying. Opposite of that, they have enjoyed steady sales and rent growth over the past decade:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uch3eh78rue61.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82e04be0f4a6b57520db1ce60b96c11fa2a47a7e\n\nEven through the Covid crisis, MAC has remained profitable and kept paying a dividend to shareholders. In the third-quarter conference call, the management noted that many of its malls have already recovered to \\~90% of pre-crisis sales per square foot.\n\nThis may surprise you, but there are good reasons why MAC's malls have so much staying power even in a highly digitized world.\n\nFirst of all, not all retail is created equal. The mall market is oversupplied in the US and as result, many of the lower-quality malls are dying. However, since MAC owns the highest quality malls, it actually benefits from this. As lower quality malls die, the supply of malls goes down, there is less competition, and the traffic consolidates towards the best malls, which are often owned by MAC.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u9gru9r9rue61.png?width=623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfc890012abc4311fc4bc9cf321b6f2519fbc745\n\nThe consolidation toward the best malls will only continue in the coming years and it will benefit MAC's properties.\n\nMoreover, MAC is busy redeveloping its malls to make them **Amazon**\\-proof (AMZN). Back in the day, malls were only for retail. You would go there for shopping, maybe there was a food court to grab a snack, and that's it.\n\nBut already today, MAC's malls are very different from what they used to be. They have become mixed-use destinations with large entertainment, service, hospitality, office, and even residential components.\n\nToday, retail is only one piece of the puzzle and all the other uses bring steady traffic and sales to the malls. Below you see a picture of Santa Monica Place, a MAC mall, with **Nike** (NKE) on the ground floor, and **Cheesecake Factory** (CAKE) right above it.\n\nIn short, we don't think that such properties are going anywhere.\n\nMAC owns highly valuable assets that generate significant cash flow that is likely to grow in the long run as a result of traffic consolidation towards the best malls and the continued redevelopment and densification of its assets.\n\n**Simon Property Group** (SPG) is one of the biggest and most successful real estate investors in the world and it offered to buy MAC at $95.50 per share back in 2015.\n\nSince then, the cash flow of its properties has only grown further, and yet, it trades at just below $20 as of right now.\n\nThe point that I am trying to make here is that investing in MAC today is much safer than investing in other popular short squeeze candidates. Regardless of what happens in the short run, we think that an investment in MAC will do well in the long run. We cannot say the same thing about GameStop, BlackBerry, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, or even AMC.\n\nReason #3: The Short Thesis is Falling Apart and a Number of Catalysts Could Force the Short Squeeze\n\nAs of right now, MAC is one of the most heavily shorted stocks in the world.\n\nIt is so heavily shorted because it is a highly leveraged mall REIT in the midst of a pandemic. Put simply, the short thesis is that malls are dying and MAC's covenant breach could force it to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.\n\nThese are legitimate risks to consider, but our recent shows that MAC's covenant situation is unlikely to pose an issue, and our long-term outlook for MAC's high-quality malls is very positive.\n\nMeanwhile, vaccinations are now well underway and the world is quickly returning back to normal, causing the short thesis to fall apart.\n\nEven then, MAC is still trading at a significant discount to fair value.\n\nThis is made evident by the fact that MAC's two closest peers (Taubman Centers (TCO &amp; Brookfield Property Partners (BPY)) are being bought out by other players. MAC is now the last remaining pure-play Class A mall REIT, and it is a prime target for a buyout and/or short squeeze. In fact, a large private equity firm bought a 6.8% stake in 2020, and more recently, it filled a 13-D with an amendment that allows them to acquire up to 14.9% of the equity.\n\n&gt;**Are they currently buying shares? Is this why MAC is rising? Are they preparing a buy-out?**\n\nWe don't know.\n\nBut what we do know is that MAC is extremely heavily shorted, deeply discounted, profitable, and things will only get better from here as the world returns to normal.\n\nWith all of that in mind, the risk-to-reward of shorting MAC is deteriorating even from a fundamental perspective.\n\nBottom Line\n\nIt offers similar potential as all the other popular short squeeze candidates (GameStop, BlackBerry, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, AMC), but the difference is that MAC actually has a real business with significant underlying value and recurrent cash flow.\n\nDisclaimer this is not investment advice do your own research",

        "selftext": "  Just wanted to say you are my favorite broker and it's been tough sending you business once you turned off fractionals for GameStop and possibly other shares. I think it's pretty weak if that was your decision to do so.\n\nThere's a lot of people flooding to your business and your mobile app now because of this subreddit. Even though the UI for your mobile app is pretty bad compared to ROBEMGOOD.\n\nAs a suggestion could you possibly open fractional investing up for people with the minimum deposit required to open an account with you? $100. Or maybe allocate a little of your large amount of shares for these retail investors?\n\nThere's a lot of people who would like to buy fractional shares in these companies you turned off and they have the right to do so. You were offering this option before. When everything went down and people couldn't buy shares you turned that option off.\n\nIf there's a reason these retail investors can't buy fractional shares, can you at least release an announcement as to why that is? And don't bullshit us?\n\nIf you have already turned the option back on, please disregard. With your Quick Ticket system that you have to use in order to buy fractional shares, you can't place an order until market opens.  So I haven't been able to check since Friday and it was still off. \n\nHere's an article from Reuters you posted that says ROBEMGOOD still isn't offering fractional shares.\n\nNeither was Fidelity last I checked even though I tested it prior to the whole fiasco and it worked. \n\n[https://www.fidelity.com/news/article/top-news/202101281910RTRSNEWSCOMBINED\\_KBN29X12T-OUSBS\\_1](https://www.fidelity.com/news/article/top-news/202101281910RTRSNEWSCOMBINED_KBN29X12T-OUSBS_1)\n\nDisclaimer: Not an advisor just think it's kind of shitty to turn off an option for investors with smaller amounts of capitol, unless you were forced by regulators to do so.  Then it's the regulators who are shitty. Unless there is no more actual shares to buy and that doesn't seem to be the case. What's going on with that?",

The idea of the remission year is that every creditor shall remit any debt owed by his neighbor and brother when God's remission year comes around. You may collect from the alien, but if you have any claim against your brother for a debt, you must relinquish it....\" (Deuteronomy 15:1\u20136)*\n\n*The correlation between Jewish Sabbatical years and major declines/crashes in stock prices is heavily studied. In the Judaism tradition, the number 7 holds great significance.

        "selftext": "This might be one of my last posts on KAVL because I don't believe it will remain a pennystock for much longer. Let me preface this post with my previous alerts, and before you ask \"but what about the loser picks\" - go look at my post history. I've not failed anyone, yet.\n\n8 Months Ago - KAVL alerted @ $0.145pps (now $1.19/share) - 8X \nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gvmdlv/sit_back_relax_and_let_me_tell_you_why_i_like_kavl/\n\n7 Months Ago - OPTI alerted @ .0042pps (now $0.23/share) - 54X\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/h0ylpj/today_should_be_an_exciting_day_for_opti/\n\n4 Months Ago - CBDD alerted @ .0013pps (now $0.025/share) - 19X https://old.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/iotee8/why_cbdd_should_be_on_your_radar_otc_pink/\n\n1 Month Ago - JNSH alerted @ .0065pps (now $0.026/share) - 4X\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/kaez1i/and_for_my_next_otc_trick_let_me_introduce_you_to/\n\nKAVL is a long-term hold for me. I'm not a day trader. If I really want in on something, I will bid just under the ask, and I will start small. Depends on the price per share but I try to stay under $500 worth. Look like a little guy, don't show all your cards at once. And don't chase. God, please no, do not chase a runner. I don't care if you never get in. This is not a race. There are thousands of other tickers. THOUSANDS.\n\nFirst and foremost, market cap. KAVL's total market cap is $330mm today. But they are anticipating $400 to 450mm in revenues for 2021. https://www.streetinsider.com/Investor+Brand+Network/InvestorNewsBreaks+%E2%80%93+Kaival+Brands+Innovations+Group+Inc.+%28KAVL%29+Eyes+Continued+Robust+Growth%2C+Expects+Over+%24400M+in+Fiscal+2021+Revenues/17790571.html\n\nSecondly, because of the above, I don't see any problem reaching $3 to 4/share in the very near future. Their 10K was delayed (due Jan 31st), however, they will also be required to post their 1st Quarter 10Q by March 15th. These are back-to-back positive catalysts coming that will show at a minimum $120mm for their first year in revenue and $100mm for the 1st Quarter of 2021.\n\nKAVL is in the vape distribution space, along with tobacco pouches. They've a network of 30,000 convenience stores including 7-Eleven and Circle K in the US, and they've initiated the process to distribute in the UK, Australia and New Zealand. Their key product is the Bidi Stick, and as of today, the Bidi Pouch hits retail shelves - generating an additional source of revenue. They've acquired patent rights to synthetic nicotine and intend to also, as a way to appease the FDA, enter the smoking cessation market.\n\nThe biggest reason I began establishing a position (and continuing to load as my last block was bought at $1.15/share) is the IPO of Chinese company $RLX.

This is for people who have a long view. We remember that when GME was 4 dollars to 9 dollars, we got the same hate and trolls. Keep focus on GME but let people diversify and eat crayons as they see fit. NOK is NOT a short squeeze and a totally different play from GME.\n\nNOK could be an undervalued stock with much room for growth, but I am just a retard so no financial advice here indeed.

Another fact: on 27th january Volume was up 3400% and billions of shares were traded, the price jumped to 9 and back to 6 and would have been there if NOK wasn't put under restrictions. If this was possible in 1 single day of trading, what could happen in normal conditions in a medium-long term?\n\nAlso, Ericcson has 3B float shares and the price is at 12.50. Nokia is at 4.5 now.\n\nBB was at 9 and went to 24 in a week before restrictions. There is PLENTY of potential room for growth for NOK, which is a solid player, and million of traders traded billion of share in one single day already.\n\nTL;DR Nokia is a great opportunity for having a stock that is cheap and has potential to grow. It is NOT a short squeeze but a normal company growing with moon potential (fucking LITERALLY). \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nEDIT - corrected typos and adding this post which had even more news&amp;rumors I was not aware of:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Nok/comments/la3ak2/i\\_just\\_called\\_nokia\\_customer\\_servicethey\\_asked\\_me/?utm\\_medium=android\\_app&amp;utm\\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nok/comments/la3ak2/i_just_called_nokia_customer_servicethey_asked_me/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)  \n\n\nEDIT2 - recent great DD on wsb with news about bullish sentiment, positions of top investors and other, EPS updates and other:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lafy84/nokia\\_nok\\_is\\_bad\\_idea\\_not\\_really\\_its\\_brilliant/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lafy84/nokia_nok_is_bad_idea_not_really_its_brilliant/)",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone!\n\nI spent the weekend looking for good opportunities to flip wall street. I set out looking for stocks that have good technicals to pull off a GME style short squeeze. I think DMC Global Inc, trading as BOOM (yep, that really is the ticker), is our best play. Here is why.\n\nTo find a play, I am looking for companies that are way over shorted, that aren\u2019t too big and that could be squeezed by a WSB onslaught. I looked for these things:\n\n1. Stock where there is **more than 100% institutional hold**, which indicates naked short selling\n2. Stock where there is **more than 15% of float that is openly shorted**, these are shares that have been borrowed and shorted.\n3. Stock with a **reasonable market cap** so we can move it, smaller is better here.\n4. Any other factors revealed by a review of the company.\n\nI am not an investment advisor and I am not giving any investment advice. #DYOR I have an MBA and know how markets work. I\u2019m a geek who got into coding and finance in high school and working and investing for more than 20 years. I bought my first Jag with investment gains and people asked if I was old enough to drive it! I also got screwed over multiple times by banks and institutional investors. In 2008, I lost 3 years of my hard work investing when a broker closed out some of my positions at the worst possible crashing moment (to protect me!) and left me holding a bag of shit. I watched my broker front run my trades. When started with OTC, I saw them settle their prop desk\u2019s least favorable trades of the day to me. Robinhood didn\u2019t invent this stuff. If you\u2019re in this to change Wall Street, let\u2019s break their trades and take back the markets.\n\nFirst, I think targeting companies like Nokia is a bad idea. **NOK has a market cap of 25.6 billion and not enough shorts on it. It will be very hard to move such a monster. BB is another case with few shorts and almost 9bil mkt cap.** AMC with a cap of 4.5 billion is already a challenge. GME was around 2 billion when we started this and it\u2019s 22 billion now - very hard to hold at this level. We have to ask: **\u201cHow big is this challenge - a mountain or a boulder?\u201d and \u201cWho\u2019s on the other side of  the trade and how deep?\u201d** Keep these questions in mind before we move.\n\nSecondly, **this is not long term investing** \\- we are playing a hard game vs. wall street. It\u2019s about momentum and trade positions. Company data doesn\u2019t matter: EPS, EBITDA, cash flow - it doesn\u2019t matter for a short squeeze trade. With GME, we have given the company a great opportunity to raise funds and pivot, but its future depends on management. We bankrupted Melvin. That is our achievement. Our goal is hitting the crooks on the other side of these trades: Citadel, SAC, Robinhood, etc. The company is just the football in this game.\n\nTwo interesting companies are Teradata Corp and Allogene Therapeutics Inc. These are short squeeze opportunities as well. TDC, has a 105.98% institutional and a 19.46% short interest with a cap of 2.9billion. TDC is almost 4x bigger than BOOM, so it will be harder to move with lower beta and a lower institutional so moves will have less impact. ALLO, has a 61.46% institutional and a 19.52% short interest with a cap of 4.9billion. Price action is not aggressive either but Allogen 8x bigger than BOOM and could be much harder to move.\n\nAfter looking at these and several other candidates, I found the best option, one that I believe could be successful in less than 3 days. It is DMC Global Inc. (NASDAQ:BOOM)\n\n1. **DMC has 114.49% institutional hold** \\- this means that there are hedge funds that have big short positions on this stock, many of which are naked. Naked shorts create the phantom shares representing 15% more than the float. Naked short is when you short the stock and the lender who let you short sell the stock actually didn\u2019t deliver the stock to you. This creates phantom shares. *Let me say that again:* there are 115% of the issued shares in play, that extra 15% in play *does not exist, but is owed*. These shares have been short sold without actually having shares to sell.\n2. **DMC has 17.46% Short Interest**, so pretty heavily shorted. This means that pushing the stock up will squeeze that like a big zit on a small face.  This is way bigger % than NOK and BB who have a little zit on a big face.\n3. **The market cap is just around 1 billion**. It won\u2019t take huge volume to squeeze this one.\n4. Other interesting features are a) **beta of 1.3**. The stock historically moves more than the market and b) recent price moves are up, but the **stock hasn\u2019t had any crazy big run**, so there is a lot of room to push this up really fast. c) fyi: DMC has a real business manufacturing metal parts and accessories using explosives for the energy industry,\n5. **It trades under ticker BOOM. This is a poetic bonus for this story.**\n\nAfter looking at these and lots of others. I concluded that the best play is BOOM, it\u2019s just like a ripe cherry waiting to be picked. I can find no better chance of success than this: a perfectly sized company that is as leveraged and as owned by hedgies as this. **I put this out for everyone and let the WSB mods decide.** The situation won\u2019t stay like this for long in these volatile markets, so if we decide to act, it must be now. Let\u2019s make this week another one for the history books. This is our moment. Let\u2019s change the world, one BOOM at a time!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Edit**: Position long: GME, BOOM, G bee tee cee, NO SHORTS and NO UNDIES EITHER.",

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nWith the price of Silver going up (I'm not going to speculate on whether there is a short squeeze), there are a lot of silver companies who's price mimic that of silver. \n\nI've done a lot of research to figure out which companies are being missed and I think I found a winner.\n\nIntegra Resources ($ITRG) is a Canadian mining company that's been growing lately. It started on the Toronto Stock Exchange and now has a foothold in the United States. It's price is currently at $3.26, but it has been following the price of silver since it's been public. \n\nThis is a small cap company (197 million), but it's spent the past year expanding its operations in silver mines. It's even gone on to acquire a large positions (5%+) in an old established Mining company that's seen better days ($CDE, used to be $200 - $300 WAY back in the day, currently trades at $11.85). I personally believe that there will be an acquisition or merger between these two companies at some point in the future.\n\nThough most silver companies are following in step with Silver, this one is lagging behind. With silver jumping over the weekend, this company hasn't moved pre-market, but it should catch up within the next day or so. At the rate that it's followed silver, I believe that a $6 or $7 target by the end of the month is doable. I believe this is the value play on the silver pump.\n\nPositions - 78 shares at $3.37. Planning on buying more on Market Open.",

        "selftext": "not spam - reposting helpful info from Saturday\n\nTo break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:\n\nAMC current status (30JAN2021) :\nAMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) \n\nNow what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. \n\nToday\u2019s target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)\n\nSo Monday when they\u2019re forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. \n\nBut this isn\u2019t even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.\n\nOver the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. \n\nShort squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there\u2019s a lot more room to grow. On the high end we\u2019re talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday",

        "selftext": "I have a serious question. So, assume some hedge funds have large short positions in a stock (GME, if you will).\n\nNow there seems to be no standard time after which they have to cover their position. They have to pay interest, and that interest will be higher the higher the price of the stock is, which will hurt them, surely. But as long as whoever they borrowed the shares from doesn't want them back, they don't have to cover, right?\n\nAssume all shares are shorted once, so exactly 100% short interest. Market cap of GME is almost 23 billion right now, so if they need to pay 10% interest (per year), that's 2.3 billion per year, or 44 million a week.\n\nSo, what if whoever they borrowed the shares from happily takes those 44 million a week and lets them keep the shares? They could just wait it out. If they wait for half a year, it costs them a billion, but who knows if all the retail investors will have the patience to wait that long? A lot of them might eventually close their position, with a profit, and they can buy back much cheaper than if they'd buy back now.\n\nThe whole squeeze thing seems to bank on them having to cover their position, which there seems to be no automatic mechanism for or no fixed time frame.",

        "selftext": "\\[Update\\] Posting here  \\[WSBN\\] as WSB did not allow me to.\n\n\\[Update 2\\] Do not listen to news that talk about Silver or any other catalyst. It is part of their distraction plan. Expect DIPS, BIG DIPs. Understand that they will try to scare the hell out of us and bring it as low as possible.\n\nLink to [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/l7po3s/situation_from_europe_plan_for_next_days_and/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFellow retards,\n\nAllow me to keep sharing my thoughts with you as it clears my mind and it gives me a path forward.\n\nAlso, I see that a lot of people lost here, missing basic knowledge on the stock market. I hope this adds a new perspective that helps you grow as a trader.\n\nNow, first, understand that I am in no way giving you any financial advise. You must do your own DD, understand your financial situation and take decisions based on your own research. I am just an autist that is most likely wrong so you should just read this for fun.\n\n## What to take into account on the current bet\n\nThere are three pillars in the current trade\n\n* Owners of stocks holding\n   * This caps how many shares are available, causing lack of liquidity (necessary for a short squeeze)\n* High Short interest remaining  (30-50+M)\n   * Main requirement for a short squeeze\n* Buys strength (retailer or institutional)\n   * To keep removing liquidity and pushing the price up (which triggers a gamma and short squeeze)\n\n# Short interest (SI) situation\n\nThis section is going to be complex, there is a lot of ground to cover, but hopefully you will get my point.\n\n## What we DO know\n\nSI is published every 15 days. The last time NYSE released GME SI data was on Jan 15th. All the information in between is based on different algorithms that companies such as ORTEX and S3Partners. These results might be wrong.\n\nAs of 15th of January the data was: 61.78m Shorts - 131.76%\n\n[FYI, DTC is totally misleading for GME. Ignore that number](https://preview.redd.it/2xrzp52g3ue61.png?width=349&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa27ab67688a290b0984144a3105e6902a9b76a8)\n\nNext time we will hear about SI will be on the **9th of February** [according to the NYSE calendar](https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/data/NYSE_Group_Short_Interest_Calendar.pdf). Remember this date for later.\n\n# Jan 22-29th RECAP - Understand where do we stand before setting expectations for next week\n\n**JAN 22-26th** AFAIK, a fair amount of -old- Shorts were covered on the squeeze that happened on Jan 25th and 26th (Tuesday) which helped rocket GME price from $50 to $250.\n\n[The first 350M volume was followed by an avg. of 145M+ the next two day. It is likely that many Short positions closed](https://preview.redd.it/f1ip3z2l3ue61.png?width=882&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f30113682c228e83904fc28a9877314f1b214ff3)\n\nNow, those Shorts, according to Ortex and S3Partners were replaced with new ones too. Something that -according to me- it is quite reasonable, as we will see below.\n\n**JAN 27-29th** On Jan 27th (Wed) after our friend Elon tweeted GameStonks!, New opened Shorts positions trembled. The MarketMaker(MM) forced to cover Call options as the price skyrocket (gamma squeeze) and Shorts covering pushed the price from $220 to $380.\n\nJan 26th aside, I believe the 27th was the biggest retail day with massive internet coverage and stock purchases.\n\n[Week event - Melvin Capital could say whatever, I do not believe it, and even if I would, well, as sure as hell they reopened new shorts \\(them or others\\)](https://preview.redd.it/i6b61z6w3ue61.png?width=753&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=418599684c1ca7179a990ada9ef7565e4bccdbcd)\n\nWe cannot be certain of how many Shorts remained after the market closed on Jan 27th (Wed). Regardless, with such home-run, **the HUGE squeeze was imminent.** Do not be fooled, there was no other legit reason to close retail traffic on Jan 28th when the price hit $500 (check what my best friend ever [IBKR Thomas P.](https://streamable.com/ycdec9)  said about it).\n\nThis makes me believe that at least 40+M shorts were still hanging in there.\n\n## WowowW, but wait, What happened with the volume?\n\nThe volume has massively gone down **and I take that as a real dam good sign**. From the initial 350M we have gone down to the 25M as of Friday 29th.\n\nOn Thursday, the short ladders had barely 2-4M in volume. Day volume was 34M.\n\nThis -to me- means that Retail might own a bigger chunk of the pie than we expected. **Easy 20M shares that Retail Holds and no way is going to fucking sell.**\n\n# So now what? What is the Short Interest situation?\n\nIf there is something that I have learn from the last days research is this: **SHORT INTEREST DATA is** \\- for GME most likely - **MANIPULATED.**\n\nIn the past week, we have seen nasty plays. Short ladders, retailers blocked from buying, and fake news and now... -in my opinion- short positions estimation manipulation.\n\nLong story short, I have seen a sudden HUGE change on the short interest estimates out of the blue on both ORTEX and S3Partners. Luckily, S3Partners had been very vocal and very public about the news related to short positions which has helped me consolidate the idea that currrent estimates are bullshit.\n\nIn less than 12h, S3Partners has gone from  their ***Hey mates! we still see 58+M shorts!\"*** to ***\"Well, markets are fluid and I am not gonna give you any data but be scared because a lot of Shorts are closed\"***. This [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356017621649383426) is pretty pathetic/fun to read.\n\n# Play for the next 2 weeks\n\nDuring the past week, you thought you sweated and shitted your pants like a master and, over everything else, you consider yourself a \ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32. Well, you are not, at least, not yet.\n\n## Shorts play - How I think they will manipulate Retai\n\nHere is the thing. If I were them, what would I do? I would have covered as many shorts as possible as low as possible by Friday 29th and would have made special deals so I can keep my game on.\n\nThe first week of February I would open a shit ton of new Shorts because I know that people, as much as they call themselves retards, on the deep inside they are paper hands and they will sell as the time passes.\n\nThen on the 9th with the next Short Interest NYSE report showing 20-30M shorts and all reddit full of bots giving the news of the Armageddon, all of Retail will run to hit the sell to market button as the explosive diarrea ruins their ergonomic gamer chairs and few of them make 3 or 4 bucks.\n\nAnd Retail fools will be left holding the bags while I would recover all the money I have lost in the previous weeks/squeezes as the price sinks to $2\n\n**THINK!!!** If you were them, would you not open shorts like a fucking demon at top prices? 420, 500, 470, 350, 320. We have seen many resistance points with plenty of volume and we have not really broken it.\n\nThey have 2 top opportunities to win. Sink the price next week so everyone sells or control the price raise until the new NYSE report comes out and gives bad news.\n\nIf I had to bet, I would say they will do both.\n\nLook at this: MUST VIEW: [`https://www.youtube.com/embed/QFfjX8dW-QQ`](https://www.youtube.com/embed/QFfjX8dW-QQ)\n\n## But mate, Is Retail big enough to keep this going?\n\nA big chunk of GameStop is owned by Blackrock and other huge wales. They are going to be rich as fuck and yes, they can do deals under the table. So what.\n\nBy no short of imagination -according to my estimates- they can prevent the squeeze from happening. Retail owns at least 20+M shares. I have seen numbers that say that retail only owns 13%. NO WAY. Last week, 500k-1M+  people jumped into GME. Some buying fractions, some buying few stocks and some buying tens or hundreds.\n\n**Even at a low average of 20 Retail easily owns 15M-20M+ shares .**  Taking into account the shares owned by funds that GME just as part of the portfolio and the insider ownership, my estimate is that **there are around 20-30M shares available to trade.**  Do not be fooled by the volume. The same stock could be traded 10 times, still one stock cannot close 10 shorts.\n\n## What will I do\n\nThis is war. Personally, I am financially strong. I doubled my account in the past 6 months so I keep having money to through at this.\n\nI'll continue to Buy DIPs and HOLD and I will be very careful to believe the information that is published that it is not official and based on estimates. \"Information\" is the wales game. They play it however they want, so better use some logic -like the one above- to understand how to play my cards.\n\nAll the people around me, tell me I am fucking crazy. That I should get the gains or put a stop loss. But being a trader is going against what other think or do. Is about having your dam plan clear, based on your believes an executing it.\n\n## Exit strategy\n\nI am more and more inclined to just do some \ud83c\udf7fseat-back and watch how it keeps climbing. Now, there will be dips as the rocket refuels, but there ain't stopping it. Maybe sell some at 15k? This is so big, that I have no idea.\n\nIf it SINKs, I'll just never sell, I'll pass them to my sons when I die with the promise that they will never sell.\n\n## Interactive brokers Update\n\nTaking into account how much they have fucked me already, I trust them shit. Should I have had paper hands I will be out of the game long ago (I could not buy again until Friday, where I bought in the last minutes).\n\nFor Europe, I fear there is no real alternative. So, braze yourselves.\n\n## Final disclaimer\n\nDo not follow what I said here, just because you liked it. Do you DD, understand you financial situation and do not fuck yourself over a bet. As probable as it might seem there is always a chance for all to go to shit. Do not allow yourself to be in a bankrupt risk.\n\nI am not a financial advisor, I do not have the knowledge nor do I want to be one. I am simply sharing my thoughts, but I can be completely wrong and it would not be the first time. Be safe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know in the comments if you have any correction or additional information and I will keep this post up to date.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/user/DeepFuckingValue/) In the name of those who will YOLO, we salut you.\n\nREF: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l78uct/gme\\_yolo\\_update\\_jan\\_28\\_2021/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l78uct/gme_yolo_update_jan_28_2021/)\n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32 and fucking GME \ud83d\ude80 to Alpha centaury.",

        "selftext": "Over the weekend, it\u2019s become clear that restrictions on Robinhood\u2019s margin requirements for settling transactions with clearinghouses was the primary reason why buying in some stocks were and are restricted.\n\nI\u2019m not suggesting lube wasn\u2019t also used or not used between Citadel and Robinhood, but this technical liquidity requirement is a big deal. It\u2019s also important to remember that Robinhood is a startup and the demand in our prized GME and AMC was a shock to multiple brokerages.\n\nHERE IS THE POINT: Our movement is driven by retail investors, and Robinhood is the home to the greatest volume of dating trading retail investors. Based on a conversation in Clubhouse yesterday, it appears that Robinhood has addressed their liquidity issues and should be able to unrestrict the stocks soon.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re on Robinhood, get ready to buy and BUY THE INEVITABLE DIP CAUSED BY ARTIFICIAL BUY RESTRICTIONS.\n\nBecause as soon as restrictions are lifted, the #1 stock trading app in the world for retail traders will effectively be lifting capital costs currently impacting many billions of dollars that would be flying into AMC and GME right now. \n\nYou are also very encouraged to transition your funds to other platforms in order to benefit from artificially low pricing. Because, even if our prized stonks appreciate 250% over the next couple days, you can know that most \ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d don\u2019t know how to change brokerages and it will at least take time.\n\nYOU NEED TO HOLD \ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\ude4c , because our movement\u2019s capital is artificially restricted for the moment or is in the middle of relocating to other brokerages.\n\nAND DON\u2019T PANIC. \ud83e\udd8d can breathe on the \ud83c\udf1a.",

        "selftext": "Hear me out! I would never ask that you sell GME, AMC etc. but do think everyone should be aware of MAC and all of the tremendous things it has going on. \n\n**First**, it is heavily shorted (over 60%), and the Wall Street thugs have been winning the last few days. This is unacceptable and we need WSB to join in the support even if people just buy 1 $16 share. \n\n**Second**, this is insanely undervalued! Whereas GME and AMC need a bunch of things to occur for them to get back on a strong profitable path, MAC is already on one. Morningstar has a $32.50 Price target in the short term on MAC and MAC also turned down a $92 buyout offer a few years ago by SPG, so clearly management (who own a ton of shares) believe they are worth more. \n\n**Third**, they just announced they have strong terms in the financial market to refi at low rates, which will boost FFO. \n\n**Fourth**, their rent collections and occupancy are sitting right below where they were pre-pandemic and their rent per square foot is higher. If they were able to do this well during a PANDEMIC and after being SHUT DOWN then imagine what a full year back to normal would look like. Their malls are being certified as safe for COVID, something many places cannot say.\n\n**Fifth**, they are home to amazing stores...think TESLA, APPLE, LULULEMON, GAMESTOP, AMC etc. \n\n**Sixth**, Malls ARE NOT DYING. Sure crappy class B/C malls are going bankrupt, but MAC has Class A malls in most of the major cities with the highest population densities surrounding them. Less B/C malls means that all of the people that want to shop will be forced to make the drive to MACs clean, fun, upscale malls! As vaccines roll out and covid simmers down all of the pent up demand to go out and do things will be a major boost for their malls.\n\n**Seventh**, they are not just tied to shops anymore. They are partnered with Google to build a new campus in California [https://www.macerich.com/About/News/676889](https://www.macerich.com/About/News/676889) and they have leased a converted Sears space to a additional space for a nearby hospital [https://www.macerich.com/About/News/728289](https://www.macerich.com/About/News/728289). In DC they have used some of their mall RE and converted it into apartments [https://investing.macerich.com/news-releases/news-release-details/macerich-announces-opening-vita-residences-tysons-corner-center](https://investing.macerich.com/news-releases/news-release-details/macerich-announces-opening-vita-residences-tysons-corner-center). I wouldn't be surprised if they use any remaining vacant big box stores to lease out distribution center to Amazon.\n\n**In summary,** the land these malls sit on are probably alone worth more than the current market cap. They are not at risk of going out of business AT ALL and instead are growing in so many different ways. Management is smart and creative. They have survived the pandemic and now the sky is the limit.

        "selftext": "**Episode 2: Using Options to protect your crown jewels when the market starts to fall**\n\nThere are many ways in which Options can be traded, for income, profit, loss, insurance or to subsidise a Stock purchase and in this, the 2nd of my introductory series on Options, I\u2019ve decided to going to cover off why you might want to buy a PUT on either an individual stock or indices to cover and protect your \u2018long\u2019 positions.\n\nSo what is a PUT exactly?\n\nAt its simplest a PUT is a type of Option you buy (or *sell* \\- see Episode 3 next Monday) which can make you money when a stock or the market is going down. (NB: You don\u2019t actually need to own a stock to buy a PUT, it just depends on whether you want to run around the market \u2018sans underwear\u2019 and risk your private assets for no good reason \u2013 other than profit! :-) Joking aside however, the purpose of this post is to explain how the financial \u2018instrument\u2019 known as a PUT - loved and hated in equal measure, can be used for the purpose for which it was originally conceived.\n\nTiming is pretty much everything when working with the stock market and that becomes 100 x more critical when you start trading Options. Buying a PUT at the wrong time (i.e. when the market or your stock is going upwards) is unlikely to win you many admirers and can be detrimental to your relationship if you have a shared brokerage account! J But as I mentioned in the first Episode of this series on the Covered CALL, a single Option = 100 shares; a relationship often referred to as \u2018leverage.\u2019 As such, and if you had 100 shares in Apple for example, another trader could achieve a similar holding ON A TIME LIMITED BASIS for just 1% of the money you paid for those Apple shares (less spread and commission); tempting isn\u2019t it - $13,000 odd of stock for just $1,300. The problem however, is that at some point in the future (and unlike the Stock), an Option expires and then becomes valueless \u2013 a time few investors relish. Also, when multiple Options expire at the same time it\u2019s known as a \u2018Witching\u2019 or even a triple Witching when stock Options, stock index futures and stock index options expire at the same time - Fun, fun, fun for the boys and girls on their Option broomsticks sans underwear, but not do good for anyone else! :-)\n\nOn the plus side however, and with a 99% theoretical leverage on your money, a PUT will gain value rapidly whenever the market or the stock it relates too goes down, and even after taking the \u2018spread\u2019 into account (that\u2019s the difference between the \u2018buy\u2019 and the \u2018sell\u2019 price of the Option) it typically delivers anywhere from a 65: 1 to 75:1 return (profit or loss), so it\u2019s a cheap way to insure your portfolio against a V shaped dip. It would be fair to say that PUT purchased and sold for the right reasons *at the right time* can go a long way towards protecting your crown jewels (Stocks) against temporary stock market downdrafts, and at the wrong time is a ruddy nuisance J\n\nSo what\u2019s the catch?\n\nThere\u2019s more than one actually :-)  Firstly, neither stocks nor indices tend to travel up or down in nice predictable patterns \u2013 if they did, we\u2019d all be minted by now and I probably wouldn\u2019t these articles from the cupboard under the stairs! :-)\n\nWhen you buy a PUT, it will bounce around your ticker from red to green (and then back to red again), :-) in much the same way that you would if you suddenly decided to take a stroll across a hot bed of coals to impress your friends here on Reddit, and just like those hot coals and your pretty little feet, it\u2019s painful, unnerving and it doesn\u2019t smell too good either! :-) But joking aside, let\u2019s run some scenarios to show how this defensive strategy might not do what you\u2019d like it to do;\n\na) Imagine your stock takes a sharp dive and up goes your PUT (65: 1 after the spread). You call your Partner and rave about your natural genius and unrivalled flare, but by the time the phone call ends and you return to your screen, you discover that the Stock has actually recovered and that pesky PUT you were just raving about has sent your ticker back in the red again! (what's the betting you don\u2019t ring them back and confess your sins!?) J (I appreciate you could put a STOP order SELL order on your Options but due to the ways these things bounce around, it\u2019s not always an ideal strategy to do so \u2013 see b) for why.\n\nor\n\nb) Maybe your stock takes that proverbial dive again but this time bottoms out and bounces along the floor for a few minutes, then you see the candlesticks starting to change, confirming that the recovery is imminent so you sell your PUT on a wave of GREEN \u2013 Yipee! J - Only to discover that for reasons unknown, the candle has melted and your Stock is now launching itself off a vertical cliff with all your money to oblivion! You start to wonder if the PUT *knew* it was about to be dumped and in a last act of revenge at your unfaithfulness, waited till the last possible moment when you had taken off the parachute before sticking in the boot? (It happens believe me, and it\u2019s a very weird feeling when it does, as if someone at the brokerage firm (aka Casino) was watching your moves and had set you up) . . . :-)\n\nBut please don\u2019t be put off (no pun intended - honest) J Buying a PUT can be a great idea, and when successfully deployed can protect your assets against downdraughts in both theory and in practice, but working with one is not as straight forward as anyone would like; it\u2019s a bit like riding a Tandem (bicycle) with a drunk co-pilot in the lead, you both know timing is everything and where you want to get too, but getting there seems frustratingly elusive (and you keep falling off in the road!) :-)\n\nA PUT can and will protect you and it\u2019s a great defensive play but don\u2019t stay in one for too long unless you know that crash in your assets is both imminent and ongoing! Timing remember is everything (x100) and walking on hot coals hurts!\n\nNext Monday, I\u2019ll take a closer look at using a PUT as a way to buy an underlying stock you want and get paid for the privilege, but until then; stay safe \u2018guys\u2019 and watch the market right now, it\u2019s looking a bit choppy out there.

Even more interesting it's price structure.\n\nAnd had Three points to consider:\n\nFirst - price structure with Gann swings;\n\nSecond - momentum and dynamics with Gann angles;\n\nThird - most important is Time cycles that i discovered universally applicable to any stock or commodity or currency.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ho3i00omue61.jpg?width=1356&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed1b9984e1540ed375b36ac3f9754ca554e0bd0d\n\nThe reason why time is most important is that price can be at low levels or in consolidation for a long time, and you never know whether it will resume trend next week or next month or 3-6 months.\n\nYou stay in uncertainty all this time and money are frozen in the stock. Time cycle helps to assume particular weeks and dates for change in dynamics, so even if price is low or sideways - unless Time comes you don't jump in.\n\nAlso unless Time comes you don\u2019t expect the trend to stop.\n\nSo Nano Vibronix:\n\n1.

Gann angle from November 2020 is just at current levels around 1.1 and unless price stays above it - stock is strong and has opportunity to strengthen more to next levels on upper side; Gann angle from recent bottom is trending and support last two days at 1.08 and if wee stay above this low it imply fast reaction up, I home this week but  if Thursday low at 1.08 stays.\n\nThere is final support can be at 0.90 below which we can again forget the stock for some time, while above 0.90 it will still save opportunity to strengthen, but it will require more weeks to accumulate strength again. So now it can be close stop below Thursday with anticipation of move up till March-April when many stocks will top, to consolidate till August at least.\n\n3. Time cycles: Nearest time cycle date was 28 Jan - exact low at 1.08.\n\nNext time dates are in middle of February, if price soars too rapid I would cover at least partially, while if it will be low - more fuel will be added for stock to go up till beginning of March 2021.\n\nFinal thoughts - I would watch the stock in the nearest days and not crossing down 1.08. Than if it goes above 1.25 will confirm strength. Only final thing on its way up will be 200 moving average around 1.32 and we need to cross it more that 3 points and also close above this 200 moving average.\n\nNext price level will be high of 1.77 and we need to stabilise around it to go higher.\n\nAt the same time around 20 February plus-minus few days we will watch whether it is top to fix or bottom to add; I will be updating the situation by then if this kind of analysis is of interest upvote :)\n\n^(Note, that this analysis is for informational purpose and does not encourage to buy or to sell mentioned stock or commodity, especially blindly.

With a pipeline with proven  efficacy and  safety like $SLS's, and a cash position of $40M, and a  $202M licensing  deal exclusive 10% of royalties for the greater China,  how can a $80M  Market Cap be anywhere close to fair value?\n\nWhile   one-trick-pony $GLSI has a MC of $500M?

The govt even gave a $53M contract.\n2) Last quarter revenue increased by 233% quarter on quarter (not year on year!)\n3) Very little debt on balance sheet. No chance of bankruptcy\n4) Profitable. Consistently.\n5) It is an absolute bargain: At annualized last quarter earnings (which should only increase now with vaccines being rolled out), it is trading at a PE of 15. Read that again: price multiple of annualized earnings is 15 for a company growing at over 200%.\n6) The short interest on this is 36%. Can\u2019t fathom what the short thesis is. But in a time like this, it\u2019s ripe for a squeeze.\n7) 60%+ of the stock is held by insiders. And the CEO has been buying up more shares consistently for the last two years - and not sold a single one.

        "selftext": "Greetings, fellow hedgefund hitmen! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nAs we all had to see over the past days, due to the massive amount of new posts that WSB receives right now, audio ist mostly blocked on our memes by AutoMod. Which sucks. You can see Jordan Belfort, but you can\u2019t hear him not fucking leaving. Also, people put in hours of work just to see their 10/10 meme being stripped off of its perfection because there\u2019s no sound. I felt that this was a huge waste of quality material.\n\nThat is why over the past days, I went through the pain of reconnecting video and audio manually, meme by meme. I have compiled the best memes into bigger videos so that you can watch them in one go, and if you feel like checking out the original creator and source on WSB, I have always linked the OG reddit posts below. You can check out all of them [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQXi-2y3UILN8M8_uzhLDXQ), I am regularly adding new ones.\n\nHope this helps, apes together strong! \ud83c\udf4c\ud83d\udc12\ud83d\udc12 \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50\ud83d\udc50",

Can buy 350 shares  and more Gamestock too sky is the limit \n\n\nOkay  my take is today the price will be rocky, they will try tempt people to sell , if that does not work they will cross trade with each other at low rates to make the price fall artificially , meanwhile this costs them millions in interest , so they may even try this for a day or 2, so the next 2 days the price may show low, then they will crack and we go to the moon\n\nImportant in big dips buy ,DD\n\nUpdate Finviz shows 43.82% short float they are waiting for us to crack , do not panic hold on they are  really panicking \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude1c\n\nDuring the next few days there will be many dips and highs it tricks so you sell be aware hold out til Thursday is my take, they will take up to circa 35%  up today  and to a negative to try shake us before they crack, this I expect until Thursday. \n\nYou can check Finviz   site for AMC  right now you will see short float at  about 44%, which means they are playing cool with their backs to the wall.\n\nWallstreet is putting out fake news  , adverts in apps ,about  G ame and AMC to panic you sit back and relax it means they are on the run\n\nThis is called a short ladder attack it is just pretend sales , by hedge funds , nothing is really sold its fake to bring the price down., They tried it on GAme too \ud83e\udd23\n\nSit back and relax til Thursday evening or Friday\n\nHere you are hundreds of trades all fake done in milliseconds they are playing but they cannot  this after friday\n\nhttps://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/amc/latest-real-time-trades",
