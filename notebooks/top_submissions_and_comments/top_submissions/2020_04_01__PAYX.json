        "selftext": "PAYX does payroll servicing and HR for small businesses, who are getting screwed by both the virus and the government at the moment. They make money for every paycheck they send out - which is going to be a lot less currently because workers are all staying inside their homes.\n\nSmall businesses are also getting the short end of the stick compared to large corporations when it comes to the money printer.\n\nIn addition to all their clients being boned, take a look at their [balance sheet](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PAYX/balance-sheet?p=PAYX). They have (around) 5 billion in total current liabilities and only 700 million in cash. This yahoo finance data is about a year old and I can't be bothered to investigate further though.\n\nVolume is shit but who cares you'll print. **TLDR Paychex is screwed. $PAYX 6/19 45 or 40 puts**",

Thinking &amp; waiting for the quarterly drop.. I made a good profit but I was scared I was going to lose money on the next crash. I\u2019ve been waiting but I\u2019m thinking I should go back in as soon as the market opens this Monday. Most likely acquiring the same stocks &amp; then some. \n\nMy question is, what should I do? \nShould I wait for a crash, is there a crash coming?\nOr should I just go buy in &amp; not worry about it &amp; look at it as a long term &amp; just forget about my purchases. \n\nI only know so much, yet so little from a far cousin out of state but I feel I have harassed him long enough so I bring my questions here.  \n\nI want to get as much information as I can get; if given good advice, I\u2019m looking to stay in the stock business &amp; stay here. I\u2019m ready to make smart investments &amp; stick to the Gun &amp; Butter theory. \n\nAll in all, I\u2019m open to any type of information.",
