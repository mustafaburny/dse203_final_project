I hoped to capitalize on the coming of next gen consoles this year. Sadly since I bought it the stocks price has been plummeting more each day. Is this a sell to minimize loses or hold out and buy more in hopes that by the end of the year i can take some gains?",

        "selftext": "I was thinking of the idea of using puts on a losing stock such as Gamestop or Macy's as a way to hedge in a crash.  The idea is, something like Gamestop will probably go down in the next year.  However, if the market crashes it will only accelerate the decline.  This means I can make money in both cases.  \n\nI believe what I'm doing is \"hedging\" in an inherently riskier way: making money on Gamestop or Macy's puts is risky in a bull market.  This isn't like holding bonds: the shares are not guaranteed to fall.  However, there likely is a better than 50% chance to make money on these puts.  However, if there is a crash, the situation will be even better, and the likelihood of success will be higher.  \n\nWhat do you think of this strategy?",
