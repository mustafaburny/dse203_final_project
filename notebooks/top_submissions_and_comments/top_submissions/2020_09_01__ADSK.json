        "selftext": "Goldman:\n\n\"**Growth is more valuable to investors than ever in the low interest rate environment that is likely to persist for years.** Rates at the lower bound enhance the net present value of stocks with strong expected long-term growth. Growth has outperformed Value during the past 1, 3, 5, and 10 years. High growth stocks now trade at the largest valuation premium to low growth stocks in 20 years. Short-term disruptions may occur but investor demand for secular growth will persist.\"\n\n\"**This report refreshes our \"Rule of Ten\" secular growth analysis and highlights 21 firms in the S&amp;P 500 with the potential to be future index leaders**. These stocks will not necessarily supplant the current five largest stocks. But they have the potential to significantly increase their index rankings from the current median of 154, generating strong returns for portfolio managers along the way. From a sector perspective, Information Technology, Health Care, and Communication Services account for 19 of our 21 Rule of Ten stocks. The median stock has expected 2018-2022 annualized sales growth of 18% (vs. 4% for the S&amp;P 500), trades at 43x 2021E EPS (vs. 20x) and 9x EV/sales (vs. 3x), and has returned 21% YTD (vs. 0%).\"\n\n\"**Most of the stocks relate to five broad themes:** (1) Computerization of healthcare; (2) digital transformation of business; (3) workflow automation; (4) e-commerce and digital payments; and (5) advancements in life sciences.\"\n\n\"Among those five themes, we highlight potential \"future five\" stocks that our equity analysts believe have compelling secular growth opportunities: **ISRG, ADSK, NOW, PYPL, VRTX**.

        "selftext": " Dassault Syst\u00e8mes  provides software solutions and services worldwide such as  SOLIDWORKS  design software for 3D design,  electrical and printed circuit board design, product data management, simulation, manufacturing, and technical communication and CATIA, an engineering and design software for product 3D computer-aided design. Autodesk offers similar products but from all the reviews I've read online solidworks and catia are better for engineering compared to autodesks autocad and inventor platfroms. DASTY seems to be more diversified though and acquired  Medidata Solutions in the past year which is an American technology company that develops and markets software as a service (SaaS) for clinical trials. These include protocol development, clinical site collaboration and management; randomization and trial supply management; capturing patient data through web forms, mobile health (mHealth) devices, laboratory reports, and imaging systems; quality monitor management; safety event capture; and monitoring and business analytics. \n\nI can't find much discussion on the topic as Dassault Systemes doesn't seem to be a very popular stock in the US. In my opinion they seem like the better play compared to autodesk as they are targeting the medical field as well which could be incredibly lucrative as more medical companies embrace modernization.",

        "selftext": "Goldman:\n\n\"**Growth is more valuable to investors than ever in the low interest rate environment that is likely to persist for years.** Rates at the lower bound enhance the net present value of stocks with strong expected long-term growth. Growth has outperformed Value during the past 1, 3, 5, and 10 years. High growth stocks now trade at the largest valuation premium to low growth stocks in 20 years. Short-term disruptions may occur but investor demand for secular growth will persist.\"\n\n\"**This report refreshes our \"Rule of Ten\" secular growth analysis and highlights 21 firms in the S&amp;P 500 with the potential to be future index leaders**. These stocks will not necessarily supplant the current five largest stocks. But they have the potential to significantly increase their index rankings from the current median of 154, generating strong returns for portfolio managers along the way. From a sector perspective, Information Technology, Health Care, and Communication Services account for 19 of our 21 Rule of Ten stocks. The median stock has expected 2018-2022 annualized sales growth of 18% (vs. 4% for the S&amp;P 500), trades at 43x 2021E EPS (vs. 20x) and 9x EV/sales (vs. 3x), and has returned 21% YTD (vs. 0%).\"\n\n\"**Most of the stocks relate to five broad themes:** (1) Computerization of healthcare; (2) digital transformation of business; (3) workflow automation; (4) e-commerce and digital payments; and (5) advancements in life sciences.\"\n\n\"Among those five themes, we highlight potential \"future five\" stocks that our equity analysts believe have compelling secular growth opportunities: **ISRG, ADSK, NOW, PYPL, VRTX**.

        "selftext": " Dassault Syst\u00e8mes  provides software solutions and services worldwide such as  SOLIDWORKS  design software for 3D design,  electrical and printed circuit board design, product data management, simulation, manufacturing, and technical communication and CATIA, an engineering and design software for product 3D computer-aided design. Autodesk offers similar products but from all the reviews I've read online solidworks and catia are better for engineering compared to autodesks autocad and inventor platfroms. DASTY seems to be more diversified though and acquired  Medidata Solutions in the past year which is an American technology company that develops and markets software as a service (SaaS) for clinical trials. These include protocol development, clinical site collaboration and management; randomization and trial supply management; capturing patient data through web forms, mobile health (mHealth) devices, laboratory reports, and imaging systems; quality monitor management; safety event capture; and monitoring and business analytics. \n\nI can't find much discussion on the topic as Dassault Systemes doesn't seem to be a very popular stock in the US. In my opinion they seem like the better play compared to autodesk as they are targeting the medical field as well which could be incredibly lucrative as more medical companies embrace modernization.",
