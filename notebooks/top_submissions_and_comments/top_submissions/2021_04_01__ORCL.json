        "selftext": "For context, I'm 22, make $25/hr but have pretty much no bills since I live with my parents, so my risk tolerance is pretty high. I have about 55 shares of Tesla after \"un-diversifying\" and selling all my other stock. I'm pretty much all in. I cannot find any other company that i can put my money in where growth is seemingly inevitable. I do own bitcoin but what are some equities that I can purchase over the next few months, or all at once with 10k cash? \n\nI have a tiny % of my portfolio in Oracle, Trimble, Crispr, Upstart, Square, Paypal, to give you an idea of what types of stocks I'm attracted to. (data, fintech, autonomy). I'm averse to companies with binary outcomes like bio, pharma, etc. Any interesting leads? :)",

Growth outperformed value, though both factors saw good gains. Consumer discretionary was the leader with travel and leisure names faring well. Communications services performed well with FB and GOOGL strength. Tech was boosted by AAPL and MSFT. Energy was the only sector lower on the day. Treasuries were mostly firmer led by the five year point of the curve after rates saw some upward pressure on Good Friday when equities were closed. 10s finished above 1.70% again. Dollar weakened vs both yen and euro. Gold finished fractionally higher. WTI crude ended down 4.6%.\n   * **Market was largely supported by combination of upbeat recovery sentiment following better March employment data and fairly well behaved bond yields**. Nonfarm payrolls surged 916K, well above the 660K consensus, while net upward revisions to prior months totaled 156K. Economist takeaways were positive, highlighting the broad-based job creation, the room for further recovery over the next few months in the industries most adversely impacted by the pandemic and the lack of upward pressure on wages.

Also called on other nations to avoid pre-emptive fiscal tightening. **US vaccine outperformance continues** with seven-day average of 3M+ doses per day, seemingly overshadowing some concerns about a **potential fourth wave**.

Household employment increased 609K, the participation rate rose 0.1pp to 61.5% and the employment-population ratio increased 0.2pp to 57.8%. Average hourly earnings fell 0.1% m/m vs expectations for a 0.1% gain, with compositional changes flagged as an overhang. Economist takeaways were positive, highlighting the broad-based job creation (Goldman Sachs said industry breadth hit a 9-month high) and the further room for recovery over the next few months in the industries most adversely impacted by the pandemic. There was some discussion about a return to the pre-pandemic level of jobs by year-end.\n   * **ISM non-manufacturing index posted record high:**\n      * **ISM non-manufacturing index** for March soared to 63.7, beating 58.5 estimate and up from prior month 55.3.

His fund,\u00a0Blue Harbour, targeted undervalued \"small and midcap companies that could return 30 to 50 percent over a two- to three-year investment horizon\". Also \"Clifton Robbins doesn't invest in a company unless its management is receptive to his ideas.\"\n\nLet's get to it. These are the private companies I found where Cohn is a chairman or advisor.\u00a0  \n\n\n# 1) nanopay \u00a0\n\n# Canada based Fintech company serving customers in Canada, USA, Brazil\u00a0\n\n* Platform built using hybrid blockchain technology that combines features of blockchain and conventional databases. The result is a secure, tamper resistant, high performance platform that is low cost and easy to use.\u00a0\n* Much faster than any decentralized blockchain payments solution. Up to 50k transactions per second. At least 2,500x faster than decentralized blockchain solutions.\u00a0\n* End-to-end protection.

Worked for 3 years on the Federal Reserve\u2019s Faster Payment Task Force. \u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 2) Spring Labs\u00a0\n\n# California based start-up focused on secure/private information exchange\u00a0\n\n\u201cSpring Labs was founded by members of the founding team and board of Avant, a lending platform and technology company that has served more than 600,000 customers and originated nearly $5 billion of loans through the Avant platform. Avant was recently ranked the 5th most valuable Fintech startup worth over $1 billion by Inc. Magazine. Through building Avant, the Spring Labs team witnessed firsthand the misaligned incentives and security problems of today's credit and identity ecosystem. The company is looking to revolutionize the credit and identity sharing process through a decentralized network that enables a more transparent, efficient and secure model for sharing information related to identity and credit.\u201d \u00a0\n\nI don\u2019t believe they have a working product yet. Their plan is divided into 3 stages, here is my summary.\u00a0\n\n(Stage 01)\u00a0build proprietary applications within financial services. This phase will focus on solving industry-specific use cases to prove out utilization.\u00a0\n\n(Stage 02)\u00a0network development, partner with leading financial services institutions and produce dedicated applications via 3rd party development.\u00a0\n\n(Stage 03)\u00a03rd parties can build applications on the Spring Protocol via a self-service model without engaging directly with Spring Labs. This open platform will enable others to leverage our data anonymization and value exchange technology\u00a0\n\nStage 01 Apps:\u00a0Spring Protect, Spring Defend, Spring Verify\u00a0  \nStage 02 Apps:\u00a0National Mortgage Registry, International Bank Data Sharing, Telecom and Utility Data Sharing, Loan Registry (Industry-specific)\u00a0  \nStage 03 Apps:\u00a0HIPAA-Compliant Medical Record Exchange, Genomic Sequencing Data Exchange,\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSharing Economy Reputation Network,\u00a0US Auto/Mortgage Title Registry, Self-Sovereign Data Marketplace, Cross-Border Self-Sovereign Identity Service\u00a0\n\nOn the surface this company seems overly ambitious. But their team and advisors are so well qualified that it makes me believe in them. You be the judge. This industry needs more security, that\u2019s for sure. If you disagree please read this headline from Fox Business: \u201cFed's Powell warns cyber threats pose bigger danger to US economy than 2008-style financial crisis\u201d\u00a0\n\nTheir list of advisors is almost scary tbh.\u00a0\n\nGary Cohn - Former Director of the U.S. National Economic Council\u00a0\n\nSheila Bair - Former Chair of the FDIC\u00a0\n\nAndreas Beroutsos - Former Global Head of Financial Institutions at McKinsey\u00a0\n\nRaj Date - First-ever Deputy Director of the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)\u00a0\n\nRay Lane - Former President &amp; COO of Oracle\u00a0\n\nBobby Mehta - Former CEO of Transunion\u00a0\n\nNigel Morris - Co-founder of Capital One\u00a0\n\nManolo Sanchez - Former Chairman &amp; CEO of BBVA Compass\u00a0\n\nGuy Schory - Former Head of Strategic Initiatives at eBay &amp; PayPal\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLinks:\u00a0\n\n[https://www.springlabs.com/](https://www.springlabs.com/) \n\n[https://www.linkedin.com/company/springlabs/](https://www.linkedin.com/company/springlabs/) \n\nCuriously, the Executive Chairman seeded or was an early investor in Draftkings and Skillz\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 3) Hoyos Integrity\u00a0\n\n# Secure Technology Services Company based in Florida\u00a0\n\nThis company\u2019s tech is very, very solid. I believe they have a monopoly in they niche, and their niche is ever-growing. \u00a0\n\n\u201cHoyos Integrity combines the top handset developers with the leaders in biometrics and security to bring a new approach to mobile privacy to protect critical personal and corporate information and provide peace of mind. Hoyos Integrity executives &amp; engineers have designed, built, and shipped over 150 million phones in their tenures at Multinational Fortune 100 companies. \u00a0\n\nThe Founder/CEO, Hector Thaddeuss Hoyos, is a leader in the biometrics and IT industries. As the founder and president of various cutting-edge companies with extreme vision, he has created state-of-the-art tech such as fingerprint, face and iris identification systems, and interactive financial transaction systems. He holds 100+ patents issued/pending, co-created an IEEE standard (2410), and has developed solutions being used by millions of people around the world.\u00a0\n\n**Products:**\u00a0\n\n* **Hoyos Phone:**\u00a0Basically the most secure smartphone ever. Uses an OS that is not open and has zero vulnerabilities. Our devices run a military-grade, NSA certified operating system (Integrity 178B) that has not had a single hack in over 20 years of government use. Integrity 178B is the same OS that currently safeguards military and commercial aircraft, government agency systems, critical infrastructure and the US nuclear arsenal. The phones are USA made to monitor every aspect of the supply chain for QA, but also to ensure the chip in every Hoyos device is clean. \"We eliminate the threat of intrusion in the manufacturing process.\"\n* **Biometrics and Transactional Secure Systems (BATS):** (*Yes, it uses Blockchain technology*) BATS is the foundation of Hoyos\u2019 secured solutions. \"As traditional enterprise security stores ID data in a single location, it creates a single point of mass attack for hackers. With BATS, user data is secure, encrypted and it is architectured to have no single point of attack, increasing security by orders of magnitude.\"\n* **Hoyos Biometrika:**\u00a0Users never have to remember passwords or login information. Biometrika is device-agnostic and works with rear camera (Mano), front camera (Caras) and microphone (Voz). Comprehensive with liveness detection of user attempting to access device.\u00a0\n* **Hoyos Wallet:**\u00a0attached to the account owner\u2019s biometrics, the Hoyos Wallet is the ultimate authentication and encryption method that ties together advanced, multi-biometric security and control, the IEEE 2410 standard compliant BATS and the decentralized blockchain architecture. It significantly reduces a large attack surface down to a single user. A hacker would have to target a single user and capture exact biometric vectors that have been fused to the private key. \u00a0\n* **Frictionless Instant Payment System (FIPS):** built on Hoyos\u2019 Digital; assures privacy as no user data is mined; biometrically protects every transaction; holds any digital fiat or tokenized currency; is hot/online; and is fully regulatory compliant.\u00a0\n\nLinks:\u00a0\n\n[https://hoyosintegrity.com/](https://hoyosintegrity.com/) \n\n# 4) Gro Intelligence \n\nThis company **harvests large amounts of agricultural data** from around the world and **organizes it**. With all these data they can **identify and even forecast anything that could be driving the supply or the demand of agricultural products**.\u00a0\n\nThey collect data from: satellites, weather stations, govt agencies, commodity exchanges, trade organizations. Last year, the CEO said on an interview that they process over 800 trillion data points a day.\u00a0\n\nNow this company is really interesting and I'm sure Cathie Wood would love to invest on this one since it's definitely a disruptive innovator. Their technology can be used by any company that relies on agricultural products, which include companies in industries like chemical, pharmaceutical, manufacturing, textiles, food, etc. Other industries, like banks, can also find this data useful.\n\n[https://gro-intelligence.com/](https://gro-intelligence.com/about/team)  \n[https://youtu.be/RvVrizTKChU](https://youtu.be/RvVrizTKChU)[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/08/business/a-start-up-raises-money-in-a-bid-to-create-business-benchmarks-for-climate-risk.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/08/business/a-start-up-raises-money-in-a-bid-to-create-business-benchmarks-for-climate-risk.html)  \n\n\n# 5) Starling Trust\u00a0\n\n# Applied Behavioral Sciences Company based in Washington DC\u00a0\n\n\u201cStarling marries behavioral science and AI (Alternative Intelligence) to uncover the invisible team dynamics that drive organizational outcomes \u2014 allowing you to identify leading indicators of trouble and to spot where management intervention is likely to achieve success.

(OTCQB \u2013 RKFL)**\u00a0is poised to transform the global eCommerce industry, in our view. The Company is an early mover as a global provider of one-click online payment options using Bitcoin and dozens of other cryptocurrencies. Moreover, RocketFuel is the\u00a0first cryptocurrency payment service\u00a0to provide a seamless and elegant one-click checkout experience that today's digital and mobile-centric consumers have come to expect from eCommerce marketplaces, such as\u00a0**Amazon (NASDAQ \u2013 AMZN)**.\u00a0\n\nThe RocketFuel platform, based on patent-pending technology, enables merchants and consumers to easily complete payment for goods and services using 43 different cryptocurrencies or direct bank transfer in a completely secure environment. A significant benefit of the Company\u2019s approach is that the entire shopping cart checkout process can be executed via a distributed ledger or blockchain. Thus, merchant websites will no longer required to operate complex, and costly payment and check-out infrastructures. With the one-click checkout used on RocketFuel-partnered sites, consumers will enjoy unrivalled convenience .\n\nAs is typically the case with new technologies and applications with a broad scope, we expect early adopters to dominate usage during 2021 as online merchants shopping cart and payment solutions providers implement the crypto acceptance functionality, with mass market utilization occurring in 2022. With estimates suggesting that the number of (non-Facebook) crypto wallet holders will grow to 250M+ in the next 2-3 years, up from 68M today, substantial adoption lies ahead.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n***The Problem***\n\neCommerce has enjoyed wide, mainstream adoption and in many cases has emerged as the shopping method of choice for consumers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, for merchants and consumers alike, many of the payment system setups and associated technologies in place today have underlying issues, which in turn have a deleterious effect on merchant/consumer transaction execution.\n\nFor consumers, payment systems and shopping cart utilization can be awkward and clunky, require multiple steps and redirects to 3rd parties, and may not be secure, resulting in a less than stellar customer experience. For merchants, the current eCommerce payment infrastructure is even more problematic. In most cases, merchants are required to use an intermediary, costing billions in excess expenses annually. Roughly 1 in 5 carts leave without completing a transaction because consumers do not trust the merchant\u2019s system. Plus, in most cases, fees are high, payments are delayed, and exorbitant fees due to fraud, fraud prevention, and chargebacks related to the inefficient back-end operations can be excessive, reducing profits.\n\n***The Solution*** \n\nIn contrast, by leveraging modern blockchain technology and its proprietary platform, RocketFuel offers consumers a single-click pay solution, pay with crypto or direct bank transfer option with no redirects or filling out forms as the information is stored at once. The process is seamless-simple, efficient, secure, and convenient. Merchants generate higher shopping cart conversion, pay lower fees, have greater security, transparency, less fraud, and improved cash flow. With a better experience for both sides of the transaction, and improved order and shipping fulfillment, merchants can foster loyalty and generate recurring business.\u00a0\n\n***Today and Tomorrow***\n\nThe Company launched its first product in a live environment in March 2021 and with two travel merchant customers and a tax auditing firm in hand, management intends to continue to develop the check-out technology with several larger U.S. eCommerce merchants, social media and blogsites. With connections to several larger eCommerce merchants, near term sales and marketing efforts will focus on a few \u201cbig fish\u201d rather than many smaller merchants and will scale up initiatives as funding permits. We believe that the Company will also target specific verticals that may be a source of early adopters and crypto wallet holders in verticals such as online gambling, gaming, and with merchants selling high ticket items. In conjunction with this targeted approach, RocketFuel may utilize social media to generate awareness and attract consumer influencers. Given that the phase from early adoption to mass market adoption can take 12-18 months, we believe that the Company could enjoy exponential merchant sign-ups going forward, along with consumer utilization, from 2021-2022, with the greatest recurring platform utilization by consumers beginning in 2023.\u00a0\n\n***Financial Forecasts and Valuation***\n\nIt is difficult to accurately project the deployment and adoption success of a new technology and application such as the unique RocketFuel blockchain and crypto payment service.\u00a0 However, given the underlying growth rates in blockchain ledger utilization for financial and payment transactions, as well as the proliferation of crypto wallet adoption, it is clear that major upside exists. Widespread adoption and growth are further affirmed by the Company\u2019s underlying offering which solves major unmet needs in eCommerce for merchants and consumers alike. As with many young companies, it comes down to efficient execution. The management has a strong, proven track record of developing new technologies, bringing them to market, and generating value for the investors. The CEO has exited 5 other companies.\n\nWe should note that our forecasts largely reflect the typical growth inherent in new technology firms from early mover/early adopter stage to mass market appeal. Plus, the speed with which adoption in the online world occurs tends to be faster than most historical segments, further bolstering our investment thesis and projected growth rates. The variables in our forecasts tend to be the average fee percentage charged to merchants as well as revenue derived via license. It is too early in the maturation cycle to firmly estimate such revenue breakdowns or figures.\n\nTo simplify and streamline our initial forecasts, we have estimated $100M in business transacted at an average fee of 1.8% for Year 1 (Apr 2021-Mar 2022), reduced to 1.5% on $800M in transactions in FY23E and $2.5B in transactions for FY24E. While we believe additional revenue streams could be booked in FY23E, we view such contribution as a bonus at this time. However, we do project $2.5M in licensing revenue and other fees in FY24E. Based on this model, we project revenue of $1.8M in FY22E with a loss of $2.45M, or ($0.09) and revenue of $12M in FY23E with net profit of $650K, or $0.02. We preliminarily project $40M in revenue ($37.5M in transaction fees and $2.5M in licensing fees) for FY24E with net of $7.3M, or $0.22, and a net margin of 18.3%.\n\nGiven the game-changing technology and its resultant impact on the use of cryptocurrencies along with ecommerce efficiency and volume, we believe that RKFL could be afforded premium valuations as adoption occurs. Going forward, we recommend investors value the Company based on milestone events such as merchant signup as we view 2021 as a key infrastructure, proof-of-concept year, with major revenue growth in the cards in 2022 (fiscal 2023). Our 6-12-month target of $6.15 reflects a reasonable 4x our FY24 (CY23) sales estimate of $40M and roughly 28x our $0.22 EPS forecast. This target could prove to be conservative if adoption accelerates later this year or in early 2022.\n\nFinally, we believe that as a critical mass adoption among merchant occurs, the Company could emerge as a takeover candidate by a leading payment services or provider entity. RocketFuel\u2019s leadership has an enviable history of building and selling technology start-ups at key inflection points. While this event may not occur, it may have an occasional impact on valuation and should provide further confidence in management\u2019s capabilities.\n\n**INDUSTRY PRIMER: BLOCKCHAIN**\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nAccording to a recent report by Markets and Markets, the blockchain technology market is expected to reach the $39.7B mark in 2025, up from $3B in 2020.\n\nA blockchain, also known as a \u201cdistributed ledger technology,\u201d is a sequential, ever-growing, time-stamped set of records used to secure transactions across multiple devices that are grouped in blocks and maintained by disparate participants. Each block is interdependent, making alterations of records economically difficult if not outright impossible.\n\nTransactions in money, equities, bonds, titles, deeds, contracts, and virtually all other kinds of assets can be implemented and stored securely, privately, and from peer to peer, because trust is established by network consensus, cryptography, collaboration, and sophisticated code---without intermediaries. Given the opportunities associated with such a disruptive technology, many firms in varied industries are actively operating in the space to transact business, agreements and financial transactions more efficiently.\n\nCommercial and central banks across the world are now using blockchain technology for payment processing and issuing of their digital currencies. The technology enables cross-border payments that are less expensive and faster as compared to traditional systems. The remittance cost within the blockchain is 2% to 3% of the total amount as compared to other third parties as blockchain does not require third-party authentication.\u00a0Even governments are introducing CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currency) to replace cash and traditional fiat-currencies. Plus, they are putting social media behemoths such as Facebook and Google under scrutiny for their lack of privacy protection and data security.\n\nOne of the most popular applications of blockchain is cryptocurrency. Trading in cryptocurrency is relatively easy compared to other assets. You can begin trading just\u00a0by signing up for various wallets on the market. Furthermore, there are different types of wallet apps, each with its own advantages, such as\u00a0levels of security, accessibility, and more. The most popular and well-known wallet is Coinbase with 639,885 daily active users (DAUs). If Facebook\u2019s Libra initiative to its 2B users is successful, this figure will be dwarfed in short order.\n\nThe payments segment dominated the market in 2020 and accounted for more than 44.0% share of the global revenue. Blockchain technology improves payment system efficiency, minimizes operating costs, and offers transparency. These benefits provided by blockchain technology are increasing its use in payment solutions, thus, driving the segment growth. At the same time, blockchain reduces the need for middlemen in payment processing, which is also a major factor driving the segment growth.\n\nBitcoin (the largest cryptocurrency) is the most popular application of blockchain, but increasingly this innovative technology\u00a0can be used in various business and commercial purposes. The elimination of the middleman in various transactions and processes promises a much more efficient workflow using blockchain.\u00a0Additionally, increasing concerns about privacy and security make blockchain an ideal technological pipeline for modern processes.\n\nEnter the eCommerce application.\n\n**ROCKETFUEL: THE GAME-CHANGER**\n\nWhen validating a new market or technology, it is instructive to review history as it tends to repeat itself. Most major technology breakthroughs and disruptions had a few things in common:\n\n* A large, inefficient market, usually based on old technologies and processes, generating problems and unnecessary cost for all stakeholders.\n* A new technology allowing new companies to invent new solutions that address these problems.\n\nSome examples include improved internet technology which enabled Amazon to evolve our commerce habits from brick and mortar to digital and mobile technology innovations and evolutions that have led to Uber and Lyft transforming transportation.\u00a0 The payments industry is no different. Its architecture and operations are still based on a 40-year-old physical card with a chip and limited fraud prevention capabilities. In contrast, digital technologies such as blockchain and cryptocurrencies are prompting the replacement of the old architecture with a new efficient, lower cost approach. y changes the way payments are made.\n\nThere is a huge inefficient market (the payment market) causing problems for all stakeholders. There is a technology that has the potential to fix it. Enter RocketFuel Blockchain.\n\nRocketFuel is a new frictionless blockchain based payment solution for eCommerce merchants to accept payments in crypto or cash via bank transfer and receive payment and shipping information in one one-click transaction without the need for payment intermediaries. In anticipation of a major proliferation in crypto utilization for payments and business, large eCommerce and retail merchants now accept crypto as a payment method. In fact, over one-third of all small and medium-sized U.S. companies already accept Bitcoin as a B2B payment source.\n\nThe eCommerce space is estimated to be $3.5T, yet it represents less than 15% of total commerce. PayPal, a significant player in the online payments arena with over 350M users, allowed users to buy and sell crypto and just announced its \u201cCheckout for Crypto\u201d feature. This function, allows users to instantly convert their Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, or Bitcoin Cash to US dollars (with no additional transaction fees) that PayPal then uses to complete the transaction. In our view, this is a validation of the RocketFuel approach and will likely capture its share of this function. Still, since it lacks the 1-click convenience and appears to still be clunky and expensive relative to our forecast of the RocketFuel pricing, RocketFuel remains in the driver\u2019s seat.\n\nAs mentioned above, existing solutions are costly, impact conversion, not secure, leads to fraud, and will eventually go the way of the milkman. Merchants and consumers alike crave security, convenience, transparency, low cost and trust. \u00a0\n\n***The*** ***RocketFuel*** ***Approach***\n\nThe Company provides check-out and payment systems directly on the check-out page that securely automate and simplify the way online payment and shipping information is received by merchants from their customers. The check-out systems are designed to enhance customers\u2019 data protection, enabling consumers to pay for goods and services using cryptocurrencies or by direct transfers from their bank accounts without exposing spending credentials such as credit card data. At the same time, the check-out systems are designed to increase the speed, security and ease of use for both customers and merchants and include a merchant portal that provides detailed transactions and metrics about payments received by the merchant.\n\nThey also include a customer portal where shoppers are able to track their payments, configure payment defaults and connect with various cryptocurrency exchanges and banks to facilitate payment to merchants. Merchants are able to integrate a unique pop-up user interface that allows customers to pay directly from their ecommerce checkout page with no need to redirect to another website or web page.\n\nData is key and the merchant portal is updated instantly when a payment transaction is made on the merchant website. The merchant is notified of the transaction and can see the transaction details, including the customer that made the transaction, the transaction amount and the transaction items. This information is added to the merchant dashboard where various metrics are tracked and displayed to the merchant, including information about the various cryptocurrencies that are used for payments to that merchant and the funds received by the merchant from the different currencies.\n\nCustomers of merchants that use the RocketFuel payment solution are able to track their payments in their online portal. They are also able to track payments they made to all the merchants that are integrated with the RocketFuel payment technology within one consolidated user portal. They are able to connect to multiple exchanges including Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, Gemini and others to pay directly from them. They can also pay from any cryptocurrency wallet. Customers are able to connect with multiple bank accounts to pay from as well.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7The \u201csingle-click\u201d RocketFuel check-out solution is based on a streamlined check-out process for eCommerce purchases. The payment user interface is displayed as a stand-alone popup that allows the creation of new accounts as well as payment directly from crypto exchanges, crypto wallets, and bank accounts, with no redirects to browser tabs or pages. This can be integrated as a plugin on the merchant checkout page or as a browser extension. The plugin comes integrated with popular ecommerce platforms including WooCommerce, Shopify, Prestashop and others. The payment interface is designed for both web and mobile checkout experiences. Merchants are able to integrate the RocketFuel payment interface to their checkout page with software development kits (SDKs) that are available via the merchant portal. Application programming interfaces (APIs) are also available to the merchant for deeper integration into backend systems, ERP platforms, and other third-party platforms.\n\nCryptocurrencies are stored in different types of cryptocurrency wallets. These wallets can include mobile wallets, web wallets, desktop wallets, hardware wallets, and exchange wallets. Currently, it can be a difficult, confusing and multi-step process to use these wallets to make cryptocurrency payments. With RocketFuel\u2019s blockchain solution, cryptocurrency holders can use any of the above digital wallets to make payment for products or services to any RocketFuel merchant with 1, 2, or 3 steps.\n\nUsing the \u201csingle-click\u201d RocketFuel check-out technology and check-out button, consumers will no longer be re-directed to a third-party\u00a0 With the RocketFuel solution, eCommerce merchants will need no contact or other information exchange with the consumer in order to receive their payment or shipping details. Instead, they will have immediate visibility of payments from customers via the RocketFuel payment system, which may be integrated into merchants\u2019 fulfillment centers.\n\nLooking ahead, the technology will also be used for different scenarios, including paying for services, paying invoices, and other payment strategies. In addition, under a future version of the payment system, advertisements in which the entire check-out process is embedded will be able to be placed on third party websites and sales may be completely finalized there. Thus, the platform will enable eCommerce strategies that can include advertisements with a fully integrated check-out process. This prospective feature is unlike any other currently in use today and could eventually be a significant driver of revenue, once completed. Such advertisements will provide significant new sales channels to retailers that are simply not possible with legacy check-out solutions.\n\nIn addition to potential competition from PayPal, the primary competitor remains Bitpay, which is already well established as the leading crypto payment technology in the market, having been founded in 2011. Given that RocketFuel offers a better user experience for crypto payments, allows payment from dozens of other cryptocurrencies, and other wallets, and exchanges, RocketFuel\u2019s diversity is a major strength.\u00a0 RocketFuel also offers services that Bitpay currently does not, such as providing merchants immediate visibility of payment transactions, real time metrics of transactions and customers, easy integration to ecommerce checkout as well as deep integration to backend platforms. Furthermore, with an average of 72,000 transactions per month, it will not take significant merchant penetration for RocketFuel to surpass Bitpay, in our view.\n\n***Target Markets*** \n\nThe Company\u2019s initial target market is the travel industry and RockeFuel already has signed up two sizable customers: Sky Tours and Military Fares. It should be noted that worldwide sales of flight tickets sold online in 2019 was $540B and the 2 largest reservations systems generate more than $10B in yearly revenue, making this vertical a hot commodity. Management plans to target travel merchant and web platforms. Given the complexity of the intermediaries and reservation systems, high costs and notoriously delayed payments, the RocketFuel solution can simplify the payment process and customers no longer have to provide sensitive information. We believe other verticals such as online gambling, the procurement of gift cards, and high-ticket items could prove to be lucrative for the Company. As a result, we expect sales and marketing headcount to rise over the next 12-18 months, in conjunction with rapid deployment and implementation of existing and future solutions.\n\n**ROCKETFUEL BLOCKCHAIN LEADERSHIP TEAM**\n\n**Gert Funk, Chairman, Founder, Chief Product Officer**\n\nGert Funk has over 15 years as a payment service provider for international eCommerce merchants.

Plus, the speed with which adoption in the online world occurs tends to be faster than most historical segments, further bolstering our investment thesis and projected growth rates. The variables in our forecasts tend to be in the average fee percentage charged to merchants as well as revenue derived via license. It is too early in the maturation cycle to estimate such revenue breakdowns or figures.\n\nTo simplify and streamline our initial forecasts, we have estimated $100M in business transacted at an average fee of 1.8% for FY22E or Year 1 (Apr 2021-Mar 2022), reduced to 1.5% on $800M in transactions in FY23E and $2.5B in transactions for FY24E. While we believe additional revenue streams could be booked in FY23E, we view such contribution as a bonus at this time. However, we do project $2.5M in licensing revenue and other fees in FY24E. Based on this model, we project revenue of $1.8M in FY22E with a loss of $2.45M, or ($0.09) as management begins meaningful sales and marketing expenses to build awareness and execute merchant signups in key verticals such as the travel industry and online gambling.\u00a0\n\nIn FY23E, we forecast significant revenue growth with top line reaching the $12M mark. Total operating expenses are estimated to reach $8.25M with expanded sales and marketing expenses, along with R&amp;D, reflecting upgrades to the core functionality. Based on this model, net profit is slated to reach $650K, or $0.02, with a slight rise in shares outstanding to reflect a modest fundraise in conjunction with a prospective up-list to NASDAQ. We preliminarily project $40M in revenue ($37.5M in transaction fees and $2.5M in licensing fees) for FY24E with net of $7.3M, or $0.22, and a net margin of 18.3%.\n\nIt should be noted that while there are not material direct COGS, we have allocated some indirect expenses to arrive at a gross margin of around 72-73% for all years. We believe that this is conservative and may have to be adjusted higher, thereby raising profitability and our price target.\n\n**RISK FACTORS**\n\nIn our view, the Company\u2019s biggest risks are straightforward: the timing and magnitude of broad adoption of its core technology and applications by both merchants and consumers. Secondary risks include changes in the regulatory environment affecting utilization along with marketing effectiveness. Competitive risks include lower pricing, more effective sales/marketing, greater functionality and features. The aforementioned risks could come from larger competitors, existing firms, or new entrants. Still, these future concerns are consistent with firms of RocketFuel\u2019s size and early mover standing. Moreover, we believe that the Company\u2019s seasoned management team is prepared to overcome these hurdles and generate significant top-line growth, deployment and\u00a0 implementations.\n\nVolatility and liquidity are typical concerns for microcap stocks that trade on the over the counter (OTC) stock market. In addition to a recent funding access announcement regarding Triton Funds, management may seek to raise additional capital next year in conjunction with an up-list to NASDAQ, to fund corporate expansion and potential M&amp;A. An overriding financial benefit as a public company is the favorable access to and the availability of capital to fund product launches, consistent marketing campaigns and other initiatives. Since the proceeds of any future funding would be used in large part to advance major business development and sales, we believe that any dilutive effect from such a funding could be offset by related increases in market value.\n\n**VALUATION AND CONCLUSION**\n\nRKFL is an early mover as a global provider of one-click online payment options using Bitcoin and 40+ other cryptocurrencies. Moreover, RKFL is the\u00a0first cryptocurrency payment service to provide a seamless one-click checkout experience. The market is huge and growing at an enviable rate. According to Markets and Markets, the blockchain technology market is expected to reach the $39.7B mark in 2025, up from $3B in 2020.\n\nCurrent eCommerce methods are outdated, problematic, and costly, while the Company\u2019s platform is designed to improve the merchant and customer experience. Implementation should lead to lower merchant costs, potential recurring business and may foster customer loyalty.\u00a0\n\nManagement has a proven track record of developing new technologies, bringing them to market, and generating value for the investors.\u00a0The CEO has exited 5 other companies. Thus, we envision RKFL emerging as a takeover candidate. At present, our forecasts suggest sales will jump from $1.8M to $40M in 3 years, with meaningful EPS. Stocks tend to generate their greatest gains when the transition from early adoption to mass market appeal begins, which could begin in late 2021.\n\nGiven the game-changing technology and its resultant impact on the use of cryptocurrencies along with ecommerce efficiency and volume, we believe that RKFL could be afforded premium valuations as adoption occurs. Going forward, we recommend investors value the Company based on milestone events such as merchant signup as we view 2021 as a key infrastructure, proof-of-concept year, with major revenue growth in the cards in 2022 (fiscal 2023). Our 6-12-month target of $6.15 reflects a reasonable 4x our FY24 (CY23) sales estimate of $40M and roughly 28x our $0.22 EPS forecast. This target could prove to be conservative if adoption accelerates later this year or in early 2022.\n\nFinally, we believe that as a critical mass adoption among merchant occurs, the Company could emerge as a takeover candidate by a leading payment services or provider entity. RocketFuel\u2019s leadership has an enviable history of building and selling technology start-ups at key inflection points. While this event may not occur, it may have an occasional impact on valuation and should provide further confidence in management\u2019s capabilities.",

        "selftext": "Hi all, I have a call credit spread on $orcl at $75/$77.5 (tight spread, lesson learned) that expires 5/21. $orcl is really making a big run right now and I'm currently ITM on both my short and long. It's only 1 contract, so this won't break me, but I'd like to use it as a learning lesson.\n\nI sold the vertical for $0.41 credit and it will currently cost $1.91 debit to buy it back. With a $2.5 spread, my max loss is $250 - $41 = $209.\n\nOkay, so this is $orcl right now:\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/x/5xTdiiL9/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/5xTdiiL9/)\n\nMy thesis was that $orcl would continue in the channel for a bit when I sold this vertical. Looking back at the chart, honestly, I should have sold a bull put spread in March instead of a bear call spread, but my thinking at the time was, again, that $orcl would stay in the channel.\n\nSeeing this trade go south, I see these options:\n\n* **ASSUMPTION**: Stock will go down  \nLet theta work, assume that $orcle will not use the previous upper band as support and will instead fall back into the channel, leaving me OTM in the next few weeks. Worst case: take $209 loss\n* **ASSUMPTION**: Stock will find support ITM  \nBTC now at $1.91 debit for a realized loss of $150\n* **ASSUMPTION**: Stock will find support ITM  \nBTC the long leg, take the shares on the short leg, sell CC's (I don't want $orcl shares so I am not really very interested in this, just listing to be safe in case somebody believes it's the best option)\n\nAm I missing any outcomes/pivots here I should analyze? Also, what would you do and why?",

What are other Amazon's main businesses?\n\n**Indicators To Watch Out That Could Impact Amazon\u2019s Stock Price**\n\n* US Consumer Inflation. Higher inflation, less purchasing power from the large US customer base.\n* Producer Price by Industry: Computer and Electronic Manufacturing.\n* Producer Price Index by Commodity: Advertising Space and Time Sales: Internet Advertising Sales, Excluding Internet Advertising Sold by Print Publishers.\n* News on Antitrust and Monopoly.\n* ISM Non-Manufacturing Index, Amazon's: diluted earnings per share, price to book value and revenues.\n\n**News Sentiment**\n\n* As part of my analysis, I like to check recent news sentiment.\n* Tip Ranks shows this information via their free account.\n* According to them, **Amazon\u2019s news sentiment for the last 7 days is 84% bullish and 16 bearish.**\n\n**Social Media Sentiment**\n\n* As part of my analysis, I also like to check recent social media sentiment.\n* Stocktwits shows this information under their free account.\n* According to them, **their community is currently 82% bullish on Amazon.**\n\n**Fair Price / Valuations**\n\n* As part of my analysis, I also like to check valuation metrics from sell-side analysts.\n* Morningstar shows this under their premium account.\n* According to them, **Amazon stock is currently 19% undervalued and they see the fair value at USD4\u2019000 (today\u2019s price is at USD3\u2019374).**\n* This said, **if I look at sell-side 12-month forecasts from Yahoo Finance, the price could move between USD3\u2019048 and USD5\u2019200 (with an average of USD4\u2019009).**\n\n**Bonus Topic: Avoid anchoring bias when investing in Amazon Stock**\n\n**Anchoring Bias Explained**\n\nWe, humans, tend to rely too heavily on the first piece of information we see. When we are trying to make estimates or predictions, unconsciously, we use an initial value as a reference point; this is anchoring bias. It can give you an unrealistic perception of an investment that leads to poor financial outcomes; it is one of the most common cognitive biases.\n\nEvery day, loads of information bombard our lives; as a way of simplifying its processing, our brains tend to take mental shortcuts. These shortcuts help our brains save energy, be more efficient and reach decisions quickly. However, they can also be problematic, especially when deciding where to invest our money.\n\nSuppose we are looking for a gift and find something we like at a specific price; we'll likely compare all other potential gifts to the price of that initially seen. All other products will seem cheap or expensive compared and anchored to the initial present we found. Once the anchor's value exists, it defines all future estimates.\n\n**How anchoring bias affects your Amazon investment?**\n\nImagine yourself deciding whether to invest in a company. Once you see today's price, you become anchored. You subconsciously compare all new information to the starting point you created. Your anchor will be defined by that initial price rather than by the stock's intrinsic value. To determine the stock's fair value, ask yourself: \"if I didn't know the price, how much would I pay for an investment with those specific features, risks, and potential rewards?\"\n\nIf we are considering investing in Amazon, we would anchor ourselves to today's price (\\~USD3,374). On the contrary, if we owned Amazon stocks, we would likely anchor ourselves to our purchase price. With the forecasts presented above, we may anchor Amazon stock at today's price (USD3,374). We may also assign a relatively low likelihood of Amazon trading below analysts\u2019 low forecast estimate of USD3\u2019048 (-10% from today) or above analysts\u2019 high forecast estimate of USD5\u2019200 (+54% from today).\n\n**How to overcome the anchoring bias when investing in Amazon?**\n\nIn order to overcome the anchoring bias, I follow these four steps:\n\n1. I practice identifying anchoring biases, rationalizing my decisions, and most importantly, reflecting on the fair value of my investments.\n2. I thoroughly research potential investments and make sure sell-side analyst estimates are a good reference for me. I place my anchor where I see the value, not where others tell me to.\n3. I think about the volatility (swing in prices) of my investment and compare it to similar investments. For example, when thinking about Amazon, I ask myself: What percentage of my portfolio would I be willing to put in a stock that trades at USD3\u2019374 and could go down to USD3\u2019048 or up to USD5\u2019200?\n4. I make a rational assessment of the company as the basis for where to buy or sell Amazon. The company challenges and the long/short term nature of my investments are decisive for me.\n\n**MISCELLANEOUS**: If you liked the due diligence above, I am planning on posting similar pieces in the following [link](https://www.investories.co/).\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** The content on this note is being provided for information purposes only.

Along side this, it has the major competitor to SAP for larger size company ERP systems with Oracle Cloud.\nIt still doesn\u2019t have quite the economic moat that other companies do, and it\u2019s continued acquisitions means it has a lot of smaller product lines that are not major players in their respective markets.\n\nThe price seems reasonable (although has been increasing this quarter quite well, so not as much of a discount as it was). P/E is 18, and 30% of the EPS TTM has been paid out in dividends so has plenty of coverage.\n\nThe earnings have shown steady growth. The recent loss of Google as a client isn\u2019t great, but they have also been late to the SaaS model that provide more revenue dispersed over a period of time. I think the trend in earnings is starting to show the accumulation of SaaS product clients and could be poised to continue moving upward.",

The DeadEndGames stake is up sharply from the   end of the    third   quarter, when Birdshiter owned 8.4 million   DeadEndGames shares    worth   $85.6 million. This was disclosed in a   13-F filing for the end    of the   fourth quarter and an amended 13-F   for the end of the third    quarter.\n\nThe     DeadEndGames    purchase was likely orchestrated by Buffet, the CEO,   who   oversees the    company\u2019s huge equity portfolio. Birdshiter   requested and   received    confidentiality from the U.S. Securities and   Exchange   Commission for    the DeadEndGames stakes at the end of the   third quarter,   presumably    because it was continuing to build   positions in the stock in   the    fourth quarter and didn\u2019t want public   disclosure in mid-November  to     disrupt its accumulation of the   stock.\n\nIn a statement by the Oracle of Omyham :\n\n\"DFV        beat me to it because I don't know how to turn on a computer nor    use    an  App-Po phone.

        "selftext": "First of all, I would like to say that in this analysys I did not want to dwell too much into the technical aspects of the PLTR's software product or the financial performance of the company.  I am well aware that those are one of the most important fundamental elements when valuing a business and I did spend a lot of time on them while doing my research, before ultimately deciding to invest in the company. However I believe that most of the redditors on this forum , especially those that are already investors, already have at least basic understanding of PLTR's financial situation and the specifications of its software. In this thesis I will try to give my perspective about why I think PLTR is a low bottom company with significant potential for growth, based on more \"abstract\" and less known factors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nFirst of all, let's take a look at the commercial side of its business. Currently BP and Airbus contracts are responsible for 20 percent of the PLTR's revenue and some analyst think that such high-concentration is bad. However, they said the same think about PLTR's government work when the stock debuted. In short, they said that it is very worrying that PLTR generates such a high-percentage of its revenue from the U.S government and tried to convince investors to value PLTR not as a soft company, but as a defence contractor. I am glad that I did not listen to them at that time and bought the stock at 10 dollars, cuz my thinking was that if the U.S government values the PLTR's software so highly it is extremely likely that commercial businesess will do the same. Do you get where I am going? If Airbus and BP are paying the company more than 100 million dollars combined per year, then that means that PLTR's software is extremely efficient and if used right, could potentially safe customers hundreds of millions dollars of expenses or lost revenue. If you want more confirmation about how important the software could be for the business, have in mind that when partnering with the U.S Agency for Disease Control and Prevention, there are rumours that as early as January 2020 Palantir was able to build confidential models that showed the potential for a rapidly rising outbreak. Palantir then rushed in mid-February to recall staff from abroad and order them into a four-week quarantine. Now imagine if you knew about this as early as PLTR. March puts for the win.\n\nEven forgetting about the software and PLTR's growing revenue, let's take a look at some other factors that can't be measured by financial modelling. Currently PLTR is the only SaasS company in the world that is in talks to receive Impact Level 6 certification from the DoD. That means that PLTR will have access to classified information. Yeah, that is the kind of information that if you share with unauthorised personnel you go to prison for commiting treason against the state. Furthermore, the marine that participated in the operation of killing Bin Laden said in his book that PLTR soft. was instrumental in the sucess of the mission. To top it off , PLTR's lobbyist include figures like retired Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Terry Pau and ex- US State Secretary Condoleezza Rais and the new Director of National Intelligence in the Biden admin- Avril Haines is a former employee. Well, I think that we can say with great certainty that PLTR has become extremely important for the U.S government operations. If history has taught us anything, it is that if  the U.S government values something , it will not shy away from spending millions of taxpayers dollars to keep it afloat. But it as not only the U.S government. PLTR has won numerous contracts with government agencies of other countries like the British NHS and PLTR's head of operation in Israel- Hamutal Meridor, served as senior director of Verint, with deep ties to Unit 8200. Unit 8200  is an Israeli Intelligence Corps *unit* of the Israel Defense Forces responsible for collecting signal intelligence (SIGINT) and code decryption.\n\nIf you are still not sure about PLTR's importance maybe you would like to know more about who is behind the company. Peter Thiel is a cofounder and the current largest shareholder. Yeah, that is right-Peter fucking Thiel. This guy was a business associate with Elon Musk in Paypal, he was the first investor in Facebook and a mentor of Zuckerberg and is a close friend of Chamath. He also bankrupted Gawker, cuz they had the audacity to leak the news that he is homosexual. Many people believe that he is one of the most well-connected men in the world and it comes at no surprise that he is a member of The Bilderberg group ( conspiracy theorists believe that these guys control the world) . I forgot to mention that his nickname is King Midas, cuz everything that he touches turns to gold.\n\nPalantir's other cofounder and current Ceo- Alex Karp is also a pretty interesting guy to say the least. He is a juris doctor from Stanford University, and a doctorate in neoclassical social theory from Goethe-Universit\u00e4t, Frankfurt, Germany. He is also a regular participant in the Davos economic forum. Oh, he also actively practices Tai Chi and Quidong. Yes, this guy actually studied the blade, how could you not trust him?\n\nTo sum it up, I will use Alex Karp's own words: \u201cWe are going to deliver the world\u2019s best software with the world\u2019s most efficient way of delivering it. Investors will decide what that\u2019s worth to them. And I think you\u2019ll find in a number of years that there will be a consensus: Palantir is a truly special software company that is arguably the most important software company in the world.\u201d -Karp the day they went public\n\nPS: English is not my mother tongue and I wrote this piece in a rush, so please excuse me if there are any grammatical or spelling errors.",

Autodesk's Role\n\n[Engaging with Industry 4.0](https://preview.redd.it/kz4g5qfd3zq61.png?width=3840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e45fab6fc951bf329cd89d8beccad8fe7504bb89)\n\n# TL;DR\n\nMeaningful, sustainable, long-term employment.\n\nThe current administration and Federal Reserve are continuing to progress in setting the stage for long-term investments in the American economy. In combination with the USMCA trade deal of 2020, the US will see 250B in investments over 8 years for infrastructure refactoring. We take a look at how Autodesk is a core benefactor of the economic models that govern these investments. I expect Autodesk to triple in size by 2024.\n\n[Autodesk Revenues](https://preview.redd.it/aj4qbyf05zq61.png?width=1276&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfff18884011a16bded7ba20d46e3772fad4a6fe)\n\n# Purpose\n\nTo be frank, I was surprised by the hunger for knowledge and I really enjoyed debating some of the rather brazen people here. WSB has grown and in my view, our committed analysts tend to run head-to-head with Wall Street analysts. We have on-the-ground experience as laborers, customers, and digital-natives that they often filter out of a privileged ignorance.\n\nPart of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation.\n\n\\- Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even rob-the-hood? **(Square DD Complete)**\n\n\\- How do we compare social media incentives? **(Pinterest DD Complete)**\n\n\\- What really is customer service? **(GameStop DD Complete)**\n\n\\- Are we familiar with new international trades that increase Mexican-Texan manufacturing? **(Kansas City Southern Rail DD Complete)**\n\n**-** What are elements behind US lagging industrial sector? **(You are here)**\n\n\\- Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio? *(Cloud Compute DD in Progress)*\n\n\\- Do we understand the consequences of STEAM education (Science, technology, engineering, arts, mathematics)? *(Roblox DD in Progress)*\n\n\\- How knowledgable are we of fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?\n\nAt the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m sharing my writing. I\u2019m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.\n\n# The Employment Problem\n\n&gt;The **Fourth Industrial Revolution** (or **Industry 4.0**) is the ongoing automation of traditional manufacturing and industrial practices, using modern smart technology. Large-scale machine-to-machine communication (M2M) and the internet of things (IoT) are integrated for increased automation, improved communication and self-monitoring, and production of smart machines that can analyze and diagnose issues without the need for human intervention.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A Skill Gap Problem](https://preview.redd.it/sbi6dmoy6zq61.png?width=711&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1cad0f9dc367ce723290f7ae65f97f702812041d)\n\nUltimately, the US is doing a pretty good job at maintaining  its engineering and architecture sectors, but there has been a glaring issue with a skill-gap that effects certain regions more than others. This is largely due to the strained relationship between increase automation vs. difficulty of learning the new tools associated with automation. People get left behind, especially when employment is lost in one factory and a worker is left to join another manufacturer with different standards, machines, or tools. In a nutshell, the barrier to entry for sustainable employment in the industrial sector has gone up in almost every facet.\n\nTools like Autodesk sit at the heart of these kinds of problems, where being able to understand and utilize a tool like Autodesk will dramatically increase your ability to get hired. In the information age, skills associated with Autodesk are ultimately as valuable as learning how to code in software or knowing the value of legislation and finance in other white-collar sectors. Autodesk lags behind these competitive sectors because the nature of industry it exists in with high capital expenditures. \n\nThe problem is a bottleneck problem, and solving the bottleneck will produce a far leaner and more efficient pipeline for industrial productivity, employment, and societal satisfaction.\n\n*Processing img kvm8z2md8zq61...*\n\n# The Education Solution\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ly24pppuezq61.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ab25ce2945104acb0f3c4d3816cb713db1af238\n\nThe reality here is that the education sector is also a slow-mover where shortcuts carry heavy competitive consequences. Another big element in this process is that high-level skills are ultimately dependent on adoption and communication demands. We need adaptable engineers to be familiar with a fundamental skill set that speak similar \"languages\". Autodesk has generally positioned itself to be one of those tools in a similar way that organizations like Adobe has positioned itself.\n\nWhat I believe will happen is that the incentive of certifications and accelerated programs will increase dramatically as a way to boost lucrative employment and adoption of skills. These training programs will effectively become tickets initiate a good career.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mj3rk4a2gzq61.png?width=2528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bde08f5487ed3afdd3a760fc1b3d7a019eb89ca6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xib18z21hzq61.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bb74a3b31dda0b750b0cb19fdfc4f97a2a4515b\n\n# AutoDesk's Role\n\nAutoDesk targets the EAC sector (engineering, architecture, and construction), so it helps to think about AutoDesk as software that can handle large scale developments focusing on the nature of smaller designs like intricate screws or cars. There is a lot of work that must be completed, with a strong societal demand. This can range from multi-year developments of hospital building in rural areas, or the construction of off-shore windmill farms. This inevitably creates a powerful compounding effect with employment and Autodesk's subscription model and increasing mobile capacities.  \n\n\n\\- As employment increases, subscriptions begin to increase.\n\n\\- As subscription increases, projects of scale are adopted.\n\n\\- As projects of scale increase, employment increases.\n\n\\- As employment increases, the length of subscription increases.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vk4hin3cozq61.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b569a74582ac2699904727002ae3663f530a95c7\n\nThe following is a list of Autodesk's relationship with various opportunities in the near and longterm.\n\n\\- **LEED architecture certification in civil sectors with Autodesk's architecture platform, Revit.** \n\n&gt;**Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design** (**LEED**) is a green building certification program used worldwide.

If you missed getting bitcoin seven years ago, you wouldn't want to miss this.\n\nHere is my invite link: https://initiativeq.com/invite/Ye7onIZde5\n\nThis link will stop working once I\u2019m out of invites.

        "selftext": "This post will detail some speculation on why believe Bitcoin will soon break 60k and potentially move to 70k within the next month or two. I'm fairly confident the bull run for Bitcoin is not over yet and will continue into this year before we see a correction.\n\n\\-Current Price of BTC around time of this post is around 58k-\n\n**External Catalysts**\n\nThe past few weeks there have been an onslaught of positive news for BTC . To name a few major ones:\n\n\\- Paypal is now incorporating use and everyday people can exchange BTC and other cryptocurrency.\n\n\\- Square, Tesla, and several other companies have included it in their balance sheet. Microstrategy essentially embraced their whole mission around it. Overstock accepts BTC as payment.\n\n\\- Spending will be high with the stimulus package and other bills under Democrats. BTC can be seen as a hedge to the dollar\n\n\\- Visa and other credit cards have also started incorporating it.\n\n*More importantly, there are major catalysts that will be coming this April that will likely propel it forward more:*\n\n\\- BTC ETFs are already being submitted by major institutions like Fidelity. When the GOLD ETF was introduced, the value of gold went on bull run the year to follow.\n\n\\- Coinbase IPO will be happening in April if there are no more delays. This one is **major**! Just the event will get the talk of cryptocurrency spread and be the chatter of the month.\n\n\\- Literally today Chipotle is getting in on the fun too with their Burrito or Bitcoin event: [https://newsroom.chipotle.com/2021-03-30-Burritos-Or-Bitcoin-Chipotle-To-Give-Away-200k-In-Free-Burritos-And-Bitcoin-To-Celebrate-National-Burrito-Day](https://newsroom.chipotle.com/2021-03-30-Burritos-Or-Bitcoin-Chipotle-To-Give-Away-200k-In-Free-Burritos-And-Bitcoin-To-Celebrate-National-Burrito-Day)\n\n**Technical Analysis:**\n\nBTC this week reached almost 60k three times this week.\n\nKey levels of Resistance: 60k, 64.5k\n\nKey levels of Support: 53k, 51k\n\nSettling at 58k is very bullish at it means it is bouncing *above* the 9-day and 21-day moving averages. If it's able to hold this it should be able to get to around 62k. If it passes the mental wall there, it can easily surge to 70k before correcting. If it fails to support 55k then we could see a downside\n\n**Tickers that follow Bit Coin: $MARA, $RIOT, $CAN**\n\nI chose three tickers to focus on that will likely benefit from a rally. I know there are other ones like SOS, BTBT, FTFT but those are high risk from what I've seen having short reports written up on them. And when Bitcoin goes down, they go down hard. Let me know if there are any new tickers that follow Bitcoin too.\n\n**MARA**\n\n\\- Bitcoin mining company I've been following since it was 5$. Has strong support\n\n\\- Recent News: To Launch the First North American-Based Bitcoin Mining Pool.\n\n\\- Reached a 52week high over 50+ today\n\n**RIOT**\n\n\\- Same as MARA a crypto mining company I've followed since it was 10$. It's always been slightly ahead of MARA but it seems the gap is closing.\n\n\\- Recently reported GREAT earnings 300% surprise in EPS\n\n\\- Heavily shorted (20%) which may be why it has not been climbing as hard in following BTC, but will easily soar multiple levels if Bit rallies hard enough.\n\n\\- Reached over 70 last time BTC ran\n\n**CAN**\n\n\\- The only Chinese stock I singled out that could see a strong run correlated with Bitcoin if it were to run this month.\n\n\\- Canaan manufactures equipment used for mining Bitcoin. As the price rises, more and more companies are enticed to mine.\n\n\\- Reached around 40 last time BTC ran\n\n*Bearish Warning:*\n\n\\- In the past when Bitcoin has ran, there has always been a big correction afterwards. Invest at your own risk.\n\n\\- Offerings can happen if the price climbs too much",

        "selftext": "This is an excerpt from previous DD but i want to share so people have a chance to make their own choice and do their own research before this stock blows up...\n\nPaysafe (NYSE:PSFE). The merger is legally official, it's going to be a massive cash cow. You've got online gambling, sports betting, big casinos shifting online, privacy payment provider e-wallets, the main branch with its own payment cards accepted internationally and seamlessly, also allowing private crypto purchases, not to mention their probability of supporting the fledgling esports igaming industry. All in one package. It is going to be colossal. Paypal is having issues just keeping their shit together with simple crypto transactions, people are pissed, moving to better providers like Square (which is also a great growth stock btw). The iGaming(online gambling) industry is already in the hundred billions of dollars per annum and Paysafe is a major payment processor at the forefront with a long and trusted track record if any of you are familiar with Neteller and Skrill formerly Moneybookers etc. \n\nIf BFT - Foley's track record on the other hand is any example of success, they can prop it up massively. The best of both worlds as BFT is also bringing insurance and investment holding companies along with it for some icing on the cake. \n\nPaypal is weakening and they are falling behind in these markets, they are too vanilla and wont touch any of this and are too busy un-clusterf*cking their already KYC users frozen or blocked btc transactions, besides people want ease of use without borders and no bullshit verification processes. I had history over a decade ago working directly with the digital payment providers currently under Paysafe when online gambling was basically outlawed in North America not to mention taking client orders which we still did anyway on regulated soil (come at me FBI) Im in Canada we had authorities do walk throughs of our offices all the time. Digressing. With BFT hovering around $14-$17 which to be honest is a goddamn steal right now, once it transitions into PSFE I estimate it will hit $40+ within the first few months, with far reaching upside, smack in between 2 crazy global industries that are on fire rn: crypto and igaming.\n\nLittle ex employee insider information for you right there. \n\n Jk, as i said, its all public knowledge, but these payment providers are proverbial money printers and not the bad kind and with all the Casinos shifting their business online/covid/crypto/kids stealings mom's credit card betting on their favourite twitch streamers to win at CS:GO, Fortnite,half joking. I'd say most current online betting money is in sports and poker in the 18-40 age range, you get the odd rich Boomers who drop 40k a day on coin flips or how many injuries there will be in a game, sick shit like that, who bets 40k on a coin flip? The rest are grannies hitting slots.  \n\nThe US is also lifting a lot of sanctions Federally and by state IIRC, relating to online gambling; BFT/PSFE is practically a lock. I highly suggest to anyone pick up BFT stock asap or at very least get some early wet feet. I personally own a few hundred and plan to buy more.",

        "selftext": "Paysafe has finally just gone public with a new Board of Directors, much less debt, lots more cash, new M&amp;A plans and a new ticker: PSFE During yesterday's ticker change, there were several reports of people having no access to their accounts and/or suddenly being faced with an abrupt change in margin requirements from 25% to 100%. Many suggest this was intentional manipulation to give institutions cheaper shares. Regardless, this may have created a good buying opportunity for us too. For those interested, here's some comprehensive DD.\n\nPaysafe is a unique combination of fintech, iGaming, sports betting and banking all rolled into one stock. Whether you like him or not, this is essentially why NBC\u2019s Jim Cramer recently said, \u201cThere is something about Paysafe that may be the ultimate stock for this moment.\u201d (video link below) Market analyst Steve Grasso says, \u201cIt\u2019s the most excited I\u2019ve been about a stock in a long time.\u201d Grasso, by the way, has repeated called for it to triple ($45-50). So why is that?\n\nPaysafe offers a scalable electronic payment platform used by Draftkings, Roblox, Spotify, eToro, Fortnight, Coinbase, Amazon, Twitch, EA, 888, ApplePay, Youtube, Visa, Microsoft, Xbox, Amelco, William Hill, Ceasar's, Betfair, Pokerstars, PayLease, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, bet365, Lotto among many others.\n\nPaysafe is ranked No. 2 globally in the digital wallet space with presence in 120 countries and No. 4 globally in integrated merchant processing.\n\nImportantly, Paysafe is the No. 1 global leader in iGaming eCash network (currently 36% of revenue) with 10-15X growth projected. US iGaming continues to be legalized state by state, growing revenue by 234% in just the last year. \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is enabled for digital currency (a type that shall not be mentioned in these parts) without having to go through fiat. It recently partnered with Coinbase to expand options in US and it just launched PaysafeCash in US. (Now in 40 currencies and 30 global markets enabling easier cross border payments.)\n\nPerhaps most central to this recent merger is Bill Foley, Fidelity\u2019s Chairman of the Board and now the Chairman of Paysafe, who has a proven track record for generating exponential synergistic inorganic growth. For example, in just the last five years, he grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). He also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion (36.4X) and he says, \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d\n\nOf their expansion plans Foley says, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else.\u201d \u201cI have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody. That\u2019s why I got so excited about Paysafe Group Holdings Limited as its position in iGaming is really second to none.\u201d \u201cWhether it\u2019s a lottery or slot machines or sportsbetting opening in a state, it\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate. We\u2019re focusing on gaming, particularly sportsbetting, in the United States as it becomes legal and we\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting.\u201d\n\nAlong with Bill Foley, Paysafe's newly announced Board of Directors includes a former Morgan Stanley CEO, a former Chairman of the American Gaming Association and CEO of MGM Resorts International, a legal and regulatory expert in the multi-jurisdictional online and retail gambling industries, the CEO of Dun &amp; Bradstreet and CEO of Black Knight, two senior Managing Directors from Blackstone and two senior Managing Directors from CVC,\n\nBetween the new Board of Directors, Bill Foley\u2019s proven expertise in rapid M&amp;A growth and Paysafe\u2019s massive market share and diverse assets, including the world\u2019s second largest digital wallet, $362 million in free cash flow, 30-35% margins (21% CAGR), a projected $100-110 billion in transactional volume and $1.5 billion revenue, it is inevitable that institutional investors will, by necessity, include PSFE in their portfolios.\n\nPaysafe\u2019s industry leading risk management and international regulatory expertise gives them an edge in spaces where competitors have hesitated like iGaming, sportsbetting, alternative currency trading as well as offering essential banking and ecommerce services to the \"unbanked\" (1.7 billion globally). Paysafe has a global platform with integrated cloud technology (Snowflake) allowing for easier migration of eCash, integration of payment methods and expansion into global banking as a service. Paysafe is so diversified that they've identified a $58 trillion TAM.\n\nFurther, major investment funds know that fintechs are the future. Fund manager Cathie Wood says, \u201cFintechs are going to, we believe, gut banks.\u201d Similarly, Jackie Reses, board member of the SF Federal Reserve and fmr Head of Square Capital, calls for fintech \u201ctaking over and revolutionizing banking\u201d representing \u201ca wholesale transition\u201d of a $16 trillion market cap.\n\nAnalyst Michael Del Grosso recently initiated coverage saying, \"We believe PSFE represents a relatively scarce asset within the payments industry given its unique business strategy, geographical footprint, and focus on the iGaming industry. Our forecasts imply revenue growth at the high-end of management's guidance and we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming. PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States.\"\n\nInvestors should be aware that there is are post-merger lockup periods before insiders can sell their shares: PIPE: = 176 days. Private Equity = 86 days (roughly 6 and 3 months respectively accounting for trading days and weekends). Something to be aware of but there are several signals that these parties aren't in any rush to sell. Eli Nagler, a Senior Managing Director at Blackstone, recently said: \u201cToday is a significant milestone for Paysafe and a testament to the excellent work of their world-class management team over several years. We believe Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a public company.\u201d Regarding Blackstone and CVC, who now have four senior managing directors on Paysafe\u2019s Board, Foley said, \u201cThey rolled a significant amount of their investment which is a confidence builder. They didn\u2019t take all their money off the table\u2026 All of these things put together really created the confidence among the investor base to invest in the PIPE and then support the stock.\u201d Also, the PIPE investors are primarily insurance companies known for long term hold strategies and they are closely associated with Bill Foley. As Foley recently said, \u201cHaving a large PIPE basically validates the transaction.\u2026 The companies that I\u2019m affiliated with actually invested roughly a billion dollars in the PIPE and forward purchase agreements so Paysafe was always a really protected asset, besides the fact that it\u2019s a great asset.\u201d\n\nBill Foley says Paysafe may be his \u201cbest investment ever.\u201d He says, \u201cIt\u2019s a fortress. It\u2019s got a moat.\u201d \u201cWe have a proven strategy of winning as new global markets open. And most importantly, we have unrivaled regulatory risk and technical expertise.\u201d\n\nAs an aside, even though, \u201cRoughly 75% of online gambling operators use Paysafe for processing payments\u201d many in the US haven\u2019t yet heard of it yet. Partially because much of its presence is in back-end processing. Through its several new partnerships (Coinbase, Microsoft Rentmoola), Paysafe is just now rolling out its offerings in the U.S. In Europe, where it is more commonly used, Trustpilot rates Paysafe as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars) with over 20,000 reviews, and Skrill (owned by Paysafe) 4/5 stars \u201cgreat\u201d with over 16,000 reviews, while competitor PayPal is rated \"poor\" only 1/5 stars with over 16,000 reviews. Further, Paysafe was winner of the American Gambling Awards\u2019 \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and owns Openbucks, Neteller and Skrill, 2019 winner \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for best consumer take up and most innovative technology with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d Also, Paysafe won \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d 2021 MPE Award and the gaming industry SAGSE award for \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n\nTo give a sense of their pace and progress, these are some of Paysafe\u2019s recent announcements that were made before going public and have not been factored into the current valuation:\n\nDec. 15 \u2014 Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US\n\nDec. 21 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform\n\nDec. 23 \u2014 Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft\n\nJan 11 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Colorado\u2019s BetWildwood\n\nFeb 1 \u2014 Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership\n\nFeb 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services\n\nFeb 18 \u2014 Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world\u2019s largest esports company\n\nFeb 23 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency\n\nFeb 25 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Austria\u2019s A1 esports League\n\nMar 1 \u2014 Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash\n\nMar 12 \u2014 Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\n\nMar 15 \u2014 Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet\n\nMar 16 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments\n\nMar 25 -- Paysafe\u2019s Skrill expands digital currency offering to US with Coinbase\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFortunately for shareholders, even before Foley\u2019s value creation play book is put into action, Paysafe is currently undervalued compared to sector peers.\n\nSince market analyst Steve Grasso continues to his repeat his calls for a triple ($45-50), I've looked more closely at EV / EBITDA, EV / Revenue and EV / Free cash flow multiples of sector peers, including PayPal, Nuvei, Repay, Shift 4, Adyen, Square, Affirm, Stripe, Chime and a few others, using cross-referenced data from Nasdaq, WSJ, Morningstar, Macrotrends, Yahoo Finance. The conservative average of those three multiples puts Paysafe\u2019s post-merger pro forma share value at around $46.52:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price using the average multiples from the full list of sector peers:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore realistic share prices, after eliminating all outliers with very high multiples:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage :$46.52\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: Unlike Paysafe, nearly half of these publicly traded fintechs still do not report positive cash flow. Also, these multiples reflect a collective 27% pull back from recent highs so interest rate risks have been somewhat factored in.\n\nAlso, Paysafe's CFO noted that their conservative 11% growth projection is tied to the general fintech market at large. They have deliberately excluded both M&amp;A plans that are apparently already underway and US iGaming growth that may potentially grow 10x or more over the next 5 years. Further, the above comps include fintechs with slower or similar growth while still commanding much higher multiples. For example, Shift4 reported only 4% y-o-y growth and GPN's growth projection is on par with Paysafe's.",
