        "selftext": "**Everyone's done their own basic DD on performance and financial records, but few have spoken on the competition or board members of Cloudflare. Here is my DD on these two areas:**\n\n**Competition -**  \nCloudflare's main competition comes from 'Amazon CloudFront' and 'Microsoft Azure CDN'. This competition comes across as hostile with both competitors being large blue-chip firms utilizing conglomerate integration.  \n[Cloudflare's Customers](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/case-studies/)  \n***Amazon CloudFront -***  \nFounded in 2006 Amazon's CloudFront is known for its simplicity and range of settings however, compared to Cloudflare it is more expensive and has limited features lacking quality. Total revenue for Amazon CloudFront (2019) $178 Million compared to Cloudflare's total revenue (2019) of $287 Million.  \n[Amazon CloudFront's Customers](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/customers/)  \n***Microsoft Azure CDN -***   \nFounded in 1975 Microsoft's Azure CDN is known for its speed. Its drawbacks, however, are greater: confusing payment plans, limited features, poor interface, and overpriced. Total revenue for Microsoft Azure CDN (2019) $125 Million, Cloudflare more than doubled this.  \n[Microsoft Azure CDN's Customers](https://www.featuredcustomers.com/vendor/microsoft-azure-cdn/customers)\n\n**Board of Directors -**   \nYour investment in Cloudflare needs confidence. The board of directors is those representing you, the shareholders.  \n**Matthew Prince CEO -**   \n46 years old born in '74, this smart chap has a degree in English and Computer Science, Trinity College, Dublin. Graduate and scholar, Harvard Business School. Professor of Technology Law, John Marshall School. Recipient of Dubliner prize for entrepreneurship.  \n**Thomas Seifert CFO -**   \n56 years old, the estimated net worth of this man is at least\\* $4.91 Million as of June 2017. His first role as Chief Financial Officer was at AMD in Oct 2009 - Sep 2012. Over these 3 years, AMD's stock price recovered from the 08 crash trading sideways during his stay. In September 2012 he announced his resignation, news hitting the papers AMD's stock plummeted after his success as a financial planner. Since then he has been on the board of Brightstar Corp., Symantec, and remains on the board of IPG Photonics.  \n**John Graham-Cumming CTO -**  \nEducated at the Uni of Oxford he was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy degree in Computer Science. He's the author of two books and a software engineer. Best known for the successful petition to the Government of the United Kingdom asking for an apology for its persecution of Alan Turing.\n\nMore Info + Pictures:  \n[Forbes' DD (Sep 2019)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2019/09/12/what-investors-need-to-know-about-the-cloudflare-net-ipo/#58b671d23d8e)  \n[Article on AMD stock drop (CNET)](https://www.cnet.com/news/amd-cfo-thomas-seifert-resigns-sending-stock-down-8-percent/)  \n[Article on AMD stock Plunge](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-advancedmicrodevices-cfo/amd-loses-respected-cfo-shares-plunge-idUSBRE88G1DC20120917)  \n[AMD Chart during Thomas' position](https://ibb.co/QQjM7xt)  \n[Cloudflare Case Studies](https://www.cloudflare.com/casestudies/?utm_expid=.Uw0M9SKJQfiAvhDFmwKjwQ.1&amp;utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cloudflare.com%2F)\n\nThis is my first post on Reddit, it took me a while to gather this information I hope it's of some help? I'll be posting full DD's in the future. Apologies if this came across as shallow.  \n**TL;DR**  \nCloudflare outcompetes the poor competition on price and functionality but, may need partners or acquirers to justify its optimistic forecast evaluation.

        "selftext": "TL;DR - $WORK is not fully priced in; there is still time to jump in for earnings. 7/17 55c &amp; 8/21 44c\n\nUnless you've been living under the bed your girlfriends boyfriend bangs her on, you know that there's a pandemic on and a lot of need for remote working. Putting aside the actual issues and benefits of it, most of companies that have provided these services have been posting some pretty impressive earnings reports and guidance. $ZM in particular, as you know, has posted very impressive gains this past week, but the cloud and virtual workspace companies in general have done pretty damn great. But we're nearing the end of earnings and there isn't all that much left, but there is something for today, and that's $WORK.\n\nSlack ($WORK) is a subscription-based distributor of virtual workspace technology. There are groups, rooms, support for 3rd party apps so you can send shit back and forth between colleagues, etc. Obviously they're set to do pretty great right? And if it's been on your radar recently, you'll know that it's up pretty significantly even since last week. In fact, today it reached the highest its been since IPO; and it's set to keep going up. &gt;But wait, you say, ain't it priced in? And for the more intelligent among you, you might point out that $MSFT offers basically the same thing through Microsoft Teams, which unlike $WORK's product comes free for businesses which also have a deal with Microsoft. So why, you may ask, would any business shell out for what they already get for free? Doesn't that hurt $WORK both for earnings and for future guidance?\n\nHere's the thing though. Teams is like using hand cream and your hand to crank it; Slack is like Astroglide and a top-tier pocket pussy to do the same. One gets the job done, and one gets the job better and makes you cum. I want you guys to cum with me. You get what you pay for in the virtual workspace market, and Slack has the name recognition and quality to be something companies are willing to pay a subscription for. It's just better overall. Of course what's one autist's take on it, when you could ask what the top dogs are doing. IBM is rolling this shit out to it's entire 350k member workforce; IBM isn't some millennial orgy startup, it's a real company with real weight. There's also some behind the scene \u201crumors\u201d that Amazon is gonna be adopting it the coming months for a large section of their operations. YES AMAZON. ONCE THAT NEWS BREAKS IT WILL MOOOOON.\u00a0 Ya know, that one. If that isn't a resounding endorsement of Slack's quality, idk what you're waiting for, because God himself isn't about to come down telling you Heaven's adopting Slack anytime soon.\n\nWe can see that the stock price is way above the VWAP line indicating a bullish run coming. Further more using the different SMAS I have implemented in my studies it has auto made the upward trend to create those purple lines all pointing upwards. Furthermore we can see it broke the $40 resistance ah and can see the continuation during premarket . Also we can see that the rsi is rising above the 60 line indicating a bullish run as well. The run it has had has no gaps below to fill so we will continue to rise and incorporating UOA showing big money is predicting a big rise after earnings as well. If any of you fucking idiots don\u2019t know TA then it means stonk go up dumbasses.\n\nI think it's pretty clear that $WORK has some mid-term growth in it, and if you're expecting Wave 2: Electric Boogaloo that's even more assured. I'm pretty bullish, so I've grabbed 7/17 55c. It's pretty far OTM, I know, but they're cheap and with what I'm expecting on earnings, they're gonna blow past some of the deep algorithmic TA that I've been seeing putting WORK at $42 a share, and I think it's going to stay up there and keep going. So why bother with the IV crush of short-dated options? Slack's becoming to the virtual office game what Zoom is to the video-conferencing game, and I fully expect AH is gonna be like watching the 1969 moon mission from a front-row seat.\nIBM - \u00a0https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/slack-stock-price-ibm-biggest-account-global-employees-messaging-platform-2020-2-1028890304\n\nMy stake -\u00a0https://imgur.com/a/LtfjJnz\n\nFurther reinforcement its compatible with AMZN -\u00a0https://imgur.com/a/QdHbxs5\n\nTA -\u00a0https://imgur.com/a/eREtF4V\n\nDisclaimer: None of the above is financial advice.

Here comes my next play with a similar amount of heads up, ORCL. Lets see if we can beat the previous gains (CLDR is going to be tough to beat honestly that was huge).   \n\n\n**TL;DR** \\- Oracle(ORCL) has earning coming up on 6/17 (After Market). ORCL is yet another! cloud company that also provides database software solutions. As all of our previous plays they are benefiting even more from the current situation. Further multiplied by multiple companies looking to invest in more cloud infrastructure, remote engineers and so forth. Huge potential to rocket up in the next few weeks. Plays - **ORCL $55c &amp; $60c 7/17**\n\n**What is Oracle?**  \nOracle is in the big leagues with the likes of Microsoft, leading the cloud and database space. Oracle Corporation provides products and services that address enterprise information technology environments worldwide including cloud, software as a service and data base tech. They are investing heavily and maybe even leading the autonomous database through AI which is growing more critical every day to to the exponential amount of data needed to be stored, analyzed and used.   \n\n\n**Financials** \n\n* The company generated around $40 billion in revenue and over $10 billion in earnings every quarter (27% profit margin) for the past year. It's also met or beaten analyst expectations for EPS over the same time period. \n* Oracle's revenue stability comes from its cloud computing and licensing services, which account for over 70% of company revenue.  \n* Strong and stable dividends.\n* Short Term and Long Term Liabilities - ORCL short term assets of $33.4b exceed short term liabilities of $15.74b significantly.   \n\n\n**Play**\n\nORCL $55c &amp; $60c 7/17\n\nI am also thinking about getting in on the same positions for 6/19.\n\n**What are your thoughts?**",

        "selftext": "Alright, ZM is on that retard running exercise program again. Looks like scalpers looking for a quick buck before earnings. This stock looks like it\u2019s exactly higher lows for the last 3 months but it\u2019s all driven by hype and disillusionment.\n\nHere\u2019s what I know. Most people aren\u2019t a paid subscriber. For example, from the info I\u2019ve collected so far, 18/20 school districts that I had contact with are not on a paid plan. In fact, three of the local school districts in my area in the East Bay held fiscal meetings on Zoom, but they would tell everyone in the beginning of the meeting that there is a 45 minute limit and the meeting will close - that we would have to wait for another think to rejoin. That\u2019s basically another way of saying, we ain\u2019t paying for this shit. We on that free free. \n\nOn the topic of education, tutoring is a big income stream for ZM. A lot of tutors hosting 1-2 hour lessons actually pay for the professional option. My son and daughter\u2019s tutors can host Zoom lessons for 2 hours without interruption for that reason. But just recently, both tutors are saying that they are preferring to meet in person now so save the cost of doing Zoom lessons. They said most tutors are returning in person lessons and that it should be safe to do so. So, there you have it. Another sector that is breaking off from Zoom. \n\nFor tech businesses which I\u2019m directly associated with, some do pay for zoom and others don\u2019t. Had a 2.5 hour conference with a partnering tech company a week ago and they had us rejoin with a new link twice. You would think a tech company would just buy a professional account if not better to host meetings, but no. For my company, I know that our plan is set to be canceled by end of June since people are heading back to work. \n\nMoreover, let\u2019s take a look at ZM vs competitors. \nSkype fucked it up. Their one big moment and they busted too early. Google Meets/Hangouts has an incredibly simple UI and extended functions that work with Google\u2019s numerous applications. Cisco webex, Google Hangouts, Jitsi Meet, Slack, Microsoft Teams to name a few are all doing virtually the same things. Nothing novel about ZM other than the frequent security issues. \n\nCompany is currently valued at 57B where 3 months ago it was worth around 10B. The shelter in place was great, but it\u2019s about time ZM gets a big correction. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this dips below $100 by July.",

        "selftext": "##AVCT\n\nThis is a neat one, very excited to find this and post about it here.\n\nThere's very little discussion out there on AVCT.  They've never been mentioned on /r/SPACs before today.  They've flown completely under the radar as far as I can tell.  It seems like the stock IPO sort of tanked because the Holding company went to market without the merger being completely finished.  They rebranded to AVCT, but they didn't really have a core product ready yet.  People seem to have assumed the stock was vaporware and sold off.  They had a couple quarters of 0 revenue, stock tanked, since then everyone seems to have forgotten about them, even though it has only been 4 months.\n\nBut, then they merged with Computex, which is their core product --  Computex is now being renamed to AVCT.  So, Computex is the company to read up on if you want to know what AVCT is worth.  From what I can tell, Computex seems... totally legit.\n\nThey are actively posting jobs:\n\nhttps://computex.net/careers/\n\n&gt;US-TX-Houston\n\n&gt;Posted Date 2 days ago(6/1/2020 8:20 AM)\n\n&gt;**Job Title Principal Engineer, Infrastructure Services (Microsoft Technologies)**\n\n&gt;An established 30+ year-old yet growing $150M+ technology company, with 200 employees in multiple states, is seeking a senior level Data Center Engineer in our Network Operations Center (NOC) in Houston, TX. This is a Tier 3 level resource with specialized knowledge and experience in Microsoft Technologies, Azure, Office 365, Messaging Technologies, Virtualization and Core Infrastructure Services. This position will work closely with our Principal Engineers and Infrastructure Team to maintain, update and introduce new functionality to the existing environment. This person will also assist in supporting the Windows server environment and other server/storage infrastructure projects will be assigned as needed.   At Computex, our Guiding Principles are simple, but critical to maintaining our incredible culture and our daily endeavor for excellence in everything we do. o Delight our Customers o Develop a Fun &amp; Creative Workplace o Provide Value to our Shareholders   The ideal candidate also believes in these core guiding principles and mission.\n\n&gt;Job ID 2020-1072\n\nI work in IT, and everything in the job posting is perfectly valid.  Computex seems to be a nice, $150M+ business with like 200 employees.\n\nThey have employees listed on LinkedIn, around 190 profiles, which aligns with all of their claims in the job post.  The employee profiles are solid and they have real experience.\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/jon-burbach-14ba923/ - Worked for IBM for 11 years..\n\nExecutive team seems solid.  Their first earnings are about to come out on 6/14.\n\nIt's a real cloud company, by all indications around 80% undervalued, **for $0.09 a warrant.**\n\nThe ONLY way a SPAC should ever trade this low is if it's some sort of scam / malfeasance / etc. -- that doesn't seem to be the case here. There is every indication that this stock will return to $10 fairly quickly after a couple quarters of earnings, and that warrants will return to around $1.\n\n## Built-in 5-10 bagger on Warrants.",

        "selftext": "TLDR: The numbers don't add up + 2021 guidance is complete garbage + standing firm on my previous prediction that ZM will correct 30% by mid June.\n\nReport Revenue: 328M\n\nReports that 88% of revenue comes from Enterprises, meaning 288M came from these businesses.\n\nReported Enterprise Users: 275,000\n\nThe Math:\n\nCost of enterprise plan - $19.99 per host/per month\n\nGiven that the 275,000 enterprise customers consist of companies with 10+ employees, lets say the ratio of host to employees is 1 host per 10 employees. Seems fair?\n\n Now lets assume that the average # of employees for these 275,000 accounts is 100 employees. Seems fair right? JPM Data for 2014 finds that 99% of American businesses are small businesses and 88% of that employs less than 20 employees. Based on my approximation of 100 employees on average, that would be 10 hosts per company or $199.90 per company/per month.\n\nSo, 275,000 accounts x $199.90 x 3 months for the quarter = \\~165M\n\n165M is pretty far off from 288M, no? Maybe they rounded up or something.\n\nBut wait, they also said 768 customers contribute 100K for a 12-month trailing revenue. So... that's an additional 76.8M in revenue. \n\n2 problems here: 1) they said these customers are not adjusted into the revenue since these are trailing (or extrapolated) numbers assuming they don't cancel their subscription. \n\n2) Even if we add the 76.8M, we are still short $46.2M.\n\nIf you're still following the math at this point, congrats!\n\nHere's the second part of this analysis and it has to do with it's outrageous guidance. Their CFO said they are estimating \"conservatively\" in their guidance, but they somehow suddenly doubled their forward 2021 guidance from $900M to $1.8B. Yes, you didn't read that wrong. $1.8B is their estimated 2021 \"conservative\" guidance. Does this remind you of any company that did this type of magic math when their underlying value increased by 200% in the month? Tilray anyone?\n\nWe are at a point where the peak pandemic is over and people can care less about getting infected at this point because their UI claims are running dry and they have to go back to work soon. Conveniently, Google hangouts/meets + Cisco Webex + Microsoft Teams among others are competing for their lion's share of this space. Here's the difference: They all have integrated technology that can link applications and they are also free. Teams and Google are also significantly safer from a security standpoint. Tech companies are also mainly using Teams. That leaves that 275,000 customers most likely small businesses with much fewer than 100 average employees. \n\nThe point is that Zoom will NEVER be able to hit 1.8B in revenue unless COVID-19 kills 1 million people overnight, Kim Jong Jun says he will be hosting his deathbed message on Zoom, a 5-year shelter in place is effective immediately, and they start pimping Zoom employees as escorts. \n\nThey are down in AH btw. Even after all that.",

There has been an acceleration toward this reality but it's still early in the overall development cycle.\n\nPhysical and monetary assets being virtualized has recently been accelerated in importance and this will have positive effects, across time, on businesses that focus on securing those assets in its time spent delivering on multiple ultra-high-speed networks across the world. Computing is getting cheaper and easier to distribute in rather extreme ways and the execution of these ideas is happening right now.\n\nThe need for secure video, transactions, VR, and user experiences will be dramatically shot up and this is evident across many exciting technologies like Apple VR, Google Gaming, Square Banking, Facebook Shops with VR shopping, Microsoft software automations, and government developments.\n\nInfrastructure that support these interactive ecosystems will be growing at incredible rates. NET is one of the best positioned companies to pioneer this market.\n\n[The networking market](https://mordorintelligence.com/images_db/RD_Images/1556091324027_Picture2.png)\n\n# # My motivation\n\nCloudFlare is releasing and bolstering support for streaming, video, and communications as a security-first cloud provider in the following week.

Competitive advantages\n\nThe reason Snapchat did not gain any traction did not gain any traction outside of the US was because Facebook provided a fundamentally faster service across WhatsApp and Instagram.

        "selftext": "Hello Team, \n\nThis is my first post ever on reddit, so let\u2019s hope it sparks a good conversation. I\u2019m not talking as if I know it all, but I just wanted to write a good catchy title to grab your attention. \n\nI\u2019m a 23 year old guy, who\u2019s been investing in the markets for 3 years. I had 15k of OSAP debt which I paid off ever since I started working at a bank in downtown. I\u2019ve been living at home with my parents so I don\u2019t have to worry about rent. The rest of my money, excluding expenses on food/gas/entertainment has been put straight into my TFSA, because I believe that as I go further on in life my tax bracket will go up. So financially, it makes more sense to max out my TFSA contributions now and worry about RRSP contributions later. \n\nI saved up several grand each year and was waiting for a market drop to buy into companies. I eventually saved 25k before the stock market dropped so I bought 2 chunks of RY.TO stock, which is Royal Bank of Canada. The bought the first chunk at $91 and the 2nd chunk at $84. So I own $25,000 of RBC at $87.5/share. I\u2019m getting dividend income of over $200 a quarter, which should drip me 2 shares a quarter. \n\nIssue: Should I enable a DRIP to take advantage of compound interest so I can retire early? Or should I add my dividend income to my usual TFSA contributions and start to diversify and buy companies like Nike, JNJ &amp; MSFT? \n\nPeople have become rich by just buying more and more shares of the Canadian banks, so if I know it\u2019s worked in the past, why differ from that success? I know there\u2019s historical bias here, but realistically, the banks make money in the good and bad economic times.\n\nThanks for your time :)",

        "selftext": "Hello fellow autists, this is my first DD, so please be as rude as possible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nDKNG shares will print, currently at ATH, so it\u2019s hard to predict the near future for options play. Maybe LEAPS if you can afford it (I know you can't, I had to put it in to not be banned).\n\nThere are many catalysts upcoming for Draftkings that are talked about in length, but here is another angle to support the general confidence.\n\nI am a developer, which means I have no clue what I am talking about, but if you are still interested, read on.\n\nOne aspect when it comes to potential growth is that new markets are opening up by legalizing and who might gain the biggest share of those markets. Fanduel and Draftkings are the leading Fantasy Sports Apps and I wanted to understand their technical foundation to judge how they might do.\n\n1. App\n2. Hiring\n3. Tech Stack\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**App**\n\nI'll compare and explain numbers for the Android app.\n\nAs you can see, both apps have a very good rating, but as always the details matter. There is a system called NPS ([Net Promoter Score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter)) that assumes people will be a promoter or detractor or neutral, so we look at 5 and 1-star ratings and ignore the middle as they are deemed neutral.\n\n[DKNG Ratings Android](https://preview.redd.it/yy62p7j3wb251.png?width=656&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f26f9479b173f87cc42b75012505ad5da3e06cd)\n\n[FD Ratings Android](https://preview.redd.it/xg9mjbj3wb251.png?width=644&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a2a02d240d3e0779d02a9457cda9b4769077ceb)\n\nDK has 68k ratings, while FD has 37k, so DK is \\~54% bigger in this segment.\n\nDK has \\~63000 x 5, \\~5000 x 1 which results in 92% promoters and 8% detractors (4.7 stars).\n\nFD has \\~32500 x 5, \\~4500 x 1 which results in 88% promoters and 12% detractors (4.5 stars).\n\nSo while both apps are rated highly, FD actually has 50% more detractors. Why bother?\n\nThere is an important business metric called [Customer Lifetime Value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_lifetime_value#Methodology), where churn rate plays a huge part. And I'll assume for simplicity that detractors represent churn rate. I know this is not necessarily true and there are more factors to it, but just to show how the above numbers are relevant.\n\nSince most of you can't even read, I'll spare you the advanced math, but here is a simple version\n\n(monthly revenue \\* margin) / churn rate, if for both companies monthly revenue per customer (100$) and margin (25%) would be the same\n\n100$ \\* 25% / 8% = 312$ CLT\n\n100$ \\* 25% / 12% = 208$ CLT\n\nso churn rate directly translates to Customer Lifetime Value.\n\nSince DK is already 54% bigger and has way less churn, it will easily outgrow FD further. And fixing broken things in tech is hard, so it is highly unlikely that FD will turn these numbers around.\n\n**Hiring**\n\nI went to both companies open jobs sites ([DKNG](https://careers.draftkings.com/search) [FD](https://www.fanduel.com/open-positions)) and compared how many, what kind of and where the jobs are offered.\n\nThe food chain looks sth like this VP &gt; Principal &gt; Lead &gt; Senior &gt; Junior &gt; Autist, so the higher, the more valuable.\n\nFD 13 jobs, 7 senior (VP, Lead, Senior, Senior, Senior, Senior, Senior)\n\nDK 14 jobs, 11 senior (Principal, Principal, Principal, Lead, Lead, Lead, Senior, Senior, Senior, Senior, Senior)\n\nSo the share of senior positions is a lot higher for DK and the roles themselves are also way higher on average.\n\nThose 14 jobs include 4 Site Reliability positions, which means DK is preparing for a huge influx of users and they continue to put a lot of effort into keeping their stellar user experience.\n\nAnother important factor is where they hire. Think of talent pool, networking options, conferences, and prestige as relevant aspects.\n\nFD hires in Edinburgh (9 out of 13), 2 in NYC, 1 LA, and 1 in Beaverton Oregon.\n\nDK hires in Boston (9) and Dublin (5).\n\nSo Boston has the MIT and a few other universities for talent pool and then Dublin. I know you retards don't even know where Dublin is, but let me tell you that it's a fucking tech hub. Google, Facebook, Microsoft, AWS, and a shit ton more in a rather small city.\n\n**Tech Stack**\n\nI was reading through all the open positions to get a feeling for their tech stack. I was mainly looking for red flags because the tech stack itself does not really mean anything, it's the people who use it after all. Here are the things I felt worth mentioning.\n\nFD uses AWS with container orchestration, so maybe Kubernetes which is pretty modern technology. Their Frontend uses Typescript and GraphQL which is a plus point in my book.\n\nDK uses AWS as well and mentioned Terraform which I rate highly.\n\nNo red flags, but also rather vague, cannot really draw any conclusions from that aspect imo.\n\nTo summarize, DK seems to have a better app, looks way better on the hiring and both probably use solid tech stacks.\n\nAgain, this is only one small aspect but I wanted to give back after having read about DKNG here a few weeks ago, so we can all make some tendies. I am long since DEAC and planning to hold til retirement (pls don't ban).",

        "selftext": "First, I want to say I know most of us, even the professionals have no idea what is going on, ever.\n\nSecond, nearly every news article and blog to me is consistently wrong. But what really pisses me off is the follow up news articles, postings, etc have a bogus explanation why something happened. The information that should of been presented prior if it were a true future analysis. There is no benefit figuring out a short term explanation for increase or decrease in a stock after the fact when the stock market is a future fight.\n\nFinally, I am no better than anyone else, but I get gut feeling on some stocks that just stand out based of their trend and my intuition. I haven't got cocky and gone all out on any of these, but I have strong feelings. For example:\n\no 2016 I invested $200 dollars into AMD (60 Shares) which is worth \\~$3200 today. I was looking through various businesses and saw AMD significantly lower than Intel at the time. It was like 2 dollars a share! I was certain it would have substantial growth, maybe dumb luck, maybe intuition. I won't lie, I have no idea when to sell and rarely do. They still appear to be doing so well and will have a significant hand in AI, future of gaming and other technologies. \n\no 2020 At the bottom of Tesla's stock in March trading about \\~350 a share, I knew that would quickly rebound as the future is now, the clear path to transportation is self driving just as significant as all revolutionary technologies. For me, when I retire in 30-40 years I see myself in a self driving RV, with virtual reality capabilities. So, I held off on Tesla at this time because I listed to people full of shit thinking the economy was going to crash and Tesla would be worth less than 250 a share. \n\no Currently, I've invested in a couple commercial airliners, because look at those margins. Analyzing how long it takes airlines to recover, I say full recovery in 2-3 years. I eyeballed Boeing hard, many articles cautioning 'too big to fail' what a load of garbage. They are critical to national transportation. I was going to put down $1,000 on them at about $120 per share. They are up to $173 per share today, and I believe this is only the beginning. \n\no Also, Ford is a lot like the airlines, I have watch this stock sadly die away for four years, and I don't think it will be gone for good. It was \\~9 a share prior to COVID, and went sub $5. I bought a little then and I think they could get to $7 maybe even 8$ before continued their downward trend. \n\nI deviated with my own holdings, but I want this to be about inaccurate articles saying we are going into a recession, specific companies are the next Apple/Amazon that usually go down. Seriously, look up old news articles on companies are overwhelmingly wrong. \n\nIf you are curious of my holdings: ALK, F, SBUX, WEN, MSFT, TSLA, CSCO, SFM, NVIDIA, KR, AMD, CANN\n\nIn the past 4 years, I have 50% gain. Whatever you do, don't buy CANN, I knew this was a dumb move, but i had a little greed in me when I did it.",

        "selftext": "My genuine thoughts on this. \n\nBefore I start, the stock market and economy are not correlated. The stock market is more of a speculative forecast of the future and since the major drop, investors are quite hopeful and sentimental positive on the future. \n\nFATMNG - Facebook, Amazon, Tesla, Microsoft, Netflix and Google. \n\n**1-** Now with the global protests for BLM, this can be looked at as a perfect condition for COVID-19 spreading, which can become observed within the next 2 to 3 weeks. \n\n**2-** The stock market has been held by FATMNG, looking at the S&amp;P holdings, most of the companies are in loss, and just these major companies are in profit, resulting in S&amp;P stock rising. At any point these shares are dropped/sold, the result can be catastrophic. \n\n**3-** Many companies have introduced new shares to the market. This has raised much-needed money for operations, but diluted stakeholders. Effecting their dividend yield and voting power. Shareholders are not happy with Air Canada 35million new share introduction for example. Also with introducing new shares, trade volume increases, increasing speculative price. \n\n**4-** FATMANG has performed stock buybacks, to raise its prices during the crash, now with extremely accelerated recovery, FATMANG can capitalise on their gains and sell their shares. Resulting point No. 2\n\n**5-** The economy is starting to open up, and speculative investors might see unprotected recovery. This is because the public is now spending less and saving more, this is harmful to the economy. This might decrease speculative investors sentiment and exit the market.  \n\n**6-** Supply shortages resulting in revenue drop. Big manufacturing companies stock is on the rise due to speculative investments. But with the current COVID spread (possible to be extended by Point No. 1), the manufacturing line could be slowed down, reducing revenue and investors sentiment. \n\nThese are just my thoughts, I personally would have the mentioned to happen.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 8th, 2020.\n\n# **Look for the S&amp;P 500 to turn positive for the year with a boost from the Fed in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/05/look-for-the-sp-500-to-turn-positive-for-the-year-with-a-boost-from-the-fed-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to reassure markets next week the central bank will do whatever it takes to help the economy heal. That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting is the big event for markets in the coming week. There are a few economic reports, including inflation data, the consumer price index Wednesday and producer prices Thursday. Weekly jobless claims will be important Thursday to see if there\u2019s a drop in continuing clams, after May\u2019s employment report showed a surprising record gain of 2.5 million jobs.\n*****\n&gt; The reopening trade was in full swing in the past week, especially Friday when stocks surged on the jobs report, which was expected to show a loss of 8.3 million jobs. The Nasdaq broke above its record high set on Feb. 19, and the S&amp;P 500 was just 1.1% away from turning positive for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Even before the jobs report, investors were loading up on financials, industrials, transports and small caps, which were up more than 8% for the week and 18.4% in the past month. S&amp;P financials were 12.1% higher on the week, S&amp;P industrials were up 10.5, and the NYSE airline index jumped more than 35.4.%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think next week is dominated by the reopening and it will be for another month,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. \u201cWith cyclicals outperforming, small [caps] outperforming, credit spreads coming in and then the bond yields going up, everybody \u2014 all facets of the financial markets \u2014 are sort of suggesting the same outcome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 3,193, a gain of 4.9%, and now traders are watching to see if it can scale the psychological 3,200 level. The Dow closed Friday at 27,110, up 6.8% for the week, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.4%, at 9,814 after reaching an intraday record high of 9,845 Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts say the market will likely look past the protests that broke out in cities across the U.S. after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Four policemen were charged with murder in his death. Looters joined the protests, some of which turned violent, but they quieted down towards the end of the week.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher for a third week in a row, but a change this past week has been the abrupt lurch higher in Treasury yields. The 10-year rose to a high of 0.95% Friday, a quarter-point move in just three sessions. The move was already underway but got a lift Wednesday when ADP jobs data was not nearly as bad as expected. Yields ripped even higher after the May employment report showed the unemployment rate actually fell to 13.3%, instead of climbing to 20%, as expected by economists.\n*****\n&gt; Bond strategists said the Treasury market was now acknowledging the potential for a recovery, but not in the exuberant way the stock market has been. Since March 23, the S&amp;P 500 has risen more than 45%, but it took the 10-year Treasury until this week to get back the yield level it was at when stocks bottomed.\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen said he believes a new bull market has been launched, but there could be pullbacks and some headwinds for the market coming up.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhen GDP is minus 30%, other issues don\u2019t matter. There\u2019s just one issue. But as the economy reopens again, the trade battles will matter again, presidential politics will matter again,\u201d said Paulsen, adding the budget deficit could also matter. \u201cI think we\u2019ll get removed from a sole focus. That isn\u2019t quite there but I think it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed begins its two-day meeting Tuesday, and will release its statement Wednesday afternoon, followed by a video briefing by Powell.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhey would the Fed want to disrupt this with anything?\u201d Paulsen said. \u201cThey\u2019re still going to support the economy. They\u2019re going to stay away from negative rates or yield curve management. They\u2019re not going to do anything to scare the markets. They might certainly reassure people that they are still ready to provide support.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America, said the Fed may clarify where it stands on some of the extraordinary moves it has taken since it cut rates to zero. The Fed has been supporting the markets with asset purchases and multiple programs for commercial paper, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds, for example.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe think right now they\u2019re just trying to get this Main Street lending program to work. The question is are they going to do more things around what they do in terms of forward guidance and next steps of macro easing,\u201d Harris said.\n*****\n&gt; There has been speculation that the Fed would do some type of so-called yield curve control, a program to keep interest rates capped at certain levels. \u201cI think it\u2019s too early for that,\u201d said Harris. He said the Fed would be guaranteeing low rates for a long period of time if it does yield curve control.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYield curve control is basically open-ended quantitative easing,\u201d he said. The Fed is currently buying Treasurys but if it wanted to stop yields from rising too much as the economy improves, it could make targeted purchases.\n*****\n&gt; Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said it\u2019s possible the Fed could announce the yield curve control. \u201cWe\u2019ve said they could implement yield curve control out to three years,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my mind that matches the length of the horizon of the economic projections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Powell has said the economy needs more fiscal help, and he could reiterate those comments Wednesday. President Donald Trump on Friday said he backs more stimulus. So far, the Democrats have put out a marker with their wish list for further spending, but there have been no negotiations.\n*****\n&gt; There was concern the strong jobs report could make it harder to get buy in for another big spending package. But some economists say the recovery needs a boost and states need funding to fill the holes in their budgets from coronavirus-related spending and a lack of tax receipts.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7klaXQm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PKTBzT2.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/a5JkAB6.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/M2x4Qoq.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qtJYfXN.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bjiJWjV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UAi19KJ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GQm4ruO.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uV1U7FN.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/wm2XJND.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yarkiMO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hFblu2G.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Stocks Outpacing Analyst Price Targets\n\n&gt; This morning's jobs report shocked the financial world -- most notably the economists whose job it is to provide estimates. The consensus estimate among economists for May nonfarm payrolls was projecting a loss of more than 7 million jobs. The actual number that was reported did not just show a smaller than expected job loss, but it actually showed a gain in jobs of more than 2.5 million.\n\n&gt; We're seeing a similar situation play out in the equity analyst community. With the S&amp;P 500 now up 40%+ since its low less than three months ago, the average stock in the index is now trading above its consensus analyst price target that looks 12 months out. Analysts have simply not been able to catch up to the rapid rise we've seen for equity prices.\n\n&gt; It's extremely rare to see share prices move above consensus analyst price targets. We don't have the historical daily data on this, but anecdotally we can't remember a time when the spread has been this wide. As shown below, at the end of 2019 when the S&amp;P finished a massive rally, equity prices were 5.5% below the consensus price target. That was seen as a very tight spread prior to what we're seeing now. At the lows in March, the average share price had dropped all the way to $92.50 compared to an average consensus price target of $143.20. That projected a gain of 54.9% at the time!\n\n&gt; Since March 23rd, the average share price has risen from $92.50 up to $138.40, while the average analyst price target has fallen from $143.20 to $136. Current price targets no longer project a gain for the average S&amp;P 500 stock, but rather a 1.7% drop.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/avgpricetarget.png))**\n\n&gt; # Nasdaq's Historical Run\n\n&gt; At its highs earlier this morning, the Nasdaq Composite was within 2% of its record high from earlier in the year. Besides the steep V-shape of the Nasdaq's pattern over the last four months, the other aspect of the chart that stands out is just how steep the 50-day moving average is trending lately.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-50DMAa.png))**\n\n&gt; To illustrate just how steep the Nasdaq's 50-DMA has become, the chart below shows the daily percentage change of the 50-day going back to 1971. Currently, the Nasdaq 50-DMA is rising at an average of over 0.5% per day. That's an incredible slope and a level that has been exceeded only a handful of times in the Nasdaq's 50-year history.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-Composite1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Big Gains From Smaller Tech\n\n&gt; It's still difficult to fathom the moves in the US equity market over the last four months. The fact that the Nasdaq and more specifically the Technology sector aren't far from record highs is definitely something no one was expecting two months ago. There's an old market saying that equities take the stairs up and the elevator down, but in the latest market cycle, the elevator up was almost as fast as the way down!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Nasdaq.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Technology-Sector.png))**\n\n&gt; If you've been following the markets, all you've likely heard up until recently is that large-cap tech, and more specifically, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Facebook (FB), are single-handedly driving the market higher. The reality is not nearly as clear-cut. Given their market caps, the \"Big 5\" (as they're often referred to) have done a lot of heavy lifting, but in terms of performance, they're hardly the only game in town.\n\n&gt; The table below lists Technology sector stocks in the Russell 3000 with market caps of more than $1 billion that are outperforming all of the 'big 5' tech stocks on a YTD basis. Actually, since Amazon is doing so well relative to the rest of the \"big 5\" these are all stocks that are outperforming Amazon. If we looked for stocks that were doing better than the average return of the \"big 5\" the list would be a lot, lot longer (+16.4%).\n\n&gt; Looking through the list of names below, the two top-performing names are Zscaler (ZS) and Twilio (TWLO), which have both more than doubled. Behind these two, DocuSign (DOCU) and Sprout Social (SPT) are both knocking on the door of triple-digits. All 28 of the names listed have market caps of $1 billion, but the average market cap is just over $21 billion, while Nvidia (NVDA) is the largest company on the list with a market cap of $216 billion. For the most part, these aren't names that have been driving the indices, but anyone holding these stocks in their portfolio probably doesn't care!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Tech-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Best 50-Day Rally Ever\n\n&gt; In many ways, what we\u2019ve seen so far in 2020 has been both record-breaking and devastating. From the S&amp;P 500 Index peak on February 19 to the bear market lows March 23, stocks lost 33.9%. Now, 50 trading days later, stocks have gained 39.6%, for the largest 50-day rally since the S&amp;P 500 moved to 500 stocks in 1957.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere are no rollercoasters that can replicate what stocks have done so far in 2020,\u201d exclaimed LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHere\u2019s the catch though: Big 50-day rallies in the past have taken place near the start of new bull markets, and the returns going out a year were quite bullish.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 39.6% gain in 50 days was the greatest 50-day rally ever, besting the previous best in October 1982. What\u2019s important to note here is that many of these rallies took place coming off major market lows, and delivered quite strong returns going out 6 to 12 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/best-fifty-days.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Although we have near-term worries given this historic run, as some sentiment indicators such as put/call ratios are showing some froth, from a bigger picture perspective, this strong 50-day rally offers a reason to think stock prices may be even higher this time next year.\n\n*****\n\n# 2020 In Charts\n\n&gt; 2020 is only five months old, but in many ways it is one of the most historic years we\u2019ve ever seen. \u201c2020 went from moving along nicely, to seeing the worst recession in a generation and the fastest bear market ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cNow stocks are in the midst of one of the best bull runs ever, even though the economy remains extremely weak, thanks to record stimulus and hopes over a vaccine.\u201d\n&gt; \nTo best sum it all up, here are 10 charts that tell the picture of 2020 so far.\n\n&gt; 1.) The 2010s were the first decade in history to go all 10 years without a recession, which of course ended just months into the new decade, as the economy stopped. Stocks gained 13.5% on an annual basis last decade, surprisingly, only the third-best decade over the past four.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 2.) This is an election year, and the S&amp;P 500 Index hasn\u2019t been lower when a President is up for reelection since FDR in 1940. Although this seemed nearly impossible at the March lows, it is looking like this incredible streak could have a chance in 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 3.) One of the first signs something could go wrong in 2020 was stocks fell in January. Historically, this has meant potential trouble for the final 11 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 4.) As fears over COVID-19 gripped the world, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its fastest bear market ever, in only 19 days. To put this in perspective, this was the fastest bear market in the 124-year history of the Dow.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 5.) Mark Twain said \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes\u201d. Looking at history, every 50 years there has been a terrible pandemic and stocks fell more than 30%. We don\u2019t know if the ultimate lows are in this time, but so far, history is rhyming.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 6.) More than 20 million people in the US lost their jobs in April, while the unemployment rate soared to near 15%, the highest since the Great Depression. Record drops in manufacturing, industrial production, retail sales, and consumer spending have all taken place in the past two months as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 7.) A recession is here, ending the streak of 128 months in a row without one. What is unique about the previous expansion was nominal gross domestic product (GDP) grew only 50%, about the average growth seen during the previous expansions, but this expansion was nearly twice as long as the average expansion (10 years versus 5 years).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 8.) The bounce off of the March 23 S&amp;P 500 lows has been historic in many ways. In fact, it was one of the best 20-day rallies ever, with previous best rallies seeing strong returns 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 9.) As scary as it was on the way down, stocks have come roaring back, gaining more than 35% from the March 23 lows. This would classify as the greatest bear market bounce ever, which opens the question: is this more than a bear market bounce and instead the start of a new bull market?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 10.) The number of COVID-19 tests in the US nearly doubled in May versus what was seen in April. Additionally, fewer and fewer tests are coming back positive. Testing is one of the key ways we will beat this and this is a step in the right direction. We\u2019ve also seen new monthly lows in people on ventilators, in the ICU, and in hospitals.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Hard to believe, but there are still 7 months left in 2020. It hasn\u2019t been easy for any of us, and we continue to keep everyone impacted by this pandemic in mind, but we continue to see the glass as half full. The dual benefit of record monetary and fiscal policy should help create a bridge to help those most impacted, while the economy can slowly come back online later this year.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending June 5th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1HAZbHiMUI))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 6.7.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n*(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)*\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$ADBE** \n&gt; * **$UNFI** \n&gt; * **$CHWY** \n&gt; * **$TIF** \n&gt; * **$LULU** \n&gt; * **$COUP** \n&gt; * **$SFIX** \n&gt; * **$LOVE** \n&gt; * **$NEPT** \n&gt; * **$GHM** \n&gt; * **$REVG** \n&gt; * **$GME** \n&gt; * **$HDS** \n&gt; * **$FIVE** \n&gt; * **$SIG** \n&gt; * **$CASY** \n&gt; * **$CVGW** \n&gt; * **$AMC** \n&gt; * **$FCEL** \n&gt; * **$QTNT** \n&gt; * **$PLCE** \n&gt; * **$CHS** \n&gt; * **$THO** \n&gt; * **$GCO** \n&gt; * **$BF.B** \n&gt; * **$LMNR** \n&gt; * **$WSG** \n&gt; * **$PRTY** \n&gt; * **$GES** \n&gt; * **$BBCP** \n&gt; * **$CONN** \n&gt; * **$HEXO** \n&gt; * **$PHR** \n&gt; * **$PVH** \n&gt; * **$RRGB** \n&gt; * **$PLAY** \n&gt; * **$TNP** \n&gt; * **$JW.A** \n&gt; * **$SB** \n&gt; * **$GSM** \n&gt; * **$SRT**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/bgPdMCr.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.8.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/d2EW1kr.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uxSiJJr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.9.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3SIjcG7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cRBrPlt.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.10.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DaheXAm.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9mcHxTl.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.11.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/i8SNjWM.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9xcBZPK.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.12.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Inc. $392.90\n&gt; **Adobe Inc.

        "selftext": "My genuine thoughts on this.\n\nBefore I start, the stock market and economy are not correlated. The stock market is more of a speculative forecast of the future and since the major drop, investors are quite hopeful and sentimental positive on the future.\n\nFATMNG - Facebook, Amazon, Tesla, Microsoft, Netflix and Google.\n\n**1-** Now with the global protests for BLM, this can be looked at as a perfect condition for COVID-19 spreading, which can become observed within the next 2 to 3 weeks.\n\n**2-** The stock market has been held by FATMNG, looking at the S&amp;P holdings, most of the companies are in loss, and just these major companies are in profit, resulting in S&amp;P stock rising. At any point these shares are dropped/sold, the result can be catastrophic.\n\n**3-** Many companies have introduced new shares to the market. This has raised much-needed money for operations, but diluted stakeholders. Effecting their dividend yield and voting power. Shareholders are not happy with Air Canada 35million new share introduction for example. Also with introducing new shares, trade volume increases, increasing speculative price.\n\n**4-** FATMNG has performed stock buybacks, to raise its prices during the crash, now with extremely accelerated recovery, FATMNG can capitalise on their gains and sell their shares. Resulting point No. 2\n\n**5-** The economy is starting to open up, and speculative investors might see unprotected recovery. This is because the public is now spending less and saving more, this is harmful to the economy. This might decrease speculative investors sentiment and exit the market.\n\n**6-** Supply shortages resulting in revenue drop. Big manufacturing companies stock is on the rise due to speculative investments. But with the current COVID spread (possible to be extended by Point No. 1), the manufacturing line could be slowed down, reducing revenue and investors sentiment.\n\nThese are just my thoughts, I personally would have the mentioned to happen. If you think otherwise, please comment below.",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 8th, 2020.\n\n# **Look for the S&amp;P 500 to turn positive for the year with a boost from the Fed in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/05/look-for-the-sp-500-to-turn-positive-for-the-year-with-a-boost-from-the-fed-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to reassure markets next week the central bank will do whatever it takes to help the economy heal. That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting is the big event for markets in the coming week. There are a few economic reports, including inflation data, the consumer price index Wednesday and producer prices Thursday. Weekly jobless claims will be important Thursday to see if there\u2019s a drop in continuing clams, after May\u2019s employment report showed a surprising record gain of 2.5 million jobs.\n*****\n&gt; The reopening trade was in full swing in the past week, especially Friday when stocks surged on the jobs report, which was expected to show a loss of 8.3 million jobs. The Nasdaq broke above its record high set on Feb. 19, and the S&amp;P 500 was just 1.1% away from turning positive for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Even before the jobs report, investors were loading up on financials, industrials, transports and small caps, which were up more than 8% for the week and 18.4% in the past month. S&amp;P financials were 12.1% higher on the week, S&amp;P industrials were up 10.5, and the NYSE airline index jumped more than 35.4.%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think next week is dominated by the reopening and it will be for another month,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. \u201cWith cyclicals outperforming, small [caps] outperforming, credit spreads coming in and then the bond yields going up, everybody \u2014 all facets of the financial markets \u2014 are sort of suggesting the same outcome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 3,193, a gain of 4.9%, and now traders are watching to see if it can scale the psychological 3,200 level. The Dow closed Friday at 27,110, up 6.8% for the week, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.4%, at 9,814 after reaching an intraday record high of 9,845 Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts say the market will likely look past the protests that broke out in cities across the U.S. after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Four policemen were charged with murder in his death. Looters joined the protests, some of which turned violent, but they quieted down towards the end of the week.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher for a third week in a row, but a change this past week has been the abrupt lurch higher in Treasury yields. The 10-year rose to a high of 0.95% Friday, a quarter-point move in just three sessions. The move was already underway but got a lift Wednesday when ADP jobs data was not nearly as bad as expected. Yields ripped even higher after the May employment report showed the unemployment rate actually fell to 13.3%, instead of climbing to 20%, as expected by economists.\n*****\n&gt; Bond strategists said the Treasury market was now acknowledging the potential for a recovery, but not in the exuberant way the stock market has been. Since March 23, the S&amp;P 500 has risen more than 45%, but it took the 10-year Treasury until this week to get back the yield level it was at when stocks bottomed.\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen said he believes a new bull market has been launched, but there could be pullbacks and some headwinds for the market coming up.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhen GDP is minus 30%, other issues don\u2019t matter. There\u2019s just one issue. But as the economy reopens again, the trade battles will matter again, presidential politics will matter again,\u201d said Paulsen, adding the budget deficit could also matter. \u201cI think we\u2019ll get removed from a sole focus. That isn\u2019t quite there but I think it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed begins its two-day meeting Tuesday, and will release its statement Wednesday afternoon, followed by a video briefing by Powell.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhey would the Fed want to disrupt this with anything?\u201d Paulsen said. \u201cThey\u2019re still going to support the economy. They\u2019re going to stay away from negative rates or yield curve management. They\u2019re not going to do anything to scare the markets. They might certainly reassure people that they are still ready to provide support.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America, said the Fed may clarify where it stands on some of the extraordinary moves it has taken since it cut rates to zero. The Fed has been supporting the markets with asset purchases and multiple programs for commercial paper, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds, for example.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe think right now they\u2019re just trying to get this Main Street lending program to work. The question is are they going to do more things around what they do in terms of forward guidance and next steps of macro easing,\u201d Harris said.\n*****\n&gt; There has been speculation that the Fed would do some type of so-called yield curve control, a program to keep interest rates capped at certain levels. \u201cI think it\u2019s too early for that,\u201d said Harris. He said the Fed would be guaranteeing low rates for a long period of time if it does yield curve control.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYield curve control is basically open-ended quantitative easing,\u201d he said. The Fed is currently buying Treasurys but if it wanted to stop yields from rising too much as the economy improves, it could make targeted purchases.\n*****\n&gt; Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said it\u2019s possible the Fed could announce the yield curve control. \u201cWe\u2019ve said they could implement yield curve control out to three years,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my mind that matches the length of the horizon of the economic projections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Powell has said the economy needs more fiscal help, and he could reiterate those comments Wednesday. President Donald Trump on Friday said he backs more stimulus. So far, the Democrats have put out a marker with their wish list for further spending, but there have been no negotiations.\n*****\n&gt; There was concern the strong jobs report could make it harder to get buy in for another big spending package. But some economists say the recovery needs a boost and states need funding to fill the holes in their budgets from coronavirus-related spending and a lack of tax receipts.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7klaXQm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PKTBzT2.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/a5JkAB6.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/M2x4Qoq.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qtJYfXN.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bjiJWjV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UAi19KJ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GQm4ruO.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uV1U7FN.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/wm2XJND.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yarkiMO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hFblu2G.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Stocks Outpacing Analyst Price Targets\n\n&gt; This morning's jobs report shocked the financial world -- most notably the economists whose job it is to provide estimates. The consensus estimate among economists for May nonfarm payrolls was projecting a loss of more than 7 million jobs. The actual number that was reported did not just show a smaller than expected job loss, but it actually showed a gain in jobs of more than 2.5 million.\n\n&gt; We're seeing a similar situation play out in the equity analyst community. With the S&amp;P 500 now up 40%+ since its low less than three months ago, the average stock in the index is now trading above its consensus analyst price target that looks 12 months out. Analysts have simply not been able to catch up to the rapid rise we've seen for equity prices.\n\n&gt; It's extremely rare to see share prices move above consensus analyst price targets. We don't have the historical daily data on this, but anecdotally we can't remember a time when the spread has been this wide. As shown below, at the end of 2019 when the S&amp;P finished a massive rally, equity prices were 5.5% below the consensus price target. That was seen as a very tight spread prior to what we're seeing now. At the lows in March, the average share price had dropped all the way to $92.50 compared to an average consensus price target of $143.20. That projected a gain of 54.9% at the time!\n\n&gt; Since March 23rd, the average share price has risen from $92.50 up to $138.40, while the average analyst price target has fallen from $143.20 to $136. Current price targets no longer project a gain for the average S&amp;P 500 stock, but rather a 1.7% drop.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/avgpricetarget.png))**\n\n&gt; # Nasdaq's Historical Run\n\n&gt; At its highs earlier this morning, the Nasdaq Composite was within 2% of its record high from earlier in the year. Besides the steep V-shape of the Nasdaq's pattern over the last four months, the other aspect of the chart that stands out is just how steep the 50-day moving average is trending lately.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-50DMAa.png))**\n\n&gt; To illustrate just how steep the Nasdaq's 50-DMA has become, the chart below shows the daily percentage change of the 50-day going back to 1971. Currently, the Nasdaq 50-DMA is rising at an average of over 0.5% per day. That's an incredible slope and a level that has been exceeded only a handful of times in the Nasdaq's 50-year history.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-Composite1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Big Gains From Smaller Tech\n\n&gt; It's still difficult to fathom the moves in the US equity market over the last four months. The fact that the Nasdaq and more specifically the Technology sector aren't far from record highs is definitely something no one was expecting two months ago. There's an old market saying that equities take the stairs up and the elevator down, but in the latest market cycle, the elevator up was almost as fast as the way down!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Nasdaq.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Technology-Sector.png))**\n\n&gt; If you've been following the markets, all you've likely heard up until recently is that large-cap tech, and more specifically, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Facebook (FB), are single-handedly driving the market higher. The reality is not nearly as clear-cut. Given their market caps, the \"Big 5\" (as they're often referred to) have done a lot of heavy lifting, but in terms of performance, they're hardly the only game in town.\n\n&gt; The table below lists Technology sector stocks in the Russell 3000 with market caps of more than $1 billion that are outperforming all of the 'big 5' tech stocks on a YTD basis. Actually, since Amazon is doing so well relative to the rest of the \"big 5\" these are all stocks that are outperforming Amazon. If we looked for stocks that were doing better than the average return of the \"big 5\" the list would be a lot, lot longer (+16.4%).\n\n&gt; Looking through the list of names below, the two top-performing names are Zscaler (ZS) and Twilio (TWLO), which have both more than doubled. Behind these two, DocuSign (DOCU) and Sprout Social (SPT) are both knocking on the door of triple-digits. All 28 of the names listed have market caps of $1 billion, but the average market cap is just over $21 billion, while Nvidia (NVDA) is the largest company on the list with a market cap of $216 billion. For the most part, these aren't names that have been driving the indices, but anyone holding these stocks in their portfolio probably doesn't care!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Tech-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Best 50-Day Rally Ever\n\n&gt; In many ways, what we\u2019ve seen so far in 2020 has been both record-breaking and devastating. From the S&amp;P 500 Index peak on February 19 to the bear market lows March 23, stocks lost 33.9%. Now, 50 trading days later, stocks have gained 39.6%, for the largest 50-day rally since the S&amp;P 500 moved to 500 stocks in 1957.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere are no rollercoasters that can replicate what stocks have done so far in 2020,\u201d exclaimed LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHere\u2019s the catch though: Big 50-day rallies in the past have taken place near the start of new bull markets, and the returns going out a year were quite bullish.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 39.6% gain in 50 days was the greatest 50-day rally ever, besting the previous best in October 1982. What\u2019s important to note here is that many of these rallies took place coming off major market lows, and delivered quite strong returns going out 6 to 12 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/best-fifty-days.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Although we have near-term worries given this historic run, as some sentiment indicators such as put/call ratios are showing some froth, from a bigger picture perspective, this strong 50-day rally offers a reason to think stock prices may be even higher this time next year.\n\n*****\n\n# 2020 In Charts\n\n&gt; 2020 is only five months old, but in many ways it is one of the most historic years we\u2019ve ever seen. \u201c2020 went from moving along nicely, to seeing the worst recession in a generation and the fastest bear market ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cNow stocks are in the midst of one of the best bull runs ever, even though the economy remains extremely weak, thanks to record stimulus and hopes over a vaccine.\u201d\n&gt; \nTo best sum it all up, here are 10 charts that tell the picture of 2020 so far.\n\n&gt; 1.) The 2010s were the first decade in history to go all 10 years without a recession, which of course ended just months into the new decade, as the economy stopped. Stocks gained 13.5% on an annual basis last decade, surprisingly, only the third-best decade over the past four.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 2.) This is an election year, and the S&amp;P 500 Index hasn\u2019t been lower when a President is up for reelection since FDR in 1940. Although this seemed nearly impossible at the March lows, it is looking like this incredible streak could have a chance in 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 3.) One of the first signs something could go wrong in 2020 was stocks fell in January. Historically, this has meant potential trouble for the final 11 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 4.) As fears over COVID-19 gripped the world, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its fastest bear market ever, in only 19 days. To put this in perspective, this was the fastest bear market in the 124-year history of the Dow.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 5.) Mark Twain said \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes\u201d. Looking at history, every 50 years there has been a terrible pandemic and stocks fell more than 30%. We don\u2019t know if the ultimate lows are in this time, but so far, history is rhyming.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 6.) More than 20 million people in the US lost their jobs in April, while the unemployment rate soared to near 15%, the highest since the Great Depression. Record drops in manufacturing, industrial production, retail sales, and consumer spending have all taken place in the past two months as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 7.) A recession is here, ending the streak of 128 months in a row without one. What is unique about the previous expansion was nominal gross domestic product (GDP) grew only 50%, about the average growth seen during the previous expansions, but this expansion was nearly twice as long as the average expansion (10 years versus 5 years).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 8.) The bounce off of the March 23 S&amp;P 500 lows has been historic in many ways. In fact, it was one of the best 20-day rallies ever, with previous best rallies seeing strong returns 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 9.) As scary as it was on the way down, stocks have come roaring back, gaining more than 35% from the March 23 lows. This would classify as the greatest bear market bounce ever, which opens the question: is this more than a bear market bounce and instead the start of a new bull market?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 10.) The number of COVID-19 tests in the US nearly doubled in May versus what was seen in April. Additionally, fewer and fewer tests are coming back positive. Testing is one of the key ways we will beat this and this is a step in the right direction. We\u2019ve also seen new monthly lows in people on ventilators, in the ICU, and in hospitals.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Hard to believe, but there are still 7 months left in 2020. It hasn\u2019t been easy for any of us, and we continue to keep everyone impacted by this pandemic in mind, but we continue to see the glass as half full. The dual benefit of record monetary and fiscal policy should help create a bridge to help those most impacted, while the economy can slowly come back online later this year.\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$ADBE** \n&gt; * **$UNFI** \n&gt; * **$CHWY** \n&gt; * **$TIF** \n&gt; * **$LULU** \n&gt; * **$COUP** \n&gt; * **$SFIX** \n&gt; * **$LOVE** \n&gt; * **$NEPT** \n&gt; * **$GHM** \n&gt; * **$REVG** \n&gt; * **$GME** \n&gt; * **$HDS** \n&gt; * **$FIVE** \n&gt; * **$SIG** \n&gt; * **$CASY** \n&gt; * **$CVGW** \n&gt; * **$AMC** \n&gt; * **$FCEL** \n&gt; * **$QTNT** \n&gt; * **$PLCE** \n&gt; * **$CHS** \n&gt; * **$THO** \n&gt; * **$GCO** \n&gt; * **$BF.B** \n&gt; * **$LMNR** \n&gt; * **$WSG** \n&gt; * **$PRTY** \n&gt; * **$GES** \n&gt; * **$BBCP** \n&gt; * **$CONN** \n&gt; * **$HEXO** \n&gt; * **$PHR** \n&gt; * **$PVH** \n&gt; * **$RRGB** \n&gt; * **$PLAY** \n&gt; * **$TNP** \n&gt; * **$JW.A** \n&gt; * **$SB** \n&gt; * **$GSM** \n&gt; * **$SRT**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/bgPdMCr.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.8.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/d2EW1kr.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uxSiJJr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.9.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3SIjcG7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cRBrPlt.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.10.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DaheXAm.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9mcHxTl.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.11.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/i8SNjWM.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9xcBZPK.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.12.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Inc. $392.90\n&gt; **Adobe Inc.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 8th, 2020.\n\n# **Look for the S&amp;P 500 to turn positive for the year with a boost from the Fed in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/05/look-for-the-sp-500-to-turn-positive-for-the-year-with-a-boost-from-the-fed-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to reassure markets next week the central bank will do whatever it takes to help the economy heal. That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting is the big event for markets in the coming week. There are a few economic reports, including inflation data, the consumer price index Wednesday and producer prices Thursday. Weekly jobless claims will be important Thursday to see if there\u2019s a drop in continuing clams, after May\u2019s employment report showed a surprising record gain of 2.5 million jobs.\n*****\n&gt; The reopening trade was in full swing in the past week, especially Friday when stocks surged on the jobs report, which was expected to show a loss of 8.3 million jobs. The Nasdaq broke above its record high set on Feb. 19, and the S&amp;P 500 was just 1.1% away from turning positive for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Even before the jobs report, investors were loading up on financials, industrials, transports and small caps, which were up more than 8% for the week and 18.4% in the past month. S&amp;P financials were 12.1% higher on the week, S&amp;P industrials were up 10.5, and the NYSE airline index jumped more than 35.4.%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think next week is dominated by the reopening and it will be for another month,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. \u201cWith cyclicals outperforming, small [caps] outperforming, credit spreads coming in and then the bond yields going up, everybody \u2014 all facets of the financial markets \u2014 are sort of suggesting the same outcome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 3,193, a gain of 4.9%, and now traders are watching to see if it can scale the psychological 3,200 level. The Dow closed Friday at 27,110, up 6.8% for the week, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.4%, at 9,814 after reaching an intraday record high of 9,845 Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts say the market will likely look past the protests that broke out in cities across the U.S. after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Four policemen were charged with murder in his death. Looters joined the protests, some of which turned violent, but they quieted down towards the end of the week.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher for a third week in a row, but a change this past week has been the abrupt lurch higher in Treasury yields. The 10-year rose to a high of 0.95% Friday, a quarter-point move in just three sessions. The move was already underway but got a lift Wednesday when ADP jobs data was not nearly as bad as expected. Yields ripped even higher after the May employment report showed the unemployment rate actually fell to 13.3%, instead of climbing to 20%, as expected by economists.\n*****\n&gt; Bond strategists said the Treasury market was now acknowledging the potential for a recovery, but not in the exuberant way the stock market has been. Since March 23, the S&amp;P 500 has risen more than 45%, but it took the 10-year Treasury until this week to get back the yield level it was at when stocks bottomed.\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen said he believes a new bull market has been launched, but there could be pullbacks and some headwinds for the market coming up.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhen GDP is minus 30%, other issues don\u2019t matter. There\u2019s just one issue. But as the economy reopens again, the trade battles will matter again, presidential politics will matter again,\u201d said Paulsen, adding the budget deficit could also matter. \u201cI think we\u2019ll get removed from a sole focus. That isn\u2019t quite there but I think it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed begins its two-day meeting Tuesday, and will release its statement Wednesday afternoon, followed by a video briefing by Powell.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhey would the Fed want to disrupt this with anything?\u201d Paulsen said. \u201cThey\u2019re still going to support the economy. They\u2019re going to stay away from negative rates or yield curve management. They\u2019re not going to do anything to scare the markets. They might certainly reassure people that they are still ready to provide support.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America, said the Fed may clarify where it stands on some of the extraordinary moves it has taken since it cut rates to zero. The Fed has been supporting the markets with asset purchases and multiple programs for commercial paper, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds, for example.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe think right now they\u2019re just trying to get this Main Street lending program to work. The question is are they going to do more things around what they do in terms of forward guidance and next steps of macro easing,\u201d Harris said.\n*****\n&gt; There has been speculation that the Fed would do some type of so-called yield curve control, a program to keep interest rates capped at certain levels. \u201cI think it\u2019s too early for that,\u201d said Harris. He said the Fed would be guaranteeing low rates for a long period of time if it does yield curve control.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYield curve control is basically open-ended quantitative easing,\u201d he said. The Fed is currently buying Treasurys but if it wanted to stop yields from rising too much as the economy improves, it could make targeted purchases.\n*****\n&gt; Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said it\u2019s possible the Fed could announce the yield curve control. \u201cWe\u2019ve said they could implement yield curve control out to three years,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my mind that matches the length of the horizon of the economic projections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Powell has said the economy needs more fiscal help, and he could reiterate those comments Wednesday. President Donald Trump on Friday said he backs more stimulus. So far, the Democrats have put out a marker with their wish list for further spending, but there have been no negotiations.\n*****\n&gt; There was concern the strong jobs report could make it harder to get buy in for another big spending package. But some economists say the recovery needs a boost and states need funding to fill the holes in their budgets from coronavirus-related spending and a lack of tax receipts.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7klaXQm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PKTBzT2.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/a5JkAB6.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/M2x4Qoq.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qtJYfXN.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bjiJWjV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UAi19KJ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GQm4ruO.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uV1U7FN.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/wm2XJND.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yarkiMO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hFblu2G.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Stocks Outpacing Analyst Price Targets\n\n&gt; This morning's jobs report shocked the financial world -- most notably the economists whose job it is to provide estimates. The consensus estimate among economists for May nonfarm payrolls was projecting a loss of more than 7 million jobs. The actual number that was reported did not just show a smaller than expected job loss, but it actually showed a gain in jobs of more than 2.5 million.\n\n&gt; We're seeing a similar situation play out in the equity analyst community. With the S&amp;P 500 now up 40%+ since its low less than three months ago, the average stock in the index is now trading above its consensus analyst price target that looks 12 months out. Analysts have simply not been able to catch up to the rapid rise we've seen for equity prices.\n\n&gt; It's extremely rare to see share prices move above consensus analyst price targets. We don't have the historical daily data on this, but anecdotally we can't remember a time when the spread has been this wide. As shown below, at the end of 2019 when the S&amp;P finished a massive rally, equity prices were 5.5% below the consensus price target. That was seen as a very tight spread prior to what we're seeing now. At the lows in March, the average share price had dropped all the way to $92.50 compared to an average consensus price target of $143.20. That projected a gain of 54.9% at the time!\n\n&gt; Since March 23rd, the average share price has risen from $92.50 up to $138.40, while the average analyst price target has fallen from $143.20 to $136. Current price targets no longer project a gain for the average S&amp;P 500 stock, but rather a 1.7% drop.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/avgpricetarget.png))**\n\n&gt; # Nasdaq's Historical Run\n\n&gt; At its highs earlier this morning, the Nasdaq Composite was within 2% of its record high from earlier in the year. Besides the steep V-shape of the Nasdaq's pattern over the last four months, the other aspect of the chart that stands out is just how steep the 50-day moving average is trending lately.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-50DMAa.png))**\n\n&gt; To illustrate just how steep the Nasdaq's 50-DMA has become, the chart below shows the daily percentage change of the 50-day going back to 1971. Currently, the Nasdaq 50-DMA is rising at an average of over 0.5% per day. That's an incredible slope and a level that has been exceeded only a handful of times in the Nasdaq's 50-year history.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-Composite1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Big Gains From Smaller Tech\n\n&gt; It's still difficult to fathom the moves in the US equity market over the last four months. The fact that the Nasdaq and more specifically the Technology sector aren't far from record highs is definitely something no one was expecting two months ago. There's an old market saying that equities take the stairs up and the elevator down, but in the latest market cycle, the elevator up was almost as fast as the way down!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Nasdaq.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Technology-Sector.png))**\n\n&gt; If you've been following the markets, all you've likely heard up until recently is that large-cap tech, and more specifically, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Facebook (FB), are single-handedly driving the market higher. The reality is not nearly as clear-cut. Given their market caps, the \"Big 5\" (as they're often referred to) have done a lot of heavy lifting, but in terms of performance, they're hardly the only game in town.\n\n&gt; The table below lists Technology sector stocks in the Russell 3000 with market caps of more than $1 billion that are outperforming all of the 'big 5' tech stocks on a YTD basis. Actually, since Amazon is doing so well relative to the rest of the \"big 5\" these are all stocks that are outperforming Amazon. If we looked for stocks that were doing better than the average return of the \"big 5\" the list would be a lot, lot longer (+16.4%).\n\n&gt; Looking through the list of names below, the two top-performing names are Zscaler (ZS) and Twilio (TWLO), which have both more than doubled. Behind these two, DocuSign (DOCU) and Sprout Social (SPT) are both knocking on the door of triple-digits. All 28 of the names listed have market caps of $1 billion, but the average market cap is just over $21 billion, while Nvidia (NVDA) is the largest company on the list with a market cap of $216 billion. For the most part, these aren't names that have been driving the indices, but anyone holding these stocks in their portfolio probably doesn't care!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Tech-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Best 50-Day Rally Ever\n\n&gt; In many ways, what we\u2019ve seen so far in 2020 has been both record-breaking and devastating. From the S&amp;P 500 Index peak on February 19 to the bear market lows March 23, stocks lost 33.9%. Now, 50 trading days later, stocks have gained 39.6%, for the largest 50-day rally since the S&amp;P 500 moved to 500 stocks in 1957.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere are no rollercoasters that can replicate what stocks have done so far in 2020,\u201d exclaimed LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHere\u2019s the catch though: Big 50-day rallies in the past have taken place near the start of new bull markets, and the returns going out a year were quite bullish.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 39.6% gain in 50 days was the greatest 50-day rally ever, besting the previous best in October 1982. What\u2019s important to note here is that many of these rallies took place coming off major market lows, and delivered quite strong returns going out 6 to 12 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/best-fifty-days.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Although we have near-term worries given this historic run, as some sentiment indicators such as put/call ratios are showing some froth, from a bigger picture perspective, this strong 50-day rally offers a reason to think stock prices may be even higher this time next year.\n\n*****\n\n# 2020 In Charts\n\n&gt; 2020 is only five months old, but in many ways it is one of the most historic years we\u2019ve ever seen. \u201c2020 went from moving along nicely, to seeing the worst recession in a generation and the fastest bear market ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cNow stocks are in the midst of one of the best bull runs ever, even though the economy remains extremely weak, thanks to record stimulus and hopes over a vaccine.\u201d\n&gt; \nTo best sum it all up, here are 10 charts that tell the picture of 2020 so far.\n\n&gt; 1.) The 2010s were the first decade in history to go all 10 years without a recession, which of course ended just months into the new decade, as the economy stopped. Stocks gained 13.5% on an annual basis last decade, surprisingly, only the third-best decade over the past four.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 2.) This is an election year, and the S&amp;P 500 Index hasn\u2019t been lower when a President is up for reelection since FDR in 1940. Although this seemed nearly impossible at the March lows, it is looking like this incredible streak could have a chance in 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 3.) One of the first signs something could go wrong in 2020 was stocks fell in January. Historically, this has meant potential trouble for the final 11 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 4.) As fears over COVID-19 gripped the world, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its fastest bear market ever, in only 19 days. To put this in perspective, this was the fastest bear market in the 124-year history of the Dow.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 5.) Mark Twain said \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes\u201d. Looking at history, every 50 years there has been a terrible pandemic and stocks fell more than 30%. We don\u2019t know if the ultimate lows are in this time, but so far, history is rhyming.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 6.) More than 20 million people in the US lost their jobs in April, while the unemployment rate soared to near 15%, the highest since the Great Depression. Record drops in manufacturing, industrial production, retail sales, and consumer spending have all taken place in the past two months as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 7.) A recession is here, ending the streak of 128 months in a row without one. What is unique about the previous expansion was nominal gross domestic product (GDP) grew only 50%, about the average growth seen during the previous expansions, but this expansion was nearly twice as long as the average expansion (10 years versus 5 years).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 8.) The bounce off of the March 23 S&amp;P 500 lows has been historic in many ways. In fact, it was one of the best 20-day rallies ever, with previous best rallies seeing strong returns 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 9.) As scary as it was on the way down, stocks have come roaring back, gaining more than 35% from the March 23 lows. This would classify as the greatest bear market bounce ever, which opens the question: is this more than a bear market bounce and instead the start of a new bull market?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 10.) The number of COVID-19 tests in the US nearly doubled in May versus what was seen in April. Additionally, fewer and fewer tests are coming back positive. Testing is one of the key ways we will beat this and this is a step in the right direction.

I have a 25k account and everyday I've been picking companies I like that seem like they're in an uptrend and where OTM probability is above ~70%.\n\nI'm realizing that with a 25k account, I can't exactly sell CSPs with stocks like MSFT (or anything above $100) without it binding up a large % of my capital. So I've been mainly seeking companies with stocks priced around the $10-30 range. \n\nI was curious though, if I felt strongly about getting into a position with a company with a stock priced much higher, if credit spreads made sense with this strategy. I know it's a bit of a deviation but it's kind of along the same idea. Just want to see if there are glaring issues with long put credit spread in lieu of a CSP. Is this what others who implement the Wheel do when do they have necessary capital for a particular underlying?\n\nAlso, I've been selling one CSP a day with different stocks (to diversify) but wondering if others implementing this strategy often continue to sell the same underlying over and over just at different strikes/dates?\n\nLastly, how much of your capital do you keep tied up? Is there a good rule of thumb ratio?",

My idea is to put it all into MSFT and let it ride for a while because based on my understanding from readings, it seems Microsoft is continuing to solidify their enterprise business and overall it looks well positioned in the market. \n\nFrom a technical perspective, it seems that the price level is holding steady in the $17x- $18x range, and with continued positive development, it holds great potential to breakout post Q2 earnings. \n\nA lot of you guys here are more educated at this than I am, so please give me your thoughts on MSFT, and/or if you can contribute ideas on alternative trading strategies I should explore more in-depth, it would be greatly appreciated\n....\n\nMy experience in investing is limited. I dabbled in the markets back in 2015/16, and made some bad decisions trying to day trade low value names in hopes that they would shoot up fast, and I made mistakes which ended up costing me about 2k at the time. It sucked, but I look at it as a relatively small price to pay to learn some valuable lessons. I lost motivation though and focused more on my regular job, missing out on the great bull market that ensued after. \n\nI don't want to make irrational decisions this time around. My primary goal right now is to just make some solid judgement calls and make a positive return on my investment (even if its small), I just want to regain some confidence in my investing self.",

        "selftext": "Three months into stonking.  My observations...\n\nI think I\u2019m a pretty smart guy, so I was excited to touch and feel my way through the market once it tanked and there were no sports to bet on.  As I sit here writing this, I\u2019m up 32% (today was ugly) since I started, with a portfolio of $15k.\n\n30% DKNG\n\n20% BLMN\n\n13% TSLA\n\n13% MSFT\n\n12% AAPL\n\n10% FB\n\n1% G NUS\n\nA handful of small call options (purchased from $1-$200) make up the remainder. \n\nHere are some of my thoughts:\n\n1.) DON\u2019T. SELL. EARLY:  This is more so if you\u2019re down early.  IE: I scooped up CEQP and G NUS after some DD and discussions, and knee jerk sold them after a few bad hours.  If you\u2019re investing in something, believe in it.  If you believe in it, you should also believe that it can have a bad day or two, just like us.  \n\n\n2.) Timing the market is a fruitless exercise.  Daily peaks and valleys seem like an eternity when you refresh your app 100x a day, but the reality of the matter is most 3M/1YR/5YR charts show a much more continuous slope on stock +\\-.   DCA is a much much more diligent tactic, or just buying every week.  Unless of course you\u2019re a DT, but I don\u2019t have $25k.\n\n3.)  Know your strategy ahead of time.  Is this for retirement?  Is this to make some extra $ every week?   I\u2019ve finally settled into about an 85/15 ratio, with the 15 representing my short holds which I try to make quick $ off of (this includes selling options for equity profit).  \n\n4.). I truly believe that Reddit influences the market.  I really do.   I know people will scoff and think I\u2019m an idiot, and god damnit maybe i am.  But look at \u201cmeme\u201d stocks that get takes about CONSTANTLY in here (G NUS, VTIX, DKNG, TSLA to an extent, etc).  Look at the volume on them too.  WSB is a graveyard full of puts worshipers who think it\u2019ll be a Bear Market til we die.  I prefer the r/stocks forum much more.  Regardless, I would argue that many a pump-and-dump have been driven home by this very audience.  \n\n5.)  Dont beat yourself up over missed profits IF you still profited.  Example: I\u2019m a Barstool Sports Guy, not really a Stoolie since I\u2019m 34 with a wife and kids, but I like their stuff.  Except Davey Day Trader, that shit is so stupid. Anyway... TL;DR, loved Penn once I heard about that merger, bought when they plummeted to $5.40 a share, and sold for $14.  I missed out on a TON of money, but I still made nearly 2x what I invested.  \n\n6.) I monitor volume, call prices, and resistance points when buying now.  Three things I\u2019ve found more valuable than others.  I do not think i know enough about business at the highest level to give too much thought to market cap.  Also, if a stock just can\u2019t seem to get past or far past a particular $$ amount time after time, that\u2019s a red flag for me as well. \n\n7.)  Dont buy or sell the first and last 30 min of each day, unless you really really have a good feeling about something.  People buying up and/or selling off the first and last half hour of each day is a real thing (330-4 is seemingly always a ski slope of red, but I think that can be attributed to the market being very bullish the last few weeks). If you\u2019re holding an option on a stock that went to the moon after hours, and you\u2019re looking to sell the option, do it the SECOND the market opens up.  \n\n\n8.)  Option trading is the tits if done right.  Unless the stock is going to Mars, I\u2019m selling the option and not executing it.  You can find some real profitable peaks when tracking the value of your call options.  I\u2019ll never ever dabble in puts unless we\u2019ve confirmed that a meteor is about to hit.  \n\n\nThat is all.",

        "selftext": "Wanted to change these posts a little in order to incorporate a greater amount of information without it being too overloaded. The post might be a little longer than previous, but gives a better overview of the company imo.\n\n**Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)**\n\nJohnson &amp; Johnson is a multinational healthcare conglomerate that is known for producing pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and healthcare products such as baby care, the skin care product line Neutrogena, and over-the-counter medicines such as Tylenol. Although they've recently been making [headlines](https://www.cancerhealth.com/article/johnson-johnson-ends-north-american-sales-talcbased-baby-powder) for the wrong reasons due to their talc-based baby powder, their massive reach into all major areas of healthcare make them a flagship of the sector and a smart choice for any investor's portfolio.\n\nThe company is divided into 3 main segments:\n\n- Consumer Healthcare - baby care, skin &amp; hair care, wound care &amp; topicals, OTC medicines\n- Medical Devices - diabetes care &amp; insulin delivery, various surgery related devices, orthopedics\n- Pharmaceuticals - drugs for immunology, neuroscience, infectious diseases and oncology \n\n**JNJ Financials Breakdown**\n\n- Consumer Healthcare - $13.9B = 17% of total sales (+0.3% vs 2018)\n- Medical Devices - $26B = 32% of total sales (-3.8% vs 2018)\n- Pharmaceuticals - $42.2B = 51% of total sales (+3.6% vs 2018)\n\nNet Sales: $82.1B; $42B U.S. sales, $40B International sales\n\nResearch &amp; Development Expenses: $11.3B total, a 5.4% increase over 2018; Consumer Healthcare: $493M, Medical Devices: $2B, Pharmaceuticals: $8.8B\n\nNet Earnings: $15.1B in 2019; $15.3B in 2018\n\nNet Assets: $157.7B with $17.3B in cash &amp; cash equivalents\n\nLiabilities: $98.3B in total liabilities with $26.5B in long term debt\n\n[Data from 2019 10-K](https://johnsonandjohnson.gcs-web.com/static-files/ffd0ad42-ac56-4fd4-8fc2-b033c4ed62c6)\n\n**Other Information**\n\nJNJ is one of only 2 companies rated by S&amp;P as having AAA credit. (Microsoft is the other) [More information on S&amp;P credit ratings can be found here](https://www.standardandpoors.com/en_US/web/guest/article/-/view/sourceId/504352)\n\nJNJ is a dividend king (50+ consecutive years of increasing dividends) with a current streak of 57 years. It is one of only 28 companies to be included on this prestigious list. The stock's current yield is 2.79%. [A good resource on Dividend Kings from one of my favorite sites can be found here](https://www.suredividend.com/dividend-kings/)\n\nJNJ operates in more than 60 countries with 134,000 employees and more than 250 subsidiary companies.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nJohnson &amp; Johnson is one of the largest companies in the world with an impressive portfolio of healthcare products. $40B in international sales and operations in over 60 countries gives them an enormous economic moat and access to markets all over the world. Their sales numbers are solid, and have increased in each of the last 5 years. Earnings dropped slightly compared to 2018 but their R&amp;D expenses increased, indicating they are dedicated to innovation and developing additional new healthcare products. The current pandemic and economic turmoil shouldn't significantly affect their short term financials, and long term they are well positioned for continued success.\n\nDespite their controversies over the years, I think JNJ is a great choice for any investor looking for a long term buy-and-hold healthcare stock. Even after sales in baby care products declined by 10% in 2019, their Consumer Healthcare segment still finished the year with a net increase in sales of 0.3%. While this is due to the massive array of other products they sell, it also highlights how one area of business under-performing doesn't drag the entire company down. The stock isn't a fast mover, but being up 44% over the last 5 years is still respectable growth. With a dividend yield of 2.79% and solid cash flow they have plenty of room to grow their dividend over time as well.",

        "selftext": "I might be completely wrong but I've been observing $ZM since the early start of the pandemic, and I don't believe the stock is a good long-term play. Here are the reasons why I am bearish on the company:\n\n* **Competitive space**. Zoom is competing with many other video conferencing tools: Google Meet (previously, Google Hangouts, $GOOG/L), Skype as well as Teams ($MSFT), and Slack (also offering video calls aside from chat, $WORK) to name a few. All of these provide both free and enterprise plans, and as you can see, many of them are backed by big monopoly tech. There are also smaller players trying to break through like join.me.\n* **Security concerns**. Zoom does not have proper end-to-end encryption. It's been found to transmit its encryption keys and even route the actual calls through China, supposedly by mistake. Despite being a Silicon Valley company, they have much of their staff in China as well. The software itself has been through several privacy scandals, particularly in June 2019 with MacOS users discovering that their camera could be activated by malicious sites due to a vulnerability in Zoom.\n* **Government regulation**. Zoom has alleged ties to China, and with the current US-China tensions, it's at high risk of being regulated. It's already been banned from use by several government agencies (NASA, military) and companies (Google, SpaceX). The precedent has already been set with Huawei, and if the anti-China sentiment and trade sanctions continue to grow, possibly evolving into a cold war, you can expect more scrutiny directed towards this company.\n* **Inflated fundamentals**. The stock is currently trading at a P/E near 6,000 and is slightly down from its ATH this week. It's likely priced for perfection in anticipation of very strong demand even as the economy continues to re-open. Even if you're optimistic about the work-from-home culture and online learning, it's hard to justify its current valuation that probably only compares to that of $SHOP or $OKTA.\n\nAgain, I could be 100% wrong, but I don't think Zoom stands a chance against the big tech like Google and Microsoft. Those are diversified monopoly companies that could push Zoom out of the video conferencing space, especially with the help of government intervention from the US and EU. Zoom may still find a market in Asia, possibly Russia and Africa, but I believe its prospects in the Western world are rather grim.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

There has been an acceleration toward this reality but it's still early in the overall development cycle. \n\nPhysical and monetary assets being virtualized has recently been accelerated in importance and this will have positive effects, across time, on businesses that focus on securing those assets in its time spent delivering on multiple ultra-high-speed networks across the world.  Computing is getting cheaper and easier to distribute in rather extreme ways and the execution of these ideas is happening right now.\n\nThe need for secure video, transactions, VR, and user experiences will be dramatically shot up and this is evident across many exciting technologies like Apple VR, Google Gaming, Square Banking, Facebook Shops with VR shopping, Microsoft software automations, and government developments.\n\nInfrastructure that support these interactive ecosystems will be growing at incredible rates. NET is one of the best positioned companies to pioneer this market.\n\n[This graph has been crunched where 2019 skips straight to 2021-2023 levels.](https://preview.redd.it/2u6ede9bul251.png?width=1392&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95bf6696f2deaec72d5b3cce869d0aef5d2e59f9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# My motivation\n\nCloudFlare is releasing and bolstering support for streaming, video, and communications as a security-first cloud provider in the following week. This, on top of its rapidly growing developer platform, is consequential for many reasons as a market-mover in the industry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# In Short\n\nCloudFlare so far has been shredding forward across multiple technical markets competing against by:\n\n\\- Competing marketshare against CISCO, Palo Alto Networks, and other hardware customers \n\n\\- Offering a way to not lock your organization into a big tech vendor\n\n\\- Promoting security and challenging Big Tech's direction with web development\n\n\\- Forming positive relationships with Shopify, Facebook, JD, Twitter, Baidu, TOR, and Microsoft\n\n\\- Pioneering the ease-of-use privacy movement with [1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1) and distributing VPNs.\n\n\\- Growing a rapid, robust, cost-effective, and secure network across the world \n\n\\- \\*\\*Providing a development platform that promotes the use extremely powerful and 'cutting edge'  computing. -&gt; YOU ARE HERE\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Co-founder of NPM, a system developers used to send software modules.

A content delivery network.\n\nCDNs are distributed datacenters. This technology has been rapidly improving in the past 5 years and has drastically reduced the cost of business for small businesses and enterprises alike.\n\nThinking trucking logistics. You need to load up and send heavy duty materials, safely, quickly, and across multiple checkpoints along a highway.\n\nAn easy way to think about CDNs is to imagine it as the E in 4G LTE (Long Term Evolution). Through the power of CDNs, you're able to render images, videos, streams, content, data, transactions, privacy, and much more through the network.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[As a pioneer in the e-commerce space](https://preview.redd.it/dnpn9c3t4m251.png?width=2210&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2be51c709a803d5dbac47c4bb471d9ca77bc047c)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# Why does this market matter? Competitive advantages\n\nThe reason Snapchat did not gain any traction did not gain any traction outside of the US was because Facebook provided a fundamentally faster service across WhatsApp and Instagram. Facebook's investment in networking infrastructure allowed them to create a product that was fast , cheap and would work in various rural or economic conditions. Snapchat never stood a chance in the global social media landscape as a result.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# What's special about CloudFlare as a network?\n\nWhat CloudFlare specifically offers against its competitors is its privacy-first approach. CloudFlare is essentially a distributed private network (VPN) with a massive infrastructure effort to send data around the world safely and cheaply.  Privacy and speed sells.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Facebook: \\\\\"The future is private\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/gn6ibx4p4m251.png?width=1306&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a88aa1e694ab0e62af8856bdeae914f62cd7182)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/me09oa3pem251.png?width=2332&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=658486274c4b3c61fa689c5166b14f8c5775a953\n\n\\# What is serverless computing?\n\nServerless computing allows a 25 year old developer like me run 5 different businesses on my dinky little Macintosh while I let Google and Cloudflare run my servers under an extremely cheap pricing model.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 8th, 2020.\n\n# **Look for the S&amp;P 500 to turn positive for the year with a boost from the Fed in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/05/look-for-the-sp-500-to-turn-positive-for-the-year-with-a-boost-from-the-fed-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to reassure markets next week the central bank will do whatever it takes to help the economy heal. That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting is the big event for markets in the coming week. There are a few economic reports, including inflation data, the consumer price index Wednesday and producer prices Thursday. Weekly jobless claims will be important Thursday to see if there\u2019s a drop in continuing clams, after May\u2019s employment report showed a surprising record gain of 2.5 million jobs.\n*****\n&gt; The reopening trade was in full swing in the past week, especially Friday when stocks surged on the jobs report, which was expected to show a loss of 8.3 million jobs. The Nasdaq broke above its record high set on Feb. 19, and the S&amp;P 500 was just 1.1% away from turning positive for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Even before the jobs report, investors were loading up on financials, industrials, transports and small caps, which were up more than 8% for the week and 18.4% in the past month. S&amp;P financials were 12.1% higher on the week, S&amp;P industrials were up 10.5, and the NYSE airline index jumped more than 35.4.%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think next week is dominated by the reopening and it will be for another month,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. \u201cWith cyclicals outperforming, small [caps] outperforming, credit spreads coming in and then the bond yields going up, everybody \u2014 all facets of the financial markets \u2014 are sort of suggesting the same outcome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 3,193, a gain of 4.9%, and now traders are watching to see if it can scale the psychological 3,200 level. The Dow closed Friday at 27,110, up 6.8% for the week, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.4%, at 9,814 after reaching an intraday record high of 9,845 Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts say the market will likely look past the protests that broke out in cities across the U.S. after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Four policemen were charged with murder in his death. Looters joined the protests, some of which turned violent, but they quieted down towards the end of the week.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher for a third week in a row, but a change this past week has been the abrupt lurch higher in Treasury yields. The 10-year rose to a high of 0.95% Friday, a quarter-point move in just three sessions. The move was already underway but got a lift Wednesday when ADP jobs data was not nearly as bad as expected. Yields ripped even higher after the May employment report showed the unemployment rate actually fell to 13.3%, instead of climbing to 20%, as expected by economists.\n*****\n&gt; Bond strategists said the Treasury market was now acknowledging the potential for a recovery, but not in the exuberant way the stock market has been. Since March 23, the S&amp;P 500 has risen more than 45%, but it took the 10-year Treasury until this week to get back the yield level it was at when stocks bottomed.\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen said he believes a new bull market has been launched, but there could be pullbacks and some headwinds for the market coming up.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhen GDP is minus 30%, other issues don\u2019t matter. There\u2019s just one issue. But as the economy reopens again, the trade battles will matter again, presidential politics will matter again,\u201d said Paulsen, adding the budget deficit could also matter. \u201cI think we\u2019ll get removed from a sole focus. That isn\u2019t quite there but I think it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed begins its two-day meeting Tuesday, and will release its statement Wednesday afternoon, followed by a video briefing by Powell.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhey would the Fed want to disrupt this with anything?\u201d Paulsen said. \u201cThey\u2019re still going to support the economy. They\u2019re going to stay away from negative rates or yield curve management. They\u2019re not going to do anything to scare the markets. They might certainly reassure people that they are still ready to provide support.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America, said the Fed may clarify where it stands on some of the extraordinary moves it has taken since it cut rates to zero. The Fed has been supporting the markets with asset purchases and multiple programs for commercial paper, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds, for example.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe think right now they\u2019re just trying to get this Main Street lending program to work. The question is are they going to do more things around what they do in terms of forward guidance and next steps of macro easing,\u201d Harris said.\n*****\n&gt; There has been speculation that the Fed would do some type of so-called yield curve control, a program to keep interest rates capped at certain levels. \u201cI think it\u2019s too early for that,\u201d said Harris. He said the Fed would be guaranteeing low rates for a long period of time if it does yield curve control.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYield curve control is basically open-ended quantitative easing,\u201d he said. The Fed is currently buying Treasurys but if it wanted to stop yields from rising too much as the economy improves, it could make targeted purchases.\n*****\n&gt; Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said it\u2019s possible the Fed could announce the yield curve control. \u201cWe\u2019ve said they could implement yield curve control out to three years,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my mind that matches the length of the horizon of the economic projections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Powell has said the economy needs more fiscal help, and he could reiterate those comments Wednesday. President Donald Trump on Friday said he backs more stimulus. So far, the Democrats have put out a marker with their wish list for further spending, but there have been no negotiations.\n*****\n&gt; There was concern the strong jobs report could make it harder to get buy in for another big spending package. But some economists say the recovery needs a boost and states need funding to fill the holes in their budgets from coronavirus-related spending and a lack of tax receipts.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7klaXQm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PKTBzT2.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/a5JkAB6.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/M2x4Qoq.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qtJYfXN.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bjiJWjV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UAi19KJ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GQm4ruO.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uV1U7FN.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/wm2XJND.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yarkiMO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hFblu2G.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Stocks Outpacing Analyst Price Targets\n\n&gt; This morning's jobs report shocked the financial world -- most notably the economists whose job it is to provide estimates. The consensus estimate among economists for May nonfarm payrolls was projecting a loss of more than 7 million jobs. The actual number that was reported did not just show a smaller than expected job loss, but it actually showed a gain in jobs of more than 2.5 million.\n\n&gt; We're seeing a similar situation play out in the equity analyst community. With the S&amp;P 500 now up 40%+ since its low less than three months ago, the average stock in the index is now trading above its consensus analyst price target that looks 12 months out. Analysts have simply not been able to catch up to the rapid rise we've seen for equity prices.\n\n&gt; It's extremely rare to see share prices move above consensus analyst price targets. We don't have the historical daily data on this, but anecdotally we can't remember a time when the spread has been this wide. As shown below, at the end of 2019 when the S&amp;P finished a massive rally, equity prices were 5.5% below the consensus price target. That was seen as a very tight spread prior to what we're seeing now. At the lows in March, the average share price had dropped all the way to $92.50 compared to an average consensus price target of $143.20. That projected a gain of 54.9% at the time!\n\n&gt; Since March 23rd, the average share price has risen from $92.50 up to $138.40, while the average analyst price target has fallen from $143.20 to $136. Current price targets no longer project a gain for the average S&amp;P 500 stock, but rather a 1.7% drop.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/avgpricetarget.png))**\n\n&gt; # Nasdaq's Historical Run\n\n&gt; At its highs earlier this morning, the Nasdaq Composite was within 2% of its record high from earlier in the year. Besides the steep V-shape of the Nasdaq's pattern over the last four months, the other aspect of the chart that stands out is just how steep the 50-day moving average is trending lately.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-50DMAa.png))**\n\n&gt; To illustrate just how steep the Nasdaq's 50-DMA has become, the chart below shows the daily percentage change of the 50-day going back to 1971. Currently, the Nasdaq 50-DMA is rising at an average of over 0.5% per day. That's an incredible slope and a level that has been exceeded only a handful of times in the Nasdaq's 50-year history.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-Composite1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Big Gains From Smaller Tech\n\n&gt; It's still difficult to fathom the moves in the US equity market over the last four months. The fact that the Nasdaq and more specifically the Technology sector aren't far from record highs is definitely something no one was expecting two months ago. There's an old market saying that equities take the stairs up and the elevator down, but in the latest market cycle, the elevator up was almost as fast as the way down!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Nasdaq.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Technology-Sector.png))**\n\n&gt; If you've been following the markets, all you've likely heard up until recently is that large-cap tech, and more specifically, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Facebook (FB), are single-handedly driving the market higher. The reality is not nearly as clear-cut. Given their market caps, the \"Big 5\" (as they're often referred to) have done a lot of heavy lifting, but in terms of performance, they're hardly the only game in town.\n\n&gt; The table below lists Technology sector stocks in the Russell 3000 with market caps of more than $1 billion that are outperforming all of the 'big 5' tech stocks on a YTD basis. Actually, since Amazon is doing so well relative to the rest of the \"big 5\" these are all stocks that are outperforming Amazon. If we looked for stocks that were doing better than the average return of the \"big 5\" the list would be a lot, lot longer (+16.4%).\n\n&gt; Looking through the list of names below, the two top-performing names are Zscaler (ZS) and Twilio (TWLO), which have both more than doubled. Behind these two, DocuSign (DOCU) and Sprout Social (SPT) are both knocking on the door of triple-digits. All 28 of the names listed have market caps of $1 billion, but the average market cap is just over $21 billion, while Nvidia (NVDA) is the largest company on the list with a market cap of $216 billion. For the most part, these aren't names that have been driving the indices, but anyone holding these stocks in their portfolio probably doesn't care!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Tech-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Best 50-Day Rally Ever\n\n&gt; In many ways, what we\u2019ve seen so far in 2020 has been both record-breaking and devastating. From the S&amp;P 500 Index peak on February 19 to the bear market lows March 23, stocks lost 33.9%. Now, 50 trading days later, stocks have gained 39.6%, for the largest 50-day rally since the S&amp;P 500 moved to 500 stocks in 1957.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere are no rollercoasters that can replicate what stocks have done so far in 2020,\u201d exclaimed LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHere\u2019s the catch though: Big 50-day rallies in the past have taken place near the start of new bull markets, and the returns going out a year were quite bullish.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 39.6% gain in 50 days was the greatest 50-day rally ever, besting the previous best in October 1982. What\u2019s important to note here is that many of these rallies took place coming off major market lows, and delivered quite strong returns going out 6 to 12 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/best-fifty-days.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Although we have near-term worries given this historic run, as some sentiment indicators such as put/call ratios are showing some froth, from a bigger picture perspective, this strong 50-day rally offers a reason to think stock prices may be even higher this time next year.\n\n*****\n\n# 2020 In Charts\n\n&gt; 2020 is only five months old, but in many ways it is one of the most historic years we\u2019ve ever seen. \u201c2020 went from moving along nicely, to seeing the worst recession in a generation and the fastest bear market ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cNow stocks are in the midst of one of the best bull runs ever, even though the economy remains extremely weak, thanks to record stimulus and hopes over a vaccine.\u201d\n&gt; \nTo best sum it all up, here are 10 charts that tell the picture of 2020 so far.\n\n&gt; 1.) The 2010s were the first decade in history to go all 10 years without a recession, which of course ended just months into the new decade, as the economy stopped. Stocks gained 13.5% on an annual basis last decade, surprisingly, only the third-best decade over the past four.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 2.) This is an election year, and the S&amp;P 500 Index hasn\u2019t been lower when a President is up for reelection since FDR in 1940. Although this seemed nearly impossible at the March lows, it is looking like this incredible streak could have a chance in 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 3.) One of the first signs something could go wrong in 2020 was stocks fell in January. Historically, this has meant potential trouble for the final 11 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 4.) As fears over COVID-19 gripped the world, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its fastest bear market ever, in only 19 days. To put this in perspective, this was the fastest bear market in the 124-year history of the Dow.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 5.) Mark Twain said \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes\u201d. Looking at history, every 50 years there has been a terrible pandemic and stocks fell more than 30%. We don\u2019t know if the ultimate lows are in this time, but so far, history is rhyming.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 6.) More than 20 million people in the US lost their jobs in April, while the unemployment rate soared to near 15%, the highest since the Great Depression. Record drops in manufacturing, industrial production, retail sales, and consumer spending have all taken place in the past two months as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 7.) A recession is here, ending the streak of 128 months in a row without one. What is unique about the previous expansion was nominal gross domestic product (GDP) grew only 50%, about the average growth seen during the previous expansions, but this expansion was nearly twice as long as the average expansion (10 years versus 5 years).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 8.) The bounce off of the March 23 S&amp;P 500 lows has been historic in many ways. In fact, it was one of the best 20-day rallies ever, with previous best rallies seeing strong returns 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 9.) As scary as it was on the way down, stocks have come roaring back, gaining more than 35% from the March 23 lows. This would classify as the greatest bear market bounce ever, which opens the question: is this more than a bear market bounce and instead the start of a new bull market?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 10.) The number of COVID-19 tests in the US nearly doubled in May versus what was seen in April. Additionally, fewer and fewer tests are coming back positive. Testing is one of the key ways we will beat this and this is a step in the right direction. We\u2019ve also seen new monthly lows in people on ventilators, in the ICU, and in hospitals.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Hard to believe, but there are still 7 months left in 2020. It hasn\u2019t been easy for any of us, and we continue to keep everyone impacted by this pandemic in mind, but we continue to see the glass as half full. The dual benefit of record monetary and fiscal policy should help create a bridge to help those most impacted, while the economy can slowly come back online later this year.\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$ADBE** \n&gt; * **$CHWY** \n&gt; * **$TIF** \n&gt; * **$LULU** \n&gt; * **$COUP** \n&gt; * **$SFIX** \n&gt; * **$LOVE** \n&gt; * **$NEPT** \n&gt; * **$GHM** \n&gt; * **$REVG** \n&gt; * **$GME** \n&gt; * **$HDS** \n&gt; * **$FIVE** \n&gt; * **$SIG** \n&gt; * **$CASY** \n&gt; * **$CVGW** \n&gt; * **$AMC** \n&gt; * **$FCEL** \n&gt; * **$QTNT** \n&gt; * **$PLCE** \n&gt; * **$CHS** \n&gt; * **$THO** \n&gt; * **$GCO** \n&gt; * **$BF.B** \n&gt; * **$LMNR** \n&gt; * **$WSG** \n&gt; * **$PRTY** \n&gt; * **$GES** \n&gt; * **$BBCP** \n&gt; * **$CONN** \n&gt; * **$HEXO** \n&gt; * **$PHR** \n&gt; * **$PVH** \n&gt; * **$RRGB** \n&gt; * **$PLAY** \n&gt; * **$TNP** \n&gt; * **$JW.A** \n&gt; * **$SB** \n&gt; * **$GSM** \n&gt; * **$SRT**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/bgPdMCr.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.8.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/d2EW1kr.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uxSiJJr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.9.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3SIjcG7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cRBrPlt.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.10.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DaheXAm.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9mcHxTl.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.11.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/i8SNjWM.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9xcBZPK.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.12.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Inc. $392.90\n&gt; **Adobe Inc.

        "selftext": "[I just thought you guys would appreciate this kind of idiocy.](https://i.imgur.com/DqpygmN.jpg)\n\nMicroVision is in the middle of M&amp;A - their micro projection technology is being used in Microsoft\u2019s HoloLens2. The company is most likely being bought out by Microsoft, but it\u2019s possible another company like Amazon or Tesla could buy them. MicroVision sent Ford a HUD projection system prototype in the very early 2000s. Who knows what will happen. The stock has been crunched between .94 and 1.07 for several trading sessions. If you watch Level 2 closely you will see they are suppressing the share price while supporting it at $1. I know this sort of situation doesn\u2019t necessarily attract options traders, but the opportunity here for an accumulation and hold play is strong. There was a fake Seeking Alpha article that claimed MVIS was under investigation by the SEC. There\u2019s a lot of manipulation happening and that really makes me want to buy even more shares. (I\u2019m buying 100K shares SHIP Monday in case there\u2019s a gap so I can actually buy more shares of MVIS) Just recently, a new addition to the MicroVision board was announced: [Dr. Mark B. Spitzer](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microvision-announces-addition-dr-mark-123010583.html)\n\n\u201cDr. Spitzer is an experienced technology innovator with expertise in eyewear- and head-mounted systems, micro-displays, imaging optics for AR and VR, and photovoltaics. He has a strong record of inventive entrepreneurship with 70 issued US patents, over 86 publications and leadership positions with ground-breaking technology companies. His experience in technology development and management includes serving as Principal Scientist at Kopin Corporation in the early 1990s where he led DARPA-funded development of micro-displays for military head-mounted systems. In 1996 Dr. Spitzer founded the MicroOptical Corporation (eventually renamed Myvu), where as CEO he launched several industrial and consumer eyewear-based AR products.  In 2012 Dr. Spitzer joined Google X as Director of Operations for Glass, and later moved to the VR team at Google where he helped build expertise in VR hardware design. He retired in 2017.\u201d\n\nAlso VISL would be a good call. They had a satellite appear on screen in action at NASA on the Space X broadcast.",

        "selftext": "I'm a numbers kinda guy, and lately I've been looking at what are some of the trends before a penny stock becomes the next insane momentum runner. To be honest, darkpool data is typically the one that shows up a lot. Biotech pennies (for instance) have large darkpool prints before a major hype. For instance, if you do have access, look at the PTI Darkpools before the last data catalyst. You can distinctly see that darkpool prints happened before the hype and then distinctly dropped a bit before the data release. Once these hedgefunds take positions, then they a) field their pumpers and eventually it becomes a self-fulfilled prophecy or b) the hype naturally becomes known to retail because of news articles etc or c) both. \n\nOne of the stocks that has consistently been coming up on the top 20 stocks on darkpools is HEXO, and recently, it just registered one of its highest DPIs (darkpool indicator). Generally, the higher the DPI, the more bullish the hedgefunds are feeling towards a particular stock. DPIs are great indicators for upcoming momentum (for instance, for the past two days, MU, RTX and JPM have had the highest DPIs across the entire stock market, and thus I wasn't surprised much today to see that these stocks made monstrous moves). On the other hand, the registry of low DPIs often indicates that a rally on a stock may be dying a bit. Tesla registered one of the lowest DPIs yesterday so I wasn't watching it today. As it happened, it didn't really make much of a move. While DPIs are not an end all be all, they're a great tool for finding some of the stocks that so-called smart money is pouring money into (or taking money out of). \n\nNow, let's be honest here: this is pennyland and there are stocktwits pumpers that are propping stocks up. There are some massive pumpers on HEXO (primarily mrinvestorpro, who basically manipulates the market). It's noticeable to see that the large prints on darkpools started as mrinvestorpro started pumping HEXO. Is Mrinvestorpro just a paid promoter for a bunch of sleazy hedgefunds? Most likely yes. With that said, will the stock run up a lot? Absolutely. I think everyone here knows that pennies are pumps and dumps and here it seems like HEXO is about to experience the next pump.",

It seems to have limited use for a limited number of patients.  While the stock was heartily rewarded when it was first discussed, hitting $86, it closed the day $75.16 -2.67 (3.43%).  Also a disappointment were the results from PFE on their breast cancer drug, Ibrance, announced after the close on Friday, and after several price targets were lowered, it finished the day $35.46 -2.73 (7.15%).\n \nOn Thursday, the HOMERUN OF THE DAY was ARCA Biopharma: ABIO with a novel approach for COVID-19 treatment.  It is testing their \u201cselective inhibitor of tissue factor.\u201d  It has already completed phase 1 and 2 and if results continue, they are confident that they will file an NDA in the third quarter.  The stock was as high as $22.00 before closing $19.21 +15.26 (386.33%) but since has had no follow up press and has come back to earth finishing the day $9.20 -3.40 (26.8%).  The main reason for the drop was an offering of $9.4million stock offering at $9.00.\n \n \nFOOD SUPPLY: was MIXED with TSN +1.26, BGS +1.22, FLO -.01, CAG -.07, MDLZ +.13, KHC -.05, CALM -.31, JJSF +2.48, SAFM -4.70, LANC +.65, GO -.49, HRL +.02 and PBJ $31.79 + .10 (.32%).\n \nBIOPHARMA was LOWER with BIIB -5.64, ABBV -1.02, REGN -13.34, ISRG -5.44, GILD -2.67, MYL +.53, TEVA +.56 (4.47%), VRTX -1.32, BHC +.68, INCY -.16, ICPT +1.24, LABU +.74, and IBB $134.00 -.74 (.66%).\n \nCANNABIS: This group was HIGHER with TLRY +.23, CGC -.90, CRON +.07, GWPH +2.07, ACB -.01, PYX unch., NBEV -.01, CURLF -.15, KERN +.43, and MJ $13.87 +.11 (.80%).\n\n \nDEFENSE: was LOWER with LMT + .52, GD +.57, TXT +.58, NOC -4.53, BWXT -.63, TDY -8.98, RTX -.32 and ITA $166.27 +1.72 (1.05%).\n \n \nRETAIL was HIGHER with M +.01, JWN +.57, KSS +1.48, DDS -.86, WMT -.29, TGT -2.83, TJX +.57, RL +1.20, UAA +.51, LULU +8.90, TPR +.59, CPRI +1.76 and XRT $41.10 +.30 (.74%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were HIGHER with GOOGL +1.98, AMZN +26.23, AAPL +3.46, FB +6.91, NFLX +5.48, NVDA -3.22, TSLA +61.00, BABA -1.09, BIDU +.60, CMG +41.96, CAT +.37, BA +5.49, DIS +1.20, and XLK 97.95 -.02 (.02%).\n \n \nFINANCIALS were HIGHER with GS +3.06, JPM +1.02, BAC +.45, MS +.40, C +1.42, PNC +.63, AIG +.69, TRV +2.24, AXP +1.43, V -1.24, and XLF $23.63 +.22 (.94%).\n \n \nOIL, $35.44 -.05. Oil has managed to trade $35.90 today but has run into the 100-day MA and a top at $36.35 back on 3/11.  I will be on watch to get back into the USO puts for a move back to $30-31.00.  The stocks were higher and XLE was $39.35 +.59 (1.52%).\n \n \nMETALS, GOLD: $1,750.30 -1.40. After trading 1761 overnight the gold traded down to 1737 and managed to come all the way back to close basically unchanged, The action in the US$ is projecting higher prices for the metals. We bought back 2 lots of NEM roughly $6.00 lower that our sale last week and even when gold was lower today NEM was higher.\n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $9,443 -7 After breaking down from just over 10,000 and trading as low as 8630 last Tuesday we have been clawing our way back toward 10,000.  Today\u2019s close was one of the smallest net changes I\u2019ve seen in quite a while.  This continues to look higher.  We added 350 shares of GBTC last Wednesday @ $10.02 to our position of 400 @ $8.06, bringing our average price to $8.97. GBTC closed $11.25 +.35 today.\n \n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",
