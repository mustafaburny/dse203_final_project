        "selftext": "[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bitcoin-just-touched-a-record-market-value-exceeding-its-2017-top-11605643255](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bitcoin-just-touched-a-record-market-value-exceeding-its-2017-top-11605643255)\n\nThe world\u2019s most prominent digital currency on Tuesday is back to carving out records just like it was 2017. The No. 1 crypto\u2019s nearly 8% weekly rise and 30% gain so far in November has helped the asset hit a market value of around $328 billion, according to digital-currency data site CoinMarketCap.\n\nThat level surpasses the roughly $322.7 billion value that bitcoin hit on Dec. 17 when its price was nearly $20,000 (see chart).\n\nAlthough bitcoin\u2019s price [**BTCUSD,** **5.03%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/cryptocurrency/BTCUSD?mod=MW_story_quote) [**BTCUSD,** **5.03%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/cryptocurrency/BTCUSD?mod=MW_story_quote) hasn\u2019t exceeded that 2017 record level, it currently sits about 12% shy of touching a round-number milestone at $20,000. It quietly has been drawing more attention and notching a fresh all-time peak for an asset considered one of the most polarizing of this generation of financial markets.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s record market capitalization reflects the attention that the blockchain-based asset has garnered over its rivals.\n\nSo-called bitcoin dominance, or the share of bitcoin\u2019s value as it contributes to the universe of recognized digital currencies, was at 65.7%, as tracked by CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin\u2019s market-cap dominance is near to its highest level since May of 2020.\n\nBitcoin and other cryptos were boosted last month after PayPal Holdings Inc.\u00a0 [**PYPL,** **+0.18%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/PYPL?mod=MW_story_quote) \u00a0 said it would\u00a0allow customers to buy cryptocurrency through their accounts and\u00a0[use it for merchant payments](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/paypal-will-let-customers-buy-cryptocurrencies-and-use-them-for-online-payments-11603283352).\n\nBitcoin prices have gained nearly 150% so far this year, with Bitcoin futures [**BTC.1,** **4.26%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/BTC.1?mod=MW_story_quote) trading on the CME Group seeing a similar rise. By comparison, gold [**GCZ20,** **-0.39%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/GCZ20?mod=MW_story_quote) has gained 24% in the year to date, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average [**DJIA,** **-0.55%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/DJIA?mod=MW_story_quote) has climbed 4.7% so far in 2020. The S&amp;P 500 index [**SPX,** **-0.47%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/SPX?mod=MW_story_quote) has gained more than 12% and the technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index [**COMP,** **-0.21%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/COMP?mod=MW_story_quote) has surged more than 33% over the same period.\n\nStill, bitcoin bears and detractors aren\u2019t hard to find. On Tuesday, Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world\u2019s largest hedge fund, and a longtime bitcoin skeptic, on Twitter challenged proponents of the currency to explain to him why bitcoin is worth his attention and not [doomed to collapse](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/dalio-says-he-might-be-missing-something-about-bitcoin-challenges-twitter-to-change-his-mind-11605637663).",

        "selftext": "Gather round my fellow gamblers and shit posters, I have a story and a proposition for you all.\n\nSeveral weeks ago **I had the bright idea to YOLO my entire account in Palantir**. \n\nWhen PLTR was down and out, myself and a few otherwise guys were balls to the wall in long positions. We all loved the company, but quite frankly, things were looking pretty bleak. While we knew the company should be worth more than the measly $9 it was at, the market price told us otherwise.\n\nI was rather worried about what I had done. YOLOing my entire account into Palantir on IPO day drove me to post **a sad story about I had fucked up thousands and thousands of dollars of gains**, which I later deleted out of embarrassment. You can find the remnants of that story here:  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j3xaua/once\\_upon\\_a\\_time\\_in\\_2020/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j3xaua/once_upon_a_time_in_2020/)\n\nThe only thing that remains is some top comments of people calling me a retarded degenerate.\n\nI held on to my sweet sweet palantir, and as any good redditor would, I continued preaching the gospel of Thiel and Karp in any case.\n\nin one WSB conversation, I was lamenting about how I needed money from Palantir in order to pay for the PS5 I had already pre-ordered. This was a very serious concern, because I had paid Walmart, and subsequently saw my Palantir position lose several thousand dollars. Wasn't quite sure how I would explain this one to the Mrs.\n\nA classic millennial problem indeed.\n\nThen along came a random internet stranger named u/ZanderPerk. He promised me that he **would buy me a PS5 if PLTR hit $20 by end of the year**, which at the time, seemed like an outlandish price. You can find that comment here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jj8apo/last\\_chance\\_for\\_early\\_bird\\_pricing\\_pltr/gagx94u/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jj8apo/last_chance_for_early_bird_pricing_pltr/gagx94u/?context=3)\n\nA few weeks later, our sweet sweet hivemind started heating up, and I reminded the internet of what was promised:  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jpbtx9/pltr\\_looking\\_forward\\_to\\_my\\_free\\_ps5/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jpbtx9/pltr_looking_forward_to_my_free_ps5/)\n\nZanderperk, being the gentleman that he is, assured me that **he would live up to his end of the bargain**: [https://i.imgur.com/8lM0j4D.png](https://i.imgur.com/8lM0j4D.png)\n\nSo in anticipation of this glorious transaction, I did what anyone in my position would, and ordered a custom bumper sticker in Zander's honour: [https://i.imgur.com/4d2yhA2.png](https://i.imgur.com/4d2yhA2.png)\n\nThis baby will be slapped right on top the console, and forever live beside my 55 inch 4k TV.\n\nNow it seems that reddit has caught wind of this tale, and people are calling on Zander to send me the money. I have asked him for his email address so that I can send him a PayPal money request, to the tune of $499 USD. You can see further discussion here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jzjzlg/pltr\\_just\\_won\\_this\\_man\\_a\\_playstation\\_5/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jzjzlg/pltr_just_won_this_man_a_playstation_5/)\n\n# Now here is my promise to pay it forward.\n\n# Since PLTR has indeed hit $20 before the end of the year, I will do the exact same thing for someone else *IF* Zander pays up AND it hits $30 before the end of the year.\n\nIf Zander sends me the money, I will post pictures of the PS5 and sticker in WSB for you all to see, and I will update this post with a link to that post. (The sticker doesn't arrive until \\~Dec 7th.)\n\n***Then*** if PLTR crosses $30.00 before the end of Dec 31 2021, I will set up a quick lottery system to give out another PS5 using some clever technology that will be determined at a later date. (I already have an idea in mind.)\n\nIn order to enter the draw, people must be able to prove that they are still in an active stock holding or long option position. The position must be started or purchased before the end of the day tomorrow (November 24th). Bears can fuck off.\n\nThe winner will be ordered a PS5 disc edition off of Amazon, Walmart or Bestbuy straight to an address of their choice. Winner must reside in a country that receives deliveries from one of these stores.\n\n*CHECK BACK HERE FOR UPDATES.*",

        "selftext": "December and January aren't typically busy months for initial public stock offerings, but this time around, they'll be an exception. Almost a half dozen well-known tech startups, each already valued privately at over $1 billion, have recently filed for IPOs, including Airbnb, DoorDash, and Roblox.\n\nThey're hoping to take advantage of strong investor appetite for tech stocks, despite the pandemic, and to catch the coat tails of other tech companies that have recently made [successful debuts](https://fortune.com/2020/08/29/2020-ipos-palantir-tech-ipo-asana-snowflake-predictions/). Shares in cloud database company Snowflake are up 129% since its September IPO and those of data mining company Palantir are up 215% since its September listing.\n\nHere are key details to consider in weighing whether to invest in the latest batch of would-be public tech companies. Financial data is from the first nine months of 2020 unless otherwise indicated.\n\n## Affirm\n\nSymbol: AFRM  \nFiscal 2020 revenue: $510 million (fiscal year ended June 30)  \nRevenue growth: 93%  \nGross margin: n/a  \nNet loss: $113 million\n\n[Affirm\u2019s S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1820953/000110465920126927/tm2026663-4_s1.htm)\n\nFounded in 2012 by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, Affirm aims to [bring credit and lending to customers of all kinds of online retailers](https://fortune.com/2020/02/05/credit-cards-levchin-affirm-ceo-daily/). Those hard-to-miss layaway offers for a pair of shoes from Cole Haan or that cute coffee table on West Elm\u2019s website? Affirm works behind the scenes to process the loans and often covers the cost of the item (in some cases, partner banks fund the loans). So far, Affirm has signed up over 6,500 retailer and helped consumers pay for almost $11 billion worth of products over the past three years.\n\n**Pros**: Affirm says its \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d system is superior to credit cards, with no hidden fees or high interest rates (most Affirm offers are zero interest rate). Like other hot consumer companies, Affirm also touts its net promoter score of 78, suggesting more than three-quarters of customers would recommend the company.\u00a0 As e-commerce grows, there\u2019s plenty of room for growth in the market\u2014less than 1% of e-commerce transactions in North America relied on \u201cbuy now pay later\u201d deals. And Affirm says its data analysis of consumers\u2019 ability to pay lets it avoid major losses.\n\n**Cons**: The largest e-commerce sites, like [Amazon](https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/) and [Walmart](https://fortune.com/company/walmart/), have no need for Affirm and could even launch their own lending services. So could big banks or other financial institutions that can borrow money more cheaply than Affirm can. And more than one-quarter of all of Affirm\u2019s lending has so far come from customers of a single retail partner: Peloton.\n\n## Airbnb\n\nSymbol: ABNB  \nFirst nine months of 2020 revenue: $2.52 billion  \nRevenue growth: -32%  \nGross margin: 74%  \nNet loss: $697 million\n\n[Airbnb\u2019s S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520294801/d81668ds1.htm)\n\nAs the now-famous story goes, Airbnb co-founders Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia decided to rent some airbeds in their San Francisco apartment after a big design conference caused local hotels to be fully booked. Their little web site, AirBedandBreakfast.com, eventually grew into the titan that has rented space to 825 million customers cumulatively across 220 countries.\n\n**Pros**: The fast-growing startup took a huge hit when COVID-19 curbed travel, but has since [almost bounced back](https://fortune.com/2020/06/30/airbnbceo-brian-chesky-bookings-rentals-recovery-2020-ipo-coronavirus-pandemic/). Bookings were down 72% in April compared to the same month in 2019, but for June through September, the declined narrowed to 19% to 23%. The company also brags in its regulatory filing that pandemic-related spending cuts, including slashing headcount by 25%, make it more efficient going forward.\n\n**Cons**: The pandemic showed that the travel industry is subject to sharp downturns that cut into Airbnb\u2019s sales, and infections are on the rise again worldwide. The company has also battled restrictive rules in many cities and countries seeking to ban short-term rentals. Airbnb's filing disclosed it\u2019s also in a battle with the Internal Revenue Service that could cost it $1.4 billion if it loses. And even after being in business for more than a decade, Airbnb is still on pace to lose around $1 billion this year.\n\n## DoorDash\n\nSymbol: DASH  \nFirst nine months of 2020 revenue: $1.92 billion  \nRevenue growth: 226%  \nGross margin: 53%  \nNet loss: $149 million\n\n[DoorDash S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000119312520292381/d752207ds1.htm)\n\nAfter moving to the U.S. as a child, DoorDash co-founder and CEO Tony Xu worked as a dishwasher in a Chinese restaurant to help make ends meet. The point of DoorDash, he says, is to help strivers and small businesses thrive. Now in business for seven years, DoorDash \u201cdashers\u201d deliver food and other items from almost 400,000 businesses to 18 million consumers per month as of September.\n\n**Pros**: DoorDash is the leading provider of delivery with over twice the market share of runner up Uber Eats as of October 2020. The pandemic has [ignited much faster growth](https://fortune.com/2020/05/25/coronavirus-jobs-food-delivery-doordash/) in food delivery as people avoid going out to eat. Some smaller players have already sold out (DoorDash bought Square\u2019s Caviar service for $410 million last year), but further consolidation could let DoorDash charge more for its services.\n\n**Cons**: Once the pandemic passes, many DoorDash customers [may return to eating](https://fortune.com/2020/11/16/can-doordash-maintain-its-pandemic-boost/) in restaurants. Although California voters approved a measure to continue to classify gig workers like DoorDash\u2019s dashers as independent contractors, other governments still are trying to classify gig workers as employees, which could wreck DoorDash\u2019s business model.\n\n## Roblox\n\nSymbol: RBLX  \nFirst nine months of 2020 revenue: $589 million  \nRevenue growth: 68%  \nGross margin: 74%  \nNet loss: $206 million\n\n[Roblox S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm)\n\nMuch more than a video game, Roblox has become a virtual environment for millions of people and companies [to create their own games](https://fortune.com/2019/07/16/roblox-100-million-monthly-active-users/). Co-founders David Baszucki and Erik Cassel went from making software simulations for physics labs to creating Roblox in 2004. Now some 31 million people play daily, including three-quarters of all U.S. kids age 9 to 12, the company says (Research firm Dubit put the figure at [half of kids 9 to 12 this summer)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/16/technology/roblox-tweens-videogame-coronavirus.html).\n\n**Pros**: Roblox has plenty of reasons for developers to stick around, including its large devoted customer base and the Lua scripting language that makes it easier to make new games. About two-thirds of current users are from the U.S. and Canada, so there is room for considerable overseas expansion.\n\n**Cons**: The pandemic super-charged Roblox growth rate, but kids may decide to put their screens down and play more outside after the crisis ends. Many users play on devices running [Apple](https://fortune.com/company/apple/) or [Google](https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/) software, putting Roblox somewhat at the mercy of the twin tech titans\u2019 app policies. Other games have been banned and the app stores decide how much of each sale they are entitled to. A joint venture with Tencent to bring Roblox to China could be impacted by increasing trade tensions or new restrictions. And gaming and social media platforms come and go depending on the latest fads. Roblox could be the MySpace of gaming.\n\n## Wish (ContextLogic)\n\nSymbol: WISH  \nFirst nine months of 2020 revenue: $1.75 billion  \nRevenue growth: 32%  \nGross margin: 65%  \nNet loss: $176 million\n\n[Wish S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1822250/000119312520298630/d82777ds1.htm)\n\nOvershadowed by better known rivals like Amazon, [Alibaba](https://fortune.com/company/alibaba-group-holding/), and [eBay](https://fortune.com/company/ebay/), Wish [focuses its e-commerce services](https://fortune.com/2020/11/20/online-marketplace-wish-files-for-ipo/) on the \u201caffordable\u201d segment of consumers. Founded in 2010, Wish now helps more then 500,000 online sellers hawk goods to 100 million monthly active shoppers. Parent company ContextLogic has its name on the IPO registration filing.\n\n**Pros**: Shopping online isn\u2019t just for the wealthy. Wish says it's targeting the 44% of U.S. consumers and 85% of Europeans who have household incomes of $75,000 or less, plus shoppers in developing countries. Wish\u2019s platform is mobile first, and 90% of purchases happen via its mobile app. Although Wish doesn't make a profit, it generated free cash flow (or cash from operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment) of $23 million in the first nine months of 2020.\n\n**Cons**: Wish faces off against many larger rivals, such as Amazon, Alibaba and eBay, plus Shopify and Walmart. To compete against the giants, Wish spends vast sums, over $1 billion so far in 2020, on marketing. With deep connections in China, U.S.-based Wish could be hurt by worsening trade tensions. And as with other startups dependent on mobile apps, Google and Apple could undermine Wish\u2019s business with new rules or requirements.\n\n[Source](https://fortune.com/2020/11/25/2020-ipos-airbnb-roblox-affirm-wish-doordash-predictions-going-public/)",

Although California voters approved a measure to continue to classify gig workers like DoorDash\u2019s dashers as independent contractors, other governments still are trying to classify gig workers as employees, which could wreck DoorDash\u2019s business model.\n\n## Roblox\n\nSymbol: RBLX  \nFirst nine months of 2020 revenue: $589 million  \nRevenue growth: 68%  \nGross margin: 74%  \nNet loss: $206 million\n\n[Roblox S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm)\n\nMuch more than a video game, Roblox has become a virtual environment for millions of people and companies [to create their own games](https://fortune.com/2019/07/16/roblox-100-million-monthly-active-users/). Co-founders David Baszucki and Erik Cassel went from making software simulations for physics labs to creating Roblox in 2004. Now some 31 million people play daily, including three-quarters of all U.S. kids age 9 to 12, the company says (Research firm Dubit put the figure at [half of kids 9 to 12 this summer)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/16/technology/roblox-tweens-videogame-coronavirus.html).\n\n**Pros**: Roblox has plenty of reasons for developers to stick around, including its large devoted customer base and the Lua scripting language that makes it easier to make new games. About two-thirds of current users are from the U.S. and Canada, so there is room for considerable overseas expansion.\n\n**Cons**: The pandemic super-charged Roblox growth rate, but kids may decide to put their screens down and play more outside after the crisis ends. Many users play on devices running [Apple](https://fortune.com/company/apple/) or [Google](https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/) software, putting Roblox somewhat at the mercy of the twin tech titans\u2019 app policies. Other games have been banned and the app stores decide how much of each sale they are entitled to. A joint venture with Tencent to bring Roblox to China could be impacted by increasing trade tensions or new restrictions. And gaming and social media platforms come and go depending on the latest fads. Roblox could be the MySpace of gaming.\n\n## Wish (ContextLogic)\n\nSymbol: WISH  \nFirst nine months of 2020 revenue: $1.75 billion  \nRevenue growth: 32%  \nGross margin: 65%  \nNet loss: $176 million\n\n[Wish S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1822250/000119312520298630/d82777ds1.htm)\n\nOvershadowed by better known rivals like Amazon, [Alibaba](https://fortune.com/company/alibaba-group-holding/), and [eBay](https://fortune.com/company/ebay/), Wish [focuses its e-commerce services](https://fortune.com/2020/11/20/online-marketplace-wish-files-for-ipo/) on the \u201caffordable\u201d segment of consumers. Founded in 2010, Wish now helps more then 500,000 online sellers hawk goods to 100 million monthly active shoppers. Parent company ContextLogic has its name on the IPO registration filing.\n\n**Pros**: Shopping online isn\u2019t just for the wealthy. Wish says it's targeting the 44% of U.S. consumers and 85% of Europeans who have household incomes of $75,000 or less, plus shoppers in developing countries. Wish\u2019s platform is mobile first, and 90% of purchases happen via its mobile app. Although Wish doesn't make a profit, it generated free cash flow (or cash from operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment) of $23 million in the first nine months of 2020.\n\n**Cons**: Wish faces off against many larger rivals, such as Amazon, Alibaba and eBay, plus Shopify and Walmart. To compete against the giants, Wish spends vast sums, over $1 billion so far in 2020, on marketing. With deep connections in China, U.S.-based Wish could be hurt by worsening trade tensions. And as with other startups dependent on mobile apps, Google and Apple could undermine Wish\u2019s business with new rules or requirements.\n\n[https://fortune.com/2020/11/25/2020-ipos-airbnb-roblox-affirm-wish-doordash-predictions-going-public/](https://fortune.com/2020/11/25/2020-ipos-airbnb-roblox-affirm-wish-doordash-predictions-going-public/)",

Word is going to spread fast and all those energy companies talk to one another. And despite what all you environmentalist cucks think, oil is still one of the most important industries in the world, and will continue to be for quite some time.\n* Their business is showing 90% of their revenue comes from pre-existing clients, which means that once they dig their claws in, companies integrate the software into their organizations and it becomes reoccurring income. That means all the new growth they are talking about is a gold mine.\n* And finally, have presented several opportunities to profit while helping fight COVID, which means this stock is safe in the event that the pandemic worsens.\n\nUnlike most of the headless bears who are squealing like a bunch of chickens, I actually read the full earnings report and listened to the investor call.\n\nEvery single big shot analyst who had a chance to ask a question started off by first saying \"congratulations on your really solid first quarter\".\n\nWhile the highly uneducated and emotional reddit bears are scared**, the big money is impressed.**\n\nAnd consider this, because these guys did a direct listing instead of an IPO, big money hasn't had a chance to get a chunk of the pie yet and at this rate, I am sure they will very soon.\n\nOnce the big cheeses start adding positions, this stock is going to pop off.\n\nTomorrow might be red, I don't care. Because next year will be GREEN GREEN GREEN.\n\nBut guess what, at the time of this posting, the stock is actually green in the after hours trading, which is fucking hilarious.\n\nIf this stock trades green tomorrow after a lack luster EPS beat, that is actually going to be incredibly bullish. That will mean this stock is rallying on fundamental confidence, not a bajillion robin hood retards pumping and dumping.\n\nAnd here is my final argument: do you really think a pentagon-funded, AI and data analytics company that was cofounded by Thiel - a business leader with ties to Facebook, SpaceX, PayPal and the Bilderberg Group - is going to do anything but make absolute fucking bank for the next decade? \n\nI am holding and holding and holding. \n\nI encourage you to join me.\n\n\\---\n\n*My positions: lots of shares at $9.05, $9.80. $10.73 and $11.70.*",

        "selftext": " **People have sent me few privates asking for references/proof:**\n\n**Here is CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT by United States district court Southern district of New York, which goes into much detail about the topic:**\n\n[https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Bitcoin.pdf](https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Bitcoin.pdf)\n\nHi community!\n\nThose who do not know, before the Madoff ponzi collapsed, B. Madoff was chairman of Nasdaq and very well respected among the circles. Few years later, Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) trustee estimated actual losses to investors of $18 billion. It is reason why i am posting this as hopefully i will save few people from losing their money in the coming years by investing into cryptocurrencies.\n\nI will keep it short and simple and not go much into technical details, but i assure you anyone willing to google, there is plenty of detailed proof and research into the topic.\n\nBitcoin price has increased through this year **mainly** only because the fact that there is a mechanism in which dollar \"equivalent\", called tether, which is almost entirely unpacked by fiat (unofficial claim by tether treasury is, that they are packed by dollar equivalent, which in this case means bitcoin itself, which is ridiculous in itself), is being used to prop up the price of bitcoin by buying it off all the major exchanges, such as Binance, Huobi, Coinbase, Kraken etc. There is hardly any real retail interest and all the major counter points, used by the crypto community (such as insitutional demand, billionaires buying before you, Paypal, Square, Micro etc) is all smoke and mirrors, in hopes that retail will come and buy into the ponzi pyramid.\n\nWhy i mentioned Madoff, is because just few days back, total tether in circulation also crossed the SIPC mentioned $18B, currently already at $18.4B. This year alone so called Tether Treasury has issued &gt;14B new tethers, claiming exponential increase in demand. As a comparison, at the peak of the 2017 crypto mania, there were only total of 1.4B printed through whole year. And tether is only one of the quite a few noteworthy other stablecoins, which i wont go into currently, but they also feed into the loop/system, of proping up the price. Simple example being DEFI, where Ethereum is being used as an collateral, for person to take out a loan in so called stable coins, which then on majority of cases, is used again to purchase even more ethereum. In Laymans terms, being used as a simple leverage multiplier tool with interest payment. But is defined by community, as somewhat of a groundbreaking new invention. Which i agree, it somewhat would be, if used for the real world purposes, not as a simple leverage tool.\n\nHere is a chart i put together, which should make it rather obvious for anyone taking a quick look.\n\nIt includes last 4 years of bitcoin price, tether printing and retail interest on one chart:\n\n[**https://imgur.com/i78BTXg**](https://imgur.com/i78BTXg)\n\nI will also leave you with a comic strip, that i had made, which describes the last 4 years of Bitcoin (and cryptocurrency asset class) tether addiction:\n\n[**https://imgur.com/fPDm2VX**](https://imgur.com/fPDm2VX)\n\nPS *I just want to add, that in my opinion, main issue with bitcoin and all of cryptocurrency space is more precisely what it has become, a big ponzi pyramid. On top of that, tether treasury (and those involved) has completely taken over the space and what they are doing, will eventually leave many people financially ruined (because they do not any better or know, but still are willing to risk) and unfortunately them probably much more rich.*\n\n*I must add, that i would be significantly more acceptable with this global huge economy project/test, if it would lead its way in natural course, without middleman mafia, which currently, in Laymans terms, pumps the price with nothing but air, to eventually sell to a greater fool. If it would naturally succeed, as in new age gold 2.0, more gradually, actually being implemented into payment/financial systems etc, actually represent the alternative to government money, money for people, i would be alot more comfortable to let it run its course and see if it perhaps succeeds.*\n\n*Bitcoin has lost all of what it was supposed to represent and where it was supposed to develop as a technology. There are many reasons why it has gone as such, it is not really topic to discuss here.*",

        "selftext": "Hi community!\n\nThose who do not know, before the Madoff ponzi collapsed, B. Madoff was chairman of Nasdaq and very well respected among the circles. Few years later, Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) trustee estimated actual losses to investors of $18 billion. It is reason why i am posting this as hopefully i will save few people from losing their money in the coming years by investing into cryptocurrencies.\n\nI will keep it short and simple and not go much into technical details, but i assure you anyone willing to google, there is plenty of detailed proof and research into the topic.\n\nBitcoin price has increased through this year **mainly** only because the fact that there is a mechanism in which dollar \"equivalent\", called tether, which is almost entirely unpacked by fiat (unofficial claim by tether treasury is, that they are packed by dollar equivalent, which  in this case means bitcoin itself, which is ridiculous in itself), is being used to prop up the price of bitcoin by buying it off all the major exchanges, such as Binance, Huobi, Coinbase, Kraken etc. There is hardly any real retail interest and all the major counter points, used by the crypto community (such as insitutional demand, billionaires buying before you, Paypal, Square, Micro etc) is all smoke and mirrors, in hopes that retail will come and buy into the ponzi pyramid.\n\nWhy i mentioned Madoff, is because just few days back, total tether in circulation also crossed the SIPC mentioned $18B, currently already at $18.4B. This year alone so called Tether Treasury has issued &gt;14B new tethers, claiming exponential increase in demand. As a comparison, at the peak of the 2017 crypto mania, there were only total of 1.4B printed through whole year. And tether is only one of the quite a few noteworthy other stablecoins, which i wont go into currently, but they also feed into the loop/system, of proping up the price. Simple example being DEFI, where Ethereum is being used as an collateral, for person to take out a loan in so called stable coins, which then on majority of cases, is used again to purchase even more ethereum. In Laymans terms, being used as a simple leverage multiplier tool with interest payment. But is defined by community, as somewhat of a groundbreaking new invention. Which i agree, it somewhat would be, if used for the real world purposes, not as a simple leverage tool.  \n\nHere is a chart i put together, which should make it rather obvious for anyone taking a quick look. \n\nIt includes last 4 years of bitcoin price, tether printing and retail interest on one chart:\n\n [**https://imgur.com/i78BTXg**](https://imgur.com/i78BTXg) \n\nI will also leave you with a comic strip, that i had made, which describes the last 4 years of Bitcoin (and cryptocurrency asset class) tether addiction:\n\n[**https://imgur.com/fPDm2VX**](https://imgur.com/fPDm2VX)\n\nPS *I just want to add, that in my opinion, main issue with bitcoin and all of cryptocurrency space is more precisely what it has become, a big ponzi pyramid. On top of that, tether treasury (and those involved) has completely taken over the space and what they are doing, will eventually leave many people financially ruined (because they do not any better or know, but still are willing to risk) and unfortunately them probably much more rich.* \n\n*I must add, that i would be significantly more acceptable with this global huge economy project/test, if it would lead its way in natural course, without middleman mafia, which currently, in Laymans terms, pumps the price with nothing but air, to eventually sell to a greater fool. If it would naturally succeed, as in new age gold 2.0, more gradually, actually being implemented into payment/financial systems etc, actually represent the alternative to government money, money for people, i would be alot more comfortable to let it run its course and see if it perhaps succeeds.*\n\n*Bitcoin has lost all of what it was supposed to represent and where it was supposed to develop as a technology. There are many reasons why it has gone as such, it is not really topic to discuss here.*",

        "selftext": "One consistency between all the investing/options/WSB subs right now is that anything non-PLTR related seems to be getting drowned out. However there is some promising short term opportunity out there in case you're uneasy with managing your FOMO of jumping into a company that has run +70% over the last week.\n\nYou may be sick of hearing about SPACs in 2020, but do try to keep an open mind in that they are not all created equally. There are some fantastic companies coming down the SPAC pipeline now and in the future.\n\nI've recently traded SBE, DPHC (now RIDE), SPAQ (now FSR), KCAC (now QS) with a mixture of shares and options and have done extremely well. In fact, r/options has been the source of my finding out about many of these great companies ahead of time. The trick with them is getting it while they are cheap, riding the hype to merger and selling off before it begins to cool.\n\nRight now I believe there are some very promising opportunities out there today that have still not had a significant run up (SBE being the exception). I encourage you to do your own DD on each of these companies before adding them to your portfolio:\n\n**Short Term Plays:**\n\n* **HCAC** \\- Soon to be Canoo, an LA based Electric Vehicle company. This SPAC has been left behind in the EV run-ups as of late and has a lot of upside. It's also one of the few EV companies generating revenues.   \nAs of this writing it is trading around $13.00 AH, with a floor set around $10. The current business combination date for this is by December 31st (assuming no extension will be filed).   \n\\-I've taken a heavy shares and options position on this, with ITM calls expiring in Feb and May. This company has not had the same level of coverage that Lordstown and Fisker have so it may take time after the merger to begin building momentum.\n* **GMHI** \\- Soon to be Luminar, a Lidar technology company that will be used for autonomous driving in vehicles. While not strictly an EV play, there is still an association. Backed by Peter Thiel (co-founder of PayPal, and more recently, Palantir).   \nThe vote for the combination is scheduled for December 1st. Assuming the vote approves the merger, I would expect a pop on the 2nd which may continue to rise over the following days.   \n\\-I've taken a short term options position on this with ITM/ATM calls expiring December 18th.\n\n**Medium/Long Term Plays:**\n\n* **NOVS -** One word: AgTech. If you're unfamiliar it stands for Sustainable Agricultural Technology, and it is very likely to be a term we hear ad nauseam over the course of the next decade. One company in particular is positioning itself as a leader and is working to turn the Appalachian region into the hub of this industry; AppHarvest.   \nAgain, I highly recommend you look the company up and do your own DD but I am absolutely in love with them. The only problem is that I don't necessarily see this one popping in the same vain of EV's at merger. This will be a slow burn, but once institutional investors understand that this is in fact a tech company it will be a good long term play.   \n\\-I have taken a share only position and intend to hold, with a partial sell off/profit take strategy around $50 per share.\n* **PSTH -**  Bill Ackman's baby. A SPAC curated with the intention of taking a private \"Unicorn\" public. I won't even begin to speculate on which companies they are courting as it is truly a source of contention between shareholders but names like Bloomberg, Stripe, and Menards have been dropped. The floor on this SPAC is set at a $20 buy back should the company pick a company that is not agreeable to shareholders.  \n\\-I'm extremely heavy in shares, and it currently makes up 30% of my portfolio. I would hold off on options as it could still be another year before a deal is announced, but you could always take a position in long dated LEAPS. \n\n**Tread with Caution:**\n\n* **SBE -** I love ChargePoint. They are positioning themselves to be the Electric Charging Station infrastructure for a growing EV world. Their TAM is huge, and will grow tenfold in the next few years. I have no doubt this will be a great stock to own. The only problem is given their recent run up, I'm not sure how much more they will move once the merger takes place. If you sold HYLN after the merger you did great. If you didn't, well, you're now potentially a long term bag holder. Similar may be true about SBE, but given that their main competitor BLNK has only a small comparative penetration of the market they have a very impressive moat for growth.  \n\\-I've taken a large share position, however I will begin to sell off as begins to kiss $50 or shortly after the merger.  \n\n\nAnyways, the point of this post was to offer encouragement and alternatives to anyone who may be unsure of what moves to make in a world dominated by NIO and PLTR meme stock hype. SPACs are by no means a sure thing, but 2020 has proven to be good to them and I will continue taking advantage of the ones where I am buying in to companies I believe in long term (even if I am only a short term position holder).\n\nYou have not missed out. Every trading day is an opportunity. Good luck!",

        "selftext": " So Friday we saw the stock market down again as the dow fell almost 0,6% percent while the s&amp;p fell over 1% and the nasdaq was crushed being down almost 2and a half percent as This last week we saw the dow fell 6,5% the s&amp;p 5,6% and the nasdaq 5,5% as all 3 ended the month of october down more than 2,3%\n\nOne good thing for the US economy is that the retail stores sales has recovered and consumers are still spending excess cash especially with the holidays and black Friday up next. I believe that as much as Tuesday is important for the economy, the events that will come later in the week as the FED holds two important meatings and the latest jobs report comes in at the end of the week far outweight that\n\nAs you can see the New York Federal bank economic index is still rising, that sugests a V-Shaped recovery is continuing in the US. This index takes into consideration lots of important data from the economy.\n\nThe unemployment in the US has been decling but that rate has sharply slowed down in the last months as it\u2019s still more than double the 3,5% at the start of the year as the latest number from September was almost 8% rate of unemployment.\n\nAs you can see the most affected people are still the middle and low wage under 60k/year. As the high wage jobs unemployment rate is barely down 0,5% since January.\n\nSo the fear in the stock market saw a huge pop in the last week as the VIX (the volatility index) rose from 27,55 more than 10 points to close at over 38 this last week. This next week is probably the last with such high volatility as the upcoming big events will pass and more certainty will be in front of us . The volatility was so high as we retested the June highs and have seen a pullback 3 times after hiting those levels.\n\nDespite strong earnings last week from all big tech companies (Alphabet,Amazon,Apple, facebook and Microsoft) the companies stocks dropped amid the broader stock market sell-off with the exception of Google which posted terrific numbers to crush analysts expectation.\n\nApple is down almost 19% since the highs of September and has lost 450 billion dollars in market cap since then.\n\nThis dropped in the company has been caused by a broader stock market sell off as well as missed iphone revenues. I do believe that iphone revenues will see a huge spike in the next coming quarters as apple customers as myself will finally upgrade from older iphone to this next generation iphone which is the first to have 5G technology as well as other great improvements in capability as well as camera.\n\nA couple analysts have recently changed they\u2019re target to between 132-140 which is over 20$ from where it sit\u2019s today. That is quite good upside for the company.\n\nAs you can see they are barely down 2,7% year over year in product revenue despite not having the new iphone launch included in this financials, and overall the company still saw a 1% increase in revenue due to the huge spike in services revenue that I believe will continue especially with the Apple One bundle just being launched at the end of last week. The Total Gross margin also increase slightly but I expect this to be just a small drawback in the short-term.\n\nAlso I believe that Amazon was dragged down because of the next quarter predictions of huge costs while they only forecasted a operating income of 1 to 4 point 5 billion dollars which is below what was anticipated despite amazon web services continuing to be the largest player in cloud spending. With a 32% share of total market and a revenue of 11,6 billion dollars which Is up 29% year over year, while Azure from Microsoft comes in second and google cloud in third. There is still a lot of room to grow for all of this companies as there is still over 37% of the market provided by other companies. Also this is a great company to own for the long term as digitazation and online commerce will continue to grow, some are estimating that by 2030 amazon could have annual revenues of 1 trillion dollars $ while using conservative projections of compound annual growth for e-commerce of 10%, for the cloud services of 15% and for ad revenue of 20%, amazon could hit that mark by then. But I believe this is possible even faster than that.\n\nFacebook is the one company that I will have to analyze more in this group. They will be hit with privacy issues do to the regulatory risk and Apple\u2019s announced privacy changes. But I still do believe this to be a great company as they also own Instagram, and I really like how that part of the company is innovating and growing.\n\nWhile google seems to be back on track as the company was the laggard in the group. They have become less reliant on the search ad revenue as growth in Youtube ads and Google cloud will push the company to renewed growth in the future.\n\nAlibaba will see two big events this week as they will kick off the singles day event next week, extending the event with 3 more days rather than the usual 24-hour event, in which they will also double the products on offer. Also another big event will be the IPO of ant Group in which Alibaba will still have a big stake. I believe they are a great company the forward revenue growth estimates of 31% are higher than other tech companies like amazon, google and Microsoft while the P/E for the company is the most attractive of the group also.\n\nFord just announced that late next year they will introduce a lower priced competitor for Tesla AutoPilot and GM\u2019s super cruise, this is great news for the company as they seem to be improving the company continuasly.\n\nSome important earnings coming this week are :\n\nPaypal on Monday, which I believe is the greatest fin-tech company, on\n\nWednesday Qualcomm will announce that will be a great insight to see what Apple\u2019s iphone 12 is doing as Qualcomm is the biggest supplier for apple and on Thursday Alibaba (with ant group ipo) coming also on the same day this stock could see a surge in value.",

        "selftext": "For those of you who enjoyed my post on why the WSB is moving markets, see below. \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k0ctkd/why\\_wsb\\_is\\_now\\_running\\_the\\_entire\\_equity\\_market/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k0ctkd/why_wsb_is_now_running_the_entire_equity_market/)\n\nNow Let me tell you a story about Palantir and why it is so important. \n\nSee, back in 1998, there were two internet payments company who were trying to make it big, one run by Peter Thiel and one run by Elon Musk. They eventually merged and created paypal. You can see the two of them here in the same picture. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3ie03xvwgg161.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9368996a40228d96dae30a8d14c9a7b22d446a8\n\nSo why is paypal important. Well the Paypal mafia is known for building basically the entire post dot-com tech landscape that you know today. Yelp, youtube, square, linkedin, tesla/space X. And who is Peter Thiel, well, he is basically the smartest venture capitalist in the world and very well known in Silicon Valley. He was the first outside investor in facebook, he backed Tesla and SpaceX. \n\nSo why does this matter? Well, Peter Thiel is one of the smartest men in the world. He was Chess grandmaster in his youth and he has a brilliant, contrarian mind. He foresaw the rise of SJW in the late 90s, this man either can predict the future or he is a time traveler. Either way, he is a savant. \n\nNow on to Palantir \n\nSo why does this matter for Palantir. Peter founded Palantir in 2003. That was 17 years ago. What was his plan? Well, I think his plan is to create the next IBM. So hear me out. Well, historically the development of internet technology swung between enterprise and consumer. Prior to 2000, nobody in Silicon valley knew anything about consumer internet, everyone was busy chasing HP contracts or trying grab a DOD tender. But it swung to consumer for the next 20 years. He is making a calculating bet that consumer is played out and the next swing will be in the form of enteprise/government sales. \n\nAnd who was the big boss of enterprise/gov sales. Well it was IBM. See IBM didn't giant in computing that dominated from 1940-1980s, it started off selling office tools like punch cards and typewritters. They didn't have the best technology, but they had a big rolodex of government and corporate clients. When the computing revolution came around in the 1950s, it wasn't the best technology that won, but the one with the customer distribution. \n\nThe same thing is happening with Palantir, they are doing manpower intensive work for governments and large corporates now, its not really a high margin scalable business (which is why wallstreet poo-hoos the stocks). But the thing is, they are positioned perfectly for the rise of AI. Much as the same way IBM was well positioned for the rise of computing. \n\nAnd that is why, PLTR will hit $500/share by 2030",

        "selftext": "Visa stock has made investors more than 1,000% over the past decade -- peppy for an organization that dates back to the Eisenhower administration. But here comes a gaggle of app-based hopefuls eyeing not just the toll roads that make credit cards work, but also the $2 trillion in worldwide revenues collected for payments of all kinds.\n\nYou know about PayPal (ticker: PYPL) and maybe Square (SQ) and Venmo. How about Remitly, Stripe, Circle, and Bolt? There are dozens more with Seussian names. To skip out on a dinner check with under-30s, just mock the encryption protocol of their favorite fintech platform, and tell them you'll froop them ticklecoins.\n\nI spoke this past week with Visa (V) chief Al Kelly about the competitive landscape in payments. That's a sensitive subject now, because Visa is trying to buy a company called Plaid, which serves as a data go-between for banks and apps. For example, Venmo uses Plaid. This month, the Department of Justice sued to block the deal, alleging that it would deprive consumers of a potential alternative to Visa. Kelly calls the deal pro-consumer and says Visa will fight the suit vigorously. \"We feel very, very good about that,\" he says.\n\nVisa was spawned from the first true credit card -- the paper, $300-limit BankAmericard, launched in 1958. Bank of America kept the credit business but licensed the financial plumbing for cards to other banks. This eventually became Visa, and a rival system launched in 1966 became Mastercard (MC). Today, Visa links 70 million sellers with 3.5 billion account credentials issued by 13,000 banks. It collects fees per transaction for authorization, clearing, and settlement, and it sells add-on services for things like detecting fraud and increasing customer loyalty.\n\nThis year, I've come to view paying in cash and receiving change as the financial equivalent of shaking hands during a bilateral sneeze. Giving over a credit card for swiping, or sliding my own and pawing a number pad, is more like an elbow bump -- better, but do we really have to? Tap-to-pay is the norm in most of the world, but not the U.S. -- yet. Kelly says it will be common here soon. If past patterns from other markets repeat, tap-to-pay will bring a big jump in the percentage of U.S. transactions done with cards.\n\nCard adoption is already climbing -- to 82.1% of in-store transactions from 78.7% in January, according to industry researcher The NPD Group. But opportunities for spending have shriveled. So, during Visa's fiscal year ended in September, revenues decreased 5%, to $21.8 billion, and earnings per share fell 7%, to $5.04. Visa is larger than Mastercard and is particularly dominant in debit cards, but Mastercard has been growing faster, especially in Europe. Both have been smaller for years than China's UnionPay.\n\nAnalysts call these networks card rails, and the bank-controlled Automated Clearing House, or ACH, system for money transfers, bank rails. Many upstart players operate as digital wallets that depend in part on card or bank rails, or else use cryptocurrency. Kelly says the payments industry is filled with \"frenemies.\" For example, PayPal, the best-known digital wallet for online purchases, used to steer customers to cheaper ACH rather than Visa cards. Now, under a partnership, Visa gets equal footing with ACH, and PayPal makes inroads at stores using Visa's contactless mobile-payment technology.\n\nStocks in general trade at elevated valuations now, and growth stocks especially. Even so, Visa's price of 38 times this fiscal year's estimated earnings suggests that investors feel confident about its future role in payments, and its return to speedy growth. This fiscal year, earnings-per-share growth is pegged at just 9%, as the pandemic continues and then hopefully lifts. Early estimates for next year's growth put it at 24%. Beyond the tap-to-pay rollout and spending rebound, Visa is hoping to win over push transactions that use bank rails -- like tuition, rent, and wages. Banks will have a say, but they make good money on card businesses, and ACH is a nonprofit.\n\nChina is a wild card. Visa doesn't have a license to operate there domestically, so it partners with local players like AliPay to create new uses for travelers' Visa cards. But phase one of the trade deal between China and the Trump administration is supposed to open China to foreign payment companies like Visa. We'll see. For now, Kelly calls cash his biggest competitor. I'm Purelling just thinking about all that market share up for grabs.\n\nThe stock market is said to be driven by the battle between greed and fear. Right now, it looks more like hope and stupidity. The vaccine results announced this past week by Pfizer (PFE) are the best hope yet that the pandemic's end is in sight. That vaccine and perhaps others could receive emergency-use authorization within the next two months, and much of America could receive needle pokes in the first half of next year. Life could look normal by Thanksgiving 2021.\n\nBut the virus is raging like never before. We've turned simple advice -- keep a bit of distance or wear masks -- into a culture war. And Washington is distracted. That President Donald Trump is denying clear election results is folly. That an overwhelming majority of his party's senators won't speak up is dangerous. If it doesn't damage our democracy, it could kill us by the tens of thousands this winter from inaction on the virus. And it could cripple our economy again.\n\n\"Sell the vaccine,\" wrote Bank of America in an investment strategy note on Friday. It means to reduce holdings of risky assets ahead of what could be a difficult stretch before the economy reopens in earnest. Like Goldman Sachs, BofA is recommending a barbell strategy, with cyclicals on one side, but not distressed ones, and the sort of virus-immune tech stocks that have been flourishing all along on the other.\n\nI know; I dipped too far into politics there for a moment. Media bias, a few will say, and they're right. I don't endorse politicians or parties, but secretly, I'm in the tank for science and representative democracy.\n\n**Source: Barron's Article**",

Without Stonks to trade today I need something to get hard over.\n\nThen I realized that \ud83c\udd71\ufe0fitc\u2b55\ufe0fin is traded 24/7. I thought \ud83c\udd71\ufe0fitc\u2b55\ufe0fin was a fad after it crashed 90% a couple years ago. But after digging online, that crash was expected. \ud83c\udd71\ufe0fitc\u2b55\ufe0fin follows a 4 year boom-bust cycle. This is basically guaranteed.\n\nIn 2013 it made a ~32x return run from $30 to $1153 before plummeting 85%\nIn 2017 it made a ~16x return run from that previous $1153 high to a new $20k high before plummeting 85%\n\nSee a pattern here? So according to history in 2021 it will make a ~8x return from $20k to $160k\n\nI\u2019m not making these numbers up. Everyone knows this. Every hedge fund is snatching up \ud83c\udd71\ufe0fitc\u2b55\ufe0fin. Your favorite companies are too (papa Elon\u2019s PayPal bought 100% of newly mined \ud83c\udd71\ufe0fitc\u2b55\ufe0fin supply).\n\nI know you guys don\u2019t like buying normal stocks and shares so you guys don\u2019t want to just buy a \ud83c\udd71\ufe0fitc\u2b55\ufe0fin. Y\u2019all want some \ud83c\udd71\ufe0fitc\u2b55\ufe0fin options; too bad they don\u2019t exist. Idk Go liquidate your 401k which is holding boomer SP500 funds and mutual funds and dump it all into \ud83c\udd71\ufe0fitc\u2b55\ufe0fin.\n\nTLDR: buy \ud83c\udd71\ufe0fitc\u2b55\ufe0fin at $16k rn for a bargain after its being sold off. $160k+ by 2021 or when this bull run ends.\n\nEdit: why the fuck are mods banning C Ry P T 0.

        "selftext": "Sup stonkF@GS its ya boy aMereMortal and I heard you all like eating crayons so I decided to actually use them to draw pretty (r3tard3d) lines on stock charts before you shove them in your nose and mouth. Yes stocks are random, but from time to fucking time they bounce off zones of supply and demand also known as support and resistance you fucks. I've stopped going full autismo lately and have been mixing up my calls with some theta shit and guess what now my trading account is almost back to break-even after being down 20 G's in April.\n\nHere are the moves for the week. Purple lines indicate a channel the stock trades in, blue lines are the same color as your balls and represent hard lines of support, aka where the dip buyers come in to steal your shares after you've panic sold them like a little bitch. Typically when a stock goes outside the purple lines it reverts back to the mean at some point. The further it goes outside the channel, the faster it \\*might\\* get back inside the channel. This is well represented in the first chart below.\n\n**DOCU**  \n\n\nDOCU is one of the top covid plays and with shutdowns and bullshit coming full force, I like this stock right here. Not only that, but if any of you morons ever move out of your mom's basement and sign important documents, you will notice many agencies actually use this service. DOCU has dropped 20 fucking percent in one week and is trading at the bottom of the channel which leads me to believe this is a buy at these levels.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1qj10cx1gpw51.png?width=1944&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a06a51695220687d1094b1012f803f0b4c928878\n\n**JD**\n\nNext up we have JD.com which is like the SHOPIFY for China, except its better than shopify. If you've been following China and their GDP numbers you will see that they are on track to have the fastest recovery from covid. I don't give a fuck if the numbers are fake and the recovery is fake, they will need to pump fake earnings across the board to make it seem like everything is going well anyways. This stock right here is trading directly in the center of my imaginary purple lines which mean stonks might go up or down, but with earnings right around the corner you can bet your pet hamster this thing will be trading in the $90's soon.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m47w3qzwgpw51.png?width=1940&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=edf0a9d1d6cd1f721290ed87fd6b4004bba6caf4\n\n**CRM**\n\nCRM, also known as Salesforce, is a monster of a stock. The company is having explosive growth, and it's not because of covid but because they have a high quality lead-generation product that almost every profitable business wants to use. We are trading at the very bottom of this channel and are almost back to the price of last earnings report. I like this setup because I see maybe a 10% downside, but I also see infinity upside. That's what I call a win-win situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/97mo9i4nhpw51.png?width=1946&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25d07e70e8343b1faf04b6955514881a6ed624c4\n\n**PYPL earnings YOLO**\n\nLastly, lets look at Paypal. This company has been scamming users for fee's since before you were even born... but guess what. If we look at Shopify's earnings report we will see that e-commerce is absolutely fucking booming. Right now there are only 2-3 payment methods that have a monopoly on online purchases. It's either your wife's boyfriend's credit card, stripe, or fucking paypal. Shopify sales booming, amazon sales booming, all around e-commerce is booming, and paypal will reap benefits until the growth begins to slow... we can thank this virus for breathing life into this shit-stronk. This ticker is also trading right at the bottom of the range due to this massive decline we just saw last week. Lots of buying opportunities came about, but too bad you all only had 15 cents left in your account.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/esw4h790ipw51.png?width=1942&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a996d52c0eb89604573f84ec936783e24bdc47b4\n\nThanks for listening to my TED talk.

        "selftext": "I was in Costco today just getting a few things and I ended up talking to some random guy. He first asked me, \"hey, why are you in that wheelchair?\" - I look pretty healthy despite being in one. So I told him I recently had prostate surgery done. They replaced my prostate and sphincter with some device that helps me go poop because the cancer got to it earlier this year. Thankfully after beating covid in the hospital they cleared a spot for me to have a surgery done before this \"second wave\" hit. Anyway, he probably thought I was autistic (I am) when we started talking about stocks and options. \n\nI've been super interested in options trading for a while but never really understood what it was. He broke it down for me in like ten minutes and told me to check out reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets. So I walked away to get a few more things and left Costco then came straight here. The guy understood my situation and said people would be willing to help me out.\n\nSo what I need help with is the starting money to trade these options. I need $15,000. My medical bills from the prostate surgery and cancer have bankrupted me completely but I've still been having to take my HIV/AIDS medication which, if you know, can be quite expensive. Not to mention the fact that I had a stroke induced seizure late last year. Generally I'm not in good health because I broke my back as a teenager and it caused me to have this painful needle-like sensation for fifteen years until a few years ago when I got rehab for it. The rehab strengthened my back and took care of the pain but they must have not been  good at their jobs because I tore my ACL in a soccer match just a few weeks later. \n\nBeing autistic with HIV/AIDS, a brand new technological sphincter/prostate, a fucked up back, a debilitating stroke AND Parkinson's is just really tough but I don't want to give up. When they diagnosed me with Down's Syndrome a few years I go I was about ready to give up but as you can see I'm still here. My heart is StIlL BeAtInG and I'm not about to call it quits on options trading even though I've called it quits on heroin speedballs mixed with Adderall just a couple months after my depression kicked in when the lockdowns began.\n\nSo if you're interested in being a part of my success story, DM me and I'll give you my PayPal or Venmo so I can make an inspiring story that people can and will share to /r/progresspics. Thanks! Have a blessed day. Stay safe!",

        "selftext": "Bitcoin has recently attracted substantial investments from a couple of companies like MicroStrategy (420 million USD) and Square (50 million), as well as a few large individual investors like Tim Draper (500 million), Paul Tudor Jones, and Ricardo Salinas (unnown amounts).  Some companies like Greyscale, PayPal, and Fidelity, while not investing in Bitcoin itself, have created services and derivative products that aim to obtain revenue from Bitcoin investors.  \n\nThese large players have justified their choice with the claim that Bitcoin is a good hedge investment because its market price is uncorrelated with the real economy or with the price of other traditional hedges, such as gold, real estate, or T-bonds; and its value is somehow likely to increase, even while those assets lose their because of the pandemic.  \n\nThis claim has some rational justification, since Bitcoin's does not have any significant interaction with the real economy or a \"fundamental\" value derived from expected dividends, and is therefore not affected by business closures, unemployment, or a possible hyper-devaluation of the dollar.\n\nYet Bitcoin was not designed to be an investment instrument, much less a hedge against general economic crisis.  Its future is threatened by several structural flaws, such as its huge energy consumption (6 gigawatts, like that of the entire Detroit metropolitan area) and its association with criminal activities.  \n\nThus I call the attention of the readers of this subreddit to [SuCoAsMa](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~stolfi/bitcoin/sucoasma/prospectus.pdf), a new alternative hedge asset that was designed from the ground up to for that very purpose.  It adopts the key features of Bitcoin's business model, that fully insulates it from the vagaries of the real economy, while eliminating its fatal flaws.   \n\nIt is possible that some old school financial experts who actually bother to read its Prospectus may not be favorably impressed.  However, as explained in that document, this new asset  has even better revenue potential for brokers and marketplace operators, if properly exploited.  As shown by the success of Fidelity's Bitcoin-based Digital Investments  subsidiary, even a manure-class investment instrument can become a gold mine if wrapped into a derivative product or service with a highly respected and prestigious brand in its name.",

        "selftext": "**People have sent me few privates asking for references/proof:**\n\n**Here is CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT by United States district court Southern district of New York, which goes into much detail about the topic:**\n\n[https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Bitcoin.pdf](https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Bitcoin.pdf)\n\nHi community!\n\nThose who do not know, before the Madoff ponzi collapsed, B. Madoff was chairman of Nasdaq and very well respected among the circles. Few years later, Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) trustee estimated actual losses to investors of $18 billion. It is reason why i am posting this as hopefully i will save few people from losing their money in the coming years by investing into cryptocurrencies.\n\nI will keep it short and simple and not go much into technical details, but i assure you anyone willing to google, there is plenty of detailed proof and research into the topic.\n\nBitcoin price has increased through this year **mainly** only because the fact that there is a mechanism in which dollar \"equivalent\", called tether, which is almost entirely unpacked by fiat (unofficial claim by tether treasury is, that they are packed by dollar equivalent, which in this case means bitcoin itself, which is ridiculous in itself), is being used to prop up the price of bitcoin by buying it off all the major exchanges, such as Binance, Huobi, Coinbase, Kraken etc. There is hardly any real retail interest and all the major counter points, used by the crypto community (such as insitutional demand, billionaires buying before you, Paypal, Square, Micro etc) is all smoke and mirrors, in hopes that retail will come and buy into the ponzi pyramid.\n\nWhy i mentioned Madoff, is because just few days back, total tether in circulation also crossed the SIPC mentioned $18B, currently already at $18.4B. This year alone so called Tether Treasury has issued &gt;14B new tethers, claiming exponential increase in demand. As a comparison, at the peak of the 2017 crypto mania, there were only total of 1.4B printed through whole year. And tether is only one of the quite a few noteworthy other stablecoins, which i wont go into currently, but they also feed into the loop/system, of proping up the price. Simple example being DEFI, where Ethereum is being used as an collateral, for person to take out a loan in so called stable coins, which then on majority of cases, is used again to purchase even more ethereum. In Laymans terms, being used as a simple leverage multiplier tool with interest payment. But is defined by community, as somewhat of a groundbreaking new invention. Which i agree, it somewhat would be, if used for the real world purposes, not as a simple leverage tool.\n\nHere is a chart i put together, which should make it rather obvious for anyone taking a quick look.\n\nIt includes last 4 years of bitcoin price, tether printing and retail interest on one chart:\n\n[**https://imgur.com/i78BTXg**](https://imgur.com/i78BTXg)\n\nI will also leave you with a comic strip, that i had made, which describes the last 4 years of Bitcoin (and cryptocurrency asset class) tether addiction:\n\n[**https://imgur.com/fPDm2VX**](https://imgur.com/fPDm2VX)\n\nPS *I just want to add, that in my opinion, main issue with bitcoin and all of cryptocurrency space is more precisely what it has become, a big ponzi pyramid. On top of that, tether treasury (and those involved) has completely taken over the space and what they are doing, will eventually leave many people financially ruined (because they do not any better or know, but still are willing to risk) and unfortunately them probably much more rich.*\n\n*I must add, that i would be significantly more acceptable with this global huge economy project/test, if it would lead its way in natural course, without middleman mafia, which currently, in Laymans terms, pumps the price with nothing but air, to eventually sell to a greater fool. If it would naturally succeed, as in new age gold 2.0, more gradually, actually being implemented into payment/financial systems etc, actually represent the alternative to government money, money for people, i would be alot more comfortable to let it run its course and see if it perhaps succeeds.*\n\n*Bitcoin has lost all of what it was supposed to represent and where it was supposed to develop as a technology. There are many reasons why it has gone as such, it is not really topic to discuss here.*",

I know their is a good volume of Bullion and Coins that move through the site not to mention Motor vehicles is an easy revenue stream for them.   \n\n\nI also question what \"Adult only\" video games will be.

In the three months ending Sept. 30, revenue grew 98% year over year, while net losses fell by roughly half to $15.3 million.\n\n&gt;Even if they don\u2019t charge interest, Affirm earns a fee when they help a merchant make a sale. On the consumer side, they earn interest income on loans they buy from bank partners. Affirm also earns interest on some consumer loans. The rate they charge varies by consumers\u2019 creditworthiness, but often starts at 0%.\n\n&gt;Affirm said gross merchandise volume -- a key metric in the payments industry -- grew by 77% year over year. It has more than 6.5 million customers. Roughly 64% of loans on Affirm this year were taken out by repeat consumers.\n\n&gt;The company plans to offer two classes of stock, an increasingly common practice among Silicon Valley start-ups.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, November 2, 2020**\n\nStocks opened today\u2019s session higher before paring some gains ahead of an extremely busy week, with market participants closely monitoring the results of the US presidential election, a meeting of the Federal Reserve, and the October jobs report, and rising coronavirus numbers in the US and Europe.\n\nAfter an extremely choppy day, the Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 0.22% up, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 1.11% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) performed the best, finishing 1.56% up.\n\nOn Tuesday is the US presidential election between incumbent Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden. Needless to say, given the political divide, the coronavirus pandemic, and social unrest that exists in the United States right now, the outcome of this election will be extremely significant. According to a study done by Edward Jones, since 1932, the stock market has dipped 64% percent of the time the day after a presidential election. This likely reflects anxiety about the future if a large cohort of the population is unhappy with the election result. Regardless of the election result,  it's likely a large section of the population will be unhappy. Moreover, given the surge of early and mail-in ballots due to the pandemic, the possibility exists that the outcome may not be clear after Tuesday. This scenario would certainly cause a massive spike in volatility and uncertainty in the markets. According to the US Elections Project at the University of Florida, as of Friday of last week, around 85 million individuals have cast their ballots, over half of the total turnout in 2016. If this pace picks up, this election could have the highest voter participation rate in over 100 years.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, the election will have a number of consequences for Corporate America. For example, a change in the political control in either the Senate or the White House (which are Republican-controlled right now) could potentially alter corporate tax rates, increase or decrease regulation in some industries, affect trade relations with other countries, and changes in capital gains tax, which is important for market participants. Moreover, the outcome of the election will likely influence the timing and size of much-needed additional fiscal stimulus \n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is set to hold the first of its two-day rate-setting meeting the day after Election Day, with the twelve FOMC meeting Wednesday and monetary policy statement and press conference from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday. Going off previous meetings, the Fed is virtually guaranteed to keep interest rates, near zero. After their last meeting in September, the Fed signaled that it would maintain interest rates are current levels until \u201cat least 2023\u201d. Throughout these meetings, FOMC members, including Powell, have increasingly escalated their calls for further fiscal stimulus to complement the Fed\u2019s monetary support. In early October, Powell said, \u201ctoo little support would lead to a weak recovery, creating unnecessary hardships for households and businesses.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, the Department of Labor is set to release the October job report, a crucial piece of data to understand the state of the labor market and gauge the pace of recovery. According to Bloomberg consensus data, non-farm payrolls are expected to increase by around 600,000. While this estimate would the sixth month of net payroll gains, it would also be the four, straight month of deceleration, indicating the pace of recovery is slowing. The unemployment rate is also predicted to tick lower, from 7.9% to 7.6%. However, worryingly, there appears to be a trend towards long-term unemployment for many Americans. The number of individuals filing continuing claims, people filing for unemployment benefits who have already filed an initial claim, has continued to increase the past several weeks. This means that people who lost their job due to the pandemic are having an increasing harder time finding new employment quickly.\n\nThe US just set a new record for the highest seven-day average of daily new cases: 81,336 as of Sunday. That's the first time the number has ever topped 80,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. new cases are far exceeding new testing. Over the past week, new cases have increased 18%, according to Johns Hopkins. But the number of new tests performed has increased only 4.29%, according to the Covid Tracking Project. \n\nLast week, Europe recorded around 1.5 million new cases of coronavirus, a new record, according to data from Johns Hopkins. Trends are worrying across the continent now, including in countries such as Greece and the Czech Republic, where infection rates had been low until recently. Measures are tightening up everywhere. England, in response to the surge, announced a nationwide lockdown for at least the next four weeks.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Apple (AAPL) announced on Monday an event for Nov. 10 where it\u2019s expected to announce new Macs that are powered by their own chips powered by ARM processors, instead of the Intel chips it had been using. Could impact Nvidia (NVDA) stock, which owns ARM chips, and Intel, who has not been doing very well lately, judging from last earnings report and stock price action (INTC).\n* Images for the updated Tesla Cybertruck could come next Musk, according to CEO Elon Musk.\n* Chinese electric vehicle maker NIO announced its October deliveries, and the number has shares on the move, again. NIO delivered 5,055 vehicles in October, doubling from a year ago. The result is doubly impressive because NIO very recently raised its manufacturing capacity to 5,000 vehicles a month. The company is selling all the cars it can make. This stock is an absolute monster and is one we love at PsychoTrader!\n* Alibaba (BABA), is doubling its Singles\u2019 Day offerings this year, running the massive online sales event across two periods rather than one. Alibaba says it expanded the shopping window for Singles\u2019 Day to provide more relief for merchants that have been hit hard by the pandemic. Single\u2019s day is a counter to Valentine\u2019s Day that celebrates being single. Normally it\u2019s held on Nov 11. This is the world\u2019s largest shopping festival. According to Fortune Magazine, BABA shipped $38.4 billion in gross merchandise value on Singles\u2019 Day last year. Amazon\u2019s Prime Day, by comparison, sold around $6 billion in goods last year.\n* Asian shares were mostly higher on Monday buoyed by further signs of recovery in China's manufacturing sector.

        "selftext": "**In this post I am going to share my experience as I start a new portfolio from 0$ and keep adding funds to it every month as I try to grow it as fast as possible**\n\nHey everyone Happy Thanksgiving and Welcome! So, I have deposited and invested in the stock market all the money I managed to save up in the last month as I deposited 3500$ in my eToro portfolio on the 12th of November and I am already up more than 7% in just two weeks. \n\nAs my portfolio has constantly outperform the big 3 indexes the Nasdaq100, the SP500 and the Dow Jones 30 almost every day since starting my portfolio. Here is a comparison of my portfolio vs the indexes since starting as I am up over 7%. [Portfolio v Index](https://ibb.co/pRnQLQf)\n\nSo i wondered? Is it really bad to own more stocks? Is less &gt; more? What is your opinion on this subject? I believe that it is way better to be invested in more companies and to add and grow your position in time as you also see how the companies evolve and you can also do some price averaging.\n\nSo here is my current portfolio composition as I split all my money equally to start, I will go into very few little details about everyone so I don\u2019t make this a 2 hour read time.\n\nI will start now by going alphabetically and not in the most important order as the first company that I own is BYD which is a rival company for both Tesla and NIO in the EV market as they focus on cars, new energy solutions and electronics. They are also developing a lot of commercial EV like buses, coaches and taxis which will be a great addressable market for them as they are not rivaled in those segments at the moment. The company has gone up a lot in value this year as you can see in this graph and have a Forward P/E of more than 100 but I believe this company will greatly expand its sales and be one of the leaders in the segment especially in China which is the biggest EV market.

The company also has an impressive yield of almost 2% [https://ibb.co/xjYVMx4](https://ibb.co/xjYVMx4) / [https://ibb.co/q9hjp48](https://ibb.co/q9hjp48)\n\nI also bought NetFlix as I believe them, Disney and Roku will be some of the largest players in the streaming business as traditional TV and cinema are a dying business at the moment.The company is trading at a premium but this is due to them dumping money in high quality content to grow they\u2019re subscriber base while they also have steadily increase subscriptions cost in the last years. I believe they will do better next quarter and will see a re-test of all time highs. [https://ibb.co/VN2TF6f](https://ibb.co/VN2TF6f) / [https://ibb.co/B6j9zTn](https://ibb.co/B6j9zTn)\n\nI also own NIO more as a spec play to be well diversified in the EV world, I believe this is a long term investment as the stock price has gone up like bananas recently, the company will have to have perfect growth in the next couple of years to justify an increase in value as they are still losing money. [https://ibb.co/MZ2NL4v](https://ibb.co/MZ2NL4v) / [https://ibb.co/mt8f3ZR](https://ibb.co/mt8f3ZR)\n\nNike is my favorite apparel play as I believe it is the most desired my a lot of people and keeps expanding. I really like how the company is managed and I believe in them for the long-run. [https://ibb.co/jw1zjgj](https://ibb.co/jw1zjgj) / [https://ibb.co/RYR4QSP](https://ibb.co/RYR4QSP)\n\nNvidia is my favorite play in the semiconductor sector as they will continue to benefit from more and more personal pc sales as well as huge data center demand especially for they\u2019re super performing products. They trade at a huge premium right now but I believe they can become the next trillion dollar company in the tech sector. [https://ibb.co/kgJS0w1](https://ibb.co/kgJS0w1) / [https://ibb.co/k8D1MSL](https://ibb.co/k8D1MSL)\n\nI also like owning Pepsico alongside Coca Cola as they are the two biggest players in the sector and I believe that they will both benefit a lot in the next years from the economy recovery. With pepsico offering a 2,7% dividend and a great growth path I really like owning this stock [https://ibb.co/2SY4xPY](https://ibb.co/2SY4xPY) / [https://ibb.co/Sdt2hGC](https://ibb.co/Sdt2hGC)\n\nPinterest is an up and coming social media platform that has a great ad friendly setup and could see growth in the next years. They are trading at insane PE ratios but that should catch up to the company in the future and I believe you must own it to be well diversified. [https://ibb.co/gwGFbyb](https://ibb.co/gwGFbyb) / [https://ibb.co/5TYz4KS](https://ibb.co/5TYz4KS)\n\nPalantir is a highly controversial name right now but its products and services are really good as they are earning more and more stamps of approval with government contracts while also expanding to commercial use. Financial info is not that good as the company barely reported they\u2019re first earnings after the IPO. [https://ibb.co/fdQ42gc](https://ibb.co/fdQ42gc) / [https://ibb.co/wyTJSG2](https://ibb.co/wyTJSG2)\n\nPayPal is another great company that will do very well in the future as payments transition to a more digital approach and the company is transitioning to allow cryptocurrencies as well which will attract even more users. They have had a greet increase in revenue and eps in the last quarters and I expect that to continue to grow. [https://ibb.co/9tXxhJZ](https://ibb.co/9tXxhJZ) / [https://ibb.co/M5vCynn](https://ibb.co/M5vCynn)\n\nQualcomm is my favorite 5G play alongside apple as this will be a long cycle of upgrades for the communications services that will benefit them a lot.They are trading at an PE of over 30 but have great revenue and EPS growth while also offering an almost 2% dividend yield. [https://ibb.co/NFsnKqW](https://ibb.co/NFsnKqW) / [https://ibb.co/x5sJLW6](https://ibb.co/x5sJLW6)\n\nRoku is a great play for the hardware and subscription based services for digital media players and has huge tailwinds that will benefit them while the old TV cycle is dying. They have had a huge year over year revenue growth and subscribers growth that has passed the 40 million mark for the first time recently. [https://ibb.co/Fqd7sYP](https://ibb.co/Fqd7sYP) / [https://ibb.co/ccKqzkC](https://ibb.co/ccKqzkC)\n\nWhile SunRun is another great play for the new Biden administration as well as the transitioning to more renewable energy as they may see a huge boost in revenue growth and earnings with more money being pumped into the renewable sector. [https://ibb.co/0jr3TRg](https://ibb.co/0jr3TRg) / [https://ibb.co/NmdSdwP](https://ibb.co/NmdSdwP)\n\nEveryone also knows Starbucks, as I expect them to be a huge gainer on a improved US-China relationship so despite suffering a lot from this economy the stock is still up more than 16% in the last year while revenues have declined, expect this to bounce back by 2021-2022. [https://ibb.co/s5nTzQX](https://ibb.co/s5nTzQX) / [https://ibb.co/fDyhvX3](https://ibb.co/fDyhvX3)\n\nShopify is a multinational e-commerce cloud based platform for merchants like small and medium sized business so that can easily have an online store that they can manage payments for, orders inventory and much more. The company is trading at P/E\u2019s that are crazy but the revenue and EPS growth is also amazing and has the potential for a lot more growth as the world is going more and more digital. [https://ibb.co/6nt4GhC](https://ibb.co/6nt4GhC) / [https://ibb.co/QbFhybt](https://ibb.co/QbFhybt)\n\nStore capital is a real estate investment trust that focuses on single tenant commercial real estate so they can negotiate much better rents and collections than other REIT. They are still more than 8$ under the highs and are a great diversification and yield giving stock to own. [https://ibb.co/XzBY41g](https://ibb.co/XzBY41g) / [https://ibb.co/TrGRZpR](https://ibb.co/TrGRZpR)\n\nAT&amp;T is one of the largest providers in the us and seems to be getting back on track after they have struggled in the past decade, they trade at only 8 times forward P/E and have one of the best dividend yields at more than 7% so I believe this is a must have staple in your portfolio that brings stability and cash flow. [https://ibb.co/cYcfYMm](https://ibb.co/cYcfYMm) / [https://ibb.co/8D3NzZr](https://ibb.co/8D3NzZr)\n\nWhile Target has been doing some amazing things as they operate as a general merchandise retailers and are doing some amazing things with online sales, they currently have seen a spike in the last months and are trading at a p/e of over 22 but I see them as a long term winner that offers both growth and value with a dividend yield of 1,5%. [https://ibb.co/Fzd8TMw](https://ibb.co/Fzd8TMw) / [https://ibb.co/NLnw4Lv](https://ibb.co/NLnw4Lv)\n\nWhile the other communication provider that I like is T-Mobile US which has seen a huge spike in user growth and are poised to do a lot of great things with the 5G cycle, they trade at a very high multiple for this sector but the growth expectations are huge for this company. [https://ibb.co/PCDFD38](https://ibb.co/PCDFD38) / [https://ibb.co/BTSzTMp](https://ibb.co/BTSzTMp)\n\nMoving on, one of the biggest gainers this year, TESLA is also one of my favorite companies to own as they continue to expand the products they offer and improve margins on vehicle, they are also expanding into more and more services, while manufacturing is growing exponentialy. They trade at insane P/E\u2019s but they have just managed to be included in the SP500 so this may bring some stability to the stock as the company continues to grow in the next decade.[https://ibb.co/6rNJf6q](https://ibb.co/6rNJf6q) / [https://ibb.co/CWN6wD4](https://ibb.co/CWN6wD4)\n\nVisa is the biggest global payments technology company and is expected to continue to grow as more people start using cashless payment options, they are a great growth and value company for the future as cash payments is a dying proposition worldwide. [https://ibb.co/CVXgZD9](https://ibb.co/CVXgZD9) / [https://ibb.co/BPKxFfZ](https://ibb.co/BPKxFfZ)\n\nWal-Mart, the biggest employer in the US continues to do amazing stuff as they continue to expand they\u2019re online presence and compete with Amazon as they trade at a 23 P/E and also offer a dividend yield. they are a great play alongside with Amazon which trades at much higher valuations. [https://ibb.co/Sr9s83J](https://ibb.co/Sr9s83J) / [https://ibb.co/0CvZKkD](https://ibb.co/0CvZKkD)\n\nWynn is another great recovery stock that I like as recently we found out that foot traffic in Macau has ramped up, this bolds well for the company as they will be one of the biggest gainers on the reopening. So if you are a long term investor you should get into this stock I believe. [https://ibb.co/6rk2qNQ](https://ibb.co/6rk2qNQ) / [https://ibb.co/mC35VPr](https://ibb.co/mC35VPr)\n\nZoom is the one company that I will be selling in the next couple of days. I know they are one of the best video conferencing apps out there, but I believe they will have a lot of problem due to a number of free apps that also offer great quality while the company is trading at insane p/e numbers. I know this trend is here to stay, but I thing there are far better play in the stock market out there rather than Zoom at this price point.  [https://ibb.co/T1tStb8](https://ibb.co/T1tStb8) / [https://ibb.co/rmxh0x3](https://ibb.co/rmxh0x3)\n\nI know I didn\u2019t get into in-depth stuff, technical analysis, fundamentals and more but I will continue go more in depth with this stocks as time goes on. \n\nSo here how I want to make my portfolio look like when I have enough money to open all the positions. [TARGETED PORTFOLIo](https://ibb.co/CHWsb27)\n\nAs you can see a quarter of my portfolio will be invested in high quality companies that are pretty safe in my opinion. While over 45% of the portfolio will go to companies that I really like, that have a pretty low risk in my opinion and can offer great returns in the future. While I will also use about 22% of my portfolio into more risky companies that can bring very good profits for the portfolio but in my opinion are not as safe as the others. \n\nAnd finally I will invest about 7% of my portfolio into more speculative stocks or hedge stocks like Barrick Gold and Goldman Sachs. I don\u2019t want to keep money on the sidelines at the moment as I expect the stock market will keep rising for a couple of years at a rapid pace due to the recovery of the economy.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "The Economist this weekend has some great articles on this ([1](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/11/12/value-investing-is-struggling-to-remain-relevant), [2](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2020/11/14/does-value-investing-still-work)). I don't really want to push the view that value investing doesn't work anymore; I think that's a red herring. I would love to dig into the idea of \"intangible\" assets being more valuable, yet also that most investors don't understand them.\n\nI believe my entire investment strategy over the past 8 years has been focused on intangible assets that end up generating large amounts of revenue for companies, but only after years of investment. These include data assets, advertising models fuelled by eyeballs, or enablement of marketplaces (e.g., Shopify, Airbnb, SEA Group, etc.). \n\nThe way I tend to approach intangible investments is to answer \"yes\" to all of the following questions:\n\n1. Does the company have an effective product that *some* people (i.e., a small current market) consider \"best in the market\"?\n2. If the product moves from *some* people buying it to *most* people buying it, will the company 10x its market cap?\n3. Are there current players in the space that are 10x bigger than the company? This shows me that it's possible to displace/disrupt current leaders with a new product and strategy and actually capture a massive market. Think: Netflix in its early days (vs. Blockbuster), think Shopify on its IPO day vs. PayPal, Ebay, etc...\n4. Do I believe the management team and founders could execute on this?\n\nThere are other signals to look for; if I'm right 1/3 of the time and make 10x on those companies, while losing on everyone else, the portfolio can still 3x itself... Sort of like a VC strategy in public markets. I can write *pages* on this topic, but would rather hear how other people approach intangible investment strategies.\n\nDoes anyone here have an intangible investment strategy? If so, how do you think about this?",

Paysafe is a non-US based competitor to PayPal and Stripe.  \n\nPSTH seems pretty hyped on a potential Strip merger (higher valuation), yet there seems to be fairly limited excitement for BFT. Any idea why? BFT is trading much, much lower than PSTH, likely due to the valuation difference, but it still seems list a drastic difference. This is after BFT's 60%+ jump last week, as it was trading under $1 and is now at $1.50.\n\nThoughts?",

        "selftext": "**Note:** *This thread involves the discussion of PYPL future earnings based on sales of cryptocurrencies and is not meant to discuss cryptocurrency as an investment.* *No opinion is given on cryptocurrency itself, and it is purely being viewed as revenue growth for PYPL moving forward.*\n\nOk, so, I've been thinking about SQ revenue growth and comparing the numbers for PYPL and I need someone to convince me not to yolo a good chunk of my life savings on PYPL calls for June 2021. Here are some basic facts to look at.\n\n* SQ has generated $1.63B in revenue from cryptocurrency sales in Q3 2020\n* SQ has generated $32 million of gross profit from this cryptocurrency revenue\n* SQ Q3 revenue was reported **before the massive cryptocurrency price rally** and Q4 revenue can be expected to be much higher\n\nSeems simple enough to me that SQ can expect increased profits in Q4 with significant revenue growth directly correlating to increased volume in cryptocurrency markets. Now, for PYPL and my admittedly retarded ideas.\n\n* PYPL launched a beta program to allow cryptocurrency purchases on a very limited amount of accounts\n* Since the beta program launched, Paxos, the partnered exchange handling the actual sales of cryptocurrency through PayPal, has seen significant volume increase\n* Daily volume on ItBit, the Paxos exchange, ranged from $3-8m on average before PYPL partnered with Paxos\n* Daily volume on ItBit has now increased dramatically, spiking as high as $25-50m daily volume, all happening while PYPL *is* *still in the beta program with very limited access*\n* PYPL has announced they intend to open the program to the public in the next couple of weeks\n* PYPL has 361 million active users, and SQ has 32 million active users, over 10x the base\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I crazy or is PYPL really a no-brainer?

        "selftext": "SQ has been experiencing meteoric growth recently, but it is only the beginning. The key to interpreting future movements is looking at the fintech industry as a whole. By far the largest company within this sector is PayPal (PYPL). PayPal\u2019s market cap is ~2.7 times the size of Square\u2019s, yet offers less services. The only reason PayPal is larger than Square is because of its earlier IPO and subsequent market relevancy. Square has been expanding its brand by buying up smaller financial service companies, like Cashapp and Credit Karma. Cash app\u2019s current user base is about 1/12 the size of PayPal\u2019s, but I think growth is in order with the shifting age demographics of fintech\u2019s user base. PayPal is the Facebook of online payment apps, while Square is the Twitter (owned by the same guy too). I believe that Square\u2019s market cap will surpass 250 billion within a year\u2019s time, and take PayPal\u2019s throne at the top of the industry. \n\nTL;DR: BUY SQ LEAPS AND SHARES ASAP \n\nPosition: SQ 200c Jan. 21 2022",

So, I have deposited and invested in the stock market all the money I managed to save up in the last month as I deposited 3500$ in my eToro portfolio on the 12th of November and I am already up more than 7% in just two weeks. \n\nAs my portfolio has constantly outperform the big 3 indexes the Nasdaq100, the SP500 and the Dow Jones 30 almost every day since starting my portfolio. Here is a comparison of my portfolio vs the indexes since starting as I am up over 7%. [Portfolio v Index](https://ibb.co/pRnQLQf)\n\nSo i wondered? Is it really bad to own more stocks? Is less &gt; more? What is your opinion on this subject? I believe that it is way better to be invested in more companies and to add and grow your position in time as you also see how the companies evolve and you can also do some price averaging.\n\nSo here is my current portfolio composition as I split all my money equally to start, I will go into very few little details about everyone so I don\u2019t make this a 2 hour read time.\n\nI will start now by going alphabetically and not in the most important order as the first company that I own is BYD which is a rival company for both Tesla and NIO in the EV market as they focus on cars, new energy solutions and electronics. They are also developing a lot of commercial EV like buses, coaches and taxis which will be a great addressable market for them as they are not rivaled in those segments at the moment. The company has gone up a lot in value this year as you can see in this graph and have a Forward P/E of more than 100 but I believe this company will greatly expand its sales and be one of the leaders in the segment especially in China which is the biggest EV market.

Is there a lack of leadership/vision to do so? \n\nOr does it simply come down to the potential for growth being limited, with a mature business model not scalable further? Does their business model simply lack opportunities to develop in new areas, since that they\u2019ve spun off PayPal?

Sunday eve I [posted my plays](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jmbuff/i_draw_with_crayons_so_you_dont_have_to_this/) for the week and opened those positions Monday morning. Sitting on about $4k profits which I've closed out some and may or may not let the others ride out for a few additional percentage points. Think I might take out your wife for some nice lobster and then to pound-town to finish off a good week. My next play is absolutely free money and literally wont go tits up.\n\n**Weekend Plays**\n\nCRM - Salesforce: 100 shares @ $237 cost basis. Currently $251 per share and 6% profit or $1,400.\n\nDOCU: Sold 2x cash secured puts for $1,700 and closed them out this morning at $272 for $1,400 gain.\n\nJD: Sold 2x CSP for $640. Up $400 and will let the rest ride.\n\nPYPL: Sold 3x CSP for earnings and closed yesterday at $600 profit when the stock was flat in the morning.\n\nThese plays had minimal risk since the stocks would need to drop another 5-10% for me to be assigned. I knew mango man had my back and wouldn't let me down. Positions -Yes I'm using all the margin and buying power my account has to offer, but if I could use more I would since this put-selling is pretty fucking hard to fail at. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g4tss1y23ax51.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f0c4b547ee537007b8bed7e738750ef5fe19f1d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Next earnings YOLO - QCOM**\n\nIt doesn't matter if you know what QCOM does or doesn't do. The only thing you need to know is that it's a solid company that has absolutely m00ned over the last 6 months. I entered a earnings YOLO selling yet more puts expiring this fucking friday. You might think selling puts is some pussy shit, but if you hate money then definitely don't do this.\n\nPOSITIONS: 2x cash-secured puts sold at $124 strike price collecting $440 US-DOLLARS.

        "selftext": "I have taken some numbers from reports available online, firstly  \nIn May 2019, Citron exposed the problems at Jumia Technologies (JMIA) that included: \n\n\u2022 Discrepancies in financials between investor presentations and SEC filings   \n\u2022 Fraudulent orders   \n\u2022 A company burdened with inefficiencies   \n\n\nHowever, as Citron themselves have stated, now everything has changed. Starting an e-commerce business in an emerging market will have its challenges, the rewards can be great for patient investors as we\u2019ve seen with MELI, BABA and SE. Over the past year, the pandemic has accelerated the global shift to e-commerce and JMIA has benefited from:   \n\n\n\u2022 Acceleration of e-commerce adoption by Nigerian consumers   \n\u2022 The renewed focus on profitability   \n\u2022 The rapid acceptance of fintech products in Nigeria including JumiaPay   \n\u2022 The ability to use JMIA has a platform for ancillary products    \n\n\nThere is no denying that the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated e-commerce globally. JMIA is the key beneficiary as it is the only scaled e-commerce player in Africa. You can\u2019t deny the numbers:   \n\n\n\u2022 1.3 billion population   \n\u2022 523 million internet users   \n\u2022 Fastest growing continent in the world that will account for &gt;50% of global population growth between now and 2050   \n\u2022 McKinsey estimates that Africa e-commerce will grow to a $75 billion market opportunity by 2025   \n\u2022 In Nigeria, over 40% of the population is under the age of 14 and over 50% of registered voters are under the age of 35   \n\n\nAs analysts have said, \"EITHER THESE YOUNG NIGERIANS WILL BE THE FIRST PEOPLE ON EARTH TO NOT ACCEPT E-COMMERCE OR THE STOCK IS GOING TO $100\"  \n\n\nJMIA Pay  \nOne of the largest criticisms of conducting e-commerce in Africa was the continent\u2019s reliance on a cash economy, which is obviously not e-commerce friendly. JMIA has created their own digital currency \u2013 think PayPal, which now accounts for 24% of GMV and 36% of orders. Last month, McKinsey\u2019s comments on the future of fintech can also be applied to e-commerce: \u201cA youthful population, increasing smartphone penetration, and a focused regulatory drive to increase financial inclusion and cashless payments, are combining to create the perfect recipe for a thriving fintech sector.\u201d The takeaway is no matter who wins in fintech, JMIA and e-commerce are winners.   \n\n\nForget about valuation and look more at significance. The country of Nigeria is dedicated to making e-commerce work to increase the quality of life of their growing and sizeable population. Consider this \u2013 JMIA is now shipping over 20 million packages a year to cities and rural areas across 11 countries. Nigeria is benefiting from the logistics network, technology and product offerings that JMIA has brought to this long overlooked part of the world. JMIA is at the epicenter of this movement and the only scaled e-commerce player in Africa.",

        "selftext": "Hello, everyone. I'm well aware as--with investing in general--there's a risk associated with it. However, for a long term investing perspective (for me, this is **5-10 years**), this is my portfolio. However, I'm going to list my portfolio down here and tell me what you guys think about it: \n\n$TSLA - 30%. I invested in TSLA because they are a multi-industry company, encompassing areas other than their known specialty--**EV creation**\\--such as A.I., renewable energy efficiency, IoT, transportation, and much more. \n\n$NIO - 15%. I am a big bull for NIO. Although the risk it carries in the short term is extremely high (due to high potential of regulation with the Chinese government as well as still unprofitable), this stock has extremely high potential in the long term to grow. It's potential of growth is being able to expand to other countries as well as it's BaaS and constant battery efficiency increases (people want EV cars that can drive for long distances). It's not only backed by the Chinese government, but by its policy as well. By 2025, 20% of new vehicles made in China will be electric vehicles. This will not only benefit NIO but other industries such as XPEV and TSLA. And when NIO expands to other countries who have adopted this policy, then I expect increases in $NIO's share price. In the short term, NIO has been unprofitable, but its financials show drastic improvements compared to previous years. The company is doing what it needs to do to grow and that's important to me.\n\n$ARKK - 15%. This is an ETF. Let me tell you right now, though. I think Cathie Wood is a genius. This ETF is a compilation of holdings of different stocks, and its principle holding is TSLA. However, it also has just a big of a hand in other areas such as finances (SQUARE, PAYPAL), and genetics (CRISPR, NVITAE). I think these **emerging markets** have a high potential for the future because they **increase the quality of life of the regular person, just like EVs do**. In the short term, I think banks will still have a hold in terms of managing a person's wallet, but in 5-10 years I can see *digital wallets* through square and paypal becoming principle. Moreover, CRISPR and NVITAE have a great potential. CRISPR and NVITAE not only aim to **extend the length of human life**, but moreso aim to **increase the quality of human life**. For those with inborn genetic diseases, the ability for CRISPR and NVITAE's gene manipulation technologies are able to 1. detect onset of disease early, 2. be able to identify therapies in conjunction with health care systems. I'm a registered nurse, although I've only been so for 2 years, and I can tell you: even a random person on the street can tell you that anything that can relieve chronic and acute ailments is good for humanity as a whole. \n\n$BYD (in the form of BYDDF) - 12%. $BYD is similar to $TSLA in that it doesn't focus on a single industry. I think where this stock shines is its ability to undercut day-to-day transportation. For example, the electric trucks that BYD manufactures and sells are less costly than the usage of train transportation, which is so much less costly than using the gas-powered trucks for transportation. Plus, it's backed by the legend himself, Warren Buffett. And if you look at the fundamentals yourself, they're been doing what they need to do to do great. They're vertically integrated and can keep up with supply/demand. I love 'em. \n\n$FINX - 8%. this is also an ETF similar to ARKK. However, it's focus is more on the emerging market in terms of financial (SQUARE, PAYPAL, etc). \n\n$DAL - 5%. Delta airlines stock. Right now, delta airlines has been down because of COVID. You and I both know from watching the news that all airline and transportation services have just been down because of the need to social distance and virus containment protocols. Nevertheless, prior to COVID this stock has been on a uptrend and its fundamentals have been great. **Do I think COVID will last forever?** No. With that said, I do think this stock will inevitable go back up and that hasn't been priced in yet. \n\n$AMZN - 10%. Bezos has been doing what he needs to make his company successful. Amazon is just like TSLA in terms of targeting more than one industry. While TSLA focuses on the technology side of things, Amazon focuses on the commercial goods and day-to-day needs/wants kind of thing.

Now we know Elon and Thiel are buddies and being the \"Don\" of the paypal mafia, our new dad papa Thiel's net worth is only about 5.7b, which is rookie number, weak af and we need to pump him to at least the 100b club. \n\nNow according to my 3s google research, Thiel owns about 8% of the PLTR stocks, so in order to pump him to 100b, we need PLTR to reach market cap of 1.25t, which puts it just between AMZN and GOOG, which is exactly where PLTR should be valued at. Currently PLTR has about 1.6b shares, so we need to pump the share price to about 781.25$/share for our new dad to be in the 100b club, so fucking easy considering we have already pumped TSLA to 2500+/share pre-split.

I now want to increase that percentage by a lot, so I have been doing a lot of reading, and here are some take-aways:\n\n* I will keep 12 months of living-costs as cash, and invest the rest\n* I am by nature risk-averse (need to be able to sleep at night), but partially also greedy of course (FOMO), so I want to strike a balance between the 2 in my investment strategy\n* This translates into preferring ETFs / diversification over individual stocks / concentration\n* Preferably, I will be able to strike a balance also between growing the portfolio(s) value over time, and gradually take out, instead of reinvesting, dividends.\n\nTaking all this into account, I was thinking to split my investments over multiple portfolios, that I can individually adjust according to the times and my ideas. I understand that taken together, it is in fact only one portfolio, but I mostly want to structure my thoughts. One can easily get overwhelmed how and where to invest in.\n\n**Portfolio 1: All Weather Portfolio (50% of all investments) - Low Risk**\n\nIn this portfolio, I replaced gold (GLD) and commodities (SGS) with VPU, because gold is set to probably decrease in price over the next years, and historically, commodities haven't performed all that well. State-regulated, well-run Utilities seem to be a better choice, also when I was back-testing.
