Introduction\n\nSorry for the wall of text - but if you are serious about trading **please read through this -** I think you all could really benefit from a bit of intermarket analysis - and I see way too many victims of ignorance here who could prevent their losses by understanding these relatively simply concepts.\n\nThis sub is primarily focused on IWM names (Russell 2000/Small Caps). If you look at that stock - **it's been sideways for almost a year**. No secret you all have been losing tons of money as of late on your favorite stocks (Except MVST - nice one there).\n\nIn my eyes - for the best probability of success - you always want to be playing the names that are within the strongest index at the time (or simply playing the strongest index itself). I determine which is the strongest via charting plus some simple intermarket relationships. \n\nLast year during the recovery we got a huge **everything rally** \\- that is not usually the case. Money constantly rotates from sector to sector - this is how it usually is - and how it's been for most of 2021. For instance - notice today (8/102021) tech is dropping while financials, materials and other inflation camp names are pumping. This is one of many useful correlations.\n\n# II. The Indices\n\nThe indices are large groups of stocks lumped in together that usually move in unison. Most of you probably already know this. I'm just going to list out what each index is and what it focuses on.\n\n**S&amp;P 500 (SPY, SPX, ES)**\n\n*from Wikipedia*\n\n\"The Standard and Poor's 500, or simply the S&amp;P 500, is a stock market index that tracks 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States. It is one of the most commonly followed equity indices.\"\n\nBasically a compilation of most large caps in the United States. Great gage of overall market health - and sort of a cross between the other two large cap indexes (Nasdaq 100, Dow Jones).\n\n**Nasdaq 100 (QQQ, NDX, NQ)**\n\n*from Wikipedia*\n\n\"The Nasdaq-100 is a stock market index made up of 102 equity securities issued by 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock market. It is a modified capitalization-weighted index. \"\n\nThese are going to be mostly your large cap growth names (tech stocks) - but there are a few boomer names in there. Just more heavy on the growth side than the other indexes.\n\n**Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA, DJIA, YM)**\n\n*from Wikipedia*\n\n\"The Dow Jones Industrial Average, Dow Jones, or simply the Dow, is a price-weighted measurement stock market index of 30 prominent companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States.\"\n\nThese are going to be your \"boomer\" names - I like to call it the boomer index. Value, materials, healthcare etc. Not really any growth names in there (except AAPL, CRM I guess). One thing I like to note is that **all the names in Dow Jones are present in the S&amp;P 500 - the Dow is the most closely correlated index to the S&amp;P** (about a 0.92 correlation iirc).\n\n**Russell 2000 Index (IWM, RUT, RTY)**\n\n*from Wikipedia*\n\n\"The Russell 2000 Index is a small-cap stock market index of the smallest 2,000 stocks in the Russell 3000 Index. It was started by the Frank Russell Company in 1984. The index is maintained by FTSE Russell, a subsidiary of the London Stock Exchange Group.\"\n\nThese are all your small cap names. There is also a Russell 1000 and Russell 3000. Notice how many more companies are in here than the other indexes. This one isn't going to be moved by one or two stocks. Small caps usually benefit from risk on environments (they are perceived to be riskier) - but note the more speculative growth ones will lag in those situations. \n\nThese are also **meme stocks - pretty much every single one is in a Russell Index.** If you are someone who likes to play memes - you always want to watch IWM. When this one is popping off is when they will be making a run.\n\n# III. Risk On vs Risk Off (Inflation vs Deflation Camp)\n\nMoving onto more practical applications of this information. I could do a section on Forex, Bonds, etc. - but honestly you only need to know what they are to apply the analysis that I do.\n\nThe primary narrative driving the market in recent times is whether we are getting inflation or deflation - and this has dictated the flow of money.\n\n**Risk On (Inflation Camp)**\n\nRisk on is when you are going to see a rotation into \"risk assets\". People predicting inflation believe the Fed will raise rates and that inflation will continue to rise - so they are flowing into banks, energy, materials, value stocks and some Forex pairs - things that will benefit from more inflation, and things that perform better in a high interest rate environment.\n\nBanks make an interest rate spread on deposits received versus money lent out. In a rising rate environment, banks benefit because they are still paying a lower interest on deposits, but making a greater spread on money lent out. \n\nCommodities and materials (energy) benefit from inflation for obvious reasons - they will scale as inflation increases.\n\nValue stocks benefit here because people are **hunting for yield** \\- this is the main point in a risk on environment. Value stocks **make money** and often pay it out via **dividends or share buybacks** which create value for shareholders. They also generally **aren't** **dependent on debt.** When rates rise - money becomes more expensive to borrow - and companies that depend on it will generally perform worse.\n\nAUD/JPY is the main forex pair I watch for risk on moves. Basically - AUD = riskier currency, JPY = safe haven currency. As a result - when AUD/JPY is going up - money is likely flowing into risk assets.\n\nSmall caps generally perform well here because they are perceived to be riskier. Remember, risk on = money flowing to risk assets.\n\nIn a risk on environment **Dow Jones** will usually outperform. Remember that's where you find your boomer value names.\n\nEquities as a whole will generally do well in a risk on environment. This gets a bit tricky when we are expecting a rate raise at any moment - but stocks in general are considered a hedge for inflation.\n\n**Risk Off (Deflation Camp)**\n\nThis is the exact opposite of risk on. Money flows out of risk assets and into safe assets. People predicting deflation believe current inflation expectations are overblown and the increase is transitory. They also think the Fed won't raise rates for a while. In general - **the fed lowers rates to stimulate economic activity and stave off deflation. Subsequently - money flows into safe haven assets and things that benefit from low interest rates and protect from deflation.** These are going to be your growth names, bonds, the dollar and the VIX.\n\nGrowth performs well here because when interest rates are low - money is cheaper to borrow. **Growth depends on debt to continue it's operations. Most of them also don't make money and so they have** **no yield.**  An increase in interest rates will raise the cost of capital making it harder for companies to generate higher returns. With rising rates, a company has to pay a higher interest expense that lowers their overall profitability. Lower profits lead to lower cash flows, which lead to a higher required rate of return for investors, all of which lead to a lower valuation for the company's share price. \n\nBonds perform well because remember - investors are expecting **rates to fall** in this situation. If your coupon will be lower in the future - why wouldn't you buy now while it's still as high as it is. Not only that - but bonds are **safe haven assets -** they provide a fixed rate of return (unlike equities) - and so they are perceived to be much safer.\n\nThe dollar performs well because it is **the safe haven currency.** It's the worlds primary reserve currency - so in times of economic hardship people put their money there to protect it. Also - if we are **deflating** \\- the dollar is gaining value.\n\nThe VIX performs well because it's **essentially a measure of how hedged SPX players are**. If you are expecting deflation in assets - you are expecting prices to drop for the most part - and so you want to be hedged on your long positions (or make straight bear bets).\n\n**In Summary**\n\n&lt; *Risk On &gt;*\n\n* Financials\n* Commodities\n* Value\n* Materials\n* AUD/JPY\n* **Russell 2000**\n* **Dow Jones**\n\n&lt; *Risk Off &gt;*\n\n* Bonds\n* Growth\n* Dollar\n* VIX\n* **Nasdaq 100**\n\n# IV. Practical Applications\n\nFirst let me go over the tickers I watch for each rotation -\n\n&lt; *Risk On &gt;*\n\n* YM (DIA)\n* RTY (IWM)\n* CL (Crude Oil Futures)\n* ZC (Corn Futures)\n* AUD/JPY\n\n*&lt; Risk Off &gt;*\n\n* DXY (Dollar Index)\n* ZB (30 Year Treasury Bonds)\n* TNX (10 Year Treasury Index)\n* VIX (The \"Fear Index\")\n* NQ (QQQ)\n* ARKK (This is a bit newer and less common - but I find it useful to track speculative growth names that perform quite well in a deflationary environment)\n\nGlancing at a watchlist of these will give you a quick picture of where money is flowing at the moment - but in order to predict the odds of future movements (and more profitable ones) - I perform technical analysis on all of these names.\n\nBasically - I analyze all the indices and only play the one that is the strongest from a technical standpoint. I further filter these signals and determine position sizing by analyzing their correlated assets.\n\nFor instance - if **DIA** is breaking out - and **ZB** is breaking down - this is confluence for a risk on rotation. The more confluence - the higher probability you have of success in any play.\n\nOn the contrary, if **DIA** is breaking out - and **ZB** is rallying - this is a sign one of the moves is likely fake - and a signal I have lower odds of success. Subsequently, I want to size smaller.\n\n***Let's take a look at one example in which QQQ (Growth, Risk Off) caught the rotation this past May. This is a perfect example of Bonds and Growth moving in unison to provide a high probability long trade in QQQ and TLT. Note: I just use trendlines and volume for my technical analysis. No indicators.***\n\n[NQ \\(QQQ\\)](https://preview.redd.it/fdtd97r9fkg71.png?width=1696&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e7c58fa94c018f4d6fb5b38585a4d474f77b5c6)\n\nThe red circle is Nasdaq on **5/13.** You can see that is the day it bottomed - and every day since then pretty much Nasdaq, tech, and risk off assets have been leading. Not only that - but on **6/22** it broke a huge technical setup (the big red line) - which triggered a ton more upside.\n\n[TLT \\(ZB\\)](https://preview.redd.it/cuq89v4hfkg71.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=836d02a7fc13c175aebc93f080d705679b0b2f7c)\n\nThe red circle here is also **5/13.** You can see that is also the day that TLT (ZB or Bonds) bottomed - and every day since then except for the past three days - it's held the same uptrend. Not only that - but on **6/22** it also broke that big red line - which was a downtrend stemming from last year - triggering more upside here as well. We also broke out of that teal symmetrical triangle, which provided more confluence for the move.\n\nI try to assign a signal strength to each move in order to make it easier for my monkey brain to understand.\n\n* **Indexes:** 3\n* **Bonds:** 2\n* **Everything Else:** 1\n\nYou will see a lot of people say bonds are everything - and in my experience that is very true. Last year we had an extremely odd situation where risk parity was fucked - but in recent times it has come back. Correlations almost always revert to the mean at **some point**. Subsequently - you could watch just bonds and the indices and efficiently track the flow of money. The others are just if you want to filter your signals further or are unsure about a move.\n\n# V. Divergences\n\nCorrelations are not perfect. If they were - everyone would be a billionaire. There are times when we get divergences and things move opposite of the way they usually do. Like I said - they **almost** **always revert to the mean** at some point - but the catch is the divergence could blow your account before it reverts back. If you are good with technicals you can easily spot when a setup you are trying to play breaks down and stop loss accordingly - but the key point here is **always have a stop loss when playing correlations.** Lots of people think they can average down infinitely and eventually profit off the arbitrage that comes with assets reverting to the mean - but **the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.**\n\n# IV. TL;DR\n\nThe main thing to takeaway here is the indices. If QQQ is weak - maybe you want to take a look at DIA. If IWM is sideways - maybe you want to take a look at QQQ. Keep your head on a swivel and don't be too biased towards one sector. **If you can effectively track the flow of money - you can theoretically catch every rotation.**\n\nAlso - you don't have to apply the technicals I do to track it. That's just my method. Lot's of people use complex macroeconomic analysis to assess these sorts of things, among other methods. I'm just too smooth brained for that.\n\nI hope this helped you all - and if anyone has questions drop it in the comments.",

I could do a section on Forex, Bonds, etc. - but honestly you only need to know what they are to apply the analysis that I do.\n\nThe primary narrative driving the market in recent times is whether we are getting inflation or deflation - and this has dictated the flow of money.\n\n**Risk On (Inflation Camp)**\n\nRisk-On is described as a rotation from save haven assets into riskier assets. If market participants believe in high inflationary pressures, they will want to invest their cash into **\"risk\" assets,** like real estate and stocks, to combat the residual effects of inflation on their money. Additionally, they believe we are now in a rising rate environment (rates already at zero, likely to increase in the future), which would help benefit **value stocks, financials/banks, energy, specific forex/currencies**, anything that benefits from low rates (currently).\n\nMore specifically, **banks benefit from a gradual steady increase in interest rates.** Banks make an interest rate spread on deposits received versus money lent. In a rising rate environment, they are able to pay lower interest on their deposits and make a larger spread on their loans.\n\nCommodities, materials (energy), and consumer/defensive stocks **benefit from inflation** as they are able to pass on rising costs to consumers. Additionally, value/defensive stocks typically have a strong track-record of recurring dividends and share buybacks to provide yield to shareholders. Conversely, in later stages of rising rates, investors may divest from growth or tech stocks because rising rates have a direct effect on liquidity and cost of capital. **When rates are high, debt is heavier and money is more expensive.**\n\nAUD/JPY is an easy forex pair to watch for risk on movements based on the Australian economy in relation to Japan. A**UD is seen as a \"risk\" currency**, whereas **JPY is seen as a \"safe haven\"**. When AUDJPY is increasing, typically this is a sign of \"risk-on\". This is only one of many pairs to watch for in Forex Markets, considering Forex Markets are much larger than the stock market.\n\nRemember, in the early stages of inflation, small caps or tech stocks will perform well because the negative impact of inflation on sitting in cash; however, if the federal reserve is required to combat hyper/stagflation worries, they will raise rates and growth or tech stocks may perform poorly in that environment. Furthermore, **Dow Jones Industrial Average (boomer)** names will usually outperform, and investors today may be pricing-in this effect.\n\nEquities as a whole will generally do well in a risk-on environment. Stocks are considered a hedge for inflation, but watch-out for JPOW and his antics later on.\n\n**Risk Off (Deflation Camp)**\n\nThis is the opposite of risk-on. Money rotates out of risk assets into safe havens. People in the deflation corner believe inflation is transitory, asset prices will decline, and virtually **assume the Federal Reserve won't have to raise rates**. In low inflation or deflationary environment, money flows **to safe haven assets out of risk assets**. Participants would hoard cash (increasing in value) and wait for asset prices to decline. They would invest in **bonds, safe haven currencies, speculate on an increase in volatility, and save cash to reinvest later.**\n\nBonds outperform because investors believe rates will remain low or fall further. **They'd be able to receive a** **\"higher\" interest rate today versus in the future.** Bonds are typically safer than equities because they are first in-line in the event of a liquidation (bankruptcy) and earn a fixed rate of return. Additionally, the **USD, JPY, CHF** perform well because they are a 'safe-haven' currency. The US Dollar is still considered the world's reserve currency. (Trust in the US Economy/Risk Free). In addition, deflation comes with a natural increase in the dollar's value.\n\nThe VIX performs well because it's **essentially a measure of how hedged SPX players are**. If you are expecting deflation in assets - you are expecting prices to drop for the most part - and so you want to be hedged on your long positions (or make straight bear bets).\n\nIn recent times - growth also performs well here because when interest rates are low - money is cheaper to borrow. **Growth depends on debt to continue it's operations. Most of them also don't make money and so they have** **no yield.** An increase in interest rates will raise the cost of capital making it harder for companies to generate higher returns. With rising rates, a company has to pay a higher interest expense that lowers their overall profitability. Lower profits lead to lower cash flows, which lead to a higher required rate of return for investors, all of which lead to a lower valuation for the company's share price. Note this is primarily due to recent macroeconomic events - and in the past all equities have been considered risk on.\n\n**In Summary**\n\nToday, the Federal Reserve has created a low interest rate environment to stimulate the economy; through allowing participants to borrow funds \"cheaper\" or lower rates. This stimulates demand, supply, borrowing, lending... overall growth. Asset prices are attempting to \"price-in\" the future state of the economy.\n\nIf you believe that inflation is here to stay, then you'd want to shift into risk-assets. If you believe that inflation is 'transitory', then you'd want to move towards safe haven assets. Ultimately, you could assume that the Federal Reserve controls the narrative and that any major movements in the flow of money, cost of debt (change in rates), could have a positive or negative impact on asset prices. In either scenario (in the future), inflation can lead to higher interest rates causing a drop in asset prices or deflation worries can keep interest rates low and fuel the rally for longer than one would expect. I hope that makes sense.\n\n&lt;Risk-On&gt;\n\n* Financials\n* Commodities\n* Value\n* Materials\n* Real Estate\n* **Basically Most Equities**\n* AUD/JPY (AND OTHER RISK-ON CURRENCY PAIRS)\n\n&lt;Risk-Off&gt;\n\n* Bonds\n* Dollar\n* VIX\n* Growth/Disruptor Equities (SOMETIMES - THIS IS A NEW CORRELATION STEMMING FROM COVID MAKING TECH NAMES SAFE HAVENS AMONG OTHER UNPRECEDENTED FACTORS)\n\n# IV.

The Federal Reserve has been purchasing at least $120 billion of bonds per month to curb longer-term interest rates and jumpstart economic growth as the pandemic wreaked havoc on the economy.\n\nI've heard the saying that when economists say there will be a correction, it is the time to buy. And when the Government (the Fed) says the economy is in a good space, it is time to sell. \nThis is just all from anecdotal and media. I might be wrong. \n\nTaper talk is the worry, but if inflation continues to run hot and economic data continues to be mixed the timing of tapering could get pushed,\u201d noted Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that the Fed will force a taper on an economy that isn\u2019t ready, and the outlook is becoming less certain with the rise of the Delta variant.\u201d\n\nBell added that the deciding factor could be August\u2019s jobs report due Sept. 3, given that Covid cases have jumped in the past month as the delta variant spreads.\n\nSeveral tech companies will report earnings on Wednesday after the market closes, including Dow component Salesforce. Box and Snowflake are also on deck.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/24/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html?__source=androidappshare",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, August 23, 2021**\n\nStocks rebounded today, rising to fresh records after last week\u2019s volatility as fears surrounding a potential taper timeline, as alluded by the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest meeting minute, receded. Like I said last week, I viewed the dip following the meeting minutes as another overreaction by the market. To reiterate, I remain very bullish moving forward until the Federal Reserve starts to discuss a potential interest rate hike, which I expect in late 2022-early 2023. Looking ahead, market participants wait for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s annual Jackson Hole speech on Thursday. In my opinion, he likely will not reveal any additional details regarding a potential taper timeline in order to avoid another taper tantrum. ([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp#:\\~:text=Taper%20tantrum%20refers%20to%20the,quantitative%20easing%20(QE)%20program](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp#:~:text=Taper%20tantrum%20refers%20to%20the,quantitative%20easing%20(QE)%20program)).\n\nLast week, equities came under pressure after the Fed\u2019s July meeting minutes, which said \u201clooking ahead, most participants noted that, provided that the economy were to evolve broadly as anticipated, they judged it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year.\u201dAs I said above, this makes a lot of sense judging how the economy has also so far rebounded at a faster pace than expected. Given this record-breaking quarter in terms of corporate earnings and improving labor market conditions, the economy is beginning to be able to stand on its own without all the pandemic-era support. However, while progress has been made, the Fed\u2019s goal has not yet been reached. The meeting minutes said, \u201c most participants judged that the Committee\u2019s standard of \u201csubstantial further progress\u201d toward the maximum-employment goal had not yet been met.\u201d \n\nIn order to stave off another \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d and directly address interest rates concerns, the minutes explicitly stressed the need to \u201creaffirm the absence of any mechanical link between the timing of tapering and that of an eventual increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.\u201d Participants voted to maintain the interest rate near zero. I cannot stress this enough, potential interest rate hikes in 2023 will be the real test for equities.\n\n[https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210728.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210728.pdf)\n\nThis earnings season has been a smashing, record-breaking success. 91% of companies in the SPY have reported, with 87% of those outperforming estimates in revenue. The blended, year-over-year earnings growth rate is an eye-popping 85.1%, absolutely smashing original estimates of 66.5%. What is most remarkable is this comes among a resurgence of coronavirus cases due to the delta variant, supply-side disruptions, and labor market imbalances in the US. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The US Federal Drug Association (FDA) officially approved Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech\u2019s (BNTX) coronavirus vaccine. Until now, it was administered under emergency use authorization. Moderna\u2019s vaccine is likely to be approved in the next few days as well. Stock of vaccine-makers were higher. \n* Shares of cancer-research company Trillium Therapeutics (TRIL) were up 188% after Pfizer (PFE) acquired them for $2.26 billion. Andy Schmeltz, President of Pfizer Oncology said, \u201cThe proposed acquisition of Trillium builds on our strong track record of leadership in Oncology, enhancing our hematology portfolio as we strive to improve outcomes for people living with blood cancers around the globe\u201d.\n* Existing home sales unexpectedly rose in July, marking consecutive monthly gains. According to the National Association of Realtors, existing home sales rose 2%, compared to a 0.5% dip expected. \n* Ford Motors (F) has doubled its production target for the new F-150 Lightning pick-up truck due to strong early demand. The company now has a target of producing 80,000 in 2024, up from its previous target of 40,000.\n* Target (TGT) announced it planned to triple the number of Disney (DIS) shops within its stores by year's end. Target started hosting these Disney \u201cshop in a shop\u201d locations in 2019.\n* Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit said Boeing Co. will invest in the satellite-launching startup's planned $3.2 billion merger-listing later this year, an investment that comes as the plane maker's own space program faces hurdles. Shares of Virgin Galactic (SPCE) are still reeling following Branson\u2019s flight a few weeks ago.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* AbbVie (ABBV) target raised by Cowen from $120 to $130 at Outperform. Stock currently around $120\n* Abbott Labs (ABT) target raised by Cowen from $125 to $140 at Outperform.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 23rd, 2021.\n\n# **Fed officials will seek to avoid a tantrum as they keep \u2018taper talk\u2019 going at Jackson Hole - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/20/fed-officials-will-seek-to-avoid-a-tantrum-as-they-keep-taper-talk-going-at-jackson-hole.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts to reverse its easy policy will be a dominant theme for markets in the week ahead, as central bankers gather in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.\n*****\n&gt; The central bankers may even look relaxed against the backdrop of the Grand Tetons in the crisp late August air. But they will be under pressure to gently steer toward less policy support, without creating a market tantrum.\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve officials, in numerous recent speeches and interviews, have already managed to speed up expectations for when they could begin to slowly pare back their $120 billion a month in bond purchases. More of that talk is expected at their annual symposium, which begins Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed chairman\u2019s speech is typically the highlight of the annual event, and various Fed chairs have used Jackson Hole to send important messages. The question is whether Jerome Powell will channel his speech Friday morning to provide more details on how the Fed could begin to unwind its bond buying, and even whether he is personally ready to embrace it.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re not expecting a big policy reveal at this meeting,\u201d said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short strategy at Bank of America. \u201cI don\u2019t think Powell wants to front run the [September] meeting, given the myriad of voices that are out there. I don\u2019t think this is the time when Powell really wants to make a splash.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Besides the Fed, the week has a few economic reports. Existing home sales are released Monday; new home sales Tuesday and durable goods Wednesday. Friday has personal consumption expenditures data and the inflation index, closely watched by the Fed.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings are also expected from companies including Best Buy and Nordstrom on Tuesday, Salesforce.com on Wednesday and HP and Dell Technologies on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; # Fed and markets\nBut the Fed will matter most, as investors will also keep an eye on how the economy is responding to the spread of the Covid delta variant. Stocks were lower in the past week, with the S&amp;P 500 down 0.6%.\n*****\n&gt; There could be some volatility around the Fed\u2019s symposium, after the release this past Tuesday of minutes from the last official meeting rattled investors. The minutes described most members of the Federal Open Market Committee as being ready to taper this year if the economy is strong enough. Cabana said he changed his view after that release and now expects the Fed to begin paring back purchases in November, rather than January.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe just think this signal in communications is pretty clear,\u201d he said. \u201cFor now, it\u2019s safe to say they are wanting to start later this year, and we think the data will allow them to do that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; As for Powell, \u201che\u2019s not going to announce taper. What we anticipate is that he\u2019s going to give a live speech that talks about a lot of the progress that has been made since the start of Covid, and there\u2019s a lot of it,\u201d said Cabana. He said Powell could reiterate that the Fed will be data dependent in its decision to taper, and that many Fed officials believe it could make sufficient progress toward that goal later this year.\n*****\n&gt; The minutes caused hiccups in markets as investors reacted to the idea that the Fed will take its first steps toward peeling away the extraordinary amount of policy it used to fight the impact of the pandemic. Tapering the bond program could take months, but once it ends it could herald the onset of rate hikes.\n*****\n&gt; Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, said Powell should provide a road map for how the Fed will taper, but with the caveat of being able to step back if Covid becomes more serious than expected.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe asset purchases were initially to stabilize financial conditions. ... There\u2019s clearly a consensus building stronger than it even was at the last meeting in July, given how [Fed officials] have been speaking out since then,\u201d said Swonk. \u201cThey want to wind down asset purchases. As they wind them down, they\u2019re not hitting the brakes. They\u2019re only lifting their foot off the accelerator. The difference is important for [Powell] to lay out at Jackson Hole.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Swonk said the Fed needs to provide a road map for tapering, but also with off ramps in the event that Covid is worse than expected.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cTo avoid this becoming a tantrum and avoid financial markets seizing up again, he wants to get the messaging out and the context of it, as much as possible,\u201d Swonk said. \u201cIf this becomes a disorderly reaction and things are melting down, they would have to pivot. Where we\u2019re at is these types of purchases are no longer justified and may be detrimental in terms of how much liquidity they\u2019re putting into financial markets when its no longer needed.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/sxTwppT.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/XaZ3OqE.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/oLHqqFQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/iuH4ig1.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/lflLJO1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/7JLtvgO.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cnmvI5A.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Cqw6DkJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/QeyCpqJ.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/hV3LYS4.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wLwUeqE.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/4izjE1a.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/k1m7sYO.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # September Almanac: DJIA, S&amp;P 500 &amp; NASDAQ Worst Month of Year\n\n&gt; Start of the business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school once made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971), Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 (since 1979). After four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble buildup, S&amp;P 500 was down five Septembers straight from 1999-2003. In the 17 years since, S&amp;P 500 has advanced 11 times in September and declined six times.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/40afab5bf8a7d5d83f5c0df66416bd63/64275cde73d35d0e-b1/s400x600/f24c1395359fa121818eb1387e2f2cde70364a83.jpg))**\n\n&gt; In post-election years, September\u2019s overall rank improves modestly in post-election years going back to 1953 (third or fourth worst month depending on index). Average losses are little changed. Although September 2001 does influence the average declines, the fact remains DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have declined in 9 of the last 17 post-election year Septembers. Russell 2000 has the best post-election year record, up seven times in 10 years.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # US Dollar Breaks Out\n\n&gt; After roughly two months of declines, at the end of May the US dollar (proxied by Bloomberg's dollar index) found support around the lows from the first week of the year. Since then, the dollar has rallied 4.13%, moving back above its moving averages in the process which have also acted as support ever since. This week alone the dollar has gained 1.4%, and that upward move brings the dollar to the highest levels since early November and the early spring highs when the index stopped short of its 200-DMA.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082021-Dollar.png))**\n\n&gt; Taking a step back to look at the past five years, those lows that were reached earlier this spring and at the start of the year can actually be traced all the way back to early 2018 lows. Similarly, the recent highs that were taken out this week are around the same levels as the early 2016 lows. With the dollar now having broken out, it is no longer at the low end of that five-year range.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082021-Dollar-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # One of the Best Weeks of the Year for Claims\n\n&gt; Initial jobless claims hit another pandemic low this week dropping to 348K from last week's 2K upwardly revised reading of 377K. That was also 16K below expectations and the first better than expected print in six weeks. While recent releases have disappointed relative to forecasts, this week did mark the fourth week in a row that claims have dropped. That is the longest stretch of consecutive declines since a six-week streak ending on June 4th.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Initial-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**\n\n&gt; On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, initial claims fell to 308.57K which is again the lowest level since the start of the pandemic. Meanwhile, pandemic unemployment assistance claims ticked up to 109.38K from 103.85K the previous week. The main state driving that increase was Ohio which saw claims more than double. Maryland, Oregon, and California were the other states to have seen the biggest increase in PUA claims. Those increases also come even as the program is slated to end in just two weeks on September 4th.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Initial-Jobless-Claims-NSA.png))**\n\n&gt; As for the decline in claims for unadjusted regular state programs, we would caution against reading too deep into the number on account of strong seasonal tailwinds. As shown below, the current week of the year (33rd) is tied at second for the week of the year that most often sees claims decline. As shown in the second chart below, there has only been one year, last year, in which claims were higher week over week in the 33rd week of the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Initial-Jobless-Claims-Seasonal-1a.png))**\n\n&gt; Seasonally adjusted continuing claims missed expectations by 20K this week, but at 2.82 million, this week's reading still marked a third consecutive decline. As such, claims are still at the lowest level of the pandemic and are closing in on coming within one million from the March 2020 levels.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Con-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**\n\n&gt; While the most recent reading on continuing claims was lower, purely looking at regular state claims does not show the full picture. Including all other programs creates some additional lag meaning the most recent data is through the last week of July. Through that week, total claims fell below 12 million for the first time of the pandemic, totaling 11.76 million. Driving that decline were 79.9K and 66.08K declines in regular state and PEUC programs. The biggest decline came from the extended benefits program, though. That program saw claims get more than cut in half after a significant uptick the previous week. Throughout the month of July, claim counts for the extended benefits program were particularly volatile. They started off the month with a sub-100K reading of 98.4K, then rose all the way up to 343.5K, dropped to 239.6K, then rose again to 398.8K before falling back down to 177.9K in the week of July 30th.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Con-Jobless-Claims-NSA.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Con-Jobless-Claims-NSA-Share.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Homebuilder Sentiment: The Next Big Miss\n\n&gt; Prior to the pandemic, the NAHB's record monthly reading on homebuilder sentiment was back in December 1998 when the index hit 78. Last November, the sentiment bar was set even higher when the index reached 90. Since then, though, two-thirds of the releases have declined month over month. The most recent release saw the index drop five more points to 75, marking the first time in a year that homebuilder sentiment came in below the pre-pandemic record high. Additionally, August's 5-point drop is the largest one-month decline since last April when the index collapsed by a record 42 points at the onset of the pandemic. It is also tied with a dozen other months for the seventh-largest month-over-month decline in the history of the index going back to 1985.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-1a.png))**\n\n&gt; While the release indicates worsening, but still historically strong, sentiment among homebuilders, it can be added to the growing list of economic indicators that have been coming in well below expectations. As we noted in last week's Bespoke Report, Citi Surprise indices measuring how economic data comes in relative to estimates tipped into negative territory last week. That was as the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment survey saw the biggest miss relative to expectations on record. Today's reading on homebuilders was not far off those results. The five-point miss relative to expectations was the largest since last April and is tied with 4 other months (April and May 2006, November 2008, and October 2014) for the six largest miss going back to at least 2003.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-1b.png))**\n\n&gt; Driving the decline in the headline reading were five-point drops in present sales and traffic.

The Northeast and the West, on the other hand, are off of their peaks but each region did show an uptick in sentiment for August.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending August 20th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 8.22.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * (**T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/hV3LYS4.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/YupEtZ9.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S MARKET OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/bge25NW.png))**\n\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.23.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eKNfaOS.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.23.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Nsf4OKr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  8.24.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/xfr0NjU.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.24.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/5Ly7VHw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.25.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/OFpxuOX.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.25.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8uM0FGq.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.26.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/drMyySB.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.26.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7Hr5nKX.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.27.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RLkiAvx.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.27.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # JD.com, Inc. $63.62\n**JD.com, Inc.

        "selftext": "# Major US indices pulled back Friday, but not all that much. I believe we are almost at a tipping point for an after summer correction, which will pull down the market across the board, gearing up for a run into the holiday season.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1bcspupbkue71.png?width=864&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02a41e032419f26faad300dd4bb7390095aacc6e\n\n Only one alert triggered Friday and that was an $**ABNB** put.  After starting on this project, I believe that $**ABNB** is overvalued and doesn't have the sustainability that the current market price implies. Therefore, I've put in two put alerts. Go small.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ejhnm9agkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40397c1f5393200798dd4c6033b186b808f6d782\n\n A better positions that I would prefer is entering into a bigger put at the YTD VWAP. I have already set an alert for this stronger resistance, but there is no guarantee if and when it will reach it.  \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n#  Positions from Last Week\n\n**Ongoing** \t\t(I will consider cutting if Monday starts off red; still plenty of time left on)\n\n**$COIN** **-0.2%** (Shares)\n\n**$CAT -10%** (Calls)\n\n**$LOGI -7.2%** (Calls)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**New**\n\n**$ABNB +1.3%** (Puts)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### Closed\n\n**$TSLA +10% (**Closed)\n\n**$EBON +29%** (Closed)\n\n**$IRM +25%** (Closed)\n\n**$TSLA** \\+**117%** (Calls) \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n#  New and Adjusted Alerts \n\n $**HOOD** IPO'd last week and I will be waiting to enter at $10... (Just Kidding) I'm staying away from **Robinhood** for now.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j2n60j2pkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b8caa6b52af8d8929c9c14ba5553cd9a6df1037\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n After a great week with $**TSLA** calls, I've entered in another similar alert as the last two. If **Tesla** pulls back to the 50MA, I'll buy more calls. However, there is a chance that $**TSLA** keeps running next week therefore I am not interested in short term puts.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xusig0cqkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22d5c663bbebc6b93cb2bf8f818047304dcf42da\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n $**MT** is looking a little bit overbought, and even though I and many other analysts are bullish long term, I believe that this can be a good time to lock in some quick profits. Once it consolidates toward the 50MA, or even the YTD VWAP, we can re-enter with calls.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ju2q5ggrkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd9e8be9ff1955c146f200b161d86d67da242b7a\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I'm really liking $**CRM** going into August. The 180MA is approaching a large volume shelf that indicates a lot of buying will happen there. More so, the YTD VWAP is lurking at those levels as well. Long term bullish on **Salesforce**, and August is historically one of the best months for the stock. October or November calls, look tempting around the $230 level.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/udz6h6jskue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07559317d5d5618e74012c3ab7e3ae858b4b86db\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n$**TSM**, **Taiwan Semiconductor**, is, I believe, an undervalued company that has a fair price of around $130+. This is a great opportunity to pick up calls for November or EOY. September and October are some of the best months for **TSM** according to Trend Spider's Seasonality Chart. At current levels, the 50, 180, and a huge volume shelf are converging. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/21u9xyiukue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c03a9034effbf1c0594ba5aa34a48a6db2978b4\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n $**AXP** has had an amazing run this year August is one of the better months over the past decade. I believe consumer spending has and will increase and monthly calls or vertical spreads are perfect here.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jpgpa2hvkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c2b50116bebade25f92b68a5e8f9b4437295997\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **$AAP, Advance Auto Parts**, is still an interesting play for me. Everyone has probably heard by now that used car prices have gone up a lot. If we can get a consolidation around the 50MA, I think it is worth it to buy calls. However, I won't be waiting much longer for this one. I'll give it another week.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g655tlewkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0966c88748b44fd8f3317333e8233339c43c3644\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n $**VRT** also had a good week, up from the 50MA. I'm waiting for a resistance bounce to enter some short term puts.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r3kkaddxkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87d502222fa3701d87bf608c6284efa2dbc8fad2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I'm still waiting for **$X, US Steel**, to pull back to the 180ma. As you can see last it just came off a 180ma bounce, but not quite low enough to hit my trigger. I'm a patient man and I'll wait again. This is a good play going into October and November, so we have some time to enter.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/09oy8sgykue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea114b1ade318baa53487eac738ca13ff3002470\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **$AI** is to overhyped, and puts at upper resistance will pay significantly in my opinion. I've reupped the time on this alert and will wait for a bounce to enter.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/snkwzjizkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acdd5c9d6fa626471ff21cf572b84a84a18343c7\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n One of my favorite shorts is $**EBON**. Probably by now you know I have personal experience with this company. Sort them into the ground, please. This time the alert is set to trigger at the 50 MA and I'll go into a bigger position.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bgr3pqj0lue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20bef00a73ba2a1e68a0f2e2af0930cede9b9a95\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n $**ETSY** is next and the interesting thing about this stock, since its IPO, it has never had a positive October. I will be keeping this in mind when I buy calls at support. September usually is a good month. Getting in and out of this one is most likely the key.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/whhewch1lue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58fd6d95a96e7fb55d0089c593522f3863b47043\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n ^(Disclaimer: The comments opinions and analysis expressed herein are for informational and educational purpose only and should not be considered as individual advice or recommendations.)",

        "selftext": "I posted [my July earnings trading report](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/ov71vv/my_july_earnings_report/) last month, and many of you were kind enough to share your thoughts with me.\n\nTLDR: My July results were almost a scratch, $93 into a positive column, and I was undecided if trading earnings is a worthwhile thing.\n\nFast forward to the end of August\u2026 I couldn\u2019t keep away from earnings, just love trading them.\n\nHere are my August stats:\n\n* 21 earnings trades (short condors and strangles, all small positions, average BPu $532.85 per position)\n* 19 wins and 2 losses. A win rate - 90%. Better than July\u2019s 77%. A little experience helps!\n* My wins brought in $567.68\n* Losses took away $104.00\n* Net profit $463.68.\n\nWins: ABNB, BBY, CRM, CSCO, DASH, GPS, HPQ, INTU, M, MRVL, NVDA, PTON, SNOW, SPLK, TGT, TJX, ULTA, URBN, WDC\n\nLosses: LOW, JWN\n\nThe wins are great - no doubt. But it is the losses that are really interesting and have a high learning value. My losses show my indecision between two lines of thought: to defend a losing trade or to exit ASAP to minimize the loss. I have seen convincing arguments for both approaches, and am not yet sure where I stand on this.\n\nI managed my losing LOW trade fairly well in the beginning, brought it from several hundred down to around $30 loss. I could have brought it to a win, but I made a mistake - misread where I was standing and exited for a small loss. I learned how to read the position correctly and did another losing trade right - turned it into a win.\n\nI decided to take a loss on JWN because my overall win rate for August was around 93% and I thought I could afford a small loss. But now I think it could\u2019ve been managed and perhaps turned. But we\u2019ll never know if it could and if I had the skill to do it.\n\nWhere do you stand on this question? Do you defend? Or take a loss and move on to the next trade?",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 23rd, 2021.\n\n# **Fed officials will seek to avoid a tantrum as they keep \u2018taper talk\u2019 going at Jackson Hole - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/20/fed-officials-will-seek-to-avoid-a-tantrum-as-they-keep-taper-talk-going-at-jackson-hole.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts to reverse its easy policy will be a dominant theme for markets in the week ahead, as central bankers gather in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.\n*****\n&gt; The central bankers may even look relaxed against the backdrop of the Grand Tetons in the crisp late August air. But they will be under pressure to gently steer toward less policy support, without creating a market tantrum.\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve officials, in numerous recent speeches and interviews, have already managed to speed up expectations for when they could begin to slowly pare back their $120 billion a month in bond purchases. More of that talk is expected at their annual symposium, which begins Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed chairman\u2019s speech is typically the highlight of the annual event, and various Fed chairs have used Jackson Hole to send important messages. The question is whether Jerome Powell will channel his speech Friday morning to provide more details on how the Fed could begin to unwind its bond buying, and even whether he is personally ready to embrace it.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re not expecting a big policy reveal at this meeting,\u201d said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short strategy at Bank of America. \u201cI don\u2019t think Powell wants to front run the [September] meeting, given the myriad of voices that are out there. I don\u2019t think this is the time when Powell really wants to make a splash.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Besides the Fed, the week has a few economic reports. Existing home sales are released Monday; new home sales Tuesday and durable goods Wednesday. Friday has personal consumption expenditures data and the inflation index, closely watched by the Fed.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings are also expected from companies including Best Buy and Nordstrom on Tuesday, Salesforce.com on Wednesday and HP and Dell Technologies on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; # Fed and markets\nBut the Fed will matter most, as investors will also keep an eye on how the economy is responding to the spread of the Covid delta variant. Stocks were lower in the past week, with the S&amp;P 500 down 0.6%.\n*****\n&gt; There could be some volatility around the Fed\u2019s symposium, after the release this past Tuesday of minutes from the last official meeting rattled investors. The minutes described most members of the Federal Open Market Committee as being ready to taper this year if the economy is strong enough. Cabana said he changed his view after that release and now expects the Fed to begin paring back purchases in November, rather than January.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe just think this signal in communications is pretty clear,\u201d he said. \u201cFor now, it\u2019s safe to say they are wanting to start later this year, and we think the data will allow them to do that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; As for Powell, \u201che\u2019s not going to announce taper. What we anticipate is that he\u2019s going to give a live speech that talks about a lot of the progress that has been made since the start of Covid, and there\u2019s a lot of it,\u201d said Cabana. He said Powell could reiterate that the Fed will be data dependent in its decision to taper, and that many Fed officials believe it could make sufficient progress toward that goal later this year.\n*****\n&gt; The minutes caused hiccups in markets as investors reacted to the idea that the Fed will take its first steps toward peeling away the extraordinary amount of policy it used to fight the impact of the pandemic. Tapering the bond program could take months, but once it ends it could herald the onset of rate hikes.\n*****\n&gt; Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, said Powell should provide a road map for how the Fed will taper, but with the caveat of being able to step back if Covid becomes more serious than expected.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe asset purchases were initially to stabilize financial conditions. ... There\u2019s clearly a consensus building stronger than it even was at the last meeting in July, given how [Fed officials] have been speaking out since then,\u201d said Swonk. \u201cThey want to wind down asset purchases. As they wind them down, they\u2019re not hitting the brakes. They\u2019re only lifting their foot off the accelerator. The difference is important for [Powell] to lay out at Jackson Hole.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Swonk said the Fed needs to provide a road map for tapering, but also with off ramps in the event that Covid is worse than expected.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cTo avoid this becoming a tantrum and avoid financial markets seizing up again, he wants to get the messaging out and the context of it, as much as possible,\u201d Swonk said. \u201cIf this becomes a disorderly reaction and things are melting down, they would have to pivot. Where we\u2019re at is these types of purchases are no longer justified and may be detrimental in terms of how much liquidity they\u2019re putting into financial markets when its no longer needed.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/sxTwppT.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/XaZ3OqE.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/oLHqqFQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/iuH4ig1.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/lflLJO1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/7JLtvgO.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cnmvI5A.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Cqw6DkJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/QeyCpqJ.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/hV3LYS4.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wLwUeqE.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/4izjE1a.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/k1m7sYO.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # September Almanac: DJIA, S&amp;P 500 &amp; NASDAQ Worst Month of Year\n\n&gt; Start of the business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school once made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971), Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 (since 1979). After four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble buildup, S&amp;P 500 was down five Septembers straight from 1999-2003. In the 17 years since, S&amp;P 500 has advanced 11 times in September and declined six times.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/40afab5bf8a7d5d83f5c0df66416bd63/64275cde73d35d0e-b1/s400x600/f24c1395359fa121818eb1387e2f2cde70364a83.jpg))**\n\n&gt; In post-election years, September\u2019s overall rank improves modestly in post-election years going back to 1953 (third or fourth worst month depending on index). Average losses are little changed. Although September 2001 does influence the average declines, the fact remains DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have declined in 9 of the last 17 post-election year Septembers. Russell 2000 has the best post-election year record, up seven times in 10 years.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # US Dollar Breaks Out\n\n&gt; After roughly two months of declines, at the end of May the US dollar (proxied by Bloomberg's dollar index) found support around the lows from the first week of the year. Since then, the dollar has rallied 4.13%, moving back above its moving averages in the process which have also acted as support ever since. This week alone the dollar has gained 1.4%, and that upward move brings the dollar to the highest levels since early November and the early spring highs when the index stopped short of its 200-DMA.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082021-Dollar.png))**\n\n&gt; Taking a step back to look at the past five years, those lows that were reached earlier this spring and at the start of the year can actually be traced all the way back to early 2018 lows. Similarly, the recent highs that were taken out this week are around the same levels as the early 2016 lows. With the dollar now having broken out, it is no longer at the low end of that five-year range.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082021-Dollar-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # One of the Best Weeks of the Year for Claims\n\n&gt; Initial jobless claims hit another pandemic low this week dropping to 348K from last week's 2K upwardly revised reading of 377K. That was also 16K below expectations and the first better than expected print in six weeks. While recent releases have disappointed relative to forecasts, this week did mark the fourth week in a row that claims have dropped. That is the longest stretch of consecutive declines since a six-week streak ending on June 4th.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Initial-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**\n\n&gt; On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, initial claims fell to 308.57K which is again the lowest level since the start of the pandemic. Meanwhile, pandemic unemployment assistance claims ticked up to 109.38K from 103.85K the previous week. The main state driving that increase was Ohio which saw claims more than double. Maryland, Oregon, and California were the other states to have seen the biggest increase in PUA claims. Those increases also come even as the program is slated to end in just two weeks on September 4th.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Initial-Jobless-Claims-NSA.png))**\n\n&gt; As for the decline in claims for unadjusted regular state programs, we would caution against reading too deep into the number on account of strong seasonal tailwinds. As shown below, the current week of the year (33rd) is tied at second for the week of the year that most often sees claims decline. As shown in the second chart below, there has only been one year, last year, in which claims were higher week over week in the 33rd week of the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Initial-Jobless-Claims-Seasonal-1a.png))**\n\n&gt; Seasonally adjusted continuing claims missed expectations by 20K this week, but at 2.82 million, this week's reading still marked a third consecutive decline. As such, claims are still at the lowest level of the pandemic and are closing in on coming within one million from the March 2020 levels.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Con-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**\n\n&gt; While the most recent reading on continuing claims was lower, purely looking at regular state claims does not show the full picture. Including all other programs creates some additional lag meaning the most recent data is through the last week of July. Through that week, total claims fell below 12 million for the first time of the pandemic, totaling 11.76 million. Driving that decline were 79.9K and 66.08K declines in regular state and PEUC programs. The biggest decline came from the extended benefits program, though. That program saw claims get more than cut in half after a significant uptick the previous week. Throughout the month of July, claim counts for the extended benefits program were particularly volatile. They started off the month with a sub-100K reading of 98.4K, then rose all the way up to 343.5K, dropped to 239.6K, then rose again to 398.8K before falling back down to 177.9K in the week of July 30th.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Con-Jobless-Claims-NSA.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Con-Jobless-Claims-NSA-Share.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Homebuilder Sentiment: The Next Big Miss\n\n&gt; Prior to the pandemic, the NAHB's record monthly reading on homebuilder sentiment was back in December 1998 when the index hit 78. Last November, the sentiment bar was set even higher when the index reached 90. Since then, though, two-thirds of the releases have declined month over month. The most recent release saw the index drop five more points to 75, marking the first time in a year that homebuilder sentiment came in below the pre-pandemic record high. Additionally, August's 5-point drop is the largest one-month decline since last April when the index collapsed by a record 42 points at the onset of the pandemic. It is also tied with a dozen other months for the seventh-largest month-over-month decline in the history of the index going back to 1985.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-1a.png))**\n\n&gt; While the release indicates worsening, but still historically strong, sentiment among homebuilders, it can be added to the growing list of economic indicators that have been coming in well below expectations. As we noted in last week's Bespoke Report, Citi Surprise indices measuring how economic data comes in relative to estimates tipped into negative territory last week. That was as the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment survey saw the biggest miss relative to expectations on record. Today's reading on homebuilders was not far off those results. The five-point miss relative to expectations was the largest since last April and is tied with 4 other months (April and May 2006, November 2008, and October 2014) for the six largest miss going back to at least 2003.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-1b.png))**\n\n&gt; Driving the decline in the headline reading were five-point drops in present sales and traffic. Even though there has been deterioration in those readings on current conditions, future sales have held up better going unchanged at 81.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-3.png))**\n\n&gt; Looking across regions, the ones that have seen COVID cases rising the most of late, namely in the South and Midwest, generally saw sharp drops in homebuilder sentiment in August although those are in the context of longer-term declines. The Northeast and the West, on the other hand, are off of their peaks but each region did show an uptick in sentiment for August.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending August 20th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 8.22.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * (**T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/hV3LYS4.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/YupEtZ9.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S MARKET OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/bge25NW.png))**\n\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.23.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eKNfaOS.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.23.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Nsf4OKr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  8.24.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/xfr0NjU.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.24.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/5Ly7VHw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.25.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/OFpxuOX.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.25.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8uM0FGq.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.26.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/drMyySB.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.26.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7Hr5nKX.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.27.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RLkiAvx.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.27.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # JD.com, Inc. $63.62\n**JD.com, Inc.

        "selftext": "REDWOOD CITY, CA / ACCESSWIRE / August 16, 2021 / Biotricity, Inc. (OTCQB:BTCY), a medical diagnostic and consumer healthcare technology company, is pleased to provide financial results for its fiscal 2022 first quarter, which ended June 30, 2021. Full financial results will be posted on EDGAR later today. Biotricity's Q1 results maintain a trend of both sequential and year over year (YoY) growth, with revenue once again setting a new quarterly record. \n\nFor Q1 Fiscal 2022, management is noting the following highlights: \n   -- Q1 revenue of $1.76 million represented the 9th consecutive quarter of \n      triple digit YoY growth \n \n   -- Quarterly revenue increased 290% when comparing the first quarter of \n      fiscal 2022 to the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2021, showing \n      continued acceleration over the 227% growth in Q4/2021, 162% growth in \n      Q3/2021, and 115% growth in Q2/2021 \n \n   -- Quarterly sequential revenue increased 49% compared to 19% posted in the \n      prior quarter, a significant acceleration bolstered by consistent \n      month-over-month sequential growth \n \n   -- The Company nearly tripled sales with a smaller corresponding increase in \n      Operating Expenses, which rose only 17% to $4.2 million for Q1 FY22 \n      compared to $3.6 million in the prior year \n\n\"Continuous quarter over quarter revenue growth is a testament to our continued effort to expand our salesforce and footprint, stated Dr. Waqaas Al-Siddiq \"Our Technology as a Service (TaaS) model and highly competitive solution is attracting an increasing number of cardiologists to the Biotricity brand. We are still waiting to receive approval from the FDA for our Biotres holter product, which will give us a major new product to sell to our existing customers.\" \n\n\"Our operating expenses were only 7% higher than last year, despite a major ramp up in sales, which provides a good measure of the scalability of our business,\" said Biotricity's CFO, John Ayanoglou. \"While our year-over-year growth is increasing, our sequential quarterly growth is even more encouraging, coming it just shy of 50% in this quarter.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 23rd, 2021.\n\n# **Fed officials will seek to avoid a tantrum as they keep \u2018taper talk\u2019 going at Jackson Hole - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/20/fed-officials-will-seek-to-avoid-a-tantrum-as-they-keep-taper-talk-going-at-jackson-hole.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts to reverse its easy policy will be a dominant theme for markets in the week ahead, as central bankers gather in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.\n*****\n&gt; The central bankers may even look relaxed against the backdrop of the Grand Tetons in the crisp late August air. But they will be under pressure to gently steer toward less policy support, without creating a market tantrum.\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve officials, in numerous recent speeches and interviews, have already managed to speed up expectations for when they could begin to slowly pare back their $120 billion a month in bond purchases. More of that talk is expected at their annual symposium, which begins Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed chairman\u2019s speech is typically the highlight of the annual event, and various Fed chairs have used Jackson Hole to send important messages. The question is whether Jerome Powell will channel his speech Friday morning to provide more details on how the Fed could begin to unwind its bond buying, and even whether he is personally ready to embrace it.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re not expecting a big policy reveal at this meeting,\u201d said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short strategy at Bank of America. \u201cI don\u2019t think Powell wants to front run the [September] meeting, given the myriad of voices that are out there. I don\u2019t think this is the time when Powell really wants to make a splash.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Besides the Fed, the week has a few economic reports. Existing home sales are released Monday; new home sales Tuesday and durable goods Wednesday. Friday has personal consumption expenditures data and the inflation index, closely watched by the Fed.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings are also expected from companies including Best Buy and Nordstrom on Tuesday, Salesforce.com on Wednesday and HP and Dell Technologies on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; # Fed and markets\nBut the Fed will matter most, as investors will also keep an eye on how the economy is responding to the spread of the Covid delta variant. Stocks were lower in the past week, with the S&amp;P 500 down 0.6%.\n*****\n&gt; There could be some volatility around the Fed\u2019s symposium, after the release this past Tuesday of minutes from the last official meeting rattled investors. The minutes described most members of the Federal Open Market Committee as being ready to taper this year if the economy is strong enough. Cabana said he changed his view after that release and now expects the Fed to begin paring back purchases in November, rather than January.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe just think this signal in communications is pretty clear,\u201d he said. \u201cFor now, it\u2019s safe to say they are wanting to start later this year, and we think the data will allow them to do that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; As for Powell, \u201che\u2019s not going to announce taper. What we anticipate is that he\u2019s going to give a live speech that talks about a lot of the progress that has been made since the start of Covid, and there\u2019s a lot of it,\u201d said Cabana. He said Powell could reiterate that the Fed will be data dependent in its decision to taper, and that many Fed officials believe it could make sufficient progress toward that goal later this year.\n*****\n&gt; The minutes caused hiccups in markets as investors reacted to the idea that the Fed will take its first steps toward peeling away the extraordinary amount of policy it used to fight the impact of the pandemic. Tapering the bond program could take months, but once it ends it could herald the onset of rate hikes.\n*****\n&gt; Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, said Powell should provide a road map for how the Fed will taper, but with the caveat of being able to step back if Covid becomes more serious than expected.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe asset purchases were initially to stabilize financial conditions. ... There\u2019s clearly a consensus building stronger than it even was at the last meeting in July, given how [Fed officials] have been speaking out since then,\u201d said Swonk. \u201cThey want to wind down asset purchases. As they wind them down, they\u2019re not hitting the brakes. They\u2019re only lifting their foot off the accelerator. The difference is important for [Powell] to lay out at Jackson Hole.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Swonk said the Fed needs to provide a road map for tapering, but also with off ramps in the event that Covid is worse than expected.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cTo avoid this becoming a tantrum and avoid financial markets seizing up again, he wants to get the messaging out and the context of it, as much as possible,\u201d Swonk said. \u201cIf this becomes a disorderly reaction and things are melting down, they would have to pivot. Where we\u2019re at is these types of purchases are no longer justified and may be detrimental in terms of how much liquidity they\u2019re putting into financial markets when its no longer needed.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/sxTwppT.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/XaZ3OqE.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/oLHqqFQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/iuH4ig1.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/lflLJO1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/7JLtvgO.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cnmvI5A.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Cqw6DkJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/QeyCpqJ.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/hV3LYS4.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wLwUeqE.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/4izjE1a.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/k1m7sYO.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # September Almanac: DJIA, S&amp;P 500 &amp; NASDAQ Worst Month of Year\n\n&gt; Start of the business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school once made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971), Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 (since 1979). After four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble buildup, S&amp;P 500 was down five Septembers straight from 1999-2003. In the 17 years since, S&amp;P 500 has advanced 11 times in September and declined six times.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/40afab5bf8a7d5d83f5c0df66416bd63/64275cde73d35d0e-b1/s400x600/f24c1395359fa121818eb1387e2f2cde70364a83.jpg))**\n\n&gt; In post-election years, September\u2019s overall rank improves modestly in post-election years going back to 1953 (third or fourth worst month depending on index). Average losses are little changed. Although September 2001 does influence the average declines, the fact remains DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have declined in 9 of the last 17 post-election year Septembers. Russell 2000 has the best post-election year record, up seven times in 10 years.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # US Dollar Breaks Out\n\n&gt; After roughly two months of declines, at the end of May the US dollar (proxied by Bloomberg's dollar index) found support around the lows from the first week of the year. Since then, the dollar has rallied 4.13%, moving back above its moving averages in the process which have also acted as support ever since. This week alone the dollar has gained 1.4%, and that upward move brings the dollar to the highest levels since early November and the early spring highs when the index stopped short of its 200-DMA.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082021-Dollar.png))**\n\n&gt; Taking a step back to look at the past five years, those lows that were reached earlier this spring and at the start of the year can actually be traced all the way back to early 2018 lows. Similarly, the recent highs that were taken out this week are around the same levels as the early 2016 lows. With the dollar now having broken out, it is no longer at the low end of that five-year range.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082021-Dollar-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # One of the Best Weeks of the Year for Claims\n\n&gt; Initial jobless claims hit another pandemic low this week dropping to 348K from last week's 2K upwardly revised reading of 377K. That was also 16K below expectations and the first better than expected print in six weeks. While recent releases have disappointed relative to forecasts, this week did mark the fourth week in a row that claims have dropped. That is the longest stretch of consecutive declines since a six-week streak ending on June 4th.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Initial-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**\n\n&gt; On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, initial claims fell to 308.57K which is again the lowest level since the start of the pandemic. Meanwhile, pandemic unemployment assistance claims ticked up to 109.38K from 103.85K the previous week. The main state driving that increase was Ohio which saw claims more than double. Maryland, Oregon, and California were the other states to have seen the biggest increase in PUA claims. Those increases also come even as the program is slated to end in just two weeks on September 4th.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Initial-Jobless-Claims-NSA.png))**\n\n&gt; As for the decline in claims for unadjusted regular state programs, we would caution against reading too deep into the number on account of strong seasonal tailwinds. As shown below, the current week of the year (33rd) is tied at second for the week of the year that most often sees claims decline. As shown in the second chart below, there has only been one year, last year, in which claims were higher week over week in the 33rd week of the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Initial-Jobless-Claims-Seasonal-1a.png))**\n\n&gt; Seasonally adjusted continuing claims missed expectations by 20K this week, but at 2.82 million, this week's reading still marked a third consecutive decline. As such, claims are still at the lowest level of the pandemic and are closing in on coming within one million from the March 2020 levels.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Con-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**\n\n&gt; While the most recent reading on continuing claims was lower, purely looking at regular state claims does not show the full picture. Including all other programs creates some additional lag meaning the most recent data is through the last week of July. Through that week, total claims fell below 12 million for the first time of the pandemic, totaling 11.76 million. Driving that decline were 79.9K and 66.08K declines in regular state and PEUC programs. The biggest decline came from the extended benefits program, though. That program saw claims get more than cut in half after a significant uptick the previous week. Throughout the month of July, claim counts for the extended benefits program were particularly volatile. They started off the month with a sub-100K reading of 98.4K, then rose all the way up to 343.5K, dropped to 239.6K, then rose again to 398.8K before falling back down to 177.9K in the week of July 30th.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Con-Jobless-Claims-NSA.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Con-Jobless-Claims-NSA-Share.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Homebuilder Sentiment: The Next Big Miss\n\n&gt; Prior to the pandemic, the NAHB's record monthly reading on homebuilder sentiment was back in December 1998 when the index hit 78. Last November, the sentiment bar was set even higher when the index reached 90. Since then, though, two-thirds of the releases have declined month over month. The most recent release saw the index drop five more points to 75, marking the first time in a year that homebuilder sentiment came in below the pre-pandemic record high. Additionally, August's 5-point drop is the largest one-month decline since last April when the index collapsed by a record 42 points at the onset of the pandemic. It is also tied with a dozen other months for the seventh-largest month-over-month decline in the history of the index going back to 1985.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-1a.png))**\n\n&gt; While the release indicates worsening, but still historically strong, sentiment among homebuilders, it can be added to the growing list of economic indicators that have been coming in well below expectations. As we noted in last week's Bespoke Report, Citi Surprise indices measuring how economic data comes in relative to estimates tipped into negative territory last week. That was as the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment survey saw the biggest miss relative to expectations on record. Today's reading on homebuilders was not far off those results. The five-point miss relative to expectations was the largest since last April and is tied with 4 other months (April and May 2006, November 2008, and October 2014) for the six largest miss going back to at least 2003.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-1b.png))**\n\n&gt; Driving the decline in the headline reading were five-point drops in present sales and traffic. Even though there has been deterioration in those readings on current conditions, future sales have held up better going unchanged at 81.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-3.png))**\n\n&gt; Looking across regions, the ones that have seen COVID cases rising the most of late, namely in the South and Midwest, generally saw sharp drops in homebuilder sentiment in August although those are in the context of longer-term declines. The Northeast and the West, on the other hand, are off of their peaks but each region did show an uptick in sentiment for August.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending August 20th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 8.22.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * (**$JD $CRM $BBY $PTON $SNOW $XPEV $DKS $PDD $MDT $ANF $AAP $DG $EXPR $MRVL $ULTA $PANW $ITRN $DLTR $INTU $MSGE $MARK $COTY $WDAY $JWN $SPLK $CTRN $BURL $GPS $ADSK $MOMO $FLWS $BMO $URBN $BOX $SAFM $HPQ $HTHT $WSM $TOL $TD $BNS $DELL**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/hV3LYS4.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/YupEtZ9.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S MARKET OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/bge25NW.png))**\n\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.23.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eKNfaOS.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.23.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Nsf4OKr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  8.24.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/xfr0NjU.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.24.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/5Ly7VHw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.25.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/OFpxuOX.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.25.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8uM0FGq.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.26.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/drMyySB.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.26.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7Hr5nKX.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.27.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RLkiAvx.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.27.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # JD.com, Inc. $63.62\n**JD.com, Inc.

        "selftext": "REDWOOD CITY, CA / ACCESSWIRE / August 16, 2021 / Biotricity, Inc. (OTCQB:BTCY), a medical diagnostic and consumer healthcare technology company, is pleased to provide financial results for its fiscal 2022 first quarter, which ended June 30, 2021. Full financial results will be posted on EDGAR later today. Biotricity's Q1 results maintain a trend of both sequential and year over year (YoY) growth, with revenue once again setting a new quarterly record. \n\nFor Q1 Fiscal 2022, management is noting the following highlights: \n   -- Q1 revenue of $1.76 million represented the 9th consecutive quarter of \n      triple digit YoY growth \n \n   -- Quarterly revenue increased 290% when comparing the first quarter of \n      fiscal 2022 to the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2021, showing \n      continued acceleration over the 227% growth in Q4/2021, 162% growth in \n      Q3/2021, and 115% growth in Q2/2021 \n \n   -- Quarterly sequential revenue increased 49% compared to 19% posted in the \n      prior quarter, a significant acceleration bolstered by consistent \n      month-over-month sequential growth \n \n   -- The Company nearly tripled sales with a smaller corresponding increase in \n      Operating Expenses, which rose only 17% to $4.2 million for Q1 FY22 \n      compared to $3.6 million in the prior year \n\n\"Continuous quarter over quarter revenue growth is a testament to our continued effort to expand our salesforce and footprint, stated Dr. Waqaas Al-Siddiq \"Our Technology as a Service (TaaS) model and highly competitive solution is attracting an increasing number of cardiologists to the Biotricity brand. We are still waiting to receive approval from the FDA for our Biotres holter product, which will give us a major new product to sell to our existing customers.\" \n\n\"Our operating expenses were only 7% higher than last year, despite a major ramp up in sales, which provides a good measure of the scalability of our business,\" said Biotricity's CFO, John Ayanoglou. \"While our year-over-year growth is increasing, our sequential quarterly growth is even more encouraging, coming it just shy of 50% in this quarter. As we have discussed in recent quarters, with multiple new products on the horizon, R&amp;D spending continues to be strategically high, coming in at nearly $590,000 for the quarter, a 39% increase over the prior year.\" \n\nBased on current trends, the Company is projecting continued revenue growth for fiscal 2022 and into fiscal 2023. As a reminder, Biotricity filed a 510(K) seeking FDA approval for its new Biotres holter product on December 31, 2020 and is prepared for a fast launch following that approval. Although the approval process has been slowed somewhat by the widely reported FDA backlog, the process is otherwise on track in terms of the steps required of the Company. \n\nConference Call Information \n\nBiotricity management will host a conference call and live webcast on August 16, 2021 at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time (4:30 p.m. Eastern Time) to discuss the company's financial results. \n\nTo access the live call, dial +1 334-777-6978 (local) or 800-367-2403 (toll free) and give the participant passcode 7356128. \n\nA live webcast of the conference call can be accessed by clicking on the following link: Webcast Audio will stream through your selected device.

The ARA has a PAC named the Repo Alliance. Repo Alliance has been facing an uphill battle against the CFPB about requiring NMLS standards for all repossession employees and skip tracers. This business model will not work for KAR Global because a person in Indiana or India isn't going to be able to call a California consumer or broker a repossession again.\n\nNo VIN pipeline, no revenue for ancillary repossession services, and auction fees.

        "selftext": " \n\nHello investors,\n\nI am posting a revised version for clarification purposes.\n\nIn every stock analysis, there should be three key components.\n\n1. Durable competitive advantage\n2. Financial Analysis\n3. Valuation\n\nIn this post, I will be going over the first of the three: Identifying durable competitive advantage, which I would argue is the most important one out of the three because a company's financials and valuations are simply reflections of a company's competitive advantage.\n\nI've been noticing that a lot of people are leaving out some very important components to a stock analysis or taking big leaps in assumptions.\n\nFor instance, many people nowadays seem to be making premature conclusions along the lines of\n\n\"the US government is pushing for clean energy initiatives and therefore, Tesla stock will be going up\" or\n\n\"Amazon reported sales growth of 40% so the stock is a buy\" or\n\n\"Apple makes great phones and therefore, Apple stock is a great investment\".\n\nIf you've noticed, these statements are taking big leaps in assumptions. There are many factors that go into an investment decision and we need to think from multiple angles, not just a one-dimensional level such as \"Apple is introducing a new line of products and thus, Apple stock is a buy.\" We need a more in-depth analysis.\n\nI think the best way to learn is to take a look at an example analysis. This is an example copy of a one-pager stock pitch that covers all three elements: competitive advantage, financials, and valuation. For those who'd like a copy of this sample pitch please sign up to the email distribution list below and you'll receive a copy.\n\nA competitive advantage is when a company has an edge over its competitors. Most people would subscribe to Neflix over renting DVDs because it's much easier and cheaper to stream on Neflix than renting $10 DVDs. This is called competitive advantage.\n\nFor instance, a lemonade stand may have a competitive advantage over an orange juice stand because it can make lemonades at a cheaper cost than the orange juice stand.\n\nA Google's search engine has a competitive advantage over Microsoft's Edge due to the superior search algorithm and network effect.\n\nA durable competitive advantage is a company's edge that is a lasting one.\n\nTo use the previous examples, can the lemonade stand continue to produce lemonades at cheaper cost than orange juice stand?\n\nIs Google able to maintain its superior search algorithm and the network effect over time?\n\nA company with a durable competitive advantage is the one whose stock price will grow over time.\n\nIf a company's business model does not have a durable competitive advantage, it won't survive for the long-term, no matter how cheap you can buy it.\n\nIt's sort of like buying a company that produces flip phones. Remember these? Sure you could be buying this company at a bargain P/E of 3x but is it really a bargain? It produces an outdated device with no real competitive advantage over other products and therefore, it won't see any type of growth and its stock price will cater.\n\nBlackberry also may had a competitive advantage at some point and that's why it became so widely used.\n\nBut the advantage didn't last for long and it turns out the competitive advantage was not a durable one.\n\nEvery company you look at should have a clear, durable competitive advantage.\n\nFor instance, what's to keep Thor Industries, the largest manufacturer of recreational vehicles, to operate competitively?\n\nBecause it has the largest and most efficient manufacturing plants and largest dealership network in the world. There is a high barrier-to-entry for any new entrants to compete. Management has been known to be great capital allocators, meaning they know when to issue debt to build a new manufacturing plant, acquire a business, or buy back its own stock.\n\nThese points back up the claim that Thor has a durable competitive advantage and will keep the business growing.\n\nMy favorite way of identifying this edge is to try the product or service because a customer is usually the best judge of a value. You could easily try Starbucks, Shake Shack, and many other products from consumer companies.\n\nFor those that are business-facing like Salesforce, you can find surveys or product usages.\n\nMost of the times, however, a great product/service will always show traction in the early stages.\n\nAmazon, Facebook, and PayPal were gaining 200% new users every year in its early days.\n\nAmerican Express had a crazy growth in its early years as well.\n\nTake Upstart for example. And this is one of my favorite companies at the moment because it's in the sweet spot of growth and valuation.\n\nIt's growing sales at +90% clip yoy, that compares to avg 15% growth for its peer companies.\n\nWithout even testing out their product, I know something is working right with the products it's offering, as evidenced by the sales growth.\n\nOne important thing to be mindful of is that sometimes these growth can be non-organic, meaning the growth can be a result of acquisitions or aggressive marketing spending.\n\nIf you are growing your sales at 70% yoy but your user growth is only 40% yoy, that is a bad sign.\n\nAlternatively, if you are giving excessive concessions that your economics doesn't make sense, that's also an issue.\n\nFor instance, remember Moviepass? They were charging $10/month to watch an unlimited number of movies. While the user growth was exceptional, this model was clearly unsustainable and we should be wary of these kinds of business models.\n\nThe bottom line is that whenever you are looking to buy a stock of a company, the company should always have a durable competitive advantage in order for its stock to 10x in the next 5-10 years.\n\nPlease check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad89G90NUzQ) on YouTube for a better-explained version and check out [r/Midasinvestors](https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/) for steps 2 and 3!\n\nThank you all for reading and happy investing!",

        "selftext": "REDWOOD CITY, CA / ACCESSWIRE / August 16, 2021 / Biotricity, Inc. (OTCQB:BTCY), a medical diagnostic and consumer healthcare technology company, is pleased to provide financial results for its fiscal 2022 first quarter, which ended June 30, 2021. Full financial results will be posted on EDGAR later today. Biotricity's Q1 results maintain a trend of both sequential and year over year (YoY) growth, with revenue once again setting a new quarterly record. \n\nFor Q1 Fiscal 2022, management is noting the following highlights: \n   -- Q1 revenue of $1.76 million represented the 9th consecutive quarter of \n      triple digit YoY growth \n \n   -- Quarterly revenue increased 290% when comparing the first quarter of \n      fiscal 2022 to the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2021, showing \n      continued acceleration over the 227% growth in Q4/2021, 162% growth in \n      Q3/2021, and 115% growth in Q2/2021 \n \n   -- Quarterly sequential revenue increased 49% compared to 19% posted in the \n      prior quarter, a significant acceleration bolstered by consistent \n      month-over-month sequential growth \n \n   -- The Company nearly tripled sales with a smaller corresponding increase in \n      Operating Expenses, which rose only 17% to $4.2 million for Q1 FY22 \n      compared to $3.6 million in the prior year \n\n\"Continuous quarter over quarter revenue growth is a testament to our continued effort to expand our salesforce and footprint, stated Dr. Waqaas Al-Siddiq \"Our Technology as a Service (TaaS) model and highly competitive solution is attracting an increasing number of cardiologists to the Biotricity brand. We are still waiting to receive approval from the FDA for our Biotres holter product, which will give us a major new product to sell to our existing customers.\" \n\n\"Our operating expenses were only 7% higher than last year, despite a major ramp up in sales, which provides a good measure of the scalability of our business,\" said Biotricity's CFO, John Ayanoglou. \"While our year-over-year growth is increasing, our sequential quarterly growth is even more encouraging, coming it just shy of 50% in this quarter. As we have discussed in recent quarters, with multiple new products on the horizon, R&amp;D spending continues to be strategically high, coming in at nearly $590,000 for the quarter, a 39% increase over the prior year.\" \n\nBased on current trends, the Company is projecting continued revenue growth for fiscal 2022 and into fiscal 2023. As a reminder, Biotricity filed a 510(K) seeking FDA approval for its new Biotres holter product on December 31, 2020 and is prepared for a fast launch following that approval. Although the approval process has been slowed somewhat by the widely reported FDA backlog, the process is otherwise on track in terms of the steps required of the Company. \n\nConference Call Information \n\nBiotricity management will host a conference call and live webcast on August 16, 2021 at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time (4:30 p.m. Eastern Time) to discuss the company's financial results. \n\nTo access the live call, dial +1 334-777-6978 (local) or 800-367-2403 (toll free) and give the participant passcode 7356128. \n\nA live webcast of the conference call can be accessed by clicking on the following link: Webcast Audio will stream through your selected device.

The Company has limited its patent monetization activities due to the ongoing negotiations. If the Company had not been in negotiations during the quarter, we believe that Licensing revenue would have been higher.\n\nThis came four months after IAM had broken the news that such a sale was being considered by the Canadian telecoms business.\n\nSince that March announcement, though, and the contents of a 10K release, there has been very little public or, indeed, private comment on the state of play in how the transaction negotiations are panning out.\n\nSo, while it was known that the possible deal was with a North American entity and involved that part of BlackBerry\u2019s 38,000-strong portfolio of patents \u201crelating primarily to non-core or legacy mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking technologies\u201d, there was no mention of a price, the stage the negotiations had reached or the identity of the possible buyer.\n\nInevitably, rumour finds its way into such a knowledge vacuum. Over recent months, IAM has heard all manner of things, including, most often of all, that the deal is going nowhere because the parties are so far apart on pricing; or, alternatively, that a deal is imminent and involves a single, big, Silicon Valley tech player, possibly Facebook.\n\nOur understanding, though, is that neither of these \u2013 or the many other stories doing the rounds \u2013 are correct. Instead, although parties close to the negotiations are staying tight-lipped, we believe that things are reaching a conclusion, to the extent that an agreement could be announced around the time BlackBerry releases its FY 2022 Q2 financials towards the end of September.\n\nThe pricing has been more or less agreed, and the numbers are material. Meanwhile, the buyer is actually a group of entities that have been negotiating without an intermediary. That has created a level of complexity around the deal structure which explains why it is taking so long to finalise.\n\nHowever, while there may be an announcement in the last week of next month, closure will take longer as the deal is going to require clearance from regulatory authorities in at least two countries: Canada and the US. If everything goes well, though, the sale will be signed, sealed and delivered by the end of this year.\n\nNote \u2013 the above is not definitive, it could be wrong in places. However, what IAM is confident in saying is that the deal is progressing, pricing is not an issue, the potential buyer is not a single company and the aim is to go public with an agreement on or around the day that BlackBerry announces its next set of financials towards the end of September.\n\nFamous last words!\"\n\n**Facebook want to use \"Blackberry Secure\" to bring WhatsApp Messenger to the Enterprise.

It is a pure cloud solution (vs on premise), that allows quick and seamless implementations. It was founded in 1998 and is being led by one of the co-founders.\n\nCompetitive advantages\n\nLivevox currently dominates the regulated collections/ outbound niche, which allows users to make calls remaining TCPA compliant. The platform is called HCI (Human Call Initiator) and is basically an automated software that is manual enough to meet regulatory rules. It is cheap to deploy (around $50k over 3 weeks vs $500k over 6 months estimated cost of other vendors) and can be integrated with other vendors, which makes a no-brainer buy even having other platforms for the Inbound segment. Nobody is and reliability of the solution. \n\nThe company currently serves just 10% of the workers of the companies where it is providing its services; this should be taken as an advantage having a foot in the door and being able to expand services.\n\nStrategic mistakes being corrected\n\nLeadership failed to correctly address the go-to-market strategy, just focusing on the product while skipping any marketing investment in advisory companies like Gartner and avoiding distributors. That allowed competitors to gain market share while having an inferior and more expensive product, just because the company was not listed in a  quadrant or no consultant would provide feedback about Livevox capabilities; we all know the incentives of decision makers within big corporations that want to back CAPEX decisions with consultant reports. This error is being corrected and they\u2019re currently spending, not just in consultant reports (Forrester), but also in distribution partners like Telarus and Intelisys, with real sales ramping up to 10% of new bookings.\n\nRevenue, gross margins and other metrics\n\nRevenue is comprised of recurring subscription revenue and professional services. The subscription revenue has two components:  minimum usage and revenue in excess of the minimum value.\n\nThird quarter results:\n\n1. Total revenue = $28.9m\n   1. Total subscription revenue = $28.3m\n      1. Usage revenue contract = $22.4m\n      2. Usage above minimum contract = $6m\n   2. Professional services = $0,578m\n\nPre-merge revenue guidance = $128m\n\nCurrent revenue guidance = $118m\n\nMain highlight is the reduction of the usage above minimum contract due to the negative impact of the direct financial stimulus in the collection business.\n\nGross margins 61.7%\n\nLTM Net retention revenue rate = 105% (118% pre-COVID in 2019)\n\nRemaining performance obligations (contracted revenue) add up to $142m over the next 61 months and do not include additional usage in excess of contractual minimum commitments.\n\nwhereas the other co-founder also remains also in a board position.\n\nSecular Tailwinds\n\nThere is a shift to underpenetrated cloud CCaaS providers. McKinsey reports a $27b TAM in 2020 with $50b incremental opportunity over next 10 years. The market is evolving from voice-centric to omnichannel, analytics and AI (basically response automation through workflows that can be triggered by certain inputs). \n\nBackground, why this opportunity exists and valuation\n\nLivevox became a public company after merging with SPAC Crescent Acquisition Corp. The SPAC previously failed to merge with F45 (fitness franchisor); the company was decent and says about the quality of the companies being targeted.\n\nIn order to pull the merger off, Crescent had to renounce 7m warrants ($10m), 2.7m shares ($27m) and screw 2.7m shares that can only be vested if price increases to $12.5, 15 and 17.5. Apart from that, $75m PIPE investment was raised as well as $25m forward purchase agreement.\n\nFinally most of SPACs shareholders decided to redeem capital and left the trust account with just $98m (from $250m!). Due to redemptions Golden Gate (main private equity shareholder) renounced to $32m that would have otherwise been payable as cash and were paid in equity at $10 per share.\n\nI think, in order to raise SPACs funds, managers provided a too optimistic guidance -even with the data that revenue from usage above minimum contract was not performing well-; the revenue impact in the annualized figures was almost $11m.\n\nPre-merger Livevox was EBITDA positive since 2014, now due to the expansion of internal sales and marketing teams, it is EBITDA negative. Taking into account recurrent revenue, operating leverage of CSaas model, a 105% revenue retention rate, a target 25% revenue growth and further upside of the revenue above minimum, it should not be difficult to beat estimates. Five9, a well known competitor, was acquired at a 21x revenue (amount paid in shares). Therefore, LIVEVOX seems undervalued and could be trading at least at a 8x revenue.\n\nShare price            Fully diluted shares \n\n$10    95.2m\n\n$12.5    95.7m\n\n$14    101.1m\n\n$16    106.3m\n\nCash = $161.5m\n\nDebt = $62.5\n\nMarket Cap (share price $6.3) = $600m\n\nEV= $500m\n\nEV / R ($118m)= 4.23\n\nTarget Price (8x revenue  current guidance) =&gt; Market cap $845m or $11 share price.\n\nRisks\n\nHaving the proper information, Livevox did not release an accurate pre-merger guidance as they wanted to raise as much capital as possible inflating figures. The market has turned negative and skeptic about future guidance.\n\nHCI is an awesome product that bypasses regulation. This is a well known feature by the regulator that could trigger an amendment. Regulatory risk is real and continuously changing (that could be seen also as a feature).\n\nFierce competition (Five9, Nice, Genesys, RingCentral) \n\nBusinessPhone.com acquisition ($7m) did not materially translate into an increase in revenue, and it could be a hint about the product, that is not so sticky and recurrent as I thought.\n\nGolden Gate could be listing Livevox as a last resource to grow the company.\n\nCatalyst\n\nSuccess in the go-to-market strategy increasing logos and expanding current ones.\n\nNormalization in the revenue above minimum usage as fourth stimulus checks are unlikely.\n\nCOVID has accelerated the work-from-home trend and cloud technology is well positioned to take advantage. \n\nManagers and spac incentives are aligned with shareholders and equity incentives can be released if a certain stock performance is met ($12.5 ; $15 ; $17.5). There is no incentive to lie as the company is already public and  all the workers are part of the equity incentive program. \n\nAll or part of this factors could trigger a re-rate of the company at a closer to peers EV/R multiple",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, August 23, 2021**\n\nStocks rebounded today, rising to fresh records after last week\u2019s volatility as fears surrounding a potential taper timeline, as alluded by the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest meeting minute, receded. Like I said last week, I viewed the dip following the meeting minutes as another overreaction by the market. To reiterate, I remain very bullish moving forward until the Federal Reserve starts to discuss a potential interest rate hike, which I expect in late 2022-early 2023. Looking ahead, market participants wait for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s annual Jackson Hole speech on Thursday. In my opinion, he likely will not reveal any additional details regarding a potential taper timeline in order to avoid another taper tantrum. ([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp#:\\~:text=Taper%20tantrum%20refers%20to%20the,quantitative%20easing%20(QE)%20program](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp#:~:text=Taper%20tantrum%20refers%20to%20the,quantitative%20easing%20(QE)%20program)).\n\nLast week, equities came under pressure after the Fed\u2019s July meeting minutes, which said \u201clooking ahead, most participants noted that, provided that the economy were to evolve broadly as anticipated, they judged it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year.\u201dAs I said above, this makes a lot of sense judging how the economy has also so far rebounded at a faster pace than expected. Given this record-breaking quarter in terms of corporate earnings and improving labor market conditions, the economy is beginning to be able to stand on its own without all the pandemic-era support. However, while progress has been made, the Fed\u2019s goal has not yet been reached. The meeting minutes said, \u201c most participants judged that the Committee\u2019s standard of \u201csubstantial further progress\u201d toward the maximum-employment goal had not yet been met.\u201d \n\nIn order to stave off another \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d and directly address interest rates concerns, the minutes explicitly stressed the need to \u201creaffirm the absence of any mechanical link between the timing of tapering and that of an eventual increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.\u201d Participants voted to maintain the interest rate near zero. I cannot stress this enough, potential interest rate hikes in 2023 will be the real test for equities.\n\n[https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210728.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210728.pdf)\n\nThis earnings season has been a smashing, record-breaking success. 91% of companies in the SPY have reported, with 87% of those outperforming estimates in revenue. The blended, year-over-year earnings growth rate is an eye-popping 85.1%, absolutely smashing original estimates of 66.5%. What is most remarkable is this comes among a resurgence of coronavirus cases due to the delta variant, supply-side disruptions, and labor market imbalances in the US. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The US Federal Drug Association (FDA) officially approved Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech\u2019s (BNTX) coronavirus vaccine. Until now, it was administered under emergency use authorization. Moderna\u2019s vaccine is likely to be approved in the next few days as well. Stock of vaccine-makers were higher. \n* Shares of cancer-research company Trillium Therapeutics (TRIL) were up 188% after Pfizer (PFE) acquired them for $2.26 billion. Andy Schmeltz, President of Pfizer Oncology said, \u201cThe proposed acquisition of Trillium builds on our strong track record of leadership in Oncology, enhancing our hematology portfolio as we strive to improve outcomes for people living with blood cancers around the globe\u201d.\n* Existing home sales unexpectedly rose in July, marking consecutive monthly gains. According to the National Association of Realtors, existing home sales rose 2%, compared to a 0.5% dip expected. \n* Ford Motors (F) has doubled its production target for the new F-150 Lightning pick-up truck due to strong early demand. The company now has a target of producing 80,000 in 2024, up from its previous target of 40,000.\n* Target (TGT) announced it planned to triple the number of Disney (DIS) shops within its stores by year's end. Target started hosting these Disney \u201cshop in a shop\u201d locations in 2019.\n* Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit said Boeing Co. will invest in the satellite-launching startup's planned $3.2 billion merger-listing later this year, an investment that comes as the plane maker's own space program faces hurdles. Shares of Virgin Galactic (SPCE) are still reeling following Branson\u2019s flight a few weeks ago.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* AbbVie (ABBV) target raised by Cowen from $120 to $130 at Outperform. Stock currently around $120\n* Abbott Labs (ABT) target raised by Cowen from $125 to $140 at Outperform. Stock currently around $126\n* Albemarle (ALB) target raised by Loop Capital from $208 to $253 at Buy. Stock currently around $228\n* Burlington Stores (BURL) target raised by Telsey Advisory Group from $380 to $400 at Outperform. Stock currently around $343\n* Salesforce (CRM) target raised by Barclays from $285 to $291 at Overweight. Stock currently around $260\n* John Deere (DE) target raised by Credit Suisse from $430 to $440 at Outperform. Stock currently around $362\n* Intuit (INTU) with two target raises. Stock currently around $553\n   * Jefferies Financial from $525 to $630 at Buy\n   * Barclays from $540 to $645 at Overweight\n* MongoDB (MDB) target raised by Deutsche Bank from $390 to $420 at Overweight.

However one might not suspect the underlying cost associated with the open source software, as the open source CRM will only provide the basic framework. And the rets of the components are to be found with in house solutions.\n\nAt a first glance the overhead costs might not look as significant, but when you start considering hiring a design team to provide UI/UX design solutions, a technical team with the required knowhow to build up on the open source platform and help realise the specs provided by the design tem, a customer support team and a tech support team. The costs are overwhelmingly huge. And the economic boon will start to look like a bane.

        "selftext": "Hello investors,\n\nI am posting a revised version for clarification purposes. \n\nIn every stock analysis, there should be three key components.  \n\n\n1. Durable competitive advantage  \n2. Financial Analysis  \n3. Valuation  \n   \nIn this post, I will be going over the first of the three: Identifying durable competitive advantage, which I would argue is the most important one out of the three because a company's financials and valuations are simply reflections of a company's competitive advantage.  \n\n\nI've been noticing that a lot of people are leaving out some very important components to a stock analysis or taking big leaps in assumptions.  \n\n\nFor instance, many people nowadays seem to be making premature conclusions along the lines of  \n\n\n\"the US government is pushing for clean energy initiatives and therefore, Tesla stock will be going up\" or  \n\n\n\"Amazon reported sales growth of 40% so the stock is a buy\" or  \n\n\n\"Apple makes great phones and therefore, Apple stock is a great investment\".  \n\n\nIf you've noticed, these statements are taking big leaps in assumptions. There are many factors that go into an investment decision and we need to think from multiple angles, not just a one-dimensional level such as \"Apple is introducing a new line of products and thus, Apple stock is a buy.\" We need a more in-depth analysis.  \n\n\nI think the best way to learn is to take a look at an example analysis. This is an example copy of a one-pager stock pitch that covers all three elements: competitive advantage, financials, and valuation. For those who'd like a copy of this sample pitch please sign up to the email distribution list below and you'll receive a copy.  \n\n\nA competitive advantage is when a company has an edge over its competitors. Most people would subscribe to Neflix over renting DVDs because it's much easier and cheaper to stream on Neflix than renting $10 DVDs. This is called competitive advantage.  \n\n\nFor instance, a lemonade stand may have a competitive advantage over an orange juice stand because it can make lemonades at a cheaper cost than the orange juice stand.   \n   \nA Google's search engine has a competitive advantage over Microsoft's Edge due to the superior search algorithm and network effect.   \n   \nA durable competitive advantage is a company's edge that is a lasting one.   \n   \nTo use the previous examples, can the lemonade stand continue to produce lemonades at cheaper cost than orange juice stand?   \n   \nIs Google able to maintain its superior search algorithm and the network effect over time?  \n   \nA company with a durable competitive advantage is the one whose stock price will grow over time.  \n\n\nIf a company's business model does not have a durable competitive advantage, it won't survive for the long-term, no matter how cheap you can buy it.  \n   \nIt's sort of like buying a company that produces flip phones. Remember these? Sure you could be buying this company at a bargain P/E of 3x but is it really a bargain? It produces an outdated device with no real competitive advantage over other products and therefore, it won't see any type of growth and its stock price will cater.  \n   \nBlackberry also may had a competitive advantage at some point and that's why it became so widely used.  \n\n\nBut the advantage didn't last for long and it turns out the competitive advantage was not a durable one.  \n\n\nEvery company you look at should have a clear, durable competitive advantage.  \n\n\nFor instance, what's to keep Thor Industries, the largest manufacturer of recreational vehicles, to operate competitively?  \n\n\nBecause it has the largest and most efficient manufacturing plants and largest dealership network in the world. There is a high barrier-to-entry for any new entrants to compete. Management has been known to be great capital allocators, meaning they know when to issue debt to build a new manufacturing plant, acquire a business, or buy back its own stock.  \n\n\nThese points back up the claim that Thor has a durable competitive advantage and will keep the business growing.  \n\n\nMy favorite way of identifying this edge is to try the product or service because a customer is usually the best judge of a value. You could easily try Starbucks, Shake Shack, and many other products from consumer companies.  \n   \nFor those that are business-facing like Salesforce, you can find surveys or product usages.   \n   \nMost of the times, however, a great product/service will always show traction in the early stages.  \n   \nAmazon, Facebook, and PayPal were gaining 200% new users every year in its early days.  \n   \nAmerican Express had a crazy growth in its early years as well.  \n   \nTake Upstart for example. And this is one of my favorite companies at the moment because it's in the sweet spot of growth and valuation.  \n   \nIt's growing sales at +90% clip yoy, that compares to avg 15% growth for its peer companies.  \n   \nWithout even testing out their product, I know something is working right with the products it's offering, as evidenced by the sales growth.  \n   \nOne important thing to be mindful of is that sometimes these growth can be non-organic, meaning the growth can be a result of acquisitions or aggressive marketing spending.  \n   \nIf you are growing your sales  at 70% yoy but your user growth is only 40% yoy, that is a bad sign.  \n   \nAlternatively, if you are giving excessive concessions that your economics doesn't make sense, that's also an issue.   \n\n\nFor instance, remember Moviepass? They were charging $10/month to watch an unlimited number of movies. While the user growth was exceptional, this model was clearly unsustainable and we should be wary of these kinds of business models.  \n\n\nThe bottom line is that whenever you are looking to buy a stock of a company, the company should always have a durable competitive advantage in order for its stock to 10x in the next 5-10 years. \n\nPlease check out this [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUDMvU3Ne27KA07rgopJnww) on YouTube for a better-explained version and check out r/Midasinvestors for steps 2 and 3!\n\nThank you all for reading and happy investing!",

        "selftext": "The year 2020 saw a series of black swan events which shot up the liquidity of the market accross the world. Which rallied a plethora of new retail brokers keen on trading from home. Under the new conditions, the need for CRMs grew as well. So if you are among the people who are lining up to get your hands on a CRM. Make sure you keep in mind these requirements, atleast, before you buy one.\n\n1. Inter device compatibility, it has been estimated that about 85% of brokerages provide either a mobile application or a variant of it to their user to be used on the go. Needless to say that it is becoming an industry standard.\n2. Cross Platform compatibility, the traders of today are not content with just the plain old MT$, some demand MT5 and other platforms like cTrader as well. \n3. Simple yet tangible and functional UI/UX. I dont think i have to stress upon the absolute importance of it, a well designed interface in itself can help you attract new customers and reduce your overhead on signing up a new consumer.\n\nIf anyone amongst you are seriously considering getting a CRM for your firm, I recommend checking out this report compiled in the link below. \n\nhttps://www.fazzaco.com/category/forexcrm",

        "selftext": "It is universally accepted that owning and operating an independent CRM is the natural career wise succession for a successful IB. An introducing broker with a pre-existing clientele can successfully migrate them to either an \u2018White Label\u2019 or a \u2018Grey Label\u2019 CRM platform. \n\nThis essentially translates to a higher profit margin as your CRM will be directly dealing with the big banks and the liquidity providers for the trades executed  by your clientell. However this does come with its own associated complexities and risks. \n\nFor someone loitering with the idea of starting their own brokerage, it is highly recommended that one starts out with a Grey Label CRM/ As that is an economically more viable and justified investment for an individual.\n\nThere are for sure a host of factors to keep in mind before starting out. Solutions to which can be found out in the internet. However i am linking this special report on CRM for people who are curious.\n\nhttps://www.fazzaco.com/category/forexcrm",

        "selftext": "Hello investors,\n\nI am posting a revised version for clarification purposes.\n\nIn every stock analysis, there should be three key components.\n\n1. Durable competitive advantage\n2. Financial Analysis\n3. Valuation\n\nIn this post, I will be going over the first of the three: Identifying durable competitive advantage, which I would argue is the most important one out of the three because a company's financials and valuations are simply reflections of a company's competitive advantage.\n\nI've been noticing that a lot of people are leaving out some very important components to a stock analysis or taking big leaps in assumptions.\n\nFor instance, many people nowadays seem to be making premature conclusions along the lines of\n\n\"the US government is pushing for clean energy initiatives and therefore, Tesla stock will be going up\" or\n\n\"Amazon reported sales growth of 40% so the stock is a buy\" or\n\n\"Apple makes great phones and therefore, Apple stock is a great investment\".\n\nIf you've noticed, these statements are taking big leaps in assumptions. There are many factors that go into an investment decision and we need to think from multiple angles, not just a one-dimensional level such as \"Apple is introducing a new line of products and thus, Apple stock is a buy.\" We need a more in-depth analysis.\n\nI think the best way to learn is to take a look at an example analysis. This is an example copy of a one-pager stock pitch that covers all three elements: competitive advantage, financials, and valuation. For those who'd like a copy of this sample pitch please sign up to the email distribution list below and you'll receive a copy.\n\nA competitive advantage is when a company has an edge over its competitors. Most people would subscribe to Neflix over renting DVDs because it's much easier and cheaper to stream on Neflix than renting $10 DVDs. This is called competitive advantage.\n\nFor instance, a lemonade stand may have a competitive advantage over an orange juice stand because it can make lemonades at a cheaper cost than the orange juice stand.\n\nA Google's search engine has a competitive advantage over Microsoft's Edge due to the superior search algorithm and network effect.\n\nA durable competitive advantage is a company's edge that is a lasting one.\n\nTo use the previous examples, can the lemonade stand continue to produce lemonades at cheaper cost than orange juice stand?\n\nIs Google able to maintain its superior search algorithm and the network effect over time?\n\nA company with a durable competitive advantage is the one whose stock price will grow over time.\n\nIf a company's business model does not have a durable competitive advantage, it won't survive for the long-term, no matter how cheap you can buy it.\n\nIt's sort of like buying a company that produces flip phones. Remember these? Sure you could be buying this company at a bargain P/E of 3x but is it really a bargain? It produces an outdated device with no real competitive advantage over other products and therefore, it won't see any type of growth and its stock price will cater.\n\nBlackberry also may had a competitive advantage at some point and that's why it became so widely used.\n\nBut the advantage didn't last for long and it turns out the competitive advantage was not a durable one.\n\nEvery company you look at should have a clear, durable competitive advantage.\n\nFor instance, what's to keep Thor Industries, the largest manufacturer of recreational vehicles, to operate competitively?\n\nBecause it has the largest and most efficient manufacturing plants and largest dealership network in the world. There is a high barrier-to-entry for any new entrants to compete. Management has been known to be great capital allocators, meaning they know when to issue debt to build a new manufacturing plant, acquire a business, or buy back its own stock.\n\nThese points back up the claim that Thor has a durable competitive advantage and will keep the business growing.\n\nMy favorite way of identifying this edge is to try the product or service because a customer is usually the best judge of a value. You could easily try Starbucks, Shake Shack, and many other products from consumer companies.\n\nFor those that are business-facing like Salesforce, you can find surveys or product usages.\n\nMost of the times, however, a great product/service will always show traction in the early stages.\n\nAmazon, Facebook, and PayPal were gaining 200% new users every year in its early days.\n\nAmerican Express had a crazy growth in its early years as well.\n\nTake Upstart for example. And this is one of my favorite companies at the moment because it's in the sweet spot of growth and valuation.\n\nIt's growing sales at +90% clip yoy, that compares to avg 15% growth for its peer companies.\n\nWithout even testing out their product, I know something is working right with the products it's offering, as evidenced by the sales growth.\n\nOne important thing to be mindful of is that sometimes these growth can be non-organic, meaning the growth can be a result of acquisitions or aggressive marketing spending.\n\nIf you are growing your sales at 70% yoy but your user growth is only 40% yoy, that is a bad sign.\n\nAlternatively, if you are giving excessive concessions that your economics doesn't make sense, that's also an issue.\n\nFor instance, remember Moviepass? They were charging $10/month to watch an unlimited number of movies. While the user growth was exceptional, this model was clearly unsustainable and we should be wary of these kinds of business models.\n\nThe bottom line is that whenever you are looking to buy a stock of a company, the company should always have a durable competitive advantage in order for its stock to 10x in the next 5-10 years.\n\nPlease check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad89G90NUzQ) on YouTube for a better-explained version and check out [r/Midasinvestors](https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/) for steps 2 and 3!\n\nThank you all for reading and happy investing!",

        "selftext": "There are three fairly basic ways that new traders lose money in 2021:\n\n**1)** They read some elaborate post about how some piece of garbage stock is the next MEME explosion.  To their newbie eyes the extensive DD looked convincing, and the stock is *only* $10 a share right now, so they they buy 1,000 shares.  And then they average down another 1,000. Two months later they are being told by the same people that were wrong about their DD to begin with,  to hold on to the now, $8 stock.  Even worse, they now believe that selling that stock is \"exactly what the evil hedge funds want you to do!\".  A few months after that they are questioning their life choices and stuck with a useless $4 stock.\n\n**2)** Most YouTube videos are geared towards trying to sell you a method of Day Trading that is based on *Gap n Go* strategies.  These methods, while real, are far more difficult than they are made to appear, but yet they are very marketable (i.e. \"how to turn $5,000 into $50,000!\").  Instead what happens is new traders become singularly focused on finding low float, highly shorted stocks that jump up after the open, convinced they are moments away from the next big score.  Once again, months later they are questioning their life choices and stuck with an account that has dropped far below the PDT requirements\n\nAnd finally that brings us to OTM options:\n\n**3)** Slightly more sophisticated than the first two methods of losing your money, this one requires actual thought and analysis.  \n\nThe appeal is obvious - they are cheap.  And if the stock explodes those options can double, triple, etc in value.  \n\nHere's why they don't work - The options themselves have no real value other than the pure premium you are paying.  When *buying* options, your goal should always be to pay as little premium as possible.  Ideally you would have options at total parity (i.e. Stock is at $100 and the $99 Call Option is worth - $1).  \n\nSimple formula here for ITM Options - (Strike Price + Option Price) - Stock Price = Premium you are paying.\n\nSimpler formula for OTM Options - Option Price = Premium you are paying.\n\nSo let's take an example -\n\nYou like **CSCO,** it is smart pick, the daily chart looks good, it is past earnings (and seriously, please stop holding options over earnings) and looks like clear skies ahead.  Two choices:\n\n56 Strike Call, Expires Aug 27th for $2.35\n\n59 Strike Call, Expires Aug 27th for .30 cents\n\nLet's say you are going to spend $500 - so you can get 2 of the 56 Calls or 16 of the 59 Calls.  \n\nIf next week CSCO hardly moves at all (current at $58.22), your 56 calls will be worth $2.22 - a loss of only 13 cents per call or $26.  \n\nHowever, in that same scenario, your 59 calls will expire worthless, a loss of $480.  \n\nOK, let's say CSCO goes up $1 next week, it is now at $59.22 - \n\nYour 56 Calls are now worth $3.22 (at expiration), a profit of .87 per call or $174.\n\nYour 59 calls are now worth .22 a loss of .08 per Call or -$128.\n\n**OTM Options place heavy lifting on the stock to get you to profitability.  You are betting on a huge move in the stock that pull your options ITM faster than Theta strips away their value.**    \n\n***You are almost always better off going with ITM options, that have a Delta of .6 or higher and are at least a week out, if not more.***  \n\nIn fact, if you just stuck to these three rules it would increase you likelihood of success a great deal:\n\n**1) Do not trade Options over earnings, trade them before, trade them after, but do not hold them** ***over*** **the earnings announcement.**\n\n**2) Do not go for the cheaper OTM options, instead choose Calls or Puts that have a higher Delta and are farther out in time.**\n\n**3) Do not trade Option Spreads unless you know how to leg out of them if they do not go your way.**\n\n(the 3rd one may seem like a small issue, but the number of people that get stuck in spreads they do not know how to exit is alarmingly high).\n\nThis advice may seem basic to some traders here, but if you look at the posts on this forum you will quickly see that the foundational rules you may have been following as a trader aren't as obvious as you think.  New traders clearly do not know these basic principles and we should stop assuming they do.",

        "selftext": "I posted [my July earnings trading report](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/ov71vv/my_july_earnings_report/) last month, and many of you were kind enough to share your thoughts with me.\n\nTLDR: My July results were almost a scratch, $93 into a positive column, and I was undecided if trading earnings is a worthwhile thing.\n\nFast forward to the end of August\u2026 I couldn\u2019t keep away from earnings, just love trading them.\n\nHere are my August stats:\n\n* 21 earnings trades (short condors and strangles, all small positions, average BPu $532.85 per position)\n* 19 wins and 2 losses. A win rate - 90%. Better than July\u2019s 77%. A little experience helps!\n* My wins brought in $567.68\n* Losses took away $104.00\n* Net profit $463.68.\n\nWins: ABNB, BBY, CRM, CSCO, DASH, GPS, HPQ, INTU, M, MRVL, NVDA, PTON, SNOW, SPLK, TGT, TJX, ULTA, URBN, WDC\n\nLosses: LOW, JWN\n\nThe wins are great - no doubt. But it is the losses that are really interesting and have a high learning value. My losses show my indecision between two lines of thought: to defend a losing trade or to exit ASAP to minimize the loss. I have seen convincing arguments for both approaches, and am not yet sure where I stand on this.\n\nI managed my losing LOW trade fairly well in the beginning, brought it from several hundred down to around $30 loss. I could have brought it to a win, but I made a mistake - misread where I was standing and exited for a small loss. I learned how to read the position correctly and did another losing trade right - turned it into a win.\n\nI decided to take a loss on JWN because my overall win rate for August was around 93% and I thought I could afford a small loss. But now I think it could\u2019ve been managed and perhaps turned. But we\u2019ll never know if it could and if I had the skill to do it.\n\nWhere do you stand on this question? Do you defend? Or take a loss and move on to the next trade?",

If you wish to track my trades and try them out for yourself, feel free to check out the community links on my profile! Let\u2019s get into it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn\u2019t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you\u2019re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn\u2019t working for you, refer to the link below!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment, so I know whether or not I should keep on making them! Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is asinine.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I\u2019ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **This week is an awful week to play earnings.** Most companies are low quality, and don\u2019t have historically big moves. Options are also priced properly in most cases, meaning there isn\u2019t much edge to be gained on the buy side or the sell side. It\u2019s literally all just gambling, and as a result I\u2019m probably gonna sit this week out entirely. Pay little attention to the sample plays below, as I\u2019ve only included them for inspiration, and in case anyone sees something I may have missed.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Selling $DNUT puts may prove to be profitable.** Although justified, Krispy Kreme has been on a downtrend since its IPO. $DNUT is literally hemorrhaging money and fundamentally the company is a terrible investment. A couple of years ago they actually went private after defrauding investors, doing shady audit practices, and literally using company money to buy back stores owned by family members of the executive board for FIVE TIMES what they were worth. More info on that [here.](https://www.cfo.com/risk-compliance/2009/03/three-krispy-kreme-ex-execs-settle-sec-charges/) Nowadays, the stock is priced as what it is - a fraudulent, cash burning business. Earnings is priced to fail, and as a result, any semblance of positive news will likely send us going upwards. If you have the balls, selling puts may prove to be profitable. The 15P is going for $0.80 giving you a breakeven of around 5.5%. You can even pickup pennies in front of the steamroller and sell the 12.5P for $0.05, giving you a breakeven of 17%. Everyone is expecting $DNUT to fail, so if we get even a smidge of positive news, we\u2019re going up.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **$CSCO options are inefficiently priced.** This is literally the only pricing inefficiency at the time of writing. Options are pricing a 2% move, while historically Cisco moves around 5%. Given that prices remain the same or get cheaper by earnings, a strangle should net you some nice profits. If you\u2019re poor or want a binary directional play, I\u2019d look to buy puts. $CSCO is at ATHs so we\u2019re probably gonna do the classic \u201cdump after earnings regardless of the outcome\u201c thing that everyone seems to get tricked by. Regardless, at the time of writing, $CSCO strangles give us nice edge.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAll that being said, there aren\u2019t many trades to run this time round! If I notice anything extra during this week, I\u2019ll look to keep you guys posted on my socials. If you want extra trade theses or updates, alongside any live trade entries and exits, feel free to check out my Twitter or Discord! Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Summary and Conclusion\n\nAll in all, pretty awful week for trading. Most tickers are complete garbage, and there\u2019s little edge to be gained among those that aren\u2019t. No shame in sitting this one out! That being said, if you see any appealing plays I\u2019ve missed, feel free to let me know! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment!

Last weeks theme was selling options, and boy did we sell! **$APPS short strangles returned close to 100%, with $BIDU following closely behind netting around 80%. Meme stocks also had muted volatility. I sold an $AMC 34 strangle for $630, and although I closed early, I was given the opportunity to close it out at the end of the week for mere pennies on the dollar. Last but not least, a long strangle on $UPST would\u2019ve netted you a whopping 460% return!** Unfortunately for us, earnings season is slowly coming to a close, meaning the quality of our plays will be diminishing greatly! Those looking to trade this week should proceed with caution, as there isn\u2019t much of an edge to be gained this time round. If you wish to track my trades and try them out for yourself, feel free to check out the community links on my profile! Let\u2019s get into it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn\u2019t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you\u2019re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn\u2019t working for you, refer to the link below!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment, so I know whether or not I should keep on making them! Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is asinine.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I\u2019ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **This week is an awful week to play earnings.** Most companies are low quality, and don\u2019t have historically big moves. Options are also priced properly in most cases, meaning there isn\u2019t much edge to be gained on the buy side or the sell side. It\u2019s literally all just gambling, and as a result I\u2019m probably gonna sit this week out entirely. Pay little attention to the sample plays below, as I\u2019ve only included them for inspiration, and in case anyone sees something I may have missed.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Selling $DNUT puts may prove to be profitable.** Although justified, Krispy Kreme has been on a downtrend since its IPO. $DNUT is literally hemorrhaging money and fundamentally the company is a terrible investment. A couple of years ago they actually went private after defrauding investors, doing shady audit practices, and literally using company money to buy back stores owned by family members of the executive board for FIVE TIMES what they were worth. More info on that [here.](https://www.cfo.com/risk-compliance/2009/03/three-krispy-kreme-ex-execs-settle-sec-charges/) Nowadays, the stock is priced as what it is - a fraudulent, cash burning business. Earnings is priced to fail, and as a result, any semblance of positive news will likely send us going upwards. If you have the balls, selling puts may prove to be profitable. The 15P is going for $0.80 giving you a breakeven of around 5.5%. You can even pickup pennies in front of the steamroller and sell the 12.5P for $0.05, giving you a breakeven of 17%. Everyone is expecting $DNUT to fail, so if we get even a smidge of positive news, we\u2019re going up.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **$CSCO options are inefficiently priced.** This is literally the only pricing inefficiency at the time of writing. Options are pricing a 2% move, while historically Cisco moves around 5%. Given that prices remain the same or get cheaper by earnings, a strangle should net you some nice profits. If you\u2019re poor or want a binary directional play, I\u2019d look to buy puts. $CSCO is at ATHs so we\u2019re probably gonna do the classic \u201cdump after earnings regardless of the outcome\u201c thing that everyone seems to get tricked by. Regardless, at the time of writing, $CSCO strangles give us nice edge.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAll that being said, there aren\u2019t many trades to run this time round! If I notice anything extra during this week, I\u2019ll look to keep you guys posted on my socials. If you want extra trade theses or updates, alongside any live trade entries and exits, feel free to check out my Twitter or Discord! Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Summary and Conclusion\n\nAll in all, pretty awful week for trading. Most tickers are complete garbage, and there\u2019s little edge to be gained among those that aren\u2019t. No shame in sitting this one out! That being said, if you see any appealing plays I\u2019ve missed, feel free to let me know! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment! If you want access to more trading tools, or have any specific questions or observations you\u2019d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links within the spreadsheet or on my profile. **Happy Trading! :)**",

        "selftext": "(TSX:WELL)\n\nI\u2019m sure everyone has heard a lot about WELL Health - it was a pretty hot stock a couple months ago but I haven\u2019t been seeing much on them recently. I guess the novelty of the company started to wear off and people began to ask if WELL could continue to rise over the long term or if it was just a one-time thing due to the increased demand for virtual healthcare services amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The company has clearly done a great job recently with the expansions and acquisitions that they have been pursuing, including CRH and MyHealth, in order to diversify their exposure and I think WELL\u2019s beyond impressive Q2 results make it safe to say they aren\u2019t going anywhere.\n\nWELL achieved a record quarterly revenue of $61.8 million during the quarter, compared to revenue of $10.6 million generated during Q2-2020, an increase of 484% driven primarily by the CRH acquisition, which accounted for revenue of $36.7 million during the quarter. The company also produced positive EBITDA for the third consecutive quarter which is a great sign. With their own portfolio of over 25 clinics plus over 40 that were added from their acquisition of MyHealth, they are now the largest outpatient clinic operator in Canada. From a patient perspective, WELL\u2019s omni-channel patient visits grew by 19 per cent from quarter-to-quarter, registering 559,008 total visits in the quarter with in-person visits accounting for 43 per cent of the quota.\n\nLast month, WELL formed WELL Ventures, a wholly owned subsidiary that\u2019s purpose is to invest in companies that share WELL\u2019s vision on healthcare. Historically, WELL has been successful at identifying strong businesses to invest in and they hope to use WELL Ventures to continue finding profitable business opportunities.\n\nThe CEO of WELL has also mentioned a NASDAQ listing in October. Recently announced was their partnership with renowned law firm Fenwick &amp; West, which helped Facebook, Amazon, Cisco, and Coinbase with their IPOs. This is important because WELL\u2019s equivalents in the US are currently trading at much higher multiples making this a unique opportunity to get on the gains. Once WELL goes live on the NASDAQ, US funds will be hammering this stock.\n\nFor a deeper dive into their Q2 results, check out: [https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/well-health-achieves-record-revenue-and-adjusted-ebitda-in-q2-2021-with-484-yoy-revenue-growth-and-615-growth-in-its-adjusted-gross-profit-868134844.html](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/well-health-achieves-record-revenue-and-adjusted-ebitda-in-q2-2021-with-484-yoy-revenue-growth-and-615-growth-in-its-adjusted-gross-profit-868134844.html)\n\nThis is not financial advice, if you are interested in the company look into them!",
