        "selftext": "\nThis is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.\nThe SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 6th, 2020.\n\n# **For markets in week ahead, investors will gauge the severity of the coronavirus spread  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/02/for-markets-in-week-ahead-investors-will-gauge-the-severity-of-the-coronavirus-spread.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks in the week ahead will focus on the severity of the spread of the coronavirus, during what should be a lull between Thursday\u2019s strong jobs report and the upcoming earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks had a bang-up week, in the four days ahead of the long July 4 weekend, with all indexes making sharp gains. A surprise record gain of 4.8 million jobs in June lifted stocks on Thursday, boosting sentiment into the weekend. The S&amp;P 500 was up 4%% at 3,130, and the Dow was up 3.2% at 25,827%, in their best week since June 5. The Nasdaq, up 4.6% posted its best week since May 7 and closed at a record 10,207.\n*****\n&gt; Tom Lee, founder of Fundstrat, said the market has further to go, even with new U.S. coronavirus cases reaching a record daily high above 50,000.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s more weak sellers, and I think the market is in the hands of buyers. I think stocks are going to do pretty well in July,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s just too much cash on the sidelines, and there\u2019s concern about the virus. There\u2019s too much concern about the economy. There is just too much of a wall of worry.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks have been able to shrug off the spreading coronavirus outbreak that has resulted in renewed shutdowns of some economic activity and delays to some anticipated openings. There is concern those economic closings could be a blow the recovery, making it more shallow and less sustainable than expected.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings season starts mid-month, and there are just a few reports in the coming week. Levi Strauss releases earnings Tuesday, Bed, Bath and Beyond is Wednesday, and Walgreens Boots Alliance reports Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; According to Refinitiv, second-quarter earnings are expect to be down 43%.\n*****\n&gt; As earnings start to roll out, Congress may also be a focus for markets as it negotiates the next round of stimulus.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe know July is going to be difficult unless we get more fiscal policy,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Alliance. \u201cThe labor market is going to run dry or at least slow down because part of it is helped by government assistance.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Congress has a small window after July 20 to debate the phase 4 Covid stimulus package, which is expected to include a renewal of enhanced unemployment benefits that expire at the end of July. But there\u2019s disagreement on what those benefits should be, and how big the package should be. It also is expected to include aid for state and local governments.\n*****\n&gt; As states shut activity again, there is concern that some data that has shown big improvements may not continue to do so. \u201cAre markets prepared to see sequential data that doesn\u2019t improve? At some point the markets may pay more attention to that, but right now we\u2019re riding on a wave of better data and positive vaccine news,\u201d Hogan said, adding a worrisome wild card is the extent of the outbreak.\n*****\n&gt; In the week ahead, there are just a few data releases, including jobless claims Thursday.

In our July report published yesterday, we highlighted the chart below which shows the Dow's average change by month over the last 100, 50, and 20 years. One notable trend is that over the last 20 years, the Dow has actually averaged declines in half of all months. The summer months have been particularly negative, but July is the one month that stands out on the bullish side. As shown in the table, July is the only month from May through September that has averaged gains over the last 20 years, and the average gain has been quite strong at 1.32%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/avgdow.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Best Quarter Since 1998\n\n&gt; What a quarter the second quarter was, with the S&amp;P 500 Index adding 20.0%, for the best quarter since 1998 and the best second quarter since 1938. Of course, stocks fell 20% in the first quarter, so what we really have is a bad case of whiplash in 2020 thus far.\n\n&gt; \u201cA 20% quarterly gain is quite rare, but the catch is previous large quarterly gains have actually led to continued strength,\u201d according to LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIn fact, a quarter later stocks have been higher the past 8 times after gaining at least 15% during the previous quarter.\u201d\n\n&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, future strong returns are quite normal after a big quarter. Although it might not seem likely given the headlines and magnitude of the current bounce, it is important to be aware that extreme strength usually begets more strength.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.1.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 2020 is halfway over, which means the third quarter is upon us. Historically, the third quarter has been the weakest quarter of the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.1.20-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Breaking it down more though shows that July has been actually the strongest month during the summer. August and September have tended to be troublesome and dragged the third quarter down.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.1.20-blog-chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Why Stocks Can Predict The Next President\n\n&gt; Although the fight against COVID-19 continues to dominate the headlines and our thoughts are with those affected, this is an election year and as we get closer to November it will begin to garner more attention. Next week in our Weekly Market Commentary, we will discuss the election in more detail, but today we wanted to share a very interesting connection between the stock market and election.\n\n&gt; Turns out, since 1928, the stock market has accurately predicted the winner of the election 87% of the time and every single year since 1984. It is quite simple. When the S&amp;P 500 Index has been higher the three months before the election, the incumbent party usually won, while when stocks were lower, the incumbent party usually lost.\n\n&gt; \u201cThink about it; no one expected Hillary Clinton to lose back in 2016, no one except the stock market that is,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThe Dow had a 9-day losing streak directly ahead of the election, while copper (more of a President Trump infrastructure play) was up a record 14 days in a row, setting the stage for the change in party leadership in the White House.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, as we get closer to the election, how stocks are doing could signal who might win in November.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.29.20-Blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# First Half and Q2 2020 Asset Class Performance\n\n&gt; Global pandemics, bear markets, bull markets, countless records in economic data, and widespread protests made for an eventful first half of 2020, to say the least. In the table below we show the total return of various asset classes using key ETFs in June, Q2, and the first half of 2020. As shown, overall the best performing assets in June could be found outside the US as international stocks surged. Hong Kong (EWH) in particular was the best performing asset in June. Oil (USO) similarly saw solid returns of 8.42% during the month but remained the second-worst performing asset in Q2 behind Natural Gas (UNG) which was also the worst-performing asset in June. Additionally, oil was the worst-performing asset in the first half of the year. Meanwhile, although their returns were more muted in Q2 and June, Treasuries (namely at the long end of the curve) were some of the top performers in the first half. Precious metals similarly were strong performers in the first half with particular strength from silver (SLV) in Q2. Silver actually saw returns in line with cyclical equities in Q2.\n\n&gt; In terms of the US equities space, the Tech heavy Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) drastically outperformed closing out June with a 16.91% gain in the first half. In Q2 and June, it was also the best performing major index by a wide margin. On a sector basis, Technology (XLK), Energy (XLE), and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) all rose over 30% in Q2 just like the Nasdaq did, though their first half and June returns were more modest with the exception of the Tech sector whose returns were more in line with that of the Nasdaq.\n\n&gt; Investing based on market cap saw some interesting dynamics as well. Even though small caps are some of the major US indices down the most on the year\u2014S&amp;P 600 Small Caps (IJR) are down 17.89% and the Russell 2000 (IWM) is down 12.96% YTD\u2014there was some catch up in June as these indices were some of the best performers. That applies to both growth and value names though small cap value (IJS) is still one of the most beaten-down groups in the US equities space. On the other hand, large-cap growth (IVW) offered the strongest returns in June, Q2, and the first half when compared to the various other style ETFs.\n\n&gt; Outside of the US, even with big gains in June, countries like Brazil (EWZ), France (EWQ), Italy (EWI), and Spain (EWP) remain down big on the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/assetclass0701.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Market Stronger Before Independence Day Holiday than After\n\n&gt; Over the last 21 years, the trading day before Independence Day has been stronger than the day after. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have advanced 60.9% of the time with average gains of 0.15% and 0.12% respectively on the day before. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 are slightly softer on the day before, but still lean bullish. On the trading day after Independence Day all four indexes have declined more frequently than advanced. DJIA has recorded the fewest number of advances while Russell 2000 has the worst average performance with a 0.14% loss.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2874a99c8692a0cb73d5cd8b5f8631e4/11d00da611e2cc9e-52/s500x750/8a9b484d44537a8ac9d3bb6ea482b05a63c8017f.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$PAYX** \n&gt; * **$ASPU** \n&gt; * **$SMPL** \n&gt; * **$WBA** \n&gt; * **$BBBY** \n&gt; * **$LEVI** \n&gt; * **$SGH** \n&gt; * **$MSM** \n&gt; * **$HELE** \n&gt; * **$AZZ** \n&gt; * **$WDFC** \n&gt; * **$GBX** \n&gt; * **$NTIC** \n&gt; * **$MARK** \n&gt; * **$SAR** \n&gt; * **$SLP** \n&gt; * **$FC** \n&gt; * **$SJR** \n&gt; * **$JMDA** \n&gt; * **$EXFO** \n&gt; * **$CPST**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/x8Rk8GYG/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/3rC0thpy/ervol1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 3 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/XH4RkL4.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.6.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.6.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uKFekV6.png))\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.7.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EE8hLQU.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.7.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2scRfYD.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.8.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eOMTIlF.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvKtzSY.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.9.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/h0DZeOw.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/w6Eo9Dl.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.10.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.10.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/kiyHjD5.png))\n\n*****\n\n# Paychex, Inc. $76.59\n&gt; **Paychex, Inc.

        "selftext": "This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.\nThe SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 6th, 2020.\n\n# **For markets in week ahead, investors will gauge the severity of the coronavirus spread  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/02/for-markets-in-week-ahead-investors-will-gauge-the-severity-of-the-coronavirus-spread.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks in the week ahead will focus on the severity of the spread of the coronavirus, during what should be a lull between Thursday\u2019s strong jobs report and the upcoming earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks had a bang-up week, in the four days ahead of the long July 4 weekend, with all indexes making sharp gains. A surprise record gain of 4.8 million jobs in June lifted stocks on Thursday, boosting sentiment into the weekend. The S&amp;P 500 was up 4%% at 3,130, and the Dow was up 3.2% at 25,827%, in their best week since June 5. The Nasdaq, up 4.6% posted its best week since May 7 and closed at a record 10,207.\n*****\n&gt; Tom Lee, founder of Fundstrat, said the market has further to go, even with new U.S. coronavirus cases reaching a record daily high above 50,000.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s more weak sellers, and I think the market is in the hands of buyers. I think stocks are going to do pretty well in July,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s just too much cash on the sidelines, and there\u2019s concern about the virus. There\u2019s too much concern about the economy. There is just too much of a wall of worry.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks have been able to shrug off the spreading coronavirus outbreak that has resulted in renewed shutdowns of some economic activity and delays to some anticipated openings. There is concern those economic closings could be a blow the recovery, making it more shallow and less sustainable than expected.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings season starts mid-month, and there are just a few reports in the coming week. Levi Strauss releases earnings Tuesday, Bed, Bath and Beyond is Wednesday, and Walgreens Boots Alliance reports Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; According to Refinitiv, second-quarter earnings are expect to be down 43%.\n*****\n&gt; As earnings start to roll out, Congress may also be a focus for markets as it negotiates the next round of stimulus.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe know July is going to be difficult unless we get more fiscal policy,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Alliance. \u201cThe labor market is going to run dry or at least slow down because part of it is helped by government assistance.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Congress has a small window after July 20 to debate the phase 4 Covid stimulus package, which is expected to include a renewal of enhanced unemployment benefits that expire at the end of July. But there\u2019s disagreement on what those benefits should be, and how big the package should be. It also is expected to include aid for state and local governments.\n*****\n&gt; As states shut activity again, there is concern that some data that has shown big improvements may not continue to do so. \u201cAre markets prepared to see sequential data that doesn\u2019t improve? At some point the markets may pay more attention to that, but right now we\u2019re riding on a wave of better data and positive vaccine news,\u201d Hogan said, adding a worrisome wild card is the extent of the outbreak.\n*****\n&gt; In the week ahead, there are just a few data releases, including jobless claims Thursday. They will again be important, especially after continuing claims actually rose in the past week\u2019s release by 59,000 to 19.3 million, despite the surge in rehiring, evident in the June employment report.\n*****\n&gt; ISM nonmanufacturing data will be released Monday, and it will also get more than the usual attention.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe key to next week is going to be the ISM services number, which will be important because of the dependence we have on the service side of the economy,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group.\n*****\n&gt; But it\u2019s virus news that may ultimately decide the course of the market and the economy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think there\u2019s people watching 12 vaccines, but nobody really has an idea on the cadence of the news. If it gets negative, it\u2019s negative for markets,\u201d said Lee. In the past week, stocks reacted to positive vaccine news from Pfizer.\n*****\n&gt; Lee said the market has been able to look past the concerning rise in cases because death rates have been lower in the latest outbreak, which is affecting far more younger people.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s telling us cases are less important than severity,\u201d Lee said, adding the outbreak is still a big risk for markets. \u201cIt would be important for Texas , Florida or California to show a local peak.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; In the coming week, the Treasury will auction $46 billion 3-year notes Tuesday, $29 billion reopened 10-year notes Wednesday and $19 billion in reopened 30-year bonds Thursday.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/pS6M0lX.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/H0UCveg.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/p7VHYM6.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/mg7YpB8J/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/4L0G4Gw.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/0rUWTtd.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/6LOVpzU.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/tBlfDmW.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/VLvWgZ7M/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Thursday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/8K649Jh.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/rmiSV20.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# July Market Seasonality\n\n&gt; At the start of each month, we send members our seasonality report that highlights the historical performance of the US stock market by month. In our July report published yesterday, we highlighted the chart below which shows the Dow's average change by month over the last 100, 50, and 20 years. One notable trend is that over the last 20 years, the Dow has actually averaged declines in half of all months. The summer months have been particularly negative, but July is the one month that stands out on the bullish side. As shown in the table, July is the only month from May through September that has averaged gains over the last 20 years, and the average gain has been quite strong at 1.32%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/avgdow.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Best Quarter Since 1998\n\n&gt; What a quarter the second quarter was, with the S&amp;P 500 Index adding 20.0%, for the best quarter since 1998 and the best second quarter since 1938. Of course, stocks fell 20% in the first quarter, so what we really have is a bad case of whiplash in 2020 thus far.\n\n&gt; \u201cA 20% quarterly gain is quite rare, but the catch is previous large quarterly gains have actually led to continued strength,\u201d according to LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIn fact, a quarter later stocks have been higher the past 8 times after gaining at least 15% during the previous quarter.\u201d\n\n&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, future strong returns are quite normal after a big quarter. Although it might not seem likely given the headlines and magnitude of the current bounce, it is important to be aware that extreme strength usually begets more strength.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.1.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 2020 is halfway over, which means the third quarter is upon us. Historically, the third quarter has been the weakest quarter of the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.1.20-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Breaking it down more though shows that July has been actually the strongest month during the summer. August and September have tended to be troublesome and dragged the third quarter down.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.1.20-blog-chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Why Stocks Can Predict The Next President\n\n&gt; Although the fight against COVID-19 continues to dominate the headlines and our thoughts are with those affected, this is an election year and as we get closer to November it will begin to garner more attention. Next week in our Weekly Market Commentary, we will discuss the election in more detail, but today we wanted to share a very interesting connection between the stock market and election.\n\n&gt; Turns out, since 1928, the stock market has accurately predicted the winner of the election 87% of the time and every single year since 1984. It is quite simple. When the S&amp;P 500 Index has been higher the three months before the election, the incumbent party usually won, while when stocks were lower, the incumbent party usually lost.\n\n&gt; \u201cThink about it; no one expected Hillary Clinton to lose back in 2016, no one except the stock market that is,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThe Dow had a 9-day losing streak directly ahead of the election, while copper (more of a President Trump infrastructure play) was up a record 14 days in a row, setting the stage for the change in party leadership in the White House.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, as we get closer to the election, how stocks are doing could signal who might win in November.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.29.20-Blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# First Half and Q2 2020 Asset Class Performance\n\n&gt; Global pandemics, bear markets, bull markets, countless records in economic data, and widespread protests made for an eventful first half of 2020, to say the least. In the table below we show the total return of various asset classes using key ETFs in June, Q2, and the first half of 2020. As shown, overall the best performing assets in June could be found outside the US as international stocks surged. Hong Kong (EWH) in particular was the best performing asset in June. Oil (USO) similarly saw solid returns of 8.42% during the month but remained the second-worst performing asset in Q2 behind Natural Gas (UNG) which was also the worst-performing asset in June. Additionally, oil was the worst-performing asset in the first half of the year. Meanwhile, although their returns were more muted in Q2 and June, Treasuries (namely at the long end of the curve) were some of the top performers in the first half. Precious metals similarly were strong performers in the first half with particular strength from silver (SLV) in Q2. Silver actually saw returns in line with cyclical equities in Q2.\n\n&gt; In terms of the US equities space, the Tech heavy Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) drastically outperformed closing out June with a 16.91% gain in the first half. In Q2 and June, it was also the best performing major index by a wide margin. On a sector basis, Technology (XLK), Energy (XLE), and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) all rose over 30% in Q2 just like the Nasdaq did, though their first half and June returns were more modest with the exception of the Tech sector whose returns were more in line with that of the Nasdaq.\n\n&gt; Investing based on market cap saw some interesting dynamics as well. Even though small caps are some of the major US indices down the most on the year\u2014S&amp;P 600 Small Caps (IJR) are down 17.89% and the Russell 2000 (IWM) is down 12.96% YTD\u2014there was some catch up in June as these indices were some of the best performers. That applies to both growth and value names though small cap value (IJS) is still one of the most beaten-down groups in the US equities space. On the other hand, large-cap growth (IVW) offered the strongest returns in June, Q2, and the first half when compared to the various other style ETFs.\n\n&gt; Outside of the US, even with big gains in June, countries like Brazil (EWZ), France (EWQ), Italy (EWI), and Spain (EWP) remain down big on the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/assetclass0701.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Market Stronger Before Independence Day Holiday than After\n\n&gt; Over the last 21 years, the trading day before Independence Day has been stronger than the day after. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have advanced 60.9% of the time with average gains of 0.15% and 0.12% respectively on the day before. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 are slightly softer on the day before, but still lean bullish. On the trading day after Independence Day all four indexes have declined more frequently than advanced. DJIA has recorded the fewest number of advances while Russell 2000 has the worst average performance with a 0.14% loss.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2874a99c8692a0cb73d5cd8b5f8631e4/11d00da611e2cc9e-52/s500x750/8a9b484d44537a8ac9d3bb6ea482b05a63c8017f.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$PAYX** \n&gt; * **$ASPU** \n&gt; * **$SMPL** \n&gt; * **$WBA** \n&gt; * **$BBBY** \n&gt; * **$LEVI** \n&gt; * **$SGH** \n&gt; * **$MSM** \n&gt; * **$HELE** \n&gt; * **$AZZ** \n&gt; * **$WDFC** \n&gt; * **$GBX** \n&gt; * **$NTIC** \n&gt; * **$MARK** \n&gt; * **$SAR** \n&gt; * **$SLP** \n&gt; * **$FC** \n&gt; * **$SJR** \n&gt; * **$JMDA** \n&gt; * **$EXFO** \n&gt; * **$CPST**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/x8Rk8GYG/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/3rC0thpy/ervol1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 3 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/XH4RkL4.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.6.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.6.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uKFekV6.png))\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.7.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EE8hLQU.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.7.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2scRfYD.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.8.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eOMTIlF.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvKtzSY.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.9.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/h0DZeOw.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/w6Eo9Dl.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.10.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.10.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/kiyHjD5.png))\n\n*****\n\n# Paychex, Inc. $76.59\n&gt; **Paychex, Inc.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 6th, 2020.\n\n# **For markets in week ahead, investors will gauge the severity of the coronavirus spread  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/02/for-markets-in-week-ahead-investors-will-gauge-the-severity-of-the-coronavirus-spread.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks in the week ahead will focus on the severity of the spread of the coronavirus, during what should be a lull between Thursday\u2019s strong jobs report and the upcoming earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks had a bang-up week, in the four days ahead of the long July 4 weekend, with all indexes making sharp gains. A surprise record gain of 4.8 million jobs in June lifted stocks on Thursday, boosting sentiment into the weekend. The S&amp;P 500 was up 4%% at 3,130, and the Dow was up 3.2% at 25,827%, in their best week since June 5. The Nasdaq, up 4.6% posted its best week since May 7 and closed at a record 10,207.\n*****\n&gt; Tom Lee, founder of Fundstrat, said the market has further to go, even with new U.S. coronavirus cases reaching a record daily high above 50,000.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s more weak sellers, and I think the market is in the hands of buyers. I think stocks are going to do pretty well in July,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s just too much cash on the sidelines, and there\u2019s concern about the virus. There\u2019s too much concern about the economy. There is just too much of a wall of worry.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks have been able to shrug off the spreading coronavirus outbreak that has resulted in renewed shutdowns of some economic activity and delays to some anticipated openings. There is concern those economic closings could be a blow the recovery, making it more shallow and less sustainable than expected.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings season starts mid-month, and there are just a few reports in the coming week. Levi Strauss releases earnings Tuesday, Bed, Bath and Beyond is Wednesday, and Walgreens Boots Alliance reports Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; According to Refinitiv, second-quarter earnings are expect to be down 43%.\n*****\n&gt; As earnings start to roll out, Congress may also be a focus for markets as it negotiates the next round of stimulus.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe know July is going to be difficult unless we get more fiscal policy,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Alliance. \u201cThe labor market is going to run dry or at least slow down because part of it is helped by government assistance.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Congress has a small window after July 20 to debate the phase 4 Covid stimulus package, which is expected to include a renewal of enhanced unemployment benefits that expire at the end of July. But there\u2019s disagreement on what those benefits should be, and how big the package should be. It also is expected to include aid for state and local governments.\n*****\n&gt; As states shut activity again, there is concern that some data that has shown big improvements may not continue to do so. \u201cAre markets prepared to see sequential data that doesn\u2019t improve? At some point the markets may pay more attention to that, but right now we\u2019re riding on a wave of better data and positive vaccine news,\u201d Hogan said, adding a worrisome wild card is the extent of the outbreak.\n*****\n&gt; In the week ahead, there are just a few data releases, including jobless claims Thursday. They will again be important, especially after continuing claims actually rose in the past week\u2019s release by 59,000 to 19.3 million, despite the surge in rehiring, evident in the June employment report.\n*****\n&gt; ISM nonmanufacturing data will be released Monday, and it will also get more than the usual attention.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe key to next week is going to be the ISM services number, which will be important because of the dependence we have on the service side of the economy,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group.\n*****\n&gt; But it\u2019s virus news that may ultimately decide the course of the market and the economy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think there\u2019s people watching 12 vaccines, but nobody really has an idea on the cadence of the news. If it gets negative, it\u2019s negative for markets,\u201d said Lee. In the past week, stocks reacted to positive vaccine news from Pfizer.\n*****\n&gt; Lee said the market has been able to look past the concerning rise in cases because death rates have been lower in the latest outbreak, which is affecting far more younger people.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s telling us cases are less important than severity,\u201d Lee said, adding the outbreak is still a big risk for markets. \u201cIt would be important for Texas , Florida or California to show a local peak.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; In the coming week, the Treasury will auction $46 billion 3-year notes Tuesday, $29 billion reopened 10-year notes Wednesday and $19 billion in reopened 30-year bonds Thursday.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/pS6M0lX.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/H0UCveg.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/p7VHYM6.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/mg7YpB8J/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/4L0G4Gw.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/0rUWTtd.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/6LOVpzU.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/tBlfDmW.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/VLvWgZ7M/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Thursday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/8K649Jh.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/rmiSV20.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# July Market Seasonality\n\n&gt; At the start of each month, we send members our seasonality report that highlights the historical performance of the US stock market by month. In our July report published yesterday, we highlighted the chart below which shows the Dow's average change by month over the last 100, 50, and 20 years. One notable trend is that over the last 20 years, the Dow has actually averaged declines in half of all months. The summer months have been particularly negative, but July is the one month that stands out on the bullish side. As shown in the table, July is the only month from May through September that has averaged gains over the last 20 years, and the average gain has been quite strong at 1.32%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/avgdow.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Best Quarter Since 1998\n\n&gt; What a quarter the second quarter was, with the S&amp;P 500 Index adding 20.0%, for the best quarter since 1998 and the best second quarter since 1938. Of course, stocks fell 20% in the first quarter, so what we really have is a bad case of whiplash in 2020 thus far.\n\n&gt; \u201cA 20% quarterly gain is quite rare, but the catch is previous large quarterly gains have actually led to continued strength,\u201d according to LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIn fact, a quarter later stocks have been higher the past 8 times after gaining at least 15% during the previous quarter.\u201d\n\n&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, future strong returns are quite normal after a big quarter. Although it might not seem likely given the headlines and magnitude of the current bounce, it is important to be aware that extreme strength usually begets more strength.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.1.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 2020 is halfway over, which means the third quarter is upon us. Historically, the third quarter has been the weakest quarter of the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.1.20-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Breaking it down more though shows that July has been actually the strongest month during the summer. August and September have tended to be troublesome and dragged the third quarter down.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.1.20-blog-chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Why Stocks Can Predict The Next President\n\n&gt; Although the fight against COVID-19 continues to dominate the headlines and our thoughts are with those affected, this is an election year and as we get closer to November it will begin to garner more attention. Next week in our Weekly Market Commentary, we will discuss the election in more detail, but today we wanted to share a very interesting connection between the stock market and election.\n\n&gt; Turns out, since 1928, the stock market has accurately predicted the winner of the election 87% of the time and every single year since 1984. It is quite simple. When the S&amp;P 500 Index has been higher the three months before the election, the incumbent party usually won, while when stocks were lower, the incumbent party usually lost.\n\n&gt; \u201cThink about it; no one expected Hillary Clinton to lose back in 2016, no one except the stock market that is,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThe Dow had a 9-day losing streak directly ahead of the election, while copper (more of a President Trump infrastructure play) was up a record 14 days in a row, setting the stage for the change in party leadership in the White House.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, as we get closer to the election, how stocks are doing could signal who might win in November.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.29.20-Blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# First Half and Q2 2020 Asset Class Performance\n\n&gt; Global pandemics, bear markets, bull markets, countless records in economic data, and widespread protests made for an eventful first half of 2020, to say the least. In the table below we show the total return of various asset classes using key ETFs in June, Q2, and the first half of 2020. As shown, overall the best performing assets in June could be found outside the US as international stocks surged. Hong Kong (EWH) in particular was the best performing asset in June. Oil (USO) similarly saw solid returns of 8.42% during the month but remained the second-worst performing asset in Q2 behind Natural Gas (UNG) which was also the worst-performing asset in June. Additionally, oil was the worst-performing asset in the first half of the year. Meanwhile, although their returns were more muted in Q2 and June, Treasuries (namely at the long end of the curve) were some of the top performers in the first half. Precious metals similarly were strong performers in the first half with particular strength from silver (SLV) in Q2. Silver actually saw returns in line with cyclical equities in Q2.\n\n&gt; In terms of the US equities space, the Tech heavy Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) drastically outperformed closing out June with a 16.91% gain in the first half. In Q2 and June, it was also the best performing major index by a wide margin. On a sector basis, Technology (XLK), Energy (XLE), and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) all rose over 30% in Q2 just like the Nasdaq did, though their first half and June returns were more modest with the exception of the Tech sector whose returns were more in line with that of the Nasdaq.\n\n&gt; Investing based on market cap saw some interesting dynamics as well. Even though small caps are some of the major US indices down the most on the year\u2014S&amp;P 600 Small Caps (IJR) are down 17.89% and the Russell 2000 (IWM) is down 12.96% YTD\u2014there was some catch up in June as these indices were some of the best performers. That applies to both growth and value names though small cap value (IJS) is still one of the most beaten-down groups in the US equities space. On the other hand, large-cap growth (IVW) offered the strongest returns in June, Q2, and the first half when compared to the various other style ETFs.\n\n&gt; Outside of the US, even with big gains in June, countries like Brazil (EWZ), France (EWQ), Italy (EWI), and Spain (EWP) remain down big on the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/assetclass0701.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Market Stronger Before Independence Day Holiday than After\n\n&gt; Over the last 21 years, the trading day before Independence Day has been stronger than the day after. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have advanced 60.9% of the time with average gains of 0.15% and 0.12% respectively on the day before. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 are slightly softer on the day before, but still lean bullish. On the trading day after Independence Day all four indexes have declined more frequently than advanced. DJIA has recorded the fewest number of advances while Russell 2000 has the worst average performance with a 0.14% loss.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2874a99c8692a0cb73d5cd8b5f8631e4/11d00da611e2cc9e-52/s500x750/8a9b484d44537a8ac9d3bb6ea482b05a63c8017f.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$PAYX** \n&gt; * **$ASPU** \n&gt; * **$SMPL** \n&gt; * **$WBA** \n&gt; * **$BBBY** \n&gt; * **$LEVI** \n&gt; * **$SGH** \n&gt; * **$MSM** \n&gt; * **$HELE** \n&gt; * **$AZZ** \n&gt; * **$WDFC** \n&gt; * **$GBX** \n&gt; * **$NTIC** \n&gt; * **$MARK** \n&gt; * **$SAR** \n&gt; * **$SLP** \n&gt; * **$FC** \n&gt; * **$SJR** \n&gt; * **$JMDA** \n&gt; * **$EXFO** \n&gt; * **$CPST**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/x8Rk8GYG/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/3rC0thpy/ervol1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 3 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/XH4RkL4.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.6.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.6.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uKFekV6.png))\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.7.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EE8hLQU.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.7.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2scRfYD.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.8.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eOMTIlF.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvKtzSY.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.9.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/h0DZeOw.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/w6Eo9Dl.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.10.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.10.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/kiyHjD5.png))\n\n*****\n\n# Paychex, Inc. $76.59\n&gt; **Paychex, Inc.
