        "selftext": "The reason palantir was down recently was due to lockup expiration, which happened on Feb 18.\n\nEarly investors and employees that hold their shares for over a decade was able to sell portion of their shares to buy their new shiny car, house, and/or other reasons, had already done so. This create a very healthy pullback.\n\nNow is your chance to pick up the best long term AI and data analytic company with the biggest moat in tech.\n\nConsider these factors:\n\n\\-High Growth in the hottest AI and data analytic industry with a lot of IP.\n\n\\-Very low debt with $2 billion hand in hand.\n\n\\-Very high Gross Margin and Operating margin that keep going up as revenue increase at the same time, means that are really well run and they'll be very profitable in the future. They would have made a profit of $170million from the last 2 quarters if it wasn't for stock-based compensations.\n\n\\-Sticky customers that include governments and big expertises.\n\n\\-Limitless use case across almost any industry. Help BP become greener. Aid in cancer research. Help prevent wildfire in california. Help distribute the vaccine for covid-19. Help prevent future pandemic and disasters. Basically limitless use cases that help any corporation or government run large amount of data to discover the truth behind their data.\n\n\\-Palantir create disruptive future software that is ready for prime time and only recently started to get adopted by large corporation.\n\n\\-Great leadership\n\n\\-Cream of the crop employees. Beat out all of the FANNG companies.\n\n\\-No real competitors. Huge moat. One of the co-founder is Peter Thiel, also a co-founder of Paypal, and the author of \"Zero to One\". Where his philosophy is  always \"aim for monopoly, competition is for losers \".\n\n\\-Very forward looking. They create technology not for the past, but for the future need. Karp, their CEO said their goal is to become the world most \"important software company\" in the future.\n\n\\- They are able to create test simulation on your whole companies to see how different components affect your overall business from top to bottom and see how one change can affect the entire organization.\n\n\\-Create massive value for their clients by saving cost and becoming more efficient.\n\n\\-Allow any employees from your organization to make meaningful contribution without hiring costly data scientist that only perform ad-hoc task.\n\n\\-SaaS with apollo. Apollo allow SasS to be in almost anything like a submarine, with little or unstable internet connection, harsh environments, humvees, and etc. Before Apollo everything is frozen in time with old and unsecured legacy preinstalled software.\n\n\\- Interactive and easy to use user interface that is customizable to whatever you want.\n\n\\-Can be integrated with private cloud, AWS, google cloud, hybrid cloud, etc.\n\n\\-Highest level security trusted by the government.\n\n\\-They can now massively scale their services.\n\n\\-Significantly reduced their deployment from Months down to Hours and Days.\n\n\\-Ontology create a overview and blueprint of the entire organization and see how each component interact in real-time.\n\n\\-Modular of their foundry software for small and mid-size business\n\n\\-Recent partnership with IBM increase palantir's Sales force from less than 30 to over 2000. Palantir was able to grow to \\~1 Billion annually revenue with virtually no salespeople before 2020.\n\n\\-no code, abstract away time consuming processes, saving organization from hiring costly computer scientist, giving business managers/executive with no coding background, no CS degree, or no data science degree ability to contribute and make meaning decisions from the bottom up. Just like Windows did for the personal PC, Palantir is doing it for data analytics and AI. This is a big deal. The next frontier of technology after data analytics and AI, It is going to be bigger than the internet.\n\n\\-Allow data from different silos and types to flow in real-time to make better decisions. What life have taught me is that making the right decision at the right time is the most important thing in the world.\n\n\\-Constantly adding new features and making improvements to existing product line. Foundry for business was only released in a couple years ago and Apollo was only released in 2020, but it already made significant impact on their up and bottom line.\n\n\\- There is no doubt that big data analytics and AI is next technology that is going starting to go mainstream and is going to be a big game changers and will create massive wealth for first adaptors because it is a winner takes all market.\n\nThe progress of technology:\n\nInternet-&gt;Personal PC-&gt;Web Search-&gt;Ecommerce-&gt;Social Media-&gt;Smartphone-&gt;Cyber Security-&gt;Cloud Computing-&gt;Streaming-&gt;cryptocurrency-&gt;Automation-&gt;Data Analytics-&gt;AI\n\nData Analytics-&gt;AI is the last frontier and will create the most value and wealth because their application is limitless.",

        "selftext": "It\u2019s very interesting reading over this and other subs with influx of new people wasting their time and energy on trying to explain daily move without looking at the big picture , the biggest difference you will spot between people with and without experience is that after you been investing for a while you stop carrying what is happening and why day to day or even month to month  , you just accept randomness of market with millions buyers and sellers who all have their own goals and plans and insensitive doing their thing and sometimes they buy more and sometimes they sell more, life goes on.\n\nSo , let\u2019s look at the big picture to understand why we going to have a crazy bull run that\u2019s been happening since 2013 ( some argue 2020 was reset , but imo it was event driven violent pullback and rally back with same intensity , I would argue until we go down -20% and stay there for couple month bull market is not dead )\n\n1.\n\nXLK , financial ETF, you know, boomer shit like banks etc no sexy SQ or PayPal fin tech,  we broke off 2007 top we had pre 2008 explosion when ETF still had BS and Lehman , spreads benefits banks and good for profits and if the banks are making money it\u2019s good for market , I don\u2019t think we ever had a serious market issues if banking sector doing good \n\n2. Euro 600\n\nSTOXX 600, dead money for 20 years and we finally past 2000 peak , could be false breakout but we shall see, euro full of boomer shit like banks and old economy companies , I am not super bullish on them but why not own them at cheaper valuation then USA ,half the people who jerk off to Warren B would love to try to dumpster dive  and pick nuggets or just buy who basket \n\n3. Japan and emerging markets \n\nBoth outperformed sp500 in 2020. Japan , out of all indexes , hard to be bear when even that part of world working \n\n4.  QQQ\n\n\u201c Rising rates are bad for tech \u201c bullshit , sure some idiotic things will be killed , sorry if you decided to go all in on car company valued at 1 mil per car sold ever , it\u2019s probably overpriced but we don\u2019t care, find support group where you tell each other in circles how it\u2019s tech/energy/ self-driving company , for other people exhibit A:\n\nLast rate hike cycle and rates going up, fall 2015 to fall 2018, rates were up 40% on relative basis , QQQ was up 90%+, so tech will be fine but some priced to perfection and overhyped stocks will be killed, oh well , they all did insane 2020, don\u2019t feel bad for them \n\n5.  Absolutely insane amount of Fiscal support for masses\nIn 2008 we saved banks and let everyone get killed, in 2020 we send people UBI checks , didn\u2019t let them get for closed on, expanded unemployment benefits and gave tax breaks for people with kids, it could never be more different then last recession and it\u2019s hard to be a bear when Americans have the highest savings rate in the history of this country ever with trillions of $$$ of liquidity flying around the world looking what assets to get into \n\n\n\nIn the early days of the Twentieth Century, when J.P. Morgan ruled Wall Street, a visitor came to the City. He was a long-time friend of Morgan, a commodity trader from Chicago. He was what might be called a \u201cperma bear\u201d following the Panic of 1907. No matter how high or low the stock market went, his outlook was pessimistic. Another crash, panic and depression were just around the corner.\nThis was his first visit to the world\u2019s greatest city. He arrived at 23 Wall Street, and was ushered into J.P.\u2019s spacious office overlooking the Exchange on one side and George Washington\u2019s statue on the other.\nThey immediately began talking about the markets, Morgan being bullish as ever, and his commodity friend being as bearish as ever. \u201cJ.P.,\u201d he said, \u201cthe news overseas doesn\u2019t look too good.\u201d\n\u201cA buying opportunity!\u201d responded Morgan.\nAfter an hour of friendly disputing about the markets, Morgan invited his guest to join him for lunch. They walked outside and started moving up toward Broadway. As they did so, his friend couldn\u2019t help but admire the skyscrapers that dotted the Manhattan horizon. Morgan gave him a tour of the giant buildings, pointing out the Singer Building, the Woolworth Building across from City Hall, the famous three-sided Flatiron Building, and the recently completed Met Life Tower, rising 50 stories high, the tallest skyscraper in the world at the time.\nHis friend was duly impressed,. He said he had never seen anything like it, not even in Chicago.\nFinally, J.P. Morgan stopped his friend and said, \u201cFunny thing about these skyscrapers \u2013 not a single one was built by a bear!\u201d\n\nPositions :\n\n100% stocks since 2012, mix of VTI and VXUS , 2% BTC",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve had an up and down ride with options but I\u2019ve generally had success. After the September correction, I really felt like I had a strategy mapped out and I was confident I had the hang of things. At the beginning February, I was up nearly 500% since December. Hit home runs in ad tech with APPS, MGNI, PERI, others. Adding cash to catch the dip clearly wasn\u2019t a good idea. During this correction I\u2019ve lost all my profit and then some. I was never in any ridiculously short-dated calls, but being 100% in tech and not properly hedged cut my positions in half. I tried to snag several dips that I was confident in on oversold tech like PYPL and AAPL and just got my ass handed to me. It\u2019s upsetting because for months I was basically emotionless win or lose, I just stuck to my game plan and accepted any outcome. I\u2019ve started making dumb short term decisions. Held a short position in TSLA today that was gold until I got greedy, just wanting a massive win that I was used to, and ended up closing for a loss. Just an example of some boneheaded moves I\u2019ve made. I know people here are just gonna tell me to step back and get back into the same headspace I was in before, I just needed to vent.

Each of these investments can take over a year to decide on, but cannot be invested in until I have written out the process.\n\nPart of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation to open-source complex information.\n\n\\- Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even RH?\n\n\\- Does the average retail investor understand incentives vs. bias?\n\n\\- Is the average retail investor familiar with fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?\n\n\\- Is an average retail investor familiar with competitive types of manufacturing processes when they invest in technologies like AMD or GE?\n\n\\- Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio?\n\nAt the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m sharing my writing.

It\u2019s going to be difficult to digest the technology behind Square because it asks you to believe the premise that banking is going to change in unforeseeable ways in the near future. I currently work in the Banking-as-a-Service sector as an engineer, so I have some insight that I could offer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA fair amount of people may not know this, but organizations like Stripe, Square, PayPal, and other fintech infrastructures are just network layers over existing banks. For example, Stripe partners with Evolve Bank while Square partners with Sutton Bank. This is a win-win scenario, for now, where banks get to see the benefits of technology distribution powers, while tech companies gain a shortcut to regulatory requirements.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt may help to accept this by understanding the idea that drives the financial technology sector. In order to distribute financial services to people, regardless of net worth, **trustworthiness and accountability must be established**. These are regulatory frameworks developed by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), Anti Money Laundering (AML) or Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) that are also challenged by such technologies like B\\*tcoin, where validation is arbitrary and based on advanced fingerprinted privacy. This trustworthiness is also the reason why you\u2019re able to instantly invest in your RH account - you are a trusted user and there is no reason to believe that you are somebody else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img shluc14va1n61...*\n\nJust take Charlie Munger's advice to inverse. If these new currencies are bad because they cannot detect crime, then it means that you belong to a system that assumes you are untrustworthy first. These relationships are constantly monitored in things like credit score, loans, and other means of securing wealth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The KYC Solution](https://preview.redd.it/2oueufhxb1n61.png?width=1457&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b3d6e4bb85aa337ed3a0f581929b4d8c2e70eed)\n\nIt is, then, no secret as to why Square invested in B\\*tcoin. There are other reasons, even cultural, as to why they did, but the basic root behind the decision is that it allows research into new verification methods that makes shipping financial services even more frictionless. It is a potential vector for changing the rules of the game and leveling the playing field, so to speak. Being a software-first bank allows you to distribute at a much more rapid pace than a traditional large bank. To be totally frank, the American banking industry has quite a brutal history. Enter Jay-Z.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Black American Enterprise](https://preview.redd.it/xbdw0cnxa1n61.png?width=1006&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32e45ab15c55d54201f82e349bb86594c74cb68c)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ss98jxya1n61.png?width=1082&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=500ac4256347d8810ac273321f726ad42e466696\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn short, The fuel of fintech is the underbanked. The combustion engine that burns it is cybersecurity and AI to validate that a user is trustworthy each time they commit a transaction. This is known as the KYC Problem and how each organization approaches the regulatory requirement to verify that a user is not committing fraud will determine the outcome of who dominates the fintech sector. This is also why you see customer-service as a pervasive problem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hxtz1n00b1n61.png?width=1772&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd766d326a1d46368526d32f4701c209ca90397c\n\n# The Underbanked\n\nJack Dorsey is an interesting character, who views on technology can be highlighted\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The playbook](https://preview.redd.it/1eiwe2j1b1n61.png?width=1494&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f81927188476f40d136d884d18be7a5cb172ef49)\n\nInterestingly enough, Twitter is used in such a manner. The Tweet system these days gets shared across all social media platforms due to its simple design and even appears interactively during sporting events or billboards.\n\nIn my view, Jack Dorsey sees the current period of time as a turning point in internet communications and the underbanked. It is clear as day in its marketing strategy, where Square seller services is marketed strongly toward immigrants and minority America. while Cash App is strongly marketed toward young, first-time banking customers.

Southern USA generally sees less banking due to increased poverty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Underbanking strategy](https://preview.redd.it/xruw28aib1n61.png?width=2949&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58c21fefe36277359c1d37adfa86b592d009af52)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is clear as day and the reason is due to the nature of the demographics of underbanked users. You see, access to banking is not much different than access to the internet or access to clean water.  That is, the closer you are to poverty, the closer you are to lacking access to basic resources. What is interesting about Square\u2019s youth and culture strategy is that it builds a life-long trust with the org. You\u2019ve heard it before, \u201cwhy doesn\u2019t school teach us important thing like taxes or investing?\u201d. Square is attacking that pulse in its design. It offers:\n\n1. The ability to start a business\n2. The ability to invest and educate in basic stocks\n3. The ability to invest and educate in B\\*tcoin\n4. The ability to save on basic purchases\n5. The ability to file taxes (not yet, but the company acquired the means to)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Reality](https://preview.redd.it/hb2b2zljb1n61.png?width=1402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5aa1cce454480fe56d30489feeae3a52809dc559)\n\nWhat this inevitably means is that we probably won\u2019t even see Square operating at \u201cfull-force\u201d until at least 2030 and beyond, as these early aged customers grow with Square and embed more of their financials.\n\n# Speculation\n\nThis is what I expect after examining regulatory environments, product quality, and competitive outlooks:\n\n1. Square will either acquire Sutton Bank or reduce its dependency on Sutton Bank\u2019s regulatory offerings.\n2. Square will become a bank to avoid direct competition with Big Tech, while competing aggressively against Big Banking by offering the ability to ship financial services.\n3. The way they will achieve this is by developing a stronger form of cybersecurity and AI that will allow a smoother verification process.\n4. Square will develop an internet railway, where exchanging currency will be accessible in different mediums like video-games or streams that may compete with organizations like Visa or MasterCard.\n5. Square will compete with Banking-as-a-service and checkout offerings like Stripe, Plaid, and Shopify.\n6. Square will foray into equal housing.\n7. Square will improved loan systems.\n8. Square will enter taboo markets like cannabis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease follow for more content.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/reviews/06hGKT6YUeRY99vz4MVPPh0-7..1569477220.jpg](https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/reviews/06hGKT6YUeRY99vz4MVPPh0-7..1569477220.jpg)",

If you invest based on what I say alone, you are definitely retarded. \n\nIf you have been following weed investing, you will notice that despite superior earnings and performance, US cannabis trades for less and in relatively low volume.

The Senate Majority leader, Chuck Schumer, has recently rekindled the idea about passing the SAFE act.  This would allow these companies to use major banks if they are in legal states.  Besides the fact that this would enhance their ability to set up shop around the US, think about what this could mean for companies looking to go global like Curaleaf.\n\nhttps://www.marketplace.org/2021/02/26/will-congress-consider-giving-marijuana-companies-access-to-big-banks/\n\nI don't know if legalization is around the corner, but frankly I don't care.

        "selftext": "There have been a good number of other posts about how GME's valuation is not crazy, and this will be much the same - I just want to raise more awareness about this. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice, I simply have a wife with several boyfriends. \n\nSo, most people think that GME is overvalued because of how quickly it has risen, fallen, and risen again. Today, at this very moment, yes GME is overvalued at this price, but I believe that its current price could go much higher on fundamentals and future growth, and here's why: \n\n**Price and Market cap:** So, yes, the $250 + price seems super high but I think that's because most people only consider the literal share price and not the market cap. Most new retail trades see this price and think that it's crazy because GME's stock price is higher than AAPL and many other bluechip stocks, but the stock price is not what matters, market cap is. GME's current market cap is about 18B. For comparison, AAPL and AMZN market caps are 2.3 and 1.5 trillion respectively. So for new traders, look at the market cap for valuation, not the actual stock price. Most companies that rise significantly in stock price usually split shares and once GME's price stabilizes, I believe that they will too but that's not what we're talking about right now. \n\n**Potential**: Before the squeeze, GME's market cap was hovering in the very low billions (between 1-4 billion). Since then, it has obviously exploded because of the crazy short interest and the famous squeeze. However, since then, I believe that GME is becoming a legitimate value play. Ryan Cohen is a fucking genius and he is intent on shifting GME to a gaming e-commerce GIANT. I think that the reason GME is going up so much right now (it's increasingly healthily not parabolically) is because Wallstreet is starting to see it as a value play as well. If GME can capture the gaming market, part of the gambling market, and parts of the e-commerce market (related to gaming), there's no reason why its valuation couldn't increase significantly above what it is today. Again, Ryan Cohen is an absolute genius when it comes to e-commerce, and I think that people are starting to see that he could turn this company around. Let's say that in a few years, he turns GME around and it gets a market cap of $100 billion, which would put the stock at roughly $1500 (assuming no splits happen). This is why I'm saying that a $1000 + price target is not insane by any means. Now, the only way for that to happen in the short term is for more squeeze activity to occur, but I'm talking long term. I truly believe that with the leadership of Ryan Cohen, this stock could move in a similar way to TSLA (sustained, rapid growth over a long period of time) (and I am not saying that it will have the same market cap as TSLA, it won't, I'm saying the way the stock moves could be similar). That's why I don't consider Hodl to be a meme anymore. I think that GME is truly a good long-term hodl because of its imminent transformation, potential markets, and future fundamentals. \n\n**DFV**: I also want to address DFV. I personally think that when DFV first got into GME he did it for 2 reasons: 1. he saw that it was grossly undervalued (this was before Ryan Cohen) and 2. he saw the disgustingly high short interest and thought there could be a squeeze. Well, he was right on both of those things. Michael Burry also saw similar potential when he invested before the squeeze. As we all know, DFV has consistently increased his position in GME and has hodled through all of the ups and downs. He even doubled down after the senate hearing. Do you really think that someone would put millions of dollars into a stock that just got beat down just to stick it to the senators or to make a joke? NO! DFV truly likes the stock as a value play and sees the long-term potential in GME - he's not just in it for the short squeeze or the memes, otherwise, he would've been out last month and wouldn't have doubled down. \n\n**Numbers**: I'm guessing many of you are saying to yourselves \"but uncle Hank, my smooth brain can't comprehend GME going up to $100B without some numbers.\" Well, here you go retard. First, I just want to say that $100B is an arbitrary number that I'm just using to say it can go multiples higher. \n\nHere are some big e-commerce stocks: AMZN, SHOP, BABA, WMT, EBAY, PYPL, CHWY. Here are some popular gaming/gambling stocks: ATVI, PENN, DKNG, BYD. So, all of these stocks have market caps in the 10's or 100's of billions. The e-commerce stocks are particularly appealing to GME because that's where Cohen will likely shift GME to. E-commerce continues to grow exponentially and has only increased because of covid. Gaming as its own industry is also rising dramatically with most of the growth being from digital sales. Finally, as everyone knows, gambling is one of the up-and-coming industries that will only continue to grow with increased legalization (especially sports gambling and other online types of gambling). In 2020, US consumers spent over $800B in e-commerce merchants alone. Global e-commerce sales in 2020 were over 4T and are expected to grow over 500B each year. The video game market is estimated to be over 60B in the US and the global gaming market is estimated to be around 150B. Finally, the global online gambling market is estimated to be about 50B and will only rise more with increased legalization. So what does all of this mean? The potential markets that GME can tap into are worth many, many trillions of dollars. Obviously, GME is not going to capture a large portion of these markets, but what this shows is that GME is attempting to go into several industries that already have HUGE markets and are growing fast, and that if GME can get even a fraction of these markets, it will increase its revenue and thus its valuation by multiples. This means that GME is tapping into markets with HUGE potential customer bases and revenue sources. This is not even to mention the fact that GME is already the go-to brick-and-mortar gaming destination (not a very big factor but it obviously helps some). \n\n**Chewey**: This is my most important point. I believe that Ryan Cohen wants to make GME the Chewey of gaming e-commerce. What did Ryan Cohen do with Chewey? He made Chewey into the go-to pet food/supply e-commerce store. Before Chewey, there wasn't a go-to pet food/supply e-commerce store. He essentially e-commerceified the pet food industry. I believe that his goal is to do the same with GME and that GME has wayyyyyyy more potential than Chewey. As shown above, gaming, online gambling, and e-commerce are much, much larger markets than pet food. GME is also already an established brand, so Cohen doesn't have to start it from nothing. There is also not an established go-to for gaming e-commerce. So, I believe that Ryan Cohen is going to make GME the Chewey of gaming e-commerce, which is a far bigger industry than pet food, and the fact that he is starting with an already established brand and isn't starting from nothing makes this even bigger.  \n\n**Conclusion:** Yeah bitch I like the stock. $1500 is not a joke. I want to emphasize that the only way for GME to get to $1500 in the short term is with more squeeze activity, which I am obviously rooting for. But long-term, I believe that GME will be well above the current price of $260ish. Do I still think the squeeze will happen and do I want it to happen? You bet (check my post history for proof). Though I am rooting for another squeeze, however, I also see the long-term potential in GME as a value investment as I think DFV and many others now do as well. Again, I am not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice. I simply have a wife with a boyfriend who sometimes lets me out of my cage and occasionally takes me for walks without my leash.",

This will create demand for new purchases.\n\no Marvel: It is expected that Marvel will be releasing about 5 new television shows on Disney + this year and another 5 films theatrically.\n\no Games: Several hot game properties will be releases later this year that will create more content from which to create Funko toys\n\no Other: Funko is always making deals for new IP licenses and expects to make a \u201cmajor master toy announcement\u201d fairly soon\n\n\u00b7 Loungefly and Snapsies product lines continue to grow and provide additional avenues for Funko to drive more sales growth\n\nFUNKO THRIVES DURING THE PANDEMIC\n\n\u00b7 Despite many major releases throughout the pandemic beyond The Mandalorian, Funko was still able to drive significant purchase activity of it\u2019s brand and products\n\no Evergreen content represented 68% of sales. (Evergreen content is essentially licensed properties that don\u2019t have a major release associated with them at the time. For example, Harry Potter and The Office would be examples of Evergreen Television properties sold last quarter.)\n\no As the economy opens up, Funko expects more properties to become available for licensing and product development\n\n\u00b7 Funko was able to accelerate its move to create a direct-to-consumer website for Funko products in Europe ahead by two years ahead of schedule\n\no FunkoEurope.com was launched in Q4 2020 (October); allowing Funko grow its sales in Europe despite lockdowns\n\no Given that Funko\u2019s direct-to-consumer site just launched, we can expect continued growth back to pre-pandemic levels in Europe over time as Funko drives traffic to its website and countries open back up from lockdown\n\no Five months ago, Funko started in three EMEA countries and has since expanded to eight countries in the region\n\n\u00b7 Funko\u2019s diversification into other products like Loungefly bags and board games help Funko maintain growth during the pandemic\n\no Non-figure products represented 23% of revenues\n\no Funko\u2019s expanded games portfolio grew 50%\n\no Loungefly grew 55% in Q4\n\n\\-- Funko will be expanding its Loungefly relationship with Amazon this year\n\n\\-- Loungefly is seeing strong demand across EMEA and other regions\n\no In board games, Funko launched new titles like Marvel Battleworld, Godzilla, Tokyo Clash, and Back To The Future to name a few\n\n\u00b7 Funko\u2019s overall e-commerce and direct-to-consumer business continued to perform well, expanding on strong Q3 2020 performance\n\no Total direct-to-consumer sales were 8% of revenues in 2020 vs. 4% the prior year\n\no Global mass market and third party e-commerce helped drive growth in 2020 as it represented 35% of sales in 2020 vs. 28% in 2019\n\n\u00b7 Funko adjusted by finding new ways to connect with fans during the pandemic as in-person events like San Diego Comicon were not possible\n\n\\-- \u201cVirtual cons\u201d in connection with Comicon in San Diego, New York, and Emerald City were successful in driving revenue increases\n\n\\-- Social media promotions helped drive increased engagement / awareness\n\n\\-- In lieu of attending New York Toy Fair, Funko decided to host its first ever virtual \u201cFunko Fair\u201d where they partnered with their licensors and retailers to engage fans and launch new offerings.\n\n\u00b7 The event was a big success leading to nearly 1.5 million units being pre-sold to fans through retail partners. Many of those items sold are still six to nine months away from being released.\n\n\u00b7 Funko launched \u201cFunko Pop Albums\u201d in 2020 where they release Pop! versions of classic album covers\n\no For example, the AC/DC\u2019s classic \u201cBlack In Black\u201d record was Funko\u2019s top collectible item at one of their key mass market retailers\n\no Given the strong initial fan reaction, Funko plans to expand the concept across new genres including sports, trading cards, and comic book covers\n\nMULTIPLE ANALYSTS INCREASE THEIR PRICE TARGETS\n\n\u00b7 Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng\n\no Raised the target price 130% to $15.30 (from $6.60)\n\no Q4 EBITDA beat expectations\n\no Impressed by Funko\u2019s ability to pivot during the pandemic by leaning into e-commerce, games, and soft goods\n\n\u00b7 DA Davidson analyst Lind Bolton Weiser\n\no Raised the target price 142% to $17.00 (from $7.00)\n\no Boosting their modeled multiple to 17-times earnings (from 9-times earnings)\n\no Believes the company is returning to growth while improving its fundamentals\n\n\u00b7 Truist analyst Michael Swartz\n\no Raised the target price 38% to $18.00 (from $13.00)\n\no Funko reported a much better than anticipated Q4 and 2021 guidance\n\no Looks well positioned for the year ahead given the strong theatrical line-up, easy comps, product expansion initiatives, and the favorable impact of its high-growth DTC platform\n\n\u00b7 Piper Sandler analyst Erinn Murphy\n\no Raised the target price 46% to $22.00 (from $15.00)\n\no Strong Q4 results\n\n===================================================================\n\n*(At this point my post moves away from more traditional fundamental analysis / information towards more speculative types of things. While I do not really understand the fascination with cryptos nor NFT\u2019s themselves, I do recognize that valuations throughout financial markets have deviated significantly from how I might value them based on more traditional metrics like price-to-earnings ratios or discounted free-cash-flow. Obviously, Tesla, AMC, and GameStop are recent examples of this in the stock market. Crpytos, sports cards, and Pokemon cards are recent examples in other markets (where there isn\u2019t really any cashflow or profit stream intrinsic to the underlying asset from which to determine value). So, if you decide to purchase the stock based on factors outside of fundamental analysis, like momentum and meme-ability, please make sure to position size and be careful. As they say, return-of-capital is just as important as return-on-capital. So, once you move away from fundamental analysis to determine entry and exit into a position, the decision becomes primarily one based on emotion and \u201cgut feel.\u201d Finally, here are two books that I recommend on understanding market bubbles.* [BOOK 1](https://www.amazon.com/Devil-Take-Hindmost-Financial-Speculation/dp/0452281806)*.* [BOOK 2](https://www.amazon.com/Manias-Panics-Crashes-History-Financial/dp/1137525754/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=)*. That\u2019s all for my PSA. I\u2019ll get off my soapbox now and go back to the DD. Thank you for reading. Obviously, the news today that Funko plans to enter the NFT marketplace soon is an important announcement. So any DD without incorporating NFT\u2019s into it would clearly be incomplete.)*\n\n===================================================================\n\nFUNKO MOVING INTO NFTs \u201cFAIRLY SOON\u201d\n\nThere aren\u2019t many publicly traded companies that I can think of at this point playing in the NFT space. You have companies like Square and Paypal getting into cryptos from traditional fintech. You have companies with a core business outside of cryptos like MicroStrategy and Tesla buying Bitcoin for their treasury. Then you have others like Coinbase and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust who were born from the crypto world. But there none I can think of that are tied directly to NFT\u2019s right now other than Funko.\n\n*(If you can think of any other publicly traded companies that have announced their intention to move into NFT\u2019s, please post their names in the comments below. Thank you.)*\n\nAfter today\u2019s interview with CEO Brian Mariotti (quote at the end of this section), Funko seems to have the NFT market clearly in its sights. As we have seen with many other crpyto-related stocks, a company\u2019s share price can swing wildly on a small announcement and the volatility can be extreme. If Funko issues a press release or makes a formal announcement about a new NFT product, the share price could move quickly one way or the other. Because of this, there is clearly additional value beyond its core physical Pops and Loungefly businesses that could be added to Funko\u2019s valuation.\n\nI don\u2019t even know how to begin to estimate the potential value of NFT\u2019s on Funko\u2019s stock price. So instead of doing that, I will try to provide some information and research on recent activity in the NFT space. Hopefully this will be useful to you in deciding whether you would like to incorporate NFT\u2019s in the estimate of what you think Funko is worth. \n\nHighlights of recent NFT milestones and news events:\n\n\u00b7 Beeple is the poster child of NFT right now as he recently sold his NFT for $69 million ([Here](https://www.npr.org/2021/03/11/976141522/beeple-jpg-file-sells-for-69-million-setting-crypto-art-record))\n\n\u00b7 NBA launches NBA Top Shots where people can buy NFTs highlights of basketball plays.

Both for Funko and for collectors.\n\no For Funko it allows them to sell into harder to reach markets like Latin America, Africa, and Asia. There are probably wealthy collectors in many countries that want to own Funko and Loungefly products, but don\u2019t have immediate access.\n\no For collectors, it allows them to buy and sell digital items across the world instantly without having to wait on receiving a physical item. There is even the potential for an item\n\n\u00b7 All collectibles and art have concerns with fakes and counterfeits. By using blockchain technology and NFT\u2019s, Funko can reduce the impact of counterfeiters on their business. When someone purchases a rare item, their NFT can serve as certification of its authenticity through the blockchain.\n\n\u00b7 NFT\u2019s allow Funko to move to blockchain based payment systems and tap wealthy investors looking to diversify out of their crypto coin holdings into physical and digital items.\n\no There are many wealthy crypto investors that are looking to park their money in other investments to diversify their portfolio.\n\no Additionally, there are other investors that are not currently investing in cryptos and blockchain that might be interesting in a solution that merges a rare physical item with a rare digital NFT.\n\n\u00b7 NFT \u201cartists\u201d or \u201ccreators\u201d can collect a piece of the revenue each time the specific digital asset turns over. For example, if Funko made an NFT and it was sold 20 times over the course of a year, a company Funko might collect a fee every time the NFT were sold (depending on how the system were structured).\n\no Funko NFTs could be sold directly to the consumer through Funko\u2019s website or (what I think is more likely) through retail partners like GameStop, Target, Walmart, Hot Topic, and other retailers looking to get in on the NFT craze.\n\nQuote from Funko\u2019s CEO [interview](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/funko-ceo-ability-disrupt-nft-151936943.html) about NFT\u2019s:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited about it and we have a plan in place. We have some technology in place. We are going to be out in the market fairly soon. But we\u2019re going to out in the market in a very different way. We have the ability to disrupt this space in a way that nobody else is doing right now. We can tie digital NFT\u2019s to our fan base and link NFT\u2019s with physical products. And that\u2019s not happening right now. So, for example, if you had a pack of NFT\u2019s. I won\u2019t mention licenses. And there are a few rare ones. If you have those rare ones, we\u2019re going to give you a free product that is tied to that rare NFT. Which means you have a super rare physical product that ties to your super rare NFT. That\u2019s disruptive. That\u2019s new. It\u2019s different. It\u2019s only what Funko can do. And we\u2019re really excited about what the future of NFT\u2019s are. We\u2019re certainly all over this. And I think you\u2019ll see fairly soon from Funko in the market.\u201d\n\nTL;DR:\n\nAs expected, Funko had a strong Q4 2020, driven by continued strength in their core product line and e-commerce sales in the US market. Funko\u2019s sales are expected to continue to grow in 2021 as the company builds upon its wins from the second half of 2020. Funko\u2019s international business represents an area of additional opportunity as the company has not fully recovered from sales declines in the region yet. Continued development of Funko\u2019s direct-to-consumer initiatives in Europe along with store reopenings after lockdowns should remedy this.\n\nWhile Funko has not formally announced their entry into the NFT market with a press release, thier CEO's interview with Yahoo Finance suggests that the company soon will. Funko announcing their entry into NFT\u2019s would probably drive more attention to the stock and more investors to Funko products. At that point Funko would become more than just a \u201ctoy company.\u201d They would become a collectibles company making products for the NFT marketplace. Many products made by Funko already command a significant premium in the secondary market.

Imagine what could happen to prices if those same products were combined with accompanying NFTs. This new opportunity with NFT\u2019s provides optionality on an already stable core business of collectible toys, games, and merchandise.\n\nPositions: Long Shares &amp; Calls\n\nDisclosure: I am long FNKO.

        "selftext": "I don\u2019t know if anyone will see this but I had to get this off my chest because it was bothering me. I\u2019m sure Bruce is a nice guy but I am disturbed by his coverage of AMC and him putting down AMC shareholders by calling them amateur traders and pitting AMC against GME.\n\nAs a preface, **I want both AMC and GME to do well** whether one squeezes before the other or they both squeeze at the same time. However, I completely disagree with Bruce\u2019s \u201cfundamental-based\u201d analysis of AMC and think it is utterly misinformed, disingenuous, and reckless.\n\n**A Few Things I find Sketch about Bruce (This is merely my opinion and I don\u2019t mean to offend anyone)**\n\n1.  He asks for donations on PayPal. He does this so that he does not have to pay taxes on that \u201cincome.\u201d Since it is labeled as a donation, which he wants, he doesn\u2019t declare that money but rather pockets the full amount. Other YouTubers do not do this unless I am missing something.\n\n2.  (please let me know if I am wrong about this point) He claims to have no money in stocks, but I find this extremely hard to believe for a few reasons. First off, he said he used to be a stockbroker and people trust his advice because they believe he is a knowledgeable investor. If he is a good investor, he has to have some money in an appreciating asset class, whether that is real estate, commodities, or some other alternative asset. I find it hard to believe he is storing all of his money in cash/savings, especially with ongoing fears of inflation. Being involved with the capital markets for many years now, I would expect that he has investments in the stock market. All I am saying is he never shows his screens, and we will never know the truth. I actually appreciate that the other Youtubers show their portfolio and even though there are biases, it is obvious, and they are upfront.\n\n3.  Finally, call me a skeptic, but Bruce is a salesman by trade. That is what a stockbroker is. Just think about the Wolf of Wall Street and think does this man have your best interest at heart. Maybe he does but the entire PayPal donation and charging 400 dollars for a session sounds fishy to me. No offense, but there are very few people I would pay 400 dollars to talk to and Bruce certainly is not one of them.\n\n**WHY HE IS SO WRONG ABOUT AMC FUNDAMENTALS (I respect those who believe in GME\u2019s bull thesis but please do not put down AMC and its shareholders).**\n\n1.  I don\u2019t care what anyone says but Bruce has not done full DD on AMC and it shows. I don\u2019t know if he believes he will make more money if he simply panders to one audience (GME) or if he genuinely believes what he says.\n\n2.  From an asymmetrical risk to reward ratio, AMC makes more sense for me at this current valuation, whereas I find it much harder to justify GME\u2019s valuation. I know people are in it for the squeeze/momentum, but Bruce likes to talk fundamentals.\n\n3.  People like Bruce love to mention AMC\u2019s debt, and I think it is important, but they fail to realize that it was strategic debt. AMC was investing heavily for the future. They by far have the best and most innovative movie theater experiences in the world with the dine-in setup where waiters take your order at your seat and bring the food to your seat, the incredible recliner seats, Dolby Cinema, etc. Additionally, they were acquiring theater chains in Europe and expanding into the Middle East. This strategic debt has allowed them to separate themselves from the competition and they were not expecting the pandemic to hit and cause such a strain.\n\n4.  AMC is a business with a moat around it. They have 80 percent market share in the US, whereas Cinemark only has around 20 percent, yet analysts say invest in Cinemark because they do not have debt. This is stupidity. People that think AMC is going down simply believe movie theaters will go extinct, which again the numbers show that this is extremely misguided. From 2017 to 2019 pre-pandemic, AMC was having its best years. The box office was in its golden age. AMC was bringing in over 5 billion dollars with growth year over year. People will say it was because of Avengers, but filmmaking is continuing to grow with technological advancements and certain films must be watched in theaters for the full experience. Across the board, we were seeing groundbreaking numbers whether it was horror (Get Out, Us, A Quiet Place, It), films like Crazy Rich Asians, A Star is Born, all of the Kevin Hart and Rock films, all the Disney movies, DC movies, and so much more.\n\n5.  I believe GME has a much tougher road ahead of them. I hope they succeed but they are relying on a pivot into a whole new business model, which is e-commerce where they will face off against giants like Amazon, Target, Walmart, Costco, etc. I also understand that they are trying to become the social and cultural hub for gaming, but there is no guarantee for that as gamers like to be in the comforts of their homes and can interact through mics and chat.\n\n6.  GME folks believe in Ryan Cohen, and we have just as much right to believe in Adam Aron, who is the trailblazer in this industry. He was the CEO of Royal Caribbean and of the 76ers. Also, he has been making deals with production companies/streaming services that everyone fails to mention. He made a first-of-its-kind deal with Universal where AMC will get a portion of their digital rental income. AMC did this by refusing to showcase Universal movies after they said they would simultaneously release films in theaters and on digital rental services. AMC has power as well; remember, the box office is the quickest way for production companies to make hundreds of millions and billions rather than relying on subscriber growth, and AMC charges for screens and takes a chunk of that box office.\n\n7.  Finally, this thought that AMC is going to issue shares and screw us is blatantly false. Adam Aron is on our side and wants us to be successful and also knows if he issues shares, he will lose more money in the long run because he will lose all of this newfound support for AMC just to raise quick money by issuing shares and diluting existing shareholders. Furthermore, the retail investors have a huge say in this now, as we get to vote on any possible share issuance. I actually firmly believe Aron is doing this to screw the shorts as a share recount must be conducted to expose any synthetic and falsified shares. Also, Aron keeps saying they have plenty of cash in the bank and the upcoming movie slate is extremely strong, and also, we have that vote all the way in May, which is not even to issue shares but rather to simply expand the number of shares in the future if they want to issue shares. Bruce should know that there is a long process in order to issue shares. Companies need shareholder approval, as well as a prospectus, receiving an application of shares, allotment of shares, and a call on shares.  You cannot simply come out the next day and do so. AMC was lucky in February as they had the filings already prepared previously, but this supposed share issuance is not worrying any of us AMC shareholders. We can say the same thing about GME but we are not.\n\n**SQUEEZE POTENTIAL FOR BOTH AMC AND GME**\n\n1.  I believe that both are prime squeeze candidates but don\u2019t take it from me. Ihor Dusaniwsky, who is the managing director at S3 Partners, one of the premier data reporting services with regards to short data gives both AMC and GME a score of 10 on his squeeze score metric. Keep in mind he has been doing this for decades now.\n\n2.  Also, with regards to a gamma squeeze, when you look at the volume for the options on barchart, AMC actually has the most volume out of any stock only behind Apple (which is always #1). GME is nowhere to be found at the top of that list, but this can quickly change.\n\nAgain, I never do this kind of thing, but I felt it was necessary. There is so much more I could say but that is already a lot. No disrespect to Bruce but I hope he sees this and reconsiders his outlook on AMC or just the whole movement in general rather than pitting AMC and GME against one another. Hopefully, Trey and him or another YouTuber can talk it out.",

        "selftext": "DISCLOSURE I own 10,000 SHARES of $FTOC may add more or the warrants in the future if price continues to decline. \n\rThe 1 sentence conclusion is that at $11 a share $FTOC seems to provide a good risk/reward. Below I provide a more detailed explanation, the real version would take me 20 pages but this version is for THE REDDITORS!!!\n\rSo, in the past here I have posted about $COTY and $APPH but what many of you may not know about me is that I have been involved in the digital coin and payments space for the past 5 years and have been using Payoneer for years to pay contractors.  Nevertheless, Payoneer is more than that. I understand that at first glance it looks like just another Paypal which is fine because PayPal has been growing and is profitable, even though it took a bit of a hiatus once it was owned by EBAY (Ebay was right to buy them but wrong to not let them grow freely as they could after the spin-off).  \n\rAnyway, I see so many possibilities for Payoneer that I think many are not being considering at all.  Not only is the business going to be growing at LEAST 25% for the next few years but I think it can expand 35% to 50% per year for the next 3 to 5 given the massive shift of online transactions but also new services. To simplify, adding more services to cater their current customers helps them bring in new customers which nets them more revenues and profits. \r\n\nThe issue with Payoneer has been that they never had enough capital to grow or to provide their customers more. It takes a long time to build a really robust and safe payments platform. Payoneer has been around for more than 10 years and it took a lot of capital and development hours to get to where they are today.  The business was limited to transactional growth which is fine but when that is like a profit of like 0.5% (as most goes to the credit card companies or banks) it is hard to grow or ever be profitable.  So, Payoneer for years has been in this stunted growth because of lack of capital or because they are in markets that were \u201chigh risk\u201d, like not being in the USA vs. being in the Ukraine.\n\rI think there are many reasons they did a SPAC and if I were to top it off it is because they failed to do an IPO a long time ago, capital is expensive via private transactions and it would never be enough.  So, yes they could have done raises of $50mm every year but in this type of industry when you have so many competitors who have tens of billions of revenues and hundreds of billions of transaction volume you need a lot more to be able to compete.  $500 million makes you a pretty major player in the game vs. struggling with small raises.  Definitely not ideal for shareholders but in the long-term it is the best way to assure your business can compete at the very least survive.   \n\rWhen I usually look into these stock ideas or analysis I go through a process but here on REDDIT I feel I need to provide a sort of cliffs notes because I can really go into a deep dive analysis of like 10 to 20 pages to really understand the entire business, how it makes or loses money. So I will to the best of my ability be concise but deep with my knowledge of the business. \n\rBusiness model\rHere are all of the products that Payoneer offers its customers. \rGlobal Payments, Multi-currency account, physical and virtual cards, B2B accounts payable and accounts receivable, working capital, merchant services, compliance and tax. \n\rSo, it is basically a bank that includes an accountant to help meet a business\u2019 needs. The one product or feature that is missing is digital coins and no doubt they will be offering that soon, if anything they should make that a major priority. \n\rWho are their customers and where are they know?\r5 million businesses in 190 countries. Customers include Amazon, Wish, Lazada (owned by Alibaba) Shopee, and Ebay. Weird right, they work with Ebay given Paypal does too.  This is because they work with countries and specific clients that Paypal not accept into their platform. Investors need to understand that sometimes people have to use other platforms because they the Paypal\u2019s or banks are NOT willing to take the risk.  Sure the risk is probably higher but the amount of people that need access to capital or payment process is high when many banks in many countries do not approve people for such type of access.  \n\rWhat are the growth drivers?\rAcquisition in new or existing markets (which drives better margins) and working capital for some of their customers (not all) which is what helps Amazon and Paypal grow their business.  When someone makes a transaction say buyer and seller the bank or credit card companies make fees but when both consumer and business use Payoneer exclusively they avoid transaction fees with banks which is why these platforms push or provide discounts for encouraging transactions within the same network vs. out of network.  Over time more and more transactions will be within network, just takes more people to be part of the ecosystem. \n\rWhat are the revenues of the business? Company estimates. \r2020  $346mm\r*2021 $432 mm\r*2022 $540 mm\rWhat do I think actually happens?\r2020 $350 to $400mm\r2021 $450 to $550mm\r2022 $600 to $700mm\rWhy?  Because $500 million of capital allows you to expand faster than before and I think the management has been prudent not to be so aggressive in their esimtates because I don\u2019t think anyone can believe they can so more than 35% a year but I do.  \n\rWhat does that say about valuation? \rWell, Paypal at its spin-off inception traded as low as 5x revenue but growing 15% to 20% a year and when it had $11 billion in revenues now it is growing same rate but trading at 15x Revenue. That means that given Payoneer is growing double the rate and 95% smaller they can command a higher multiple but for the sake of being \u201cconservative\u201d let\u2019s use 5x revenue as the TROUGH valuation and 20x revenue as the PEAK. \n\r2020  $346mm  Trough is $1.75 billion or $4.60 a share. Peak is $6.92 Billion or $18.21 \r*2021 $432mm Trough is $2.16 Billion or $5.70 a share. Peak is $8.64 billion which is $22.75 a share. \r*2022 $540 mm Tough is $2.70 Billion or $7 a share. Peak is $10.8 Billion or $28 a share. \n\rIf you used my estimates it would be the following\r2021 $450 to $550mm Trough is $6 or Peak of $29\r2022 $600 to $700mm Tough is $7.89 or Peak of $36.84\rGiven the current price of $11 it becomes a 4 up and 1 down scenario, a good risk/reward bet. \n\rWhat do I think the future holds for Payoneer?\rI actually think there are several exits for this company. \r1.\tCompany continues to grow and eventually reach billions or revenue within 5 to 10 years. So many factors and things that can happen since sometimes a 10x of revenue growth does not always mean 10x in stock price, could be -50% (due to massive dilution or debt) or 10,000% (no dilution, growth increasing, becomes a top 5 player).  So consider that when you get too enthusiastic about prospects there is always a downside. \r2.\tLarge international payments processer buys them. Could be Paypal, Square, Stripe, First Data, etc. consolidation WILL happen in this space and I think short-term Payoneer will acquire some companies and then be sold to a bigger company.  Think of this as how banks in the USA were allowed to merge in 1995 given the law that passed.  Before you had 100,000 banks then it was 50,000 banks, then 10,000 banks and now like 5,000 banks but the top 10 banks make up a large % of the business/volume. \r3.\tWildcard: CRM business buys them. What many people do not realize is that CRM\u2019s have been changing the game.  First it was to help you sell with marketing tools, then it is to improve communication within the team, then it will be storage, and legal transactions then it will be financial transaction.  They are literally going to control the beginning to the end of the customer relationship and all of that data they possess is very valuable to help their customers grow. \r\rConclusion:  $FTOC provides a good risk reward and many ways to play the exit depending on your risk tolerance.  \rIf you like my analysis please share with other people and if you want me to look at a company and provide an analysis like this I can do that for a small fee. Nevertheless, I welcome everyone and anyone here to discuss all of the good and bad about $FTOC because that I love about the Reddit community is how open, transparent and sometimes incredibly funny you all are. \n\rGood luck to every one! \rValue Maverick",

        "selftext": "# Summary\n\nAdobe\u2019s powerful position in the professional design and media production ecosystem has given them a valuable foothold in helping their clients get things done. Synergies between Digital Media and Digital Experience will allow Adobe to grow existing accounts as their solutions evolve to support customer operations far beyond creative and marketing.\n\n# Profile\n\nAdobe views its business in two key segments, Digital Media and Digital Experience.\n\nDigital Media (\\~75% of revenue) \u2013 what you probably think of when you hear the name Adobe. Products, services and solutions that enable individuals, teams and enterprises to create, publish and promote their content anywhere and accelerate their productivity by modernizing how they view, share and engage with documents and creative content. Things like Creative Cloud and Document Cloud.\n\nDigital Experience (\\~25% of revenue) \u2013 a comprehensive and integrated platform and set of applications and services through Adobe Experience Cloud that enable brands and businesses of all sizes to create, manage, execute, measure, monetize and optimize customer experiences that span from analytics to commerce. Spoiler: this is where my bull case lies.\n\nIn Adobe\u2019s own words [(Form 10-K)](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/cc/en/investor-relations/pdfs/ADBE-10K-FY20-FINAL.pdf):\n\n&gt;*\u201cBy integrating products from each of these areas, our customers are able to utilize a comprehensive suite of solutions and services that no other company currently offers. In addition, our ability to deliver innovation and productivity improvements across customer workflows involving the creation, management, delivery, measurement and optimization of engaging content favorably positions Adobe as our customers continue to invest in delivering digital experiences.\u201d*\n\n# Fundamentals\n\n|Next Earnings Date|March 23rd (no time given)|\n|:-|:-|\n|Market Cap|$213B|\n|Forward P/E|41.02|\n|Shares|479M (Outstanding), 403.5M ( \\~85% Institutionally owned)|\n|Previous Close (3/12)|$444.30|\n|52WK Range|$255.13 - $536.88|\n|Average Volume|2.6M, so liquid enough.|\n|TAM|Adobe considers its TAM to be $147B by 2023|\n|Revenue Expectations|Plans to surpass $15B of revenue in FY21|\n\n**Inside activity** \u2013 only two small sales in the last 3 months that weren\u2019t automatic or scheduled. Net activity is \\~300K shares sold (mostly automatic)\n\n**Buybacks** \u2013 Adobe has accelerated buybacks and recently increased the board\u2019s share buyback authorization to $15B, as their original $8B repurchase is expected to be exhausted by mid-FY21.\n\n# Climate\n\nAdobe has a formidable moat around its Digital Media business segment, with very few competitors to its creative workflow management solutions. With many offices continuing to work virtually, and companies continuing to invest in their creative infrastructure for remote employees, strong growth in Digital Media should continue. **Whether they love or hate it, every creative professional knows they need proficiency in the Creative Cloud suite, and probably a subscription to it too.**\n\nAs Adobe says in their 10-K and [Annual Shareholder letter](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/cc/en/investor-relations/pdfs/AdobeStockholderLetter2021.pdf), *\u201cevery business is a digital business, and the imperative for customer experience management has never been more real.\u201d* Organizations and brands of every shape and size are wisely looking to improve their digital presence and customer experiences. Whether it's look and feel, project management tools, or e-commerce buy flow \u2013 Adobe has a solution for it. The pandemic only accelerated the trend, when nearly every opportunity to engage audiences went digital. To that end, the **Digital Experience segment stands to become a larger contributor to future revenue growth.** Adobe will successfully cross-sell Digital Experience solutions to existing Digital Media customers (think e-commerce, marketing and analytics tools, project management tools, etc.).\n\nAdobe will also generate new revenue streams from [recently-announced public sector use cases](https://news.adobe.com/news/news-details/2021/Adobe-Partners-With-All-50-US-States-to-Modernize-Digital-Experiences-for-Citizens/default.aspx). These federal, state, and local government partnerships will serve as lighthouse accounts for future growth within government, [healthcare](https://www.adobe.com/customer-success-stories/walgreens-boots-alliance-case-study.html), and other public impact sectors. These are reliable customers that are reluctant to switch solution providers due to baked-in opex approvals \u2013 which makes a SaaS offering incredibly sticky with large institutions.\n\nWhile we're discussing government and healthcare customers, it's really worth mentioning third party resellers. Again, from the [Form 10-K](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/cc/en/investor-relations/pdfs/ADBE-10K-FY20-FINAL.pdf):\n\n&gt;*\"We also distribute certain products and services through a network of distributors, value-added resellers (VARs), systems integrators (SIs), independent software vendors (ISVs), retailers, software developers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). In addition, we license our technology to hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers for use in their products and solutions.\u201d*\n\nTypical multi-channel, large software company strategy. But these third party solutions providers become incredibly important in highly regulated spaces like government and healthcare. With Adobe's [recent acquisitions](https://news.adobe.com/news/news-details/2020/Adobe-Completes-Acquisition-of-Workfront/default.aspx) and [getting FedRAMP approval in 2019](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2019/09/20/adobe-obtains-new-fedramp-authorizations-enhancing-its-digital-government-services-in-the-cloud.html#gs.vn62be), they\u2019ve shown they\u2019re serious about becoming a bigger government and institutional player. These are highly regulated industries, with long and bureaucratic procurement processes. **Often, government and healthcare buyers are only authorized to do business with a handful of pre-approved vendors.** As Adobe continues to integrate and white-label their Experience products to third party partners, they become an increasingly available, attractive option for customers in highly regulated verticals. Inside these organizations, it\u2019s very difficult for buyers at big enterprise and government customers to win large appropriations approvals (to switch or rebuild systems), and much easier to lock in software solutions as a monthly \"cost of doing business.\" As organizations move to opex models like SaaS, there\u2019s even more stickiness than there used to be.\n\n# Technicals\n\nP/E ratio of \\~41.02 seems high, but looking at Adobe\u2019s closest competitors shows they\u2019re not the highest.\n\n|Autodesk (ADSK)|49.28|\n|:-|:-|\n|PayPal (PYPL)|70.72|\n|Salesforce (CRM)|48.45|\n|DocuSign (DOCU)|N/A|\n|SAP (SAP)|29.92|\n|Accenture (ACN)|32.61|\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to find a direct comparison, but I think Adobe\u2019s marketing, analytics and e-commerce ambitions make their P/E getting closer to Salesforce very plausible. Part of Adobe's strength is that there's nobody that directly competes with them on all fronts.\n\n**Analyst Sentiment** \u2013 solid buy sentiment from 23+ analysts, which has gone mostly unchanged in the last few months. Lowest price target is $500, with the average around $560-$570. I have yet to see a sell rating. ([Source](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=ADBE))\n\n**Moving Averages and Technical Indicators** \u2013 I\u2019ll let others chime in here, because this is my weakest area of knowledge. From what I can see, monthly moving averages and technical indicators suggest ADBE is a semi-strong buy and slightly oversold, respectively. I expect positive momentum to accelerate due to trading at 6-month lows leading up to earnings, BidenBux coming through, and the market forgetting about the 10yr Treasury Yield. ([Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ADBE?p=ADBE))\n\nRemember, this was trading at $500 a month ago. While I think this is worth a long term hold, I also think we'll see it pop when they post yet another earnings beat.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nCombined with Adobe\u2019s well-known lock-in for professional design and content production workflows in their Media segment, growing competency in their Experience segment will make Adobe extremely competitive as an end-to-end SaaS provider for public and institutional customers. **Simply put, I believe Adobe\u2019s Digital Experience segment will  grow to be at least half the size of Digital Media, with large enterprise and government partnerships being a sleeping giant in their pipeline.**\n\nPlanning to purchase 4/19 $490c at open tomorrow.",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone long time lurker finally becoming active and posting. I have been investing for under a year now. I am 28 years old with 2 kids... my financial goals is to long term invest for the next 15+ years in order to pay for their education and to buy them each a car when they turn 16. I am currently 76% stocks and 24% ETFs I would like to increase my ETF holdings and decrease the Stock %. My goal is to stay diversified and not overlap as much as i can but also invest in solid companies (i try to avoid the yolo meme stocks). So here is my portfolio with %'s and then my future plans for it. Please give me your best opinions/ advice (cross posted for best results of advice)! \n\nETFs (24%)\n\nQQQj (2.81%), ARKG (0.78%), PRNT (1.66%), ARKK (3.25%), ARKQ (4.26%), ARKF (2.36%), SMG (4.05%), SUBZ (1.25%), ARKW (1.36%), BETZ (1.93 %)\n\nStocks (76%)\n\nDisney (8.38%), Airbnb (6.27%), OPEN (2.45%), Z (6.45%), ROKU (12.82%), Apple (5.3%), NVTA (1%), PYPL (11.03%, SQ (12.18%), TDOC (5.27%), PACB (0.81%), CRSP (2.06%), PLTR (2.16%) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy goals when i do my next buying round this month...\n\nIncrease positions on BETZ, ARKK, ARKW, SMH, ARKG, ARKF, ARKQ, ARKQ, PRNT in order to get all ETFs close to an evenly split percent. which will effectively increase overall portfolios etf percent also. \n\nI also plan to add to my positions of ABNB, CRSP, PACB, NVTA in order to even out my holdings there. Right now i am way too heavy on ROKU (stocks down so just holding it) I am heavy on SQ/ PYPL also but thats on purpose because i believe those are very solid long term. TDOC is actually heavier than i anticipated but will be holding long term. PLTR is my only yolo/ memeish stock i hold. \n\nOver time (next 3-6 months) i plan to add in QQQ to my ETF mix. \n\nSo my question is this... how does it look? I feel like i have touched a few different sectors with fintech, travel, betting/ gambling, streaming/ entertainment, communcation/ semiconductors, geonomics, healthcare, autonomous, innovation, and defense. \n\nI was looking at CIBR/ HACK but felt unsure and i was also looking at adding FIVG/ NXTG but i also felt unsure on these. \n\nWould you add any ETFs, do you think any overlap too much? My kinda goal is to own an ETF and then effectively also own 1-3 stocks in said sector. Like i said my main goal is to add to my ETF holdings first to even out that distribution which right now really isnt too heavy one way or the other which is good and then fill a few more stocks to even that out. I do plan to decrease the ROKU position once that recovers fully which will help with my weight. Stock wise i believe the only ones over time i feel good about adding to on dips would be Apple right now (would like to see it more evenly with SQ/ PYPl) and Disney). \n\nthanks for any input!!",

        "selftext": "Armed with a fresh round of stimulus checks, Americans may be ready to shop...for some bitcoin and stocks.\n\nA new survey out of Mizuho Securities on Monday estimates that 10%, or nearly $40 billion of the $380 billion in direct stimulus checks, may be used to purchase bitcoin and stocks. Mizuho managing director Dan Dolev and his team surveyed approximately 235 individuals with less than $150,000 of household income. Of that, about 200 said they expect to receive the third round of direct stimulus payments in the coming days.\n\nNearly 2-in-5 check recipients expect to use some portion of their checks to invest. And stimulus check recipients prefer bitcoin over stocks, according to the survey.\n\n\"The survey predicts that bitcoin will account for 60% of total incremental investment spend. We calculate it could add as much as 2-3% to bitcoin's current $1.1t trillion market value,\" Dolev writes.\n\nDolev says stocks from his coverage universe that should benefit the most from people buying equities with their checks include Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, and Square.\n\nMizuho isn't alone in its call on the use of stimulus checks.\n\nA good chunk of the new stimulus money about to be funneled into American households shortly via the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill may find its way into the stock market, Goldman Sachs says.\n\n\"We expect households will be the largest source of equity demand this year,\" Goldman's chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin wrote recently. \"We raise our household net equity demand forecast to $350 billion from $100 billion, which reflects faster economic growth and higher interest rates than we had assumed previously, additional stimulus payments to individuals, and increased retail activity in early 2021.\n\nThe latest round of stimulus checks will be sizable, hence Wall Streeters optimism some of the funds will find their way into asset classes such as bitcoin and stocks.\n\nRoughly 90% of American households will be eligible for stimulus checks, according to CNN. For those eligible, they stand to receive a $1,400 check.

Medici is a small facet of OSTK's revenue, but it's fascinating what they've been accomplishing. They issued a small dividend a year ago that's up 901.88% at the time of this post. (It's not really a dividend. Idk what the fuck it is, to be honest. They just issued it to me and it grew. Ticker is OSTKO if someone wants to explain it to me.)\n\nTheir main publicly traded competitor is W. W also had a rollercoaster earnings day. Early hours shot way down (jussst enough to trigger my stoploss order) then corrected way up. I think most of everyone saw they had a 16% run-up on Monday. There's yet to be a post earnings run-up for OSTK.\n\nI might lose some apes here, but I'm going to discuss risk/reward. Most recent extreme low was $47 about a month ago. Most recent high was $110 a couple weeks ago. OSTK is now trading at $65ish. Low volume is below most averages and, given the \ud83c\udf08  \ud83d\udc3b news on tech sell-off, it seems to be finding support.\n\nHousing market up also bodes well for the furniture industry. \n\nThis stock has always been for thrill seekers so I'm not going to promise to drink my own piss if it drops further. Positions: 552 shares of OSTK @ 67.13 and 233 shares of PYPL @ $275.4.",

        "selftext": "\\## Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this post is to write out the thought process and analysis of some of my major investments. Each of these investments can take over a year to decide on, but cannot be invested in until I have written out the process.\n\nPart of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation to open-source complex information\n\n\\- Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even RH? \n\n\\- Does the average retail investor understand incentives vs. bias?\n\n\\- Is the average retail investor familiar with fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?\n\n\\- Is an average retail investor familiar with competitive types of manufacturing processes when they invest in technologies like AMD or GE? \n\n\\- Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio?\n\nAt the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m sharing my writing. I\u2019m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\## TL;DR\n\nInvesting in gaming is to invest in metaverse technology. Whether the company is Microsoft, Roblox, Unity, or Adobe, the goal is to develop genuinely sophisticated technology to be able to develop and transform ideas into something useful. This has enormous consequences in education, construction, and media.\n\nRoblox is Robot Blocks, a game born out of a physics and education product. I relate to this strongly because I develop a product called ROBE, or Robots Building Education - a math, programming, and financial learning system that rewards schools with hybrid-learning. It's purely coincidence, but the education technology market is extremely nascent, misunderstood, and enormously challenging.\n\nThe key to success in education technology is to capture engagement, attention, wonder, and joy. Some readers here may reminisce on such experiences where games like World of Warcraft or Runescape taught an individual how to type, multiply, interact, or barter.\n\n\\## Gaming\n\nMost people understanding video-gaming in the most traditional sense: some virtual reality technology that is fun and entertaining. They are the digital theme parks, where the longer a customer stays, the more likely a customer will spend. What many people do not consider are the long-term consequences of such technology. Gaming is truly consequential in such industries like:\n\n\\- Architecture, engineering, and construction\n\n\\- Automation technology\n\n\\- Learning experiences\n\n\\- Cinematography\n\nIt may feel strange, but it's true. Companies like:\n\n\\- Sony, who develop games like Need For Speed, also develops image sensors and EV technology.\n\n\\- Unity, the bedrock of Among Us, is directly competing with Autodesk in engineering firms. \n\n\\- Roblox, in many ways, competes with Facebook in the attention economy.\n\nIn the end, the total addressable market of the gaming sector is larger than imagination itself and it takes time to understand how this may all tie together.\n\n\\## Roblox\n\nA big question that makes investors nervous is that they cannot imagine or calculate how a company like Roblox will achieve profitability. This is largely due to not being able to understand the scope of the 3D-modelling industry. It helps to understand the background of the CEO, David Baszucki.\n\nIn short, David's goal is to capture customers for the long-term and develop a platform where learning comes naturally. This is obviously not a means to replace education, but a partial enhancement to it. You may recognize such challenges, where students often struggle through complex subjects like math, physics, or computer programming and where such struggles translate to real market consequences and labor shortages. These things begin early in childhood and beyond.\n\nSo to invest in Roblox is to believe that Roblox as a video game is a digital metaverse that is focused on education. It's not like Disney or Nintendo, that try to capture imagination, or is it like Blizzard that tries to capture imagination. Roblox is very simply a game with an education angle, much like Legos and Hot Wheels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/110829967-89beaf00-824d-11eb-85ff-6ee96879bc92.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/110829967-89beaf00-824d-11eb-85ff-6ee96879bc92.png)",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ll try and keep this as short as possible with a little background since it\u2019s a specific circumstance. My Mom is a Financial Advisor of 25+ years and has raised me to invest, buy and hold, diversify, etc. She doesn\u2019t buy individual stocks and only invests in Mutual Funds and ETF\u2019s mostly because my Mom and Dad\u2019s age (65/60) and risk level. I always had her put me in Science and Technology and it\u2019s done very well to say the least. I am generally knowledgeable of the market and understand the risks involved.\n\nI am now 26 and working from home. I work in Sales for a TV sports network and make $80,000/yr. I have a stable income. I am obviously much riskier than my Mom and currently have $54,000 in shares of extremely high risk,  volatile stocks (TTD, AMZN, AAPL, MSFT, ABNB, FSLY, PINS, FB, PYPL, SE, SHOP, SQ, MELI, DDOG, ARKK) and around 25 more tech, e-commerce, and infrastructure stocks. The problem is I had saved $30,000 the past year and bought a lot of tech last Monday. Needless to say it got bumpy and my Mom offered me a deal when my account got to $48,000 (16% in 2 days):\n\nNow for the StoNKs advice:\n\nDEAL: Guaranteed my $61,000 original investment if I do not invest any more money this year and simply hold investments of some kind until the end of the year. IF they are above $61,000 at the end of the year, we will split any profits 50/50. \n\nI am looking to buy a house the beginning of next year so this is around a 6-9 month window. What stocks would you invest in for the remainder of 2021? Would you be extremely risky and tech heavy since that money is guaranteed anyways?",

        "selftext": "Good afternoon Degenerates,\n\nFirst, to cut right to the chase, we're not going to be talking about Dell Inc. Well, we are. But the actual company of focus for this DD is a spunky little Micro-EV play that you might know by the name Aye Why Are Owe. But I'm not particularly eager to make it too easy for bots to scrape my posts, so you'll have to put on your thinking caps and find your way to the ticker by yourself. I'll be using the ticker $DELL, to discuss this play as it relates to the camouflaged stock, and write \"Dell Inc.\" when making references to the actual computer manufacturer.\n\nFirst, if you haven't been paying attention to this stock, I'd highly recommend getting caught up on other DD posts that lean more into the financials.  This post is more an outline of my thesis on why this is the EV play I've chosen. \n\nOther Helpful DD Posts:\n\n* Quick and dirty [https://www.reddit.com/r/smallstreetbets/comments/lt7w7e/ayro\\_smallcap\\_ev\\_recovery\\_play\\_with\\_high\\_short/](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallstreetbets/comments/lt7w7e/ayro_smallcap_ev_recovery_play_with_high_short/)\n* Deeper, but dated (A lot has happened since this post):\n   * [https://www.reddit.com/r/thecorporation/comments/lf4jsc/ayro\\_the\\_most\\_underwritten\\_ev\\_play\\_on\\_the\\_market/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thecorporation/comments/lf4jsc/ayro_the_most_underwritten_ev_play_on_the_market/)\n\nRecent Happenings:\n\n* $20M Direct offering (January 2021)\n\nFuture Happenings (Potential Catalysts):\n\n* EV Roadshow (See [https://www.vaccineev.com/](https://www.vaccineev.com/))\n   * Confirmed Meeting with Atlanta Governor's Office: [https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6775760411619856384/](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6775760411619856384/)\n* Earnings Upcoming (Estimated 03/12 or 03/26 depending who you ask)\n   * I'm expecting positive news here because $DELL released targeted offerings in response to the Pandemic which we don't know the impact of yet. They're also less likely to be impacted by other EV market down-pressures like the chip/supply chain shortages due to the relative simplicity of their vehicles.\n\nNow let's assume you're going to skip all of that suggested homework and dive right in. Here's the TLDR scoop about \"$DELL\", they are a manufacturer of highly-customized light-duty electric vehicles. They've built their business around tailoring their vehicles to specific-use markets; food delivery, recreational transport, food trucks, pop-up clinics, short-haul transportation delivery, etc. They're focused primarily on design and marketing, from what I can tell, and they've made strategic partnerships on the manufacturing side to enable delivery and sales.\n\nSo, why are we talking about Dell Inc. today? Well, I originally wrote this comparison as a reply to a more bearish comment on another thread, and the more I've thought about the comparison, the more it's increased my convictions in my $DELL position.\n\nAre you old enough to remember Dell Inc. in the early-mid-'90s? If you learned about this company as a case study in business school, you probably learned that Dell captured their market and rose to dominance by ruthlessly removing inefficiency from their supply chain. As they found economies of scale, they used their purchasing power to demand more and more from their suppliers, and they were one of the early winners in the just-in-time-supply movement (Before Toyota came along and showed them how it was **really** done). By pressuring their suppliers to be more responsive, Dell minimized their inventory costs, holding fewer manufacturing materials in inventory, reducing the risk of loss from unused parts. They also optimized their internal manufacturing to produce units as close to on-demand as possible (again, reducing the risk of unsold units). Both allowed Dell to drive down their prices and dominate their markets.\n\nBut in my opinion, that's telling the story of Dell computers and starting from the middle. That's telling Dell Inc.'s success story as a result of their economies of scale. Undeniably that became a HUGE advantage. Dell's early understanding of Ecommerce also needs to be given proper credit.\n\nBut I'd argue that starting Dell Inc's story in 1996 misses one of their bigger lessons. In order to achieve economies of scale, a business first has to achieve scale (duh). That's where I want to start my story. Dell Inc did something very, very smart in their early days. In 1990, only \\~20% of US households had personal computers. Dell Inc. went public in 1989 (to a 45% loss that year, I might add). But between the years of 1989 and 1995 if you'd bought Dell Inc. you'd still have enjoyed an AVG rate of return of 72%+/year. Even including taking a -45% bath in year one, and -50% drop in 1993. In that same period, personal computer adoption rose to about \\~35% of US households.\n\nYeah, great - we just said Dell dominated their market; supply chains, economies of scale, e-commerce dominance, yadda yadda. What's your point?\n\nWell, my point is that Dell's website, as some of you probably remember it, and as you probably studied them as a company, didn't come into existence until 1996. After-which Dell Inc enjoyed three consecutive years of +200% (\\~223% AVG) growth. Those were the years that made Dell a now famous, historical case-study.\n\nSo what did Dell Inc do in those first seven years 1989 - 1995 of making only modest 70% annual returns?\n\nI would argue that better than their competitors; Dell realized that they were competing inside an emerging market. They kept their line of offerings limited and configurable - they built PCs primarily as a platform and looked for ways to sell into different niche markets by adjusting their machines' specifications from a common core of offerings. That way, they could target and sell into markets as they developed, rather than hoping single products would either succeed or fail to find product/market fit. They used this strategy to identify and gain leads in markets early. Then by the time 1996 came, they were positioned for the eCommerce transition they made. In 1996, Dell Incs. website launched and allowed computers to be \"custom-built\", not just *per use-case*, but *per-user* to consumer specifications. \"Custom-built\" just meant allowing each user to upgrade or downgrade the base models of their offerings - so suddenly, you're selling the right computer to a student, stay-at-home mom, a fleet of office workers, etc. Between 1996 and 1999 - (Dell's real boom years), PC adoption rose from \\~35% to 50% of households. Dell Inc's Market Cap grew by 40x in that same period. And the rest is history\n\nThat's where Dell Inc's story starts to turn sour. In my opinion, Dell Inc missed the market transition from computers as an emerging market to a luxury/specialty market. They kept on manufacturing computers as an adjustable commodity (to some success for years). But Dell Inc failed to realize computers were becoming an identity item. Players like Apple ate their lunch by moving into markets that were now defined. Apple realized you could win big by selling a specialized **premium** product targeted at each specific identified niche. (If you want to continue this story, then transition to the chart for $APPL in the early/mid2000's, and watch the rise of the iPod, iMac, Macbook, iPhone, etc.).\n\nSo why are we talking about all of this? I would argue that this makes Aye Why Are Owe one of the most attractive EV plays on the market right now. Where are we in the EV product-adoption lifecycle? Are we about to cross the line where EVs become market-dominant? Not even close. Projections disagree, but one I found estimates 2035 before US EV adoption reaches 50% compared to Internal Combustion. And the transition from Combustion to EV is different than the emerging PC market. PCs weren't a replacement product (sure, you could argue they replaced a LOT of products). But a households buying their first PC wasn't looking at an old desktop machine powered by a hand-crank that they'd already invested thousands of dollars into, and realistically had years of usable life remaining.\n\nIt's great that we're seeing the total cost of ownership for a new EV vs. ICEV close/flip. It's excellent that maintenance costs are so much better. That EV fuel costs keep reducing. Vehicle ranges keep extending. And that charging stations are proliferating. But that won't matter to a family like mine until the 2008 Toyota Prius sitting in my driveway is effectively worthless. Overall, that's going to slow adoption.\n\nLet me preface what I say next by admitting I am not an expert in other EV plays by any stretch. And I'm not here to tell anyone their $TSLA, $NIO, $RIDE, $CCIV, or $XPEV or any other ticker is worth less than they think it is. I'm here to tell you why I'm buying \"$DELL\" on the cheap as fast as I can.\n\n$DELL seems to have realized the position of the EV market in the US better than anyone else. At least for an emerging player.\n\nIf you compare them to $TESLA, Tesla went directly after a market they were confident would exist, and they did an excellent job of it. Their decision, in hindsight, makes really good sense - they immediately positioned themselves as a luxury product. They chased that market first, because it was all but certain to exist, and further increased their odds of success by targeting users more likely to be early adopters and have the disposable income to transition first/early to EVs, just to prove they were the badest kids on the block. But Tesla had deep pockets with Elon's backing right from the get-go, not to mention a high-profile visionary founder, serial entrepreneur, and member of the Valley's ultra-connected \"PayPal Mafia\". It was a **really** good bet. But not a bet that just anyone was in the same position to make.\n\nOther Major EVs are on similar paths. There are just enough players now for us to say; \"ok, they're going after luxury, that guy is going after pickup trucks, these companies are going after mid-market...\"\n\nOr, we can argue charging is the future! No overall range is the linchpin! Or no, the key is battery swapping!\n\nThere's going to be significant value in capturing or defining any of those markets. And you can get into any number of a long list of stocks if you're confident that one of them is going to capture dominance early - it's certainly worked for some, and it'll be hard to dislodge these early segment owners like Tesla once they're entrenched. But getting to that place of dominance is hard. And then you have to protect that dominant position for YEARS while you essentially wait for the market to fully develop around you. Doing all that before turning profitable; is risky.\n\nTo say nothing of the recent volatility hitting the sector as fear hits of rising capital costs. Put simply, it's more expensive to be an unprofitable long-term speculative company when credit is more expensive.\n\nSo, why $DELL? Because AYE WHY ARE OWE is the only player I've found intelligently positioned themselves to identify NEW markets. This makes a lot of sense. $DELL doesn't invest in vehicles; they're investing in a vehicle platform(s) of light-duty trucks, food delivery vehicles, and small passenger cars. If you look at their lineup, they really only offer a selection of different products customized from a common core of just a few systems. Sound familiar yet?\n\nWhy does this strategy make me excited about Aye Why Are Owe?\n\nThis approach allows $DELL to move quickly into new markets and test products against existing competition. (Think short-haul logistics vehicles used on college/hospital campuses). Without much overhead, they can adapt their core product to best compete in these smaller niche markets. These smaller markets they're targeting also have a sales-advantage; you can sell *fleets* to institutions instead of trying to change consumer sentiment one sale at a time. And suppose your *platform* sets you up to customize your offering to fit each institution's needs efficiently. Now you can suddenly make a larger, very targeted and application-specific sales-pitch with minimal R&amp;D risk.\n\nThese early target vehicles chosen by $DELL also happen to have shorter life-spans, and when you're shopping for a *fleet* of vehicles, you're much more likely to be concerned about the payoff timescales where $DELL is already very competitive. If you own one vehicle, do you care if it saves you $200/year on maintenance? Probably not. But do you care more if you own 200 of those vehicles? I bet you care about 200x as much.\n\nThe second platform advantage for $DELL is it also positions them to make low-risk plays into the creation/discovery of **new** markets. Frankly, you don't even have to use your imagination here - we saw \"$DELL\" do this twice in the past year alone. First announcing partnerships to aim vehicles at offering indoor/outdoor food service trucks on college (and other) campuses. Check the timeline for how long it took them to get from point A (start of enduring lockdowns) to point B (targeted service offering).\n\nAnd we saw it AGAIN just in the last two weeks with the rollout of the EV vaccine vehicle and the roadshow that's now underway.\n\nThis approach is **smart!** If they don't sell a single vaccine EV vehicle, I will still place a small gentlemen's wager with who anyone who wants it.\n\nI'd be willing to bet the total R&amp;D/Production/marketing/travel cost of this entire roadshow will cost the company less than the free advertising and name recognition they've already generated, including costs to design and manufacture their prototypes. After all, it's just a Dell computer with different accessories, an upgraded cooling system, and a sweet new paint job. Even if it's a total **flop,** and they sell a literal zero COVID-19 units, they can test the same vehicle for mobile blood collection, flu clinic operations, or community health vehicles, EMS/disaster response... Are you with me yet?\n\nThe third big advantage of this approach is that it's much cheaper to be the first-mover into a market that's forming than is is to dislodge an existing solution. **But**, there are significant risks in identifying new markets. Compare the examples of $DELL above, and then think about Telsa's Cybertruck. Again, I'm not looking to shit on any other EV company or product. I don't know anything about the Cybertruck. As proof, when I posted this similar argument as a comment last week, I literally called it the \"Hypertruck\" by mistake. That should tell exactly you how educated I am on this particular product.\n\nAll I want you to do is think about the R&amp;D, Marketing, Testing, Focus Grouping, Design, Supply Change Preparations, and Manufacturing investments that went into the design of that truck. Maybe it's a perfect slam-dunk again, and it all pays off. Telsa is basically saying; we're going to take a whole bunch of money and spend it on creating, designing, and investing into the stickiest piece of spaghetti we can dream up. Then we're going throw it against the wall (market), and see if it sticks! If it does, we print billions. If it doesn't, well, we'll just get to work on designing our 2022 spaghetti and hope we learned what we needed to. Obviously, it wouldn't all be money down the drain. Even a flop could help Tesla create new valuable IP for future products, and infrastructure upgrades don't just evaporate. You can do this kind of R&amp;D when you have deep pockets and investors willing to defer profitability because of your long-term prospects and historical win record.\n\nAye Why Are Owe ($DELL) is taking a different approach though. They're positioning to spend a lot less money to cook a whole bunch of spaghetti. Then they can throw the whole damn bowl at the wall, step back and say; \"Oh look, that noodle stuck!\", Let's go explore why!\" That's why I get optimistic when I hear the CEO say they're approaching restaurant chain operators with vehicles designed on their *platform* that are being custom-built to meet that vendor's needs, *as they're working to define them*. With food delivery demand on the rise, and commissions extracted by 3rd party carriers topping 30%+ there's big potential upside here, and I want to bet on the most **adaptive** company I can find to be ready to identify and tap these emerging markets.\n\nFinally, the last advantage I'd highlight is that *platform* improvements scale easily to *fleet* improvements under this business model. As technology offered on their platform improves, the whole fleet of offerings can improve. And new capabilities open up new opportunities to test for new possible markets. It's a virtuous cycle, and the CEO has publicly stated several times already we'll see significant platform improvements in their line of 2021 vehicles, in terms of range, charge times, and onboard features.\n\nIn closing, I want to make one more counter-comparison. $DELL is certainly not alone in the micro-EV space. But I don't see other players taking this same systematic approach to market-identification. There are others players going directly for the joy-rider market, the food delivery market, the smart-car market, or the special utility markets. Again, I don't know enough to say if any of them are good or bad plays. **Please, don't let me make you feel like your baby is ugly**. But I would point to one symbol $WKHS as a point of further learning. Workhorse got a first-hand lesson on what happens when a small company takes a high-stakes bet on finding a product/market fit within a niche market. When you throw that spaghetti, and it doesn't stick, suddenly the future evaluation of how green the pasture you're headed for can change, and FAST. (It looked about 50% less green apparently once the USPS contract died). As an investor, I know myself well enough to know I don't have that kind of risk tolerance. Maybe you do.\n\nTLDR; I'm about as bullish as I can be on ticker Aye Why Are Owe.  I want to do a follow-up post to look at their financials as well because I'd argue they're **incredibly** underpriced, just given today's performance. To say nothing of future prospects or catalysts.\n\nIf you feel like you're bag holding, stop!  They were a steal at an all-time high of $11.49 IMO. The market just picked the wrong moment to panic, and so far hasn't recognized how different this EV play is from others. The price also still recovering for the latest direct offering, but historically the company has bounced quickly after these events, and they're now flush with Cash.  I'll personally be buying shares as fast as my cashflow allows well into that $11 price, and above.\n\nSources:\n\n* Dell Inc.

Funko looks well positioned for continued growth in 2021 with potential upside from entering the hot NFT market \u201cfairly soon.\u201d (TL;DR at the end)\n\nHere are some highlights from their Q4 earnings report (3/11), Q4 earnings call (3/11), and an interview with the CEO this morning (3/12) with additional information on each bullet further down in the post (For more context please review the prior DDs linked above):\n\n\u00b7  Funko beat expectations with its second highest revenue quarter ever\n\n\u00b7  Growth is expected continue in 2021; driven by Europe, Loungefly, and other initiatives\n\n\u00b7  Operational responsiveness and flexibility has allowed Funko to thrive during the pandemic while providing a way to engage with fans in new and more creative ways\n\n\u00b7  Multiple analysts increased their price targets on the stock after the earnings release\n\n\u00b7  Funko\u2019s CEO Brian Mariotti announced the day after earnings that Funko intends to move into the NFT (Non-Fungible Token) market \u201cfairly soon\u201d\n\nFUNKO BEATS EXPECTATIONS \n\n\u00b7  Net Sales in Q4 2020 was up 6% vs Q4 2019 to $226 million\n\no  This represented Funko\u2019s second highest revenue quarter in its history\n\no  Outperformance was driven by the US market which had its highest revenue quarter in history and grew 18% vs. Q4 2019\n\no  International was constrained by lockdowns; but still grew 10% vs. Q3 2020\n\no  Non-figure product revenue grew 30% in the quarter vs Q4 2019\n\n\u00b7  Gross margins increased 37.2% in Q4 2020 vs. 29.2% in Q4 2019\n\n\u00b7  SG&amp;A decreased 6% to $53 million\n\n\u00b7  Cash Flow From Operations increased 69% to $47 million\n\n\u00b7  Funko\u2019s direct-to-consumer sales nearly doubled compared to the prior year \n\nGROWTH EXPECTED TO CONTINUE IN 2021\n\n\u00b7  Funko is forecasting 30% revenue growth in Q1 2021 (vs. Q1 2020)\n\n\u00b7  Full year sales growth is forecasted at between 25-30%\n\n\u00b7  Gross margin is expected to strengthen in 2021; driven by Funko\u2019s direct-to-consumer initiative and from regional / distribution mix shifts\n\n\u00b7  Full year adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase 120 to 170 basis points to between 13.5% and 14.0%\n\n\u00b7  Many major Television, Film, and other properties held back because of the pandemic are expected to return as the economy opens up. This will create demand for new purchases.\n\no  Marvel: It is expected that Marvel will be releasing about 5 new television shows on Disney + this year and another 5 films theatrically.\n\no  Games: Several hot game properties will be releases later this year that will create more content from which to create Funko toys\n\no  Other: Funko is always making deals for new IP licenses and expects to make a \u201cmajor master toy announcement\u201d fairly soon\n\n\u00b7  Loungefly and Snapsies product lines continue to grow and provide additional avenues for Funko to drive more sales growth\n\nFUNKO THRIVES DURING THE PANDEMIC\n\n\u00b7  Despite many major releases throughout the pandemic beyond The Mandalorian, Funko was still able to drive significant purchase activity of it\u2019s brand and products\n\no  Evergreen content represented 68% of sales. (Evergreen content is essentially licensed properties that don\u2019t have a major release associated with them at the time. For example, Harry Potter and The Office would be examples of Evergreen Television properties sold last quarter.)\n\no  As the economy opens up, Funko expects more properties to become available for licensing and product development\n\n\u00b7  Funko was able to accelerate its move to create a direct-to-consumer website for Funko products in Europe ahead by two years ahead of schedule\n\no  FunkoEurope.com was launched in Q4 2020 (October); allowing Funko grow its sales in Europe despite lockdowns\n\no  Given that Funko\u2019s direct-to-consumer site just launched, we can expect continued growth back to pre-pandemic levels in Europe over time as Funko drives traffic to its website and countries open back up from lockdown\n\no  Five months ago, Funko started in three EMEA countries and has since expanded to eight countries in the region\n\n\u00b7  Funko\u2019s diversification into other products like Loungefly bags and board games help Funko maintain growth during the pandemic\n\no  Non-figure products represented 23% of revenues\n\no  Funko\u2019s expanded games portfolio grew 50%\n\no  Loungefly grew 55% in Q4\n\n\\--  Funko will be expanding its Loungefly relationship with Amazon this year\n\n\\--  Loungefly is seeing strong demand across EMEA and other regions\n\no  In board games, Funko launched new titles like Marvel Battleworld, Godzilla, Tokyo Clash, and Back To The Future to name a few\n\n\u00b7  Funko\u2019s overall e-commerce and direct-to-consumer business continued to perform well, expanding on strong Q3 2020 performance\n\no  Total direct-to-consumer sales were 8% of revenues in 2020 vs. 4% the prior year\n\no  Global mass market and third party e-commerce helped drive growth in 2020 as it represented 35% of sales in 2020 vs. 28% in 2019\n\n\u00b7  Funko adjusted by finding new ways to connect with fans during the pandemic as in-person events like San Diego Comicon were not possible\n\n\\--  \u201cVirtual cons\u201d in connection with Comicon in San Diego, New York, and Emerald City were successful in driving revenue increases\n\n\\--  Social media promotions helped drive increased engagement / awareness\n\n\\--  In lieu of attending New York Toy Fair, Funko decided to host its first ever virtual \u201cFunko Fair\u201d where they partnered with their licensors and retailers to engage fans and launch new offerings.\n\n\u00b7  The event was a big success leading to nearly 1.5 million units being pre-sold to fans through retail partners. Many of those items sold are still six to nine months away from being released.\n\n\u00b7  Funko launched \u201cFunko Pop Albums\u201d in 2020 where they release Pop! versions of classic album covers\n\no  For example, the AC/DC\u2019s classic \u201cBlack In Black\u201d record was Funko\u2019s top collectible item at one of their key mass market retailers\n\no  Given the strong initial fan reaction, Funko plans to expand the concept across new genres including sports, trading cards, and comic book covers\n\nMULTIPLE ANALYSTS INCREASE THEIR PRICE TARGETS\n\n\u00b7  Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng\n\no  Raised the target price 130% to $15.30 (from $6.60)\n\no  Q4 EBITDA beat expectations\n\no  Impressed by Funko\u2019s ability to pivot during the pandemic by leaning into e-commerce, games, and soft goods\n\n\u00b7  DA Davidson analyst Lind Bolton Weiser\n\no  Raised the target price 142% to $17.00 (from $7.00)\n\no  Boosting their modeled multiple to 17-times earnings (from 9-times earnings) \n\no  Believes the company is returning to growth while improving its fundamentals \n\n\u00b7  Truist analyst Michael Swartz\n\no  Raised the target price 38% to $18.00 (from $13.00)\n\no  Funko reported a much better than anticipated Q4 and 2021 guidance\n\no  Looks well positioned for the year ahead given the strong theatrical line-up, easy comps, product expansion initiatives, and the favorable impact of its high-growth DTC platform\n\n\u00b7  Piper Sandler analyst Erinn Murphy\n\no  Raised the target price 46% to $22.00 (from $15.00)\n\no  Strong Q4 results\n\n===================================================================\n\n*(At this point my post moves away from more traditional fundamental analysis/ information towards more speculative types of things. While I do not really understand the fascination with cryptos nor NFT\u2019s themselves, I do recognize that valuations throughout financial markets have deviated significantly from how I might value them based on more traditional metrics like price-to-earnings ratios or discounted free-cash-flow. Obviously, Tesla, AMC, and GameStop are recent examples of this in the stock market. Crpytos, sports cards, and Pokemon cards are recent examples in other markets (where there isn\u2019t really any cashflow or profit stream intrinsic to the underlying asset from which to determine value). So, if you decide to purchase the stock based on factors outside of fundamental analysis, like momentum and meme-ability, please make sure to position size and be careful. As they say, return-of-capital is just as important as return-on-capital. So, once you move away from fundamental analysis to determine entry and exit into a position, the decision becomes primarily one based on emotion and \u201cgut feel.\u201d Finally, here are two books that I recommend on understanding market bubbles.* [BOOK 1](https://www.amazon.com/Devil-Take-Hindmost-Financial-Speculation/dp/0452281806)*.* [BOOK 2](https://www.amazon.com/Manias-Panics-Crashes-History-Financial/dp/1137525754/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=)*. That\u2019s all for my PSA. I\u2019ll get off my soapbox now and go back to the DD. Thank you for reading. Obviously, the news today that Funko plans to enter the NFT marketplace soon is an important announcement. So any DD without incorporating NFT\u2019s into it would clearly be incomplete.)*\n\n===================================================================\n\nFUNKO MOVING INTO NFTs \u201cFAIRLY SOON\u201d\n\nThere aren\u2019t many publicly traded companies that I can think of at this point playing in the NFT space. You have companies like Square and Paypal getting into cryptos from traditional fintech. You have companies with a core business outside of cryptos like MicroStrategy and Tesla buying Bitcoin for their treasury. Then you have others like Coinbase and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust who were born from the crypto world. But there none I can think of that are tied directly to NFT\u2019s right now other than Funko. \n\n*(If you can think of any other publicly traded companies that have announced their intention to move into NFT\u2019s, please post their names in the comments below. Thank you.)*\n\nAfter today\u2019s interview with CEO Brian Mariotti (quote at the end of this section), Funko seems to have the NFT market clearly in its sights. As we have seen with many other crpyto-related stocks, a company\u2019s share price can swing wildly on a small announcement and the volatility can be extreme. If Funko issues a press release or makes a formal announcement about a new NFT product, the share price could move quickly one way or the other. Because of this, there is clearly additional value beyond its core physical Pops and Loungefly businesses that could be added to Funko\u2019s valuation. \n\nI don\u2019t even know how to begin to estimate the potential value of NFT\u2019s on Funko\u2019s stock price. So instead of doing that, I will try to provide some information and research on recent activity in the NFT space. Hopefully this will be useful to you in deciding whether you would like to incorporate NFT\u2019s in the estimate of what you think Funko is worth.

Both for Funko and for collectors. \n\no  For Funko it allows them to sell into harder to reach markets like Latin America, Africa, and Asia. There are probably wealthy collectors in many countries that want to own Funko and Loungefly products, but don\u2019t have immediate access.\n\no  For collectors, it allows them to buy and sell digital items across the world instantly without having to wait on receiving a physical item. There is even the potential for an item \n\n\u00b7  All collectibles and art have concerns with fakes and counterfeits. By using blockchain technology and NFT\u2019s, Funko can reduce the impact of counterfeiters on their business. When someone purchases a rare item, their NFT can serve as certification of its authenticity through the blockchain. \n\n\u00b7  NFT\u2019s allow Funko to move to blockchain based payment systems and tap wealthy investors looking to diversify out of their crypto coin holdings into physical and digital items. \n\no  There are many wealthy crypto investors that are looking to park their money in other investments to diversify their portfolio.\n\no  Additionally, there are other investors that are not currently investing in cryptos and blockchain that might be interesting in a solution that merges a rare physical item with a rare digital NFT.\n\n\u00b7  NFT \u201cartists\u201d or \u201ccreators\u201d can collect a piece of the revenue each time the specific digital asset turns over. For example, if Funko made an NFT and it was sold 20 times over the course of a year, a company Funko might collect a fee every time the NFT were sold (depending on how the system were structured).\n\no  Funko NFTs could be sold directly to the consumer through Funko\u2019s website or (what I think is more likely) through retail partners like GameStop, Target, Walmart, Hot Topic, and other retailers looking to get in on the NFT craze.\n\nQuote from Funko\u2019s CEO [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1t-SZBwBkM) about NFT\u2019s:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited about it and we have a plan in place. We have some technology in place. We are going to be out in the market fairly soon. But we\u2019re going to out in the market in a very different way. We have the ability to disrupt this space in a way that nobody else is doing right now. We can tie digital NFT\u2019s to our fan base and link NFT\u2019s with physical products. And that\u2019s not happening right now. So, for example, if you had a pack of NFT\u2019s. I won\u2019t mention licenses. And there are a few rare ones. If you have those rare ones, we\u2019re going to give you a free product that is tied to that rare NFT. Which means you have a super rare physical product that ties to your super rare NFT. That\u2019s disruptive. That\u2019s new. It\u2019s different. It\u2019s only what Funko can do. And we\u2019re really excited about what the future of NFT\u2019s are. We\u2019re certainly all over this. And I think you\u2019ll see fairly soon from Funko in the market.\u201d\n\nTL;DR: \n\nAs expected, Funko had a strong Q4 2020, driven by continued strength in their core product line and e-commerce sales in the US market. Funko\u2019s sales are expected to continue to grow in 2021 as the company builds upon its wins from the second half of 2020. Funko\u2019s international business represents an area of additional opportunity as the company has not fully recovered from sales declines in the region yet. Continued development of Funko\u2019s direct-to-consumer initiatives in Europe along with store reopenings after lockdowns should remedy this. \n\nWhile Funko has not formally announced their entry into the NFT market with a press release, Funko\u2019s interview with Yahoo Finance suggests that Funko soon will. Funko announcing their entry into NFT\u2019s would probably drive more attention to the stock and more investors to Funko products. At that point Funko would become more than just a \u201ctoy company.\u201d They would become a collectibles company making products for the NFT marketplace. Many products made by Funko already command a significant premium in the secondary market. (Some examples: [Disney Bag 1](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Disney-Cast-Member-Exclusive-LE-600-Mickey-90th-Anniversary-Loungefly-Backpack/353336689947?hash=item524482051b:g:hj4AAOSwTu9fyDep), [Disney Bag 2](https://www.ebay.com/itm/NWT-Disney-Loungefly-Sleeping-Beauty-DEC-Employee-Backpack/373488324364?hash=item56f5a38f0c:g:eWIAAOSw3qVgRW30), [Funko 1](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Funko-Freddy-Bloody-leatherface-POP-Exclusive-12-PIECES-EXTREMELY-RARE/143968624938?hash=item218532e12a:g:RgIAAOSwEiNgQco-), [Funko 2](https://www.ebay.com/itm/FUNKO-Pop-Games-Fortnite-VALOR-463-Vinyl-Figure-NIB/392842180285?epid=15027456221&amp;hash=item5b7737f6bd:g:wRMAAOSwc7Ve6lE9), [Funko 3](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Funko-POP-Star-Wars-Holographic-Darth-Maul-SDCC-480pcs/133480926875?hash=item1f14154e9b:g:JjMAAOSwfYpfJMGL)). Imagine what could happen to prices if those same products were combined with accompanying NFTs. This new opportunity with NFT\u2019s provides optionality on an already stable core business of collectible toys, games, and merchandise.\n\nPositions: Long Shares &amp; Calls\n\nDisclosure: I am long FNKO.

        "selftext": " \n\n**(VIH) - Bakkt**  \nBakkt, the digital asset wallet backed by ICE, is being acquired by VPC Impact Acquisition Holdings (VIH). Bakkt unlocks the $1.2+ trillion of digital assets that are currently held in cryptocurrencies, rewards and loyalty points, gaming assets, and merchant stored value.   \nBakkt began in 2018 with the vision to bring trust and transparency to digital assets. Through the Bakkt Warehouse and Bakkt Bitcoin Futures and Options contracts, they serve institutional clients in an end-to-end regulated market with true price transparency.   \nFor consumers, Bakkt aggregates various digital assets to enable instant liquidity and to empower users to trade, transfer and pay however they want. Merchants within the Bakkt ecosystem see a lower cost of payment acceptance, enhanced customer engagement, and decreased loyalty liability through a variety of redemption options.\n\n**Who is behind VIH and the Bakkt acquisition?**  \nVictory Park Capital is the sponsor behind VPC Impact Acquisition. Victory Park Capital was founded in 2007 and is a privately held SEC-registered global alternative investment firm. Since its inception, they have invested $6.0+ billion in over 115 transactions globally.   \n**Transaction Overview**  \nThe post-merger pro forma valuation implies a $2.1 billion enterprise value. 100% of equity will be rolled over from private investors and form 78% of the new entity with 12% going to PIPE investors, 8% to public SPAC investors, and 2% of equity going to the SPAC sponsor.  \nThe combination of SPAC trust account proceeds (assuming no redemptions) and the PIPE investment is expected to provide Bakkt with $574M of pro forma cash to accelerate the growth of the business. Most notably, of its consumer product application, and for general working capital purposes. No additional equity capital requirements are anticipated between closing and achieving positive cash flow, which is expected in 2023.   \n**Who/What is ICE?**   \nI.C.E is short for the Intercontinental Exchange, which has a significant stake in Bakkt. The company was actually started by Jeffrey Sprecher, the founder, and chairman of I.C.E and chairman of the New York Stock Exchange. Kelly Loeffler, the controversial U.S Senator from Georgia, who recently lost her seat, and spouse to Jeffrey Sprecher, was briefly the C.E.O of Bakkt during its launch.   \nI believe these connections and backing are important to be aware of and keep in mind. It is within their best interests for Bakkt to succeed, and their direct experience running the world's largest legacy exchanges for equities means they have a vast wealth of knowledge in the right areas.   \n\n\n* ICE has a market cap of $65 billion  \n\n* Global market infrastructure provider with a history of developing and implementing leading technologies  \n\n* Operates exchanges, clearinghouses, and listing venues for the financial markets alongside offering data-driven technology services to support the trading, lending, investment, risk management, and connectivity needs of customers   \n\n* By combining world-class technology with leading data services and operating expertise, ICE adds transparency which enables customer efficiency gains that advance its networks and value proposition  \n\n\n**Bakkt Already Has Institutional Investors**  \nBakkt is currently 81% owned by ICE but also maintains stakeholders including Boston Consulting Group, Microsoft\u2019s M12, Starbucks, and PayU. ICE and minority investors have contributed more than $880 million of capital and assets to date, leveraging ICE\u2019s leading competency of creating and operating market infrastructure.   \n\n\n**Investment Highlights**  \nBakkt aims to tap into massive market opportunities with digital assets by empowering monetization and adoption. Bakkt has a transformative consumer marketplace backed by internet economics. Their integrated platform connects payments with markets and commerce enablement. Diversified revenue streams and a direct path to positive cash flow with no additional capital required for funding leads to a superior economic model with scale, growth, and profitability.   \n\n\n**Bakkt has competitive edges in a disruptive ecosystem**  \nBakkt is positioning itself as a mixup between Robinhood, CashApp, Venmo, Coinbase, Stripe, and Kraken. They are competitively advantaged against peers with the aim of creating a sustainable moat into the future.   \nKey Differentiators \n\n* Regulated platforms across trading, clearing, custody, and payments build confidence and instill trust across the ecosystem  \n\n* Powerful partnerships and integrations with loyalty sponsors, global financial institutions and leading retail brands  \n\n* Continued backing by ICE provides market credibility and industry experience  \n\n* Structural exchange and payment processing cost advantages lead to a defensible pricing moat against competitors; Bakkt users can trade Bitcoin at a 50% discount cost reduction compared to Coinbase users  \n\n* Digital asset native, unlike competitors PayPal or Square  \n\n\n**Regulated, Secure, and Trusted Crypto Custody**  \nBecause of Bakkts connection with ICE, they are able to leverage their robust platform of security protocols, which makes Bakkt the preferred marketplace for a growing number of institutional Bitcoin investors. ICE utilizes a sophisticated cybersecurity program.   \nTheir infrastructure is disaster-resilient, in that they use ICEs dedicated fiber network across the globe. With secondary facilities capable of supporting all production workloads. Additionally, they are regularly conducting penetration tests and security audits. One of the real value-drivers for Bakkt is going to be their connections with ICE and being able to utilize their framework for regulatory hurdles moving forward.   \n**Creating Value with Partnerships**  \nBakkt has 200+ gift card merchants already integrated into the app including Home Depot, Xbox, Starbucks, and Subway. Partially integrated partners range from PNC and Citibank to Allegient, and Best Buy. \n\nBakkt is also in advanced discussions with Apple, 3 of the top 5 US Financial institutions, 2 of the top 6 US airlines, 5 of the largest Hotel Loyalty Partners, 3 of 5 largest QSR\u2019s, 5 large merchants in everyday consumer spend.   \nAdditionally, Bakkt has received confirmed strategic interest from the remaining 4 major US airlines, and 3 of the largest Hotel Loyalty Partners.   \n**Multiple Sources of Revenue**  \nBakkt has a diverse revenue generation model that can monetize transactions through multiple revenue streams including payments, trading, conversion, and P2P.   \n\n\n**Financial Profile Projections FY2025**\n\n* 30+ Million Active Users  \n\n* 36% Active User Growth CAGR  \n\n* Customer Acquisition Cost - $7  \n\n* Total Revenue per Active User - $210  \n\n* Adjusted EBTIDA Margin of 55%  \n\n\n**Financial Summary** \n\n* Total revenue expected to grow from 889 in FY21 to $3.03B in FY22, $4.6B in FY23, $5.7B in FY24, and $6.5B by FY25. Representing 241%, 55%, 23%, and 15% growth respectively  \n\n\n**Conclusion**  \nBakkt is a fantastic and overlooked opportunity in the SPAC market. SaaS and brokerage apps have great margins and unprecedented growth rates over the next decade. Bakkt is targeting some of the largest and most liquid markets over the coming years. With their backing by ICE, it\u2019s hard to imagine this company failing despite it\u2019s slow development time.   \nCurrently, we have seen how hot the market is for anything related to Bitcoin, namely Coinbase, but we can also see it if we look at RIOT, MARA, CAN, and other companies whose stock ticks move in correlation to crypto, but the underlying business are, for the most part, junk businesses whose stocks are being run up by sentiment. Whereas Bakkt has institutional investors, massive partnerships, and cost advantages to current competitors.   \nI personally took the time to download the app and dig around. Currently, it\u2019s not the best, it\u2019s actually sort of junk relative to more established players. However, that doesn\u2019t deter me, as long as the team executes their plans, the app has the potential to be the #1 cryptocurrency trading app for U.S users. I say that because Coinbase is bad in terms of its costs and it only has so much business from users due to the brand having so much mindshare relative to peers, and it\u2019s the only on-ramp for U.S users.   \nThere is also Binance U.S, which is, unfortunately, a huge piece of junk with not enough volume or liquidity to match the original Binance app. However, U.S users are restricted to the bad Binance app because of lacking regulation and poor insight from U.S politicians. Because of this, Bakkt has a wide-open opportunity if it can execute on developing an intuitive and responsive interface while undercutting competitor costs and providing more liquidity.",

        "selftext": "# Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this post is to write out the thought process and analysis of some of my major investments. Each of these investments can take over a year to decide on, but cannot be invested in until I have written out the process.\n\nPart of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation to open-source complex information.\n\n\\- Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even RH?\n\n\\- Does the average retail investor understand incentives vs. bias?\n\n\\- Is the average retail investor familiar with fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?\n\n\\- Is an average retail investor familiar with competitive types of manufacturing processes when they invest in technologies like AMD or GE?\n\n\\- Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio?\n\nAt the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m sharing my writing. I\u2019m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.\n\n# The Fundamental Constraint\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s9uystsmn0n61.png?width=1613&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=612d845bce1686629bd7aa7d2bedef5028891ba9\n\nThis one is not going to be easy to understand, so get your coffee ready and get comfortable. It\u2019s going to be difficult to digest the technology behind Square because it asks you to believe the premise that banking is going to change in unforeseeable ways in the near future. I currently work in the Banking-as-a-Service sector as an engineer, so I have some insight that I could offer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA fair amount of people may not know this, but organizations like Stripe, Square, PayPal, and other fintech infrastructures are just network layers over existing banks. For example, Stripe partners with Evolve Bank while Square partners with Sutton Bank. This is a win-win scenario, for now, where banks get to see the benefits of technology distribution powers, while tech companies gain a shortcut to regulatory requirements.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt may help to accept this by understanding the idea that drives the financial technology sector. In order to distribute financial services to people, regardless of net worth, **trustworthiness and accountability must be established**. These are regulatory frameworks developed by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), Anti Money Laundering (AML) or Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) that are also challenged by such technologies like B\\*tcoin, where validation is arbitrary and based on advanced fingerprinted privacy. This trustworthiness is also the reason why you\u2019re able to instantly invest in your RH account - you are a trusted user and there is no reason to believe that you are somebody else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pms84rvhpvm61.png?width=2073&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11914ae63ebcb5a662e9c623e7caf558382539e5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust take Charlie Munger's advice to inverse. If these new currencies are bad because they cannot detect crime, then it means that you belong to a system that assumes you are untrustworthy first. These relationships are constantly monitored in things like credit score, loans, and other means of securing wealth.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3wqso7bkovm61.png?width=1457&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88e922d828b2fb5655e4ce433e6bfcf05f5ff891\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is, then, no secret as to why Square invested in B\\*tcoin. There are other reasons, even cultural, as to why they did, but the basic root behind the decision is that it allows research into new verification methods that makes shipping financial services even more frictionless. It is a potential vector for changing the rules of the game and leveling the playing field, so to speak. Being a software-first bank allows you to distribute at a much more rapid pace than a traditional large bank. To be totally frank, the American banking industry has quite a brutal history. Enter Jay-Z.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5fl6iy73p0n61.png?width=1504&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ab621637733790abcc73468f29aa300950f6d2c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/juszlp60rvm61.png?width=1006&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8537287a2d45d8869023d66f80d67e506c7070e6\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn short, The fuel of fintech is the underbanked. The combustion engine that burns it is cybersecurity and AI to validate that a user is trustworthy each time they commit a transaction. This is known as the KYC Problem and how each organization approaches the regulatory requirement to verify that a user is not committing fraud will determine the outcome of who dominates the fintech sector. This is also why you see customer-service as a pervasive problem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p7cgc88hl0n61.png?width=1772&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0234ebda1584799431ac5ee4936c580cd5e99d2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Underbanked\n\nJack Dorsey is an interesting character, who views on technology can be highlighted\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b83hyt7yl0n61.png?width=1494&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf497fa79d6162b868fac37c54aed27f13efbdf8\n\nInterestingly enough, Twitter is used in such a manner. The Tweet system these days gets shared across all social media platforms due to its simple design and even appears interactively during sporting events or billboards.\n\nIn my view, Jack Dorsey sees the current period of time as a turning point in internet communications and the underbanked. It is clear as day in its marketing strategy, where Square seller services is marketed strongly toward immigrants and minority America. while Cash App is strongly marketed toward young, first-time banking customers. No really, go ahead and look at two things:\n\n\\- Cash App\u2019s Twitter and advertising strategy\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1qvo71pmm0n61.png?width=1487&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bca7632db9415950320744b438310aba1518a105\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cjm7d1fpm0n61.png?width=1482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8604ba6d3b892c789c2a3d8a615ed2dd38b31cb4\n\n\\- The geographic results on Google Trends when searching \u201cCash App vs. Venmo\u201d. Southern USA generally sees less banking due to increased poverty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nl52ye7ym0n61.png?width=2949&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=632d7f0b5043f169520fdb1af54bc3c8a3080322\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Chicago's North vs. South Sides](https://preview.redd.it/r3l5dtm7n0n61.png?width=1402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2d7b39081a3229ef0d163dc5bba00a2d861eeb7)\n\nIt is clear as day and the reason is due to the nature of the demographics of underbanked users. You see, access to banking is not much different than access to the internet or access to clean water.  That is, the closer you are to poverty, the closer you are to lacking access to basic resources. What is interesting about Square\u2019s youth and culture strategy is that it builds a life-long trust with the org. You\u2019ve heard it before, \u201cwhy doesn\u2019t school teach us important thing like taxes or investing?\u201d. Square is attacking that pulse in its design. It offers:\n\n1. The ability to start a business\n2. The ability to invest and educate in basic stocks\n3. The ability to invest and educate in B\\*tcoin\n4. The ability to save on basic purchases\n5. The ability to file taxes (not yet, but the company acquired the means to)\n\nWhat this inevitably means is that we probably won\u2019t even see Square operating at \u201cfull-force\u201d until at least 2030 and beyond, as these early aged customers grow with Square and embed more of their financials.\n\n# Speculation\n\nThis is what I expect after examining regulatory environments, product quality, and competitive outlooks:\n\n1. Square will either acquire Sutton Bank or reduce its dependency on Sutton Bank\u2019s regulatory offerings.\n2. Square will become a bank to avoid direct competition with Big Tech, while competing aggressively against Big Banking by offering the ability to ship financial services.\n3. The way they will achieve this is by developing a stronger form of cybersecurity and AI that will allow a smoother verification process.\n4. Square will develop an internet railway, where exchanging currency will be accessible in different mediums like video-games or streams that may compete with orgs like Visa or MasterCard.\n5. Square will compete with Banking-as-a-service and checkout offerings like Stripe, Plaid, and Shopify.\n6. Square will foray into equal housing.\n7. Square will improved loan systems.\n8. Square will enter taboo markets like cannabis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease follow for more content.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/reviews/06hGKT6YUeRY99vz4MVPPh0-7..1569477220.jpg](https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/reviews/06hGKT6YUeRY99vz4MVPPh0-7..1569477220.jpg)",

        "selftext": "Im in the process of building my future long term investing portfolio. Im planning slightly riskier for 5 years with 19% stocks and 81% ETFs. This is my breakdown i will rebalance and decrease my stocks to 10-15% and decrease % of QQQJ/QQQM after 5 years. \n\nVTI- 30%\n\nVXUS- 10%\n\nQQQJ/QQQM- 20%\n\nVTV- 6% \n\nARK's- 12%\n\nSMH- 2% \n\nStocks (apple, disney, Draftkings, paypal, square)- 19%\n\nSo my question is obviously i know im tech heavy with qqqj, qqqm, arks and my stocks. Its why i threw VTV in there since value is pretty big right now. For the most part comparing qqq to VTV qqq way outperfroms it but VTV has a nice consistent growth. But with VTV... VTI holds 99% of their holdings. So wouldnt it make sense just to elimate VTV and add more VTI? \n\nAlso i included VXUS for international stock exposure... is 10% a good amount? Or should i add less? Or more? \n\nLong term my goals 15-20 years to use this invested money to buy both kids a car at 16 and pay for as mucn college as i can... but i wanna do a little more risky for 5 years and less risky after that. \n\nThoughts? \nHow does my breakdown look?",

        "selftext": "## Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this post is to write out the thought process and analysis of some of my major investments. Each of these investments can take over a year to decide on, but cannot be invested in until I have written out the process.\n\nPart of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation to open-source complex information.\n\n- Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even RH? \n\n- Does the average retail investor understand incentives vs. bias?\n\n- Is the average retail investor familiar with fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?\n\n- Is an average retail investor familiar with competitive types of manufacturing processes when they invest in technologies like AMD or GE? \n\n- Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio?\n\nAt the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m sharing my writing. I\u2019m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.\n\n\n## Investing in Internet Forums\n\nIn my view, Pinterest can be one of the most sound social-networking investments.  Let\u2019s keep one question in mind:\n\n&gt; Did Facebook\u2019s implementation of a hashtag kill Twitter?\n\nUltimately, what drives a social-networking site is a user\u2019s incentive to search and discover information in that particular forum. As a result, examining social-networking sites can be a lot like comparing shopping centers, such that a shopper is incentivized to go to a location for a particular reason that is served by that institution.\n\nThe forum may take on a different medium, but it is ultimately a forum none the less. If we try to categorize it roughly, the forums would look like this:\n\n- Google is fueled by user\u2019s need for answered information.\n- Facebook is fueled by a user\u2019s need to connect.\n- Pinterest is fueled by a user\u2019s need for ideas.\n- Reddit is fueled by a user\u2019s need for community.\n- Online video games are fueled by a user\u2019s need for adventure.\n\nWith this basic model, you can argue which forum may be inelastic. In my view, it ranks like this, where the top rank is the most inelastic due to human behavior:\n\n1. Google (need for information)\n2. Games (need for adventure)\n3. Reddit (need for community)\n4. Pinterest (need for ideas)\n5. Facebook (need to connect)\n\nThe reason I rank Facebook as the most elastic version is because I have already witnessed multiple transformations resulting in users connecting in various ways. I eventually expect this to replicate in other nations too because doing everything is simply just weird and scares users off. I also believe that people really underestimate how quickly humans find new ways to connect and can move to another platform for connection; which is quite a common occurrence in online gaming.\n\n\n## Searching \n\nThat being said, I think Pinterest is wonderfully positioned and has quite an interesting history. The network-effect that built Pinterest was mostly driven by women, which has profound economic consequences. As a result, Pinterest\u2019s recommendation model is geared to advertise to women-influenced interests and has already adopted the technology to be used a certain way: a search engine for ideas which is now beginning to permeate in households internationally. \n\nThis has long-term positive consequences for product messengers that can be the subject of such idea searches regardless of your culture. You can try it yourself to understand; it feels like what you want Google Images to do for you at times: \n\nBirthday gift ideas (Michaels, Corsair)\nSkincare ideas (Target)\nTips for traveling to another area (AirBnB)\nHome construction (Sherwin-Williams, James hardie, etc)\n\nThe fact is, it\u2019s the user who is actually voluntarily searching for ads in an ad space. \nBehaviorally, this means that Pinterest\u2019s users are in a \u201chigh willingness to engage\u201d with things that result in \u201caction\u201d. That is, a Pinterest user is logging in because they need to start something or they need to plan for something in the near future. This is basically a sweet spot for advertisers, as they know they\u2019re getting top real estate on BOTH Google and Pinterest as a result of their product design. \n\nPinterest was not designed to make a user spend hours mindlessly scrolling for content. It was designed to make a sale and keep a customer happy _outside_ of Pinterest. That is fundamentally different than Facebook\u2019s connect-everything approach to social-networking.\n\n\n## The Design\n\nPinterest ranks high in Google\u2019s results for specific reasons. Pinterest develops its own in-app browser that has particular consequences for:\n\n1. Security &amp; Privacy\n2. High demand for high quality ad-messaging and visuals\n3. Vectors to user\u2019s websites generated by hosts like Shopify or Wordpress.\n4. Vectors for advertisers\n5. Vectors for user\u2019s channels like Etsy, Zoom, or TikTok.\n6. A browser that follows Progressive Web App standards\n\nThe combination of these design choices ranks it high in \u201cGoogle\u2019s algorithm\u201d, while this search engine result increases its bar for ranking each year. This means that bigger organizations like Twitter, Doordash, and Pinterest will enjoy the tailwinds of these priorities.\n\nWhy is Google doing this? Because they want high web standards as a global competitor. Part of the global competition is shaping the internet\u2019s develop to consider people that have high latency connections since software can scale faster than some of the hardware that is available around the globe. The internet is ultimately \u201caccess to information\u201d, which is as scarce as \u201caccess to clean water\u201d around the globe. So it\u2019s carefully considered in strong engineering communities.\n\n\n\n## Summary\n\nI believe Pinterest qualifies as an excellent investment. I totally love the fact that the network-effect behind Pinterest is built by women, but not necessarily for women. I am carefully monitoring the results of this network-effect as I believe that it will have long-term consequences on family life. I feel that this kind of product design will eventually create a deeper gravity for advertisers, where they know that Pinterest users are essentially  sustainable top dollar advertising spaces - as users are looking directly to consume as a result of their usage which is far different than other social-media platform strategies.\n\n\nI use Facebook and Instagram every day, resulting in nothing. I use Pinterest a few times a month at most. The difference is, every time I use Pinterest - I follow up or plan to follow up with some consumer behavior. That, to me, is incredible.\n\n\n\n\n\nPls follow for more essays.\n\n\nhttps://static.jeffbullas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Pinterest-vs-Facebook-Social-Commerce-Infographic.jpg",

        "selftext": "I don\u2019t know if anyone will see this but I had to get this off my chest because it was bothering me. I\u2019m sure Bruce is a nice guy but I am disturbed by his coverage of AMC and him putting down AMC shareholders by calling them amateur traders and pitting AMC against GME.\n\nAs a preface, **I want both AMC and GME to do well** whether one squeezes before the other or they both squeeze at the same time. However, I completely disagree with Bruce\u2019s \u201cfundamental-based\u201d analysis of AMC and think it is utterly misinformed, disingenuous, and reckless.\n\n**A Few Things I find Sketch about Bruce (This is merely my opinion and I don\u2019t mean to offend anyone)**\n\n1.  He asks for donations on PayPal. He does this so that he does not have to pay taxes on that \u201cincome.\u201d Since it is labeled as a donation, which he wants, he doesn\u2019t declare that money but rather pockets the full amount. Other YouTubers do not do this unless I am missing something.\n\n2.  (please let me know if I am wrong about this point) He claims to have no money in stocks, but I find this extremely hard to believe for a few reasons. First off, he said he used to be a stockbroker and people trust his advice because they believe he is a knowledgeable investor. If he is a good investor, he has to have some money in an appreciating asset class, whether that is real estate, commodities or some other alternative asset. I find it hard to believe he is storing all of his money in cash/savings, especially with ongoing fears of inflation. Being involved with the capital markets for many years now, I would expect that he has investments in the stock market. All I am saying is he never shows his screens, and we will never know the truth. I actually appreciate that the other Youtubers show their portfolio and even though there are biases, it is obvious, and they are upfront.\n\n3.  Finally, call me a skeptic, but Bruce is a salesman by trade. That is what a stockbroker is. Just think about the Wolf of Wall Street and think does this man have your best interest at heart. Maybe he does but the entire PayPal donation and charging 400 dollars for a session sounds fishy to me. No offense, but there are very few people I would pay 400 dollars to talk to and Bruce certainly is not one of them.\n\n**WHY HE IS SO WRONG ABOUT AMC FUNDAMENTALS (I respect those who believe in GME\u2019s bull thesis but please do not put down AMC and its shareholders).**\n\n1.  I don\u2019t care what anyone says but Bruce has not done full DD on AMC and it shows. I don\u2019t know if he believes he will make more money if he simply panders to one audience (GME) or if he genuinely believes what he says.\n\n2.  From an asymmetrical risk to reward ratio, AMC makes more sense for me at this current valuation, whereas I find it much harder to justify GME\u2019s valuation. I know people are in it for the squeeze/momentum, but Bruce likes to talk fundamentals.\n\n3.  People like Bruce love to mention AMC\u2019s debt, and I think it is important, but they fail to realize that it was strategic debt. AMC was investing heavily for the future. They by far have the best and most innovative movie theater experiences in the world with the dine-in setup where waiters take your order at your seat and bring the food to your seat, the incredible recliner seats, Dolby Cinema, etc. Additionally, they were acquiring theater chains in Europe and expanding into the Middle East. This strategic debt has allowed them to separate themselves from the competition and they were not expecting the pandemic to hit and cause such a strain.\n\n4.  AMC is a business with a moat around it. They have 80 percent market share in the US, whereas Cinemark only has around 20 percent, yet analysts say invest in Cinemark because they do not have debt. This is stupidity. People that think AMC is going down simply believe movie theaters will go extinct, which again the numbers show that this is extremely misguided. From 2017 to 2019 pre-pandemic, AMC was having its best years. The box office was in its golden age. AMC was bringing in over 5 billion dollars with growth year over year. People will say it was because of Avengers, but filmmaking is continuing to grow with technological advancements and certain films must be watched in theaters for the full experience. Across the board, we were seeing groundbreaking numbers whether it was horror (Get Out, Us, A Quiet Place, It), films like Crazy Rich Asians, A Star is Born, all of the Kevin Hart and Rock films, all the Disney movies, DC movies, and so much more.\n\n5.  I believe GME has a much tougher road ahead of them. I hope they succeed but they are relying on a pivot into a whole new business model, which is e-commerce where they will face off against giants like Amazon, Target, Walmart, Costco, etc. I also understand that they are trying to become the social and cultural hub for gaming, but there is no guarantee for that as gamers like to be in the comforts of their homes and can interact through mics and chat.\n\n6.  GME folks believe in Ryan Cohen, and we have just as much right to believe in Adam Aron, who is the trailblazer in this industry. He was the CEO of Royal Caribbean and of the 76ers. Also, he has been making deals with production companies/streaming services that everyone fails to mention. He made a first-of-its-kind deal with Universal where AMC will get a portion of their digital rental income. AMC did this by refusing to showcase Universal movies after they said they would simultaneously release films in theaters and on digital rental services. AMC has power as well; remember, the box office is the quickest way for production companies to make hundreds of millions and billions rather than relying on subscriber growth, and AMC charges for screens and takes a chunk of that box office.\n\n7.  Finally, this thought that AMC is going to issue shares and screw us is blatantly false. Adam Aron is on our side and wants us to be successful and also knows if he issues shares, he will lose more money in the long run because he will lose all of this newfound support for AMC just to raise quick money by issuing shares and diluting existing shareholders. Furthermore, the retail investors have a huge say in this now, as we get to vote on any possible share issuance. I actually firmly believe Aron is doing this to screw the shorts as a share recount must be conducted to expose any synthetic and falsified shares. Also, Aron keeps saying they have plenty of cash in the bank and the upcoming movie slate is extremely strong, and also, we have that vote all the way in May, which is not even to issue shares but rather to simply expand the number of shares in the future if they want to issue shares. Bruce should know that there is a long process in order to issue shares. Companies need shareholder approval, as well as a prospectus, receiving an application of shares, allotment of shares, and a call on shares.  You cannot simply come out the next day and do so. AMC was lucky in February as they had the filings already prepared previously, but this supposed share issuance is not worrying any of us AMC shareholders. We can say the same thing about GME but we are not.\n\n**SQUEEZE POTENTIAL FOR BOTH AMC AND GME**\n\n1.  I believe that both are prime squeeze candidates but don\u2019t take it from me. Ihor Dusaniwsky, who is the managing director at S3 Partners, one of the premier data reporting services with regards to short data gives both AMC and GME a score of 10 on his squeeze score metric. Keep in mind he has been doing this for decades now.\n\n2.  Also, with regards to a gamma squeeze, when you look at the volume for the options on barchart, AMC actually has the most volume out of any stock only behind Apple (which is always #1). GME is nowhere to be found at the top of that list, but this can quickly change.\n\nAgain, I never do this kind of thing, but I felt it was necessary. There is so much more I could say but that is already a lot. No disrespect to Bruce but I hope he sees this and reconsiders his outlook on AMC or just the whole movement in general rather than pitting AMC and GME against one another. Hopefully, Trey and him or another YouTuber can talk it out.",

        "selftext": "Nike is our all American favorite sports brand but are they a good investment? Well, I\u2019m just not sure anymore. \n\nPros:\n\n* They continue to be profitable \n* Earnings are forecast to grow 17.8% per year for the next 3 years\n* Share price is relatively stable\n* Revenue 38B\n\nCons:\n\n* High debt acquired in 2020\n* Profit margin (7.4%) is lower than last year (11.2%)\n* New CEO compensation is bonkers\n* Stock is overpriced possibly by 50%\n\nFair valuation calculations:\n\nAccording to 2 stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Valuation Model Nike is overvalued by a whopping $70 per share putting the fair value at $70.15.\n\nPE vs Industry:\n\nNKE is a poor value based on PE Ratio (77.6x) compared to US Luxury Industry average (26.2x)\n\nPEG ratio: \n\nNKE is poor value based on a PEG of (4.4x)\n\nPB vs Industry:\n\nNKE is overvalued on its PB Ratio (20.8x) compared to US Luxury industry average (1.9x)\n\nFuture Growth:\n\n17.8% which sounds decent until you compare it to the industry which is expected to grow 25.2%. Revenue growth is also projected at 9.4% while industry is at 10%. \n\nPast Performance:\n\nHistorical annual earnings growth is -3.3% over the last 5 years. Nike\u2019s earnings have declined 3.3% per year over the last 5 years. Nike has had negative earnings growth over the past year, so it can\u2019t be compared to it\u2019s 5 year average. Nike had negative earnings growth (-38.2%) over the past year, making it difficult to compare to the Luxury industry average (-42%).\n\nDEBT:\n\nNKE debt is considered HIGH. Debt to Equity ratio is at a whopping (88.8%). This debt went from 15.7% in 2019 to 88.8% in 2020. This is mostly brand new debt. \n\nCEO Compensation:\n\nNike has a new CEO John Donahoe. His compensation is insane. His take home for 2020 was 54M. This is one of the highest in the world for CEO compensation. Just to give you a comparison - Tim Cook of Apple took home 12M in 2020. I also find it interesting that Donahoe ushered in this unprecedented level of company debt in the same year. \n\nDonahoe comes from Paypal and we all know how Paypal treats its customers. I expect to see Nike\u2019s customer service and quality of products go downhill from here. \n\nA lot of people are bullish on NIKE but I just don\u2019t see it.",

My Mom is a Financial Advisor of 25+ years and has raised me to invest, buy and hold, diversify, etc. She doesn\u2019t buy individual stocks and only invests in Mutual Funds and ETF\u2019s mostly because my Mom and Dad\u2019s age (65/60) and risk level. I always had her put me in Science and Technology and it\u2019s done very well to say the least. I am generally knowledgeable of the market and understand the risks involved.\n\nI am now 26 and working from home. I work in Sales for a TV sports network and make $80,000/yr.

I am obviously much riskier than my Mom and currently have $54,000 in shares of extremely high risk,  volatile stocks (TTD, AMZN, AAPL, MSFT, ABNB, FSLY, PINS, FB, PYPL, SE, SHOP, SQ, MELI, DDOG, ARKK) and around 25 more tech, e-commerce, and infrastructure stocks. The problem is I had saved $30,000 the past year and bought a lot of tech last Monday. Needless to say it got bumpy and my Mom offered me a deal when my account got to $48,000 (16% in 2 days):\n\nNow for the investment advice:\n\nDEAL: Guaranteed my $61,000 original investment if I do not invest any more money this year and simply hold investments of some kind until the end of the year. IF they are above $61,000 at the end of the year, we will split any profits 50/50. \n\nI am looking to buy a house the beginning of 2022 so this is a 6-9 month window.

        "selftext": "Can someone explain to me why REGN continues to go down or in general their market cap seems uncorrelated with their revenues/profits?\n\nTheir revenues have grown 16% on average over the last 5 years and have monotonically grown over the last 10 years (I.e. their revenues grow every year). Their EBT is 27-40% which on either end of the interval is quite good. They only trade at 15 P/E where plenty of drug manufactures like JNJ trade at 30.  They have not been diluting shares, their forward looking projections are optimistic, and they are well below analyst price projections (although I don't care too much for that).\n\nThey have 9 approved drugs and 8 in phase 3. I assume most won't make it from phase III to being FDA Approved but they appear as through they will be able to get something.  Are all bio stocks just hype machines?  \n\n\nOverall, I am miffed by the evaluation here but I think it's because I don't know much about pharmaceuticals.  \n\n\n \n\n\\*Disclaimer   \nI do **not** own REGN.   \nMy holdings are: V, MA, BA, TSM, CRM, SYK, TRVN, ETN, C, HHC, PYPL, TWLO  \nthe two medical related are: SYK &amp; TRVN",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone, \n\nI'm new to trading and got into options last March around the start of the pandemic. I like Paypal as a company and played some naked calls over the last few months. I learned about the debit call spread last month and bought two vertical spreads.\n\nI'm bullish on PYPL and bought some when it dropped to its 100 moving average of $230. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o2xsgxhigcn61.png?width=1465&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9998a5e4cc37953f56e7838f55f1a20c6b89e549\n\nThis partnership with Flutterwave might be the kick my spreads needed.\n\n[Link to article](https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/flutterwave-and-paypal-partner-to-allow-african-merchants-to-accept-and-make-payments/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29)\n\nTo quote from the article,\n\n&gt;It is nearly impossible for businesses in some African countries to receive money from PayPal. While the payments giant has not given reasons why this is so, speculation hints at factors like insufficient regulation and poor banking security in said countries.\u00a0  \nThat might be a thing of the past for some businesses as African payments company [Flutterwave](https://flutterwave.com/) today is announcing a partnership with PayPal to allow PayPal customers globally to pay African merchants through its platform.  \nVia this partnership, businesses can connect with the more than [377 million PayPal accounts globally](https://www.statista.com/statistics/218493/paypals-total-active-registered-accounts-from-2010/) and overcome the challenges presented by the highly fragmented and complex payment and banking infrastructure on the continent.\n\n**Positions**\n\nI bought a vertical spread expiring March 23rd and when Paypal dropped more last week I bought another spread expiring March 19th.\n\n252.5/270 C March 19\n\n250/262.5 C March 23\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SQ vs Paypal?**\n\nWith Cathie Woods supporting Square, I'm leaning more towards SQ than Paypal lately. Someone bought $1,608,540 \\~1.6 million dollars worth of March 26 Calls at $270 strike price so either they know something we don't or they have too much money lying around. What do you guys think is a better play in short term (3-5 weeks), SQ or PYPL?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q0phjxfsfcn61.png?width=702&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=587b0d6f289e2674d80e0f18f56bd8364529cc7e",

        "selftext": "360 Digitech (QFIN) Due Diligence: How You Can Take Advantage of Developing Markets\n\nDeveloping markets are a place where real estate is as lucrative and potent as technology is in the developed markets. This is primarily due to the rising population rates beating out the EPS growth of the NASDAQ, and the increasing living standards in formerly socialist nations that has caused an exodus from a feudal or rent based systems towards overwhelming private *ownership*. This means that there\u2019s a growing demand for a variety of credit lines, from business loans to home mortgages. Enter 360 DigiTech, a fintech firm that helps financial institutions through its platform which enables them to provide better and targeted products and services to a broader consumer base. 360 Digitech has products targeted for banks, insurance, and private wealth management as well and their SaaS assists in customer acquisition, funding optimization, risk assessment, and post-lending management. 360 Digitech has a vast swath of customers and addressable markets, as you can see here: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iskh8wkqffn61.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15b3c227c36851b3a12697cc02d798774d802fc6\n\nAs you can see, 360 Digitech plans on bridging the gap between banks, insurance, mortgage lenders, and others to small businesses and average consumers. Leverage can be a very important strategic tool for overall economic growth, and the centrally-planned economy of China is still strongly [encouraging the use of debt](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/16/china-is-open-to-more-debt-to-support-its-economy.html). \u201cTotal social financing, a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, rose by nearly 3.5 trillion yuan ($522 billion) in September to a total of 280.07 trillion yuan. That was a 13.5% increase from a year ago \u2014 faster than the 12.8% pace recorded at the end of the second quarter, and 2.8 percentage points above the same period last year\u201d.\n\nChina\u2019s economic outlook is already far more positive than the U.S. 's as COVID-19 cases have been virtually nonexistent for several months. According to Nomura: \u201cThe rise in bond yields in the past few months reflects high funding demand instead of a People\u2019s Bank of China tightening, and infrastructure spending will likely push up headline GDP growth further.\u201d \n\nYou can also see that China\u2019s credit market has some great growth forecasted in its cards: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bkp77k9sffn61.png?width=292&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a12ceab6247a5d43a648183d92c3f26d2fcc519\n\nIncreased lending means a greater requirement for lending services, especially in the e-commercialized sector of China\u2019s economy. Despite QFIN being a relatively small company, it\u2019s not some unestablished startup. QFIN has partnered with KCB bank and Jack Ma\u2019s ANT Group to get the best of both traditional financing and online microfinancing, both of which are set to grow far more than the American counterparts of say, JP Morgan and Square.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q3nipl9tffn61.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac6bfbeeafc18833f9e88919d11a29c7fe5017bd\n\n360 Digitech provides consumer products in various segments as shown above, from debt for credit cards, to microfinancing loans for farmers. I bring the last example up because another Chinese company, PinDuoDuo has succeeded very well by penetrating into the Chinese agriculture market. 360 Digitech also provides financing for consumer products, another place where companies such as PayPal have seen great success. But where does QFIN set itself apart? As is the case with all successful companies in the 21st century, it\u2019s their competitive technology, in this case used for risk management: which \u201cMatches borrowers and financial institutions through big data and cloud computing technology\u201d. This AI creates a near perfect match rate of 98% as of their last report. This software aims to \u201cprovide a pre-loan investigation report of borrowers, which enables financial institutions to control risk\u201d. Of course, most details about this technology aren\u2019t revealed to us as it\u2019s their major trade secret, but we can definitely see the results of their technology hard at work. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1qg8xneuffn61.png?width=580&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43340852a90e4aaaa0fea18c21b1b1d4b6ae538a\n\nQFIN\u2019s cumulative borrowers were more than doubling until COVID hit in China, and despite that they still saw a healthy 19% growth in users. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 5k32u8gvffn61...*\n\nAdding to this, the new user\u2019s loan needs are virtually unchanged or even more concentrated now, because despite a 19% increase YoY for users, they saw 100% YoY increase in loan origination. This means QFIN was able to increase new loans and maintain loan retention on existing users or their newer users were far more intensive in use (basically, despite users increasing fourfold from 2017-18, loans only increased by a factor of three, while last year we saw a 1.2x increase in users, but a doubling in loans). So if this trend continues, QFINs variable costs will go down as customer acquisition won\u2019t be as necessary for sales growth. And as you can see, sales expenses are expected to be far lower than last year, which signifies better efficiency on their part. This will be extremely important for a company :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f5rjavnwffn61.png?width=659&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe544989f2d667d51b45d376a40050fb3e66d4cf\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1p2u4aoxffn61.png?width=390&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27fd75ec9f642242fc7b7c300115570f69815b0f\n\nAnd as we can see above, the profitability of the loans and returning customers are indeed there. This retention is key to growing the base of a young company like 360 Digitech.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0wuezzmyffn61.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88b6928fcf17396623f589ba24bac6d84e18443f\n\nOn top of this, you can see that the new loans being picked up by 360 Group are not defaulting, so despite higher volume they are not compromising on quality. Why is that? Because these loan acceptances go through Artificial Intelligence. Applicants are not subjected to emotional decision making we saw banks and mortgage lenders making in 2008, because applicants are judged by an objective algorithm. The place where 360 Group has the most potential is in the Square-like business model of SME (Small-Medium Enterprise) loans: \u201cSME loans (including e-commerce loans, invoice-based loans) have performed well and shown great growth potential with origination volume reaching RMB3.3bn in Q3\u201d. In my estimation, business loans will become 360 Group\u2019s biggest source of revenue eventually because businesses actually generate returns and have multiple variables for technology to analyze. Looking at housing, there\u2019s little competitive advantage to be created via A.I. loans except for better efficiency than humans (but there\u2019s no shortage of workers in China, so the efficiency gained by AI in these loans may be irrelevant). However, QFIN was able to make consumer credit for day-to-day purchases much more lucrative: \u201cThe virtual credit-card V-Pocket continued to progress well. It is an effective way to boost credit line drawdown and enhance customer stickiness. The daily origination volume remains above RMB50 mm, and the cumulative origination volume has surpassed RMB10 bn.\u201d This will be an extremely high-growth product as the developing Chinese economy becomes more consumerist and demands more convenience (in China, e-commerce has seen far better growth and more consistent demand than in the US) \n\n99.5% of 360\u2019s credit applications are completed entirely by AI. \n\nIn order to push their service out, 360 Digitech has partnered with the Google of China, Baidu as a platform to acquire new users. 360 Group also partnered with Meituan, an integrated online seller of entertainment, dining, delivery, travel, and other luxury goods (think of it like an actually successful Groupon, a platform that helps you plan and pay for an itinerary). Due to this early consolidation, QFIN has seen a significant increase in free cash flow, and this demonstrates their potential for more investment and growth in the future, but it also demonstrates stability as they have far more flexibility with this liquidity on hand. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4mypfwqzffn61.png?width=594&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7200f453cb229bc515a6b8024910efee2c3c9d3\n\nOn top of this stellar growth in profits, QFIN has an overall very profitable product, with an astounding 89% gross profit margin, and a 21.6% net profit margin (both are improvements from last year\u2019s unprofitable year).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img fizepnn0gfn61...*\n\nOn top of this, QFIN has a very asset-light model that results in low investment required to make disproportionately good returns, which is why within 2 years they\u2019re already having 12% ROA, 38% ROE, and 32.7% ROI\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bzq08pf1gfn61.png?width=183&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=500cbfce0405952e822c46eef7625785af5e4133\n\nIn spite of this growing profitability, QFIN only has a P/E ratio of 8.3 right now at a price of \\~21.25$ at the time of this being written. I\u2019d mostly compare QFIN to PDD, which has also seen similar growth due to their product with the agricultural population in China. Financing is arguably even more important than commercialization, and PDD trades at a forward P/E of 477 whereas QFIN trades at a forward P/E of only 5. PDD trades at about 28x Sales but QFIN trades at 1.76x Sales. This is partially because it\u2019s a newer company, and another part because it\u2019s involved in the heavily-regulated Chinese financial sector. This can actually turn out to be a blessing for it however, as China has restricted the IPO of ANT group due to its potential in destabilizing banks, however for 360 Group, they very literally own a 30% stake in a traditional Chinese bank, making it far more favorable in the eyes of regulators. In their leadership, 360 Group has talent from UBS/BofA and technology professionals from Baidu. Their experienced leadership and small size with a low valuation makes them a prime candidate to be the stars in the eyes of American institutions, and we should be hoping to see a second climb here that was far more impressive than the first one.   \n\\*I WROTE THIS A WHILE BACK, THEREFORE SOME OF THE VALUATION HAS GROWN SINCE THE ER CAME OUT, BUT MANY OF THE FUNDAMENTALS REMAIN THE SAME\\*\n\nPositions 4/16 40c, shares",

Besides covid-friendly, this is also labor saving.\n\n[https://youtu.be/N0S6A6ecBv0](https://youtu.be/N0S6A6ecBv0)\n\nI'm sure no one would short a great company like this, right?\n\nWRONG\n\nWTRH has 98M float with \\~50% tied up by institutions and insiders. With 13M short that gives them about 26% short interest. Not face-ripping levels but enough to add fuel to a fire for sure.\n\nWTRH popped 40% AH last week when the weed integration news broke, but this fizzled when the market crashed. HOWEVER, they still finished + 8% on Friday and report earnings Monday. They might deliver a surprise.\n\nVery sure that WTRH can get caught up in the next weed rotation, but makes a great hold for the business prospects and the acquisition likelihood - I can't imagine an acquisition at less than $8 to $10/share.\n\nAlso, there is goodwill value in the fact their twitter guy is hilarious:\n\n[https://twitter.com/Waitrapp/status/1367595966900019210?s=20](https://twitter.com/Waitrapp/status/1367595966900019210?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/Waitrapp/status/1367599526123560960?s=20](https://twitter.com/Waitrapp/status/1367599526123560960?s=20)\n\nDisclaimer: Long April 4C and plan to add common tomorrow before earnings.\n\n**Join me.**",

Their main competitors are Paypal &amp; Square, but based on EBITDA Paysafe is still **VERY VERY UNDERVALUED.** The gamble/Pro I see here is that Paysafe focuses more on Igaming and gambling, so if you think in next few years this will grow, then this is your horse. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[If you can't count, it means that at same valuation\\/growth as Paypal they are minimum $35 stock...Square closer to $45.](https://preview.redd.it/hf0uywhk9vl61.png?width=1157&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b88a0de69373792d6b6fa84e952efdcfe2bbda7)\n\nNow there are ALOT of smarter apes than me and much more detail online about technicals, growth etc but this is what I see happening. A formula for tendies if you will short term. If you have your own bias, please share in comments.

        "selftext": "\nDISCLOSURE I own 10,000 SHARES of $FTOC may add more or the warrants in the future if price continues to decline. \n\rThe 1 sentence conclusion is that at $11 a share $FTOC seems to provide a good risk/reward. Below I provide a more detailed explanation, the real version would take me 20 pages but this version is for THE REDDITORS!!!\n\rSo, in the past here I have posted about $COTY and $APPH but what many of you may not know about me is that I have been involved in the digital coin and payments space for the past 5 years and have been using Payoneer for years to pay contractors.  Nevertheless, Payoneer is more than that. I understand that at first glance it looks like just another Paypal which is fine because PayPal has been growing and is profitable, even though it took a bit of a hiatus once it was owned by EBAY (Ebay was right to buy them but wrong to not let them grow freely as they could after the spin-off).  \n\rAnyway, I see so many possibilities for Payoneer that I think many are not being considering at all.  Not only is the business going to be growing at LEAST 25% for the next few years but I think it can expand 35% to 50% per year for the next 3 to 5 given the massive shift of online transactions but also new services. To simplify, adding more services to cater their current customers helps them bring in new customers which nets them more revenues and profits. \r\n\nThe issue with Payoneer has been that they never had enough capital to grow or to provide their customers more. It takes a long time to build a really robust and safe payments platform. Payoneer has been around for more than 10 years and it took a lot of capital and development hours to get to where they are today.  The business was limited to transactional growth which is fine but when that is like a profit of like 0.5% (as most goes to the credit card companies or banks) it is hard to grow or ever be profitable.  So, Payoneer for years has been in this stunted growth because of lack of capital or because they are in markets that were \u201chigh risk\u201d, like not being in the USA vs. being in the Ukraine.\n\rI think there are many reasons they did a SPAC and if I were to top it off it is because they failed to do an IPO a long time ago, capital is expensive via private transactions and it would never be enough.  So, yes they could have done raises of $50mm every year but in this type of industry when you have so many competitors who have tens of billions of revenues and hundreds of billions of transaction volume you need a lot more to be able to compete.  $500 million makes you a pretty major player in the game vs. struggling with small raises.  Definitely not ideal for shareholders but in the long-term it is the best way to assure your business can compete at the very least survive.   \n\rWhen I usually look into these stock ideas or analysis I go through a process but here on REDDIT I feel I need to provide a sort of cliffs notes because I can really go into a deep dive analysis of like 10 to 20 pages to really understand the entire business, how it makes or loses money. So I will to the best of my ability be concise but deep with my knowledge of the business. \n\rBusiness model\rHere are all of the products that Payoneer offers its customers. \rGlobal Payments, Multi-currency account, physical and virtual cards, B2B accounts payable and accounts receivable, working capital, merchant services, compliance and tax. \n\rSo, it is basically a bank that includes an accountant to help meet a business\u2019 needs. The one product or feature that is missing is digital coins and no doubt they will be offering that soon, if anything they should make that a major priority. \n\rWho are their customers and where are they know?\r5 million businesses in 190 countries. Customers include Amazon, Wish, Lazada (owned by Alibaba) Shopee, and Ebay. Weird right, they work with Ebay given Paypal does too.  This is because they work with countries and specific clients that Paypal not accept into their platform. Investors need to understand that sometimes people have to use other platforms because they the Paypal\u2019s or banks are NOT willing to take the risk.  Sure the risk is probably higher but the amount of people that need access to capital or payment process is high when many banks in many countries do not approve people for such type of access.  \n\rWhat are the growth drivers?\rAcquisition in new or existing markets (which drives better margins) and working capital for some of their customers (not all) which is what helps Amazon and Paypal grow their business.  When someone makes a transaction say buyer and seller the bank or credit card companies make fees but when both consumer and business use Payoneer exclusively they avoid transaction fees with banks which is why these platforms push or provide discounts for encouraging transactions within the same network vs. out of network.  Over time more and more transactions will be within network, just takes more people to be part of the ecosystem. \n\rWhat are the revenues of the business? Company estimates. \r2020  $346mm\r*2021 $432 mm\r*2022 $540 mm\rWhat do I think actually happens?\r2020 $350 to $400mm\r2021 $450 to $550mm\r2022 $600 to $700mm\rWhy?  Because $500 million of capital allows you to expand faster than before and I think the management has been prudent not to be so aggressive in their esimtates because I don\u2019t think anyone can believe they can so more than 35% a year but I do.  \n\rWhat does that say about valuation? \rWell, Paypal at its spin-off inception traded as low as 5x revenue but growing 15% to 20% a year and when it had $11 billion in revenues now it is growing same rate but trading at 15x Revenue. That means that given Payoneer is growing double the rate and 95% smaller they can command a higher multiple but for the sake of being \u201cconservative\u201d let\u2019s use 5x revenue as the TROUGH valuation and 20x revenue as the PEAK. \n\r2020  $346mm  Trough is $1.75 billion or $4.60 a share. Peak is $6.92 Billion or $18.21 \r*2021 $432mm Trough is $2.16 Billion or $5.70 a share. Peak is $8.64 billion which is $22.75 a share. \r*2022 $540 mm Tough is $2.70 Billion or $7 a share. Peak is $10.8 Billion or $28 a share. \n\rIf you used my estimates it would be the following\r2021 $450 to $550mm Trough is $6 or Peak of $29\r2022 $600 to $700mm Tough is $7.89 or Peak of $36.84\rGiven the current price of $11 it becomes a 4 up and 1 down scenario, a good risk/reward bet. \n\rWhat do I think the future holds for Payoneer?\rI actually think there are several exits for this company. \r1.\tCompany continues to grow and eventually reach billions or revenue within 5 to 10 years. So many factors and things that can happen since sometimes a 10x of revenue growth does not always mean 10x in stock price, could be -50% (due to massive dilution or debt) or 10,000% (no dilution, growth increasing, becomes a top 5 player).  So consider that when you get too enthusiastic about prospects there is always a downside. \r2.\tLarge international payments processer buys them. Could be Paypal, Square, Stripe, First Data, etc. consolidation WILL happen in this space and I think short-term Payoneer will acquire some companies and then be sold to a bigger company.  Think of this as how banks in the USA were allowed to merge in 1995 given the law that passed.  Before you had 100,000 banks then it was 50,000 banks, then 10,000 banks and now like 5,000 banks but the top 10 banks make up a large % of the business/volume. \r3.\tWildcard: CRM business buys them. What many people do not realize is that CRM\u2019s have been changing the game.  First it was to help you sell with marketing tools, then it is to improve communication within the team, then it will be storage, and legal transactions then it will be financial transaction.  They are literally going to control the beginning to the end of the customer relationship and all of that data they possess is very valuable to help their customers grow. \r\rConclusion:  $FTOC provides a good risk reward and many ways to play the exit depending on your risk tolerance.  \rIf you like my analysis please share with other people and if you want me to look at a company and provide an analysis like this I can do that for a small fee. Nevertheless, I welcome everyone and anyone here to discuss all of the good and bad about $FTOC because that I love about the Reddit community is how open, transparent and sometimes incredibly funny you all are. \n\rGood luck to every one! \rValue Maverick",

        "selftext": "Hello fellow degenerates,\n\nAllow me to begin by saying \ud83d\ude80. \n\nToday I would like to tell you all about MOGO and why I think it's a huge play right now. First, a little bit about the company if you aren't familiar with it:\n\n\"Mogo (TSX: MOGO; NASDAQ: MOGO) \u2014 a financial technology company \u2014 offers a finance app that empowers consumers with simple solutions to help them get in control of their financial health and be more mindful of the impact they have on society and the planet. We all know it\u2019s time to do things differently. It\u2019s time for a new way to manage our money, one that\u2019s inclusive and sustainable. One that takes into account our financial health, the planet\u2019s health and the health of our society. At Mogo, users can sign up for a free account in only three minutes and begin to learn the 4 habits of financial health and get convenient access to products that can help them achieve their financial goals and have a positive impact on the planet including a digital spending account with Mogo Visa\\* Platinum Prepaid Card featuring automatic carbon offsetting, free monthly credit score monitoring, ID fraud protection and personal loans. The Mogo platform has been purpose-built to deliver a best-in-class digital experience, with best-in-class products all through one account. With more than one million members and a marketing partnership with Canada's largest news media company, Mogo continues to execute on its vision of becoming the go-to financial app for the next generation of Canadians.\"\n\nNow you may be wondering why the fuck you should invest in a Canadian finances app with their stupid cold weather and relatively tiny economy, but here's the kicker. MOGO recently announced an expansion into the US digital payments market through their wholly-owned subsidiary \"Carta Worldwide\". Being a large player in the Canadian market already and expanding into the US market gives MOGO exposure to a $500 BILLION digital payments market. That's fucking massive and we all know digital payments aren't going away anywhere anytime soon since we are all literally half-digital cyborgs already (according to Elon Musk) and we will only become more and more digital. \n\nMOGO is sitting at a market cap &lt; 500M at the time of writing which leaves an INSANE amount of growth potential, considering the market share of the top digital finance companies in the market right now (looking at you SQ - 100B, PYPL - 300B). Now I'm not saying MOGO will reach these levels (who knows, maybe in 10-20 years), but the market is definitely there for some big time growth. \n\nNOW, another very interesting aspect of this play is MOGO's strategic acquisition of a large portion of CoinSquare, Canada's top digital asset trading platform. That's right, these guys have an amazing financial app, they're actively expanding into the US, AND THEY'RE BALLS DEEP IN C\\*YPTO. They are literally giving customers free b\\*tcoin cash back on purchases, turning almost all of their users into long-term hodlers. This is a GENIUS play because it gives people exposure to digital assets, which creates more interest in digital assets, which comes back to help their business that is, once again, BALLS DEEP IN C\\*YPTO. I love it. \n\nFinally, we have an earnings report coming up in 2 weeks. There is almost no way these guys miss their earnings estimate and it's much more likely that they're about to hit it out of the park in 2 weeks. If nothing else, this is a solid ER run up play but personally I see value in a medium-long term hold. \n\nTLDR: MOGO is a Canadian financial app that allows people to take control of their own finances. They have made a lot of moves recently (in the past month or so) to really set themselves up to BLOW UP in the US markets. If nothing else, keep an eye out for the earnings report coming out in 2 weeks, or get in and out quick for a quick profit, but I believe in the medium-long term.\n\nTLDR of TLDR:  \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 short-term and long-term\n\n\\*\\*\\*Not Financial Advice, please don't be mean about my DD, I tried my best and would appreciate some feedback on what I can do better.\\*\\*\\*",

If you like to gamble and game, buy Paysafe (BFT) \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80. Short term, I see this **above $25 before end of April**.\n\nNow if you are still reading and not eating your colorful crayons, good for you. I want to do a deeper dive into Paysafe/BFT short-term, my positions and what I think a safe floor is. An amazing DD which initially got me can be found here by non other than [dhsmatt2/](https://www.reddit.com/user/dhsmatt2/): [Original DD on $BFT](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kaabxa/700000_bet_on_fintech_bft/)\n\nFirstly, Paysafe/BFT is the main payment processors for igaming &amp; gambling in U.S &amp; massive in Europe. If we think short-term next few weeks, we have three events I love. 1) Roblox IPO 2) March Madness 3) Merger Vote\n\n1. **Roblox IPO-** This will occur tomorrow. Now, many of you are very excited about this and following recent trends of anticipated IPO's in last 6 months (Air BNB, Dash, AI, Snowflake) all have opened 1.5-2x of original price.

Now, BFT/Paysafe is used by the big boys of online gambling too. I have put photos below that show the online gambling paysafe connections. With recent dip in market, SPAC's got wiped out. This went from $18-$19ish a stock to $12.50 last week...back to $15 but with March Madness it will rise with the tide ($DKNG uses them too)\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nGambling/ online sports betting. Take a bet on idiots betting will grow. You like $Penn and $DKNG, then you should love $BFT\n\n3) **Merger Date-** Get your calendars out you autist. March 25th. BFT will vote to merge and become PSFE. Now if you don't know much about big dick bill and SPAC's...the man is not known to miss. He isn't here to fuck spiders or eat rocks. He gets things done &amp; this is his biggest puppy. ALL news (please share if you find otherwise) is pointing to this Merging &amp; once it breaks away from SPAC, I think the massess will be BUYING. Institutions have not been able to get their greedy fingers on this yet, but I think when they can, they will eat this up. \n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nIf you can read, please do\n\nNow before you spit all your crayons out at once and say whats the catch, the catch is this is a VERY VERY competitive market. Their main competitors are Paypal &amp; Square, but based on EBITDA Paysafe is still **VERY VERY UNDERVALUED.** The gamble/Pro I see here is that Paysafe focuses more on Igaming and gambling, so if you think in next few years this will grow, then this is your horse.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nIf you can't count, it means that at same valuation/growth as Paypal they are minimum $35 stock...Square closer to $45.\n\nNow there are ALOT of smarter apes than me and much more detail online about technicals, growth etc but this is what I see happening. A formula for tendies if you will short term. If you have your own bias, please share in comments. It should also be noted that as a SPAC, institutions haven't been able to get their slimy hands on it, which again will result in long-term growth as I see them EATING this up.\n\n\\*Roblox IPO + March Madness + Merger + Market recovery with stimi + Hedges beginning to pick up positions + experts saying fair-value/floor is $26 (lowest I could find)\\****= 60% upside on boomer stonks or 5x on calls in next month. I see end of April, $30+ for the stock.***\n\n*Positions: 380 shares at $13.50 15x $15c 10/15/21 (bought on dip) &amp; continuing to add 5x 4/16/21 $15.5 and 20x 4/16/21 $20c*\n\nBUY THE DIPS, EAT YOUR CRAYONS &amp; SEE YOU ON THE MOON",

I\u2019m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.\n\n## Investing in Internet Forums\n\nIn my view, Pinterest can be one of the most sound social-networking investments.  Let\u2019s keep one question in mind:\n\n&gt;Did Facebook\u2019s implementation of a hashtag kill Twitter?\n\nUltimately, what drives a social-networking site is a user\u2019s incentive to search and discover information in that particular forum. As a result, examining social-networking sites can be a lot like comparing shopping centers, such that a shopper is incentivized to go to a location for a particular reason that is served by that institution. Pinterest uses pins, Reddit uses subreddits, and Google uses websites - all having unique advantages as a means to distribute information. \n\n[Pinterest is a search engine.](https://preview.redd.it/nv6rme6vm3n61.png?width=1780&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40d66cfd12f7dfe113f059548b78caf90273acea)\n\nThe forum may take on a different medium, but it is ultimately a forum none the less. If we try to categorize it roughly, the forums would look like this:\n\n* Google is fueled by user\u2019s need for answered information.\n* Facebook is fueled by a user\u2019s need to connect.\n* Pinterest is fueled by a user\u2019s need for ideas.\n* Reddit is fueled by a user\u2019s need for community.\n* Online video games are fueled by a user\u2019s need for adventure.\n\nWith this basic model, you can argue which forum may be inelastic. In my view, it ranks like this, where the top rank is the most inelastic due to human behavior:\n\n1. Google (need for information)\n2. Games (need for adventure)\n3. Reddit (need for community)\n4. Pinterest (need for ideas)\n5. Facebook (need to connect)\n\nThe reason I rank Facebook as the most elastic version is because I have already witnessed multiple transformations resulting in users connecting in various ways (Myspace, Twitter, Discord, TikTok). I eventually expect this to replicate in other nations too because doing everything is simply just weird and scares users off. I also believe that people really underestimate how quickly humans find new ways to connect and can move to another platform for connection; which is quite a common occurrence in online gaming.\n\n## Searching\n\nThat being said, I think Pinterest is wonderfully positioned and has quite an interesting history. The network-effect that built Pinterest was mostly driven by women, which has profound economic consequences. As a result, Pinterest\u2019s recommendation model is geared to advertise to women-influenced interests and has already adopted the technology to be used a certain way: a search engine for ideas which is now beginning to permeate in households internationally.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Pinterest user's \\\\\"finding or shopping for products\\\\\" differential is extremely large.](https://preview.redd.it/ksemsx8jr3n61.png?width=1158&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35d8453fe3817558695c5814bf53d6273a5347ed)\n\n[Network: husbands, families, friends, mom groups](https://preview.redd.it/za1gqu7oo3n61.png?width=1936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6eb084b211e277732f2d8b82ba4cc3bad655e74)\n\nThis has long-term positive consequences for product messengers that can be the subject of such idea searches regardless of your culture. You can try it yourself to understand; it feels like what you want Google Images to do for you at times:\n\n\\- Birthday gift ideas (Michaels, Corsair) \n\n\\- Skincare ideas (Target) \n\n\\- Tips for traveling to another area (AirBnB) \n\n\\- Home construction (Sherwin-Williams, James hardie)\n\n\\- Omnichannel support from places like TikTok, Zoom, Etsy\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img q7glbuzfp3n61...*\n\n[House Interior Paint](https://preview.redd.it/q8rx75d3p3n61.png?width=3718&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c705c2365461dd710978c171cb1234695105dadc)\n\nThe fact is, it\u2019s the user who is actually voluntarily searching for ads in an ad space. Behaviorally, this means that Pinterest\u2019s users are in a \u201chigh willingness to engage\u201d with things that result in \u201caction\u201d. That is, a Pinterest user is logging in because they need to start something or they need to plan for something in the near future. This is basically a sweet spot for advertisers, as they know they\u2019re getting top real estate on BOTH Google and Pinterest as a result of their product design.\n\nPinterest was not designed to make a user spend hours mindlessly scrolling for content. It was designed to make a sale and keep a customer happy *outside* of Pinterest. That is fundamentally different than Facebook\u2019s connect-everything approach to social-networking.\n\n## The Design\n\nPinterest ranks high in Google\u2019s results for specific reasons. Pinterest develops its own in-app browser that has particular consequences for:\n\n1. Security &amp; Privacy\n2. High demand for high quality ad-messaging and visuals\n3. Vectors to user\u2019s websites generated by hosts like Shopify or Wordpress.\n4. Vectors for advertisers\n5. A browser that follows Progressive Web App standards\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hdp9d130r3n61.png?width=2595&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47b5bcf48b44d76b0549bb8558a53db963999335\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe combination of these design choices ranks it high in \u201cGoogle\u2019s algorithm\u201d, while this search engine result increases its bar for ranking each year. This means that bigger organizations like Twitter, Doordash, and Pinterest will enjoy the tailwinds of these priorities.\n\nWhy is Google doing this? Because they want high web standards as a global competitor. Part of the global competition is shaping the internet\u2019s develop to consider people that have high latency connections since software can scale faster than some of the hardware that is available around the globe. The internet is ultimately \u201caccess to information\u201d, which is as scarce as \u201caccess to clean water\u201d around the globe. So it\u2019s carefully considered in strong engineering communities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n0nqtvdvp3n61.png?width=2233&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2dbae8ede64d5b1271c6ea3c4408f080efd4beb9\n\n## Summary\n\nI believe Pinterest qualifies as an excellent investment. I totally love the fact that the network-effect behind Pinterest is built by women, but not necessarily for women. I am carefully monitoring the results of this network-effect as I believe that it will have long-term consequences on family life. I feel that this kind of product design will eventually create a deeper gravity for advertisers, where they know that Pinterest users are essentially  sustainable top dollar advertising spaces - as users are looking directly to consume as a result of their usage which is far different than other social-media platform strategies.\n\nI use Facebook and Instagram every day, resulting in nothing. I use Pinterest a few times a month at most. The difference is, every time I use Pinterest - I follow up or plan to follow up with some consumer behavior. That, to me, is incredible.\n\nPls follow for more essays.\n\n[https://static.jeffbullas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Pinterest-vs-Facebook-Social-Commerce-Infographic.jpg](https://static.jeffbullas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Pinterest-vs-Facebook-Social-Commerce-Infographic.jpg)",

This is basically a sweet spot for advertisers, as they know they\u2019re getting top real estate on BOTH Google and Pinterest as a result of their product design.\n\nPinterest was not designed to make a user spend hours mindlessly scrolling for content. It was designed to make a sale and keep a customer happy *outside* of Pinterest. That is fundamentally different than Facebook\u2019s connect-everything approach to social-networking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The growing competition](https://preview.redd.it/li1aniqbw3n61.png?width=1332&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e0aa87909dfe6bc27be6149c6b7d08dab313230)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## The Design\n\nPinterest ranks high in Google\u2019s results for specific reasons. Pinterest develops its own in-app browser that has particular consequences for:\n\n1. Security &amp; Privacy\n2. High demand for high quality ad-messaging and visuals\n3. Vectors to user\u2019s websites generated by hosts like Shopify, Walmart, or other omnichannels.\n4. Vectors for advertisers\n5. A browser that follows Progressive Web App standards\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe combination of these design choices ranks it high in \u201cGoogle\u2019s algorithm\u201d, while this search engine result increases its bar for ranking each year. This means that bigger organizations like Twitter, Doordash, and Pinterest will enjoy the tailwinds of these priorities.\n\nWhy is Google doing this? Because they want high web standards as a global competitor. Part of the global competition is shaping the internet\u2019s develop to consider people that have high latency connections since software can scale faster than some of the hardware that is available around the globe. The internet is ultimately \u201caccess to information\u201d, which is as scarce as \u201caccess to clean water\u201d around the globe. So it\u2019s carefully considered in strong engineering communities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Google's PWA preferences in search results](https://preview.redd.it/ispmbg0ew3n61.png?width=2233&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62ed8d4a74c530fe6d2b66565c0621318a88a4c8)\n\n## Summary\n\nI totally love the fact that the network-effect behind Pinterest is built by women, but not necessarily for women. I am carefully monitoring the results of this network-effect as I believe that it will have long-term consequences on family life. I feel that this kind of product design will eventually create a deeper gravity for advertisers, where they know that Pinterest users are essentially  sustainable top dollar advertising spaces - as users are looking directly to consume as a result of their usage which is far different than other social-media platform strategies.\n\nI use Facebook and Instagram every day, resulting in nothing. I use Pinterest a few times a month at most. The difference is, every time I use Pinterest - I follow up or plan to follow up with some consumer behavior. That, to me, is incredible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/53flgvucw3n61.png?width=2595&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f170bfa2c403d2e5f88e7c5014d506845fbc7dcb\n\n[https://static.jeffbullas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Pinterest-vs-Facebook-Social-Commerce-Infographic.jpg](https://static.jeffbullas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Pinterest-vs-Facebook-Social-Commerce-Infographic.jpg)",
