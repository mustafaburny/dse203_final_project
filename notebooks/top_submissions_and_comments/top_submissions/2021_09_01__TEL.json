        "selftext": "Matterport will create a digital clone of our world for the metaverse.\n\nBefore I explain how, check out my previous DD posts for some context.  \n[MTTR Bringing 3D Photogrammetry Experiences](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ou2ap9/mttr_bringing_3d_photogrammetry_experiences_to/)  \n[MTTR Explosive Potential](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p3469k/mttr_update_explosive_avenues_of_potential/)\n\nNow, you\u2019re probably wondering \u201cWhat is the metaverse u/cru3211?\u201d\n\nLet me tell you.\n\n# The Metaverse\n\nThe **metaverse** is a paradigm shift in the way we organize ourselves as a society. It\u2019s an evolutionary embodiment of technology &amp; the internet. It\u2019s commonly envisioned as a \u201csecond layer\u201d to our world. Sort of like\u2026 a virtual clone of it\u2026 that\u2019s digitized. See where this is going?\n\nThis is the **spatial web**. It represents an emerging three-dimensional web experience. It\u2019ll blow the old internet out of the water.\n\nresearch: metaverse, web 3.0, and spatial web for more insights.\n\nMSG me and I\u2019ll ramble more about the metaverse. For now, just understand that it\u2019s an inevitable innovation that will see widespread growth within the next decade. Matterport is likely (but not guaranteed) to be a part of this evolution.\n\n# Government Contract\n\nMatterport has entered the public sector to digitize the valuable assets of the US government.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\u201cThrough the use of Matterport\u2019s technology, federal agencies will be  \nable to *digitize and index* government facilities, infrastructure and  \nother assets such ***as airplanes, ships and submarines.\u201d***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n\u201cFor example, in the event of an emergency, digital twins of  \n**buildings, roads, bridges, tunnels, water supplies or electrical grids** can be instantly viewed and analyzed by authorized users to  \nrespond more efficiently\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n\u201cAccess to 3D digital twins and the spatial data behind them can fuel  \na multitude of use cases such as **emergency response, military**  \n**training and historical preservation**.\u201d - George Hoyem at In-Q-Tel\n\nHow could you not be bullish? They\u2019re creating a private searchable 3D database. This is immensely powerful. Imagine being able to visualize the entire underground infrastructure of NYC without having to dig everything up? \n\n# Collaboration Tool\n\nYou know how on Google docs you can live collaborate with other users on a doc? I use it all the time. Matterport just added that for digital twins. That leads me to my next point.\n\n# Prediction:\n\nI\u2019ve come to believe that Google will want Matterport. I have no evidence of this, it\u2019s just a feeling. This is because the two companies align in a variety of ways. (I guess Google could just develop their own tech, but I just feel like they might take the easy route and acquire.)\n\n* Google Earth has exteriors of 3D buildings, but not interiors. Imagine how Matterport\u2019s 3D dataset could be utilized for that tool?\n* Matterport and Google are both platform companies with a focus on big data and indexing that data.\n* Google Real-estate searching was removed about a decade ago, but what if this was the catalyst for them to bring it back. I predict that Google will bring back real estate searching but integrate it with 3D interactive experiences.\n* Google\u2019s AI research could be fueled by Matterport\u2019s datasets.\n* Matterport could be integrated with Google\u2019s suite of apps.\n\n**My positions:**  \n100 shares at $14. Some calls expiring from Sept \u2013 December ranging from $17.5 - $25.",
