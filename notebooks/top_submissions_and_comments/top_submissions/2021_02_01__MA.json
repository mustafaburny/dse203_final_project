        "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/17/blackrock-has-started-to-dabble-in-bitcoin-says-rick-rieder.html\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Rick Rieder told CNBC on Wednesday the world\u2019s largest asset manager has begun entering the bitcoin space.\n\nThe remarks from Rieder, who is BlackRock\u2019s chief investment officer of global fixed income, came on the same day bitcoin broke above $51,000 for the first time.\n\n\u201cToday the volatility of it is extraordinary, but listen, people are looking for storehouses of value,\u201d Rieder said on \u201cSquawk Box.\u201d \u201cPeople are looking for places that could appreciate under the assumption that inflation moves higher and that debts are building, so we\u2019ve started to dabble a bit into it.\u201d\n\nIn January, BlackRock added bitcoin futures as an potential investment for two of its funds, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The funds are BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities and BlackRock Global Allocation Fund.\n\nA number of other financial institutions, such as BNY Mellon and Mastercard, have made entrances into the crypto space in recent days. BNY Mellon, the nation\u2019s oldest bank, will launch a digital assets unit later this year, while Mastercard intends to support certain cryptocurrencies on its formal network.\n\nElectric vehicle maker Tesla also announced last week it bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin using cash on its balance sheet and intends to begin accepting the digital coin as payment for its products.\n\nThe price of bitcoin has risen more than 70% this year, adding to a major rally that began in the fall. \u201cMy sense is the technology has evolved and the regulation has evolved to the point where a number of people find it should be part of the portfolio, so that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the price up,\u201d Rieder said.\n\nDespite bitcoin\u2019s growing respectability as an asset class, Rieder said Wednesday that how much exposure an investor should have \u201cdepends on what the rest of your portfolio looks like.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re holding a lot more cash than we\u2019ve held historically,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s because duration doesn\u2019t work, interest rates don\u2019t work as a hedge and so diversifying into other assets makes some sense. Holding some portion of what you hold in cash in things like crypto seems to make some sense to me, but I wouldn\u2019t espouse a certain allocation or target holding.\u201d",

        "selftext": "I along with probably many others here are new to the trading world. GME sparked our interest but we know this isn't how the market usually works. With that being said, I've been doing some research on the different features and functions provided in different web applications so I figured I'd share some basic info here to try and help some others.\n\nHere is a very basic explanation of the different indicators I have got. I guess some of you already have in your charts.\n\n[Macro sentiment](https://cindicator.com/macrosentiment) \\- This gives weekly indicators and works best when you have a stock portfolio also if you have option trading. Their risk factor is also improved, through their collective intelligence indicators platform which is an interactive platform between the team and its users where they ask questions about the future trends of the market.  \n[BOLL (Bollinger)](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/102201.asp) \\- This finds the position of a security within Bollinger Bands. %B is simply a percentage measure of a security\u2019s location between the bands. %B can be lower than 0 or higher than 100 if price moves outside the bands. Generally speaking, a %B near or above 100 can suggest an overbought market, while a value near or below 0 can indicate an oversold market.\n\n[DC (Donchian Channels)](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/donchianchannels/) \\- Are used in technical analysis to measure a market's volatility. It is a banded indicator, similar to Bollinger Bands %B. Besides measuring a market's volatility, Donchian Channels are primarily used to identify potential breakouts or overbought/oversold conditions when price reaches either the Upper or Lower Band. These instances would indicate possible trading signals.\n\n[EMA (Exponential Moving Average)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ema.asp) \\- This is a technical chart indicator that tracks the price of an investment (like a stock or commodity) over time. The EMA is a type of weighted moving average (WMA) that gives more weighting or importance to recent price data.\n\n[IC (Ichimoku Cloud)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ichimoku-cloud.asp) \\- A collection of technical indicators that show support and resistance levels, as well as momentum and trend direction. It does this by taking multiple averages and plotting them on the chart. It also uses these figures to compute a \"cloud\" which attempts to forecast where the price may find support or resistance in the future.\n\n[KC (Keltner Channels)](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502266-keltner-channels-kc/) \\- A banded indicator similar to Bollinger Bands and Moving Average Envelopes. They consist of an Upper Envelope above a Middle Line as well as a Lower Envelope below the Middle Line. The Middle Line is a moving average of price over a user-defined time period. Either a simple moving average or an exponential moving average are typically used. The Upper and Lower Envelopes (user defined) are set a range away from the Middle Line. This can be a multiple of the daily high/low range, or more commonly a multiple of the Average True Range.\n\nMA (Moving Average) - A simple technical analysis tool that smooths out price data by creating a constantly updated average price. The average is taken over a specific period of time, like 10 days, 20 minutes, 30 weeks or any time period the trader chooses. There are advantages to using a moving average in your trading, as well as options on what type of moving average to use. Moving average strategies are also popular and can be tailored to any time frame, suiting both long-term investors and short-term traders.\n\nPivot Point - A technical analysis indicator, or calculations, used to determine the overall trend of the market over different time frames. The pivot point itself is simply the average of the intraday high and low, and the closing price from the previous trading day. On the subsequent day, trading above the pivot point is thought to indicate ongoing bullish sentiment, while trading below the pivot point indicates bearish sentiment.\n\nSAR - The Parabolic SAR is a technical indicator developed by J. Welles Wilder to determine the direction that an asset is moving. The indicator is also referred to as a stop and reverse system, which is abbreviated as SAR. It aims to identify potential reversals in the price movement of traded assets. It can also be used to provide entry and exit points.\n\nSuperTrend - This indicator works well in a trending market but can give false signals when a market is trading in a range. It uses the ATR (average true range) as part of its calculation which takes into account the volatility of the market. The ATR is adjusted using the multiplier setting which determines how sensitive the indicator is.",

        "selftext": "**TL;DR:**\n\n**1. Check all of your credit and debit cards for fraudulent charges. There are reports of a tidal wave of fraudulent charges across different banks and payment networks.**\n\n**2. Let's get to the bottom of this and buy the puts that will send us to Valhalla. Currently, there is no mainstream reporting of these fraud charges. I have puts on BBVA, FIS, and FISV**\n\nAgain, check all of your debit cards and credit cards for unauthorized transactions. Some of the more common ones are \"coloadtest,\" \"Angela Singleton,\" Spotify, \"sumup,\" \"wfxb,\" and \"amzn\\[.\\]com.\" Report the transactions as fraudulent so that your card gets locked instead of simply disputing the charge.\n\n# Tidal wave of fraud charges\n\nIn the links below, you will find pages of people reporting small and large fraudulent transactions.  I've read 300+ comments of affected people. Many of them note that customer service has told them that a lot of other people are disputing similar fraud charges. Moreover, these charges are bizarre in their diversity of payment networks, banks, and \"workarounds\" that they use. E.g. Some fraudulent charges are on prepaid gift cards. Some fraudulent charges are on cards that were cancelled, re-sent, and fraudulently charged while still in the mail. Some fraudulent charges posted to cards that were closed (possibly by manipulating a recurring charge mechanism). Below are links to some of the data points, I broke the links because my previous submissions were autospammed, sorry. There is also a table below where I summarized some of the data before I got tired of data entry.\n\nMost data: *doctorofcreditDOTcom/widespread-unauthorized-transactions-check-your-accounts-coloadtest-com-sumup/*\n\n[reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lnb1yq/coloadtestcom\\_charge/](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lnb1yq/coloadtestcom_charge/)\n\n[reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/lms5u5/unrecognized\\_charge\\_from\\_coloadtestcom/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/lms5u5/unrecognized_charge_from_coloadtestcom/)\n\n[reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/lmdbq9/my\\_bank\\_account/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/lmdbq9/my_bank_account/)\n\n[reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/lppyi3/reports\\_of\\_widespread\\_unauthorized\\_card/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/lppyi3/reports_of_widespread_unauthorized_card/)\n\ndoctorofcreditDOTcom/al-fl-tx-az-co-ca-nm-bbva-select-credit-card-500-bonus/\n\n*bogleheadsDOTorg/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=340580&amp;p=5827773*\n\n*early-retirementDOTorg/forums/f27/unauthorized-charge-from-coloadtest-com-108007.html*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This is only from the more recent data on the doctorofcredit link](https://preview.redd.it/aov4c1axz9j61.png?width=1798&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=520608861f616b63a254c98b9e587ecce19c8a7a)\n\nCollaborator [u/Wise\\_Hope\\_3654](https://www.reddit.com/u/Wise_Hope_3654/) made this spreadsheet for the Reddit data points: megaDOTnz/file/bggQxARK#haADas8e1JTmMKufpzXWM6RgHn7fR3I-d27Ec4nrYPg\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo summarize the table, almost all major credit card issuing banks and almost all major credit card payment networks have been hit. Mastercard has been maybe less affected. Some cards have only been used once. One card was never used. Some cards were gift cards. Some cards were cancelled and then charged when a new card was sent but before it was received in the mail.\n\nOne of the most interesting leads is the commenter who said this data is being shared on the dark web and he got that from a source called idx (I have no idea what that is).\n\n**Inferences:**\n\n1. This was probably not an attack on a retailer's database because many cards were only used once.\n2. This was probably not an attack on issuing banks since so many were affected. One possible exception is BBVA, since their cards were the victims of the earliest attacks and have been attacked in relatively large quantity.\n3. Likewise, Amex and Visa are more sus than other payment networks, but still not high on the list of suspects.\n4. Some agent that many banks and payment networks use is the most likely culprit. This could be a software vendor. It could be a faulty pipeline to a credit report company (TransUnion, Equifax, Experian) that is adding payment info.\n5. This breach is deep in the system if they are able to hit cards that are ostensibly locked and that are being sent in the mail after the first is cancelled.\n6. Likewise, this is probably not a stale breach from long ago since the fraudsters are able to update their card info to these newly mailed cards.\n7. Many are reporting the same fraudulent charges e.g. coloadtest, Angela Singleton, cfxb, and sumup, so we know these are part of the same breach or set of breaches by the same hacker.\n8. The sumup charges are being sent to Brazil. That's a good place for international financial crimes since Brazil does not extradite citizens.\n\n# Suspicions\n\nI think the most likely source of the quantity and variety of breached cards is a deep attack on a \"acquirer processor.\" An acquirer is the bank that handles the transaction for the merchant. Merchant acquirers are the banks that handle transaction risk. Acquirer processors actually process the transactions. Some banks do both, for example, Chase (JPM). Some banks do not, for example Wells Fargo (WFC), hands off the processing to Fiserv (FISV).\n\nA processor is the most likely to be able to generate the kind of data needed for this attack. They would see data from across many banks and payment networks. They would have the ability to collect new card data after reissues and data from cards that were never used. In the 2011 hack of FIS, the hackers were able to get into prepaid debit card (vanilla gift card) data. That hack led to a sustained 35% downturn in the FIS stock price; I suspect a similar breach will do the same.\n\nkrebsonsecurityDOTcom/2013/06/fdic-2011-fis-breach-worse-than-reported/\n\nI collected data below from people who only ever used their card at a very small number of retailers to get a sense of which acquirer processor is most likely to have been hacked, The data is unfortunately not very conclusive.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/65ya90kc2aj61.png?width=2281&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51aadd82f159f196b5ccc483901f4878abcec3b3\n\nThere's also a possibility that there were multiple breaches and these attacks are being mixed to obscure the origin.\n\n**I'm hoping some of you know more about the innards of the payment network system or legacy software that banks use to support it. I'm hoping that we can put together a case for a most likely suspect company and make a killing with our early DD.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Positions:**\n\nI have a small quantity of OTM puts in BBVA, FIS, and FISV. I'm not ready to YOLO the account until I have more confidence the right targets are selected.\n\n**Edit 1:**\n\na. Be sure to check out the comments below on a potential BIN attack.\n\nb. I got in contact with Angela of the photography business that is supposedly charging some of the payments. They haven't compromised her accounts and are just posing as her so she has no info.",

        "selftext": "TL;DR - Experience mining company that is in growth mode. Launching their own gold-backed cryptocoin next week. This is a fantastic hold or a great 1 week swing play. \n\n- Key levels: $0.28-$0.35\n\n- 1 week PT: $0.50\n\n- Long-term $3+\n\nOn the surface, AABB is a mining company, self-described as a company focused on the production, supply, and sale of precious and base metals primarily in Asian markets. They found great success in the Guerrero Gold Belt property, and were able to finalize 2020 with an all-time high annual gross profit of $16 million. In Q4 2020, AABB ran a pre-feasibility study on their Guerrero Gold Belt property and concluded that the capital required for a large-scale build would not be in the best interest of the company. Instead, they chose to sell and replicate their success at their recently acquired property in Colima, Mexico. \n\nThe Colima property was acquired at the end of October for $1.1 million. Previous geophysics and groundwork have revealed strong indications of significant mineralization in multiple sectors of the property. It\u2019s situated in a region where AABB has a comparative advantage of development resources and expertise readily available to rapidly develop the project.\n\nMid January, they sold it\u2019s mineral property and mining operations facilities in Guerrero Gold Belt for $52 million in cash, $30 million in gold bullion, and 28% equity in Qiangda Investments &amp; Economics Co. Ltd. (QIEC). $10 million from this sale was allocated an initial phase development program at their Colima mine. [Verification of sale](http://mnamexico.com/en/ma-january-2021-2/)\n\nMost recent financial statement does not include this deal. That said, based on this the company's financials look solid with +106.59% net income growth, $5.4 mil in revenue (+135.71% growth) and an EBITDA of +3.59 mil.\n\nOver the past several months, Core State Holdings, Corp. (CSHC) has been developing AABB Wallet and AABB Gold crypto token (ERC20, Ethereum based). AABBG is a gold backed crypto coin. They developed an API linking the real-time exchange rate of gold to each coin, which is valued at 1/10th of a gram of gold. Currently, they are issuing no more than 500,000,000 tokens for sale, which is equivalent to about $2.9 billion in funds. This token is launching this week and currently has 35,040,647 reserved as of February 20th. They plan to continue acquiring mines, at targeted properties in South America, Central America, and Mexico. The launch of AABBG will allow them to leverage their existing assets and tap into the value of future assets and provide the funds needed to do so. \n\nCSHC is also looking to add AABBG into CannaSOS.Shop as a payment method. The main payment processor for this platform will be PTPWallet, which automatically will have AABBG token as a currency option for its users. \n\nThey are in the final stages of collaboration, including market strategy and campaign, launching AABB Wallet on iOS and Android, and expansion of corporate brand. Part of this expansion includes an uplisting. They are currently in the auditing process with a 3rd party, for an uplist to OTCQB. This will be a big step toward a major listing and add further credibility. \n\nAt the beginning of February, AABB announced they retained Integrity Media to manage IR and Corporate Communication. \u201cIntegrity Media is renowned for its elite communication and for their genuine concern for shareholders,\u201d stated James Gilbert, President, Asia Broadband, Inc. \u201cMr. Divich is a highly skilled communicator and as we enter this important new phase for Asia Broadband, his skill set allows us to further increase our transparency.\u201d\n\nIn February of 2020, they acquired a strategic lithium propery in Mexico. [Source](http://mnamexico.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Reporte-Mensual-02-2020-ENG.pdf) No further information has been released about this operation.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, this chart looks like a textbook bull flag. The recent run up has been from the recent hype and specifically the launch of AABBGoldToken.com. Since the run, we\u2019ve seen some healthy consolidation with heavy support around $0.28 and need to test and break $0.35. Some are also reporting that this stock is heavily shorted.\n\nI couldn\u2019t find much info about their leadership team which I would consider one of the primary red flags, however it seems their CEO has decades of experience in the business and has been sharp with his communication and PR timing.",

        "selftext": "***-TLDR, References, Past DDs and Positions at the bottom-***\n\n[Thumbnail](https://imgur.com/a/UMLUgKg)\n\n[https://voltacharging.com/](https://voltacharging.com/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/em47qiocdhh61.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67965c612592697e312771170ca9645aacb14f27\n\nEV chargers. You\u2019re most likely well aware of them through the plethora of recent SPAC mergers (SBE, CLII, TPGY, NBAC). They all do only one thing, charge your car. I mean that\u2019s all they can do right? Well today\u2019s DD is on Volta Charging, in short these guys have found, in my opinion, a superior business model that provides three strong streams of revenue.\n\nLet\u2019s start off with what these streams are :\n\n***Charging*** \\- Almost all EV charging station companies have one thing in common \u2014 either a company hosting the chargers has to pay for them or EV drivers who use them have to pay for them. Volta does things differently. It uses the Google method, or the cable TV method \u2014 the station is free to use, while advertisers pay to get their product or story in front of you.  Volta says on its website that customers on average spend $54 per visit (at locations where the charging points were installed) and they stay there for around 92 minutes.\n\nWhilst being free to use for the EV owner, there is no cost for the business owner to install a Volta Charger either. This is a key point as it drives an incentive for businesses to choose Volta over competitors like Chargepoint, where they would have to purchase it at their own capital expense. The free charging that Volta provides can attract previously unwilling customers towards a business without the business having to be at expense, which occurs in other free charging offerings. This alongside the [unit economics](https://imgur.com/a/NRyFl8T) that are second in revenue to only EVGo provide a competitive advantage that will help them take market share for retail charging. One thing to note is that the payback period per unit averages to 3.6 years.\n\nVolta are the first to provide free DC fast charging (L3) in North America \\[1\\] for up to 30 minutes. If this wasn\u2019t good enough, then after those 30 minutes are up the price per kwH is $0.26 which is even cheaper than Electrify America on it\u2019s membership plan ($0.31 with, $0.43 without). This is followed by free L2 charging for up to 3 hours (depending on the location). Volta\u2019s $0.26 per kWh L3 Charging is cheaper than Blink\u2019s L2 Charging which costs $0.39 - $0.79, in fact the level 3 charging per kWh is cheaper than that of Tesla, EVbox, EVGo and Electrify America \\[2\\].\n\nQuick takes :\n\n* Volta has the highest utilization of any EV charging network in the United States.\n* Volta charging stations already deliver IRR\u2019s in the mid 40%.  As they grow significantly and the network scales, economics should improve even more as EV charging demand increases.\n* Volta currently has over 450 sites, 1,500 stations and 3,000 screens installed \u2013 and a further 470 sites, 1,100 stations and 2,200 screens contracted and in construction.  In addition to this footprint, Volta has developed a pipeline of over 5,000 sites, 10,000 stations and 20,000 screens.\n* Volta does not manufacture their own chargers.\n\nDrivers get free charging, and businesses get more business.\n\n***Advertising*** \\- The reason why Volta undercuts its competition is through it\u2019s ad based revenue. The company operates a network of free charging stations through brand sponsorship that wants to reach highly coveted audiences and local brick and mortar businesses to attract new customers; benefiting brands, consumers, and real-estate locations by providing valuable advertising space to businesses and free charging to drivers.  They are strategically placed in front of essential businesses such as grocery stores, pharmacies, banks and hospitals. Volta\u2019s EV network supports a larger consumer trend towards vehicle electrification by placing fueling stations in parking lots directly where consumers already spend their time and money.\n\nVolta has already signed agreements with retail corporations such as Albertsons, Giant Food, Regency Centers, Wegmans, Amazon, Walgreens, Stop&amp;Shop, Saks Fifth Avenue, and Topgol.  Advertisers have included Netflix, Facebook, Smartwater, Chase, Starbucks, Hulu, Nestl\u00e9, Polestar, Porsche, and Unilever. Some of these agreements are locked in with 10 year contracts.\n\nThese agreements also encourage the upkeep and maintenance of Volta Chargers in order to keep the integrity of the brand image for not only Volta but the advertiser they\u2019re representing. This cannot be said for other free charging solutions whose landlords see no incentive in maintaining something they themselves do not gain profit from.\n\nAd-supported growth is a demonstrated and PROVEN business model.\n\n***Data, Behaviour and Networking***  \\-  The final stream of revenue is through behavioural data that\u2019s collected relative to the location, this can include length of stay, model of car, stores nearby, frequency of visits etc. This data can then be sold off to companies who require the customer data whilst also helping to improve Volta\u2019s own predictive algorithm which allows them to estimate the current and future demand for certain locations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 4cuimn1zfhh61...*\n\n**Management, Transaction, Valuation and Revenue :**\n\nThe management for Volta is strong. How? Well for starters ***the co-founder and former president of Chargepoint is the CTO*** \\[4\\]. This alongside the ex Tesla and Amazon employees that can provide potential leeway for future deals, shows that the management is used to disruption and highly familiar with the industry. The variety in backgrounds can provide multiple perspectives allowing them to become agile in this fast and booming market. This can be seen on their site where they highlight who in their team are EV drivers and who aren't.\n\nEven in 2020, with the pandemic disrupting the economy, Volta ended the year experiencing \\~50% revenue growth, underscoring its diversified and resilient revenue stack. Multiple revenue streams include Pay Per Use, Idle Fees, Managed Services, &amp; Fleet.\n\nBiden has made electrification a focal point of his plan to combat climate change, including a plan to invest $2 trillion into electrification and renewables, which includes the installation of 500,000 public charging stations in the next four years. Furthermore, states are also making a push for electrification.CA, MA, &amp; NJ all have announced plans for new car sales to be zero-emission vehicles by 2035. Furthermore, NY approved $700m to fund EV charging infrastructure for multiple utilities and CA created a $436m Charge Ready infrastructure program.\n\n* Unlike competitors, strong unit economics will allow Volta to reach positive EBITDA in the near term (by 2023).\n* $300m PIPE anchored by long term holders including Fidelity, Blackrock, &amp; Neuberger Berman.\n* Deal to close Q2 (most likely late Q2)\n* Based off the 2024E or 2025E rev multiples of $CLII, $SBE, $TPGY looks like[ $SNPR](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SNPR&amp;src=cashtag_click) could settle in the $35 area - u/apan-man seen below :\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/368mveoidhh61.png?width=1099&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55ed8d23a596495570447563072d05124b4ea97a\n\n* ChargePoint has 73% of the entire L2 charging market share, Volta has 2%. Chargepoint is generating $130 million in revenue vs Volta\u2019s $25 million.\n* 17% minority ownership stake which is higher than SBE\n* 100% 5 year CAGR\n\n**A few bear cases to consider :**\n\nThe first and most obvious one is the fact that their charging network isn't as big as it's competitors, most notably Chargepoint who has benefited greatly from the first mover advantage. This results in the relatively low revenue of $25m in 2020.\n\nSecondly, the market for EV chargers is saturated, not just the public ones but the countless private companies that are available such as EV connect, Flo, Recargo etc. This could result in the EV effect where not all companies will survive. When considering the broader market there is the very real possibility of a sell off in the EV sector, SNPR will most  definitely be impacted by such an event, with its current price of writing hovering at around $15.04 this proposes a 33% loss worst case scenario.\n\nDue to the fact that Volta does not manufacture their own chargers, it could also lead to the potential case of poorer quality control. After some digging through Plugshare and Reddit I haven\u2019t found this to be the case so far, with generally positive reviews throughout ([other than that one dude who had his Tesla Adapter melted](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/caetp7/stumbled_across_these_new_volta_chargers_never/et8n8mb?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)) but it\u2019s still a possibility that should be considered. Another related idea is that free chargers won't be treated as well as ones paid for, this could lead to neglect/misuse of the product.\n\nFinal note, there is a lack of a defined moat. This obviously can be said for any EV charger but it still applies here, more so with the fact that the screen based advertising that Volta offers hasn't been patented yet. The application is still pending. This could lead to potential clones of this model by competitors.\n\n**References :**\n\n\\[1\\] Volta debuts America\u2019s first FREE fast-charging station this Friday\n\n[https://electrek.co/2019/10/08/volta-debuts-americas-first-free-fast-charging-station-this-friday/](https://electrek.co/2019/10/08/volta-debuts-americas-first-free-fast-charging-station-this-friday/)\n\n\\[2\\] 30 states allow kWh pricing, but non-Tesla EV drivers mostly miss benefits\n\n[https://electrek.co/2019/08/12/kwh-pricing-ev-drivers-miss-benefits/](https://electrek.co/2019/08/12/kwh-pricing-ev-drivers-miss-benefits/)\n\n\\[3\\] Investor presentation\n\n[https://www.datocms-assets.com/32330/1612781257-volta-tortoise-ii-investor-presentation-02-08-21.pdf](https://www.datocms-assets.com/32330/1612781257-volta-tortoise-ii-investor-presentation-02-08-21.pdf)\n\n\\[4\\] Volta Welcomes Praveen Mandal as Chief Technology Officer\n\n[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191105005450/en/Volta-Welcomes-Praveen-Mandal-as-Chief-Technology-Officer](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191105005450/en/Volta-Welcomes-Praveen-Mandal-as-Chief-Technology-Officer)\n\n**Past DDs :**\n\nDD #1 DMYD :\n\n[DMYD : Own the Big Data Provider that Powers DraftKings and Fanduel](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/k449gf/dmyd_own_the_big_data_provider_that_powers/?sort=confidence)\n\nDD #2 LGVW :\n\n[Bill gates backed play : Butterfly and LGVW](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jz0i2d/bill_gates_backed_play_butterfly_and_lgvw/)\n\n\\--------------------------------------\n\nCredit to [the International Spac Station](https://twitter.com/IntlSpacStation) discord and u/robe-'s great DD [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/lfjtod/snpr_volta_merger_dd/)\n\n**Positions : 2150 commons.**\n\nI am not a financial advisor, as a shareholder I may hold a bias towards this stock do your own DD before considering the stock.\n\n\\--------------------------------------\n\n**TLDR : Volta provides a different take upon the charging space, through it's use of advertising and data collection that allows it to have multiple streams of revenue.

        "selftext": "**Positions: FTOC shares, average price $13.24. Not financial advice.**\n\n**What is FTOC/Payoneer?**\n\nFtac Olympus Acquisition Corp (FTOC) is a SPAC led by Betsy Cohen that has a definitive agreement to merge with Payoneer.\n\nPayoneer is a payment platform that offers a way for businesses to pay and receive money, for a low fee. Payoneer believes that the total addressable market (defined as global e-commerce volume) is $26 trillion a year. Payoneer processed over $44 billion in 2020 alone.\n\nPayoneer also offers:\n\n* Accounting integrations\n* Capital to small businesses\n* Regulatory and compliance infrastructure\n* Physical debit cards\n* Tax solutions\n\n**Management Team**\n\nScott Galit - CEO of Payoneer, previously a senior VP at MasterCard. Serious financial services pedigree.\n\nMichael G Levine - CFO of Payoneer, ex-City VP and ex-CFO of Maler Technologies. MBA from Wharton.\n\nBetsy Cohen - CEO of FTOC. Tons of finance related experience, including founding Bancorp. Should be able to give Payoneer great advice for future growth.\n\n**Customers**\n\nPayoneer has some big name clients, including but not limited to:\n\n* Amazon Europe\n* Google\n* eBay\n* Walmart\n* Upwork\n* Fiverr\n\nPayoneer works with 9 of the top 20 most valuable companies. Alongside these big names, Payoneer also has 5 million+ marketplaces and businesses, across over 190 countries.\n\n**Switching Costs**\n\nIntegrating, setting up, and teaching staff how to use a new payment platform can be time-consuming and expensive for businesses. Therefore, when a client is set up on Payoneer, it is unlikely that they will switch to another provider. This is best seen by the &gt;100% volume retention that Payoneer has (i.e. customers stay and increase their payment volume).\n\n**Brand**\n\nPayoneer, from what I have seen, has a strong brand (though this is obviously a subjective factor). This idea is reinforced by the presence of their big name clients. Branding is really important in FinTech, businesses need 100% confidence when money and payments are involved. This offers not only stops entrants into their market, but should also facilitate future growth and customer acquisition.\n\n**Network Effect**\n\nImagine company A is on Payoneer and wants to pay company B. Company A suggests payment through their usual payment processor, Payoneer. Company B now signs up to Payoneer and decides to do all their payments through it etc. This is the network effect that Payoneer enjoys. This is a very powerful barrier to entry - very difficult to overcome, while also hard to create yourself.\n\n**Geographies**\n\nUNSUBSTANTIATED: Conversations on Reddit leads me to believe that Payoneer has a strong presence in Asia. If anyone has evidence, please put it in the comments.\n\nIf this is true, it should give Payoneer an edge in capitalising on the future growth of the emerging markets.\n\nSome evidence:\n\n* The CEO has gone on record saying Korea is one of their big market focuses.\n* Achieved triple digit growth each year in the asian markets from 2012-2016.\n\n**Valuation and Financials**\n\nAll numbers are based on original deal multiples (i.e based on when FTOC was $10 a share).\n\nEnterprise Value: $3.27 billion\n\nProjected 2021 revenue: $432 million\n\nEV/2021 revenue multiple: 7.6x\n\n2019-2020 revenue growth: 8.8%\n\nThis revenue growth is admittedly lower than one would desire for a FinTech company, and is often a criticism leveled against FTOC. However, considering the low EV/Revenue multiple (7.6x) compared to payment processing industry peers (36.5x), means the valuation more than compensates. Another FinTech going public through a SPAC, PaySafe, actually reported a 0.8% decrease in revenues from 2019-2020, but it recently hit $18 a share. (Nothing against PaySafe at all). Moreover, Payoneer\u2019s payment volume increased by 51% in the same timeframe, which will surely result in higher revenues in time. This should mean they reach their long-term target of yearly 20% revenue growth.\n\n**Institutional Ownership**\n\nPayoneer has some institutional giants already invested, including Wellington Management, Dragoneer Investment Group, Fidelity Management and Research, Temasek, and Franklin Templeton.\n\n**Speculative Catalyst**\n\nIn ARK\u2019s Big Ideas 2021, FinTech was mentioned as a big theme that will prevail in 2021. If ARK were to add this cheap, promising FinTech firm to one of their funds, Payoneer will get the respect it deserves and will rocket upwards.\n\n**Risks**\n\n* There are many entrants in the payment processing industry, potentially driving down fees and increasing competition for customers\n* Revenue did not increase very much during 2020, despite a huge e-commerce boom\n* Big clients (which could be a large percentage of revenues) may drop Payoneer for some (hypothetical) reason\n\n**Personal Note**\n\nI use Payoneer as a contractor for Appen. I like it, it always has good customer service, quick payouts and low fees compared to other providers.\n\n**Price Target**\n\nBull Case: $26\n\nMain Case: $21\n\nBear Case: $16\n\nHow did I get these numbers? Just educated guesses.\n\nAs always DYOR, I have linked the investor presentation in the sources, 100% worth a read.\n\n**Sources:**\n\nPosting sources that have been posted before gets this post taken down, so unfortunately I can't add them. If anyone wants them, send me a DM and I will reply with them (but bear in mind I live in the UK regarding time zones).\n\nEdit: Added risks, completely forgot about them (sorry).",

        "selftext": "Previously, I've made my case for Fiverr, a company for freelancers, only last week. Since my recommendation, the stock has grown from 270 to 320 as time of writing. That's an \\~20% increase. I believe the future of work will also be 'online' as opposed to traditional 'in office'. The last year, the coronavirus has only accelerated the shift to online-work.\n\nI now propose another stock, PayPal. What's my reasoning for this?  When you look at growth stocks, you also look at their suppliers.  For Tesla, for example, you look at who's supplying the batteries for electric cars and can bet on that as well.   The rise of Tesla and electric cars has created a halo effect, and the rise in their stocks for all of the industry.  \n\nNow, when you think of Fiverr, and the rise of companies based on online work, payment processing companies will benefit.  When you transact with freelancers half way across the world, we are looking at payment processing companies that serve as a method of  payment for your transaction.  The likes of Visa, Mastercard, and Paypal stand to benefit. Why specifically PayPal? \n\nBasically not only will PayPal stand to benefit from increased transactions as outlined above,  Paypal also looking to get into anything related to digital payments.  To quote,  PayPal has jumped into the mobile payments space with Venmo, which is now the most widely used mobile peer-to-peer payments app out there.  PayPal has also delved into cryptocurrencies, and now accepts cryptos on its payment platform. What\u2019s more, the payments company is also jumping into more direct shopping and stock trading. \n\nBasically, it\u2019s doing it all.  PayPal is turning into an all-in-one digital wallet for consumers. They are looking at doubling it's user-base and hence revenues.  It's parallel is Alibaba's Ant Financial. It's massive in China, and before the Chinese government clamped down on the IPO, it was looking to the biggest IPO in all history.\n\nIf you are looking to place a blue-chip stock in your portfolio, I believe Paypal will the next best bet.",

        "selftext": "Listen up fellow autists, I've been talking with your wife's boyfriends and there is a large play going on behind the scenes with companies like $MC. Listen up and listen good. I know reading and comprehension is a challenge on this sub but I believe in [some of] you. TLDR at the bottom for the true apes among us.\n\nWhat the f** is $MC doing talking with CleanSpark- a &lt;1billion market cap, relatively small company? A company that is by all intents and purposes in the energy sector. CleanSpark Inc focuses on solving modern energy challenges. They focus on software solutions that provide energy modeling, energy market communications, and energy management solutions. Okay, and what does that have to do with XBT or $MC?\n\nThey own ATL Data Centers, which mines, encrypts, and enables the use of the XBT and other currencies alike. This is HUGE for $MC as just last week they announced a plan to incorporate 'other currencies' into the companies current global business model.\n\nThe company\u2019s XBT mining segment brought in 32% of total revenue last year and is growing RAPIDLY. This XBT segment ALONE brought in 115-150million last year versus the 30 million expected because of the new processing capacity they have for mining -modern problems require modern solutions. CleanSpark reported an extremely strong and unexpected quarter. With quarterly revenue of 2.26 million, an increase of 130% from .98 million for the prior year.\n\nThis is not a pump and dump. This is not a game to be played. Fellow autists, we are on the cusp of an XBT revolution. CleanSpark has earning reports coming up on 2/23. You will see a jump. You will diamond hand it and you will thank me later.\n\nTLDR: CleanSpark (find the ticker yourself) is a hidden stock that has already posted a 130%+ gain from last year from their efforts to be at the forefront of XBT in a global economy ANS they are working with $MC to incorporate XBT, which would make $MC the WORLDS FIRST global financial service business to incorporate XBT into their business plan.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe time is among us. The future is here. Don't let your wife's boyfriend take your tendies again.",

        "selftext": "First attempt at DD here on Reddit, 10 month investor here, Mostly Chart Guy. Any input appreciated. This is long, if you get through it you\u2019re a champ. If you invest with me your a champ and a monkey.\n\n**Invivo Therapeutics Holdings Corp DD: Ticker NVIV**\n\nWebsite: [https://www.invivotherapeutics.com/](https://www.invivotherapeutics.com/)\n\nYahoo Finance: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVIV/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVIV/)\n\nRecently I noticed this stock NVIV and started taking a liking to it. They have recently gained attention. Increases in volume, compliance and we are uptrending to tendietown.\n\nInVivo is focused on redefining the treatment of spinal cord injury.\n\nThey plan to facilitate cell survival and growth, to change the treatment of spinal cord injury. Steadily advanced they're scaffold technology through years of research and development with proven clinical data.\n\n**Technical Analysis &amp; Charts:**\n\n**Daily Candies:** I always start with the daily chart since I'm a swing trader by nature. It's very easy to get caught up in short term analysis when IMO the Daily chart is usually the most accurate for a swing trade but of course it's good to check multiple candle stick lengths out and make your own decision. Also you see that orange line (50 day MA) (MA is moving average ) running hard upwards to the blue line? (200 MA). This is what we like to call the golden cross, it's VERY bullish. Also RSI looks nice at 46, definitely on the oversold side.\n\n\\[Imgur\\]([https://imgur.com/3bkb8Hq](https://imgur.com/3bkb8Hq))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4 Hr Candies:** Next I also added a 4hr chart to give a better overview of the mid term price action. You can see my support and resistance lines. It broke through our first major support which is a bummer but bounced nicely off the second support. This was very common in almost all stocks recently simply because the market scare and large correction. (aka the red days we had recently, they were bleeding hard) We have even better RSI here (@ 43) and MACD IS RIGHT ABOUT TO CROSS, this is very important here. It loves to run after that MACD crosses. One of my favorite parts about this set up along with the daily golden cross.\n\n\\[Imgur\\]([https://imgur.com/tSljebi](https://imgur.com/tSljebi))\n\n**15 Min Candies:** Here we have my last chart with 15 minute candlesticks. I drew out our current trendline since the recent dip. Firstly you can see our two support lines. We have a great support right around 1.10$ (dark blue line). This is lovely because it holds us above the 1$ nasdaq compliance line a bit better. I can see this rallying pretty hard past the 1.50 resistance ( which is our other support as well (light blue line) ) pretty easily tomorrow or Friday as its done many times recently. If we break 1.50$ again im very bullish on this to 2$ and hopefully more!\n\n\\[Imgur\\]([https://imgur.com/2fk1Xd9](https://imgur.com/2fk1Xd9))\n\nSome points to note.\n\n* We just  recently received a letter from nasdaq that CO has regained compliance with minimum bid price requirement.

Mr. Christopher holds an M.S. in accounting from Suffolk University and a B.S. in finance from Bentley University.\n\nFDA Info Table:\n\nDrug\n\nStage\n\nNotes\n\nNeuro-Spinal Scaffold: INSPIRE 2.0\n\n*Complete Thoracic AIS A Spinal Cord Injury*\n\nPhase 3\n\nPivotal trial enrollment commenced May 2019. Already noted five patients enrolled as of October 22, 2019. Probably more by now.\n\nNVIV is currently in phase 3 which puts them relatively far along in the FDA approval process.  Below is an outline of the FDA process steps if you are unfamiliar:\n\n## Drug Review Steps Simplified\n\n1. Preclinical (animal) testing.\n2. An investigational new drug application (IND) outlines what the sponsor of a new drug proposes for human testing in clinical trials.\n3. Phase 1 studies (typically involve 20 to 80 people).\n4. Phase 2 studies (typically involve a few dozen to about 300 people).\n5. Phase 3 studies (typically involve several hundred to about 3,000 people).\n6. The pre-NDA period, just before a new drug application (NDA) is submitted. A common time for the FDA and drug sponsors to meet.\n7. Submission of an NDA is the formal step asking the FDA to consider a drug for marketing approval.\n8. After an NDA is received, the FDA has 60 days to decide whether to file it so it can be reviewed.\n9. If the FDA files the NDA, an FDA review team is assigned to evaluate the sponsor's research on the drug's safety and effectiveness.\n10. The FDA reviews information that goes on a drug's professional labeling (information on how to use the drug).\n11. The FDA inspects the facilities where the drug will be manufactured as part of the approval process.\n12. FDA reviewers will approve the application or issue a complete response letter.\n\nIn the end I see this stock doing pretty well in the near short term. Id like to hit a PT of around 2$, but 2.25 would be ideal . My average is 1.39 currently, I have 9k shares. Will continue to slap the ask this next week. Planning to hold for another 2 weeks or so. Wish me luck.\n\nThis is not financial advice.",

        "selftext": "**(Reuters) - Mastercard Inc** said on Wednesday it was planning to offer support for some cryptocurrencies on its network this year, joining a string of big-ticket firms that have pledged similar support.\n\nThe credit-card giant\u2019s announcement comes days after Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla Inc revealed it had purchased $1.5 billion of bitcoin and would soon accept it as a form of payment.\n\nAsset manager BlackRock Inc and payments companies Square and PayPal have also recently backed cryptocurrencies.\n\nMastercard already offers customers cards that allow people to transact using their cryptocurrencies, although without going through its network.\n\n\"Doing this work will create a lot more possibilities for shoppers and merchants, allowing them to transact in an entirely new form of payment. This change may open merchants up to new customers who are already flocking to digital assets,\" Mastercard said.\n\nMastercard specified that not all cryptocurrencies will be supported on its network, adding that many of the hundreds of digital assets in circulation still need to tighten their compliance measures.\n\nMany cryptocurrencies have struggled to win the trust of mainstream investors and the general public due to their speculative nature and potential for money laundering.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currency-mastercard/mastercard-to-open-up-network-to-select-cryptocurrencies-idUSKBN2AA2WF?il=0](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currency-mastercard/mastercard-to-open-up-network-to-select-cryptocurrencies-idUSKBN2AA2WF?il=0)",

        "selftext": "This analysis looks at one possible break-up scenario of the Rite Aid corporation that projects a return of more than 2.5X the closing share price of $19.58 on Friday, February 26, 2021.\n\nRite Aid (RAD) consists of two (2) parts:\n\n1. The Retail Pharmacy business currently generating approximately $16 billion in annual revenues.\n2. The Prescription Benefits Management (PBM) services business known as ELIXIR, currently generating approximately $8 billion in annual revenues.\n\nOne possible scenario for unlocking the value of RAD involves the sale of the Retail Pharmacy business and Rite Aid brand.  What is left is the ELIXIR PBM organization.  Here is an estimation of how such an approach might play out:\n\n* In 2018, Walgreens acquired 1,923 Rite Aid stores for $4.4 billion in cash.  That represents an average price of $2.275 million per store.\n* Should RAD seek a buyer for its Retail Pharmacy business, it could sell its 2,450 remaining stores as well as the Rite Aid brand.  Despite the fact that many of these stores are located in highly attractive locations (CA, OH, MA, MD, NJ, NY, PA, VA, etc), let's discount the average value of each store by 20% (compared to the average price-per-store paid by Walgreens), and arrive at a relatively conservative estimate of $1.8 million per store.\n* At a average price of $1.8 million per store, RAD could reasonably generate proceeds of $4.4 billion with the sale of the entire Retail Pharmacy business, including the 2,450 locations and the Rite Aid brand name (assigning no good will value to the brand).\n* The remaining RAD organization essentially consists of a PBM branded as ELIXIR and a net amount of cash on hand of +$1.2 billion, assuming that $3.2 billion of the Retail Pharmacy sale proceeds are used to pay down the entire existing long-term debt on the company's books.\n* ELIXIR's projected sales for RAD's fiscal year 2021 (ending February 2021) are approximately $8 billion.  During each of the past four (4) quarters, RAD has reported ELIXIR's year-over-year growth rate to be in the range of  23 - 29%.\n* ELIXIR's projected EBITDA for fiscal 2022 (begining March of 2021) will likely be approximately $200 million.  Once again, I am taking a conservative estimate, and basically considering that a business that has grown 23 - 29% each quarter for the past year, will suddenly see little to no growth in the upcoming year.\n* With only 55,000,000 shares outstanding today, the $200 million EBITDA generated by ELIXIR translates to roughly $3.60 per share in earnings.  Using a highly conservative PE multiple of 8, a stock price of $28.80 results.   However, the cash-on-hand of $1.2 billion (from the sale of the Retail Pharmacy business after long-term debt payoff) produces additional value of $22.00 per share, resulted in a stock price value of more than $50 per share (which is more than 2.5X the closing price of $19.58 on Friday, February 26, 2021).\n* The newly created company, ELIXIR, would be well-positioned for growth in the small-to-mid-size opportunity segment of the $400 billion per year PBM industry.  With a net $1.2 billion in cash, that future growth could be achieved both organically as well as through acquisition.\n\nIn conclusion, this analysis indicates that the conservative value of RAD today is $50 per share, well above the current share price being attributed to the organization by the market, which is just under $20.\n\nThe purpose of this post is not to suggest that a breakup of the Rite Aid corporation is the best strategic path forward.  (I personally believe that the company has the potential to generate a price per share north of $100 in the next 12 - 24 months if it keeps the entire organization fully in tact.)  Rather, the purpose of the post was to reveal the hidden value locked within RAD that is clearly being overlooked by the investment community, by analyzing one possible break-up scenario.",

        "selftext": "Short DD, feel free to comment.\n\nTailwinds:\n\n\\- Commodity vs gold ratio has started to crunch down signaling commodity boom (copper, lumber, tin, oil, NG, even uranium). Silver, though considered a partial monetary metal, is only going to see increased demand from batteries, solar, EV, medical equipment from here on out. I believe one Tesla Roadster uses something like 1-3 kg of silver. Historical average gold to silver ratio is 40. We are at 66 ish. Mining ratio is 8:1, even lower.\n\n\\- Natural elasticity built up from COMEX futures suppression. This is a long topic in itself, but the silver price along with gold price has been \"managed\" for years, with banks like JPM being fined millions of dollars for spoofing (creating massive sells using paper futures triggering cascade of sell stops during thin volume trading hours). However as supply becomes tighter the COMEX is increasingly being used as a method for private family offices, mints, industrials, and hedgefunds to take delivery. The situation is quite dire IMO after the recent \"silversqueeze\" movement- Currently there are about 700 million ounces worth of open contract, with 4 days until March delivery. This number is historically high, and even a small percentage of these contracts standing for delivery (i.e by mints and ETF etc who are feeling the demand) would lead to price volatility.\n\n\\- Monetary metal. Due to its extreme utility it can be considered the Etherium or theta to gold, but it is nevertheless still store of value, even though it is not a tier I asset for central banks yet. While gold experiences short term head wind due to rising bond yields, a FED yield curve control policy would dramatically increase tail winds for gold. If history serves, gold and silver have a deep connection and a true commodities bull market is often marked by high gold prices. \n\n\\- Unlike gold, silver has no direct competitor, perceived or actual. Graphene technology is many years away as is space mining. \n\nHeadwinds:\n\n\\- Disbelief. Really this is the only head wind I see. Silver has all the properties of gold, and all the utility of something like copper, along with the right price for a value play. If you believe in commodities and inflation, silver to me is a no brainer. That does not mean people won't state its track record as a negative, I realize this. However I rather be in something that has been stagnant for 20 years with all the right fundamentals than something that has been hot for only one month with no fundamentals.\n\nVolcanoes and earthquakes happen, and the longer you go without one the higher the odds of it happening.\n\nShort term outlook:\n\n\\- As mentioned the COMEX March contract situation is a developing story. Shorts closing out positions in fear of being asked to deliver will drive up prices. If this happens we can expect 30 dollars in short order.\n\n\\- Technical wise, this is bullish with any method you chose to use. It is far above its 200 day MA, unlike gold. It has been making higher lows since December and hasn't neared its Sept low yet. Alot of upwards pressure esp recently, mixed with the aforementioned price smashes.\n\nThe plays:\n\n\\-There are no physical silver available any where in the world to retail at spot price. That being said physical silver is something I would consider investing in as an adjunct to gold or bitcoin for store of value.\n\n\\-PSLV. Sprott physical silver trust. Really as far as ETF's go I'd say this is the safest. Recent changes to SLV prospectus makes one weary about actual physical availability. PSLV trades at a slight premium to spot, however if one was to accumulate 10K ounces worth (\\~34K USD at current price) delivery is an option. \n\n\\-Miners. More leverage, more volatility, potential jurisdiction risk. PAAS and AG are larger players. I am deep into many miners. Can discuss if you want. \n\n\\-SLV calls. Again this is for position/swing trading. If you want to invest in SLV as a store of value, I personally wouldn't. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot investment advice. Happy to discuss. \n\nDisclosure: I invest in many silver (and uranium) stocks, and am founder of pmstonks subreddit.",

        "selftext": "Hey there. So, i'm looking for some advice guys or guidelines on the direction of where to look. I'm quite new to investing, my first shares being bought in january 2020 (it was apple) and we all know what happened starting january/february . In no time, the portfolio was something like -60% :)). I knew very few things but i knew not to panic sell and just ride with it, and it turned out to be a great decision. Now, since then, i've constantly made small purchases every know and then (regardless of how the market was doing) and here is how my portfolio is divided (i started investing knowing that i don't need this money in the near future, so i wanna do mostly, if not all, just buy and hold for as long as i can, big/stable companies. I don't wanna try to time the market or day trade (not that i even know how that works lol) ). Here it is:\n\n**23%** \\- Nvidia    **22%** \\- Apple     **14%** \\- Google     **9.2%** \\- Mastercard     **6.7%** \\- Amazon     **6.6%** \\- Microsoft     **6.4%** \\- NextEra Energy     **4.7%** \\- Tesla     **4.4%** \\- Visa     **3.5%** \\- Boeing\n\nHad pretty good returns on everything so far (best ones on Nvidia and Apple) so although these days were rough, everything it's still in green so i'm pretty happy with that, BUT, i see everything now as a good opportunity to buy at \"sale prices\". But rather than buying more of the stocks i have, i feel like i wanna use this opportunity to diversify the portfolio a little bit (i feel like it's too much towards the tech; by all means correct me if it's not the case here). I kept looking at Coca Cola and Disney (i see this keep going up especially in the coming years, in the idea of everything coming back to normal) for some time now, but i don't know if i should get them or not. Now my question is: If YOU would have this portfolio, what would you buy to diversify it (i don't know, maybe more towards health-care, more consumer , etc) . ANY advice is more than welcome, as i said, i'm pretty new to this, although i think i know a thing or two. Thank you in advance and enjoy the sale i guess :)",

Usually funds arrive within 1-2 business days.\n* Vendors can also pay suppliers directly through wire transfers and pay for services like hosting using the MasterCard. *However, customers can't fund their Payoneer account.* While Payoneer likes the reputation of being \"a U.S bank account\" they really are not. They are a service that allows you to receive payment from companies. While individuals can send money from and to other Payoneer accounts, wire transfers to the account can only be done by a business. \n* As a result of the Wirecard scandal, Payoneer now gives the users the option to choose to hold their funds on their MasterCard or on Payoneer own accounts. \n* From [u/-Jack-The-Lad](https://www.reddit.com/user/-Jack-The-Lad-/): \u201cOverall I think Payoneer is a good company. They have a lot of room for expansion and their market is beyond huge. One thing I am concerned about is the potential for increased regulatory scrutiny. As Payoneer grows, it will likely get noticed by countries and may face stricter regulations both from the U.S and abroad.\u201d \n\n2. **Customer service.** After spending some time on the r/Payoneer sub-reddit, I have a few initial impressions. \n\n* While the Wirecard scandal caused a headache for Payoneer\u2019s customers, it seems to be a transitory issue.  \n* The Wirecard scandal aside, Payoneer\u2019s customer service is less than perfect and needs to improve. (Note: few people go out of their way to praise a bank or their cable company for seamlessly delivering the services the customers pay for. Please keep that in mind when browsing r/Payoneer.)\n\n3. **Valuation.** A number of people are comparing Payoneer\u2019s multiple to those of PayPal and Shopify. While these are the right comps, Payoneer's multiple will be determined by its customer lifetime value (CLTV), which is an NPV of the total cash flows from each customer over his/her/its lifetime. (While technically FinTech companies are valued on revenue or earnings/EBITDA its CLTV which will determine the valuation multiple.) There's a reason why the company included different cohort growth rates and mentioned a less than 12-month customer payback in the presentation. These are the metrics that matter.\n\nAdditionally, many are looking at Payoneer\u2019s transaction fees to get a sense for the potential revenue opportunity. While this is logical it is somewhat misleading because these services are considered low quality revenue (cf. the race to sub-1% fees in China). Similar to the CDN business, where moving traffic is a commodity while providing web acceleration and cloud security offer higher margins, Payoneer needs to upsell higher value added service to its customer base initially attracted by low service fees. Once agin, Payoneer highlighted these value added services in its presentation\n\nTLDR: Based on first hand feedback, Payoneer proves a very needed service. While the Wirecard scandal and fallout seem to be transitory, Payoneer\u2019s customer service needs to continue to improve. Fortunately, like cable, FinTech customers seem willing to tolerate a certain degree of frustration.  \n\nI definitely believe Payoneer has potential as a long-term buy and hold and is also a likely take-out candidate. While the global B2B industry is fragmented, Payoneer is playing the long-game by transitioning from commodity service fees to high-touch and sticky value add services. The key metric analysts will focus on is CLTV which will benefit from the shift to these services. Moreover, Payoneer\u2019s valuation multiple should reflect this transition by increasing (or \u201cexpanding\u201d in WS parlance) as Payoneer executes on this strategy. \n\n**Disclosure &amp; Disclaimer**\n\nI am not a financial advisor. Please do your own due diligence.\n\nI have the following positions:\n\n1. 1,000 FTOC common shares\n2. 10 February/August Covered      Calls @ $12.50 (short)/$17.50 (long). I intend to write monthly calls      against the long option, which is known as a diagonal spread or poor man's      covered call (PMCC). If anyone has insight into the attractiveness of the      warrants, I would appreciate his/her perspective.",

        "selftext": "So I stumbled upon TRMB as one typically does: analyzing Cathie Wood's holdings in ARKQ. I had never heard of the company nor seen the stock mentioned anywhere, but, given TRMB is the #4 holding in ARKQ, I decided to check them out. \n\nFirst of all, who the hell even are these people: \n\nTrimble Inc. is basically a hardware and software provider, focusing on managment and organization systems. \n\nThat may be jibberish to you, but basically the company is broken into 4 segments:\n\n1. Buildings and Infrastructure, which focuses on serving architects, contractors, owners, and operators by providing software for route selection and design; systems to guide and control construction equipment; systems to monitor, track, and manage assets, equipment, and workers; software to share and communicate data; 3D conceptual design and modeling software; building information modeling software; integrated site layout and measurement systems; cost estimating, scheduling, and project controls solutions; applications for sub-contractors and trades; and an integrated workplace management software.\n2. Geospatial, which provides surveying and geospatial products, and geographic information systems \n3. Resources and Utilities, which offers precision agriculture products and services, such as guidance and positioning systems, automated and variable-rate application and technology systems, and information management solutions. It offers manual and automated navigation guidance for tractors and other farm equipment; solutions to automate the application of pesticide and seeding; water solutions; Farmer Core, a software subscription that enables farmers to connect their farm operation; and forestry solutions for forest management and timber processing\n4. The transportation segment offers solutions for long haul trucking, field service management, rail, and construction logistics industries; and transportation management, analytics, routing, mapping, reporting, and predictive modeling solution\n\nPretty cool and important stuff, I think, so I dove into the numbers:\n\n18.4 billion dollar market cap (very comparable with industry peers ZBRA, KEYS, CGNX), PE ratio of 30.1 (compared to the industry average of 26.3), avg volume of 2.05 million, all pretty solid. \n\nOver the past 52 weeks, the stock is up 71.35%, with a 52-week range of 20.01-76.50. The 50-day MA is 70.90. \n\nOf course, I had to look into the company's financials as well. \n\nIn Q4 2020, the company had a total revenue of 829.70 million dollars (up 0.4% year over year), with an operating income of 127.80 million. The company has an operating margin of around 15%, which is above its industry average. Revenue declined from 2019 to 2020 by 200 million dollars, but that is to be expected given the overall decline of the economy last year. Net income grew dramatically from 2018 to 2019, growing from 315.8 million to 547.4 million, and then grew another 16% (87 million) in 2020. \n\nRobert Painter, the CEO, ended their most recent earnings call by saying, \"We enter 2021 with increased conviction in our ability to fulfill our mission to transform the way the world works. Furthermore, I'd also like to take the opportunity to acknowledge Trimble's inclusion in the S&amp;P 500 as of January 21, a milestone for Trimble's growth and global impact\"\n\nThe company has continuously beat consensus estimates in earnings per share, most recently beating an expected 0.51 EPS with 0.61 EPS. Q1 2021 EPS consensus is 0.54. \n\n**Finally, my bull case for the stock:**\n\n* TRMB is an industry leader in agricultural, construction, and trucking telematics.\n* Caterpillar, Hyundai, Paccarr, and more are all using TRMB as their telematics solution on many product lines.\n* TRMB executives believe telematics have only reached about 25-30% of the total addressable market. \n\n**Bear case:**\n\n* The company is known to rapidly acquire other companies, where they risk overpaying. \n\nMaybe this will help you, maybe it won't, I was just interested in the stock so decided to dig around. \n\nDisclosure: I entered a position earlier today with 10 shares @ $74.36",

        "selftext": " **TL;DR Basics:**\n\n* Latin American and Canadian subsidiary of InBev (Bud, Stella). Owns Guaran\u00e1 Antarctica (Brazil's #2 soft drink, after Coke) and Pepsi distribution rights through at least 2027.\n* Rock-solid financials.\n* Trading at a depressed value because of COVID price drop and likely-reversing currency depreciation in Latin America.\n* **Verdict:** This is a penny stock that shouldn't be a penny stock. Stable, long-term market leader with a substantial moat in both the alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages sector. An excellent hedge against the current bubbling market that should still show significant gains due to COVID reopening. Great place to park and protect profits.\n\n**Institutions, Valuation, Financials:**\n\n* Institutional Ownership: 98.27% (Fidelity)\n* Float: 272.2 million (Total\\*0.0173)\n* Short Interest/Days to Cover: 3.0 (MarketBeat)\n* Debt/Equity: 0.03 (Morningstar)\n* Current Ratio: 1.3 (My calcs)\n* Dividend Yield: 3.32% Annual (Fidelity)\n* P/E TTM: 25.55 vs. 46.14 industry avg. (Fidelity)\n* P/B TTM: 3.15 vs. 9.33 industry avg. (Fidelity)\n\n**Macro Upsides: Currency Recovery Play**\n\nIn January, the Real depreciated 33% vs. USD due to COVID risks prompting a flight to safety. A \"flight to safety\" is when USD appreciates vs. everybody and JPY/Euro appreciate to a lesser extent vs. developing world currencies. This put a short-term squeeze on developing world businesses with global supply chains.\n\nWhy? The challenge for developing world businesses is that their ***income*** is derived from local currencies - in this case, Brazilian Real is the main one, but also CAD, Argentine peso, &amp; Chilean peso - but their ***costs*** are primarily derived from US Dollars, because international commodity contracts are denominated in US Dollars. So, if the company wants to buy sugar for soft drinks or barley for beer brewing, they pay in USD. But when they sell, they earn income in real or pesos. Currency pressure therefore puts pressure on profit margins.\n\nGoing forward, emerging market currencies should remain stable or appreciate vs. USD as vaccine rollouts continue; the real economy stabilizes; and institutional risk appetite normalizes. Coupled with Brazil's recent pension reforms and relatively strong financial picture in the banking sector, I find it highly likely the Real has bottomed-out and will appreciate in the intermediate term.\n\nNote: This is my judgment, as someone who taught undergraduate development economic policy courses for a decade. There are competing opinions, which I discuss below and include in the sources.\n\n* Credentials, for those who care: MA International Development 2009 (American University); PhD (ABD) @ UC San Diego).\n\n(An aside: I am curious if folks appreciate this kind of content. If so, **let me know in the comments or PM me** \\- I'm likely starting an economic policy substack to help folks understand the broader picture on regulatory issues and such.)\n\n**Monthly and Weekly Technicals:**\n\nTrading at Long-Term trend support on the monthly chart. Monthly Trend Resistance is around $2.90-3.00.\n\nDaily/Weekly charts have it in the middle of an upward channel trade, but still significantly below 2019 prices. Immediate support levels are at $2.77 and $2.50\n\nMonthly resistance levels: $4.15, $5.15, and $6.00.\n\nMy current target is in the $4.50-$5.50 range.\n\n**Downside risks:**\n\n* Slightly declining market share in Alcoholic beverages sector to Heineken and Cervejara Petropolis. A lot of this due to Heineken's previous acquisition of Kirin, aggressive marketing, and the robust craft beer market in Brazil. This has led to increased marketing costs and a slightly declining operating margin. I consider this the most relevant critique. However, I think it is mitigated by multiple factors.\n   * The most recent filings from AmBev show expanding craft beer portfolio with solid growth in those brands.\n   * AmBev still has a substantial moat at \\~60% market share. Market share erosion is likely to subside given the dominant position.\n   * Pressure from the downturn in the real and COVID will exert disproportionate pressure on smaller businesses. Given AmBev's rock-solid financial position and dominant market presence, this creates excellent brand acquisition opportunities.\n* Potential currency risk from two things:\n   * Vaccine rollouts in South America being undermined by political actors, the most likely being Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil. Given Biden is US president, support from international development institutions, and elite desires to reopen, I find this fairly unlikely.\n   * Currency risks may continue if vaccination proves a challenge or there is a COVID surge. Again, I think fairly unlikely - the dominant likelihood is capital flows returning to emerging markets as vaccination rollouts continue.\n\n**Position:** Long 1300 shares @ $2.85\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am not a financial advisor.

        "selftext": "Hi Everyone,\n\nHope everyone is having a great weekend. I just thought I would do a quick follow up / update to my previous posts on the $SSFT Sonasoft chart and trading for last week and potential for this week.\n\nRecap from last week(s):\n\nFriday Feb 12th: after consolidating on lower volume following run (high vol) from mid-teens, the stock pierced below 7day Moving Avg - but closed above. \n\nMonday Feb 15th: Trading Holiday\n\nTuesday Feb 16: we saw Golden Cross occur (Bullish trend indicator when 50day Moving Avg crosses above 200day MA) and the same day the stock bounced off the 7day MA and gapped up and ran (high volume) from the .23 level (previous close) all the way to the .40 level.\n\nWednesday - Thursday - Friday Feb 19th the stock began consolidating on LOWER volume \\*\\*Very strong trend when stock keeps spiking (accumulation) on high volume and steadying (consolidation) on lower volume. It indicates more buyers are holding long.\\*\\* - On Friday it once again pierced below 7day MA but ultimately closed above.\n\nThe volume is increasing on each accumulation price spike and seems to be following a strong/stable stair step pattern of high accumulation then low consolidation - Very healthy IMO\n\nNow the last 3 major moves were bounces off of the 7day (the original move also involved breaking out above 50MA and 200MA). Also, prior to each of these spikes, the RSI was under 70 by a few points - the RSI is now cooled to 64.42  -  If recent history is to repeat itself, I would anticipate a similar step up in the first half of this coming week - sure is lining up beautifully IMO.\n\n\\*\\*Thoughts on Friday's PR below this chart\\*\\*  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/02uzg2xflvi61.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=279c325fd3fb807c8a870abadd4c8f5e0a533d89\n\nFridays PR: Firstly, I am amazed that it took the Company this long to really be discovered by the market. They have been putting out great pieces of news here and there, and the stock would have brief spikes in volume/price, but then would just trail off again. From what I gather, the Company was FAR more interested in BUILDING an actual business and creating shareholder value through the development new breakthrough AI technology. They've strengthened their competitive edge on a number of front including tech offerings, management/engineering teams, big named partnerships/clients/deals, and more recently patent application. So they were fairly tight lipped the past year or so and as such the investment community was largely unaware of this stock (hidden gem imo)....\n\n...This now seems to have changed in recent months. The Company provided a 2020 Recap PR and trading volumes began increasing (along with price) and both have continued from there. The stock is now trading very high volumes and is attracting a ton of new investors, followers, commenters, youtubers, etc etc. (As can also be shown clearly using the chart summary posted above)\n\nFriday, the Company announced Enhanced IR Initiatives... Based on the primary reason the stock is still so cheap is it is still very much undiscovered, these IR/Communication enhancement can only help drive more eyes, attention, and trading volumes into the stock - perhaps even some institutional / hedge fund buying as the company continues announcing new deals and releasing info on current projects. The more news, message board chatter, and various forms of media coverage = more awareness - and in my opinion, MOST savvy investors would be interested in owning this stock if they take the time to do the DD.\n\nHere is excerpt from the IR Enhancement PR from Friday (emphasis my own):\n\n *Shareholders can expect the following IR initiatives to be implemented by the end of the month:*\n\n*1.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0***Updated IR page:*** *We will be updating the Investors Relations page on our website. The new IR section will include quarterly and annual financial reports, SEC reports, press releases, investor presentations, IR contact information, stock information such as stock quotes, charts, and other resources as they become available. We will also include a sign-up form for investors to receive periodic information via emails such as newsletters, blog posts, updates, and notifications of upcoming events.*\n\n*2.*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0***More frequent corporate communication******s*** *from the Company relating to material events and business developments.*\n\n*3.*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0***Increased media presence*** *and management to make the* ***time for*** ***interviews/articles with various outlets.***\n\n*4.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0The Company intends to begin hosting* ***Quarterly shareholder conference calls*** *later this year.*\n\n*2021 has been off to a great start, and the company continues driving growth and new technologies. Management remains steadfast in its dedication to delivering maximum value to our shareholders and customers alike. We will provide shareholders with regular updates as the Company continues to execute on its business objectives.*\n\nSource link: [https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/SSFT/news/Sonasoft-Announces-Enhanced-Investor-Relations-Initiatives-and-Resources?id=290605](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/SSFT/news/Sonasoft-Announces-Enhanced-Investor-Relations-Initiatives-and-Resources?id=290605)\n\nSo the company has advised there will be increased press releases / communications (bullish), and increased media presence (perhaps more mainstream media sources like radio/television/investment websites?), and Quarterly Conference Calls (so dummies like me can have things explained clearly straight from the horse's mouth).. I've also been made aware that SSFT has an advertisement on the boards in the San Jose Sharks arena (SJ Sharks is one of their clients too!)\n\nSo in summary, based on all stated above (as well as previous DD) I'd say this thing could just be getting started. I definitely view it as extremely undervalued compared to other popular stocks in the OTC - if the volumes and awareness continues growing exponentially as it has been we could be in for a wild ride!\n\n\\*\\*Here is link to my original DD post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ldemtd/sonasoft\\_ssft\\_fully\\_audited\\_ai\\_company\\_with\\_1333m/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ldemtd/sonasoft_ssft_fully_audited_ai_company_with_1333m/)\n\nAll just my thoughts/Opinions. Do yo own damn research! I'm always wrong 187% of the time!!\n\nThank you for reading. All comments, questions, suggested are welcomed and encouraged.\n\nAll the best and Good luck this coming week! $$$$",

        "selftext": "So, TSLA, along w/ the rest of the Tech stocks is on a downward trajectory, which leads to the obvious question: When does it stop so I can buy in and maximize my upside potential?\n\nI took a look at some historical Moving Averages to get an idea of how far this may go and my initial conclusions are below:\n\n1. Crashed through the 50-day SMA on 21 Feb and has stayed &gt;10% below since.  This MA has historically been TSLA's support level and staying below leads me to think it may be here a while.\n2. 100-day SMA is the next logical support level, which is $625 so I'll be watching closely to see if the downward trajectory continues at the same rate, or starts to level out as it approaches that 100-day SMA support level.\n\nThe stock is at $688 now so that 100-day SMA isn't really far off and it could rebound sharply so set your alerts and/or limits, raid your wife's boyfriend's wallet, and hang on for a fun, and potentially lucrative opportunity.

        "selftext": "**My positions:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q2blf3vc0ah61.png?width=444&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ff0e236d10f44b9d4652f2b8d4b02b8e502c39e\n\n**Disclaimer:** If you are a conservative investor you will find reading this a waste of time. Everything you read is highly questionable and accuracy of information is not guaranteed. No financial advice here. I have a significant long position in PSTH. The merger target and date could be incorrect. I\u2019m talking up my book. This is not a research report, just speculation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Thesis: There is two parts to this speculation**\n\nA. PSTH will merge with Stripe. (For these see A-Exhibits)\n\nB. The announcement will come on Feb 17th. (For these see B-Exhibits)\n\n**What is Stripe?** A payment processing company that competes with Square and PayPal. In April 2020, the San Francisco-based company ra ised $600 million from investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital at a valuation of $36 billion. It is currently being valued at $70 billion or more. Stripe was founded by Irish brothers John and Patrick Collison founded Stripe in 2010. I\u2019m very familiar with the Irish, and the duo are extremely smart and have European way of thinking and mannerisms. \n\n**Background:** I presented the speculative evidence for Stripe being the target in A-Exhibits and timing in B-exhibits. A lot of these are scraped from various people who have done lots of digging. A speculative trade like this has high risk but also high reward. Nailing the timing on this would be tickets to retirement for some. So SPACs move massively on any news of discussion with a good target. Stripe is in my opinion as sweet honey. I highly doubt that Ackman and all those big investors like Guggenheim would invest in a SPAC without having a solid short list. I think their short list had Bloomberg and Stripe on it. They flirted with AirBnB and Coinbase just to see their chances. If any of those happened or a new sweet target emerged then they would do a quick second SPAC. They used PSTH to grab attention of other companies and see what they can attract for their future SPACs. Kind of like what Chamat did. I speculate that Stripe was their target and Stripe was just spending time getting ready for the Feb 17th announcement. All this is speculation. I also have read speculations about StarLink and Plaid and those really didn\u2019t hold any water. Collison brothers\u2019 way of running their companies has been very European like. Very cooperative and trusting of the process. They didn\u2019t mind giving a big chunk of their company to Y-combinator. They didn\u2019t mind hiring agitators. They just seem to operate like they live in Ireland and everyone is trustable. They are not used to dealing with NYC sharks. They are easy prey for a top predator like AckFuckingMan.  \n\n**Exhibit A-1: Stripe has been going on a hiring spree. 973 job postings vs last year 260** \n\n[https://stripe.com/jobs/search](https://stripe.com/jobs/search)\n\nBelow is how their site looks now:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u404o2ce0ah61.png?width=722&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8f2b63deb8432098c9ffd7c6f8d5a631276354f\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBelow is how their postings looked in April of 2020\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uwqdv8mf0ah61.png?width=684&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=622ccdaf94f6b5781f2e2e78be103256bf005c79\n\nHiring needs money! They are obviously seeing a huge injection of money coming their way. \n\n**Exhibit A-2: Privacy statement of Stripe updated** \n\nNew text added regarding \u201cother entity which buys us\u201d to their privacy statement. \n\nBelow is the privacy statement once updated:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ehnhm8jg0ah61.png?width=668&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3244068df641543e55fece6bd0306acc1e16c8ff\n\nBelow is how it looked in early 2020: (see it is missing that sentence)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kunyeoch0ah61.png?width=686&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8be19b5bf85f9e8b3614ab59f3dbddff23863084\n\n**Exhibit A-3: Bill Ackman follows 190 people on twitter and oddly 3 are stripe et al**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9x0tz0gi0ah61.png?width=658&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2678e3b0aeaedc4ee60b22533fcd3067ad2067c9\n\n**Exhibit A-4: Ackman mentioned that he talked to stripe** \n\n[https://youtu.be/GmaCarSyBk4?t=917](https://youtu.be/GmaCarSyBk4?t=917)   Minute 15:17\n\nStripe wasn\u2019t ready to go public but they sure seem to be working towards it. Bill mentions \u201cManagement\u201d, \u201cInfrastructure\u201d, and \u201csystems\u201d. So that ties into exhibit A-1.

Jackie was the head of capital for square and stepped down. She has also been liking tweets from Ackman. \n\n**Exhibit A-10: Peter Collison interacted with posts about SPAC on Twitter.** \n\nThose were on Jan 8th. They have been deleted since. I could be wrong about this exhibit.\n\n=====================================================================\n\n**Exhibit B-1: Bill Ackman earnings call: Ackman gave a 2021 Q1 target**\n\n[https://centurylink.cwebcast.com/ses/2CUtOMyHmr7q63DSO2LpyA\\~\\~?ek=0fb7e9e1-3910-4dd3-a749-24f81df281ad](https://centurylink.cwebcast.com/ses/2CUtOMyHmr7q63DSO2LpyA~~?ek=0fb7e9e1-3910-4dd3-a749-24f81df281ad)\n\nMin 42:30\n\n*\u201cIn terms of timing, what we said at the time of the IPO is we said it would take us, we thought about six months to identify a target that we would be in a position to hopefully announce a deal by sometime in Q1 and then close the transaction in the ordinary course thereafter. Nothing that we have experienced to-date suggests that we won\u2019t meet our expected timeframe\u201d-* \n\n**Exhibit B-2: The two meetings are right one after another. Seems to be coordinated.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img dqict6sq0ah61...*\n\n**Exhibit B-3: Note the bump in price and volume earlier this week**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8kc91bnr0ah61.png?width=645&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4bf1186fb68589b1a38dbccbb91f46d7a0b537dd\n\nThis points to some insiders getting ready for the announcement. \n\n**Exhibit B-4: IV on the call options suggest big imminent news**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/160of5js0ah61.png?width=630&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94de0ac8eac7bbd6b0f281321ee5fb4f432ad818\n\nThis was captured before news of 13G filed on Friday. \n\n**Exhibit B-5: Twitter activity**\n\nOn Feb 8th Bill tweeted a Rap Song about SPACs: [https://twitter.com/BillAckman/status/1358799402371076096](https://twitter.com/BillAckman/status/1358799402371076096)\n\nBill is not too active on twitter, nor is John Collison.\n\nPatrick and John Collison both had a notable reduction in twitter activity in first week of Feb and all of a sudden they came alive on Feb 8th. This is the day that PSTH shares jumped \\~6% on no news. Insiders buying? There was a lot of unexplained excitement on that day both in twitter behaviour of parties involved and price of PSTH. \n\n**Exhibit B-6: 13G filing by PSH**\n\nNews of raising more money coming out just now! See 13G filled on **2/12/21** after hours. \n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336528/000119312521041777/d105691dsc13g.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336528/000119312521041777/d105691dsc13g.htm) \n\nI think there is a lot of confusion about this. People are saying that it is PSH increasing the PIPE, and this is pointing to a bigger deal. I think this is false. I think for that you need an S-3 filing. This is obviously above my paygrade and we need a securities lawyer to decipher this for us. What is noteworthy is that this simple news made **the stock move 10% and warrants move 25%.** So you see any small hints of positive news make this baby move massively.  \n\n**=================================================================================**\n\n**Notable Institutional Investors:**\n\nPERSHING SQUARE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, L.P.  200,000,100 $5,544,002,772\n\nGUGGENHEIM CAPITAL LLC    22,000,000 $499,180,000\n\nBAUPOST GROUP LLC     12,707,924 $352,264,000\n\nCITADEL ADVISORS LLC     2,167,041 $49,170,000\n\nPEAK6 INVESTMENTS LLC **(CALL)**    577,400 $16,006,000 **(New Position)**\n\nGOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC    299,498 $8,302,000 **(New Position)**\n\nIt is speculated by redditors that the prominent wealthy investor that Bill Ackman was talking about is either Warren B, Bill G, or the Warlton family. I think this doesn\u2019t matter since there is enough institutional and big money interest in this that money is not an issue. A celebrity name like Bill Gates or Warren B would be nice.",

        "selftext": "TLDR: I think American Cannabis could be the next hypetrain after short squeeze euphoria. (Which is the sequal to EV euphoria). Buy MSOS. If you want concentration, check out MSOS holdings. I personnally like Cresco. \n\nDo you guys like the color green? Well I do, because it's the color of money, and it's the color of what can potentially make us all ALOT of money. Cannabis. Not just any Cannabis. United States Multi-state Operators [MSO's]. I'm sure all of you have heard of the CGC's, the TLRY's, and the ACB's. Well I'll tell you right now, those are all dogshit in comparison to the US MSO's. None of the Canadian cannabis names are cashflow positive and they reek of overvaluation. In this post, I will focus on the big dog CGC, which is somehow trading at a 20x Enterprise value to Sales multiple. That's higher than the software industry, which is on average ~15x.\n\nI'm sure a lot of growth in the US is priced into the Canadian names, but they barely have ANY sales in the US. It's ridiculous. Even the Canadian Chiefs and Top Dogs realize the money is in the US, as they are using their extreme overvaluation to bully and try to acquire some of the US names. CGC, specifically, is targeting Terrascend, who has a large New Jersey market share. (Side note, New Jersey just legalized recreational Cannabis). The reason the Canadians are trying to add exposure in the US market is very simple. Total Addressable Market [TAM]. The Canadian TAM is 25 Billion. The US TAM is double that, 50 Billion. WITHOUT FEDERAL LEGALIZATION! If it were to be legalized federally, TAM should go parabolic. The Canadians know where the real money is to be made.\n\nThat leads me into my next point, TAM and valuation. CGC, specifically, has increased revenue 50% from last year, but their operating income is at double the LOSS from last year, while the expenses have also increased 50%. The US MSO names are growing operating profits exponentially. Cresco is one name that has picked up steam. They own the Illinois, Ohio, and Pennsylvania markets, essentially, but they also have a market share in NV, AZ, MA, CA and NY. (NY recently mentioned potentially legalizing recreation cannabis). They recently expanded into Florida through the acquisition of Bluma Wellness. Most of these US MSO's are looking at doubling their operating profits from last year, and they are even hindered because their share offerings must be done in Canada, which puts them at a huge disadvantage when raising equity. Additionally, these MSO's are currently trading at a 5x EV/Sales ratio, which is a huge discount compared to the Canadians. If it were valued similar to CGC, it could multiply by 15 from it's current price. MSOS is an ETF that includes the big US MSO's and some others. As the ETF gains value, the shares gain value and vice versa; they are symbiotic.\n\nMy opinion is that this is free, but you need to be patient. The US MSO's will eventually find similar value (x15) to the Canadians while the Canadians take a shit in stock price. (It's just a matter of when.) The main catalysts that I am on the lookout for are the passing of either MORE or SAFE. With the US Senate flipping blue with Kamala being the tie breaker, it's VERY likely that one of those will be passed this year. Democrats skew towards the legalization of Cannabis, but currently, covid is taking priority over other legistature. MORE and SAFE have both passed the house, now it's just up to when the Senate decides to put it up for a vote. If MORE or SAFE are passed, then the US MSO's can list on US Exchanges (like NYSE), and you guessed it, that will cause an exponential and euphoric increase in the share prices. A lot of institutes and funds cannot buy the MSO's right now, which may have caused them to take position in either MSOS or Canadian names. Once these the US MSO's can list on the US exchanges, the institutes and funds will crowd into big four names, which will cause MSOS to explode, which will also endorse more buying in US MSO names. It'll be a snowball effect. (Not to mention how options will also be available for them, which also can help that \"snowball\" keep rolling.)\n\nNow I realize there's a lot of hype in meme stocks. After the hype for those have died down, remember this post. Save it even. This will be the next hype train. My prediction, is that MORE/SAFE is passed within 3-6 months, probably after more covid vaccines rollout and we get closer to herd immunity. Then from there, by Dec, US MSO's will nearly x4.",

        "selftext": "## Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this post is to write out the thought process and analysis of some of my major investments. Each of these investments can take over a year to decide on, but cannot be invested in until I have written out the process.\n\nPart of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation to open-source complex information.\n\n- Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even RH? \n\n- Does the average retail investor understand incentives vs. bias?\n\n- Is the average retail investor familiar with fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?\n\n- Is an average retail investor familiar with competitive types of manufacturing processes when they invest in technologies like AMD or GE? \n\n- Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio?\n\nAt the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m sharing my writing. I\u2019m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.\n\n\n## The Fundamental Constraint\n\nThis one is not going to be easy to understand, so get your coffee ready and get comfortable. It\u2019s going to be difficult to digest the technology behind Square because it asks you to believe the premise that banking is going to change in unforeseeable ways in the near future. I currently work in the Banking-as-a-Service sector as an engineer, so I have some insight that I could offer.\n\nA fair amount of people may not know this, but organizations like Stripe, Square, PayPal, and other fintech infrastructures are just network layers over existing banks. For example, Stripe partners with Evolve Bank while Square partners with Sutton Bank. This is a win-win scenario, for now, where banks get to see the benefits of technology distribution powers, while tech companies gain a shortcut to regulatory requirements.\n\nIt may help to accept this by understanding the idea that drives the financial technology sector. In order to distribute financial services to people, regardless of net worth, trustworthiness and accountability must be established. These are regulatory frameworks developed by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) or Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) that are also challenged by such technologies like B*tcoin, where validation is arbitrary and based on fingerprinting. This trustworthiness is also the reason why you\u2019re able to instantly invest in your RH account - you are a trusted user and there is no reason to believe that you are somebody else.\n\nIt is, then, no secret as to why Square invested in B*tcoin. There are other reasons, even cultural, as to why they did, but the basic root behind the decision is that it allows research into new verification methods that makes shipping financial services even more frictionless. It is a potential vector for changing the rules of the game and leveling the playing field, so to speak. Being a software-first bank allows you to distribute at a much more rapid pace than a traditional large bank.\n\nIn short, The fuel of fintech is the underbanked. The combustion engine that burns it is cybersecurity and AI to validate that a user is trustworthy each time they commit a transaction. This is known as the KYC Problem and how each organization approaches the regulatory requirement to verify that a user is not committing fraud will determine the outcome of who dominates the fintech sector. This is also why you see customer-service as a pervasive problem.\n\nNow let me just go ahead and take the opinion here - I don\u2019t think PayPal will achieve this in the US, but their investment in MercadoLibre might take them there in some way. Latin America is a particularly interesting case study in underbanking. The reason I hate this is because I feel that a lot of their services are disconnected and low-quality. For example, Remitly allows me to send money to Mexico in a highly informed and smooth way, while Xoom (a paypal remittance service) just about shits the bed the moment I touch it. Sure, that\u2019s anecdote - but I want my investments going somewhere where the design is ALWAYS built around the customer. PayPal\u2019s management resulting in the shipment of an unfinished and thoughtless product is just an awful red flag to me. I should not be getting unknown error alert when I send money to another country. \n\n\n# The Underbanked\n\nJack Dorsey is an interesting character, who views on technology can be highlighted:\n\n&amp;gt; \u201c...to develop an open and decentralized standard for social media. The goal is for Twitter to ultimately be a client of this standard. Twitter was so open early on that many saw its potential to be a decentralized internet standard, like SMTP (email protocol). For a variety of reasons, all reasonable at the time, we took a different path and increasingly centralized Twitter. But a lot\u2019s changed over the years.\u201d\n\nInterestingly enough, Twitter is used in such a manner. The Tweet system these days gets shared across all social media platforms due to its simple design and even appears interactively during sporting events or billboards.\n\nIn my view, Jack Dorsey sees the current period of time as a turning point in internet communications and the underbanked. It is clear as day in its marketing strategy, where Square seller services is marketed strongly toward immigrants and first-time entrepreneurs while Cash App is strongly marketed toward young, first-time banking customers. No really, go ahead and look at two things:\n\n- Cash App\u2019s Twitter and advertising strategy\n- The geographic results on Google Trends when searching \u201cCash App vs. Venmo\u201d. Southern USA generally sees less banking due to increased poverty.\n\nIt is clear as day and the reason is due to the nature of the demographics of underbanked users. You see, access to banking is not much different than access to the internet or access to clean water.  That is, the closer you are to poverty, the closer you are to lacking access to basic resources. What is interesting about Square\u2019s youth &amp;amp; culture strategy is that it builds a life-long trust with the org. You\u2019ve heard it before, \u201cwhy doesn\u2019t school teach us important thing like taxes or investing?\u201d. Square is attacking that pulse in its design. It offers:\n\n1. The ability to start a business\n2. The ability to invest and educate in basic stocks\n3. The ability to invest and educate in bitcoin\n4. The ability to save on basic purchases\n5. The ability to file taxes (not yet, but the company acquired the means to)\n\nWhat this inevitably means is that we probably won\u2019t even see Square operating at \u201cfull-force\u201d until at least 2030 and beyond, as these early aged customers grow with Square and embed more of their financials.\n\n# Speculation\n\nThis is what I expect after examining regulatory environments, product quality, and competitive outlooks:\n\n1. Square will either acquire Sutton Bank or reduce its dependency on Sutton Bank\u2019s regulatory offerings.\n2. Square will become a bank to avoid direct competition with Big Tech, while competing aggressively against Big Banking by offering the ability to ship financial services.\n3. The way they will achieve this is by developing a stronger form of cybersecurity and AI that will allow a smoother verification process.\n4. Square will develop an internet railway, where exchanging currency will be accessible in different mediums like video-games or streams that may compete with orgs like Visa or MasterCard.\n5. Square will compete with Banking-as-a-service and checkout offerings like Stripe, Plaid, and Shopify.\n\n\nPls folllw.\n\nhttps://i.pcmag.com/imagery/reviews/06hGKT6YUeRY99vz4MVPPh0-7..1569477220.jpg",

        "selftext": " Good morning fellow investors! Only my second DD, I have been investing for 10+ years and lurking here for 6 months.\n\nMy investment strategy is to find companies that have the potential for exponential growth in the near future and are supported by my valuation forecasts. I primarily use a discounted cash flow model.\n\nI invested $26k into ATDS last week and already up \\~50%, and just invested $27k into AABB today. AABB is valued below book (at time of writing this, market cap is $26.6mm and book value is $32.8mm) is profitable and has virtually no debt!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hdjueikksaf61.png?width=1072&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53f7284a8e07e864573eaa53ca5a71cd58ae291c\n\nTicker \u2013 **AABB** \u2013 OTCMKT Current price upon writing: **0.017/share**\n\n**Please Read and do your own DD first before taking positions!!!** ASAP!!\n\n**Description:**\n\nAsia Broadband Inc. is a resource company focused on the production, supply and sale of precious and base metals, primarily to Asian markets, through the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary Asia Metals Inc.. Asia Metals utilizes its specific geographic expertise, experience and extensive industry contacts to facilitate its innovative distribution process from the production and supply of precious and base metals in Guerrero, Mexico to client sales networks in Asia. This vertical integration approach to sales transactions is the unique strength of Asia Broadband and differentiates the Company to its shareholders. Asia Broadband Inc also owns mines that are not yet producing cash flow in South America, and other regions in Mexico. The company is developing a proprietary gold backed token that is set to debut in 2021.\n\n**Leadership:** AABB\u2019s CEO is James Gilbert who has been at the helm since the company acquired its first mine in Guerrero in 2015. Although James had no background in mining prior to 2015 (that I could find), he clearly knows how to get a mining company up and running profitably! One of the keys to this success is a man named Luis Vega. Luis is the America\u2019s mining director for Total, a publicly traded energy conglomerate with a market cap of $110 BILLION. Luis invested \\~$1.5mm in AABB at its inception in the form of a convertible note, conversion terms of $.001 per share. Usually I view convertible notes as a negative, however I\u2019ll detail later why it\u2019s a positive in this case.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oqwvgmcmsaf61.png?width=978&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9077c91fed04b418cbaec2ecf8d68e43daf1804\n\n**Here\u2019s why I'm so heavily invested in this stock and believe in it's potential growth!!! Please read...**\n\n* 2020 gross profit of $16,000,000 vs 2019 gross profit of $6,733,000, an increase of 137%\n* Q3 revenue grew from $1.8mm in 2019 to $3.9mm in 2020, an increase of 116%\n* 2020 gross profit was just announced Jan 28 at $16mm, financial statements should be filed within the next 2 weeks\n* AABB retained Waters CPA Group in October 2020 to audit their books, audit is expected to be complete Q1 2021\n\nAAAAND THE KICKER...\n\n* **AABB is launching a gold backed token in 2021**\n\n**Gold Backed Token:**\n\nThis company clearly has a successful business model, is profitable and growing, and priced below book value. HOWEVER the real reason I believe this will end up on the NASDAQ is their investment in gold backed token.\n\nThe problem with conducting business in today\u2019s tokens is the volatility involved. Big name tokens (Bltc0ln) will always have their place in business, but the big money in Wall Street will never support it due to the unpredictability of value. Successful businesses are built on predictability and forecasting, which is not possible with the market today.\n\nRight now the Fed is pumping TRILLIONS of dollars into the US Economy, which will devalue the dollar globally. As local currencies around the globe become more volatile against the dollar, business will continue to recognize the benefits to the stability of gold backed currencies.\n\nSo how does AABB make money on this? Becoming THE market leader in gold tokens through a vertically integrated business model. There are currently NO gold backed token that are supported by vertically integrated acquisition of physical gold. Profitability in the companies acquisition of gold will allow them to subsidize the token through no transaction fees while they secure market share. After securing market share, then monetize.\n\nMonetizing with a transaction fee (likely fractions of a percent when scaled, significantly less than VISA/Mastercard charge) that is set by AABB literally allows the company to write their own check after their token is adopted.\n\nAlthough this revenue stream may not happen for several years, the market will undoubtedly recognize this value prior to monetization and price the company stock accordingly well before this revenue stream is activated. Think of Netflix when they pivoted from a DVD rental company to streaming service, or what's happening to ROKU stock price now during their transition into streaming TV channels that is not yet profitably monetized.\n\n**Share Structure and outstanding convertible debt:** Currently Issued 1,130,125,509 Authorized 2,600,000,000 Total issued after all outstanding convertible notes are converted: \\~1,299,000,000\n\nI don\u2019t like the 2.6billion share limit (although share limits are bullshit because they can be changed at any time by the board/directors) but considering how the company financed it\u2019s startup and growth and their current financial position I highly doubt additional shares will be issued after the convertible notes are converted (see below for dilution details)\n\nI am expecting a reverse split or buyback sometime in the next year to get shares outstanding down to the industry norm and help expedite the NASDAQ uplisting. I don\u2019t anticipate the current share structure, or potential reverse split, having a negative impact on my investment. If I were the CEO, reverse split or buyback is what I would encourage my board/shareholders to do to expedite uplisting and access to more capital to scale (cashflow/capital investments would determine which option or combination of options makes the most sense).\n\nI want to address the two convertible notes outstanding because I typically avoid companies that issue notes convertible at a discount. To sum it up, when the outstanding notes finish conversion (which I believe the Time Call note has already been converted and is being sold which explains why the stock price has dipped on news as Luis Vega withdraws some of his investment in the company) the total shares outstanding will increase by 168.9mm to a total of 1.299billion, approximately a 15% dilution of my investment. I accept this dilution as it doesn\u2019t have a significant impact on my long term valuation of AABB. Financially the company has no need to issue future convertible debt, and has not since the initial startup investments made in Q1 2016. Convertible note details from most recent 10Q are below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o78yms0rsaf61.png?width=884&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37ac9ce13fce68c8c4ccea8ef3ba24717b1934da\n\n**UPCOMING CATALYSTS:**\n\n* 2020 Earnings are due within the next two weeks\n* Audited financials are due Q1 2021 and will likely prompt an uplisting to OTCQB\n* Gold backed token token due to launch 2021\n\n**Price targets:**\n\n**Short/mid term: $.10-.20** I expect a significant increase after Luis is done extracting his investment and suppressing prices.\n\n**Long term: $0.50-$1.00++** I'm holding this long term, I expect an uplisting to NASDAQ in the next year or two \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80",

The quarterly loss per share was staggering compared to year-over-year figures. Revenue represented a major plunge. However, one number gave investors reason to support the industry and bet on a reopening rally.\n\nOil, oil, oil. It is no secret that oil prices fell victim to Covid-19, with a supply-demand imbalance, a price war and a major drop off in manufacturing activity. However, looking at reopening catalysts, analysts at Goldman Sachs are confident that things are changing. In fact, they have raised their year-end price target on the commodity. They are forecasting that West Texas Intermediate $WTI will reach $72 by the third quarter, while Brent crude will reach $75.

This is no investment advice and do your own research. \n\nI will take to trough each step in my DD. Sorry for the long post, but I want to have a discussion with you on my DD, possible flaws in my research etc. Therefore, I will post everything I do. \n\n**Okay here we go:**\n\nI have a background in economics.

        "selftext": "I updated the post below to reflect the current valuation and provide a context for evaluating FinTech companies. Obviously, I would encourage everyone to do their own DD starting with the investor [presentation](https://pubs.payoneer.com/docs/investor-presentation.pdf?_ga=2.142077554.1186770460.1612586492-2042252415.1612359068) and [webcast](https://viavid.webcasts.com/viewer/event.jsp?ei=1426630&amp;tp_key=f7e0f9ea11). I personally found the presentation short on key metrics and financial detail and long on buzz words. (I guess $95mn in bankers' fees only buys so much these days.) That said, the acquisition has yet to close and Payoneer needs to be prudent. I would also add that while I avoid stereotypes, Payoneer seems to be another addition to Israel's strong lineage and tradition of building great technology companies.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**Payoneer (FTOC)**\n\n**Summary:** Payoneer offers investors exposure to mobile and digital commerce, particularly cross-border transactions, at a reasonable entry point. What makes the investment compelling is that Payoneer has been around for 15 years, which removes a fair amount of execution risk related to growth, i.e., the team knows what they're doing. The company is also investing in providing additional services for its customer base which should contribute to growth and strengthen its competitive position.\n\nIMHO the key for the company (and the stock) is to better explain the customer ROI at the unit level and why investments now make sense from a CLTV sense. The company also needs to address flattish margins on 25% revenue growth and negative EBITDA after 15 years of operations. I think the company missed an excellent opportunity to frame the discussion out of the gate by highlighting the benefits of its scale with detailed customer metrics, e.g., subscriber acquisition costs (SAC), churn, and most importantly customer lifetime value (CLTV). These are really the metrics which matter to thoughtful investors as well as the usual financials. If this was an obvious play, it would be trading significantly higher. (Un)fortunately, most investors don't like complexity or have the patience to watch a good company become a great company. I think this may be a situation where really digging into the financials and business model could reward investors handsomely over time. That said, far more DD is needed as well as much more disclosure from the company before one can make a decision. I would encourage investors to take a modest position and then build on it as the DD validates.\n\nThe acquisition is expected to close within the first half of 2021 at which point detailed financials should be available.\n\n**Company:** Payoneer is Paypal for B2B global commerce, particularly outside North American and Europe. The company provides B2B services for millions of SMB and enterprises around the world. In 2020, the company recognized $345mn of revenue (31% Y/Y growth adjusted for the pandemic) on $44bn of transactions. The company was founded 15 years ago and operates in over 190 countries (basically the whole world).\n\n**Customers:** Enterprises and SMB. The ideal customer is a small but growing SMB doing business all over the world which needs currency, compliance and business services. Payoneer is an obvious candidate to handles these needs given its global network.\n\n**Industry and market opportunity:** B2B global marketplace. The attractiveness of FinTech can be summarized in a few words, namely, \u201cscale\u201d and \u201cnetwork effects\u201d. From the metrics Payoneer shared, it looks like they\u2019re benefitting from these dynamics but the disclosure could have been better (more about that below). Analysts estimate the global B2B market at tens of trillions $ and cross-border payments at $300mn. Obviously, the pandemic only accelerated these trends. (From the presentation, it looks like company B2B AR/AP volume more than doubled at 140% in 2020 although the CFO later cited a 53% increase in volumes so not sure exactly how to interpret that.)\n\n**Management team:** Betsy Cohen led FTOC and has extensive expensive in the FinTech space, including leading previous SPACs and founding Bancorp Bank. Scott Galit has experience at Mastercard and First Data, which is exactly what you want to see.\n\n**Business model:** Volume and customer growth drives revenues. Volumes grew over 53% in 2020 (67% adjusted for the pandemic) and is expected to grow at 44% and 33% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, which translates into 25% annual revenue growth per year for the next two years. I would say all else equal flat revenue growth vs. decelerating volume growth is a good thing but again a deeper dive into the product mix is necessary. The key here is that these growth rates are higher than the overall market so Payoneer appears to be taking share but again more DD is needed.\n\nWhile the transaction margins have been growing, the company forecasted margins to remain flat at 72% for the next two years. I believe this forecast is due to a change in the blended take rate but unfortunately the company really didn\u2019t elaborate here. I would have expected the revenue growth to drive some incremental margin expansion but I\u2019m clearly missing a piece of the story. This may be an issue for investors. That said, the CFO offered long-terms targets of +20% revenue growth and +20% EBITDA margins. I was also surprised the company wasn't EBITDA positive given how long it's been around but I need to see how much of the costs were investment or subscriber acquisition related.\n\nAs for the all-important unit-economics, the customer payback period is less than 12 months, which is nice. Disclosing CLTV would have been better. The company also noted net volume retention (i.e., same store comparison of customer Y/Y volume) is over 100% but did not disclose exactly what the percentage is. This is somewhat irrelevant since anything less than 100% and the company wouldn't be getting acquired. I found the SMB cohort volume on slide 27 interesting. While it's lacking a Y-axis for volume (ugh!), its clear each year's cohort of customers are roughly following a similar trajectory although 2015 seems to be a slight outlier. Now, if the company would just disclose the unit economics for these cohorts, you'd have your investment decision made. I think at this point, you have to trust the quality of FTOC's DD. My guess is they drilled down and liked what they saw.\n\nNote: the adjusted numbers were a turnoff. Covid happened. If you're benefitting from the acceleration in cross-border traffic due to the pandemic, don't exclude those sectors negatively impacted by said pandemic. I believe the company was done a disservice by its bankers here in trying to manipulate the numbers. Investors aren't stupid and if they are, they're not the ones you want. This massaging coupled with the lack of PF shares outstanding is a little concerning.\n\n**Valuation:** FinTech companies such as PayPal, Square, and Payoneer are valued on subscriber growth. The key metric which the analysts will judge the company on is customer lifetime value (CLTV), which is an NPV of the total cash flows from each customer over his/her lifetime. (Analysts apply a similar approach to wireless companies and data center REITs where each new subscriber or data center build is viewed on a payback and NPV basis. Technically, these companies are valued on earnings, EBITDA or AFFO but its CLTV or customer NPV which determines the valuation multiple.) Counterintuitively, once the company reaches a certain scale and growth slows, the margins and FCF will improve but the analysts will become concerned that growth is moderating even though the financials are improving. (That's when the smart money will bail.) Again, CLTV is the name of the game and is the primary way to evaluate companies such as Payoneer. There's a reason why the company included different cohort growth rates and mentioned a less than 12-month customer payback in the presentation. These are the metrics that matter.\n\nBased on FTOC's current share price of $13.50, Payoneer is currently trading at roughly $6bn, which assumes \\~430mn total shares outstanding.\\* (This is a SWAG as management did not include a pro forma cap table with shares.) The current valuation implies an enterprise value (EV) to revenue multiple on 2021 revenue in the mid-teens, which is much closer to global payment processors such as First Data than digital payment and ecommerce companies such as PayPal, Square, and Shopify. FTOC shareholders will own 19.2% at closing. Finally, there is a management earn-out of 30 million shares at the $15 and $17 mark which will dilute existing FTOC shareholders but comes with 10-25% upside from current levels.\n\n* The initial valuation assumed an enterprise value (EV) of $3.3 billion, which equates to 7.6x EV to 2021 revenue. Just to clarify, FTOC was negotiating a CASH investment, i.e., the $755mn raised at IPO and held in trust, not an acquisition with its shares as currency. FTOC's pro forma ownership of 19.2% for a $755mn equity investment roughly equates to the pro forma market cap of $3.8bn mentioned in the presentation. Yes, there is some dilution from the sponsor's shares and the 30m share earn-out but I would argue that FTOC got a fair price for its investment as evidenced by the fact that FTOC shares are trading 30% above NAV.\n\n**Investment Thesis**\n\n**1.** **Majority of traffic stays within the network.** In my opinion, this is the key company metric because it reflects how valuable the network is to its customers. This metric continues to increase for Payoneer.\n\n**2.** **Exposure to digital commerce and mobility trends.** As everyone realizes, this is a big and growing market which the pandemic accelerated.\n\n3. **Global network provides network effects and is difficult to replicate.** The benefits of network effects cannot be overstated as Paypal has proven. As a company acquires more customers, the value of its network increases. Payoneer\u2019s business model leverages this same dynamic. Moreover, its network would be very difficult to replicate. The company\u2019s global platform includes over 80 banks and clearing partners in over 100 countries. The company also provides customers data about its transactions, which I believe will be increasingly useful and sticky.\n\n4. **Playing the long game.** The company\u2019s focus on investing for future services is actually what gets me most excited as it may ward off near-term investor interest and improves its competitive position. It\u2019s also a sign of a mature management team. The opportunity to provide additional services such as working capital, compliance and tax services seems like an obvious strategic move to drive growth. Expect M&amp;A to figure into the company\u2019s strategic plans as well.\n\n**5.** **Attractive valuation:** Payoneer\u2019s valuation is much closer to global payment processors than digital payment and ecommerce companies. The negative EBITDA, flattish transactional margins, and \"adjusted\" revenue are certainly issues and need to be addressed. However, as noted above, Payoneer needs to be viewed in the correct context to value it appropriately. While the company doesn't merit PayPal's multiple given it doesn't have its growth or scale (yet), the company is certainly benefitting from scale/ network effects and deserves a multiple which reflects this. I expect the valuation multiple to rise (or \"expand\" in WS parlance) as the business becomes better understood within the investment community and the company posts a few solid quarters of earnings results. I feel like this is more \"a when rather than if\" issue. Thus, the current valuation represents an attractive entry point for current investors.\n\n**Risks:**\n\n1. **Competition:** PayPal is a giant and only getting stronger as 4Q results testifies. The company has leveraged network scale effects to achieve a market cap rivaling MasterCard. Skrill is also well known in this space. MasterCard and Visa certainly play in cross border transactions but I don\u2019t think they provide the level of services Payoneer does. Definitely need to do more DD here.\n2. **Customer risk:** Related to the previous point, if Payoneer loses a large customer like AMZN, the stock will take a hit (cf AMEX walking away from CostCo).\n3. **Regulatory:** Payoneer needs to navigate every country\u2019s regulatory environment. The company has certainly done a good job but as the FAANGS can testify, the larger you get, the bigger target you become, e.g., Europe is trying to displace MA and V.\n4. **Crypto currency:** At this point, everyone in FinTech better have a crypto currency strategy even if its just allowing transactions in BTC. Crypto currency was made for seamless cross-border currency transactions which makes a crypto strategy doubly important for Payoneer.\n5. **FX exposure:** I\u2019m sure the company has a world class FX hedging team but I feel like this needs to be flagged given the scale of the business. Investors could unintentionally have FX exposure.\n\n**TLDR:** Payoneer is a proven company in a great space with a solid management team that is playing the long-game. IMHO, it could be a very attractive investment for LT investors at the current valuation with the caveat that far more DD is needed around competition and the financial model. I also would not be surprised if PayPal took them out given their $6bn market cap vs. PayPal's +$300bn. It would be a very nice complement to PayPal's existing business assuming the transaction past regulatory scrutiny. My advice is to spend more time digging and in the meantime acquire a small position upon which to build.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nI am not a financial advisor.\n\nPositions:\n\n1. 1,000 FTOC common shares\n2. 10 February/December Covered Calls @ 12.50 (short) /17.50 (long).

        "selftext": "Previously, I've made my case for Fiverr, a company for freelancers, only last week. Since my recommendation, the stock has grown from 270 to 320 as time of writing. That's an \\~20% increase. I believe the future of work will also be 'online' as opposed to traditional 'in office'. The last year, the coronavirus has only accelerated the shift to online-work.\n\nI now propose another stock, PayPal. What's my reasoning for this? When you look at growth stocks, you also look at their suppliers. For Tesla, for example, you look at who's supplying the batteries for electric cars and can bet on that as well. The rise of Tesla and electric cars has created a halo effect, and the rise in their stocks for all of the industry.\n\nNow, when you think of Fiverr, and the rise of companies based on online work, payment processing companies will benefit. When you transact with freelancers half way across the world, we are looking at payment processing companies that serve as a method of payment for your transaction. The likes of Visa, Mastercard, and Paypal stand to benefit. Why specifically PayPal?\n\nBasically not only will PayPal stand to benefit from increased transactions as outlined above, Paypal also looking to get into anything related to digital payments. To quote, PayPal has jumped into the mobile payments space with Venmo, which is now the most widely used mobile peer-to-peer payments app out there. PayPal has also delved into cryptocurrencies, and now accepts cryptos on its payment platform. What\u2019s more, the payments company is also jumping into more direct shopping and stock trading.\n\nBasically, it\u2019s doing it all. PayPal is turning into an all-in-one digital wallet for consumers. They are looking at doubling it's user-base and hence revenues. It's parallel is Alibaba's Ant Financial. It's massive in China, and before the Chinese government clamped down on the IPO, it was looking to the biggest IPO in all history.\n\nIf you are looking to place a blue-chip stock in your portfolio, I believe Paypal will the next best bet.",

The 200-day moving average line is trending up for at least 1 month\n\n4. The 50-day moving average is above both the 150-day and 200-day moving averages\n\n5. The current stock price is trading above the 50-day moving average\n\n6. The current stock price is at least 30% above it\u2019s 52-week low\n\n7. The current stock price is within at least 25% of its 52-week high\n\n8. The relative strength ranking is no less than 70. Preferably in the 80s or 90s.\n\nIt's not explicitly stated, but he also looks at the long term trend and requires that it has an upward trajectory.\n\nI ran the filter on stocks with an RSI above 78 and got the following matches (after filtering out any that had really low share prices).\n\n**DISCK**\n\n* Latest Price: 45.86\n* 52 Week High: 45.92\n* 52 Week Low: 15.43\n* 30 days ago price: 34.16\n* 50 day MA: 34.48\n* 150 day MA: 25.99\n* 200 day MA: 24.51\n* RSI: 85.53\n\n\n**DISCA**\n\n* Latest Price: 55.65\n* 52 Week High: 55.67\n* 52 Week Low: 17.12\n* 30 days ago price: 39.00\n* 50 day MA: 40.26\n* 150 day MA: 29.63\n* 200 day MA: 27.73\n* RSI: 82.44\n\n\n**SBNY**\n\n* Latest Price: 218.94\n* 52 Week High: 223.12\n* 52 Week Low: 67.54\n* 30 days ago price: 164.12\n* 50 day MA: 172.76\n* 150 day MA: 126.39\n* 200 day MA: 118.64\n* RSI: 84.56\n\n\n**CSWC**\n\n* Latest Price: 22.50\n* 52 Week High: 21.66\n* 52 Week Low: 6.81\n* 30 days ago price: 18.18\n* 50 day MA: 19.10\n* 150 day MA: 16.80\n* 200 day MA: 16.20\n* RSI: 83.10\n\n\n**IEP**\n\n* Latest Price: 66.37\n* 52 Week High: 66.14\n* 52 Week Low: 30.34\n* 30 days ago price: 56.60\n* 50 day MA: 58.03\n* 150 day MA: 53.21\n* 200 day MA: 52.70\n* RSI: 82.19\n\n\n**ZBRA**\n\n* Latest Price: 489.42\n* 52 Week High: 494.91\n* 52 Week Low: 150.06\n* 30 days ago price: 402.63\n* 50 day MA: 418.08\n* 150 day MA: 361.06\n* 200 day MA: 336.96\n* RSI: 81.03\n\n\n**PRTA**\n\n* Latest Price: 23.04\n* 52 Week High: 27.20\n* 52 Week Low: 7.10\n* 30 days ago price: 13.77\n* 50 day MA: 15.00\n* 150 day MA: 12.82\n* 200 day MA: 12.64\n* RSI: 80.24\n\n\n**HAYN**\n\n* Latest Price: 29.26\n* 52 Week High: 29.70\n* 52 Week Low: 15.14\n* 30 days ago price: 23.69\n* 50 day MA: 24.43\n* 150 day MA: 21.87\n* 200 day MA: 21.27\n* RSI: 80.19\n\nI guess the thing I'm missing about these is all of those stocks seem to have already massively jumped and are at/near their 52 week highs after seeing a massive run-up.  If this filter criteria is meant to find investments that might be good to make a profit on, isn't it a bit counter intuitive to purchase stocks that have already seen a massive increase in the last month or so?\n\nI'm currently paper trading these to see how they do but so far it's only been a few days and I don't have enough data to really determine anything, haha.",

        "selftext": "To all you degenerates suffering from IBS after buying at the top of $GME, pop another one of your Linzess pills and read on for your chance at another lottery ticket in the booming biotech space. If you google the active ingredient on your Linzess package you\u2019ll see that Linaclotide is a guanylyl-cyclase (GC) agonist. What that gibberish means is it causes an increase in a chemical involved in energy metabolism which activates your intestines and improves motility. Now the company that discovered Linzess has another asset spun out in a new company that crosses the blood brain barrier and is going to do for your brain what they did for your gut. We have exciting catalysts coming this year, so you don\u2019t need a buy and hold boomer Warren Buffett approach.\n\nCyclerion therapeutics ($CYCN) has already conducted the pre-clinical and phase I studies showing strong biochemical data in animals that there is a solid mechanism of action and safe in humans. As they were moving this asset through preclinical trials, they flopped on another soluble GC agonist with sickle cell and heart failure, both of which were related to trial design, and sent the stock tumbling to the $2 range. It has now recovered, and the team is wholly focused on developing their CNS asset.\n\nPositive indicators including:\n\n\\-Insider buying including their chief scientific officer, who is from Bayer, purchasing $300k open market in November, as well as multiple directors buying &gt; 20M in shares at a price of $16 last year. Clearly the board is incentivized to get the stock price back to this level. ([http://openinsider.com/screener?s=CYCN](http://openinsider.com/screener?s=CYCN))\n\n\\-Institutional ownership including a variety of notable large holders, like EcoR1, a very reputable biotech hedge fund. ([https://whalewisdom.com/stock/cycn](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/cycn))\n\n\\-Massive stake recently just disclosed via 13G by MFN Partners, a Harvard-backed hedge fund just across the Charles River from this company's headquarters in Cambridge, MA.\n\n\\-Healthy short interest of \\~20% ([https://fintel.io/ss/us/cycn](https://fintel.io/ss/us/cycn))\n\n\\-Good biomarker data in their exploratory trial thus increasing likelihood of a positive signal in their phase 2 MELAS trial (see February corporate presentation).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpcoming catalysts include:\n\n\\-A ph2 MELAS trial, with topline data in mid-2021: single arm, N=20, open-label, 29 days, and ONLY looking at disease relevant biomarkers for a win. High odds of seeing some sort of signal given the above and below IMO, with big read-through to the ph2 Alzheimer's trial\n\n\\-Additionally, company has guided to out-licensing all non-CNS assets (there are 4 of them) and doing a broad CNS collaboration. Any surprise announcement on that business development front could send the stock soaring\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith the broad biotech sell off late last week, now is a good time to get into this exciting company.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional source:\n\nFebruary IR presentation: [https://cyclerion.gcs-web.com/static-files/5d4e0343-0d3e-4774-bf23-aa0964be2e51](https://cyclerion.gcs-web.com/static-files/5d4e0343-0d3e-4774-bf23-aa0964be2e51)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong shares of $CYCN at 4.3",

Everything you read is highly questionable and accuracy of information is not guaranteed. No financial advice here. I have a significant long position in PSTH. The merger target and date could be incorrect. I\u2019m talking up my book. This is not a research report, just speculation by a heroin addict.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Thesis: There is two parts to this speculation**\n\nA. PSTH will merge with Stripe. (For these see A-Exhibits)\n\nB. The announcement will come on Feb 17th. (For these see B-Exhibits)\n\n**What is Stripe?** A payment processing company that competes with Square and PayPal. In April 2020, the San Francisco-based company ra ised $600 million from investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital at a valuation of $36 billion. It is currently being valued at $70 billion or more. Stripe was founded by Irish brothers John and Patrick Collison founded Stripe in 2010. I\u2019m very familiar with the Irish, and the duo are extremely smart and have European way of thinking and mannerisms. \n\n**Background:** I presented the speculative evidence for Stripe being the target in A-Exhibits and timing in B-exhibits. A lot of these are scraped from various people who have done lots of digging. A speculative trade like this has high risk but also high reward. Nailing the timing on this would be tickets to retirement for some. So SPACs move massively on any news of discussion with a good target. Stripe is in my opinion as sweet honey. I highly doubt that Ackman and all those big investors like Guggenheim would invest in a SPAC without having a solid short list. I think their short list had Bloomberg and Stripe on it. They flirted with AirBnB and Coinbase just to see their chances. If any of those happened or a new sweet target emerged then they would do a quick second SPAC. They used PSTH to grab attention of other companies and see what they can attract for their future SPACs. Kind of like what Chamat did. I speculate that Stripe was their target and Stripe was just spending time getting ready for the Feb 17th announcement. All this is speculation. I also have read speculations about StarLink and Plaid and those really didn\u2019t hold any water. Collison brothers\u2019 way of running their companies has been very European like. Very cooperative and trusting of the process. They didn\u2019t mind giving a big chunk of their company to Y-combinator. They didn\u2019t mind hiring agitators. They just seem to operate like they live in Ireland and everyone is trustable. They are not used to dealing with NYC sharks. They are easy prey for a top predator like AckFuckingMan.  \n\n**Exhibit A-1: Stripe has been going on a hiring spree. 973 job postings vs last year 260** \n\n[https://stripe.com/jobs/search](https://stripe.com/jobs/search)\n\nBelow is how their site looks now:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/flnlxlslw9h61.png?width=722&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87db6dabc36405f78023b03d4bc034796b530c2f\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBelow is how their postings looked in April of 2020\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4i8x16pnw9h61.png?width=684&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=669af8e7fa5c787bf7d50335fbcf5d438fc95792\n\nHiring needs money! They are obviously seeing a huge injection of money coming their way. \n\n**Exhibit A-2: Privacy statement of Stripe updated** \n\nNew text added regarding \u201cother entity which buys us\u201d to their privacy statement. \n\nBelow is the privacy statement once updated:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rrtoyxcqw9h61.png?width=668&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86a4c8d22787ba4f57c3d79d5afd555895de24e4\n\nBelow is how it looked in early 2020: (see it is missing that sentence)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img w9qghpxrw9h61...*\n\n**Exhibit A-3: Bill Ackman follows 190 people on twitter and oddly 3 are stripe et al**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bf79j3ntw9h61.png?width=658&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1595fba57ccfa27260e3d53f21e8b7b5140ce393\n\n**Exhibit A-4: Ackman mentioned that he talked to stripe** \n\n[https://youtu.be/GmaCarSyBk4?t=917](https://youtu.be/GmaCarSyBk4?t=917)   Minute 15:17\n\nStripe wasn\u2019t ready to go public but they sure seem to be working towards it. Bill mentions \u201cManagement\u201d, \u201cInfrastructure\u201d, and \u201csystems\u201d. So that ties into exhibit A-1.

So they were talking about getting more money at the same time that we suspected they were talking with Ackman\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-24/payments-startup-stripe-is-said-in-talks-to-raise-new-funding](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-24/payments-startup-stripe-is-said-in-talks-to-raise-new-funding)\n\n**Exhibit A-9: Ackman smearing the competition**\n\nStripe does not allow adult content payments.

This points at NDA and ongoing developments. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cl4w71t4x9h61.png?width=564&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a7c4700a54a3ac65ad9d1fb506d1cf040831dbe\n\n**Exhibit A-10: Jackie Reses** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nwnoow46x9h61.png?width=587&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c0eebb0de8cba03967d156e53fc2bf166e12002\n\nShe has been liking Stripe T-shirts and was invited to ClubHouse by a stripe member via some degrees of separation. Jackie was the head of capital for square and stepped down. She has also been liking tweets from Ackman. \n\n**Exhibit A-10: Peter Collison interacted with posts about SPAC on Twitter.** \n\nThose were on Jan 8th. They have been deleted since. I could be wrong about this exhibit.\n\n=====================================================================\n\n**Exhibit B-1: Bill Ackman earnings call:**\n\n[https://centurylink.cwebcast.com/ses/2CUtOMyHmr7q63DSO2LpyA\\~\\~?ek=0fb7e9e1-3910-4dd3-a749-24f81df281ad](https://centurylink.cwebcast.com/ses/2CUtOMyHmr7q63DSO2LpyA~~?ek=0fb7e9e1-3910-4dd3-a749-24f81df281ad)\n\nMin 42:30\n\n*\u201cIn terms of timing, what we said at the time of the IPO is we said it would take us, we thought about six months to identify a target that we would be in a position to hopefully announce a deal by sometime in Q1 and then close the transaction in the ordinary course thereafter. Nothing that we have experienced to-date suggests that we won\u2019t meet our expected timeframe\u201d-* \n\n**Exhibit B-2: The two meetings are right one after another. Seems to be coordinated.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h61sx429x9h61.png?width=633&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15612de8d048b82be6287c5626e9c086601e0c54\n\n**Exhibit B-3: Note the bump in price and volume earlier this week**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img raei4tsax9h61...*\n\nThis points to some insiders getting ready for the announcement. \n\n**Exhibit B-4: IV on the call options suggest big imminent news**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cd58eumcx9h61.png?width=630&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93925ea255d0296de7b7b6f003af3846968d2993\n\nThis was captured before news of 13G filed on Friday. \n\n**Exhibit B-5: Twitter activity**\n\nOn Feb 8th Bill tweeted a Rap Song about SPACs: [https://twitter.com/BillAckman/status/1358799402371076096](https://twitter.com/BillAckman/status/1358799402371076096)\n\nBill is not too active on twitter, nor is John Collison.\n\nPatrick and John Collison both had a notable reduction in twitter activity in first week of Feb and all of a sudden they came alive on Feb 8th. This is the day that PSTH shares jumped \\~6% on no news. Insiders buying? There was a lot of unexplained excitement on that day both in twitter behaviour of parties involved and price of PSTH. \n\n**Exhibit B-6: 13G filing by PSH**\n\nNews of raising more money coming out just now! See 13G filled on **2/12/21** after hours. \n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336528/000119312521041777/d105691dsc13g.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336528/000119312521041777/d105691dsc13g.htm) \n\nI think there is a lot of confusion about this. People are saying that it is PSH increasing the PIPE, and this is pointing to a bigger deal. I think this is false. I think for that you need an S-3 filing.

        "selftext": "**TL;DR Basics:**\n\n* Latin American and Canadian subsidiary of InBev (Bud, Stella). Owns Guaran\u00e1 Antarctica (Brazil's #2 soft drink, after Coke) and Pepsi distribution rights through at least 2027.\n* Rock-solid financials.\n* Trading at a depressed value because of COVID price drop and likely-reversing currency depreciation in Latin America.\n* **Verdict:** This is a penny stock that shouldn't be a penny stock. Stable, long-term market leader with a substantial moat in both the alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages sector. An excellent hedge against the current bubbling market that should still show significant gains due to COVID reopening. Great place to park and protect profits.\n\n**Institutions, Valuation, Financials:**\n\n* Institutional Ownership: 98.27% (Fidelity)\n* Float: 272.2 million (Total\\*0.0173)\n* Short Interest/Days to Cover: 3.0 (MarketBeat)\n* Debt/Equity: 0.03 (Morningstar)\n* Current Ratio: 1.3 (My calcs)\n* Dividend Yield: 3.32% Annual (Fidelity)\n* P/E TTM: 25.55 vs. 46.14 industry avg. (Fidelity)\n* P/B TTM: 3.15 vs. 9.33 industry avg. (Fidelity)\n\n**Macro Upsides: Currency Recovery Play**\n\nIn January, the Real depreciated 33% vs. USD due to COVID risks prompting a flight to safety. For newbies, a \"flight to safety\" is when USD appreciates vs. everybody and JPY/Euro appreciate to a lesser extent vs. developing world currencies. This put a short-term squeeze on developing world businesses with global supply chains.\n\nWhy? The challenge for developing world businesses is that their ***income*** is derived from local currencies - in this case, Brazilian Real is the main one, but also CAD, Argentine peso, &amp; Chilean peso - but their ***costs*** are primarily derived from US Dollars, because international commodity contracts are denominated in US Dollars. So, if the company wants to buy sugar for soft drinks or barley for beer brewing, they pay in USD. But when they sell, they earn income in real or pesos. Currency pressure therefore puts pressure on profit margins.\n\nGoing forward, emerging market currencies should remain stable or appreciate vs. USD as vaccine rollouts continue; the real economy stabilizes; and institutional risk appetite normalizes. Coupled with Brazil's recent pension reforms and relatively strong financial picture in the banking sector, I find it highly likely the Real has bottomed-out and will appreciate in the intermediate term.\n\nNote: This is my judgment, as someone who taught undergraduate development economic policy courses for a decade. There are competing opinions, which I discuss below and include in the sources.\n\n* Credentials, for those who care: MA International Development 2009 (American University); PhD (ABD) @ UC San Diego).\n\n(An aside: I am curious if newbies appreciate this kind of content. If so, **let me know in the comments or PM me** \\- I'm likely starting an economic policy substack to help folks understand the broader picture on regulatory issues and such.)\n\n**Monthly and Weekly Technicals:**\n\nTrading at Long-Term trend support on the monthly chart. Monthly Trend Resistance is around $2.90-3.00.\n\nDaily/Weekly charts have it in the middle of an upward channel trade, but still significantly below 2019 prices. Immediate support levels are at $2.77 and $2.50\n\nMonthly resistance levels: $4.15, $5.15, and $6.00.\n\nMy current target is in the $4.50-$5.50 range.\n\n**Downside risks:**\n\n* Slightly declining market share in Alcoholic beverages sector to Heineken and Cervejara Petropolis. A lot of this due to Heineken's previous acquisition of Kirin, aggressive marketing, and the robust craft beer market in Brazil. This has led to increased marketing costs and a slightly declining operating margin. I consider this the most relevant critique. However, I think it is mitigated by multiple factors.  \n\n   * The most recent filings from AmBev show expanding craft beer portfolio with solid growth in those brands.\n   * AmBev still has a substantial moat at \\~60% market share. Market share erosion is likely to subside given the dominant position.\n   * Pressure from the downturn in the real and COVID will exert disproportionate pressure on smaller businesses. Given AmBev's rock-solid financial position and dominant market presence, this creates excellent brand acquisition opportunities.\n* Potential currency risk from two things:  \n\n   * Vaccine rollouts in South America being undermined by political actors, the most likely being Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil. Given Biden is US president, support from international development institutions, and elite desires to reopen, I find this fairly unlikely.\n   * Currency risks may continue if vaccination proves a challenge or there is a new COVID surge. Again, I think fairly unlikely - the dominant likelihood is capital flows returning to emerging markets as vaccination rollouts continue.\n\n**Position:** Long 1300 shares @ $2.85\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am not a financial advisor. All investments taken at your own risk.",

(SIOX)** is a company with huge potential within the biotech industry. It is a clinical-stage company focused on developing gene therapies to radically improve the lives of patients with neurodegenerative diseases.    \n\n\nThey combine cutting-edge science with bold imagination to develop genetic medicines that aim to radically improve the lives of patients. Their current pipeline of clinical-stage candidates includes the first potentially curative AAV-based gene therapies for GM1 gangliosidosis and Tay-Sachs/Sandhoff diseases, which are rare and uniformly fatal pediatric conditions caused by single gene deficiencies. They are also expanding the reach of gene therapy to highly prevalent conditions such as Parkinson\u2019s disease, which affects millions of patients globally.   \n\n\n&gt;Sio Gene Therapies Announces First Patient Dosed in Clinical Trial of AXO-AAV-GM2 in Patients with Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff **, February 3, 2021, 1:00 PM**   \n[https://i.gyazo.com/771b9779d49cbfd4a6ad619ab1686ea4.png?share=reddit](https://i.gyazo.com/771b9779d49cbfd4a6ad619ab1686ea4.png?share=reddit)\n\nThey are also at stage 2 with the Parkinsons disease. This company has no market cap literally, their balance sheet is not the best but has been reducing debt ALOT within the years. Research also brought to light the fact that roughly 52% of the company is controlled by the top 4 shareholders suggesting that these owners wield significant influence on the business. This is indeed a serious business, been in the game for years also. **ROIVANT SCIENCES LTD  itself owns 38% of the company** and is a very well known company here in Schweiz.   \n\n\nCompany has been running flat whole 2020, and with the upcoming trials and news, I am impressed the volume is low. The company really is under the radar. Look it up and tell me what you think :).  \n\n\nRS/MA calls for a buy, but you cannot really tell with those volumes. I will say this should be around 20$ ish easy if they complete their trials if you think otherwise then enlighten me. Been spending hours upon hours trying to find companies like this and they usually pay good in the end.

        "selftext": "For a long time, folks covering the US MSO industry have been talking about the Big 4 ($GTBIF, $CURLF, $CRLBF, and $TCNNF), but its time we started talking about the Big 5 with the newest addition being Verano Holdings ($VRNOF) which went public last Wednesday. Below is my investment thesis on $VRNOF. \n\n**TL;dr: The stock is a high-quality way to play the coming US cannabis wave and could be a 2-3.5x over the next year. I believe this will be a stock that institutions will gravitate towards. The US MSOs will be the most direct beneficiaries of growing cannabis consumption, and $VRNOF has one of the best management teams, several growth drivers, best-in-class margin profile, and trades at a discount to its Big 4 peers. The company went public last week and is still under-the-radar.**\n\n*Note: the company is listed in Canada under $VRNO and is available over-the-counter under $VRNOF.*\n\nCurrent Price / Market Cap: $24.44 / $7.1Bn\n\n**Thesis**\n\n* Cannabis is a $80-100Bn consumer staple category but only $20Bn are legal sales. The rest of the      market is illicit. In addition to seeing the overall industry grow, the US operators should see a strong tailwind from illicit sales converting to legal sales\n* Attractive 14-state footprint\n   * Core markets of IL, FL, MD, AZ, NJ, and PA are large and projected to grow above the industry average rate over the next 2-3 years\n      * IL one of the best adult-use states in the US\n      * AZ just started adult use sales at the beginning of 2021 and is poised to see significant growth\n      * NJ just approved adult use sales; recreational sales likely to start in early 2022 but could be        sooner\n      * FL, PA, and MD could enact adult-use legislation in the next 2-3 years\n   * Near-term development markets (2021+): MA, NV, OH, MI, AR\n   * Longer-term development markets (2022+): WV, CA, MO \n* Strong financial profile makes $VRNOF a top 3 MSO \n   * 40%+ EBITDA margins currently places it #3 behind $TCNNF and $AYRWF; potential for $VRNOF to become #2 in 2021\n   * Expected 2021 EBITDA of $350MM likely places it #2/3 amongst all MSOs (excluding any new M&amp;A)\n   * Anticipate tuck-in acquisitions in core markets that would provide upside to these numbers,       namely AZ (dispensaries) and PA (dispensaries and cultivation)\n   * No debt; has issued equity sparingly\n* Strong management with significant insider ownership\n   * Conversations with folks in the industry suggest $VRNOF is one of the best, if not the best, operator in the industry (as evidenced by the large EBITDA margins on a broad footprint)\n   * Total insider ownership: 20%+\n   * CEO (George Archos) ownership: \\~19%\n* Several industry catalysts including:\n   * Federal decriminalization of cannabis\n   * Banking bill would allow cannabis businesses to access the banking system, reduce their cost of capital, improve their margin profiles, make customer transactions more seamless, and allow $VRNOF to list on a major exchange\n   * Adult use legalization in PA, FL, OH\n* $VRNOF trading at a 25% discount to other large, diversified MSO peers ($GTBIF/$CURLF/$CRLBF)\n   * $VRNOF trading at 14.5x 2022 EBITDA vs. $GTBIF (21.1x)/$CURLF (19.1x)/$CRLBF (18x)\n* Pre-public private round was 5x oversubscribed with largely institutional participation. Demonstrates institutional interest in the company. \n\n**What is the stock worth?**\n\n* Amongst the Big 4, $GTBIF is $VRNOF's best comp. The companies have diversified footprints in      limited-license states and the CEOs of both companies are regarded as amongst the best in the industry. $GTBIF trades at 21x 2022 EBITDA vs. $VRNOF at $14.5x. If $VRNOF trades in-line with $GTBIF, the stock could see 45% upside\u2026\n* ...but what would you pay for a high-growth consumer staple business growing 40%+ organically with 40%+ EBITDA margins? 30x EBITDA ($50 target price - 2x upside)? 40x ($67)? 50x ($83 - 3.5x upside)? I believe the stock (and group) will re-rate higher as we get positive news throughout 2021 around state legalization plans, earnings, and potentially federal action\n* How does the valuation gap close? Now that the company is public, I expect it to increase its profile      and share its story through attending conferences, speaking to investors, etc. I also anticipate we will see research firms initiate coverage on the stock over the next 3-6 months. Continued execution will also be a driver.      \n\n**Risks**\n\n* Execution missteps\n* Regulatory changes that restrict cannabis sales and/or how cannabis can be sold (industry risk)\n* Broader market/macro risk",

They have are working to bring to market a few different treatments that improve the efficacy and delivery of treatments.\n\nI'm not a doctor, so take what I say with a grain of salt, but to my understanding they have technology that makes various compounds that are not well absorbed, far more bioavailable. Meaning lower costs to produce drugs and higher effectiveness. \n\nCurrent fast-tracked promise research for their tech as a COVID 19 treatment. (results due in April 2021)\nhttps://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/bell-media-ica-launch-inaugural-145800617.html?soc_src=social-sh&amp;soc_trk=ma\n\n\nTheir preclinical trials of ivermectin (an antiviral being researched as a COVID 19 treatment) increased absorbtion by 800%.\nhttps://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/droplet-micron-educator-kit-offers-200600928.html?soc_src=social-sh&amp;soc_trk=MA \n\n\nSpeculation:\nThe Canadian National Stock Exchange (CNSX or CNE) is for microcaps in the Canadian market. This is speculation on my part, however, as this company grows I would expect them to be up listed at some point in the future. Maybe the TSXV or even the TSX. Those are larger exchanges where more institutional and retail investor money is available.\n\nRisks:\n\nThe biggest risk as this point is the at their Quicksome tech doesn't work. The research so far is very promising, however we will have to wait and see that.\n\nTheir is some patent risk, as always in the pharma space. However, they have a good track record with documenting and securing patents, so I judge this risk to be relatively small.",

        "selftext": "Often time I find my self in situations where I really like a pennystock company and think they are good for long term only for my stock to go up like crazy fast and I am left with a desicision \"sell now and buy the dip\" OR \"hold for more gains\"\n\nThis is an issue I find very common in pennystocks because these guys can go up like 10000% in a week lol... So if I were to sell at 500% for this thing to go up after I get off would be a big big fomo for me.\n\nI had a friend who held TSNP and made insane money from it but didn't sell when it jumped all the way to 1.70 cos they believe in the long run which honestly is not a problem with them cos long term you won't care about dips, but when TSNP tanked all the way to like 0.9 they wished they sold off atleast 50% of their position at 1.70 and rebought at 0.9 for even stronger position. \n\nI was hoping to see if its possible to incorporate moving averages for these types of situations in order to take out the guess work. Assuming I am long on a stock but do want to close my positions if indicators say its going to dip so technically I would end up swing trading at that point.\n\nBut what kinda of moving averages to use? Theres SMA and thers EMA and what period would it be?\n\nI know SMA is lagging behind EMA so I would assume SMA is better for this situation where I am long term/swing trading compared to if I was day trading.\n\nWould something like a 20 SMA and 50 SMA be okay? I like the 200 SMA as well but unsure if relevant for short-mid term trades where I want to make lots of profit &gt; sell &gt; wait for consolidation/dip &gt; rebuy in.\n\nBesides some stocks don't even have 200 days worth of info. I guess if I was holding for 6 months then sure 200 SMA semms fine to me\n\nSecond question assuming 20 and 50 SMA is okay, whats interval to use? \n\nIf I am long/swing trading I would assume intervals of 30 mins or maybe even hours or even daily chart would be good here?\n\nFinal question, is how to use this moving average? Would the 20 average crossing below the 50 be a pretty safe signal that the stock is going to tank and its time to leave? Or would you say even if 20 MA didn't cross 50 yet but the stock price is below 20 MA but above 50 MA its still means its going to dip?\n\nOr do you use other indicators like RSI and MACD?\n\nSomething like: stock price is below 20 MA, its above 50 MA, but RSI shows overbought and MACD shows bearish momentum so this means leave! Or should I keep it simple and stick to indicators?\n\nPlease would love if someone has experience with these tell me if it worked out for you?\n\nNot only will this help me know when to leave and take my profits but also tells me when to enter, often I see a DD on this sub and jump on the stock like a clown only to bag hold for I don't know how long. I would love to be able to use the MA to tell me its good time to enter or to tell me wait for the dip its overbought just not sure if its possible.\n\nI plan to go through all my losses and look at my entries and try to come up with some sort of perfect time period to try to time what I should have done at that time.",

        "selftext": "I bought some Uber calls. Think the stock got sold off. I\u2019m also long shares.. but I saw that everytime it hits its 200 day MA , tends to jump up. Not a lot of volume in the calls so not a great sign. But I like the stock anyways and pretty volatile so it could be $60 next week... I can\u2019t post the picture of what I\u2019m taking about but if you go to Wsj advanced charting you can see what I\u2019m saying. Just an idea - ps. I usually don\u2019t trust technical analysis, and not the reason I bought it.. I just think $54 is a bargain and should bounce back up to $60- high 50s where it\u2019s been trading lately.",

It wasn't on my radar as it has very low volume which wouldn't trip on my scanner. The way I came about it was because I had to go shopping for shoes and a friend recommended Shoe Carnival to me. Now, I had heard of the company before but never really shopped there and didn't even know it was a public company. I ended up getting a pair of sneakers there for dirt cheap but that wasn't what interested me.*\n\n*I went back home and was curious so I dug up some info on the company and realized it was traded. Being an non-autistic WSBer, I researched the shit out of it the last few days and come to the conclusion that this is a MONSTER squeeze candidate in the making. Just look at the numbers above.*\n\n*With OVER 50% of the available shares shorted, and an extremely low float (only 9.1 million shares available), any major purchase of even a thousand shares is enough to move it like crazy. The bid-ask spread on this the last few days is usually 0.5% or more because of such low liquidity. This tells me that MM's and brokers won't be holding alot of this stock making gigantic moves more likely (ie. don't do market buys/sells!). The last few trading days, the volume that is SHORT is above 10% of the total volume which has been steady. This tells me that there is still a decent amount of short interest here (likely averaging UP) from existing shorts.*\n\n*The earnings themselves beat AND raised. The after hours movement the stock touched $40 but the day after it dropped back down (many factors, $FL reported earnings the morning which disappointed so sympathetic drop, more shorts piling on averaging UP to play a rip-bounce reversal). The stock has seen a temporary rip generally in the mornings of 1-5% after the earnings only to reverse it all. It's been holding steady as I believe it looks to be accumulation. The company also has a buyback program with $19.1 million left on the books. If they were to buy it all back today, it will reduce the float even more (another 500K shares).*\n\n*On their latest earnings conference call, they mention they are well-insulated from tariffs as the majority of their inventory comes from Viet Nam which means no Trump-China BS affecting them (other than weak bagholders causing price to drop on selling).*\n\n*Shoes may not interest the common WSB. But given the numbers shown above, I can see this gapping slowly towards $50 in the next few weeks. This suggests a potential 30% gain in the next month on a relatively safe bet. Be warned though, that because of the low float, the daily movements in this stock may be stomach churning so my advice would be to buy it, forget it. Hell, even set up some buy limit orders that is 1-2% below the price and you may be surprised that you can pick it up on random stop loss picking dips.*\n\n~~I'm personally in this one at an average of 35.88 @ 3400 shares. I have firepower capital to buy another 4600 shares on dips. I will be holding and selling at $50 if it hits. I might sell 34 contracts of covered calls at either $40 or $45 for the Dec 20 monthly to protect myself a bit in case it has a random intraday dip, in which case I buy back the calls for a small discount. Usually, the intraday dip corrects itself quickly and I will probably sell the same number of calls again. Profiting on both dips and rips.~~\n\n\\---------------------------------------\n\nShoutout to [u/cautiouslego](https://www.reddit.com/u/cautiouslego/) for **original post back November 28th,** ***2019*** **15:25:16 GMT**\n\n***109 upvotes atm(will throw in his updates at the bottom for the full story, in the TLDR)***\n\n\\--------------------------------------\n\nIf you want real numbers [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SCVL/key-statistics?p=SCVL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SCVL/key-statistics?p=SCVL) I have no idea what im doing here i just started 2 weeks ago so i don't know any boomer shit.

Hope the non-autists listened to me and got in on that dip. Heck, you can even flip it for a nice **1**\\-2% if you want.\n\n**UPDATE 3 (12/02):** That dip and recovery. I'm like a prophet.\n\n**UPDATE 4 (12/02):** FYI, I bought the dip the last 2 sessions. Average is now at **3**4.97 at 6000 shares. I have 2000 more shares of firepower left (I've also been flipping $35 covered calls on dips and recoveries to reduce my cost basis even more).\n\n**UPDATE 5 (12/03):** So, that dip and recovery happened again right? You autists believe me now? Or you want to keep losing money on garbage plays?\n\n**UPDATE 6 (12/03):** Markets down over **1**%, SHOE FUCKING CARNIVAL GOES GREEN (from 33.87 low dip). Fucking called these daily dips and reversals. What else you autists want????\n\n**UPDATE 7 (12/03):** OK, I just sold 40 $SCVL covered calls as a hedge for tomorrows morning dip. Will buy back those covered calls at a gain before it reverses again. My cost basis has now dropped down to **3**4.**33** at 7000 shares.\n\n**UPDATE 8 (12/04):** Damn, no dip today. It broke its dip and recovery streak so I wasn't able to get my last **1**000 shares. I'm still holding my 7000 shares at **3**4.33 sitting on like $20K GAIN unrealized.\n\n**UPDATE 9 (12/05):** Closed my covered calls for small gain and added my last **1**000 shares at **3**6.28. Cost basis is now at 34.35 8000 shares. 16K unrealized gains.\n\n**UPDATE 10 (12/06):** Still holding my 8000 shares. Nearly $27k unrealized gains now.\n\n**UPDATE 11 (12/06):** As a test, I just tried to sell my 8000 shares at the ASK and the price dropped 20 cents. I cancelled my sell and the price slowly went back up. I think I hold enough shares in this thinly traded stock to actually manipulate the price and fuck around with the MM's ROFLMAO.\n\n**UPDATE 12 (12/09):** Yep, another day, another $**1**0K up unrealized gain. Just waiting for the autistic idiots here to believe me or keep losing money on turd shit like $CRWD, $BYND, **$TSLA**, $ROKU etc.\n\n**UPDATE 13 (12/13):** No major updates the last few days as this has been range bound (and also some profit taking). Thesis still in play, more so now with the tariff Phase 1 deal complete.\n\n**UPDATE 14 (12/16):** Nice little bump today. Consolidated the last week but still in play.\n\n**UPDATE 15 (12/17):** Another little bump but still in consolidation. Will be range bound between high **3**6's and **3**8's for a few days before jumping to 40.\n\n**UPDATE 16 (12/18):** Still rangebound, tiny bump up today.\n\n**UPDATE 17 (12/19):** As expected, still rangebound.\n\n**UPDATE 18 (12/22):** Still within range, will see a bounce to **3**8's this week again.\n\n/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\n\n***TL;DR*** \n\n**Cool story, n*****ice play*** [u/caustiouslego](https://www.reddit.com/u/caustiouslego/)",

        "selftext": "Hey guys. Today I'm sharing a DD on a favorite long hold stock pick, Broadwind Inc. (BWEN).\n\nBroadwind Inc. Company Profile: \n\nBroadwind, Inc. provides products to the energy, mining, and infrastructure sector customers primarily in the United States. It operates through three segments: Heavy Fabrications, Gearing, and Industrial Solutions. The Heavy Fabrications segment provides fabrications to various industrial markets; and steel towers and adapters primarily to wind turbine manufacturers. The Gearing segment offers gearing, and gearboxes and systems for onshore and offshore oil and gas fracking and drilling, surface and underground mining, wind energy, steel, material handling, and other infrastructure markets. The Industrial Solutions segment provides supply chain solutions, inventory management, and kitting and assembly services to natural gas turbine market. The company sells its products through its direct sales force and independent sales agents. \n\nI like this stock and think it will do well for the following reasons: \n\n1) Good Fundamentals\n\nLet's start by taking a look at the companies fundamentals. \n\nMarket Cap: 166.33M\nEnterprise Value: 203.7M\nRevenue: 207.43M \nQuarterly Revenue Growth Rate: 18.4% \nGross Profit: 15.4M\nEBITDA: 9M\nEPS: -0.07\nTotal cash: 4.5M\nTotal Debt: 42M\n\nThe first thing you should notice is that annual revenues are greater than both Market Cap and Enterprise Value. This means that the overall value of company based on its stock price is valued less than the revenue it generates in one year. \n\nIn addition, you will note a quarterly revenue growth rate of 18.4%. This is a decent number, nothing crazy, but gradual and sustainable. If you examine their YoY revenue charts you'll see that this growth has been consistent for several quarters. \n\nThe company is also turning over a gross profit of 15.4M. This can help cover some of the total debt which amounts to 42M. With their current revenue generation I don't expect any short term debt to be an issue that can cause insolvency. Also, over the last year, Broadwind produced more free cash flow than EBIT. \n\nInsiders hold 15% of the company, and institutions hold 45% - another positive sign. \n\nOver the past 4 quarters, the company has matched 2 analyst EPS consensus estimates, and beat 2. \n\nEst. EPS         -0.04   0.02   0.02   -0.06\nActual EPS.   -0.04   0.06   0.03   -0.06\n\n\n2) Experienced Management Team\n\nA company is only as good as the people who operate it, and thus having a solid management team is a key factor. \n\nThe current CEO, Eric Blashford, is a 20 year industry veteran serving in various executive positions. He is an MBA and accounting graduate. \n\nThe CFO, Jason Bonfigt, has been with the company for over 10 years and has an MBA from Kellog School of Business.\n\nThe VP of engineering, Dennis Janda, has been an engineer for over 42 years and graduated with a master's in mechanical engineering from University of Michigan. \n\nThe chairman of the board, Stephanie Kushner, is a 25 year industry veteran with multiple executive positions in her career. She has an MBA in Finance from Wharton.\n\nIn addition to the exec, the company has over 200 employees across the country. They are actively hiring and have several open positions at time of writing. \n\n3) Hot Industry and Diversification \n\nThe company focuses primarily on WIND energy, making this one of the few strong wind plays on the market. While solar has its benefits, wind is considered a superior energy source. It doesn't require sunlight, wind turbines produce less CO2 emissions, and more energy  - one\u00a0wind\u00a0turbine can generate the same amount of electricity per kWh as about 49,000\u00a0solar panels. \n\nWith the Biden administration and Democrat Congress, in addition to Xi Jinpings declaration for China to pivot towards sustainable energy sources, I believe 2021 will be the year when the renewable market really takes off. Broadwind is well positioned to benefit from increased investments, research, and commercialisation in this industry. \n\nIt should be noted that Broadwind derives approximately 30% of revenue from other industries beyond wind power. This includes an industrial gears segment, serving primarily the energy and mining industries and an industrial solutions segment, focused predominantly on gas turbines. This is a goal of management to improve diversification of the business so that they are not hostage to demand wind installations. In fact,\u00a0Broadwinds acquistion of Red Wolf a company supporting gas turbine installations, shows management does wish to actively diversify through what they term their \"revenue diversification initiative\". \n\n4) Price Action and Forecasts \n\nThe company has seen a 400% in its price since last year. While a major run, the company still remains undervalued. Currently, the price is undergoing consolidation and the 1 month and 5 day RSI are in the 45-50 range. Average volumes over the past 1 month have been greater than the overall average by a notable margin. \n\nThe short % is small at about 3.26% of shares outstanding, and has not risen rapidly even with the huge price increase over the past year (a bullish sign).\n\nAnalyst consensus price target is $12.5 with a high of $13, well above its current trading price of 9.98. Consensus recommendation rating is 2.2 (Buy) \n\nEarnings are Forecast to grow 101% per year. \n\nAccording to Simply WallSt. analyses, the stock is trading at 77.9% BELOW it's fair value. \n\n5) Catalysts\n\nA) A number of institutional investors have recently bought and sold shares of the business. Wells Fargo &amp; Company MN boosted its stake in Broadwind by 4,711.8% during the 4th quarter. Russell Investments Group Ltd. acquired a new position in Broadwind during the 4th quarter valued at about $1,263,000. THB Asset Management acquired a new position in Broadwind during the 4th quarter valued at about $1,695,000. Hussman Strategic Advisors Inc. acquired a new stake in shares of Broadwind in the 4th quarter worth approximately $525,000. Finally, Harel Insurance Investments &amp; Financial Services Ltd. acquired a new stake in shares of Broadwind in the 4th quarter worth approximately $128,000.\n\nB) Tax credits for wind projects in the U.S. were extended in 2020.\n\n\"In December 2019, the United States production tax credit for renewable wind projects was extended for one-year, pursuant to a year-end 2019 appropriations bill, from January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2021. As a result of the new legislation, the PTC will subsidize wind projects commenced as late as 2020 and completed by 2024, or later, if continuous construction can be demonstrated\"\n\nThis had led to the company being \"nearly booked\" at full capacity for 2020 for wind tower sections which it reports as part of its \"heavy fabrications\" segment. The company is also at 35% of capacity for 2021, both data points from the November earnings call. Again, as noted above, even though the tax credit ends in a few weeks, per current legislation, projects have until 2024 to complete.\n\n6) Comparables\n\nNextEra Energy Partners Forward 1yr PE ratio: 33\n\nAtlantica Sustainable Infrastructure Forward 1yr PE Ratio: 25.54\n\nBroadwind Inc. Forward 1 yr PE Ratio: 16.3 \n\nCompared to its peers, BWEN could trade at more of a premium to its current valuation. \n\n\n----&gt; Potential Issues/Problems:\n\nBroadwind does have substantial net operating losses (NOLs) of around $14M\n\nNeither Broadwind's ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT nor its level of total liabilities give confidence in its ability to take on more debt.\u00a0\n\nWind tower production is almost maxed out, this may cap earnings growth in 2021 without further expansion. \n\n\n---- Summary ----\n\nBroadwind is a well established clean tech and industrial manufacturing company with a diversfied presence in both renewables and natural gas/oil verticals. It has a solid management team backed by years of experience and prestigious educational qualifications. \n\nBased on an initial assessment of its fundamental metrics, the company appears undervalued with a potential 78% upside. The companies balance sheet remains strong and incoming revenues are significant  with consistent quarterly increases, which should help manage its notable debt.  Market sentiment is somewhat positive at this moment based on analyst price and recommendation consensus. \n\nBroadwind operates in what is likely to be a high growth industry, especially with the prospect of offshore wind in the coming years, and further favorable legislation behind wind and infrastructure projects. \n\nBroadwind appears inexpensive relative to the broader market and trades at a discount to other renewable companies. This could offer substantial futher upside if it matches potential peers. \n\nHowever, production is currently maxed out and pricing power is not apparent. As such, the next leg of price appreciation would be more reliant on re-rating of the valuation and further expansion, which does seem likely in the current market environment and enthusiasm for renewable energy firms.\n\nDisclosure: I am long BWEN. \n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice.
