        "selftext": "I was wondering how people on this sub are not yet talking about EROS or not initiated any position in it. My DD as follows:\n\n**Fundamental:**\n\nAbout the company: EROS is an OTT serving Indian market (popularly called as Netflix of India) with a huge bank of successful Indian films and mature brand recognition amongst Indian diaspora around the world. \n\nSTX Entertainment: Its a medium sized Burbank, CA based Hollywood studio with list of some popular known movies under their hood (Hustlers, Bad Moms etc) .\n\nThese two companies are set to merge on 29th Jun. The combined market cap is projected to well over $2 Billion (a range of $1.8-2.2 Billion figure depending on the source)\n\nEven without going to financial details, EROS is highly undervalued as compared to the size of market it serves and its entrenched relation with Bollywood which even Netflix and Amazon has not been able to crack. This highly lucrative Indian market represents a huge opportunity in terms of ad and movie revenue .\n\nIn short: A very undervalued entry point into 'Indian Netflix'. Even at current price of $3.19, it is avrey good time to get in considering the trajectories of other merger play stocks\n\n**Technical:**\n\nShort volume : Date:    2020-06-22  Short Volume    770,325  Market Volume   2,540,500  **Short Volume Ratio   30%** \n\n**A cup and handle** formation is taking place\n\ntightening Bollinger bands on one week period\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn short, The main upcoming catalyst for a probable pop are:\n\n1. Huge upcoming merger with STX entertainment ( [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200417005565/en/Eros-International-STX-Entertainment-Combine-Creating-Global](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200417005565/en/Eros-International-STX-Entertainment-Combine-Creating-Global) )\n2. Upcoming ER and post-merger guidance as well Ad revenue guidance on post merger entities (unconfirmed date, but most expected at the end of this week)\n3. JP Morgan has a huge share ( [https://fintel.io/sob/us/eros](https://fintel.io/sob/us/eros) )\n\nTLDR:\n\n**A very good chance of minimum 30-40% pop on EROS, also safe for going long**",
