        "selftext": "So I've gone ahead and built a balls on balls deep BB position of 40,000 shares and 800ish contracts.   Been in since November.  \n\nI'm all now a full conviction retard for BB short and long term. BB is going to co-own with Amazon a universal automotive app store (aka IVY). Ivy is going to net billions in profits similar using a model similar to the apple app store. It will get going in 2023 and be a big deal a year after.  It will later expand to planes, boats, trains, space and all IoT.\n\nOn top of that a viable cybersecurity business with a unique AI component business that is going to get its respect very soon.  It's rivals CRWD, FEYE SNOW etc trade at huge multiples.  In 2020 BB hired a stud sales guy from Citrix and he is in process of achieving real wins. Throw in BB IP licensing and patent sales for good measure and you have a diverse business in the hottest spaces in the market.\n\nLast two days up I'm up \\~350k.  Don't care about the fade today, I expected it. Near term we are going to 15, medium term 40ish and beyond that either acquired for 60b or we explode to 100b. \n\nI'm not selling a share until then and will roll all contracts as needed. \n\nBlackberry is on the cusp of being one of the all time great turnaround stories in North American business history.  Forget about stigma from the past when they got crushed by iPhone, that Blackberry doesn't exist any more. WSB is going to be a catalyst for greatness. Let's do this, have no fear.",

        "selftext": "**Disclaimer:** \n\nI am a SWE College Student and not a Financial Analyst. I did this DD because I am passionate about tech and I think investing in tech firms would be a fun hobby in addition to my main job. This is for practice only and not financial advice. Any advice you all can give to improve my analysis would be greatly appreciated! \n\n**Background:**\n\nWhat is Dynatrace? Dynatrace is a product that seeks to track and analyze IT operations. It is an all-in-one product that has features for infrastructure monitoring, application security, business analytics, cloud automation, and more. In practical terms, Dynatrace helps automate DevOps processes, gives business insights, measures how new features are adopted by customers, and helps track vulnerabilities in your software. Here is a youtube demo video:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ihCziAJ07U](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/%22)\n\n**Other Players:**\n\nThe recent field of IT operations monitoring and analytics has seen a raping growth in the number of players. Its competitors include Splunk (IPO Date: 4/18/2012), New Relic (IPO Date: 12/12/2014), Elastic (IPO Date: 10/5/2018), Datadog (IPO Date: 4/19/2019), Sumo Logic (IPO Date: 9/17/2020) among others. Dynatrace is one of the newer players in this space, going public on 8/1/2019. \n\n**The Bull Case:**\n\nPersonally, I believe that Dynatrace is one of the stronger players in this field, and I think that there is a lot of room to grow. The reasons are as follows:  \n\n1. Strong Financials: Over the past year, Dynatrace has consistently beat the consensus EPS estimates by a significant margin. According to MarketBeat, in the most recent Earnings release on 10/28/2020, the consensus EPS estimate was $0.10 and the reported EPS was $0.18, beating the estimate by 80%. Of course, one argument could be that these earnings are inflated by the number of companies switching to technology and the cloud due to the coronavirus, but this trend has started as early as 2019, and in the 10/30/2019 Earnings release, the expected EPS was $0.04 and the reported EPS was $0.06, beating the estimate by 50%. One thing that interested me was that Dynatrace is one of the few software firms that are actually profitable, and has an annual recurring revenue growth rate of around 30%. Other big names in this space, such as Splunk and Datadog, have remained unprofitable by EBIT and GAAP measures respectively. Of course, Datadog\u2019s numbers are deceptive, in that its unprofitability lies in their heavy stock compensation and it has a YOY growth rate of 83%. Dynatrace\u2019s growth numbers do appear weak in comparison, but I believe that this is set to change. According to the Motely Fool, Dynatrace is seeking to grow its sales team by 20-25%. Currently, Dynatrace has a 70% win rate with enterprises they engage with, and if they are able to target more customers, I can see their revenue growth increasing as well. Currently Dynatrace has a market cap of 12.71 billion with a P/E ratio of 160.90. Compared to Datadog, which has a market cap of 31.98 billion with a P/E ratio of 548.84. This makes it seem undervalued in comparison. \n2. Strong Feature Set: I think that Dynatrace measures up to the heavy hitters in the data analytics software field. For example, we have Splunk, a data management and monitoring tool. With Splunk, you store logs and metrics and can create dashboards using the data you have ingested. Dynatrace offers similar features and includes features for the heavy lifting of acquiring the data through monitoring as well. The Dynatrace website has a comparison to Datadog as well. With Datadog, you have the data monitoring service, but you require analysts to interpret the data. Dynatrace offers artificial intelligence to interpret the data and answer questions. This is also just personal preference, but I think the UI is clean and attractive, a well-built product from an engineering perspective. Their tech stack is modern as well, from their job postings and StackShare, I gather they use Typescript, Node.js, React.js with D3.js for their graphing and charting. Honestly, their data visualizations are some of the best I have ever seen.\n3. Customer Sentiment: Dynatrace has a strong base of customers, supporting software and non tech giants as well. Customers include SAP, Citrix, Samsung, Adobe, Ebay, Experian, Abercrombie and Fitch, U-Haul, Porsche, and more. In G2 and Gartner, the product is rated 4.5 stars out of 5 with 973 reviewers and 1210 reviewers respectively. In both sites, competitors are usually rated around the same or lower, usually with much fewer reviews. Overall, I think the general customer consensus is that Dynatrace one of the best products in the market for its specific field.\n4.  Analyst Sentiment: According to MarketWatch, Dynatrace has a low price target of $40, a median price target of $50, and a high price target of $59 dollars. Its current price is $45.18. If analysts are correct about these prices, then we are seeing a potential 11.50% downside in the low price target, a 10.67% upside in the median price target, and a 30.59% upside in the high price target. According to the Wall Street Journal, 17 analysts have given a Buy rating, 2 analysts have given an overweight rating, and 2 analysts have given a Hold Rating. Recent Buy ratings have come from Rosenblatt Securities and Truist Securities. Rosenblatt Securities\u2019 thesis is that Dynatrace is positioned to grow as it expands its total addressable market to $32 billion by breaking into the cloud application security market. Truist Securities\u2019 thesis is that Dynatrace, following its transition to a subscription model is well positioned for substantial growth and profitability into the future. To add to this point, Truist Securities shows that subscription revenue has grown 36% YOY. \n\n**The Bear Case:**\n\nOf course, I think that any stock deserves a healthy bit of skepticism before investing. The most obvious points I can see are:\n\n1.  Crowded Market: The competitors I listed in the Other Players category are just the ones I could immediately think of from the top of my head from recruiting. There are definitely a lot more players and I expect consolidation in this field. After all, who needs 5 different IT monitoring tools? If Dynatrace is unable to innovate fast enough compared to its competitors, I can see this stock price plunging fast. Furthermore, this doesn\u2019t even include the internal processes tech companies use to track and monitor their infrastructure. In other words, there are a lot of players fighting for what may be a smaller number of customers. \n2.  Market Forces: Even with strong earnings numbers, Dynatrace plunged with the market the last time an earnings report came. Earnings occurred 10/28/2020 and Dynatrace\u2019s stock dropped 11% the same day. I assume this is due to uncertainty in the market as it was around the time of election but it is still concerning that it dropped so heavily despite a strong earnings report.\n3. Price: Despite being highly regarded on G2, one of the main complaints that users had were that this product is expensive compared to the competition. Dynatrace may argue that its full feature set is a justification for the price, but if users decide that they don\u2019t need certain features or use other services to compensate, they are likely to go to one of its many competitors. This does not bode well if the market consolidation hypothesis is true, as being a jack of all trades without having a specific niche may actually end up harming Dynatrace in the long run. Another issue I see is that Datadog was able to discover a good niche among small and mid sized companies. Dynatrace's cost may inhibit it from competing with Datadog in that niche. Although perhaps this may not be too large of a concern as they are mostly competing for the world's largest 15,000 global enterprises which can afford the cost.\n\n**Upcoming News:**\n\nThe most important upcoming date is 2/3/2021. Hopefully without another election looming in the future, a strong earnings can push this stock up past its $50 price target. \n\n**Current Positions:** \n\n10 Shares at $46.98. After Apple and Microsoft Earnings, I plan to reinvest the money I have in them to buy more Dynatrace to hopefully bring the total to \\~$1k in preparation for earnings. I\u2019m a poor college student but if I had more to invest I would.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I missed anything or you guys have any feedback I would greatly appreciate it!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Dynatrace \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 18th, 2021.\n\n# **Biden heads into inauguration with a stock market tailwind - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/15/biden-heads-into-inauguration-with-a-stock-market-tailwind.html)**\n*****\n&gt; President-elect Joe Biden moves into the White House in the coming week with the biggest stock market tailwind since a presidential Election Day going back to at least 1952.\n*****\n&gt; According to CFRA data that begins that year, the near 13% gain since Nov. 3 would be the biggest increase in the S&amp;P 500 between the election and inauguration if the gains hold. President John F. Kennedy\u2019s 8.8% gain had been the best, followed by President Dwight Eisenhower, with 6.3%, and President Donald Trump, with 6.2%.\n*****\n&gt; Biden\u2019s promise of the $1.9 trillion relief package he announced Thursday is one of the reasons for the stock market\u2019s surge, and it will be a big focus of markets in the week ahead as investors handicap its chances of winning congressional approval.\n*****\n&gt; The Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday starts off the week, and over the next four days several dozen S&amp;P 500 companies report earnings. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, IBM, Intel and Procter &amp; Gamble are among the companies reporting.\n*****\n&gt; # Biden will have no honeymoon\nThe $1.9 trillion stimulus package is at the top of the agenda. But there is also significant focus on whether his administration will be better at controlling the pandemic and rolling out the vaccine, as he has promised.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis is the number he came in at. Where do negotiations go from here?\u201d Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial, said of the $1.9 trillion package. She pointed to worries about a weakening economy, evident in December\u2019s retail sales data, down a surprising 0.7%, and weekly jobless claims, at the worst level since August.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYou could argue this is Covid-related and therefore what is most important going forward is to see the logistics of the vaccines, inoculations gain orderly momentum. That is crucial for the market,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said the market is focused on the inauguration.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey want to see it go smoothly, and that there\u2019s not any security lapse. The market absorbed the events of Jan. 6. The market looked ahead and figured out that at this point it was a one-off, and the market ended higher on Jan. 6,\u201d she said. \u201cBut always the market becomes much more defensive if what we considered an isolated event suddenly broadens out.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; There will be heightened security surrounding the inauguration after a mob of Trump supporters assaulted the Capitol while Congress was in the process of confirming the Electoral College vote. The House last week voted to impeach Trump for inciting the mob, and now there is concern about further incidents in Washington or at state capitals.\n*****\n&gt; # Stimulus and stocks\nMarkets are also watching carefully to see whether Biden can bridge some of the deep divide between Republicans and Democrats, who now hold a thin majority in Congress.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re getting stimulus, and now the question is \u2018OK, you\u2019re supposed to be this great compromiser,\u2019\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n&gt; Political strategists expect Biden will get his stimulus package but it will be trimmed down. Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James, said the package could be cut to about $1 trillion based on the size previously discussed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and outgoing Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cDoes Congress want to have a bipartisan show of support after what has been an extraordinarily tenuous beginning of this year, to put it mildly?\u201d Mills said. He said the stock market should continue to do well because it is going to get stimulus spending.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cD.C. is going to be there with more spending, or consumers are going to be there with more spending if they have the ability to get to a post-vaccine world sooner,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said that if history is a guide, the stock market should do well with Biden. The average gain of the S&amp;P 500 in the first 100 days for Democratic presidents is 3.5%, going back to 1952. For Republicans in the same period, it\u2019s been an average 0.5%.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has also gained an average 11.3% in the first year of a Democratic president, but just 5.7% for Republicans, going back to World War II.\n*****\n&gt; The stock market will continue to monitor the bond market, after the 10-year Treasury yield reached a high of 1.18% this past week, the highest since March. It since slid back to about 1.08% Friday after the weak data.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOther things are going on in the back room. Bond yields have moved up of late, and it was a change. It gave you a sense of how fast rates can move,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. \u201cIt might be a preview of what you can expect this year.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/NdqXqj3.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/78MvG08.jpg))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/HogqBPe.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/yPgkKR9.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/o6jTeP5.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/7BeafeZ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zGNf0yh.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MhhsYpF.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/yhXOGJz.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1E2Rohq.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/a74UeZP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/a97ysV9.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/skrsU4T.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday Week Trading: Leans Bearish\n\n&gt; Although Martin Luther King Jr. Day was a holiday in many states and cities throughout the U.S. beginning in 1971, it did not become a federal holiday until 1986. Even then it was not observed by the NYSE until 1998. In the 23 years since, the market\u2019s performance during this four-trading-day week has been somewhat lackluster with average weekly performance negative for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000. Average losses range from 0.81% by DJIA to 0.16% by NASDAQ. Of the five indexes, not one has a record better than 50/50. However, since 2012 performance has shown signs of improving. DJIA, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have risen in six of the last nine years. S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have climbed in five of the last eight.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/67df4ce1594bee9748fb885a5316ff07/b5f21cb74511d020-c9/s500x750/218ed920ea1a67d95ff97fd05a5b9bbdf2454805.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Seasonal Soft Patch Ahead Starting Next Week\n\n&gt; With nine trading sessions of the New Year complete, January and 2021 are off to a solid start. DJIA is up 1.26% as of today\u2019s close, S&amp;P 500 stands at 1.05%, NASDAQ 1.74% and small caps, measured by the Russell 2000 are up a whopping 9.14%. These gains all point to and confirm the return of seasonality that we have recently noted.\n\n&gt; Last September was weak as it has historically been, then October exhibited it historical tendency toward volatility while November and December were both positive, in line with typical seasonal patterns. A positive Santa Claus Rally and First Five Days are also encouraging indications that seasonal forces are once again tracking. We expect seasonality will continue to present itself going forward as extraordinary efforts are made to quell the pandemic and return to a pre-Covid, open-for-business, way of life.\n\n&gt; Due to the reemergence of seasonality, we would not be surprised to see some market weakness in the second half of January next week that could persist throughout the rest of January and possible spill over into February. In the following seasonal pattern chart of January, the last 21 years of data for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and 2000 have been plotted with January 2021 through today\u2019s close plotted on the right vertical axis.\n\n&gt; Over the last 21 years, it has been NASDAQ leading at the halfway point, this year it is Russell 2000. Other than that, the major indexes have been tracking their historical patterns fairly well. There was strength early on, followed by sideways action. Should the current trend follow historical patterns then weakness after the eleventh trading day (January 18) is possible.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/c921e48e1e14dd8a61d2ad5cc18d7f94/f775f74bce597bb1-b6/s500x750/409599af0a5ca5a6fbb2ba71a5b1ead87d5852f8.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5 Charts on the Democratic Blue Wave\n\n&gt; One of the top questions we\u2019ve received recently has been what a blue wave may mean for investments. After the Democrats won the two Senate runoff elections in Georgia, they will now control the White House and both chambers of Congress. Our January 11 Market Policy Projections for 2021 gave some of the immediate and longer-term policy impacts of the Democratic \u201cblue wave,\u201d and here we surf the blue wave with some interesting charts.\n\n&gt; First off, blue waves have not been bearish for stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 Index higher 6 of the past 7 times and up a respectable 9.1% on average since 1950.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog-1.15.21-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We shared this chart in 2020, and it shows that historically, stocks do better if an incumbent president wins versus a new president in office. This makes sense, as a new president will bring in new policies and likely question marks\u2014while you know what you will get with a re-elected president. Remember, markets hate uncertainty and surprises.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Econ-blog-1.15.21-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cMake it all nine new Democratic presidents since 1900 to bring with them both the House and the Senate. In fact, stocks do quite well that first year under such circumstances, up nearly 12% on average,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cMaybe investors shouldn\u2019t fear a blue wave after all.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when a new Democratic president has brought with them the House and Senate, stocks gained that first year of their new presidency 6 of 8 times. What stands out to us for 2021, though, is the House majority is only 11\u2014the smallest for a new Democratic president since 1900.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-1.15.21-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Looking at all of the times the Democrats controlled the House (since the 35th Congress when it was Democrats and Republicans), the 11-seat majority is the lowest since 9 seats in 1879. Yes, the Democrats are in power, but this small majority will make it very tough for any of the more extreme policies to pass.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Econ-blog-1.15.21-4.png?ssl=1)**\n\n&gt; Lastly, the Senate is split a perfect 50/50, which is again extremely rare. In the chart below we share the seat difference between the two parties. \u201cA 50/50 Senate coupled with only an 11-seat majority in the House, and it is safe to say we have about as close to a perfectly divided government as we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Detrick.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Econ-blog-1.15.21-5.png?ssl=1)**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Rest of the World Catching Up\n\n&gt; Over the past year, US equities\u2014proxied by the S&amp;P 500 (SPY)\u2014have consistently outperformed global equities more broadly. As shown below, over the past year the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) has risen just over 16%. That compares to 11.26% for the rest of the world as proxied by the Vanguard FTSE All-World ex US ETF (VEU). Breaking that down a bit further by developed and emerging markets, US equities have outpaced both emerging and other developed markets. While emerging markets (SPEM) are right on the heels of the US with just under a 14.78% gain, developed markets (SPDW) have lagged with just a 10.56% gain. So far in 2021, though, the rest of the world has been outperforming the US. Whereas SPY has risen around 1% YTD, VEU is up almost 3 times that. Emerging markets in particular have shown the greatest degree of strength currently having risen 3.87%. Meanwhile, SPDW has gained less (2.7%), though, it is still outperforming the US.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-ETFs.png))**\n\n&gt; In the charts below, we show the ratio of SPY to these other ETFs. A rising line would indicate that the US is outperforming these other measures of global equities while a downward trending line indicates underperformance of SPY. As shown, the longer-term trend has pretty consistently been US outperformance over the past decade but that has faltered at the tail end of 2020 and into 2021. In the case of emerging markets, the line has been on the decline throughout the second half of 2020 as the ratio has hit its lowest level in a year in the past week. The S&amp;P 500's underperformance relative to other developed markets (SPDW) has been more recent as that line peaked in early September but the trend remains the same over the past few months with SPY weaker than global equities more broadly. That is further exemplified by the recent downtrend of SPY versus the All World ex US ETF (VEU).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-RS2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Business Owners Didn't Like the Election Results\n\n&gt; Today's release of the December Small Business Optimism Index from the NFIB saw a large drop as the index dropped from 101.4 to 95.9. After a sharp drop in the wake of the COVID outbreak, the index bounced back nicely but now looks like it's really rolling over.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-NFIB-Small-Business-Chart.png))**\n\n&gt; Not only was this month's headline index weak, but it caught economists completely off guard. While the index fell to 95.9, economists were expecting a drop to 100.2. That 4.3 spread between the actual and expected reading was the biggest miss relative to expectations in more than five years (July 2015) and was the third weakest reading relative to expectations since the December 2012 report.\n\n&gt; Given the big drop in the headline index and the fact that it was so weak relative to expectations, should we be concerned about a double-dip? As an investor, we should always be worried about what could go wrong, but in the case of this report, you can probably wait for further confirmation from other data. The reason for the skepticism is that you could argue that politics plays a role in this report. To illustrate this, we would note that going back to 2010 (as far back as we have data) and right up through Election Day 2016, the NFIB only topped expectations 42% of the time. Following Trump's election in 2016, though, this index surged and has since topped expectations 63% of the time. Since Election Day 2020, though, the headline index has now missed expectations three times.\n\n&gt; From a longer-term perspective, dating back to 1974, the average reading of the NFIB Small Business Index during Republican administrations has been 100.1 while the average level under Democratic Presidents has been 96.2. Now, that would make sense if the economy was also in a recession more often in those periods, but over that same span, even though the percentages are low for both political parties (&lt;20%), the economy has actually been in a recession a higher percentage of the time during Republican administrations than it has in Democratic administrations.\n\n&gt; The lesson to take from all this is that even if it's often hard to separate when it comes to business or investing (or a lot of other aspects of our lives for that matter), it's usually best to leave politics outside.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-NFIB-Small-Business-Survey.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 15th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmx1VYd-S_k))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.17.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NFLX** \n&gt; * **$BAC** \n&gt; * **$FCEL** \n&gt; * **$GS** \n&gt; * **$PG** \n&gt; * **$INTC** \n&gt; * **$SCHW** \n&gt; * **$UNH** \n&gt; * **$MS** \n&gt; * **$HAL** \n&gt; * **$FAST** \n&gt; * **$CMA** \n&gt; * **$STT** \n&gt; * **$ASML** \n&gt; * **$UAL** \n&gt; * **$ONB** \n&gt; * **$IBM** \n&gt; * **$TFC** \n&gt; * **$JBHT** \n&gt; * **$MBWM** \n&gt; * **$CTXS** \n&gt; * **$USB** \n&gt; * **$UNP** \n&gt; * **$ALLY** \n&gt; * **$TRV** \n&gt; * **$BK** \n&gt; * **$AA** \n&gt; * **$LOGI** \n&gt; * **$SLB** \n&gt; * **$ZION** \n&gt; * **$CFG** \n&gt; * **$KEY** \n&gt; * **$FBC** \n&gt; * **$ISRG** \n&gt; * **$IBKR** \n&gt; * **$FHN** \n&gt; * **$BKR** \n&gt; * **$KMI** \n&gt; * **$NTRS** \n&gt; * **$DFS** \n&gt; * **$CSX** \n&gt; * **$EDU** \n&gt; * **$HOMB**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/yhXOGJz.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DAPsqr2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR FINANCIAL COMPANIES ONLY FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/aC5hzkZ.jpg))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR NASDAQ 100 COMPANIES ONLY FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/zIQniHK.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.18.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

Okta's subscription revenues in the 9 months ending 10/31/2020 jumped 50% YoY to $571.2M.\n\n**Financials &amp; Valuations (as of** [10/31/2020](https://investor.okta.com/news-releases/news-release-details/okta-announces-strong-third-quarter-results)**):**\n\n* Current Market Capitalization (as of 1/15/2021) - $32.75B\n* Total Revenue (3 months): $217,379,000\n* Total Revenue (9 months): $600,684,000\n* Net Profit (Loss) \u2013 3 months: ($72,764,000) \u2013 Up from ($63,495,000)\n* Net Profit (Loss) \u2013 9 months: ($190,526,00) \u2013 Up from ($158,441,000)\n* Cash on Hand: $2.945B\n\n**Growth &amp; Opportunities**\n\nOkta is one of the companies that greatly benefited from the lockdowns all over the world, and the subsequent rise in the need for identity and access management services triggered by the  work-from-home wave. The company's momentum will highly likely continue through fiscal 2021 and beyond, with more and more companies looking to ensure safe and secure work-from-home environments that protects companies, their employees and their customers. CFO Bill Losch said on the company's third-quarter [earnings call](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/earnings),  \"We remain confident that the factors that are driving our business today will continue to drive our business well into the future.\"\n\nJust recently, [Okta's products were made available in the AWS Marketplace](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201202005943/en/Okta-and-Amazon-Web-Services-Bring-the-Okta-Identity-Cloud-to-AWS-Marketplace). It is expected that this move will drive top-line growth.\n\nOkta estimates that it will end fiscal 2021 with revenue of about $822.5 million, an increase of 40% from the previous year, and that it will surpass $1 billion in sales in fiscal 2022. Although Okta isn't profitable yet, one of its pro's is that the free cash flow consistently stays on the plus side and makes up 19% of Okta's revenue. One of the most important contracts in this business are annual contracts. Okta gained 100 customers in Q3 with $100,000+ annual contracts, totaling over 1700 customers. The number of large enterprise contracts ($500,000+) grew 50% YoY to 320. These now represent 80% of Okta's annual contract values.\n\nAs president-elect Joe Biden will take office later this week, one of the most anticipated moves is an [increase in cyber security](https://buildbackbetter.gov/press-releases/statement-by-president-elect-joe-biden-on-cybersecurity/) spending by the new administration. Putting Okta, among other big cyber security players, into an excellent playing field the coming years.\n\n**Price Target**\n\nMarch 3 is the expected Q4 earnings. Okta is in a good position to beat their ER once again.\n\n[18 Analysts](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/OKTA/analysis?p=OKTA) combined have an average price target of $262.44.17 (upside of \\~4%) with tops being at $313.\n\n**TL;DR Okta is in a great position within the Identity and Access Management market which makes the company one of the ideal high-growth stocks moving forward. Personally, I think it is worth taking a look at and most likely a stock that will pay off not only when Q4 Earnings are reported, but easily for the next 2 years at least.**",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. Happy New Year! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week, month and year ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 4th, 2021.\n\n# **Politics will be front and center as a catalyst in the first week of the new year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/31/politics-will-be-front-and-center-as-a-catalyst-in-the-first-week-of-the-new-year-.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks exit 2020 with strong gains and are riding a tailwind, but already in the dawn of the new year, the market could face its first big challenge.\n*****\n&gt; The final outcome of the 2020 election plays out Tuesday, when voters in Georgia will pick their senators and decide which party controls the U.S. Senate.\n*****\n&gt; With President-elect Joe Biden heading to the White House and a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, Wall Street has been comfortable with the view that Biden and the Democrats could not succeed with tax hikes and more progressive policy changes while Republicans hold the Senate.\n*****\n&gt; The runoff election for the two Senate seats Tuesday is widely expected to result in one or both of the incumbent Republican senators retaining their seats. But Democrats are close in the polls and should they win, each party would have 50 seats with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the tie breaker.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cGeorgia is the most important thing to the Biden presidency for the next two years,\u201d said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. \u201cIt\u2019s going to determine what is the legislative agenda and who can get confirmed by the United States Senate.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Sen. David Perdue is being challenged by Democrat Jon Ossoff, while GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler is running against Democrat Raphael Warnock. None of the candidates had more than 50% of the vote in the Nov. 3 election, so Georgia law requires a runoff election between the two leading candidates for each seat.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s a binary event,\u201d said Mills, adding it\u2019s of growing interest to markets. \u201cThe general sense for the market is that Republicans are well positioned to maintain their majority in the Senate. But I think the 2020 election as well as the 2016 election and to some extent, the 2018 election has humbled us \u2026 The Senate outcomes, in particular, seem to be less predictable than almost any other elections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Mills said the results may take several days to determine, adding to the uncertainty the event could hold for markets. According to an RBC investor survey, 88% expect Republicans to maintain control, and most say that is a positive for the stock market.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market tends to shoot first and ask questions later. There will certainly be a reaction if Democrats win both those seats,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. Strategists say there could be a relief rally if Republican incumbents see a clear victory.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat totally dominates [trading] because it\u2019s about do we have status quo or do we have Democrats controlling all parts of Washington and what that means for spending and taxes,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI think you could see the worries about taxes overwhelming any thoughts on the benefits of more spending\u201d by Democrats.\n*****\n&gt; # By the numbers\n&gt; A year of extreme volatility ended with a big win for stocks, as the pandemic steered the course for markets. The S&amp;P 500 was up 16.3% for the year, ending at 3,756. That gain comes after a 34% decline early in the year, followed by a powerful more-than 65% rebound. Technology was the big winner for the year, and the Nasdaq was up 43.6% at 12,888.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the runoff vote, the market will be watching a stream of data in the coming week, including the important December jobs report Friday. That could show fewer than 100,000 jobs were added as the spreading virus impacted hiring and layoffs. There were 245,000 jobs created in November.\n*****\n&gt; There is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday, and a number of Fed speakers, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; The virus itself could also be a factor for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; Conventional wisdom for the coming year has been that vaccines will be widely distributed, and by the second half things will start to get back to normal and the economy will pick up. But the initial distribution has been slow, and far short of the 20 million targeted for December by President Donald Trump\u2019s task force.\n*****\n&gt; In that recent RBC survey, three quarters of investors were optimistic about vaccine distribution with 80% expecting a majority to be vaccinated by the end of 2021. \u201cWe suspect that the positive outlook for the stock market and the economy would deteriorate if expectations for a smooth vaccine rollout are not met,\u201d RBC strategists wrote.\n*****\n&gt; They also noted that nearly 60% of the investors surveyed believe high stock market valuations are problematic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis suggests to us that any threat to the economic and earnings recovery story could spark profit-taking. On this point, it is worth noting that the vaccine was the No. 1 issue keeping investors up at night, closely followed by monetary policy and excessive optimism on the recovery,\u201d the strategists noted.\n*****\n&gt; Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, said investors will also be watching the formal acceptance of the Electoral College vote Wednesday. Strategists expect the vote count to confirm Biden\u2019s presidency.\n*****\n&gt; However, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley says he will challenge the certification, and several House Republicans have already vowed to contest the election at that time. If one House member and a senator jointly object to a state\u2019s slate of electors, the two houses of Congress must separately debate and vote on the objection.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists see little chance of any impact on the election outcome, but there could be fireworks. Trump has been claiming since the election that there was fraud but multiple courts failed to find any truth to the claims.\n*****\n&gt; Rupkey said investors are not taking into account enough potential for political risk from the deep animosity between the two political parties.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the additional stimulus and hopes for additional stimulus, and infrastructure spending in 2021, I don\u2019t know that that is such a slam dunk, because of the issue of political instability,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/cAXzkxf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/HnhSggu.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/5egoYkS.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/UlNY0Um.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/z4wSKuc.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/32Ma7rG.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mRJqU8A.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/J7B4Njx.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5udYrpD.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JJmAiwp.png))**\n\n# **Thursday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1ARzFfu.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Why A Year-End Rally Bodes Well For 2021\n\n&gt; Welcome to the last day of 2020! It has been a devastating year in so many ways, yet for investors it has been quite rewarding. Much of the gains in 2020 have taken place the final two months, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up more than 14% in November and December so far, the best end to a year since WWII.\n\n&gt; A big end of year rally could have bulls smiling in 2021. \u201cTurns out a 10% or more gain the final two months of the year has equaled a higher S&amp;P 500 the following year every single time since World War II,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIn fact, January was also higher every single time as well, so maybe this strong rally to end the year is a clue for higher prices into next year.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 gained an average of more than 18% the year following a 10% or more surge during the final two months of the year. Meanwhile, January was up 5 for 5 as well, rising an impressive 3% on average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s what the average year looks like after the prior year gains 10% or more the final two months compared to a typical year. Once again, strong returns are the playbook historically.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog-12.31.20-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We wish everyone a happy and safe New Years Eve and we\u2019ll see you in 2021!\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Fifty to Zero in 283 Days\n\n&gt; In a year with some pretty crazy charts, the one below is right up there with some of the best. After all the markets have been through this year, bot the S&amp;P 500 and Long-Term Treasuries have seen nearly identical returns on a total return basis. That's right, with just a few hours left in the trading year, the S&amp;P 500's total return in 2020 has been a gain of 17.6%, while Long Term US Treasuries, as measured by the B of A Merrill Lynch Long-Term Treasury Index has rallied 17.3%. What makes this nearly identical performance all the more incredible is that on March 23rd, the performance gap between the two was more than 50 percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds.png))**\n\n&gt; The fact that stocks and bonds have essentially seen identical returns this year isn't typical. The chart below shows the annual performance spread between the S&amp;P 500 and long-term US Treasuries going back to 1978. During that time, the S&amp;P 500 has historically outperformed long-term US Treasuries by an average of 3.9 percentage points per year, but the average gap in performance between the two has been over 15 percentage points. In the 43 years since 1978, there have only been seven other years where the performance spread between the two asset classes was less than five percentage points and just two years (1985 and 1992) where the performance spread was less than a percentage point.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds-Annual-Spreads.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Back-to-Back Big Years for Technology\n\n&gt; With just two trading days (including today) left in 2020, the S&amp;P 500 Technology sector is on pace for its second year in a row of rallying more than 40%. Going back to 1990, the only time the Technology sector experienced back-to-back returns of more than 40% was in 1998 and 1999. Back then, not only was the Technology sector up 40%+ in back-to-back years, but it was also up over 75% in both of those years. If you think markets are pretty crazy these days, they still have nothing on the last two years of the 1990s!\n\n&gt; In terms of cumulative returns, the Technology sector is up 210% since the last trading day of 2018, whereas in 1999 it was up 317% in a two-year span. What's also interesting to note about the last 31 years of returns for the Technology sector is how it has only experienced five down years, while the S&amp;P 500 has been down in ten different years during that span. Furthermore, since 2009 there has only been one down year and the decline was a paltry 1.6%. Not a bad 12-year run!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Performance.png))**\n\n&gt; Given that the sector has more than doubled in the last two years, there have been some big individual winners. Topping the list with a gain of just under 400% is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). On the last day of 2018, AMD traded hands for under $20 per share. Today's it's over $90. AMD has a lead of more than 100 percentage points over the next closest stock - NVIDIA (NVDA) - which is up 288%. Interestingly, there aren't a lot of major outliers to the upside compared to the sector's 210% gain, but that's because Apple (AAPL), the sector's largest stock, has paced the sector's gains by rallying more than 240%.\n\n&gt; On the downside, just four stocks in the Technology sector have declined in the last two years. The worst of these has been DXC Technology (DXC) which has lost more than half of its value, while Juniper (JNPR) and HP Enterprise (HPE) are down between 10% and 20%. Lastly, FLIR Systems (FLIR) has declined less than 2%, so depending on how it acts in the next two days, it could move into positive territory just as Intel (INTC) did yesterday after Third Point bailed it out and moved the stock barely into positive territory for the last two years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Growth Dragging on Small Caps\n\n&gt; In the past couple of weeks, we have frequently been keeping tabs on small-cap equities which have been particularly strong performers of late resulting in very overbought readings as well as extended valuations. More specifically, taking a look at growth-oriented small-caps, with only a couple days left in the year small-cap growth stocks\u2014proxied by the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO)\u2014are on pace to have outperformed large-cap equivalents in 2020. On December 10th, IWO surpassed the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) in terms of YTD performance, and even after pulling back in the past week, IWO is still in the lead.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large1.png))**\n\n&gt; As a result of recent moves, there has been a sharp reversal on a relative basis between the two ETFs in the past week. In the chart below, we show the ratio of the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) versus the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). This ratio took off beginning in the early fall meaning small-cap growth drastically outperformed large-cap growth. But the former's weakness in the past several days has put a halt to that move.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large2.png))**\n\n&gt; As to just how sharp of a reversal this was, in the five days through yesterday's close, the decline in the ratio of IWO to IVW was the largest since June. Before that, April and March saw declines that were even larger. Not only was this one of the biggest drops in the relative performance of small-cap growth to large-cap growth in the past few months, but that also stands in the bottom 0.5% of all readings going back to 2000 when the ETF first began trading. Outside of this past spring, the only other periods that have also experienced this type of underperformance of small-cap growth relative to large-cap growth was at various points in 2011, 2008, and a handful of times in the early 2000s.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large3.png))**\n\n&gt; Small-cap underperformance has not necessarily been broad though. For value stocks, small caps (IWN) have generally outperformed large caps (IVE) for the entirety of the new bull market.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week, month and year ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 4th, 2021.\n\n# **Politics will be front and center as a catalyst in the first week of the new year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/31/politics-will-be-front-and-center-as-a-catalyst-in-the-first-week-of-the-new-year-.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks exit 2020 with strong gains and are riding a tailwind, but already in the dawn of the new year, the market could face its first big challenge.\n*****\n&gt; The final outcome of the 2020 election plays out Tuesday, when voters in Georgia will pick their senators and decide which party controls the U.S. Senate.\n*****\n&gt; With President-elect Joe Biden heading to the White House and a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, Wall Street has been comfortable with the view that Biden and the Democrats could not succeed with tax hikes and more progressive policy changes while Republicans hold the Senate.\n*****\n&gt; The runoff election for the two Senate seats Tuesday is widely expected to result in one or both of the incumbent Republican senators retaining their seats. But Democrats are close in the polls and should they win, each party would have 50 seats with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the tie breaker.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cGeorgia is the most important thing to the Biden presidency for the next two years,\u201d said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. \u201cIt\u2019s going to determine what is the legislative agenda and who can get confirmed by the United States Senate.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Sen. David Perdue is being challenged by Democrat Jon Ossoff, while GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler is running against Democrat Raphael Warnock. None of the candidates had more than 50% of the vote in the Nov. 3 election, so Georgia law requires a runoff election between the two leading candidates for each seat.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s a binary event,\u201d said Mills, adding it\u2019s of growing interest to markets. \u201cThe general sense for the market is that Republicans are well positioned to maintain their majority in the Senate. But I think the 2020 election as well as the 2016 election and to some extent, the 2018 election has humbled us \u2026 The Senate outcomes, in particular, seem to be less predictable than almost any other elections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Mills said the results may take several days to determine, adding to the uncertainty the event could hold for markets. According to an RBC investor survey, 88% expect Republicans to maintain control, and most say that is a positive for the stock market.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market tends to shoot first and ask questions later. There will certainly be a reaction if Democrats win both those seats,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. Strategists say there could be a relief rally if Republican incumbents see a clear victory.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat totally dominates [trading] because it\u2019s about do we have status quo or do we have Democrats controlling all parts of Washington and what that means for spending and taxes,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI think you could see the worries about taxes overwhelming any thoughts on the benefits of more spending\u201d by Democrats.\n*****\n&gt; # By the numbers\n&gt; A year of extreme volatility ended with a big win for stocks, as the pandemic steered the course for markets. The S&amp;P 500 was up 16.3% for the year, ending at 3,756. That gain comes after a 34% decline early in the year, followed by a powerful more-than 65% rebound. Technology was the big winner for the year, and the Nasdaq was up 43.6% at 12,888.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the runoff vote, the market will be watching a stream of data in the coming week, including the important December jobs report Friday. That could show fewer than 100,000 jobs were added as the spreading virus impacted hiring and layoffs. There were 245,000 jobs created in November.\n*****\n&gt; There is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday, and a number of Fed speakers, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; The virus itself could also be a factor for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; Conventional wisdom for the coming year has been that vaccines will be widely distributed, and by the second half things will start to get back to normal and the economy will pick up. But the initial distribution has been slow, and far short of the 20 million targeted for December by President Donald Trump\u2019s task force.\n*****\n&gt; In that recent RBC survey, three quarters of investors were optimistic about vaccine distribution with 80% expecting a majority to be vaccinated by the end of 2021. \u201cWe suspect that the positive outlook for the stock market and the economy would deteriorate if expectations for a smooth vaccine rollout are not met,\u201d RBC strategists wrote.\n*****\n&gt; They also noted that nearly 60% of the investors surveyed believe high stock market valuations are problematic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis suggests to us that any threat to the economic and earnings recovery story could spark profit-taking. On this point, it is worth noting that the vaccine was the No. 1 issue keeping investors up at night, closely followed by monetary policy and excessive optimism on the recovery,\u201d the strategists noted.\n*****\n&gt; Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, said investors will also be watching the formal acceptance of the Electoral College vote Wednesday. Strategists expect the vote count to confirm Biden\u2019s presidency.\n*****\n&gt; However, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley says he will challenge the certification, and several House Republicans have already vowed to contest the election at that time. If one House member and a senator jointly object to a state\u2019s slate of electors, the two houses of Congress must separately debate and vote on the objection.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists see little chance of any impact on the election outcome, but there could be fireworks.

Much of the gains in 2020 have taken place the final two months, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up more than 14% in November and December so far, the best end to a year since WWII.\n\n&gt; A big end of year rally could have bulls smiling in 2021. \u201cTurns out a 10% or more gain the final two months of the year has equaled a higher S&amp;P 500 the following year every single time since World War II,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIn fact, January was also higher every single time as well, so maybe this strong rally to end the year is a clue for higher prices into next year.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 gained an average of more than 18% the year following a 10% or more surge during the final two months of the year. Meanwhile, January was up 5 for 5 as well, rising an impressive 3% on average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s what the average year looks like after the prior year gains 10% or more the final two months compared to a typical year. Once again, strong returns are the playbook historically.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog-12.31.20-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We wish everyone a happy and safe New Years Eve and we\u2019ll see you in 2021!\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Fifty to Zero in 283 Days\n\n&gt; In a year with some pretty crazy charts, the one below is right up there with some of the best. After all the markets have been through this year, bot the S&amp;P 500 and Long-Term Treasuries have seen nearly identical returns on a total return basis. That's right, with just a few hours left in the trading year, the S&amp;P 500's total return in 2020 has been a gain of 17.6%, while Long Term US Treasuries, as measured by the B of A Merrill Lynch Long-Term Treasury Index has rallied 17.3%. What makes this nearly identical performance all the more incredible is that on March 23rd, the performance gap between the two was more than 50 percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds.png))**\n\n&gt; The fact that stocks and bonds have essentially seen identical returns this year isn't typical. The chart below shows the annual performance spread between the S&amp;P 500 and long-term US Treasuries going back to 1978. During that time, the S&amp;P 500 has historically outperformed long-term US Treasuries by an average of 3.9 percentage points per year, but the average gap in performance between the two has been over 15 percentage points. In the 43 years since 1978, there have only been seven other years where the performance spread between the two asset classes was less than five percentage points and just two years (1985 and 1992) where the performance spread was less than a percentage point.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds-Annual-Spreads.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Back-to-Back Big Years for Technology\n\n&gt; With just two trading days (including today) left in 2020, the S&amp;P 500 Technology sector is on pace for its second year in a row of rallying more than 40%. Going back to 1990, the only time the Technology sector experienced back-to-back returns of more than 40% was in 1998 and 1999. Back then, not only was the Technology sector up 40%+ in back-to-back years, but it was also up over 75% in both of those years. If you think markets are pretty crazy these days, they still have nothing on the last two years of the 1990s!\n\n&gt; In terms of cumulative returns, the Technology sector is up 210% since the last trading day of 2018, whereas in 1999 it was up 317% in a two-year span. What's also interesting to note about the last 31 years of returns for the Technology sector is how it has only experienced five down years, while the S&amp;P 500 has been down in ten different years during that span. Furthermore, since 2009 there has only been one down year and the decline was a paltry 1.6%. Not a bad 12-year run!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Performance.png))**\n\n&gt; Given that the sector has more than doubled in the last two years, there have been some big individual winners. Topping the list with a gain of just under 400% is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). On the last day of 2018, AMD traded hands for under $20 per share. Today's it's over $90. AMD has a lead of more than 100 percentage points over the next closest stock - NVIDIA (NVDA) - which is up 288%. Interestingly, there aren't a lot of major outliers to the upside compared to the sector's 210% gain, but that's because Apple (AAPL), the sector's largest stock, has paced the sector's gains by rallying more than 240%.\n\n&gt; On the downside, just four stocks in the Technology sector have declined in the last two years. The worst of these has been DXC Technology (DXC) which has lost more than half of its value, while Juniper (JNPR) and HP Enterprise (HPE) are down between 10% and 20%. Lastly, FLIR Systems (FLIR) has declined less than 2%, so depending on how it acts in the next two days, it could move into positive territory just as Intel (INTC) did yesterday after Third Point bailed it out and moved the stock barely into positive territory for the last two years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Growth Dragging on Small Caps\n\n&gt; In the past couple of weeks, we have frequently been keeping tabs on small-cap equities which have been particularly strong performers of late resulting in very overbought readings as well as extended valuations. More specifically, taking a look at growth-oriented small-caps, with only a couple days left in the year small-cap growth stocks\u2014proxied by the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO)\u2014are on pace to have outperformed large-cap equivalents in 2020. On December 10th, IWO surpassed the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) in terms of YTD performance, and even after pulling back in the past week, IWO is still in the lead.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large1.png))**\n\n&gt; As a result of recent moves, there has been a sharp reversal on a relative basis between the two ETFs in the past week. In the chart below, we show the ratio of the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) versus the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). This ratio took off beginning in the early fall meaning small-cap growth drastically outperformed large-cap growth. But the former's weakness in the past several days has put a halt to that move.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large2.png))**\n\n&gt; As to just how sharp of a reversal this was, in the five days through yesterday's close, the decline in the ratio of IWO to IVW was the largest since June. Before that, April and March saw declines that were even larger. Not only was this one of the biggest drops in the relative performance of small-cap growth to large-cap growth in the past few months, but that also stands in the bottom 0.5% of all readings going back to 2000 when the ETF first began trading. Outside of this past spring, the only other periods that have also experienced this type of underperformance of small-cap growth relative to large-cap growth was at various points in 2011, 2008, and a handful of times in the early 2000s.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large3.png))**\n\n&gt; Small-cap underperformance has not necessarily been broad though. For value stocks, small caps (IWN) have generally outperformed large caps (IVE) for the entirety of the new bull market. While there was a bit of a turn lower in recent days, it has been nowhere close to as dramatic of a move as growth stocks.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large4.png))**\n\n&gt; In the charts below, we show average performance over the past week of Russell 2000 stocks broken into deciles based on their price to sales and price to book ratios. As shown, the most aggressively valued deciles have averaged the worst performance in the past week. Stocks with low P/S and P/B ratios have not been immune from the weakness, but they have held up significantly better.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-RTY-Decile.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending December 31st, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFRABTKrDl8))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.3.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prYPiK171zk))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$MU** \n&gt; * **$BBBY** \n&gt; * **$SMPL** \n&gt; * **$WBA** \n&gt; * **$STZ** \n&gt; * **$RPM** \n&gt; * **$MSM** \n&gt; * **$CAG** \n&gt; * **$UNF** \n&gt; * **$HELE** \n&gt; * **$ANGO** \n&gt; * **$SGH** \n&gt; * **$AYI** \n&gt; * **$REVG** \n&gt; * **$LW** \n&gt; * **$WDFC** \n&gt; * **$LNN** \n&gt; * **$LNDC** \n&gt; * **$SAR** \n&gt; * **$RGP** \n&gt; * **$GBX** \n&gt; * **$ACCD** \n&gt; * **$DCT** \n&gt; * **$FC** \n&gt; * **$NTIC** \n&gt; * **$SCHN**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/5udYrpD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/hQIRBYI.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.4.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.4.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  1.5.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZAbC0jw.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.5.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wKzyMxp.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.6.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BUFtffd.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.6.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cDQHHqx.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.7.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NhUT413.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.7.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7p03h4M.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.8.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.8.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Micron Technology, Inc. $75.18\n**Micron Technology, Inc.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week, month and year ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 4th, 2021.\n\n# **Politics will be front and center as a catalyst in the first week of the new year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/31/politics-will-be-front-and-center-as-a-catalyst-in-the-first-week-of-the-new-year-.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks exit 2020 with strong gains and are riding a tailwind, but already in the dawn of the new year, the market could face its first big challenge.\n*****\n&gt; The final outcome of the 2020 election plays out Tuesday, when voters in Georgia will pick their senators and decide which party controls the U.S. Senate.\n*****\n&gt; With President-elect Joe Biden heading to the White House and a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, Wall Street has been comfortable with the view that Biden and the Democrats could not succeed with tax hikes and more progressive policy changes while Republicans hold the Senate.\n*****\n&gt; The runoff election for the two Senate seats Tuesday is widely expected to result in one or both of the incumbent Republican senators retaining their seats. But Democrats are close in the polls and should they win, each party would have 50 seats with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the tie breaker.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cGeorgia is the most important thing to the Biden presidency for the next two years,\u201d said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. \u201cIt\u2019s going to determine what is the legislative agenda and who can get confirmed by the United States Senate.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Sen. David Perdue is being challenged by Democrat Jon Ossoff, while GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler is running against Democrat Raphael Warnock. None of the candidates had more than 50% of the vote in the Nov. 3 election, so Georgia law requires a runoff election between the two leading candidates for each seat.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s a binary event,\u201d said Mills, adding it\u2019s of growing interest to markets. \u201cThe general sense for the market is that Republicans are well positioned to maintain their majority in the Senate. But I think the 2020 election as well as the 2016 election and to some extent, the 2018 election has humbled us \u2026 The Senate outcomes, in particular, seem to be less predictable than almost any other elections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Mills said the results may take several days to determine, adding to the uncertainty the event could hold for markets. According to an RBC investor survey, 88% expect Republicans to maintain control, and most say that is a positive for the stock market.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market tends to shoot first and ask questions later. There will certainly be a reaction if Democrats win both those seats,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. Strategists say there could be a relief rally if Republican incumbents see a clear victory.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat totally dominates [trading] because it\u2019s about do we have status quo or do we have Democrats controlling all parts of Washington and what that means for spending and taxes,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI think you could see the worries about taxes overwhelming any thoughts on the benefits of more spending\u201d by Democrats.\n*****\n&gt; # By the numbers\n&gt; A year of extreme volatility ended with a big win for stocks, as the pandemic steered the course for markets. The S&amp;P 500 was up 16.3% for the year, ending at 3,756. That gain comes after a 34% decline early in the year, followed by a powerful more-than 65% rebound. Technology was the big winner for the year, and the Nasdaq was up 43.6% at 12,888.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the runoff vote, the market will be watching a stream of data in the coming week, including the important December jobs report Friday. That could show fewer than 100,000 jobs were added as the spreading virus impacted hiring and layoffs. There were 245,000 jobs created in November.\n*****\n&gt; There is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday, and a number of Fed speakers, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; The virus itself could also be a factor for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; Conventional wisdom for the coming year has been that vaccines will be widely distributed, and by the second half things will start to get back to normal and the economy will pick up. But the initial distribution has been slow, and far short of the 20 million targeted for December by President Donald Trump\u2019s task force.\n*****\n&gt; In that recent RBC survey, three quarters of investors were optimistic about vaccine distribution with 80% expecting a majority to be vaccinated by the end of 2021. \u201cWe suspect that the positive outlook for the stock market and the economy would deteriorate if expectations for a smooth vaccine rollout are not met,\u201d RBC strategists wrote.\n*****\n&gt; They also noted that nearly 60% of the investors surveyed believe high stock market valuations are problematic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis suggests to us that any threat to the economic and earnings recovery story could spark profit-taking. On this point, it is worth noting that the vaccine was the No. 1 issue keeping investors up at night, closely followed by monetary policy and excessive optimism on the recovery,\u201d the strategists noted.\n*****\n&gt; Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, said investors will also be watching the formal acceptance of the Electoral College vote Wednesday. Strategists expect the vote count to confirm Biden\u2019s presidency.\n*****\n&gt; However, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley says he will challenge the certification, and several House Republicans have already vowed to contest the election at that time. If one House member and a senator jointly object to a state\u2019s slate of electors, the two houses of Congress must separately debate and vote on the objection.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists see little chance of any impact on the election outcome, but there could be fireworks. Trump has been claiming since the election that there was fraud but multiple courts failed to find any truth to the claims.\n*****\n&gt; Rupkey said investors are not taking into account enough potential for political risk from the deep animosity between the two political parties.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the additional stimulus and hopes for additional stimulus, and infrastructure spending in 2021, I don\u2019t know that that is such a slam dunk, because of the issue of political instability,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/cAXzkxf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/HnhSggu.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/5egoYkS.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/UlNY0Um.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/z4wSKuc.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/32Ma7rG.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mRJqU8A.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/J7B4Njx.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5udYrpD.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JJmAiwp.png))**\n\n# **Thursday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1ARzFfu.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Why A Year-End Rally Bodes Well For 2021\n\n&gt; Welcome to the last day of 2020! It has been a devastating year in so many ways, yet for investors it has been quite rewarding. Much of the gains in 2020 have taken place the final two months, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up more than 14% in November and December so far, the best end to a year since WWII.\n\n&gt; A big end of year rally could have bulls smiling in 2021. \u201cTurns out a 10% or more gain the final two months of the year has equaled a higher S&amp;P 500 the following year every single time since World War II,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIn fact, January was also higher every single time as well, so maybe this strong rally to end the year is a clue for higher prices into next year.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 gained an average of more than 18% the year following a 10% or more surge during the final two months of the year. Meanwhile, January was up 5 for 5 as well, rising an impressive 3% on average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s what the average year looks like after the prior year gains 10% or more the final two months compared to a typical year. Once again, strong returns are the playbook historically.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog-12.31.20-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We wish everyone a happy and safe New Years Eve and we\u2019ll see you in 2021!\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Fifty to Zero in 283 Days\n\n&gt; In a year with some pretty crazy charts, the one below is right up there with some of the best. After all the markets have been through this year, bot the S&amp;P 500 and Long-Term Treasuries have seen nearly identical returns on a total return basis. That's right, with just a few hours left in the trading year, the S&amp;P 500's total return in 2020 has been a gain of 17.6%, while Long Term US Treasuries, as measured by the B of A Merrill Lynch Long-Term Treasury Index has rallied 17.3%. What makes this nearly identical performance all the more incredible is that on March 23rd, the performance gap between the two was more than 50 percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds.png))**\n\n&gt; The fact that stocks and bonds have essentially seen identical returns this year isn't typical. The chart below shows the annual performance spread between the S&amp;P 500 and long-term US Treasuries going back to 1978. During that time, the S&amp;P 500 has historically outperformed long-term US Treasuries by an average of 3.9 percentage points per year, but the average gap in performance between the two has been over 15 percentage points. In the 43 years since 1978, there have only been seven other years where the performance spread between the two asset classes was less than five percentage points and just two years (1985 and 1992) where the performance spread was less than a percentage point.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds-Annual-Spreads.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Back-to-Back Big Years for Technology\n\n&gt; With just two trading days (including today) left in 2020, the S&amp;P 500 Technology sector is on pace for its second year in a row of rallying more than 40%. Going back to 1990, the only time the Technology sector experienced back-to-back returns of more than 40% was in 1998 and 1999. Back then, not only was the Technology sector up 40%+ in back-to-back years, but it was also up over 75% in both of those years. If you think markets are pretty crazy these days, they still have nothing on the last two years of the 1990s!\n\n&gt; In terms of cumulative returns, the Technology sector is up 210% since the last trading day of 2018, whereas in 1999 it was up 317% in a two-year span. What's also interesting to note about the last 31 years of returns for the Technology sector is how it has only experienced five down years, while the S&amp;P 500 has been down in ten different years during that span. Furthermore, since 2009 there has only been one down year and the decline was a paltry 1.6%. Not a bad 12-year run!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Performance.png))**\n\n&gt; Given that the sector has more than doubled in the last two years, there have been some big individual winners. Topping the list with a gain of just under 400% is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). On the last day of 2018, AMD traded hands for under $20 per share. Today's it's over $90. AMD has a lead of more than 100 percentage points over the next closest stock - NVIDIA (NVDA) - which is up 288%. Interestingly, there aren't a lot of major outliers to the upside compared to the sector's 210% gain, but that's because Apple (AAPL), the sector's largest stock, has paced the sector's gains by rallying more than 240%.\n\n&gt; On the downside, just four stocks in the Technology sector have declined in the last two years. The worst of these has been DXC Technology (DXC) which has lost more than half of its value, while Juniper (JNPR) and HP Enterprise (HPE) are down between 10% and 20%. Lastly, FLIR Systems (FLIR) has declined less than 2%, so depending on how it acts in the next two days, it could move into positive territory just as Intel (INTC) did yesterday after Third Point bailed it out and moved the stock barely into positive territory for the last two years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Growth Dragging on Small Caps\n\n&gt; In the past couple of weeks, we have frequently been keeping tabs on small-cap equities which have been particularly strong performers of late resulting in very overbought readings as well as extended valuations. More specifically, taking a look at growth-oriented small-caps, with only a couple days left in the year small-cap growth stocks\u2014proxied by the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO)\u2014are on pace to have outperformed large-cap equivalents in 2020. On December 10th, IWO surpassed the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) in terms of YTD performance, and even after pulling back in the past week, IWO is still in the lead.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large1.png))**\n\n&gt; As a result of recent moves, there has been a sharp reversal on a relative basis between the two ETFs in the past week. In the chart below, we show the ratio of the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) versus the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). This ratio took off beginning in the early fall meaning small-cap growth drastically outperformed large-cap growth. But the former's weakness in the past several days has put a halt to that move.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large2.png))**\n\n&gt; As to just how sharp of a reversal this was, in the five days through yesterday's close, the decline in the ratio of IWO to IVW was the largest since June. Before that, April and March saw declines that were even larger. Not only was this one of the biggest drops in the relative performance of small-cap growth to large-cap growth in the past few months, but that also stands in the bottom 0.5% of all readings going back to 2000 when the ETF first began trading. Outside of this past spring, the only other periods that have also experienced this type of underperformance of small-cap growth relative to large-cap growth was at various points in 2011, 2008, and a handful of times in the early 2000s.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large3.png))**\n\n&gt; Small-cap underperformance has not necessarily been broad though. For value stocks, small caps (IWN) have generally outperformed large caps (IVE) for the entirety of the new bull market. While there was a bit of a turn lower in recent days, it has been nowhere close to as dramatic of a move as growth stocks.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large4.png))**\n\n&gt; In the charts below, we show average performance over the past week of Russell 2000 stocks broken into deciles based on their price to sales and price to book ratios. As shown, the most aggressively valued deciles have averaged the worst performance in the past week. Stocks with low P/S and P/B ratios have not been immune from the weakness, but they have held up significantly better.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-RTY-Decile.png))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/5udYrpD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/hQIRBYI.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.4.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.4.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  1.5.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZAbC0jw.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.5.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wKzyMxp.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.6.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BUFtffd.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.6.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cDQHHqx.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.7.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NhUT413.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.7.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7p03h4M.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.8.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.8.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Micron Technology, Inc. $75.18\n**Micron Technology, Inc.

        "selftext": "**Industry Overview**\n\nFinancial institutions are known for their lackluster online/digital experience. Many processes inside of these companies are done manually with paper and can take weeks to process and receive approval. Financial institutions are one of the most risk-averse sets of customers.\n\nBanks and other financial institutions will always be around. Although these companies may look different from today, this industry will always be around. That\u2019s why Buffett invests in banks. As cloud software and the regulatory burden becomes more expensive and time-consuming, financial institutions are looking to improve their processes to be more efficient and please customers.\n\nSimple processes can drag on for weeks in financial institutions. Cloud software, nCino, and nCino\u2019s competitors are helping solve this problem. nCino aims to change these manual processes and make financial institutions more nimble while still being compliant with all regulations.\n\nAccording to Gartner, banking had the highest global enterprise IT spending of all industries with approximately $376 billion spent in 2018. Although nCino only defines its serviceable addressable market at $10bn, the broader IT industry gives nCino a long runway of future potential growth.\n\nnCino has a number of competitors. My initial research shows that nCino competes with Fiserv, Oracle, and other small companies. In order to invest in nCino, a deeper look into the competitive environment will need to be completed.\n\n**Business Overview**\n\nnCino was founded in 2012 by a team of bankers. These founders built a software company solving problems for banks. The founders knew the struggles that often occur inside banks and used their knowledge to solve these problems. nCino is a bank operating system platform. It helps provide banks onboard, originate loans, open accounts, and many other processes. The CEO stated in an interview that \u201che wants the software to do everything from operations, ranging from treasury management to mortgages (coming soon), to tracking employees\u2019 efficiency.\u201d nCino already has relationships with over 305 financial institutions that use the nCino bank operating system, which is their main platform, and then nCino has another 920 financial institutions that use the portfolio analytics solution tool that was acquired in the acquisition of Visible Equity.\n\nnCino has already signed some of the largest financial institutions in the world. nCino boasts Bank of America, Barclays, TD Bank, and many regional community banks, credit unions, and challenger banks as customers.\n\nnCino sells its software on a per-seat basis. This gives it room to continue to expand within its existing customer base. nCino also stands to benefit from capturing more financial institutional clients and expanding their average contract value.  \\`\n\nHere is a list of nCino\u2019s offerings: loan origination, portfolio analytics, compliance and risk management, digital customer engagement, customer relationship management (CRM), client onboarding, deposit account opening, business process automation, and enterprise content management.\n\n**Total Addressable Market**\n\nnCino\u2019s S-1 touts that there are more than 28,000 financial institutions worldwide. Gartner also lists banking as the industry with the highest global enterprise IT spending with approximately $376 billion spent in 2018. The financial industry is one of the largest industries and if nCino can help power even a sliver of this industry, it will be a good future for this company. Of course, I have to caveat this by saying that starting a t-shirt business and capturing 1% of the apparel industry may seem plausible, but it is impossible. I make this statement because nCino already has a strong base of customers and has done the work to capture this pie. This gives it the possibility to capture more market share, not all of it, but more.\n\nThe bull thesis for nCino is to be the main software operating system for banks. As banks become more reliant on technology, nCino will prove to be a critical piece of infrastructure. nCino will also develop more product offerings that help their customers. This enhances the stickiness of nCino and leads to upsell opportunities.\n\nnCino\u2019s management team lists the total serviceable market for nCino\u2019s bank operating system at more than $10bn. I believe this is within reason and management is likely underestimating (on purpose or not) the addressable market they believe they can capture.\n\n**Competitive Advantages**\n\nAlthough I like to be optimistic about companies when researching them, I do think nCino is quite an attractive company based on my research on the qualitative aspects of the business.\n\n* **Mission-critical product with high switching costs.**\n   * The solutions that nCino provides are for mission-critical processes that banks want to be done right. Financial institutions would rather have a manual time-consuming process than an automatic process that goes wrong. Switching costs come into play once customers are comfortable with nCino\u2019s product. As customers rely more and more on nCino, these customers are unlikely to switch.Switching from nCino (or any company) to a competitor may lead to outages, issues, and lots of problems that financial institutions will not risk having to deal with. Even if financial institutions attempt to build out their own bank operating system, it will be costly, prone to error, and not worth it! That\u2019s like trying to build out Stripe if you\u2019re an e-commerce company (@Shopify). Allocating capital to build out this function will make zero sense for financial institutions. It\u2019s better to stick to what you know and what you\u2019re good at. That\u2019s why nCino will have high switching costs.\n* **Economies of scale.**\n   * The cost of building out a suite of software products and deploying it to a large customer base is much cheaper for a large company than a small company. Just like no startup would try and compete directly with Amazon, Shopify, Salesforce, Stripe, etc, as nCino grows, no company will come close to competing in the same fashion due to their scale benefits.As nCino looks to expand its product offering, the attractiveness of nCino\u2019s products to financial institutions will only grow. Financial institutions, a very risk-averse set of customers, want products that have been vetted by other financial institutions and have offerings that solve critical problems.\n\n**Financials**\n\nLike many SaaS companies, nCino has two primary revenue lines. The first is recurring revenue similar to most SaaS companies. The second revenue source is professional services revenue. Subscription revenue accounts for the majority of revenue and gross profit.\n\n**January 2020:**\n\nTotal revenue = \\~$138mn\n\nGAAP Gross profit = \\~$74mn\n\nSubscription revenue = \\~$103mn\n\nSubscription revenue growth = \\~60%\n\nSubscription gross profit margin = \\~70%\n\nGAAP EBIT margin = -20%\n\n**January 2019:**\n\nTotal revenue = \\~$92mn\n\nGAAP Gross profit = \\~$45mn\n\nSubscription revenue = \\~$64mn\n\nSubscription revenue growth = \\~69%\n\nSubscription gross profit margin = \\~69%\n\nGAAP EBIT margin = -25%\n\n**January 2018:**\n\nTotal revenue = \\~$58mn\n\nGAAP Gross profit = \\~$28mn\n\nSubscription revenue = \\~$38mn\n\nSubscription revenue growth = N/A\n\nSubscription gross profit margin = \\~67%\n\nGAAP EBIT margin = -32%\n\nAlthough nCino is not profitable on a GAAP basis like many of its software peers, the attractiveness of the growth story is compelling. More research into unit economics may provide an even more compelling story.\n\n**What\u2019s Interesting**\n\nThe financial industry is a risk-averse industry and usually, one of the last industries to adapt to change. This is changing with the increasing adoption of technology and software. The innovation occurring in FinTech and in financial institutions is growing. If nCino can be one of the main companies to be the operating system for banks (just like Microsoft/Salesforce is to most companies) then nCino may be an attractive investment opportunity.\n\nSalesforce also owns a large portion of nCino. nCino relies on the \u201cSalesforce Platform.\u201d Also, this may initially seem like a concern, Salesforce also owns 11.6% of nCino. It wouldn\u2019t make much sense for Salesforce to stop nCino from using the Salesforce Platform if they own such a material stake in the company.\n\nSome of the hedge funds that I follow ([Link](https://twitter.com/StratusYoung/status/1327453755583893505)) have positions in nCino which is what initially attracted me to this business. Hedge funds like Dragoneer, Tiger Global, and Durable Capital have a position in nCino. Sure these positions may just be small positions to take advantage of the tech IPO pop, but future quarters will show if this is a long-term position for these funds.\n\n**Future Questions**\n\n* **Competition**\n   * In order to be more confident in nCino, I\u2019d have to know more about the banking industry and the various competitors and similar nCino product offerings. Through my research, I found some competitors, but little to no information on these companies because they are private or are just not in the typical VC crowd.I also am not sure how hard it would be for Salesforce, Microsoft, or another well-funded company to try and launch similar product offerings to nCino. It seems from first glance that nCino has a strong suite of products, but not sure if this is something they\u2019ve built over time or is from the founders\u2019 background in banking. I doubt Salesforce would try and compete directly with nCino but may form some type of ongoing partnership.\n* **Ownership**\n   * I like to see management teams with large ownership stakes in the businesses they run. With nCino, I don\u2019t see a large ownership stake. Although there were a number of founders and thus each founder has a small stake in nCino, the largest positions by far are owned by Insight Partners, Salesforce, and Wellington. I will need to do more research on digging into the ownership structure and see whether or not management is being incentivized alongside public investors.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI think nCino is a strong company and in my opinion, it\u2019s one of the more attractive investment opportunities from the companies I\u2019ve outlined in the past. The financial industry is huge and if nCino can continue to innovate, build products, upsell existing customers, and sign contracts with new customers, I think nCino may be a stock that people will be talking about in 3-5 years.\n\nIt\u2019s had very strong growth thus far and likely will continue. Of course, the valuation is a key point with some concerns over the high multiple, but relative to similar high growth/high margin comparable companies, nCino fits into this bucket.",

It seems from first glance that nCino has a strong suite of products, but not sure if this is something they\u2019ve built over time or is from the founders\u2019 background in banking.

        "selftext": "**Industry Overview**\n\nFinancial institutions are known for their lackluster online/digital experience. Many processes inside of these companies are done manually with paper and can take weeks to process and receive approval. Financial institutions are one of the most risk-averse sets of customers.\n\nBanks and other financial institutions will always be around. Although these companies may look different from today, this industry will always be around. That\u2019s why Buffett invests in banks. As cloud software and the regulatory burden becomes more expensive and time-consuming, financial institutions are looking to improve their processes to be more efficient and please customers.\n\nSimple processes can drag on for weeks in financial institutions. Cloud software, nCino, and nCino\u2019s competitors are helping solve this problem. nCino aims to change these manual processes and make financial institutions more nimble while still being compliant with all regulations.\n\nAccording to Gartner, banking had the highest global enterprise IT spending of all industries with approximately $376 billion spent in 2018. Although nCino only defines its serviceable addressable market at $10bn, the broader IT industry gives nCino a long runway of future potential growth.\n\nnCino has a number of competitors. My initial research shows that nCino competes with Fiserv, Oracle, and other small companies. In order to invest in nCino, a deeper look into the competitive environment will need to be completed.\n\n**Business Overview**\n\nnCino was founded in 2012 by a team of bankers. These founders built a software company solving problems for banks. The founders knew the struggles that often occur inside banks and used their knowledge to solve these problems. nCino is a bank operating system platform. It helps provide banks onboard, originate loans, open accounts, and many other processes. The CEO stated in an interview that \u201che wants the software to do everything from operations, ranging from treasury management to mortgages (coming soon), to tracking employees\u2019 efficiency.\u201d nCino already has relationships with over 305 financial institutions that use the nCino bank operating system, which is their main platform, and then nCino has another 920 financial institutions that use the portfolio analytics solution tool that was acquired in the acquisition of Visible Equity.\n\nnCino has already signed some of the largest financial institutions in the world. nCino boasts Bank of America, Barclays, TD Bank, and many regional community banks, credit unions, and challenger banks as customers.\n\nnCino sells its software on a per-seat basis. This gives it room to continue to expand within its existing customer base. nCino also stands to benefit from capturing more financial institutional clients and expanding their average contract value.\n\nHere is a list of nCino\u2019s offerings: loan origination, portfolio analytics, compliance and risk management, digital customer engagement, customer relationship management (CRM), client onboarding, deposit account opening, business process automation, and enterprise content management.\n\n**Total Addressable Market**\n\nnCino\u2019s S-1 touts that there are more than 28,000 financial institutions worldwide. Gartner also lists banking as the industry with the highest global enterprise IT spending with approximately $376 billion spent in 2018. The financial industry is one of the largest industries and if nCino can help power even a sliver of this industry, it will be a good future for this company. Of course, I have to caveat this by saying that starting a t-shirt business and capturing 1% of the apparel industry may seem plausible, but it is impossible. I make this statement because nCino already has a strong base of customers and has done the work to capture this pie. This gives it the possibility to capture more market share, not all of it, but more.\n\nThe bull thesis for nCino is to be the main software operating system for banks. As banks become more reliant on technology, nCino will prove to be a critical piece of infrastructure. nCino will also develop more product offerings that help their customers. This enhances the stickiness of nCino and leads to upsell opportunities.\n\nnCino\u2019s management team lists the total serviceable market for nCino\u2019s bank operating system at more than $10bn. I believe this is within reason and management is likely underestimating (on purpose or not) the addressable market they believe they can capture.\n\n**Competitive Advantages**\n\nAlthough I like to be optimistic about companies when researching them, I do think nCino is quite an attractive company based on my research on the qualitative aspects of the business.\n\n* **Mission-critical product with high switching costs.**\n   * The solutions that nCino provides are for mission-critical processes that banks want to be done right. Financial institutions would rather have a manual time-consuming process than an automatic process that goes wrong. Switching costs come into play once customers are comfortable with nCino\u2019s product. As customers rely more and more on nCino, these customers are unlikely to switch. Switching from nCino (or any company) to a competitor may lead to outages, issues, and lots of problems that financial institutions will not risk having to deal with. Even if financial institutions attempt to build out their own bank operating system, it will be costly, prone to error, and not worth it! That\u2019s like trying to build out Stripe if you\u2019re an e-commerce company (@Shopify). Allocating capital to build out this function will make zero sense for financial institutions. It\u2019s better to stick to what you know and what you\u2019re good at. That\u2019s why nCino will have high switching costs.\n* **Economies of scale.**\n   * The cost of building out a suite of software products and deploying it to a large customer base is much cheaper for a large company than a small company. Just like no startup would try and compete directly with Amazon, Shopify, Salesforce, Stripe, etc, as nCino grows, no company will come close to competing in the same fashion due to their scale benefits. As nCino looks to expand its product offering, the attractiveness of nCino\u2019s products to financial institutions will only grow. Financial institutions, a very risk-averse set of customers, want products that have been vetted by other financial institutions, and have offerings that solve critical problems.\n\n**Financials**\n\nLike many SaaS companies, nCino has two primary revenue lines. The first is recurring revenue similar to most SaaS companies. The second revenue source is professional services revenue.
