        "selftext": "**Honeywell and the Quantum Computing Revolution**\n\nHoneywell is a huge industrial conglomerate that has been a legacy manufacturing company for several decades now. Many of you know what the company is, but you probably also know them vaguely compared to some of their other industrial competitors such as General Electric. Honeywell is a huge defense contractor and a manufacturer of productivity and building solutions such as thermostats, security systems, and air purifiers. Honeywell\u2019s aerospace division manufactures engines and provides integrated avionics solutions along with them. Honeywell also manufactures automobile parts such as turbochargers and electricity solutions. On top of that, they provide the software necessary for a lot of their own tools and technologies to function. You could say that Honeywell is a large legacy company that has a solid line of products, it functions in an industry where there\u2019s not much new competition grabbing at your throat, and that in and of itself makes it a buy. However, while Honeywell may have fit into the average portfolio that needs manufacturing just fine, it\u2019s not exactly an amazing value. It has several large competitors domestically and internationally and they don\u2019t do seemingly anything outside of the ordinary that GE (which is a better value) does, or that Siemens (an international competitor) does. As far as the average investor can tell, there\u2019s no growth prospect for him and as far as the experienced one can tell, there\u2019s no opportunity within the company either. However, as I was going through the news (as an investor should) I discovered that [Honeywell is developing their own quantum computer](https://www.honeywell.com/en-us/newsroom/news/2020/06/the-worlds-highest-performing-quantum-computer-is-here), which should position it very nicely for an investor looking for safe and sustainable growth as Honeywell has some very solid financials and the potential in the quantum computing segment is huge. Due to COVID-19, their past quarterly results were significantly down as their aerospace revenues depend significantly on global air traffic, but their share prices haven\u2019t suffered much and that I believe has primarily to do with the 2 things I\u2019ll discuss in here; an exceptionally strong balance sheet and a high-growth potential industry. \n\nLet\u2019s start off looking at Honeywell\u2019s finances:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zuypj8ra7iz51.png?width=777&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e10faea11f73330047e1f50ac8b7ffc127d6263a\n\nFor the past few years, cash has grown at a far higher rate when in proportion to total debt\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m5nfspqk7iz51.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f9d96122a35a9924347dec2e8f7ee20a5d44c21\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bfuplukl7iz51.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8089771fef7fcf2999afa96c0e7446813990e66e\n\nHere\u2019s a peak into Honeywell\u2019s Income statement, whose growth has been pretty constant until (seemingly) last year. But the reason revenue and Net Income shrank was due to two spin-offs that provided over $10B for them. When factoring for revenue lost due to the sold assets/liabilities, Honeywell\u2019s revenue actually grew by 4% from 2018-2019\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/26e8ppsm7iz51.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07d943e978251e21325c6159b15a73b4dfab42a0\n\n  \nDue to the sales of unprofitable assets, Honeywell\u2019s gross profit margins have increased significantly in the past 2 years\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eektjqhn7iz51.png?width=394&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d51b0eeaac3cead22bae66dca982a51398ad2ba5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y7te6lzr7iz51.png?width=726&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=501971c6bccb7c57ef174800aba66e23837e73fb\n\nThis explains the EBITDA growth over the past few years as well\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jr6kcmzs7iz51.png?width=613&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a32e33fa4eca4333101edf9dbf4487c39cc692e\n\nHere\u2019s how Honeywell\u2019s divisions split up currently, with aerospace making up most of their sales, and that division has increased sales by 9% from 2018-2019 when adjusting for spin-offs .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2zgq49vt7iz51.png?width=383&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7490c69dd659d32e04e414faaa5aab82f58626a\n\nHere\u2019s Honeywell\u2019s  cash per share, which has grown very quickly since 2015\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vwcxuoiu7iz51.png?width=377&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b3ec82ffa1c17600a0c9aaa3422a22c841badf0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere\u2019s their free cash flow, which has also been accumulating several years\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8n14lay08iz51.png?width=360&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=550cf128a1a7360df6c8a4da4dbe8703f7de1de6\n\nThis is Honeywell\u2019s EBITDA growth over the last 20+ years\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3l5vmzo18iz51.png?width=385&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7bb50c6302bf1e0b7ebf7b3287d44c329db019a0\n\nAnd here\u2019s their SGA Expenses per $ of gross profit\n\nTheir profit consistency compared to General Electric or Boeing, two similar industrials companies is remarkable: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z4jqsbl28iz51.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6cc6b16cd0110c258c8f8e9027998b1f33c05219\n\nHoneywell clearly knows how to manage their financials despite being a complicated conglomerate, which is why their stock price has recovered so well compared to BA and GE. This shows that regardless of how overvalued it may be, that\u2019ll be justified by the means of their consistently growing profits. Investors seek conservative companies such as Honeywell, especially during times of financial volatility, which is why the stock price has fared so much better during these past couple of months compared to their competitors.\n\n**The Future:**\n\nThis year despite all of the troubles with COVID-19, Honeywell was able to deliver on their promise of making the world\u2019s highest-performing quantum computer this year. You\u2019ve probably heard the term, but haven\u2019t really bothered to try and understand it. Here, I\u2019ll draw out a very basic dichotomy between a normal computer and a quantum computer.\n\nTraditional computers perform their problem solving through processing information in \u201cbits\u201d which are binary (0s and 1s). These bits are processed through transistors as electrons, but as transistors get smaller and smaller, they reach a point at which the laws of quantum mechanics prevent any further shrinkage. Quantum computers would process information as qubits, and these blocks of information can contain any proportion of 0s and 1s inside of them (superposition), and this greatly increases their information storage capabilities we\u2019d have for problem solving. Another important property of qubits is their ability to become entangled; to have two particles change in accordance with each other, unlocking powerful parallel processing opportunities.\n\nQuantum computing will be an essential technology for Artificial Intelligence, because AI is very simulation and probability based, the nature of quantum computers processing power would be ideal in order to accelerate the parallel processing needed to train and use ML models. In order to solve for the amount of simulations you need for AI-based solutions, the qubit would be the perfect means to solve them. AI solutions can range from cryptography, financial modeling, weather forecasting, and even particle physics.\n\n\u201c[For example](https://www.honeywell.com/en-us/newsroom/news/2019/11/the-future-of-quantum-computing), pharmaceutical companies could accelerate the discovery of new drugs, materials companies could discover new molecular structures, finance companies could develop new trading strategies, transportation companies could optimize logistics, and companies relying on the output of machine and deep learning could perform analyses that are impossible with classical computing of today\u201d\n\nHoneywell is partnering with Microsoft Azure Quantum to enable their computer and they already have a client using it in JP Morgan. Honeywell Ventures has also invested in two large quantum computing companies, Zapata and Cambridge Quantum. Add to that Honeywell\u2019s quantum supremacy: \u201cWith a quantum volume of 64, the Honeywell quantum computer is twice as powerful as the next alternative in the industry\u201d\n\nDue to the particularly industrial nature of quantum computers themselves, Honeywell is actually not a surprising entrant into this space. They already have an extensive software segment, and aren\u2019t a slouch there by any means either. Honeywell\u2019s system has [double](https://searchdatacenter.techtarget.com/news/252491505/Honeywells-quantum-computer-makes-a-quantum-volume-leap) the quantum volume of IBM\u2019s quantum computer. Honeywell also \u201c[unveiled](https://searchdatacenter.techtarget.com/news/252491505/Honeywells-quantum-computer-makes-a-quantum-volume-leap) a two-tier subscription plan designed to make it easier and less expensive for users to upgrade quantum systems\u201d. If Honeywell can successfully create a subscription model for easier quantum accessibility, it would be the next biggest enterprise solution software, magnitudes greater than something simple like CRM. It\u2019s obviously a very complicated and foggy outlook still as to the mysteries of quantum computing, but we know the potential would be tremendous and it could create another leap in the types of problems we can solve as a civilization. \n\nNot only is a Honeywell a decent value stock by itself, it also has tons of potential with this new segment which investors are clearly pricing in. There are pretty much no events or anything that can cause some awesome volatility for us to bank off, but I think in the next 2-5 year span we'll see a good amount of growth if this works out, so hold stock, but be on the lookout for any announcements that you could possibly play (again no short term play here, sorry)\n\nPositions: stonk",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 30th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks on track to close out month of big gains as jobs data looms  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/27/stocks-on-track-to-close-out-month-of-big-gains-next-week-as-jobs-data-looms.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks next week will come off one of their best months ever into a busy week of economic data and the ongoing tensions between the spreading virus and positive news on vaccines and treatments.\n*****\n&gt; Another highlight of the week is expected to be Tuesday\u2019s testimony from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin before the Senate Banking Committee. They will be discussing the emergency measures taken to help the economy after the outbreak of the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow was up nearly 13% for November so far, and if it holds its gains into Monday\u2019s close, it will chalk up its best month since January, 1987. The S&amp;P 500 closed at a record 3,638 and was up 11.3% for the month. The gain is its best performance since April\u2019s 12.7%, which was the third best month for the S&amp;P 500 since its origin in 1957.\n*****\n&gt; November was a big month also for market rotation, with investors favoring stocks that would benefit from a rebounding economy and showing less love for long-held favorites among big tech and internet names. Financials were up more than 17% in the past month, and industrials rose nearly 15%, as investors bet vaccines would help the economy return to normal next year.\n*****\n&gt; Tech notched a single digit gain for the month so far and lagged the broader market. But some strategists expect big tech and internet names, stay-at-home stocks, to fare better in December.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe death of big tech has been announced over and over again, and we see that the market doesn\u2019t abandon them, but in fact migrates to big tech whenever there are concerns,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \u201cThe post-pandemic question is whether big tech can co-exist with the small and mid-cap.\u201d Small caps were one of the biggest winners in November, with the Russell 2000, up 20.6%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe did not see major selling in Nasdaq,\u201d as investors put funds in cyclicals and value, she said. Nasdaq was up 11.9% for the month so far, slightly better than the S&amp;P 500.\n*****\n&gt; Experts have warned that there could an even bigger surge in virus cases, following the Thanksgiving holiday which could start to show up in the coming week. There have been more than 12.6 million cases in the U.S.\n*****\n&gt; # Jobs report\n&gt; There are some important economic reports in the week ahead, the most important being Friday\u2019s November employment report. There is is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMy thought here is the data is going to matter because if you listen to the Fed, and if you read through the Fed\u2019s minutes, they\u2019re in transition here. They\u2019re becoming more concerned about the rise in Covid cases, certainly about the lack of fiscal support,\u201d said Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists say another key report will be weekly jobless claims, which showed an increase in each of the last two weeks. \u201cThe employment data clearly has been weakening,\u201d said Faranello. If it continues, it will keep a lid on Treasury yields, which move opposite prices.\n*****\n&gt; Jefferies economist Tom Simons expects the elimination of Census Bureau workers to detract from the job gains in November, and he forecasts the economy added just 340,000 jobs.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt is hard to envision a particularly strong report coming out on Friday,\u201d noted Simons.\n*****\n&gt; Bank of America economists forecast just 150,000 payrolls were added for November, compared to 638,000 in October. The private sector is expected to add 300,000, but expected government layoffs impacted total payrolls in their forecast.\n*****\n&gt; Faranello said he expects the bond market to be much more active than normal this December because of the pending change in the White House, as well as the runoff election in Georgia Jan. 5 that will decide whether Republicans keep their Senate majority. The market has also been concerned about the lack of stimulus from Washington.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe theme in the market right now is definitely hope and optimism versus the on the ground dynamic with Covid,\u201d said Faranello. \u201cThe real question is can the vaccine rally hold up if we see the virus rise and we continue to see shutdowns. How does the market perform in light of that?\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said she expects the market to watch for vaccine news. \u201cThe question I think is now whether or not we see the emergency authorization given to Pfizer and followed by Moderna,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that is a catalyst to the market because that is when you will start to see the vaccine distributed.\u201d The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s vaccine advisory committee has a meeting set for Dec. 10 to discuss emergency authorization for the Pfizer\n*****\n&gt; Analysts expect investors to continue to gravitate to value and cyclicals, since they could have the biggest gains compared to already high priced big tech. But tech is still attractive.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe still see the Nasdaq leading,\u201d said Krosby. \u201cWhereas we enjoyed the vaccine related boom in the market, the fact is that investors and and traders are looking for big tech names to give them that growth in earnings and revenues.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ZTiIHZf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/kSw4HNb.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/oXE2aJo.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/30Iefrr.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/TEArZTK.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BzpCasV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2DhrB6V.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cRtEdkM.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ShSvr9G.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/e5ILGPd.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/e5ILGPd.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # December Almanac: Small Caps Have Shined\n\n&gt; December is now the number three S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials month since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% on each index. It\u2019s the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and third best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000 (1979). In 2018, DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of 2018 is not highly likely. When December is down it is usually a turning point in the market\u2014near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half of the month.\n\n&gt; In the last seventeen election years, December\u2019s ranking changed modestly to #2 DJIA, #5 NASDAQ, but S&amp;P 500 remains #3. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, have had a field day in election-year Decembers. Since 1980, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just once in ten election years in December. The average small cap gain in all ten years is a solid 3.0%. The Russell 2000\u2019s single loss was in 1980 when the Prime Rate was 21.5%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a451723116af31d8c7273c588c33b6c8/950092ad30c7af73-09/s400x600/360e0edef191c0c34d744f4a5ecd32fd8845da9d.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sector Weights Rising and Falling\n\n&gt; For most of the past year, one significant trend on a sector by sector basis has been the outperformance of sectors like Technology and Consumer Discretionary. The relative strength lines of these sectors have consistently shown outperformance versus the rest of the S&amp;P 500 as a whole, but since August, other sectors have begun to take the wheel. As we noted in today's Sector Snapshot, just about every sector has had a banner month in November with some of the biggest month to date rallies of the past 30 years, but some sectors have seen much larger returns than others. One of the best examples of this has been Energy which has risen over 35% in November. Similarly, Financials has risen an astounding 19.5% this month compared to more modest but still significant rallies of around 10% from Tech and Consumer Discretionary. Given those large degrees of outperformance, the relative strength lines of Energy and Financials have taken a sharp turn higher in recent weeks. Similarly, they have seen a turnaround in their weightings in the S&amp;P 500 as shown in the charts below.\n\n&gt; Over the past three months, the Financial sector has gained a full percentage point weighting while the Technology sector has lost 1.36 percentage points with a decline in weighting in three straight months. For Financials, that is the largest gain in weighting in a three month span since January 2017. For Tech, outside of the reshuffling in 2018 that saw a large share of its weight change into Communication Services, the last time the sector lost this much or more in weighting in three months was November of 2008. Prior to this recent string of losing weight over the past three months, Tech had seen weight gain in every month from October of last year through August. Even though the weight loss has been significant, it has only put a dent in the increased share of the entirety of the past year as the sector's weight is only back down to where it was in May.\n\n&gt; Similarly, looking at the other sectors, while Financials have added a full percentage point in share over the past few months, that follows nine months of declines running from last December through August. That brings the sector's weighting back above 10% in the S&amp;P 500, but that is only at the highest level since March. Similarly, Materials and Industrials have also seen their weights rise for three and four months in a row, respectively. As for Energy, the 0.44 percentage point gain in November is set to snap six straight months of declines; the longest such streak since at least 1990. As with Financials, that turn around this month has only put a dent in the longer term trend of weight loss as Energy's weighting is now only back to its highest level since July. Opposite of Energy, Consumer Discretionary is on pace to lose weight for the first time since March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/112720-Sector-Weights.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # A Month to Be Thankful For\n\n&gt; Heading into today with just three trading days left in November, the average Russell 1,000 stock was up 17.44% month to date. As shown below, not one of the five largest stocks is up even close to 17% on the month. For a market that had recently been driven higher in large part because of the five mega-cap Tech names, November has seen the mega-caps stall a bit while the rest of the market has seen broad participation. This is the type of breadth that market bulls have been waiting and hoping for.\n\n&gt; Of the 35 largest stocks in the Russell 1,000, Tesla (TSLA) is up the most so far this month with a gain of 43%. The other big winners include Chevron (CVX), JP Morgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Disney (DIS), and Comcast (CMCSA). Not one stock in the top 35 is down on the month, but the ones that are up the least are Netflix (NFLX), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Amazon (AMZN), and Home Depot (HD).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/largeststocks.png))**\n\n&gt; Looking at sectors, the average Energy stock in the Russell 1,000 is up 46% month-to-date but still down 27% year-to-date. Three other sectors have seen their stocks average MTD gains of more than 20%: Financials, Industrials, and Real Estate. Stocks in the Health Care and Utilities sectors are up the least on an average basis this month, but even these underperformers are still up more than 5%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/avgpctchg.png))**\n\n&gt; There are 37 stocks in the Russell 1,000 up more than 50% so far in November. Below is a list of this month's biggest winners. Coty (COTY) and Nordstrom (JWN) stand out the most with gains of more than 100%, followed by Spirit AeroSystems (SPR), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Diamondback Energy (FANG), and Empire State Realty (ESRT). The list of biggest winners this month is full of names that got hit hardest by COVID in areas like energy, travel, retail, and real estate. Notably, while these stocks are up an average of 68.5% in November, they're still down an average of 23% on the year. On a median basis, they're down even more year-to-date at -31.55%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/best-mtd.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Biden - Best Since Reagan\n\n&gt; The market started off November on a positive note, and even after the election has continued to add to its gains. Through the close today (11/24), the S&amp;P 500 is up 7.90% since the close on Election Day. Relative to every other Presidential election since the beginning of the S&amp;P back in 1928, the three-week performance of the S&amp;P 500 following this Election Day ranks as the second-best of all time. It came down right to the wire, but the only other US President to see a stronger market reaction to their election (or re-election) was Ronald Reagan in 1980 (7.97%). Behind Reagan and Biden, the only other Presidents where the S&amp;P 500 experienced an upside move of 5%+ in reaction to their elections were Hoover in 1928 and Clinton in 1996.\n\n&gt; On the downside, the most negative reaction of the market in the three weeks after Election Day was the 14.75% decline following President Obama's election in 2008. In addition to Obama, the S&amp;P 500's four other three-week downside moves of more than 5% came after the elections of Truman in 1948, the election of George W Bush in 2000 (although at the time it was unknown who was the winner of that election), the election of Franklin D Roosevelt in 1932, and Dwight D Eisenhower's re-election in 1956.\n\n&gt; In aggregate, the S&amp;P 500 hasn't historically responded all that great in the three weeks after a Presidential election. For every one since 1928, the median return of the S&amp;P 500 in the three weeks after Election Day has been a gain of just 0.35%. Breaking out returns by party, in the three weeks after a Democratic candidate is elected, the S&amp;P 500's median performance is a decline of 1.11% compared to a median gain of 3.04% when a Republican is elected.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/112420-President.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # DJIA 1,000 Point Thresholds\n\n&gt; What a wild year 2020 has been! With the DJIA closing above 30,000 today, it was the second first-time upside break of a 1,000 point threshold this year. While there have only been two new upside crosses of 1,000 point thresholds, due to the sharp pullback in March from the pandemic that briefly took the DJIA below 19,000 on a closing basis, there have actually been 12 different upside 1,000 point thresholds at some point in the year.\n\n&gt; The table below lists the first time that the DJIA closed above each 1,000 point threshold in its history along with the total number of times the index has crossed that level on a closing basis throughout history. The thousand point level that has seen the most crosses on a closing basis was 11,000 (87 crosses) while 10,000 ranks second at 67.\n\n&gt; Obviously, the higher the DJIA goes, the less impactful a move of 1,000 points becomes. At current levels, 1,000 points represents just 3.3%, which is really nothing more than a very bad day in the market. Given the diminishing impact of 1,000 points in the DJIA these days, their significance declines. Even still, the twelve new 1,000-point crosses since the 2016 election has given the President (who has publicly discussed the stock market more than any other President in history) plenty of ammunition to tweet about.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/112420-1000-Points-Threshold.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 30,000 Reasons To Be Thankful\n\n&gt; As 2020 winds down, it has been an extremely tough year on all of us. Still, there are many reasons to be thankful and today we will share some reasons investors should be thankful.\n\n&gt; Stocks have had one of the largest reversals ever in 2020, something to be thankful for. In fact, this could be the first year ever to see the S&amp;P 500 down more than 30% peak-to-trough and finish higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.25.20-Revised-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We should also be thankful that Congress was split in 2020, likely marking the 11th consecutive year the S&amp;P 500 gained under a split Congress. Gridlock is good they tell us and that very well could be true yet again.\n\n&gt; Want something else to be thankful for? We likely will have a split Congress for another two years after the two Georgia runoffs are official.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-2-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Let\u2019s be thankful that it is looking like stocks once again will be higher the year a President is up for re-election. In fact, you have to go back to FDR in the \u201840s the last time the S&amp;P 500 was lower for the year when a President was up for re-election.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-3-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Let\u2019s be thankful that the fastest bear market in history (only 16 days) is officially a thing of the past.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-4-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We are thankful that we are in a new bull market, which if history plays out once again, could have a lot of life left to it. In fact, the average bull market has lasted more than five years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-5-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cLet\u2019s be thankful that the huge move off the March lows was a major clue of more strength,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWe noted at the time (many different ways) that the enormous move we saw off the March lows likely suggested significantly higher prices, while many ignored the market signals and instead looked for a re-test for months on end.\u201d\n\n&gt; The 20-days off the March lows was the second best 20-day rally ever and sure enough, the returns have been very strong.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-6-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We are finally seeing many stocks participate in this bull market, another reason to be thankful. In fact, the Value Line Arithmetic Index recently made new all-time highs. This index is a great look at what the \u2018average\u2019 stock is doing and is a sign that this move isn\u2019t being led by just a few large cap tech stocks.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-7-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Let\u2019s be thankful that the NYSE Cumulative Advance/Decline line is at new highs. This looks at how many stocks are going up versus down and new highs are a sign of very healthy participation.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-8-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Emerging markets have started to turn higher and we are thankful that this group could be on the verge of a major breakout to new highs, clearing their peak from 2007. As we move into \u201921, this is one group we think could continue to do quite well for investors.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-9-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Global investors should be thankful, as the MSCI Global Index broke out to new highs as well, suggesting this rally isn\u2019t only about the US anymore.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-10-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We upgraded our view on small caps in September and the Russell 2000 Index is currently on pace to have its best monthly return ever. Investors should be thankful that this group is finally participating, as there are many more small caps than large caps, another sign of improving breadth, while small caps are also more domestic by nature and could be suggesting a strong US economy next year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-11-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Investors should be thankful for the incredible strength around the election, as the S&amp;P 500 gained more than 1% four consecutive days.

        "selftext": "* **Q: I don\u2019t want to read. Can you summarize all the shit you wrote below in one sentence?**\n\nMonday will be the last day of $ZI\u2019s lockup period, meaning that from next Tuesday on, 320 million of the locked shares will be allowed to be sold to the public.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Q: What is $ZI?**\n\n**$ZI (Zoominfo) has nothing to do with $ZM (Zoom)**. **It has nothing to do with video conferencing or WFH**. Zoominfo provides client relationship management solutions. For example, it helps salespeople to find new leads and helps marketing people to better target customers. Its business is similar to Salesforce, albeit much smaller and with a narrower focus.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Q: How many shares are currently outstanding?**\n\n69 million\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Q: How many more shares will be unlocked?**\n\n**320 million,** or **4.6 times current outstanding shares**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Q: How many shares on average are traded each day?**\n\n30 day average volume is about 1.7 million. So **the unlocked shares are 188 times average trading volume**. Or in other words, **even if only 0.5% of these unlocked shares are sold, that is already more than entire day\u2019s trading volume.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Q: Do you have any proof?**\n\n[https://sec.report/Document/0001628280-20-009087/](https://sec.report/Document/0001628280-20-009087/) Read yourself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Q: What if nobody sells these unlocked shares because they think the share price is still low?**\n\n$ZI\u2019s IPO price is 21$, it is right now trading 51.5$, **or 245% of its IPO price**. Plus, **its IPO was priced above the range**. Almost every tech IPO was priced above the range this year due to the tech fever.\n\nIt has outperformed competitor $HUBS by 9% this week alone, for... no reason at all. So I don't think share price is low at this point. **It is even up 9% today because people have no idea lockup will expire next week.** Thanks for the perfect short opportunity though.\n\nLet\u2019s say you are an early investor or employee of $ZI. You made your investment or received stock option pre-ipo. The share price you paid pre-ipo must be significantly lower than IPO price 21$. Now, the share has gained 145% from even the IPO price, meaning **it probably gained 300%, 400% from the price you paid. Would you choose to at least take some profits?**\n\nRemember, **even if only 0.5% of these people choose to take profit, the selling pressure will already be higher than a whole day\u2019s trading volume**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Q: What if nobody sells these unlocked shares because they think the fundamentals are undervalued?**\n\nPrice to sales ratio is 32.5, which is 3 times Salesforce\u2019s P/S 10 and twice Hubspot\u2019s P/S 17. I won\u2019t say it is undervalued.\n\nMore importantly, hey, wake up, this year is 2020. Nobody gives a fuck about valuation. When people buy, price goes up. **When people sell, price goes down.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Q: How much can a stock fall when a big selling pressure is expected?**\n\nI will give you an opposite example. How much can a stock rise when a big buying pressure is expected?\n\n$TSLA, every autist knows.\n\nS&amp;P 500 inclusion will create a $51 billion dollar, or roughly let\u2019s say 100 million shares $TSLA buying pressure. $TSLA trades more this week, but its average daily volume is about 40 million shares. So the buying pressure expected is about 2.5x daily volume. This inclusion will happen on Dec. 18, so still more than 2 weeks away. Even tho it\u2019s still 2 weeks away, $TSLA has already risen 45% since the S&amp;P news.\n\nNow you can build your own expectation on how much $ZI can fall.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Q: If I want to sell the shares now, is it already too late?** \n\nIt has been up 40% this month. No retracement has happened yet. **Few people are even aware that this company exists, let alone its lockup is ending Monday.** So here I am writing to tell you that. If people knew about this, it would have shitted its bed already.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Q: But 2 weeks ago, Morgan Stanley upgraded their price target?** \n\nNothing unexpected here. Morgan Stanley is the lead underwriter of $ZI. I am yet to see any lead underwriter downgrades stocks it underwrote before lockup expires. **These bankers**, who are going to make tens of millions of dollars this year even when the poor are losing jobs, **know how to kiss their customers\u2019 assholes.**\n\nThe stock has risen 25% after the upgrade. Even without a lockup expiry, a correction may still be expected. It\u2019s no $TSLA, **it does not have a meme status. A regular stock is unlikely to go one way up without hiccups.**\n\nOther banks' targets are even lower than its current trading price. And banks' target are meant to be for 12 months later, even without considering the lockup release.\n\nIf you trust Morgan Stanley\u2019s price target simply because you trust the bank\u2019s name, it would be logical to go YOLO on $MS and hold it forever. Why don\u2019t you do that?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Q: So TLDR, should I sell the shares?**\n\nYou are not 5 years old. Make your own damn decision. If you think the unlocking of 320 million shares will create a selling pressure, sell it. If you think every single stock in the world should be worth 420.69$ as our living Jesus Elon has hinted, then buy it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***You are welcome.***",

        "selftext": "supp guys, hope you are ready for another busy week of loss porn and short selling reports that gonna destroy your accounts. \n\nFor all those of you who missed the pltr and gme train or are too scared to get in (if you are than gtfo of this subreddit), I'm going to show you a company that is so undervalued it hurts and its to take off soon\ud83d\ude80\n\n**So what is Alteryx?**\n\nglad you asked, Alteryx is a data analytics data science company that provides a platform for companies to perform analysis of the data, share it, and deploy lots of analytic models. The platform can be used by business analysts, programmers, and trained data scientists. The company wants to solve the problem of wasting time in the organization for doing simple Data analytics. As for 2020 60 BILLION DOLLARS per year wasted on analysts doing repetitive manual work in spreadsheets. The uniqueness of this company is that the interface of the platform is very intuitive and user friendly, using drag and drop interface and mainly reduces the need to write complex software code. Their platform is designed to interact with almost any data source, starting from IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP to AWS, Google Analytics, Workday, and more.\n\n**Who are the customers?**\n\nSo the company has, as of 2020, approx. 7000 customers in more than 90 countries and big names like Netflix, Salesforce, Toyota, Chevron, Uber, Twitter, Xerox, Nasdaq, and many more. The company already has a name in the big boys' playground and we can expect it to continue to expand. \n\n**Tell me more, please.**\n\nNo problem amigo. The company continues its growth strategy by a series of acquisitions mainly for developing tools and talented people. in 2019 they acquired ClearStory Data mainly because the developers are very good and can leverage them to help to develop and improve their tools. They acquired Feature Labs to augment their machine learning capabilities and to penetrate to the East coast of the US. Also the company announced strategic alliances with Adobe, UiPath and ABBYY to accelerate adoption of APA (analytic process automation) which altreyx is a leader at. \n\nAlteryx is a subscription-based software which makes it a SaaS company the same as TTD, Shopify and so on, but it focuses on analytics. Their main competitors are the big software companies (IBM, Microsoft, SAP) and some small ones which most of them are private.                  So in order to compare them to check if they are under/overvalued, I will use companies in the same field as Datadog, Splunk, and more.\n\n**Let's dig in for some numbers**\n\nAnnual revenue has increased from 86M to 418M in just 4 years (2016-2019) that is a 48% CAGR which is amazing. This year the company expects to grow revenues at around 15% mainly because of covid, which made companies cut expenses.\n\nQ3 revenues growth is 38% YOY, customer growth is 24% YOY.                                                        Gross Margin is 93% (Amazing) Operating Margin is 24%. This company is super efficient and with great margins.\n\nThe company is profitable as of the 3Q with a positive EPS of 0.07. It uses more than 50% of its gross profit for R&amp;D which is exactly what we want to see in a growing tech company.\n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\nCash is down to 95M from 409M mainly because of acquisitions, but short term investments are almost double YOY with 627M. **Current Ration** is 1:4 approx. and **asset to liabilities ratio** is 1:1.5 so the company is indeed solvent and can survive even black swans like covid.                 Liabilities wise the company has 650M in convertible bonds which as we see can be covered by the short-term investments, It is something we should consider when the company starts to underperform, not now though. \n\nCash from Operating Activities for the 3Q is 16.3 M an improvement of 20%                              FCF is negative for the quarter mainly because of the investments they made (240M) \n\nSo the company is performing really well so far this year and is able to grow despite covid and companies reducing expenses. Of course, they need to increase their FCF but as long as they are growing and acquiring companies it's all good.\n\n**Let's use some gay TA to see what's going on**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[AYX 1 day chart](https://preview.redd.it/eu91ywiifd261.jpg?width=1374&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96335b788ca104400101c7f29fdc13435ce4aac7)\n\nWell as you see AYX is in a range for quite a while (since May) with 104 and 80 acting as support and 150 and 178 as resistance. It hits 104 twice and couldn't break it and in the last 2 weeks, it tried again, and again was denied. \n\nSo the stock can now go to 150 easily or contest again the 104 level. with the tech trend going up I can see it going to retest that 150 level hoping to break it.\n\n**Now we compare this company with other companies**\n\n \n\n* SNOW: \u201821 EV / Rev = \\~100x\n* DDOG: \u201821 EV / Rev = \\~ 40x\n* MongoDB: \u201821 EV / Rev = \\~ 25x\n* **Alteryx: \u201821 EV / Rev = \\~ 15x**\n* JFROG: \u201821 EV / Rev = \\~ 30x \n* PLTR \u201821 EV / Rev = \\~ 50x\n\n(thanks  [u/xwpv8j62](https://new.reddit.com/user/xwpv8j62/) for the info)\n\nAs you see AYX is the most UNDERVALUED company here which means a lot of room to grow.\n\nGross Margin:\n\n**AYX- 92%**\n\nDDOG- 78%\n\nSNOW - 55%\n\nMongoDB- 69%\n\nP/S Ratio:\n\n**AYX-  16.95**\n\nDDOG- 51.71\n\nSNOW - 150.15\n\nMONGODB-  30.88\n\nPLTR - 47.76\n\nAYX has the best margin, best ratios, and still is way undervalued than its peers. This is wrong and YOU have a chance to take advantage of it.\n\n**TL:DR,**  Shares and January Calls at 120/130 strike will do the work.\n\nHave fun guys happy trading and tendies for y'all.",

        "selftext": "My post [last Sunday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jmbuff/i_draw_with_crayons_so_you_dont_have_to_this/) where I talk about my positions. [On Wednesday I did a follow up](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jo3up7/4k_in_realized_gains_from_sunday_positions_next/) and discussed why I held some, closed others, and also why I opened up cash-secured-puts on QCOM right before earnings for a $450 pay-day.\n\nKeep in mind I only sell puts and buy shares. I made $4k on putting roughly $80k of collateral down for buying shares if I end up getting assigned. My true profit was about 5% last week with relatively low-risk positions where if they went against me I would bag-hold until profitable. When you are willing to bag-hold for months you literally cannot lose on any position (not financial advice). If you're ready to take your trading to the next level and do some technical ANAL(ysis) with me, then follow along. For those of you that hate money close this thread immediately.\n\nLastly, before I start. This is my game-plan for tomorrow's open. A lot depends on the price action in the morning. If market is down big or flat in the morning it will help me sell puts or buy shares, if we open hulk green then I just may need to wait. I haven't entered any of these positions yet. Normally I don't do this many positions, but it's earnings so its time to YOLO on some theta decay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore we start, when you look at my charts:\n\n**PINK = CHANNEL LINES** where the stock bounces between that range. When a stock exits a channel it either:\n\n1. Comes right back down into the channel or\n\n2. Begins to form a new channel.\n\nYou will never know which option happened until after-the-fact.\n\n**BLUE = SUPPORT OR RESISTANCE LINES**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll positions listed should be expected to expire this Friday the 13th of November. You can always go out further to collect more premium. It all depends on your strategy and what you are comfortable with.\n\n**DDOG - Earnings on Tuesday**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9quq9wx0i3y51.png?width=1964&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91186ec0288bd562ee7a4fc31f96f4de3591efc7\n\nDDOG provides cloud-based services. They shit the bed last earnings and the stock tanked 20% the next day. Am I worried about that happening again? Of course. Do I think it will? No. They are currently trading 10% higher than they were from market-close of their last earnings call. For any of you that have been following the stock, they landed a huge deal with Microsoft and we are about to find out just how much value that contract will bring. For that reason I think it will put a hard floor on where the stock might drop to.\n\n**Positions:** \n\n$95p strike for $4.25 premium expiring this week will net you a return of about 4.5%. \n\nBreak-even only reached if stock drops to $90.75.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**RKT - Earnings on Tuesday**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1r6vebe2i3y51.png?width=1968&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a41d32126ce49e2e91ec8b05af193af5bfd916a\n\nRKT is somewhat of a recent IPO so the stock price is all over the place. What I do see on the chart is some strong support at the $18 and $20 level. The trend is currently down, but it looks like the stock might be reversing and breaking into a new channel through earnings this week. Good earnings will rocket this stock back to $25+, poor earnings we can re-test the $20 level. I like the upside on this one relative to what the downside might be. I'll be selling puts here.\n\n**Positions:** \n\n$20p strike for $0.75 premium will have a return of 3.75%\n\nBreak-even is reached if the stock drops below $19.25\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**RVLV - Earnings on Wednesday**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dx4hk495i3y51.png?width=1954&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e262fb8fd220ac069fb0b822e6b2030c88392ec9\n\nRevolve crushed earnings on their last report and the stock went up 25%. You can see the stock has been trading in channel (pink lines) and is sitting comfortably somewhere near the high portion of the channel. Each time the stock price exited the channel to the upside it was rejected and pulled right back down. Generally it takes a break-through of the supply zones (resistance) or a big event to exit a channel and form a new trend. If we see some downside from earnings we might get a bounce off the $18 level. I'll be selling some puts there.\n\n**Positions:** \n\n$18p for $0.85 premium will have return of $4.7%\n\nBreak-even reached if the stock drops below $17.15\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PTON - Earnings last week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tqfvpvl6i3y51.png?width=1956&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f4a5802a15a0769523eee117083da0b6805d19f\n\nPeloton reported earnings last week. Management summarized to us that demand was still very high and they had trouble keeping up with it. Pretty fucking solid. This stock is literally a meme, but I do think it will be bought up on any dips. IV is also pretty high so I'll be selling weekly puts at the $115 or $120 level when I get a chance.\n\n**Positions:** \n\n$120p at $2.25 premium for a return of 1.9%, break-even at $117.75\n\n$115p at $1.00 premium for a return of 0.85%, break-even at $114\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**V - Not earnings play**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ppd3x268i3y51.png?width=1836&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58093caef63d46861d8751d5ea4826d9c69135f0\n\nVisa is one of the more predictable stocks. The dip to $180 two weeks ago was an early Christmas gift. I didn't draw any channel zones with my magical crayons here because this thing just bounces back and forth between resistance and support zones. V is currently trading at the pinnacle of the resistance line. If it gets rejected expect another dip back to $195 or even $190. If it breaks through we might see a continuation in momentum all the way up to $215. Why? We might see some follow through on last week's move. All the other times it was rejected by $200 from July through August it was on small moves and lower volume.\n\n**Positions:**\n\nIV is low on Visa, personally I would just outright buy the shares here. You can sell the weekly $210 covered call for some extra pocket money. I doubt this will break-through by end of next week and if it does you've already won on your shares.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Pro Tip:** Cash-secured-puts are a much \"safer\" way to make money. There is a misconception about selling higher volume of credit spreads instead of 1 or 2 cash-secured-puts because when you lose on a credit spread you are realizing and accepting the loss. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nListen here folks, we will NEVER accept defeat. We might lose the battle and get assigned some shares of these ultra high-quality stocks, but we will ALWAYS win the war and come out profitable. See how I am aiming here for 1-3% on each of these plays. We are winners baby so lets make that bread.",

Our amazing people are helping our companies do amazing things.\" What's not amazing about that?   \n- But seriously, they have over 110 positions open in technology and 20 in project management   \n- 142 Sales and Marketing jobs  \n- Only 41 other non tech jobs  \n- So basically, tech and selling the tech. They are not slow stepping here and that's what I think Michael Burry saw.   \n- Check out their new site at www.lumen.com which is already getting 210,000 visitors a month (up from 2000 visitors on launch in august or 10,000% growth)\n- As our government and tech overlords continue to expand, the non tech companies will need a savior and that savior is Lumen. The same way PLTR is sucking up all the surveillance business, LUMN will suck up all the transformation business for big enterprises.   \n- Look at their featured customers: Salesforce, Zoom  \n- Now for some financials:  diluted EPS was $0.34 vs. $0.28 in 2019 and management says they are committed and focused on EPS with a three year goal of saving $800-$1b a year  \n- Next quarter they are going to way outperform in both actual numbers and sentiment because they will start to show growth rather than decline    \n- And Michael Burry's 800,000 are going to triple in value.  \n   \nLUMN 100 calls 12/18/20 @ $10 (already up like 50% on these)    \nLUMN 350 calls 4/16/21 @ $13",

        "selftext": " Originally posted on [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Q: I don\u2019t want to read. Can you summarize what you wrote below in one sentence?**\n\nMonday  will be the last day of $ZI\u2019s lockup period, meaning that from next  Tuesday on, 320 million of the locked shares will be allowed to be sold  to the public.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Q: What is $ZI?**\n\n**$ZI (Zoominfo) has nothing to do with $ZM (Zoom)**. **It has nothing to do with video conferencing or WFH**.  Zoominfo provides client relationship management solutions. For  example, it helps salespeople to find new leads and helps marketing  people to better target customers. Its business is similar to  Salesforce, albeit much smaller and with a narrower focus.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Q: How many shares are currently outstanding?**\n\n69 million\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Q: How many more shares will be unlocked?**\n\n320 million, or **4.6 times current outstanding shares**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Q: How many shares on average are traded each day?**\n\n30 day average volume is about 1.7 million. So **the unlocked shares are 188 times average trading volume**. Or in other words, **even if only 0.5% of these unlocked shares are sold, that is already more than entire day\u2019s trading volume.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Q: Do you have any proof?**\n\n[https://sec.report/Document/0001628280-20-009087/](https://sec.report/Document/0001628280-20-009087/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Q: What if nobody sells these unlocked shares because they think the share price is still low?**\n\n$ZI\u2019s IPO price is 21$, it is right now trading 51$, **or 245% of its IPO price**. Plus, **its IPO was priced above the range**. Almost every tech IPO was priced above the range this year due to the tech fever.\n\nIt has outperformed competitor $HUBS by 9% this week alone, for... no  reason at all. **It is even up by 9+% today because people are not aware  of the coming lockup expiry.** Thanks for the great short opportunity  though.\n\nLet\u2019s say you are an early investor or employee of $ZI. You made your investment or received stock  option pre-ipo. The share price you paid pre-ipo must be significantly  lower than IPO price 21$. Now, the share has gained 145% from even the  IPO price, meaning **it probably gained 300%, 400% from the price you paid. Would you choose to at least take some profits?**\n\nRemember, **even  if only 0.5% of these people choose to take profit, the selling  pressure will already be higher than a whole day\u2019s trading volume**\n\n.\n\n* **Q: What if nobody sells these unlocked shares because they think the fundamentals are undervalued?**\n\nPrice to sales ratio is 32.5, which is 3 times Salesforce\u2019s P/S 10 and twice Hubspot\u2019s P/S 17. I won\u2019t say it is undervalued.\n\nMore importantly, hey, wake up, this year is 2020. Nobody cares about valuation anymore. When people buy, price goes up. **When people sell, price goes down.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Q: How much can a stock fall when a big selling pressure is expected?**\n\nI will give you an opposite example. How much can a stock rise when a big buying pressure is expected?\n\n$TSLA\n\nS&amp;P  500 inclusion will create a $51 billion dollar, or roughly let\u2019s say  100 million shares $TSLA buying pressure. $TSLA trades more this week,  but its average daily volume is about 40 million shares. So the buying  pressure expected is about 2.5x daily volume. This inclusion will happen  on Dec. 18, so still more than 2 weeks away. Even tho it\u2019s still 2  weeks away, $TSLA has already risen 45% since the S&amp;P news.\n\nNow you can build your own expectation on how much $ZI can fall.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Q: If I want to sell the shares now, is it already too late?**\n\nIt has been up 45% this month. No significant retracement has happened yet. **Few people are even aware that this company exists, let alone its lockup is ending today.** So here I am writing to tell you that. If people knew about this, it would have shitted its bed already.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Q: But 2 weeks ago, Morgan Stanley upgraded their price target?**\n\nNothing  unexpected here. Morgan Stanley is the lead underwriter of $ZI. I am  yet to see any lead underwriter downgrades stocks it underwrote before  lockup expires. **These bankers**, who are going to make tens of millions of dollars this year even when the poor are losing jobs, **know how to keep their customers\u2019 happy.**\n\nThe stock has risen 25% after the upgrade. Even without a lockup expiry, a correction may still be expected. It\u2019s no $TSLA, **it does not have a meme status. A regular stock is unlikely to go one way up without hiccups.**\n\nOther  banks' like Barclays 12-month price target is even lower than current  trading price, and that is without considering the lockup release  impact.\n\nIf you trust Morgan  Stanley\u2019s price target simply because you trust the bank\u2019s name, it  would be logical to go YOLO on $MS and hold it forever. Why don\u2019t you do  that?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Q: So TLDR, should I sell the shares?**\n\nYou  are not 5 years old. Make your decision. If you think the unlocking  of 320 million shares will create a selling pressure, sell it. If you  think every single stock in the world should be worth 420.69$ as our  living Jesus Elon has hinted, then buy it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***You are welcome.***",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, November 25, 2020**\n\nAfter hitting record levels in the Dow and the S&amp;P, the market consolidated its gain, finishing the day even or slightly red. Ahead of the US Thanksgiving holiday, optimism over a relatively quick rollout of a coronavirus vaccine propelled the Dow Jones to above 30,000 points for the first time and the S&amp;P to record highs. The tech-heavy Nasdaq, which has been beaten down recently as market participants rotate to cyclical and reopening stocks also posted a strong week.\n\nCountering the optimism is the reality that the coronavirus pandemic has been surging the last few weeks, raising the specter of further restrictions. As of Tuesday, there 88,080 patients hospitalized with the coronavirus pandemic\n\nFinally, after four painful weeks, the surge in coronavirus infections are showing early signs of improvement. The national weekly average for daily new infections is 172,118, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. While that is an all-time record, it only represents an 11% increase to last week. In the past four weeks, average daily new infections were posting a roughly 30-40% increase every week. The daily average deaths are more than 1,500, similar level to early May.\n\nToday was a slow day, in terms of news. With Thanksgiving coming up, markets are closed tomorrow and open only half-day Friday\n\nThe political uncertainty in the United States is beginning to clear up. Weeks after Joe Biden was declared President-Elect, General Service Administration (GSA) head Emily Murphy acknowledged Biden\u2019s win and approved the official transition process. The GSA is a government agency that works largely behind the scenes to support other federal entities, with responsibility for managing federal office space, procuring supplies and improving the use of technology across the government. The GSA provides a presidential transition team with Washington office space and coordinates access to federal agencies to plan potential policy changes with current administration officials, using $6.3 million allocated to support its efforts. This will finally allow Biden\u2019s team to gain access to crucial information needed to effectively govern the nation. Mark Haefele, UBS Global chief investment officer, said, \u201cWe believe that the recent reduction in political uncertainty in the U.S., though far from complete, is another supportive factor behind the recent stock rally,\n\nMarkets were also encouraged by Biden\u2019s appointment of former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen to Treasury  Secretary. Yellen served as Fed Chair from 2014-2018, helping steer the historic bull market that followed the 2008 recession.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Tesla (TSLA) is issuing two recalls covering about 9,500 vehicles for roof trim that may separate and bolts that may not have been properly tightened.\n* A JPMorgan (JPM) unit was fined $250 million over historical failures to maintain adequate internal controls and internal audit over its fiduciary business \"for several years,\" the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said Tuesday. \n* Psychos, check out Subversive Capital (SBVCF),  the largest cannabis SPAC that just announced Jay-Z as Chief Visionary Officer. SPAC acquired both Caliva and Left Coast Ventures for $282.9 and $142.2 million. Deal set for Jan 2021.\n* Amazon (AMZN) reported an outage tied to its enormous cloud-computing operation that affected many customers. ROKU said it was affected.\n* Salesforce (CRM) in talks to buy Slack Technologies (WORK) though nothing certain yet.. Slack is up 30% on the rumor\n* Pure Storage (PSTG) with two target increases. Stock currently around $19.75.\n   * Keycorp from $20 to $23 OVERWEIGHT\n   * Barclays from $20 to $24 BUY\n* Jacobs Engineering (J) with multipl target raises. Stock around $108\n   * Benchmark at $120 BUY\n   * DA Davidson at $120 BUY\n   * Credit Suisse at $127 OUTPERFORM\n* FMC price target increased by UBS Group from $127 to $135. Stock currently around $118.\n* Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) target raised by Barclays from $70 to $80 at OVERWEIGHT. Stock currently around $59\n* Dell Technology (DELL) target raised by Raymond James from $69 to $85 at OUTPERFORM\n* Burlington (BURL) with two targe raises. Stock currently around $225.\n   * Barclays at $267 OVERWEIGHT\n   * Credit Suisse at $255 OUTPERFORM\n* Ameriprise Financial (AMP) with target raise from Credit Suisee from $194 to $227 at OUTPEFORM.

        "selftext": "Alright, autists, I know what you're thinking. \"WORK ALREADY WENT UP 37% WEDNESDAY AND YOU BRING THE DD NOW?\" Calm your tits and hear me out. 3 Reasons why WORK can continue to climb. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) ARKK's 6th largest holding (at 4.4% of the fund) is WORK. They even bought more WORK shares around $27 on 11/06. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d17og8c2tp161.png?width=2104&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac006decd09409efabbe6c4d01bb8c561eff51d9\n\nARK is known to sell some shares when a stock is hitting all time high and yet, they did not sell a single share on Wednesday. ARK must believe WORK is worth more and CRM will pay more than $40 for WORK. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2)  Software company acquisitions usually come at a premium of 30-50% which correlates to $39 to $45 per share for WORK. I believe CRM will pay $45 or more because CRM sees the value of integrating WORK in their suite of software. WORK acquisition will most likely double or even triple the value of WORK under CRM. CRM knows this and the board of WORK knows this. WORK will not be sold without a high premium.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) Amazon is a big customer of WORK and may want to acquire WORK instead of having to use CRM's software. Google is another player that could join in this bidding war which will surely pump WORK up to $50 or even $60 if this lasts a while. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck and may the tendie gods bless us. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPosition: $WORK  01/15/21 $45C",

Yes stocks are random, but from time to fucking time they bounce off zones of supply and demand also known as support and resistance you fucks. I've stopped going full autismo lately and have been mixing up my calls with some theta shit and guess what now my trading account is almost back to break-even after being down 20 G's in April.\n\nHere are the moves for the week. Purple lines indicate a channel the stock trades in, blue lines are the same color as your balls and represent hard lines of support, aka where the dip buyers come in to steal your shares after you've panic sold them like a little bitch. Typically when a stock goes outside the purple lines it reverts back to the mean at some point. The further it goes outside the channel, the faster it \\*might\\* get back inside the channel. This is well represented in the first chart below.\n\n**DOCU**  \n\n\nDOCU is one of the top covid plays and with shutdowns and bullshit coming full force, I like this stock right here. Not only that, but if any of you morons ever move out of your mom's basement and sign important documents, you will notice many agencies actually use this service. DOCU has dropped 20 fucking percent in one week and is trading at the bottom of the channel which leads me to believe this is a buy at these levels.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1qj10cx1gpw51.png?width=1944&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a06a51695220687d1094b1012f803f0b4c928878\n\n**JD**\n\nNext up we have JD.com which is like the SHOPIFY for China, except its better than shopify. If you've been following China and their GDP numbers you will see that they are on track to have the fastest recovery from covid. I don't give a fuck if the numbers are fake and the recovery is fake, they will need to pump fake earnings across the board to make it seem like everything is going well anyways. This stock right here is trading directly in the center of my imaginary purple lines which mean stonks might go up or down, but with earnings right around the corner you can bet your pet hamster this thing will be trading in the $90's soon.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m47w3qzwgpw51.png?width=1940&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=edf0a9d1d6cd1f721290ed87fd6b4004bba6caf4\n\n**CRM**\n\nCRM, also known as Salesforce, is a monster of a stock. The company is having explosive growth, and it's not because of covid but because they have a high quality lead-generation product that almost every profitable business wants to use. We are trading at the very bottom of this channel and are almost back to the price of last earnings report. I like this setup because I see maybe a 10% downside, but I also see infinity upside. That's what I call a win-win situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/97mo9i4nhpw51.png?width=1946&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25d07e70e8343b1faf04b6955514881a6ed624c4\n\n**PYPL earnings YOLO**\n\nLastly, lets look at Paypal. This company has been scamming users for fee's since before you were even born... but guess what. If we look at Shopify's earnings report we will see that e-commerce is absolutely fucking booming. Right now there are only 2-3 payment methods that have a monopoly on online purchases. It's either your wife's boyfriend's credit card, stripe, or fucking paypal. Shopify sales booming, amazon sales booming, all around e-commerce is booming, and paypal will reap benefits until the growth begins to slow... we can thank this virus for breathing life into this shit-stronk. This ticker is also trading right at the bottom of the range due to this massive decline we just saw last week. Lots of buying opportunities came about, but too bad you all only had 15 cents left in your account.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/esw4h790ipw51.png?width=1942&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a996d52c0eb89604573f84ec936783e24bdc47b4\n\nThanks for listening to my TED talk.

        "selftext": "I'm back r/stocks with my plays this week. Last week I closed out half my positions and left a few on the table waiting for them to hit my targets. Since I still have some of my positions open from last week I made my watchlist longer for this week to keep an eye out on plays that become within my level. I've also had a lot of DMs asking for plays that can be used on a smaller account so I've included some tickers that require less capital to sell cash-secured-puts. These are simply positions I might be entering based on my own due diligence and analysis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What am I doing?**\n\nI do technical analysis and selling cash-secured-puts 1 to 4 weeks out on stocks that are nearing key levels of support. My goal is to collect premium, but should I get assigned I have absolutely zero problem running the wheel on stocks I want to own. As a backstory I nearly blew up my account doing WSB-style plays in March but have regained all of my account and then some running this strategy since April. What I do now is basically wheeling on weekly puts.\n\nI watch over 200 stocks, I would say its 90% waiting game and 10% true technical analysis. My levels work, but it's normally because I am patiently waiting for an entry point. Yes that's a lot of tickers to watch, but I research my stocks on weekends and then monitor additional plays &amp; levels during the weekday to see if there is an obvious setup I want to participate in.\n\n# Here's a few things regarding my strategy\n\n**1.** I don't over-leverage with spreads because if the stock price blows past your long strike and you assume max loss you need a lot of capital to actually be assigned the shares. For that reason I don't really see selling multiple spreads as a \"Theta Gang\" play and is still very high risk. If I do open a spread it will be a protective put for $1-5 just to protect myself should the company randomly announce bankruptcy.\n\n**2.** I only sell cash-secured puts with the capability to be assigned if need be. My goal is to never take a loss on a position and always wheel it back to profitability. If something has changed fundamentally with the stock then yes I will close the position and realize the loss.\n\n**3.** If IV on a ticker is very low, then yes I will outright buy shares instead.\n\n**4.** I only aim for 1-4% per week collecting on theta and an occasional earnings theta yolo. No call-buying, no spreads, only put-selling and shares!\n\nHonestly, that's about it. I'll go through some tickers on my watchlist this weekend and what I currently have open.\n\n# Open Positions From Last Week\n\n**FB:** 1x 18 Dec, 2020 $260 put sold to open. Up 50% on this option I sold, looking to sell early this week if we get a good pop and close it out at 60-70%.\n\n**MSFT:** Holding 100 shares. Up 1.75% on the position. Stock sitting at $215, my short-term price target is around $218-220 before I look into selling the position.\n\n**NVDA:** 30 shares. Up 0.24% on the position. Looking for $550 here.\n\n**PTON:** 1x 11 Dec 2020 $101 put sold to open. Up 25% here will look to close at around 50-70% profit range.\n\n# Chart Rules\n\n**Pink Lines** = Trading range &amp; channel. I find stocks typically trade within certain channels until an event, such as earnings or some news which changes the fundamentals of the stock price changes the trend and a new channel is formed.\n\n**Blue Lines** = Key areas of support/resistance. I don't like focusing on supp/res levels every $2 down like some people do. I look at the bigger picture and find where where key levels of buyers come in to grab the stock. I'll try to sell puts there.\n\n# Master Plays This Week (Stock price in parenthesis)\n\n**CRM Salesforce ($248) - Earnings theta yolo**\n\n[CRM CHART](https://imgur.com/uTjMgNF)\n\nCRM has been the powerhouse is customer relations management throughout covid. High quality product that is converting more and more businesses into clients. Earnings are coming up this week so premiums will be juicy. The stock has been consolidating in a volatile range for about 2 months now. Uptrend still intact and close to the $240 support level where we will find some buyers. I'll be looking to enter a position here.\n\n**Positions I'm watching:**\n\n**1.** 1x Dec 11 2020, $240 strike put, sold to open for $7.60 or $760 premium. Return: 3% in 2 weeks. \\*I'm selling the 0.33 delta put here. You can go to a lower strike and lower delta, maybe even $235 here and still get decent return.\n\n**2.** Shares with PT to $280.\n\n**TDOC Teladoc ($196)**\n\n[TDOC CHART](https://imgur.com/NC6WSKs)\n\nI entered TDOC a couple weeks ago and made a quick 2-3% return on my play in just 2 or 3 days after the stock price shot up. It's trading a little higher than when I entered my position last time, but still near the bottom of the trend channel (pink lines). I think anything close to $190 is a good entry point. I'll be keeping an on it and look to sell a 0.30 delta put option 4 weeks out if the timing is right.\n\n**Positions I'm watching:**\n\n**1.** 1x Dec 24 2020, $185 strike put, sold to open for $7.00 or $700 premium. Return: 3.7% in 4 weeks.\n\n**2.** Shares with PT to $210-$215\n\n**PTON Peloton ($109)**\n\n[PTON CHART](https://imgur.com/Rl0L7pJ)\n\nI already have a position in PTON open. I sold a put when it was down 6% in a single day last week. I think anywhere sub-$100 level there will be buying pressure to keep it up. When it broke out to $140 it quickly reversed back to the mean stock price and into the channel. Weird how that works ;) Looking at the chart would you buy the stock when it the stock price was going vertically up from $100 to $140? I try to avoid buying on vertical lines unless it's a vertical line down on a stock ticker I like. The trend is still up here even though it has wild swings. Eventually this ticker will lose it's juicy premiums when volatility goes down. I'll try to capture some theta in the mean time.\n\n**Positions I'm watching:**\n\n**1.** 1x Dec 24 2020, $101 strike put, sold to open for $4.45 or $445 premium. Return: 4.4% in 4 weeks.\n\n**2.** Shares with PT back to $120.\n\n**FSLY Fastly ($85)**\n\n[FSLY CHART](https://imgur.com/x0QFpVj)\n\nFSLY also trading in a range approaching that $85 resistance level. It might take off, but if it doesn't I will look to sell a put option around the $78 strike where I think we can find some buyers for the stock. This is another ticker that has volatile swings, but also has been trading steady in a range. Looking at charts like this helps me see where the stock is going and what it is doing. If you look at the daily or intraday you lose sight of these things because it has such wide swings. This will lead you to easily being spooked out of your positions or selling too soon.\n\n**Positions I'm watching:**\n\n**1.** 1x Dec 24 2020, $78 strike put, sold to open for $3.75 or $375 premium. Return: 4.8% in 4 weeks.\n\n**2.** Shares with PT up to $95.\n\n**PRPL Purple Mattress ($30)**\n\n[PRPL CHART](https://imgur.com/ccdQhGV)\n\nPRPL is outside the trend lines and outperforming and also right at the resistance line. Sounds cliche, but the stock will either continue up and outside the range, where I will not touch it, or come back down to the $26-28 range where I will look to sell some puts. IV is still high on this ticker and makes premiums good to sell on. Will need to see where the stock goes this week before any decisions are made.\n\n**Positions I'm watching:**\n\nWaiting for a dip and for the stock price to come back into the channel. Waiting.\n\n**GME Gamestop ($16)**\n\n[GME CHART](https://imgur.com/LjpQ9Ie)\n\nThe possibilities where this stock can go are infinite. Premiums sky high. Strong support at $11 and we have some at the $14 range. If we get another up day of 10% tomorrow I won't touch this stock, otherwise I might sell some puts 4-6 weeks out and try to capitalize on the crazy IV this ticker has. This is a higher risk, higher reward play that I am willing to take. Why? Short interest is sky high. When the stock price increases, shorts will cover their losses which will squeeze the stock higher. If the stock price goes down, we will see some dip buyers and also potentially some shorts closing positions for break-even.\n\n**Positions I'm watching:**\n\n**1.** I will look to sell puts at an appropriate strike when the time comes. If the stock is up 10% Monday I won't chase it.\n\n# Long-term holds I am watching\n\nPLTR (Palantir) and AAPL (Apple Inc). Unfortunately AAPL has terrible premiums so I can't collect any theta on it, but I do like the pricing point going into the holidays. Some of the main tech stocks have been under-performing for some time. I think there is a good opportunity to get some before they begin to take-off again.\n\nI did some research on Palantir stock this weekend and I gotta say I like it. The stock has almost tripled in just a few weeks, but I will be looking to enter some long-term positions in shares if or when the stock dips.",

        "selftext": "  \n\n'Allo mes amis \n\nI threw some spare change at this company early on (euros of course, none of your colonial monopoly money) and got some reasonable growth already. \n\nis this a long term play for you chaps or more of a speculation? One argument i hear is that there are other companies doing the same thing more profitably who can take market share from them.\n\nMy take here is that pltr is becoming more entrenched in the security infrastructure and this will help them organically grow their business in this space so everyone in 5 eyes/nato etc is talking the same language (so to speak). I'm quite bullish here. let's also bear in mind that relationships will play a role here.\n\nPrivate sector-wise we've heard/read all the stuff about BP and the airline company saving loada millions in 5 minutes. There's more competition in this space all the way from free power BI for tiny companies to more powerful solutions from providers like salesforce (tableau), cognizant, splunk. I'm less bullish here but if the product is as good as they say then they should gain traction here over time. This last bit's super important. Any insight here would be great.\n\nIn terms of business model you have sticky revenue and sticky clients who probably don't want to redo  their software every year. Probably a relatively long sales cycle and it's b2b not b2c - i'm curious to see the q4 results.\n\nPutting this altogether this seems like more of a slow burning value play than something that will spike short term.

        "selftext": "**What happened last week in the stock market? What are the next interesting earnings reports? Let\u2019s talk about the stock market!**\n\nHey everyone and Welcome so let\u2019s start with the recap of what has happened in the stock market since Monday.\n\nMonday the [DOW](https://ibb.co/ryHzJ3C) rose by more than 1,12% with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/PG8CcgX) also gaining more than half a percent while the [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/Qfwj6QX) was the laggard barely up 0,2% to finish the day while The [VIX](https://ibb.co/SdCNtBZ) had another big drop closing at 22.2. About 70% of the companies were gaining while 80% were trading over 50 and 200-day moving averages. The stock market was lead by the energy sector, which saw a major spike of almost 5% with Financials and Industrials also up more than 1% for the day. The rally was pushed mostly by small and mid-cap value stocks while large-cap growth companies were lagging as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/Kbvv08B) with the biggest company in the world, Apple, dragging down the sector, down almost 3% for the day. [CHART](https://ibb.co/LSxy7Mj) / [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/ZHYXxRW) / [CHART](https://ibb.co/pynTjjH)\n\nReports also came in on Monday that the PS5 and the new xBox have been sold out the moment they are available in stock, as the two gaming consoles are enjoying great demand, this bolds well for the parent companies Sony and Microsoft especially if they can keep up with the demand for this holiday season including Black Friday, holiday [RETAIL SALES](https://ibb.co/J2vDV3F) are forecasted to rise between 3,6 and 5,2%. [XBOX &amp; PS5 NEWS](https://ibb.co/qFMvRz5)\n\nAll this while Europe will start to re-open again after a contraction of the economy due to the latest lockdowns. As they saw the Eurozone PMI falling by almost 4% in October. [EUROZONE NEWS](https://ibb.co/8DFqbd7)\n\nSome good news came from [STORE CAPITAL](https://ibb.co/rHy6pGj) as the rent collections for November remained at 90% with no new tenants requiring deferrals, this suggests that companies are managing to survive even with the current restrictions in place.\n\nWe also saw reports that Janet Yellen will be the next Treasury pick as she would become the first person to be at the top of the FED the White House Council of Economic Advisers and the Treasury and she will become the first woman to lead the Treasury. [TREASURY NEWS](https://ibb.co/bRyZk8G)\n\nMoving on, Tuesday we saw the [DOW](https://ibb.co/K0SW54V) spike more than 1,5%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/8j7WcXs) rising 1,6% and the [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/S7D4MJ3) up more than 1,3% in what was a very good day for the stock market with more than 70% of companies advancing and 167 new highs on above average volume. The leaders were once again Energy and Financials, as this 2 sectors, will be two of the fastest benefiting from the end of the pandemic. The rally was continued with value companies leading the way for the 2nd straight day. You can struggle to find red spots in the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/FgNk2rg)  from Tuesday but there were a few in healthcare and real estate. This was the first time that the [DOW](https://ibb.co/C7dYJVD) closed over 30k. [CHART](https://ibb.co/FHmJRYw) / [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/C2WXYW6) / [CHART](https://ibb.co/S5DbTNV)\n\n[NIKOLA](https://ibb.co/M15WTJ4) stock tumbled after the recent rally as the GM deal seems less likely every day, as the deadline for the deal is December 3rd.\n\nWhile October [HOME SEARCHES](https://ibb.co/8PVX9KT) surged over 200% as a Redfin report shows, this leads me to believe that the strong housing demand will keep remaining at this levels for a good period of time. \n\nOn Wednesday we saw the stock market take a breather, as the [DOW](https://ibb.co/0f0Xt8g) lost 0,6%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/LYdGYSz) lost 0,16% while the pandemic plays regained some momentum with the [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/37Y7qGX) being up almost half a percent before the stock market closed for Thanksgiving.\n\nAbout 54% of companies were losing ground with below average volume for the day, as Technology and consumer discretionary and staples were the gainers for the day. Value plays did see some normal corrections after the huge gains in the last days as investors were cashing out some money probably before the day off. [CHART](https://ibb.co/pW4g7g4) / [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/ZJxg1MW) / [CHART](https://ibb.co/zhGhJMB)\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/PDyDqBb) from Wednesday as only a couple of companies Like Amazon, Apple, Nvidia and Shopify were gaining, while the energy sector was the biggest laggard.\n\nAlso the AAII investor sentiment [SURVEY](https://ibb.co/CM9RsDQ) from Wednesday showed that people are getting more bearish or bullish as the neutral feeling fell way below the historical average as bullishness remains very high. This is usually a contrarian indicator, as more bullishness gives me reason to take profits and bearishness to invest in the stock market, though I don\u2019t have the same confidence in this as in the past, as I expect this market rally to last until the end of next year.\n\nNews came in from Delta Airlines as pilots approved pay cuts and lower guaranteed hours that could avoid more than 1700 pilots getting cut off. This are great news both for the company and the pilots, as air travel will pick up again in the next years. [DELTA NEWS](https://ibb.co/PmHQMDf)\n\nAlso, Deere reported blowout [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/z4C2L6S) and a beat of more than 1$ per share and a revenue only 0,6% below last year while also issuing strong 2021 forecasts as they see the equipment sales climbing more than 10% compared to 2020 with a strong net income guidance of 3,6 to 4 billion $ compared to the May guidance of 1,6 to 2 billion $. [4Q 2020](https://ibb.co/FKNjHKs) / [2021](https://ibb.co/PT8GhBW)\n\nWe closed the week on a short day on Friday as the [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/8PXVwTT) led the way up 0,93%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/6Pgyrd9) up 0,24% and the [DOW](https://ibb.co/82j8ft0) barely up 0,13%. As we saw about 55% of the companies advancing on way below average volume due to the short day of trading with 85% of companies trading below average volumes. Friday was a pretty divided day as Health Care and Tech lead the way while Utilities and Energy saw a slight pullback after the big gains this week. [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/s3n9Sdb) / [CHART](https://ibb.co/Ldx38vW) / \n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/TggK0j5) from Friday as we see that the market was dragged higher by the big tech companies and communication services while the rest of the market was pretty much lagging.\n\nSo for the week, the Nasdaq lead the way up 3% and closed at the 45th record of 2020, the SP followed up 2,3% and closed a 26th record of the year with the DOW also rising 2% in this shortened week. While the [VIX](https://ibb.co/n6M1Z9k) closed the week just below 21, at the lowest level since February.\n\nSo great signs for the recovery of the economy still popped up almost every day, as the stock market is more forward looking than it is a reflection of the current economic conditions. As November will likely be the 7th straight month of job gains, though they will be the fewest in number since the recovery of jobs has begun. [NOVEMBER JOBS](https://ibb.co/ZVMDxtr)\n\nAlso, Bitcoin has seen its price drop from almost all-time highs at 19,5k down more than 3k before bouncing back to around 17k. The cryptocurrency was due for a correction as it had seen a huge rally in since Labor Day and this correction came as news popped of the Treasury attempting to rush out regulation on crypto-wallets. This would be a big negative factor for people who own Bitcoin not for just it\u2019s value but for using it also. But we will have to wait and see as the Treasury boss will be replaced when the Presidency changes. [BITCOIN NEWS](https://ibb.co/FhpVSjC) / [BITCOIN CHART](https://ibb.co/myVqJzN)\n\nSome company news from Friday were that [PALANTIR](https://ibb.co/hDMN8vz) saw it\u2019s stock plunge from all time high of 33,5$ to 27,6$ after Citron tweeted that they are shorting the stock with a 20$ price target. This are common tactics that short sellers use in my opinion to get the fast results they expected. Citron also got into a short position on NIO recently and that news also made the stock take a plunged but that has since recovered and even made new all time highs since.\n\nGreat news came for sports betting companies like DraftKings and Penn national as Canada seems to be going the same way as the US as legalizing sports betting advances more and more. [CANADA NEWS](https://ibb.co/6F20V4W)\n\nAlso, Tesla has seen a huge spike in the last weeks since the SP500 news, and the stock might see another spike as Musk [TWEETED](https://ibb.co/qyLQXRp) that the full self-driving feature will be released wider in the next weeks as the company finally approaches the end of software development as they collect more and more data. Tesla has surpassed Berkshire and is now the 6th largest company in the US as the stock is up more than 600% year to date making Elon Musk the second richest person in the world behind only Bezos. The company will go into the SP500 index at about 80% of its total market value cap as the index only counts the free-floating shares. I believe we won\u2019t see such a big spike in price when the company will be added to the SP in December, just like it happened with the stock split its more of a buy the news sell the event type of thing. As I expected the stock jumped over the previous all time highs and it might see a little correction when the event actually happens, but in the long run this a company that I will continue to own in my portfolio. [TESLA CHART](https://ibb.co/S3w4YVD) / [MUSK WEALTH](https://ibb.co/b6xRMZL) / \n\nNext week we will have some interesting earnings reports that I expect to beat the estimates from companies like [NEXT WEEK EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/6yNcM9m)\n\n[AUTOHOME](https://ibb.co/nQ08V04) which is a company that has great potential as it trades at a low P/E, they offer leads and services for auto consumers in China and they have a very wide consumer base to spread to.\n\nWith [ZOOM](https://ibb.co/br3pPJC) also expecting to report on Monday after the close, I recently just sold out of my position in Zoom. I think there is too much positive expectations for the company as it trade at almost 200 times earnings per shares.\n\nAlso, [Salesforce](https://ibb.co/D5dwYYW) are expected to announce earnings on Tuesday, as the company saw it\u2019s stock tumble after the news of a possible acquiring of Slack.

This is where they started, but today they actually make more money from their other lines of business -- services cloud (post-sales CRM), a cloud computing solution, and marketing + sales SaaS software. Those areas are also growing more quickly. (See [Section 2 in their latest 10Q](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1108524/000110852420000041/crm-20200731.htm).)\n\nI think this is where their true long-term potential comes in.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 30th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks on track to close out month of big gains as jobs data looms  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/27/stocks-on-track-to-close-out-month-of-big-gains-next-week-as-jobs-data-looms.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks next week will come off one of their best months ever into a busy week of economic data and the ongoing tensions between the spreading virus and positive news on vaccines and treatments.\n*****\n&gt; Another highlight of the week is expected to be Tuesday\u2019s testimony from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin before the Senate Banking Committee. They will be discussing the emergency measures taken to help the economy after the outbreak of the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow was up nearly 13% for November so far, and if it holds its gains into Monday\u2019s close, it will chalk up its best month since January, 1987. The S&amp;P 500 closed at a record 3,638 and was up 11.3% for the month. The gain is its best performance since April\u2019s 12.7%, which was the third best month for the S&amp;P 500 since its origin in 1957.\n*****\n&gt; November was a big month also for market rotation, with investors favoring stocks that would benefit from a rebounding economy and showing less love for long-held favorites among big tech and internet names. Financials were up more than 17% in the past month, and industrials rose nearly 15%, as investors bet vaccines would help the economy return to normal next year.\n*****\n&gt; Tech notched a single digit gain for the month so far and lagged the broader market. But some strategists expect big tech and internet names, stay-at-home stocks, to fare better in December.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe death of big tech has been announced over and over again, and we see that the market doesn\u2019t abandon them, but in fact migrates to big tech whenever there are concerns,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \u201cThe post-pandemic question is whether big tech can co-exist with the small and mid-cap.\u201d Small caps were one of the biggest winners in November, with the Russell 2000, up 20.6%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe did not see major selling in Nasdaq,\u201d as investors put funds in cyclicals and value, she said. Nasdaq was up 11.9% for the month so far, slightly better than the S&amp;P 500.\n*****\n&gt; Experts have warned that there could an even bigger surge in virus cases, following the Thanksgiving holiday which could start to show up in the coming week. There have been more than 12.6 million cases in the U.S.\n*****\n&gt; # Jobs report\n&gt; There are some important economic reports in the week ahead, the most important being Friday\u2019s November employment report. There is is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMy thought here is the data is going to matter because if you listen to the Fed, and if you read through the Fed\u2019s minutes, they\u2019re in transition here. They\u2019re becoming more concerned about the rise in Covid cases, certainly about the lack of fiscal support,\u201d said Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists say another key report will be weekly jobless claims, which showed an increase in each of the last two weeks. \u201cThe employment data clearly has been weakening,\u201d said Faranello. If it continues, it will keep a lid on Treasury yields, which move opposite prices.\n*****\n&gt; Jefferies economist Tom Simons expects the elimination of Census Bureau workers to detract from the job gains in November, and he forecasts the economy added just 340,000 jobs.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt is hard to envision a particularly strong report coming out on Friday,\u201d noted Simons.\n*****\n&gt; Bank of America economists forecast just 150,000 payrolls were added for November, compared to 638,000 in October. The private sector is expected to add 300,000, but expected government layoffs impacted total payrolls in their forecast.\n*****\n&gt; Faranello said he expects the bond market to be much more active than normal this December because of the pending change in the White House, as well as the runoff election in Georgia Jan. 5 that will decide whether Republicans keep their Senate majority. The market has also been concerned about the lack of stimulus from Washington.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe theme in the market right now is definitely hope and optimism versus the on the ground dynamic with Covid,\u201d said Faranello. \u201cThe real question is can the vaccine rally hold up if we see the virus rise and we continue to see shutdowns. How does the market perform in light of that?\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said she expects the market to watch for vaccine news. \u201cThe question I think is now whether or not we see the emergency authorization given to Pfizer and followed by Moderna,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that is a catalyst to the market because that is when you will start to see the vaccine distributed.\u201d The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s vaccine advisory committee has a meeting set for Dec. 10 to discuss emergency authorization for the Pfizer\n*****\n&gt; Analysts expect investors to continue to gravitate to value and cyclicals, since they could have the biggest gains compared to already high priced big tech. But tech is still attractive.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe still see the Nasdaq leading,\u201d said Krosby. \u201cWhereas we enjoyed the vaccine related boom in the market, the fact is that investors and and traders are looking for big tech names to give them that growth in earnings and revenues.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ZTiIHZf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/kSw4HNb.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/oXE2aJo.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/30Iefrr.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/TEArZTK.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BzpCasV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2DhrB6V.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cRtEdkM.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ShSvr9G.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/e5ILGPd.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/e5ILGPd.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # December Almanac: Small Caps Have Shined\n\n&gt; December is now the number three S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials month since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% on each index. It\u2019s the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and third best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000 (1979). In 2018, DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of 2018 is not highly likely. When December is down it is usually a turning point in the market\u2014near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half of the month.\n\n&gt; In the last seventeen election years, December\u2019s ranking changed modestly to #2 DJIA, #5 NASDAQ, but S&amp;P 500 remains #3. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, have had a field day in election-year Decembers. Since 1980, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just once in ten election years in December. The average small cap gain in all ten years is a solid 3.0%. The Russell 2000\u2019s single loss was in 1980 when the Prime Rate was 21.5%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a451723116af31d8c7273c588c33b6c8/950092ad30c7af73-09/s400x600/360e0edef191c0c34d744f4a5ecd32fd8845da9d.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sector Weights Rising and Falling\n\n&gt; For most of the past year, one significant trend on a sector by sector basis has been the outperformance of sectors like Technology and Consumer Discretionary. The relative strength lines of these sectors have consistently shown outperformance versus the rest of the S&amp;P 500 as a whole, but since August, other sectors have begun to take the wheel. As we noted in today's Sector Snapshot, just about every sector has had a banner month in November with some of the biggest month to date rallies of the past 30 years, but some sectors have seen much larger returns than others. One of the best examples of this has been Energy which has risen over 35% in November. Similarly, Financials has risen an astounding 19.5% this month compared to more modest but still significant rallies of around 10% from Tech and Consumer Discretionary. Given those large degrees of outperformance, the relative strength lines of Energy and Financials have taken a sharp turn higher in recent weeks. Similarly, they have seen a turnaround in their weightings in the S&amp;P 500 as shown in the charts below.\n\n&gt; Over the past three months, the Financial sector has gained a full percentage point weighting while the Technology sector has lost 1.36 percentage points with a decline in weighting in three straight months. For Financials, that is the largest gain in weighting in a three month span since January 2017. For Tech, outside of the reshuffling in 2018 that saw a large share of its weight change into Communication Services, the last time the sector lost this much or more in weighting in three months was November of 2008. Prior to this recent string of losing weight over the past three months, Tech had seen weight gain in every month from October of last year through August. Even though the weight loss has been significant, it has only put a dent in the increased share of the entirety of the past year as the sector's weight is only back down to where it was in May.\n\n&gt; Similarly, looking at the other sectors, while Financials have added a full percentage point in share over the past few months, that follows nine months of declines running from last December through August. That brings the sector's weighting back above 10% in the S&amp;P 500, but that is only at the highest level since March. Similarly, Materials and Industrials have also seen their weights rise for three and four months in a row, respectively. As for Energy, the 0.44 percentage point gain in November is set to snap six straight months of declines; the longest such streak since at least 1990. As with Financials, that turn around this month has only put a dent in the longer term trend of weight loss as Energy's weighting is now only back to its highest level since July. Opposite of Energy, Consumer Discretionary is on pace to lose weight for the first time since March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/112720-Sector-Weights.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # A Month to Be Thankful For\n\n&gt; Heading into today with just three trading days left in November, the average Russell 1,000 stock was up 17.44% month to date. As shown below, not one of the five largest stocks is up even close to 17% on the month. For a market that had recently been driven higher in large part because of the five mega-cap Tech names, November has seen the mega-caps stall a bit while the rest of the market has seen broad participation. This is the type of breadth that market bulls have been waiting and hoping for.\n\n&gt; Of the 35 largest stocks in the Russell 1,000, Tesla (TSLA) is up the most so far this month with a gain of 43%. The other big winners include Chevron (CVX), JP Morgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Disney (DIS), and Comcast (CMCSA). Not one stock in the top 35 is down on the month, but the ones that are up the least are Netflix (NFLX), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Amazon (AMZN), and Home Depot (HD).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/largeststocks.png))**\n\n&gt; Looking at sectors, the average Energy stock in the Russell 1,000 is up 46% month-to-date but still down 27% year-to-date. Three other sectors have seen their stocks average MTD gains of more than 20%: Financials, Industrials, and Real Estate. Stocks in the Health Care and Utilities sectors are up the least on an average basis this month, but even these underperformers are still up more than 5%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/avgpctchg.png))**\n\n&gt; There are 37 stocks in the Russell 1,000 up more than 50% so far in November. Below is a list of this month's biggest winners. Coty (COTY) and Nordstrom (JWN) stand out the most with gains of more than 100%, followed by Spirit AeroSystems (SPR), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Diamondback Energy (FANG), and Empire State Realty (ESRT). The list of biggest winners this month is full of names that got hit hardest by COVID in areas like energy, travel, retail, and real estate. Notably, while these stocks are up an average of 68.5% in November, they're still down an average of 23% on the year. On a median basis, they're down even more year-to-date at -31.55%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/best-mtd.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Biden - Best Since Reagan\n\n&gt; The market started off November on a positive note, and even after the election has continued to add to its gains. Through the close today (11/24), the S&amp;P 500 is up 7.90% since the close on Election Day. Relative to every other Presidential election since the beginning of the S&amp;P back in 1928, the three-week performance of the S&amp;P 500 following this Election Day ranks as the second-best of all time. It came down right to the wire, but the only other US President to see a stronger market reaction to their election (or re-election) was Ronald Reagan in 1980 (7.97%). Behind Reagan and Biden, the only other Presidents where the S&amp;P 500 experienced an upside move of 5%+ in reaction to their elections were Hoover in 1928 and Clinton in 1996.\n\n&gt; On the downside, the most negative reaction of the market in the three weeks after Election Day was the 14.75% decline following President Obama's election in 2008. In addition to Obama, the S&amp;P 500's four other three-week downside moves of more than 5% came after the elections of Truman in 1948, the election of George W Bush in 2000 (although at the time it was unknown who was the winner of that election), the election of Franklin D Roosevelt in 1932, and Dwight D Eisenhower's re-election in 1956.\n\n&gt; In aggregate, the S&amp;P 500 hasn't historically responded all that great in the three weeks after a Presidential election. For every one since 1928, the median return of the S&amp;P 500 in the three weeks after Election Day has been a gain of just 0.35%. Breaking out returns by party, in the three weeks after a Democratic candidate is elected, the S&amp;P 500's median performance is a decline of 1.11% compared to a median gain of 3.04% when a Republican is elected.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/112420-President.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # DJIA 1,000 Point Thresholds\n\n&gt; What a wild year 2020 has been! With the DJIA closing above 30,000 today, it was the second first-time upside break of a 1,000 point threshold this year. While there have only been two new upside crosses of 1,000 point thresholds, due to the sharp pullback in March from the pandemic that briefly took the DJIA below 19,000 on a closing basis, there have actually been 12 different upside 1,000 point thresholds at some point in the year.\n\n&gt; The table below lists the first time that the DJIA closed above each 1,000 point threshold in its history along with the total number of times the index has crossed that level on a closing basis throughout history. The thousand point level that has seen the most crosses on a closing basis was 11,000 (87 crosses) while 10,000 ranks second at 67.\n\n&gt; Obviously, the higher the DJIA goes, the less impactful a move of 1,000 points becomes. At current levels, 1,000 points represents just 3.3%, which is really nothing more than a very bad day in the market. Given the diminishing impact of 1,000 points in the DJIA these days, their significance declines. Even still, the twelve new 1,000-point crosses since the 2016 election has given the President (who has publicly discussed the stock market more than any other President in history) plenty of ammunition to tweet about.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/112420-1000-Points-Threshold.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 30,000 Reasons To Be Thankful\n\n&gt; As 2020 winds down, it has been an extremely tough year on all of us. Still, there are many reasons to be thankful and today we will share some reasons investors should be thankful.\n\n&gt; Stocks have had one of the largest reversals ever in 2020, something to be thankful for. In fact, this could be the first year ever to see the S&amp;P 500 down more than 30% peak-to-trough and finish higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.25.20-Revised-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We should also be thankful that Congress was split in 2020, likely marking the 11th consecutive year the S&amp;P 500 gained under a split Congress. Gridlock is good they tell us and that very well could be true yet again.\n\n&gt; Want something else to be thankful for? We likely will have a split Congress for another two years after the two Georgia runoffs are official.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-2-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Let\u2019s be thankful that it is looking like stocks once again will be higher the year a President is up for re-election. In fact, you have to go back to FDR in the \u201840s the last time the S&amp;P 500 was lower for the year when a President was up for re-election.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-3-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Let\u2019s be thankful that the fastest bear market in history (only 16 days) is officially a thing of the past.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-4-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We are thankful that we are in a new bull market, which if history plays out once again, could have a lot of life left to it. In fact, the average bull market has lasted more than five years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-5-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cLet\u2019s be thankful that the huge move off the March lows was a major clue of more strength,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWe noted at the time (many different ways) that the enormous move we saw off the March lows likely suggested significantly higher prices, while many ignored the market signals and instead looked for a re-test for months on end.\u201d\n\n&gt; The 20-days off the March lows was the second best 20-day rally ever and sure enough, the returns have been very strong.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-6-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We are finally seeing many stocks participate in this bull market, another reason to be thankful. In fact, the Value Line Arithmetic Index recently made new all-time highs. This index is a great look at what the \u2018average\u2019 stock is doing and is a sign that this move isn\u2019t being led by just a few large cap tech stocks.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-7-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Let\u2019s be thankful that the NYSE Cumulative Advance/Decline line is at new highs.

As we move into \u201921, this is one group we think could continue to do quite well for investors.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-9-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Global investors should be thankful, as the MSCI Global Index broke out to new highs as well, suggesting this rally isn\u2019t only about the US anymore.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-10-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We upgraded our view on small caps in September and the Russell 2000 Index is currently on pace to have its best monthly return ever. Investors should be thankful that this group is finally participating, as there are many more small caps than large caps, another sign of improving breadth, while small caps are also more domestic by nature and could be suggesting a strong US economy next year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-11-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Investors should be thankful for the incredible strength around the election, as the S&amp;P 500 gained more than 1% four consecutive days.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 30th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks on track to close out month of big gains as jobs data looms  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/27/stocks-on-track-to-close-out-month-of-big-gains-next-week-as-jobs-data-looms.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks next week will come off one of their best months ever into a busy week of economic data and the ongoing tensions between the spreading virus and positive news on vaccines and treatments.\n*****\n&gt; Another highlight of the week is expected to be Tuesday\u2019s testimony from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin before the Senate Banking Committee. They will be discussing the emergency measures taken to help the economy after the outbreak of the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow was up nearly 13% for November so far, and if it holds its gains into Monday\u2019s close, it will chalk up its best month since January, 1987. The S&amp;P 500 closed at a record 3,638 and was up 11.3% for the month. The gain is its best performance since April\u2019s 12.7%, which was the third best month for the S&amp;P 500 since its origin in 1957.\n*****\n&gt; November was a big month also for market rotation, with investors favoring stocks that would benefit from a rebounding economy and showing less love for long-held favorites among big tech and internet names. Financials were up more than 17% in the past month, and industrials rose nearly 15%, as investors bet vaccines would help the economy return to normal next year.\n*****\n&gt; Tech notched a single digit gain for the month so far and lagged the broader market. But some strategists expect big tech and internet names, stay-at-home stocks, to fare better in December.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe death of big tech has been announced over and over again, and we see that the market doesn\u2019t abandon them, but in fact migrates to big tech whenever there are concerns,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \u201cThe post-pandemic question is whether big tech can co-exist with the small and mid-cap.\u201d Small caps were one of the biggest winners in November, with the Russell 2000, up 20.6%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe did not see major selling in Nasdaq,\u201d as investors put funds in cyclicals and value, she said. Nasdaq was up 11.9% for the month so far, slightly better than the S&amp;P 500.\n*****\n&gt; Experts have warned that there could an even bigger surge in virus cases, following the Thanksgiving holiday which could start to show up in the coming week. There have been more than 12.6 million cases in the U.S.\n*****\n&gt; # Jobs report\n&gt; There are some important economic reports in the week ahead, the most important being Friday\u2019s November employment report. There is is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMy thought here is the data is going to matter because if you listen to the Fed, and if you read through the Fed\u2019s minutes, they\u2019re in transition here. They\u2019re becoming more concerned about the rise in Covid cases, certainly about the lack of fiscal support,\u201d said Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists say another key report will be weekly jobless claims, which showed an increase in each of the last two weeks. \u201cThe employment data clearly has been weakening,\u201d said Faranello. If it continues, it will keep a lid on Treasury yields, which move opposite prices.\n*****\n&gt; Jefferies economist Tom Simons expects the elimination of Census Bureau workers to detract from the job gains in November, and he forecasts the economy added just 340,000 jobs.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt is hard to envision a particularly strong report coming out on Friday,\u201d noted Simons.\n*****\n&gt; Bank of America economists forecast just 150,000 payrolls were added for November, compared to 638,000 in October. The private sector is expected to add 300,000, but expected government layoffs impacted total payrolls in their forecast.\n*****\n&gt; Faranello said he expects the bond market to be much more active than normal this December because of the pending change in the White House, as well as the runoff election in Georgia Jan. 5 that will decide whether Republicans keep their Senate majority. The market has also been concerned about the lack of stimulus from Washington.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe theme in the market right now is definitely hope and optimism versus the on the ground dynamic with Covid,\u201d said Faranello. \u201cThe real question is can the vaccine rally hold up if we see the virus rise and we continue to see shutdowns. How does the market perform in light of that?\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said she expects the market to watch for vaccine news. \u201cThe question I think is now whether or not we see the emergency authorization given to Pfizer and followed by Moderna,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that is a catalyst to the market because that is when you will start to see the vaccine distributed.\u201d The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s vaccine advisory committee has a meeting set for Dec. 10 to discuss emergency authorization for the Pfizer\n*****\n&gt; Analysts expect investors to continue to gravitate to value and cyclicals, since they could have the biggest gains compared to already high priced big tech. But tech is still attractive.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe still see the Nasdaq leading,\u201d said Krosby. \u201cWhereas we enjoyed the vaccine related boom in the market, the fact is that investors and and traders are looking for big tech names to give them that growth in earnings and revenues.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ZTiIHZf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/kSw4HNb.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/oXE2aJo.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/30Iefrr.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/TEArZTK.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BzpCasV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2DhrB6V.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cRtEdkM.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ShSvr9G.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/e5ILGPd.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/e5ILGPd.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # December Almanac: Small Caps Have Shined\n\n&gt; December is now the number three S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials month since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% on each index. It\u2019s the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and third best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000 (1979). In 2018, DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of 2018 is not highly likely. When December is down it is usually a turning point in the market\u2014near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half of the month.\n\n&gt; In the last seventeen election years, December\u2019s ranking changed modestly to #2 DJIA, #5 NASDAQ, but S&amp;P 500 remains #3. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, have had a field day in election-year Decembers. Since 1980, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just once in ten election years in December. The average small cap gain in all ten years is a solid 3.0%. The Russell 2000\u2019s single loss was in 1980 when the Prime Rate was 21.5%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a451723116af31d8c7273c588c33b6c8/950092ad30c7af73-09/s400x600/360e0edef191c0c34d744f4a5ecd32fd8845da9d.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sector Weights Rising and Falling\n\n&gt; For most of the past year, one significant trend on a sector by sector basis has been the outperformance of sectors like Technology and Consumer Discretionary. The relative strength lines of these sectors have consistently shown outperformance versus the rest of the S&amp;P 500 as a whole, but since August, other sectors have begun to take the wheel. As we noted in today's Sector Snapshot, just about every sector has had a banner month in November with some of the biggest month to date rallies of the past 30 years, but some sectors have seen much larger returns than others. One of the best examples of this has been Energy which has risen over 35% in November. Similarly, Financials has risen an astounding 19.5% this month compared to more modest but still significant rallies of around 10% from Tech and Consumer Discretionary. Given those large degrees of outperformance, the relative strength lines of Energy and Financials have taken a sharp turn higher in recent weeks. Similarly, they have seen a turnaround in their weightings in the S&amp;P 500 as shown in the charts below.\n\n&gt; Over the past three months, the Financial sector has gained a full percentage point weighting while the Technology sector has lost 1.36 percentage points with a decline in weighting in three straight months. For Financials, that is the largest gain in weighting in a three month span since January 2017. For Tech, outside of the reshuffling in 2018 that saw a large share of its weight change into Communication Services, the last time the sector lost this much or more in weighting in three months was November of 2008. Prior to this recent string of losing weight over the past three months, Tech had seen weight gain in every month from October of last year through August. Even though the weight loss has been significant, it has only put a dent in the increased share of the entirety of the past year as the sector's weight is only back down to where it was in May.\n\n&gt; Similarly, looking at the other sectors, while Financials have added a full percentage point in share over the past few months, that follows nine months of declines running from last December through August. That brings the sector's weighting back above 10% in the S&amp;P 500, but that is only at the highest level since March. Similarly, Materials and Industrials have also seen their weights rise for three and four months in a row, respectively. As for Energy, the 0.44 percentage point gain in November is set to snap six straight months of declines; the longest such streak since at least 1990. As with Financials, that turn around this month has only put a dent in the longer term trend of weight loss as Energy's weighting is now only back to its highest level since July. Opposite of Energy, Consumer Discretionary is on pace to lose weight for the first time since March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/112720-Sector-Weights.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # A Month to Be Thankful For\n\n&gt; Heading into today with just three trading days left in November, the average Russell 1,000 stock was up 17.44% month to date. As shown below, not one of the five largest stocks is up even close to 17% on the month. For a market that had recently been driven higher in large part because of the five mega-cap Tech names, November has seen the mega-caps stall a bit while the rest of the market has seen broad participation. This is the type of breadth that market bulls have been waiting and hoping for.\n\n&gt; Of the 35 largest stocks in the Russell 1,000, Tesla (TSLA) is up the most so far this month with a gain of 43%. The other big winners include Chevron (CVX), JP Morgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Disney (DIS), and Comcast (CMCSA). Not one stock in the top 35 is down on the month, but the ones that are up the least are Netflix (NFLX), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Amazon (AMZN), and Home Depot (HD).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/largeststocks.png))**\n\n&gt; Looking at sectors, the average Energy stock in the Russell 1,000 is up 46% month-to-date but still down 27% year-to-date. Three other sectors have seen their stocks average MTD gains of more than 20%: Financials, Industrials, and Real Estate. Stocks in the Health Care and Utilities sectors are up the least on an average basis this month, but even these underperformers are still up more than 5%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/avgpctchg.png))**\n\n&gt; There are 37 stocks in the Russell 1,000 up more than 50% so far in November. Below is a list of this month's biggest winners. Coty (COTY) and Nordstrom (JWN) stand out the most with gains of more than 100%, followed by Spirit AeroSystems (SPR), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Diamondback Energy (FANG), and Empire State Realty (ESRT). The list of biggest winners this month is full of names that got hit hardest by COVID in areas like energy, travel, retail, and real estate. Notably, while these stocks are up an average of 68.5% in November, they're still down an average of 23% on the year. On a median basis, they're down even more year-to-date at -31.55%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/best-mtd.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Biden - Best Since Reagan\n\n&gt; The market started off November on a positive note, and even after the election has continued to add to its gains. Through the close today (11/24), the S&amp;P 500 is up 7.90% since the close on Election Day. Relative to every other Presidential election since the beginning of the S&amp;P back in 1928, the three-week performance of the S&amp;P 500 following this Election Day ranks as the second-best of all time. It came down right to the wire, but the only other US President to see a stronger market reaction to their election (or re-election) was Ronald Reagan in 1980 (7.97%). Behind Reagan and Biden, the only other Presidents where the S&amp;P 500 experienced an upside move of 5%+ in reaction to their elections were Hoover in 1928 and Clinton in 1996.\n\n&gt; On the downside, the most negative reaction of the market in the three weeks after Election Day was the 14.75% decline following President Obama's election in 2008. In addition to Obama, the S&amp;P 500's four other three-week downside moves of more than 5% came after the elections of Truman in 1948, the election of George W Bush in 2000 (although at the time it was unknown who was the winner of that election), the election of Franklin D Roosevelt in 1932, and Dwight D Eisenhower's re-election in 1956.\n\n&gt; In aggregate, the S&amp;P 500 hasn't historically responded all that great in the three weeks after a Presidential election. For every one since 1928, the median return of the S&amp;P 500 in the three weeks after Election Day has been a gain of just 0.35%. Breaking out returns by party, in the three weeks after a Democratic candidate is elected, the S&amp;P 500's median performance is a decline of 1.11% compared to a median gain of 3.04% when a Republican is elected.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/112420-President.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # DJIA 1,000 Point Thresholds\n\n&gt; What a wild year 2020 has been! With the DJIA closing above 30,000 today, it was the second first-time upside break of a 1,000 point threshold this year. While there have only been two new upside crosses of 1,000 point thresholds, due to the sharp pullback in March from the pandemic that briefly took the DJIA below 19,000 on a closing basis, there have actually been 12 different upside 1,000 point thresholds at some point in the year.\n\n&gt; The table below lists the first time that the DJIA closed above each 1,000 point threshold in its history along with the total number of times the index has crossed that level on a closing basis throughout history. The thousand point level that has seen the most crosses on a closing basis was 11,000 (87 crosses) while 10,000 ranks second at 67.\n\n&gt; Obviously, the higher the DJIA goes, the less impactful a move of 1,000 points becomes. At current levels, 1,000 points represents just 3.3%, which is really nothing more than a very bad day in the market. Given the diminishing impact of 1,000 points in the DJIA these days, their significance declines. Even still, the twelve new 1,000-point crosses since the 2016 election has given the President (who has publicly discussed the stock market more than any other President in history) plenty of ammunition to tweet about.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/112420-1000-Points-Threshold.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 30,000 Reasons To Be Thankful\n\n&gt; As 2020 winds down, it has been an extremely tough year on all of us. Still, there are many reasons to be thankful and today we will share some reasons investors should be thankful.\n\n&gt; Stocks have had one of the largest reversals ever in 2020, something to be thankful for. In fact, this could be the first year ever to see the S&amp;P 500 down more than 30% peak-to-trough and finish higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.25.20-Revised-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We should also be thankful that Congress was split in 2020, likely marking the 11th consecutive year the S&amp;P 500 gained under a split Congress. Gridlock is good they tell us and that very well could be true yet again.\n\n&gt; Want something else to be thankful for? We likely will have a split Congress for another two years after the two Georgia runoffs are official.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-2-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Let\u2019s be thankful that it is looking like stocks once again will be higher the year a President is up for re-election. In fact, you have to go back to FDR in the \u201840s the last time the S&amp;P 500 was lower for the year when a President was up for re-election.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-3-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Let\u2019s be thankful that the fastest bear market in history (only 16 days) is officially a thing of the past.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-4-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We are thankful that we are in a new bull market, which if history plays out once again, could have a lot of life left to it. In fact, the average bull market has lasted more than five years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-5-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cLet\u2019s be thankful that the huge move off the March lows was a major clue of more strength,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWe noted at the time (many different ways) that the enormous move we saw off the March lows likely suggested significantly higher prices, while many ignored the market signals and instead looked for a re-test for months on end.\u201d\n\n&gt; The 20-days off the March lows was the second best 20-day rally ever and sure enough, the returns have been very strong.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-6-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We are finally seeing many stocks participate in this bull market, another reason to be thankful. In fact, the Value Line Arithmetic Index recently made new all-time highs. This index is a great look at what the \u2018average\u2019 stock is doing and is a sign that this move isn\u2019t being led by just a few large cap tech stocks.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-7-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Let\u2019s be thankful that the NYSE Cumulative Advance/Decline line is at new highs. This looks at how many stocks are going up versus down and new highs are a sign of very healthy participation.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-8-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Emerging markets have started to turn higher and we are thankful that this group could be on the verge of a major breakout to new highs, clearing their peak from 2007. As we move into \u201921, this is one group we think could continue to do quite well for investors.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-9-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Global investors should be thankful, as the MSCI Global Index broke out to new highs as well, suggesting this rally isn\u2019t only about the US anymore.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-10-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We upgraded our view on small caps in September and the Russell 2000 Index is currently on pace to have its best monthly return ever. Investors should be thankful that this group is finally participating, as there are many more small caps than large caps, another sign of improving breadth, while small caps are also more domestic by nature and could be suggesting a strong US economy next year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-11-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Investors should be thankful for the incredible strength around the election, as the S&amp;P 500 gained more than 1% four consecutive days. This is extremely rare, yet, extremely bullish going out a year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-12-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; As we showed in Frothy Sentiment Rides Bullish Technicals, the huge number of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 making new monthly highs should make bulls quite thankful.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-13-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Earnings are expected to see a major bounce back, as the global economy gets back online next year, making many investors quite thankful.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-14-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Economic forecasts may not develop as predicted.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the final reason to be thankful?

        "selftext": "I'm a relatively new investor (22 M) who began buying individual stocks this March. While I still keep the majority of my investments in an S&amp;P 500 ETF and dollar-cost average into it every week, I wanted to see what people think about how I analyze my individual stock picks which in general I want to be more risky than my ETF. Some of the criteria I look at includes: \n\n1. Revenues/Earnings: I am usually more interested in if a company is growing revenues year-over-year versus earnings. The newer the company, the less I am worried about its EPS and P/E ratio. \n2. Market Cap: Do I see potential for the stock's value to continue raising or does it feel like the company is grossly overvalued relative to its revenues/earnings? \n3. Industry: I like to buy companies where I can see a growing/expanding industry or if there is a specific catalyst that will propel the stock forward over a certain time period (ex: oil stocks when Covid goes away).\n4. Analyst Ratings: In general I trust the consensus on the analyst's buy/hold/sell ratings and their price targets. My opinion is they probably know more about the stock as it is their job to evaluate companies. \n5. Volume: I usually don't like stocks with a super high volume because I feel like they are very volatile and a lot of the trading is from pump-and-dumpers or day traders. Exception is if it's a huge, well-established company that has had high volume for awhile. \n\nOverall I've earned more relative to the overall market since March and my current holdings include AMZN, BABA, SHOP, AVGO, DKNG, CRM, PTON, FANG, APHA. Does anyone see any flaws in my thinking or what are some main criteria that you look for? Thanks!",

        "selftext": "Salesforce Inc.  has thrived for years as a niche business-software vendor with a chief executive,  Marc Benioff , who has positioned himself as a prominent voice in American business.\n\nNow Mr. Benioff is taking steps that analysts say aim higher, intensifying the company's battle with the industry's biggest player:  Microsoft Corp. \n\nSalesforce is in advanced talks to acquire  Slack Technologies Inc. ,  The Wall Street Journal  reported Wednesday, in what would be Mr. Benioff's biggest acquisition to date and the company's most direct attack on a market  Microsoft  has identified as critical to its growth.\n\nThe deal, which could still fall through, would add fuel to Salesforce's ambition to become the go-to software platform for business customers to use for everything from data analysis to managing customer relationships to even daily communication.\n\nThe pandemic has amplified Salesforce's efforts. When Covid-19 broke out, Mr. Benioff quickly launched [w](https://Work.com)ork.com -- a suite of applications companies could use for contract tracing, mental-health checks and shift scheduling.\n\nA deal for Slack could heat up the simmering rivalry between Salesforce and  Microsoft . About five years ago  Microsoft  was in talks to buy Salesforce, but the deal fell apart over price. Salesforce lost out to  Microsoft  in 2016 in bidding for  LinkedIn Corp. , the business-focused social-media network. The loss stung. Salesforce responded by urging regulators to examine  Microsoft's  proposed purchase on antitrust grounds; the deal passed regulatory scrutiny.\n\nLanding Slack, which  Microsoft  once tried to acquire, could amount to a bit of revenge for Mr. Benioff.\n\nHaving failed to capture Slack,  Microsoft  launched its own workplace collaboration tool, called Teams, spurring a sometimes heated battle between the two companies.\n\n\"They want to kill us,\" Slack CEO  Stewart Butterfield  told the Journal earlier this year. This summer, Slack filed a complaint with the  European Union  over alleged antitrust behavior by  Microsoft  in using its dominance to push Teams.\n\nSlack \"extends the footprint of what Salesforce goes after,\" said Jefferies analyst  Brent Thill . \"Not everyone uses a sales system, but everyone can use collaboration. The beauty of Slack and Teams is that it touches everything inside enterprises.\"\n\nMr. Benioff has a history of deal making since he co-founded Salesforce 21 years ago and turned it into one of the most successful companies in the then still nascent market of providing software as a service. Salesforce completed its biggest-ever purchase last year, paying around  $15 billion  in stock for data-analytics platform  Tableau Software Inc. \n\nA year earlier it splashed out more than  $5 billion  for cloud-application provider MuleSoft. Inc. This year Salesforce said it was buying cloud-software provider  Vlocity Inc. \n\nMr. Benioff has long been one of  Silicon Valley's  highest-profile and most outspoken executives, using venues like the  World Economic Forum  in  Davos, Switzerland , to champion causes. He set up Salesforce with a pledge of corporate giving and bought himself an even larger platform with his acquisition of  Time Magazine  two years ago.\n\nThe  San Francisco -based company also has made a big push into the emerging field of artificial intelligence, developing tools to help customers make better use of their data. In 2016, it acquired PredictionIO, which makes software for building machine-learning apps. That followed the purchase of MinHash and Tempo AI, two further machine-learning companies. In 2014, it bought RelateIQ, which also specializes in the field.\n\nBreaking into the market of workplace collaboration has long been on Salesforce's agenda. In 2010, it launched Chatter, a private social network for companies to collaborate. And in 2016, it bought cloud-document collaboration app company  Quip Inc.  for more than  $500 million . Neither product attracted a wide following. Acquiring Slack, which Salesforce had previously explored buying, would immediately make the company a big player in the workplace- collaboration market. Slack has more than 130,000 paying customers.\n\nSalesforce, which declined to comment for this article, is pursuing Slack as competition in its core business of customer relationship management software is intensifying.  Adobe Inc.  this month said it would buy Workfront, a platform for marketers, for  $1.5 billion .  Microsoft  also has been pushing its rival product, called Dynamics. Salesforce still has the largest share with 20.1% of the world-wide market in 2019 compared with 2.6% for Microsoft Dynamics, according to research firm  Gartner Inc. \n\nEven with Slack, Salesforce would be a comparatively small rival to  Microsoft . The  Redmond, Wash. , company had sales of  $143 billion  in its latest financial year, generated by business enterprise software, its cloud-computing infrastructure, and consumer-facing businesses, such as videogaming, which has exploded during the pandemic. Its sales are roughly nine times Salesforce's annual revenue.  Microsoft's  market valuation tops  $1.6 trillion , about six times that of Slack and Salesforce combined.\n\nLast year Salesforce said it was seeking to reach  $28 billion  in annual sales in the 2023 financial year. It had  $16 billion  in sales in its most recent financial year.\n\n\"He really needs to keep growing,\" said  Mark Moerdler , senior research analyst at  Bernstein Research , of Mr. Benioff. \"He needs another big acquisition. Slack gives him a big acquisition. It gives him revenue.\"\n\nSlack also has been looking to broaden its appeal. Companies have used Slack principally for intra-office communications. In June, the software provider introduced Slack Connect, which allows messages to be sent between different companies. Slack's Mr. Butterfield said the feature has driven a rise in paying customers and should fuel future growth.\n\nBut big acquisition plans aren't without pitfalls. When Salesforce tried to buy social-media company  Twitter Inc.  in 2016, Mr. Benioff faced significant pushback from investors and he walked away from the deal. Although Slack is more in the mainstream of Salesforce's business than Twitter, it would still come at a hefty price given Slack's  $17 billion  market value before Wednesday's stock surge.\n\n\"Investors don't want Salesforce to do a big deal,\" Mr. Thill of Jefferies said, adding they want the company to show it can generate growth from within.",

        "selftext": "Reasons why:\n\n1. Walmart recently revealed their new service \u201cWalmart plus\u201d which is like Amazon prime except with same day delivery instead of 2 day delivery. This is something east for Walmart to implement since they have stores around the nation that can deliver products to customers from the store to your home in the same day. It is impossible for companies like Amazon to do this because of their lack of physical stores.\n\n2. Since Walmart has a strong online store and will sell tons and tons of stuff online and in store around the Christmas season, it is a very low risk stock. The recent PS5 and Xbox Series having a lot of stock on Walmarts web store lately has gained them a lot of sales and led to a lot of new exposure to their online store driving up Salesforce other products. \n\n3. For all you speculative trader out there: A huge investing firm BlackRock recently bought $8,000,000 in Walmart Call Options. That is a massive amount of options especially for a firm that usually buys stocks not options. If you don\u2019t trust advice let $8mil speak for me.\n\n4.Walmart is a huge part of the retail store market which goes up with vaccine news. This means that if they\u2019re is new news about a vaccine Walmart will go up. \n\n5. Walmart is currently in a good position to buy, it is up a small amount over the past month, week, and day it never goes red for very long. The stock is resistant to the volatility of the rest of the market and people are starting to notice that and put their money in\n\n6.

I'm a bull on NOW and think they offer an amazing platform, it's top-notch. \n\nI think NOW should acquire and integrate slack deeply into their platform and package the whole thing as one bundled platform, or just keep selling Slack on the side. Either way, I think this would win over many customers to the NOW platform. I think it would convert a lot of free Slack users into paying customers.\n\n\nI've worked at a few different medium-sized to large size businesses in the IT department, and NOW is the best platform I've ever used. The companies I was working for were investing heavily in it, full-time engineers and everything. Almost all processes and workflows getting put into NOW. The other thing our companies invested in, Slack. There any many projects being worked on to integrate the two platforms together.\n\n The possibilities are incredible.

        "selftext": "**What happened last week in the stock market? What are the next interesting earnings reports? Let\u2019s talk about the stock market!**\n\nHey everyone and Welcome so let\u2019s start with the recap of what has happened in the stock market since Monday.\n\nMonday the [DOW](https://ibb.co/ryHzJ3C) rose by more than 1,12% with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/PG8CcgX) also gaining more than half a percent while the [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/Qfwj6QX) was the laggard barely up 0,2% to finish the day while The [VIX](https://ibb.co/SdCNtBZ) had another big drop closing at 22.2. About 70% of the companies were gaining while 80% were trading over 50 and 200-day moving averages. The stock market was lead by the energy sector, which saw a major spike of almost 5% with Financials and Industrials also up more than 1% for the day. The rally was pushed mostly by small and mid-cap value stocks while large-cap growth companies were lagging as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/Kbvv08B) with the biggest company in the world, Apple, dragging down the sector, down almost 3% for the day. [CHART](https://ibb.co/LSxy7Mj) / [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/ZHYXxRW) / [CHART](https://ibb.co/pynTjjH)\n\nReports also came in on Monday that the PS5 and the new xBox have been sold out the moment they are available in stock, as the two gaming consoles are enjoying great demand, this bolds well for the parent companies Sony and Microsoft especially if they can keep up with the demand for this holiday season including Black Friday, holiday [RETAIL SALES](https://ibb.co/J2vDV3F) are forecasted to rise between 3,6 and 5,2%. [XBOX &amp; PS5 NEWS](https://ibb.co/qFMvRz5)\n\nAll this while Europe will start to re-open again after a contraction of the economy due to the latest lockdowns. As they saw the Eurozone PMI falling by almost 4% in October. [EUROZONE NEWS](https://ibb.co/8DFqbd7)\n\nSome good news came from [STORE CAPITAL](https://ibb.co/rHy6pGj) as the rent collections for November remained at 90% with no new tenants requiring deferrals, this suggests that companies are managing to survive even with the current restrictions in place.\n\nWe also saw reports that Janet Yellen will be the next Treasury pick as she would become the first person to be at the top of the FED the White House Council of Economic Advisers and the Treasury and she will become the first woman to lead the Treasury. [TREASURY NEWS](https://ibb.co/bRyZk8G)\n\nMoving on, Tuesday we saw the [DOW](https://ibb.co/K0SW54V) spike more than 1,5%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/8j7WcXs) rising 1,6% and the [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/S7D4MJ3) up more than 1,3% in what was a very good day for the stock market with more than 70% of companies advancing and 167 new highs on above average volume. The leaders were once again Energy and Financials, as this 2 sectors, will be two of the fastest benefiting from the end of the pandemic. The rally was continued with value companies leading the way for the 2nd straight day. You can struggle to find red spots in the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/FgNk2rg)  from Tuesday but there were a few in healthcare and real estate. This was the first time that the [DOW](https://ibb.co/C7dYJVD) closed over 30k. [CHART](https://ibb.co/FHmJRYw) / [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/C2WXYW6) / [CHART](https://ibb.co/S5DbTNV)\n\n[NIKOLA](https://ibb.co/M15WTJ4) stock tumbled after the recent rally as the GM deal seems less likely every day, as the deadline for the deal is December 3rd.\n\nWhile October [HOME SEARCHES](https://ibb.co/8PVX9KT) surged over 200% as a Redfin report shows, this leads me to believe that the strong housing demand will keep remaining at this levels for a good period of time. \n\nOn Wednesday we saw the stock market take a breather, as the [DOW](https://ibb.co/0f0Xt8g) lost 0,6%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/LYdGYSz) lost 0,16% while the pandemic plays regained some momentum with the [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/37Y7qGX) being up almost half a percent before the stock market closed for Thanksgiving.\n\nAbout 54% of companies were losing ground with below average volume for the day, as Technology and consumer discretionary and staples were the gainers for the day. Value plays did see some normal corrections after the huge gains in the last days as investors were cashing out some money probably before the day off. [CHART](https://ibb.co/pW4g7g4) / [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/ZJxg1MW) / [CHART](https://ibb.co/zhGhJMB)\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/PDyDqBb) from Wednesday as only a couple of companies Like Amazon, Apple, Nvidia and Shopify were gaining, while the energy sector was the biggest laggard.\n\nAlso the AAII investor sentiment [SURVEY](https://ibb.co/CM9RsDQ) from Wednesday showed that people are getting more bearish or bullish as the neutral feeling fell way below the historical average as bullishness remains very high. This is usually a contrarian indicator, as more bullishness gives me reason to take profits and bearishness to invest in the stock market, though I don\u2019t have the same confidence in this as in the past, as I expect this market rally to last until the end of next year.\n\nNews came in from Delta Airlines as pilots approved pay cuts and lower guaranteed hours that could avoid more than 1700 pilots getting cut off. This are great news both for the company and the pilots, as air travel will pick up again in the next years. [DELTA NEWS](https://ibb.co/PmHQMDf)\n\nAlso, Deere reported blowout [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/z4C2L6S) and a beat of more than 1$ per share and a revenue only 0,6% below last year while also issuing strong 2021 forecasts as they see the equipment sales climbing more than 10% compared to 2020 with a strong net income guidance of 3,6 to 4 billion $ compared to the May guidance of 1,6 to 2 billion $. [4Q 2020](https://ibb.co/FKNjHKs) / [2021](https://ibb.co/PT8GhBW)\n\nWe closed the week on a short day on Friday as the [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/8PXVwTT) led the way up 0,93%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/6Pgyrd9) up 0,24% and the [DOW](https://ibb.co/82j8ft0) barely up 0,13%. As we saw about 55% of the companies advancing on way below average volume due to the short day of trading with 85% of companies trading below average volumes. Friday was a pretty divided day as Health Care and Tech lead the way while Utilities and Energy saw a slight pullback after the big gains this week. [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/s3n9Sdb) / [CHART](https://ibb.co/Ldx38vW) / \n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/TggK0j5) from Friday as we see that the market was dragged higher by the big tech companies and communication services while the rest of the market was pretty much lagging.\n\nSo for the week, the Nasdaq lead the way up 3% and closed at the 45th record of 2020, the SP followed up 2,3% and closed a 26th record of the year with the DOW also rising 2% in this shortened week. While the [VIX](https://ibb.co/n6M1Z9k) closed the week just below 21, at the lowest level since February.\n\nSo great signs for the recovery of the economy still popped up almost every day, as the stock market is more forward looking than it is a reflection of the current economic conditions. As November will likely be the 7th straight month of job gains, though they will be the fewest in number since the recovery of jobs has begun. [NOVEMBER JOBS](https://ibb.co/ZVMDxtr)\n\nAlso, Bitcoin has seen its price drop from almost all-time highs at 19,5k down more than 3k before bouncing back to around 17k. The cryptocurrency was due for a correction as it had seen a huge rally in since Labor Day and this correction came as news popped of the Treasury attempting to rush out regulation on crypto-wallets. This would be a big negative factor for people who own Bitcoin not for just it\u2019s value but for using it also. But we will have to wait and see as the Treasury boss will be replaced when the Presidency changes. [BITCOIN NEWS](https://ibb.co/FhpVSjC) / [BITCOIN CHART](https://ibb.co/myVqJzN)\n\nSome company news from Friday were that [PALANTIR](https://ibb.co/hDMN8vz) saw it\u2019s stock plunge from all time high of 33,5$ to 27,6$ after Citron tweeted that they are shorting the stock with a 20$ price target. This are common tactics that short sellers use in my opinion to get the fast results they expected. Citron also got into a short position on NIO recently and that news also made the stock take a plunged but that has since recovered and even made new all time highs since.\n\nGreat news came for sports betting companies like DraftKings and Penn national as Canada seems to be going the same way as the US as legalizing sports betting advances more and more. [CANADA NEWS](https://ibb.co/6F20V4W)\n\nAlso, Tesla has seen a huge spike in the last weeks since the SP500 news, and the stock might see another spike as Musk [TWEETED](https://ibb.co/qyLQXRp) that the full self-driving feature will be released wider in the next weeks as the company finally approaches the end of software development as they collect more and more data. Tesla has surpassed Berkshire and is now the 6th largest company in the US as the stock is up more than 600% year to date making Elon Musk the second richest person in the world behind only Bezos. The company will go into the SP500 index at about 80% of its total market value cap as the index only counts the free-floating shares. I believe we won\u2019t see such a big spike in price when the company will be added to the SP in December, just like it happened with the stock split its more of a buy the news sell the event type of thing. As I expected the stock jumped over the previous all time highs and it might see a little correction when the event actually happens, but in the long run this a company that I will continue to own in my portfolio. [TESLA CHART](https://ibb.co/S3w4YVD) / [MUSK WEALTH](https://ibb.co/b6xRMZL) / \n\nNext week we will have some interesting earnings reports that I expect to beat the estimates from companies like [NEXT WEEK EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/6yNcM9m)\n\n[AUTOHOME](https://ibb.co/nQ08V04) which is a company that has great potential as it trades at a low P/E, they offer leads and services for auto consumers in China and they have a very wide consumer base to spread to.\n\nWith [ZOOM](https://ibb.co/br3pPJC) also expecting to report on Monday after the close, I recently just sold out of my position in Zoom. I think there is too much positive expectations for the company as it trade at almost 200 times earnings per shares.\n\nAlso, [Salesforce](https://ibb.co/D5dwYYW) are expected to announce earnings on Tuesday, as the company saw it\u2019s stock tumble after the news of a possible acquiring of Slack. In the long run that will be a very good play for the company as they have continued to buy more and more companies that allows them to keep growing.\n\nOther companies that are reporting and are very interesting to watch are [CrowdStrike](https://ibb.co/X3YBpqN) and [OKTA](https://ibb.co/rGLJtPW) also on Tuesday with [DocuSign](https://ibb.co/vvmSw3p) , [Dollar General](https://ibb.co/23YQzcg), [Marvell](https://ibb.co/nfbYcgG) and Snowflake reporting on Wednesday.\n\nGood news came this Saturday for online retailers as sales jumped more than 20% on Black Friday and are expected to grow between 15 and 35% tomorrow as Cyber Monday may set a new record for online sales.  [RETAIL EXPECTATIONS](https://ibb.co/QFbmcPD)\n\nHere are the most important economic data that we are looking for in the next week as it will be a week full of numbers that may impact how the stock market reacts in the near future. Hopefully we will see an improvement in PMI and a decrease in jobless claims and many more improvments. [NEXT WEEK ECONOMIC DATA](https://ibb.co/DYp3LyP)\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 30th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks on track to close out month of big gains as jobs data looms  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/27/stocks-on-track-to-close-out-month-of-big-gains-next-week-as-jobs-data-looms.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks next week will come off one of their best months ever into a busy week of economic data and the ongoing tensions between the spreading virus and positive news on vaccines and treatments.\n*****\n&gt; Another highlight of the week is expected to be Tuesday\u2019s testimony from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin before the Senate Banking Committee. They will be discussing the emergency measures taken to help the economy after the outbreak of the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow was up nearly 13% for November so far, and if it holds its gains into Monday\u2019s close, it will chalk up its best month since January, 1987. The S&amp;P 500 closed at a record 3,638 and was up 11.3% for the month. The gain is its best performance since April\u2019s 12.7%, which was the third best month for the S&amp;P 500 since its origin in 1957.\n*****\n&gt; November was a big month also for market rotation, with investors favoring stocks that would benefit from a rebounding economy and showing less love for long-held favorites among big tech and internet names. Financials were up more than 17% in the past month, and industrials rose nearly 15%, as investors bet vaccines would help the economy return to normal next year.\n*****\n&gt; Tech notched a single digit gain for the month so far and lagged the broader market. But some strategists expect big tech and internet names, stay-at-home stocks, to fare better in December.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe death of big tech has been announced over and over again, and we see that the market doesn\u2019t abandon them, but in fact migrates to big tech whenever there are concerns,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \u201cThe post-pandemic question is whether big tech can co-exist with the small and mid-cap.\u201d Small caps were one of the biggest winners in November, with the Russell 2000, up 20.6%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe did not see major selling in Nasdaq,\u201d as investors put funds in cyclicals and value, she said. Nasdaq was up 11.9% for the month so far, slightly better than the S&amp;P 500.\n*****\n&gt; Experts have warned that there could an even bigger surge in virus cases, following the Thanksgiving holiday which could start to show up in the coming week. There have been more than 12.6 million cases in the U.S.\n*****\n&gt; # Jobs report\n&gt; There are some important economic reports in the week ahead, the most important being Friday\u2019s November employment report. There is is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMy thought here is the data is going to matter because if you listen to the Fed, and if you read through the Fed\u2019s minutes, they\u2019re in transition here. They\u2019re becoming more concerned about the rise in Covid cases, certainly about the lack of fiscal support,\u201d said Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists say another key report will be weekly jobless claims, which showed an increase in each of the last two weeks. \u201cThe employment data clearly has been weakening,\u201d said Faranello. If it continues, it will keep a lid on Treasury yields, which move opposite prices.\n*****\n&gt; Jefferies economist Tom Simons expects the elimination of Census Bureau workers to detract from the job gains in November, and he forecasts the economy added just 340,000 jobs.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt is hard to envision a particularly strong report coming out on Friday,\u201d noted Simons.\n*****\n&gt; Bank of America economists forecast just 150,000 payrolls were added for November, compared to 638,000 in October. The private sector is expected to add 300,000, but expected government layoffs impacted total payrolls in their forecast.\n*****\n&gt; Faranello said he expects the bond market to be much more active than normal this December because of the pending change in the White House, as well as the runoff election in Georgia Jan. 5 that will decide whether Republicans keep their Senate majority. The market has also been concerned about the lack of stimulus from Washington.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe theme in the market right now is definitely hope and optimism versus the on the ground dynamic with Covid,\u201d said Faranello. \u201cThe real question is can the vaccine rally hold up if we see the virus rise and we continue to see shutdowns. How does the market perform in light of that?\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said she expects the market to watch for vaccine news. \u201cThe question I think is now whether or not we see the emergency authorization given to Pfizer and followed by Moderna,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that is a catalyst to the market because that is when you will start to see the vaccine distributed.\u201d The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s vaccine advisory committee has a meeting set for Dec. 10 to discuss emergency authorization for the Pfizer\n*****\n&gt; Analysts expect investors to continue to gravitate to value and cyclicals, since they could have the biggest gains compared to already high priced big tech. But tech is still attractive.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe still see the Nasdaq leading,\u201d said Krosby. \u201cWhereas we enjoyed the vaccine related boom in the market, the fact is that investors and and traders are looking for big tech names to give them that growth in earnings and revenues.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ZTiIHZf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/kSw4HNb.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/oXE2aJo.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/30Iefrr.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/TEArZTK.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BzpCasV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2DhrB6V.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cRtEdkM.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ShSvr9G.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/e5ILGPd.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/e5ILGPd.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # December Almanac: Small Caps Have Shined\n\n&gt; December is now the number three S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials month since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% on each index. It\u2019s the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and third best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000 (1979). In 2018, DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of 2018 is not highly likely. When December is down it is usually a turning point in the market\u2014near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half of the month.\n\n&gt; In the last seventeen election years, December\u2019s ranking changed modestly to #2 DJIA, #5 NASDAQ, but S&amp;P 500 remains #3. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, have had a field day in election-year Decembers. Since 1980, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just once in ten election years in December. The average small cap gain in all ten years is a solid 3.0%. The Russell 2000\u2019s single loss was in 1980 when the Prime Rate was 21.5%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a451723116af31d8c7273c588c33b6c8/950092ad30c7af73-09/s400x600/360e0edef191c0c34d744f4a5ecd32fd8845da9d.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sector Weights Rising and Falling\n\n&gt; For most of the past year, one significant trend on a sector by sector basis has been the outperformance of sectors like Technology and Consumer Discretionary. The relative strength lines of these sectors have consistently shown outperformance versus the rest of the S&amp;P 500 as a whole, but since August, other sectors have begun to take the wheel. As we noted in today's Sector Snapshot, just about every sector has had a banner month in November with some of the biggest month to date rallies of the past 30 years, but some sectors have seen much larger returns than others. One of the best examples of this has been Energy which has risen over 35% in November. Similarly, Financials has risen an astounding 19.5% this month compared to more modest but still significant rallies of around 10% from Tech and Consumer Discretionary. Given those large degrees of outperformance, the relative strength lines of Energy and Financials have taken a sharp turn higher in recent weeks. Similarly, they have seen a turnaround in their weightings in the S&amp;P 500 as shown in the charts below.\n\n&gt; Over the past three months, the Financial sector has gained a full percentage point weighting while the Technology sector has lost 1.36 percentage points with a decline in weighting in three straight months. For Financials, that is the largest gain in weighting in a three month span since January 2017. For Tech, outside of the reshuffling in 2018 that saw a large share of its weight change into Communication Services, the last time the sector lost this much or more in weighting in three months was November of 2008. Prior to this recent string of losing weight over the past three months, Tech had seen weight gain in every month from October of last year through August. Even though the weight loss has been significant, it has only put a dent in the increased share of the entirety of the past year as the sector's weight is only back down to where it was in May.\n\n&gt; Similarly, looking at the other sectors, while Financials have added a full percentage point in share over the past few months, that follows nine months of declines running from last December through August. That brings the sector's weighting back above 10% in the S&amp;P 500, but that is only at the highest level since March. Similarly, Materials and Industrials have also seen their weights rise for three and four months in a row, respectively. As for Energy, the 0.44 percentage point gain in November is set to snap six straight months of declines; the longest such streak since at least 1990. As with Financials, that turn around this month has only put a dent in the longer term trend of weight loss as Energy's weighting is now only back to its highest level since July. Opposite of Energy, Consumer Discretionary is on pace to lose weight for the first time since March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/112720-Sector-Weights.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # A Month to Be Thankful For\n\n&gt; Heading into today with just three trading days left in November, the average Russell 1,000 stock was up 17.44% month to date. As shown below, not one of the five largest stocks is up even close to 17% on the month. For a market that had recently been driven higher in large part because of the five mega-cap Tech names, November has seen the mega-caps stall a bit while the rest of the market has seen broad participation. This is the type of breadth that market bulls have been waiting and hoping for.\n\n&gt; Of the 35 largest stocks in the Russell 1,000, Tesla (TSLA) is up the most so far this month with a gain of 43%. The other big winners include Chevron (CVX), JP Morgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Disney (DIS), and Comcast (CMCSA). Not one stock in the top 35 is down on the month, but the ones that are up the least are Netflix (NFLX), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Amazon (AMZN), and Home Depot (HD).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/largeststocks.png))**\n\n&gt; Looking at sectors, the average Energy stock in the Russell 1,000 is up 46% month-to-date but still down 27% year-to-date. Three other sectors have seen their stocks average MTD gains of more than 20%: Financials, Industrials, and Real Estate. Stocks in the Health Care and Utilities sectors are up the least on an average basis this month, but even these underperformers are still up more than 5%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/avgpctchg.png))**\n\n&gt; There are 37 stocks in the Russell 1,000 up more than 50% so far in November. Below is a list of this month's biggest winners. Coty (COTY) and Nordstrom (JWN) stand out the most with gains of more than 100%, followed by Spirit AeroSystems (SPR), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Diamondback Energy (FANG), and Empire State Realty (ESRT). The list of biggest winners this month is full of names that got hit hardest by COVID in areas like energy, travel, retail, and real estate. Notably, while these stocks are up an average of 68.5% in November, they're still down an average of 23% on the year. On a median basis, they're down even more year-to-date at -31.55%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/best-mtd.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Biden - Best Since Reagan\n\n&gt; The market started off November on a positive note, and even after the election has continued to add to its gains. Through the close today (11/24), the S&amp;P 500 is up 7.90% since the close on Election Day. Relative to every other Presidential election since the beginning of the S&amp;P back in 1928, the three-week performance of the S&amp;P 500 following this Election Day ranks as the second-best of all time. It came down right to the wire, but the only other US President to see a stronger market reaction to their election (or re-election) was Ronald Reagan in 1980 (7.97%). Behind Reagan and Biden, the only other Presidents where the S&amp;P 500 experienced an upside move of 5%+ in reaction to their elections were Hoover in 1928 and Clinton in 1996.\n\n&gt; On the downside, the most negative reaction of the market in the three weeks after Election Day was the 14.75% decline following President Obama's election in 2008. In addition to Obama, the S&amp;P 500's four other three-week downside moves of more than 5% came after the elections of Truman in 1948, the election of George W Bush in 2000 (although at the time it was unknown who was the winner of that election), the election of Franklin D Roosevelt in 1932, and Dwight D Eisenhower's re-election in 1956.\n\n&gt; In aggregate, the S&amp;P 500 hasn't historically responded all that great in the three weeks after a Presidential election. For every one since 1928, the median return of the S&amp;P 500 in the three weeks after Election Day has been a gain of just 0.35%. Breaking out returns by party, in the three weeks after a Democratic candidate is elected, the S&amp;P 500's median performance is a decline of 1.11% compared to a median gain of 3.04% when a Republican is elected.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/112420-President.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # DJIA 1,000 Point Thresholds\n\n&gt; What a wild year 2020 has been! With the DJIA closing above 30,000 today, it was the second first-time upside break of a 1,000 point threshold this year. While there have only been two new upside crosses of 1,000 point thresholds, due to the sharp pullback in March from the pandemic that briefly took the DJIA below 19,000 on a closing basis, there have actually been 12 different upside 1,000 point thresholds at some point in the year.\n\n&gt; The table below lists the first time that the DJIA closed above each 1,000 point threshold in its history along with the total number of times the index has crossed that level on a closing basis throughout history. The thousand point level that has seen the most crosses on a closing basis was 11,000 (87 crosses) while 10,000 ranks second at 67.\n\n&gt; Obviously, the higher the DJIA goes, the less impactful a move of 1,000 points becomes. At current levels, 1,000 points represents just 3.3%, which is really nothing more than a very bad day in the market. Given the diminishing impact of 1,000 points in the DJIA these days, their significance declines. Even still, the twelve new 1,000-point crosses since the 2016 election has given the President (who has publicly discussed the stock market more than any other President in history) plenty of ammunition to tweet about.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/112420-1000-Points-Threshold.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 30,000 Reasons To Be Thankful\n\n&gt; As 2020 winds down, it has been an extremely tough year on all of us. Still, there are many reasons to be thankful and today we will share some reasons investors should be thankful.\n\n&gt; Stocks have had one of the largest reversals ever in 2020, something to be thankful for. In fact, this could be the first year ever to see the S&amp;P 500 down more than 30% peak-to-trough and finish higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.25.20-Revised-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We should also be thankful that Congress was split in 2020, likely marking the 11th consecutive year the S&amp;P 500 gained under a split Congress. Gridlock is good they tell us and that very well could be true yet again.\n\n&gt; Want something else to be thankful for?

        "selftext": "Buy Walmart At market Open\n\nReasons why:\n\n1. Walmart recently revealed their new service \u201cWalmart plus\u201d which is like Amazon prime except with same day delivery instead of 2 day delivery. This is something east for Walmart to implement since they have stores around the nation that can deliver products to customers from the store to your home in the same day. It is impossible for companies like Amazon to do this because of their lack of physical stores.\n\n2. Since Walmart has a strong online store and will sell tons and tons of stuff online and in store around the Christmas season, it is a very low risk stock. The recent PS5 and Xbox Series having a lot of stock on Walmarts web store lately has gained them a lot of sales and led to a lot of new exposure to their online store driving up Salesforce other products. \n\n3. For all you speculative trader out there: A huge investing firm BlackRock recently bought $8,000,000 in Walmart Call Options. That is a massive amount of options especially for a firm that usually buys stocks not options. If you don\u2019t trust advice let $8mil speak for me.\n\n4.Walmart is a huge part of the retail store market which goes up with vaccine news. This means that if they\u2019re is new news about a vaccine Walmart will go up. \n\n5. Walmart is currently in a good position to buy, it is up a small amount over the past month, week, and day it never goes red for very long. The stock is resistant to the volatility of the rest of the market and people are starting to notice that and put their money in. Based on TA\u2019s It is going to hit ATH tommorow and without a proper ceiling in place, it should rally pretty well.\n\n6. Below is a video that goes in depth into why we need to buy Walmart\n\n[Video Outlining Walmart Buy](https://youtu.be/SMnO-rw-0UM)\n\nDon\u2019t just take my word for it, do your own research, but I\u2019m pretty sure about this one.",

        "selftext": "Despite what many analysts term to be an economic crisis, IPO activity has been buzzing in the US stock market. Since 2019, IPO activity has been on the increase, rising on the heels of a stable and advancing global stock market activity. However, it appears that the pandemic did little to dampen the risk appetite of investors and businesses likewise.\n\nQ3 2020 saw a spike in the number of companies going public, with 165 companies listed on US stock exchanges. This is a continuum in the spike of public listings that have been on the rise since summer. Prior to June this year, companies which were going public never exceeded 40 in number. However, for four consecutive months since then, monthly IPOs have well exceeded that boundary.\n\nThis surge in IPO activity contrasts historical trends in election years, which tend to be concentrated in the first half of the year, away from the uncertainty of elections. In the months of August and September, we had a total of a 110 Initial Public Offers.\n\nHealth care companies, perhaps bolstered by rising demand for health care during the pandemic, accounted for most public offerings (41%) in the quarter. In terms of value, technology companies led the way, raising $16.4b, a figure which accounts for 50% of the total proceeds in Q3 2020. The financial sector had the largest volume of the biggest share of IPOs thanks to SPACs.\n\nDespite the United States\u2019 divisive stance on global trade which has pitted it against trader partners such as China and the EU, the country continues to remain a choice destination for investors. US stock markets attracted 22 cross-border IPOs in Q3 2020. 36% of these cross-border IPOs were from Chinese, which accounted for 78% of proceeds in that category.\n\nOne reason for the IPO drive is due to offerings from SPACs. As private companies increasingly opted to bypass the traditional IPO route for more innovative and cash-effective ways to bring their shares to public markets. SPACs have been an obvious and viable route to explore. Special Purpose Acquisition Companies accounted for 47% of public listings in the third quarter when they helped 77 companies go public. This is an increase of 185% from the second quarter, and surpasses last year\u2019s total of 57.\n\nSnowflake is credited to having the biggest IPO in the US stock market this year after it returned $3.9bn in proceeds. Other notable IPOs this year are Warner Media Group, Palantir, Royal Pharma PLC and Rocket Companies Inc. Investors await the public listing of Airbnb scheduled to take place in December, in what many analysts believe to be the icing on the cake for IPOs this year. The online rental company is seeking $30bn when its debut on Nasdaq.\n\nThe rise in IPOs may also be used as a parameter for growing risk appetite and by extension greed. Since march, the market has been in an upswing, though with some blips. Macroeconomic conditions such as low interest rates from the Fed, stimulus checks and the purchase of some asset class from the Fed has meant that money has found its way to the stock market.\n\nStocks such as Tesla, Amazon and Netflix have immensely benefit from the surge in trading activity in the market which has seen the market value of these companies increase significantly. Companies enticed with the liquidity in the market want to take a bite. On the other hand, investors are on the look out for the next Tesla or Apple and would readily snap up anything that as much as replicates the business model as seen from Salesforce and Snowflake.\n\nThis implies that a lot of caution is being thrown to the wind as investors may be mislead by the upward momentum in the broader market and grab any company that goes public without conducting due diligence. As such, this is a period where investors have to be particularly careful and double-check their fundamental and technical metrics before taking the plunge.",
