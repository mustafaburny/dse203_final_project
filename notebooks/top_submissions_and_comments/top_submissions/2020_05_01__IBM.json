        "selftext": "How many people really understand what they\u2019re buying, especially when it comes to highly specialized hardware companies? Most NVidia investors seem to be relying on a vague idea of how the company should thrive \u201cin the future\u201d, as their GPUs are ostensibly used for Artificial Intelligence, Cloud, holograms, etc. Having been shocked by how this company is represented in the media, I decided to lay out how this business works, doing my part to fight for reality. With what\u2019s been going on in markets, I don\u2019t like my chances but here goes:\n\nLet\u2019s start with\u2026\n\n**How does NVDA make money?**\n\nNVDA is in the business of semiconductor design. As a simplified image in your head, you can imagine this as designing very detailed and elaborate posters. Their engineers create circuit patterns for printing onto semiconductor wafers. NVDA then pays a semiconductor foundry (the printer \u2013 generally TSMC) to create chips with those patterns on them. \n\nSimply put, NVDA\u2019s profits represent the difference between the price at which they can sell those chips, less the cost of printing, and less the cost of paying their engineers to design them.\n\nNotably, after the foundry prints the chips, NVDA also has to pay (I say pay, but really it is more like \u201csell at a discount to\u201d) their \u201cadd-in board\u201d (AIB) partners to stick the chips onto printed circuit boards (what you might imagine as green things with a bunch of capacitors on them). That leads to the final form in which buyers experience the GPU.  \n\n**What is a GPU?**\n\nNVDA designs chips called GPUs (Graphical Processing Units). Initially, GPUs were used for the rapid processing and creation of images, but their use cases have expanded over time. You may be familiar with the CPU (Central Processing Unit). CPUs sit at the core of a computer system, doing most of the calculation, taking orders from the operating system (e.g. Windows, Linux), etc. AMD and Intel make CPUs. GPUs assist the CPU with certain tasks. You can think of the CPU as having a few giant very powerful engines. The GPU has a lot of small much less powerful engines. Sometimes you have to do a lot of really simple tasks that don\u2019t require powerful engines to complete. Here, the act of engaging the powerful engines is a waste of time, as you end up spending most of your time revving them up and revving them down. In that scenario, it helps the CPU to hand that task over to the GPU in order to \u201caccelerate\u201d the completion of the task. The GPU only revs up a small engine for each task, and is able to rev up all the small engines simultaneously to knock out a large number of these simple tasks at the same time. Remember the GPU has lots of engines. The GPU also has an edge in interfacing a lot with memory but let\u2019s not get too technical.\n\n**Who uses NVDA\u2019s GPUs?**\n\nThere are two main broad end markets for NVDA\u2019s GPUs \u2013 Gaming and Professional. Let\u2019s dig into each one:  \n\n**The Gaming Market:**\n\nA Bit of Ancient History (**Skip if impatient**)\n\nGPUs were first heavily used for gaming in arcades. They then made their way to consoles, and finally PCs. NVDA started out in the PC phase of GPU gaming usage. They weren\u2019t the first company in the space, but they made several good moves that ultimately led to a very strong market position. Firstly, they focused on selling into OEMs \u2013 guys like the equivalent of today\u2019s DELL/HP/Lenovo \u2013 , which allowed a small company to get access to a big market without having to create a lot of relationships. Secondly, they focused on the design aspect of the GPU, and relied on their Asian supply chain to print the chip, to package the chip and to install in on a printed circuit board \u2013 the Asian supply chain ended up being the best in semis. But the insight that really let NVDA dominate was noticing that some GPU manufacturers were focusing on keeping hardware-accelerated Transform and Lighting as a Professional GPU feature. As a start-up, with no professional GPU business to disrupt, NVidia decided their best ticket into the big leagues was blowing up the market by including this professional grade feature into their gaming product. It worked \u2013 and this was a real masterstroke \u2013 the visual and performance improvements were extraordinary. 3DFX, the initial leader in PC gaming GPUs, was vanquished, and importantly it happened when funding markets shut down with the tech bubble bursting and after 3DFX made some large ill-advised acquisitions. Consequently 3DFX, went from hero to zero, and NVDA bought them for a pittance out of bankruptcy, acquiring the best IP portfolio in the industry.\n\n**Some more Modern History**\n\nThis is what NVDA\u2019s pure gaming card revenue looks like over time \u2013 NVDA only really broke these out in 2005 (note by pure, this means ex-Tegra revenues):\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394577731223552/tumblr\\_Ikb8g9Cu9sxh2ERno \n\nSo what is the history here? Well, back in the late 90s when GPUs were first invented, they were **required** to play any 3D game. As discussed in the early history above, NVDA landed a hit product to start with early and got a strong burst of growth: revenues of 160M in 1998 went to 1900M in 2002. But then NVDA ran into strong competition from ATI (later purchased and currently owned by AMD). While NVDA\u2019s sales struggled to stay flat from 2002 to 2004, ATI\u2019s doubled from 1Bn to 2Bn. NVDA\u2019s next major win came in 2006, with the 8000 series. ATI was late with a competing product, and NVDA\u2019s sales skyrocketed \u2013 as can be seen in the graph above. With ATI being acquired by AMD they were unfocused for some time, and NVDA was able to keep their lead for an extended period. Sales slowed in 2008/2009 but that was due to the GFC \u2013 people don\u2019t buy expensive GPU hardware in recessions. \n\nAnd then we got to 2010 and the tide changed. Growth in desktop PCs ended. Here is a chart from Statista:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394674172919808/tumblr\\_OgCnNwTyqhMhAE9r9 \n\nThis resulted in two negative secular trends for Nvidia. Firstly, with the decline in popularity of desktop PCs, growth in gaming GPUs faded as well (below is a chart from Jon Peddie). Note that NVDA sells discrete GPUs, aka DT (Desktop) Discrete. Integrated GPUs are mainly made by Intel (these sit on the motherboard or with the CPU).\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394688079200256/tumblr\\_rTtKwOlHPIVUj8e7h \n\nYou can see from the chart above that discrete desktop GPU sales are fading faster than integrated GPU sales. This is the other secular trend [\\[TM1\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_msocom_1) hurting NVDA\u2019s gaming business. Integrated GPUs are getting better and better, taking over a wider range of tasks that were previously the domain of the discrete GPU. Surprisingly, the most popular eSports game of recent times \u2013 Fortnite \u2013 only requires Intel HD 4000 graphics \u2013 an Integrated GPU from 2012!\n\nSo at this point you might go back to NVDA\u2019s gaming sales, and ask the question: What happened in 2015? How is NVDA overcoming these secular trends?\n\nThe answer consists of a few parts.Firstly, AMD dropped the ball in 2015. As you can see in this chart, sourced from 3DCenter, AMD market share was halved in 2015, due to a particularly poor product line-up:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394753459994624/tumblr\\_J7vRw9y0QxMlfm6Xd \n\nFollowing this, NVDA came out with Pascal in 2016 \u2013 a very powerful offering in the mid to high end part of the GPU market. At the same time, AMD was focusing on rebuilding and had no compelling mid or high end offerings. AMD mainly focused on maintaining scale in the very low end. Following that came 2017 and 2018: AMD\u2019s offering was still very poor at the time, but cryptomining drove demand for GPUs to new levels, and AMD\u2019s GPUs were more compelling from a price-performance standpoint for crypto mining initially, perversely leading to AMD gaining share. NVDA quickly remedied that by improving their drivers to better mine crypto, regaining their relative positioning, and profiting in a big way from the crypto boom. Supply that was calibrated to meet gaming demand collided with cryptomining demand and Average Selling Prices of GPUs shot through the roof. Cryptominers bought top of the line GPUs aggressively.  \n\nA good way to see changes in crypto demand for GPUs is the mining profitability of Ethereum:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394769378443264/tumblr\\_cmBtR9gm8T2NI9jmQ \n\nThis leads us to where we are today. 2019 saw gaming revenues drop for NVDA. Where are they likely to head? \n\nThe secular trends of falling desktop sales along with falling discrete GPU sales have reasserted themselves[\\[TM2\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_msocom_2) , as per the Jon Peddie research above. Cryptomining profitability has collapsed. \n\nAMD has come out with a new architecture, NAVI, and the 5700XT \u2013 the first Iteration, competes effectively with NVDA in the mid-high end space on a price/performance basis. This is the first real competition from AMD since 2014.\n\nNVDA can see all these trends, and they tried to respond. Firstly, with volumes clearly declining, and likely with a glut of second-hand GPUs that can make their way to gamers over time from the crypto space, NVDA decided to pursue a price over volume strategy. They released their most expensive set of GPUs by far in the latest Turing series. They added a new feature, Ray Tracing, by leveraging the Tensor Cores they had created for Professional uses, hoping to use that as justification for higher prices (more on this in the section on Professional GPUs). Unfortunately for NVDA, gamers have responded quite poorly to Ray Tracing \u2013 it caused performance issues, had poor support, poor adoption, and the visual improvements in most cases are not particularly noticeable or relevant. \n\nThe last recession led to gaming revenues falling 30%, despite NVDA being in a very strong position at the time vis-\u00e0-vis AMD \u2013 this time around their position is quickly slipping and it appears that the recession is going to be bigger. Additionally, the shift away from discrete GPUs in gaming continues.\n\nTo make matters worse for NVDA, AMD won the slots in both the New Xbox and the New PlayStation, coming out later this year. The performance of just the AMD GPU in those consoles looks to be competitive with NVidia products that currently retail for more than the entire console is likely to cost. Consider that usually you have to pair that NVidia GPU with a bunch of other expensive hardware. The pricing and margin impact of this console cycle on NVDA is likely to be very substantially negative. \n\nIt would be prudent to assume a greater than 30% fall in gaming revenues from the very elevated 2019 levels, with likely secular decline to follow.\n\n**The Professional Market:**\n\nA Bit of Ancient History (again, skip if impatient)\n\nAs it turns out, graphical accelerators were first used in the Professional market, long before they were employed for Gaming purposes. The big leader in the space was a company called Silicon Graphics, who sold workstations with custom silicon optimised for graphical processing. Their sales were only $25Mn in 1985, but by 1997 they were doing 3.6Bn in revenue \u2013 truly exponential growth. Unfortunately for them, from that point on, discrete GPUs took over, and their highly engineered, customised workstations looked exorbitantly expensive in comparison. Sales sank to 500mn by 2006 and, with no profits in sight, they ended up filing for bankruptcy in 2009. Competition is harsh in the semiconductor industry.\n\nInitially, the Professional market centred on visualisation and design, but it has changed over time. There were a lot of players and lot of nuance, but I am going to focus on more recent times, as they are more relevant to NVidia. \n\n**Some More Modern History**\n\nNVDA\u2019s Professional business started after its gaming business, but we don\u2019t have revenue disclosures that show exactly when it became relevant. This is what we do have \u2013 going back to 2005:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394785029472256/tumblr\\_fEcYAzdstyh6tqIsI \n\nIn the beginning, Professional revenues were focused on the 3D visualisation end of the spectrum, with initial sales going into workstations that were edging out the customised builds made by Silicon Graphics. Fairly quickly, however, GPUs added more and more functionality and started to turn into general parallel data processors rather than being solely optimised towards graphical processing. \n\nAs this change took place, people in scientific computing noticed, and started using GPUs to accelerate scientific workloads that involve very parallel computation, such as matrix manipulation. This started at the workstation level, but by 2007 NVDA decided to make a new line-up of Tesla series cards specifically suited to scientific computing. The professional segment now have several points of focus:\n\n1. GPUs used in workstations for things such as CAD graphical processing (Quadro Line)\n\n2. GPUs used in workstations for computational workloads such as running engineering simulations (Quadro Line)\n\n3. GPUs used in workstations for machine learning applications (Quadro line.. but can use gaming cards as well for this)\n\n4. GPUs used by enterprise customers for high performance computing (such as modelling oil wells) (Tesla Line)\n\n5. GPUs used by enterprise customers for machine learning projects (Tesla Line)\n\n6. GPUs used by hyperscalers (mostly for machine learning projects) (Tesla Line)\n\nIn more recent times, given the expansion of the Tesla line, NVDA has broken up reporting into Professional Visualisation (Quadro Line) and Datacenter (Tesla Line). Here are the revenue splits since that reporting started:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394798232158208/tumblr\\_3AdufrCWUFwLgyQw2 \n\n\ud83d\udcf7 https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394810632601600/tumblr\\_2jmajktuc0T78Juw7 \n\nIt is worth stopping here and thinking about the huge increase in sales delivered by the Tesla line. The reason for this huge boom is the sudden increase in interest in numerical techniques for machine learning. Let\u2019s go on a brief detour here to understand what machine learning is, because a lot of people want to hype it but not many want to tell you what it actually is. I have the misfortune of being very familiar with the industry, which prevented me from buying into the hype. Oops \u2013 sometimes it really sucks being educated.\n\n**What is Machine Learning?**\n\nAt a very high level, machine learning is all about trying to get some sort of insight out of data. Most of the core techniques used in machine learning were developed a long time ago, in the 1950s and 1960s. The most common machine learning technique, which most people have heard of and may be vaguely familiar with, is called regression analysis. Regression analysis involves fitting a line through a bunch of datapoints. The most common type of regression analysis is called \u201cOrdinary Least Squares\u201d OLS regression, and that type of regression has a \u201cclosed form\u201d solution, which means that there is a very simple calculation you can do to fit an OLS regression line to data.\n\nAs it happens, fitting a line through points is not only easy to do, it also tends to be the main machine learning technique that people want to use, because it is very intuitive. You can make good sense of what the data is telling you and can understand the machine learning model you are using. Obviously, regression analysis doesn\u2019t require a GPU!\n\nHowever, there is another consideration in machine learning: if you want to use a regression model, you still need a human to select the data that you want to fit the line through. Also, sometimes the relationship doesn\u2019t look like a line, but rather it might look like a curve. In this case, you need a human to \u201ctransform\u201d the data before you fit a line through it in order to make the relationship linear.\n\nSo people had another idea here: what if instead of getting a person to select the right data to analyse, and the right model to apply, you could just get a computer to do that? Of course the problem with that is that computers are really stupid. They have no preconceived notion of what data to use or what relationship would make sense, so what they do is TRY EVERYTHING! And everything involves trying a hell of a lot of stuff. And trying a hell of a lot of stuff, most of which is useless garbage, involves a huge amount of computation. People tried this for a while through to the 1980s, decided it was useless, and dropped it\u2026 until recently. \n\nWhat changed? Well we have more data now, and we have a lot more computing power, so we figured lets have another go at it. As it happens, the premier technique for trying a hell of a lot of stuff (99.999% of which is garbage you throw away) is called \u201cDeep Learning\u201d. Deep learning is SUPER computationally intensive, and that computation happens to involve a lot of matrix multiplication. And guess what just happens to have been doing a lot of matrix multiplication? GPUs!\n\nHere is a chart that, for obvious reasons, lines up extremely well with the boom in Tesla GPU sales:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394825774989312/tumblr\\_IZ3ayFDB0CsGdYVHW \n\nNow we need to realise a few things here. Deep Learning is not some magic silver bullet. There are specific applications where it has proven very useful \u2013 primarily areas that have a very large number of very weak relationships between bits of data that sum up into strong relationships. An example of ones of those is Google Translate. On the other hand, in most analytical tasks, it is most useful to have an intuitive understanding of the data and to fit a simple and sensible model to it that is explainable. Deep learning models are not explainable in an intuitive manner. This is not only because they are complicated, but also because their scattershot technique of trying everything leaves a huge amount of garbage inside the model that cancels itself out when calculating the answer, but it is hard to see how it cancels itself out when stepping through it.\n\nGiven the quantum of hype on Deep learning and the space in general, many companies are using \u201cDeep Learning\u201d, \u201cMachine Learning\u201d and \u201cAI\u201d as marketing. Not many companies are actually generating significant amounts of tangible value from Deep Learning. \n\n**Back to the Competitive Picture**\n\n**For the Tesla Segment**\n\nSo NVDA happened to be in the right place at the right time to benefit from the Deep Learning hype. They happened to have a product ready to go and were able to charge a pretty penny for their product. But what happens as we proceed from here?\n\nFirstly, it looks like the hype from Deep Learning has crested, which is not great from a future demand perspective. Not only that, but we really went from people having no GPUs, to people having GPUs. The next phase is people upgrading their old GPUs. It is much harder to sell an upgrade than to make the first sale.\n\nNot only that, but GPUs are not the ideal manifestation of silicon for Deep Learning. NVDA themselves effectively admitted that with their latest iteration in the Datacentre, called Ampere. High Performance Computing, which was the initial use case for Tesla GPUs, was historically all about double precision floating point calculations (FP64). High precision calculations are required for simulations in aerospace/oil &amp; gas/automotive. \n\nNVDA basically sacrificed HPC and shifted further towards Deep Learning with Ampere[\\[TM3\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_msocom_3) , announced last Thursday. The FP64 performance of the A100 (the latest Ampere chip) increased a fairly pedestrian 24% from the V100, increasing from 7.8 to 9.7 TF. Not a surprise that NVDA lost El Capitan to AMD, given this shift away from a focus on HPC. Instead, NVDA jacked up their Tensor Cores (i.e. not the GPU cores) and focused very heavily on FP16 computation (a lot less precise than FP64). As it turns out, FP16 is precise enough for Deep Learning, and NVDA recognises that. The future industry standard is likely to be BFloat 16 \u2013 the format pioneered by Google, who lead in Deep Learning. Ampere now does 312 TF of BF16, which compares to the 420 TF of Google\u2019s TPU V3 \u2013 Google\u2019s Machine Learning specific processor. [\\[TM4\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_msocom_4) Not quite up to the 2018 board from Google, but getting better \u2013 if they cut out all of the Cuda cores and GPU functionality maybe they could get up to Google\u2019s spec. \n\nAnd indeed this is the problem for NVDA: when you make a GPU it has a large number of different use cases, and you provide a single product that meets all of these different use cases. That is a very hard thing to do, and explains why it has been difficult for competitors to muscle into the GPU space. On the other hand, when you are making a device that does one thing, such as deep learning, it is a much simpler thing to do. Google managed to do it with no GPU experience and is still ahead of NVDA. It is likely that Intel will be able to enter this space successfully, as they have widely signalled with the Xe. \n\nThere is of course the other large negative driver for Deep Learning, and that is the recession we are now in. Demand for GPU instances on Amazon has collapsed across the board, as evidenced by the fall in pricing. The below graph shows one example: this data is for renting out a single Tesla V100 GPU on AWS, which isthe typical thing to do in an early exploratory phase for a Deep Learning model:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618396177958944768/tumblr\\_Q86inWdeCwgeakUvh \n\nWith Deep Learning not delivering near-term tangible results, it is the first thing being cut. On their most recent conference call, [\\[TM5\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_msocom_5) IBM noted weakness in their cognitive division (AI), and noted weaker sales of their power servers, which is the line that houses Enterprise GPU servers at IBM. Facebook cancelled their AI residencies for this year, and Google pushed theirs out. Even if NVDA can put in a good quarter due to their new product rollout[\\[TM6\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_msocom_6)  (Ampere), the future is rapidly becoming a very stormy place.\n\n**For the Quadro segment**\n\nThe Quadro segment has been a cash cow for a long time, generating dependable sales and solid margins. AMD just decided to rock the boat a bit. Sensing NVDA\u2019s focus on Deep Learning, AMD seems to be focusing on HPC \u2013 the Radeon VII announced recently with a price point of $1899 takes aim at NVDAs most expensive Quadro, the GV100, priced at $8999. It does 6.5 TFLOPS of FP64 Double precision, whereas the GV100 does 7.4 \u2013 talk about shaking up a quiet segment. \n\n**Pulling things together**\n\nLet\u2019s go back to what NVidia fundamentally does \u2013 paying their engineers to design chips, getting TSMC to print those chips, and getting board partners in Taiwan to turn them into the final product.\n\nWe have seen how a confluence of several pieces of extremely good fortune lined up to increase NVidia\u2019s sales and profits tremendously: first on the Gaming side, weak competition from AMD until 2014, coupled with a great product in form of Pascal in 2016, followed by a huge crypto driven boom in 2017 and 2018, and on the Professional side, a sudden and unexpected increase in interest in Deep Learning driving Tesla demand from 2017-2019 sky high.\n\nIt is worth noting what these transient factors have done to margins. When unexpected good things happen to a chip company, sales go up a lot, but there are no costs associated with those sales. Strong demand means that you can sell each chip for a higher price, but no additional design work is required, and you still pay the printer, TSMC, the same amount of money. Consequently NVDA\u2019s margins have gone up substantially: well above their 11.9% long term average to hit a peak of 33.2%, and more recently 26.5%:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618396192166100992/tumblr\\_RiWaD0RLscq4midoP \n\nThe question is, what would be a sensible margin going forward? Obviously 33% operating margin would attract a wall of competition and get competed away, which is why they can only be temporary. However, NVidia has shifted to having a greater proportion of its sales coming from non-OEM, and has a greater proportion of its sales coming from Professional rather than gaming. As such, maybe one can be generous and say NVDA can earn an 18% average operating margin over the next cycle. We can sense check these margins, using Intel. Intel has a long term average EBIT margin of about 25%. Intel happens to actually print the chips as well, so they collect a bigger fraction of the final product that they sell. NVDA, since it only does the design aspect, can\u2019t earn a higher EBIT margin than Intel on average over the long term.\n\nTesla sales have likely gone too far and will moderate from here \u2013 perhaps down to a still more than respectable $2bn per year. Gaming resumes the long-term slide in discrete GPUs, which will likely be replaced by integrated GPUs to a greater and greater extent over time. But let\u2019s be generous and say it maintains $3.5 Bn Per year for the add in board, and let\u2019s assume we keep getting $750mn odd of Nintendo Switch revenues(despite that product being past peak of cycle, with Nintendo themselves forecasting a sales decline). Let\u2019s assume AMD struggles to make progress in Quadro, despite undercutting NVDA on price by 75%, with continued revenues at $1200. Add on the other 1.2Bn of Automotive, OEM and IP (I am not even counting the fact that car sales have collapsed and Automotive is likely to be down big), and we would end up with revenues of $8.65 Bn, at an average operating margin of 20% through the cycle that would have $1.75Bn of operating earnings power, and if I say that the recent Mellanox acquisition manages to earn enough to pay for all the interest on NVDAs debt, and I assume a tax rate of 15% we would have around $1.5Bn in Net income. \n\nThis company currently has a market capitalisation of $209 Bn. It blows my mind that it trades on 139x what I consider to be fairly generous earnings \u2013 earnings that NVidia never even got close to seeing before the confluence of good luck hit them. But what really stuns me is the fact that investors are actually willing to extrapolate this chain of unlikely and positive events into the future.\n\nShockingly, Intel has a market cap of 245Bn, only 40Bn more than NVDA, but Intel\u2019s sales and profits are 7x higher. And while Intel is facing competition from AMD, it is much more likely to hold onto those sales and profits than NVDA is. These are absolutely stunning valuation disparities. \n\nIf I didn\u2019t see NVDA\u2019s price, and I started from first principles and tried to calculate a prudent price for the company I would have estimated a$1.5Bn normalised profit, maybe on a 20x multiple giving them the benefit of the doubt despite heading into a huge recession, and considering the fact that there is not much debt and the company is very well run. That would give you a market cap of $30Bn, and a share price of $49. And it is currently $339. Wow. Obviously I\u2019m short here!",

Our platform integrates with leading enterprise business applications, and is compatible with multiple application environments, operating systems and devices, ensuring that workers have access to their critical business content whenever and wherever they need it.\n\nAs a common theme, you'll continue to see this enterprise focus throughout, but it gets better.\n\n&gt;Our go-to-market strategy is focused on selling our cloud content management platform as a solution for the entire enterprise with the full set of Box capabilities, leveraging our product suite offerings, and driving high-value significant business outcomes for our customers . . .  We focus our efforts on larger enterprises, capitalizing on international growth, and utilizing our partner ecosystem, where most advantageous . . . We offer nearly 1,500 integrations with partners including Microsoft, IBM,\nSalesforce.com, Apple, Google, Slack, Adobe, Palo Alto Networks, Okta, Zoom and others, giving our users easy access to their content in Box without leaving these applications. \n\nSee some familiar names here? Those are the stocks that you've already missed the boat on. Beyond that, if you take a look at their site, you can look at some of the big names already using Box in their business: Morgan Stanley, GE, Intuit, AstraZeneca, etc. \n\nEven their CEO himself has been out trying to [tell everyone to hop on for the ride](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-24/box-ceo-aaron-levie-sees-cloud-growth-during-coronavirus), but hopefully the news coming out of the $DBX call was enough to convince you that it's viable. \n\nIf we get into their financials, you'll see strong revenue growth YoY from about $600M for the year ending 1/31/2019 to $700M on 1/31/2020. Although they have recorded a net loss each year, it's primarily driven by sales and marketing expense (45% revenue and declining YoY). When your product sells itself in this pandemic, that becomes a bit less of an issue. The balance sheet is a bit weak with limited cash and substantial A/R that may be problematic, but given the nature of their customer base and limited leverage, it shouldn't be as big of a concern.\n\nIn terms of revenue generation, I'll direct you to their [Enterprise License Agreement](https://cloud.app.box.com/s/xec0gl0gqcgverpn2rw0r4kkzqycdsme). These are 3 year agreements which include implementation and full integration into the Box platform. Over the past couple of months, even a few large organizations signing up for these are going to make it rain tendies, but I'd bet you see massive growth here. Because enterprise customers on broad platform integrations tend to be locked in for a while, it's going to lead to incredibly strong guidance.\n\n#Why now?\n\n$BOX reports earnings on 5/27, so for once you'll have the chance to get in *before* the big run up. As of now, premiums are still low and have plenty of room to run. The best part here is that because $BOX hates their accountants, their fiscal year ends on 1/31, so their quarterly earnings on 5/27 will include actual numbers through 4/30/20. Because of this, they'll have a good 2 months worth of pure COVID gains to showcase. Analysts are estimating about $0.05 EPS, but I'd bet on that being revised up and still beaten. The window may start to close as the market reacts to the $DBX earnings and detail from their conference call, but there's still time to get in tomorrow.\n\n#My Positions\n\n$BOX 6/19 17c\n\n$BOX 6/19 20c\n\nI entered started building the position earlier today and am already up about 20%, but I plan to hold over the next couple of weeks and use any dips as an opportunity to add more. As always, do your own research and mind your personal risk tolerance.",

        "selftext": "\n\nOkay guys. I will keep it simple. I wrote a post saying $TWLO will moon but got removed. \n\nDon\u2019t worry if you missed $TWLO. Buy call on $OKTA or $NET. The reason is very (extremely) simple: these types of companies are built for the rona situation. I kept hearing people saying $OKTA $TWLO $NET is at ATH. So what? Stocks only ONLY go up. \n\nLook at these companies\u2019 past earnings and think about what these companies are doing during the pandemic. You are restarted if you buy puts on them.\n \nHere is some article explaining why $OKTA is a good play. I hope you have the patience to read all of it because I want you guys to be fucking rich. The article is from seeking alpha but I find it really good. \n\n\u201c\u201d\u201d\nSummary\n\nOkta is a market leader in the much promising sector of identity services.\nThe company was already growing at full speed before the coronavirus pandemic, and it should benefit from accelerating adoption during this period.\nMajor economic and technological trends provide powerful tailwinds for the business in the years ahead.\nThe stock is not too cheap at all, but it is still fairly valued if management keeps executing well.\nI\nOkta (NASDAQ:OKTA) is a high-growth leader in identity services, an area with tremendously promising opportunities for growth. The business was already producing outstanding performance before the coronavirus pandemic appeared on the scenario, and a globally distributed workforce in times of shelter at home policies all over the world is driving accelerating adoption for identity services.\n\nOkta stock is not cheap at all at current prices, but the business is strong enough to grow into its valuation over the next several years.\n\nAn Outstanding Growth Business\nThe company provides identity solutions for the workforce and customers. Workforce identity is the largest and most established segment, and it guarantees that the right employees and contractors will get access to the right networks and data in due time. Customer identity is a relatively new growth area for the company, and Okta is focused on both identity security and providing a seamless experience to the end-user in this business.\n\nOkta is benefiting from major growth tailwinds based on multiple drivers.\n\nDue to the rapid growth of cloud and hybrid IT, identity has become increasingly complex as organizations move to the cloud.\nThe global trend toward digital transformation means that every company is now a technology company, and businesses of all kinds need help at implementing identity solutions that can meet their specific requirements.\nCybersecurity is a major concern nowadays. According to management, more than 70% of hacking-related breaches are caused by stolen credentials, and identity protection is of paramount importance.\nWhen considering the size of the total addressable market, the company believes that it could be as high as $55 billion. Okta is expected to make $771 million in revenue during the fiscal year 2021, so the company is barely scratching the surface in comparison to its long-term growth opportunities.\n\nFinancial performance has been truly outstanding in recent years, with revenue growth reaching 54% annually since 2017. Management comments during the company's investor day on April 1 confirmed that the business keeps firing on all cylinders based on recent data, and several research firms increased their price targets for Okta after the conference.\n\nMost high-growth companies in the sector are losing money due to aggressive reinvestment needs to support long-term growth. Okta, on the other hand, is already generating positive free cash flows, and management has ambitious targets over the middle term.\n\nOkta intends to deliver revenue growth rates in the range of 30% to 35% over the next five years and a free cash flow margin of 20-25% in fiscal 2024. These targets are not easy to achieve, but they are not unrealistic either when considering the company's track record and future opportunities.\n\nTotal revenue was last quarter reached $167.3 million, an increase of 45% year over year. Subscription revenue was $158.5 million, an increase of 46%. Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) reached $1.21 billion, growing by 66% year over year.\n\n\nLooking at the long-term trajectory of both customer count and retention rates, the numbers are more than healthy. Okta is consistently gaining new customers while also making more revenue per customer, with the net dollar retention rate in the neighborhood of 120% over the past several years.\n\n\nIt can be difficult for an outside investor who is not an industry expert to assess the technological strength of a company such as Okta. However, the fact that customers keep spending more money on the company's solution is clearly a positive reflection in this area.\n\nLooking at other sources of information, Gartner recognizes Okta as a market leader in its main market.\n\nThe company still has a long way to go until reaching its profitability targets, but Okta has been steadily and consistently making progress in terms of profitability over time, so the business is clearly moving in the right direction.\n\nOkta has a relatively short history as a public company, but it is worth noting that the company has exceeded revenue and earnings estimates in each quarter since going public. This is indicating that management tends to provide modest guidance and to overdeliver over time, which is encouraging in terms of assessing Okta's ability to meet its targets going forward.\n\n\nRisk and Reward\nOkta is a market leader in an area with plenty of opportunities for growth in the years ahead. The company is firing on all cylinders and generating positive free cash flow, and there is a good chance that revenue growth will continue being strong while profit margins expand in the next 5 years. Vigorous top-line growth, in combination with expanding profit margins, will provide a double boost to earnings and cash flows.\n\nCompetition is always an important risk factor to watch, especially from large players with deep pockets such as IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). These companies have a wide reach among large corporations all over the world, and they also have solid reputations for reliability.\n\nHowever, Okta is a specialized player with the first-mover advantage in top quality identity services, and it benefits from remarkably high customer switching costs. Companies that are relying on Okta for their identity services would be very reluctant to change to another provider due to the risks and difficulties that this transition would potentially carry.\n\nBesides, having a large customer base also means more usage data for Okta, and this data is enormously valuable when it comes to permanently improving the quality of the company's services. Considering the company's competitive strength and world-class technologies, it is not unreasonable to say that a big technology company such as Microsoft could be more interested in buying Okta than trying to compete aggressively in Okta's main areas of strength.\n\nThe biggest drawback is arguably valuation, since Okta is trading at a price to sales ratio above 30. The company is one of the most promising businesses in the industry, but this quality is also acknowledged by the market and incorporated into the stock price.\n\nOkta can grow into its valuation over time, and there is a good chance that the stock will deliver double-digit returns over the long term from current price levels. But, still, the stock is fairly priced as opposed to undervalued at around $150 per share.\n\n\nI am not against buying Okta at these prices, because the company has enough strength to outperform expectations in the future. After all, the best growth opportunities are seldom available at cheap valuations, and these kinds of companies can many times sustain rapid growth for longer periods than what the market is giving them credit for. The bar is set quite high for Okta, but the company does not lack the capability to overdeliver.\n\nHowever, it is a more conservative assumption to estimate that revenue growth will be around 30% per year in the next five years, which would mean that the stock is fairly valued right now.\n\nFor those looking to start building a position in Okta at current prices, it makes sense to start doing it slowly. Perhaps buying one-third of your intended position at these prices and waiting for a better entry price over the middle term with the other two-thirds of the position.\n\nOne thing looks quite clear, though, Okta is a high-quality growth stock, and any pullback down the road could represent a remarkably attractive buying opportunity.\n\u201c\u201d\u201d\n\nEdit: I got fucked up buying $NAT calls but $TWLO saved me. I currently have no position on $OKTA as the earning date is 05/28. I will update my position a week before the earning.",

        "selftext": "I am a web developer with cloud certifications in Google Cloud Platform and AWS. I have a long position in VMW.\n\n**TLDR: VMW June 19 150C**\n\nVMWare's earnings are May 28, which leaves some decent runway left to play the IV increase leading into earnings, but you don't want anything expiring too close to earnings, since theta will steal your premium. Expiring wwo weeks after earnings is usually a fine distance that protects gains, but you probably want to consider selling the day (or two) before earnings if we  had already run up to 150 quickly.\n\nSo, onto the actual DD. First, from a personal standpoint, as a cloud developer, there is no cloud without virtual machines, as they are an essential component to scalable architecture (and building your application to scale with user growth is basically the original point of cloud based technology). And without VMWare, the landscape of potential VM options significantly diminishes.\n\nIf the cloud is the gold mine, VMWare are selling the very best virtualized shovels. Shit, they can just spin up new shovels at a keystroke.\n\nVMWare is at the core of any sound cloud strategy, and Google has recently announced their fully-managed VMware Cloud Foundation stack on dedicated Google infrastructure:\n\n[https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-announces-new-integrated-first-party-offering-with-vmware/](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-announces-new-integrated-first-party-offering-with-vmware/)\n\nAlso, VMWare's relevance in the context of COVID-19, and partnerships with Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are highlighted in this recent Business Insider article, which is pay-to-read, so I've copied it here, since I'm no elitist:\n\n[https://www.businessinsider.com/vmwares-coo-the-indispensable-bridge-in-the-cloud-2020-5](https://www.businessinsider.com/vmwares-coo-the-indispensable-bridge-in-the-cloud-2020-5)\n\n&gt;VMware Chief Operating Officer Sanjay Poonen said the alliances it forged with cloud giants like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have transformed the company into an \"indispensable bridge.\" VMware's virtualization technology has become a critical tool in the cloud as businesses set up networks on multiple platforms and in their own data centers. \"If you look at the last two to three years, we're the only company where the six public-cloud-infrastructure leaders have all embraced VMware,\" Poonen told Business Insider. \"Nobody else has that position of being the indispensable bridge from the private cloud to the public cloud.\"\n&gt;\n&gt;The earnings reports from several tech giants \u2014 Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, and Google \u2014 are in, and they underscore a key trend: The cloud is hot.\n&gt;\n&gt;VMware Chief Operating Officer Sanjay Poonen, who has been keeping track of the reports, said he noted another common theme in these cloud giants' success.\n&gt;\n&gt;\"They've all embraced us,\" he told Business Insider last week. \"Some percentage of those companies' revenue growth will come from VMware helping customers.\"\n&gt;\n&gt;How did all the big cloud companies become VMware allies?\n&gt;\n&gt;The Dell Technologies subsidiary blazed the trail for virtualization, a technology that enables businesses to access disparate computer systems as one network. Virtualization has become even more critical in the cloud because it allows businesses to set up networks on web-based platforms and scale down \u2014 or even abandon \u2014 private data centers.\n&gt;\n&gt;A new trend called \"hybrid cloud,\" where businesses use multiple cloud platforms and in-house data centers, has made VMware even more popular, since its software makes it possible to manage data and applications across platforms. As a result, all the major cloud players (including China's Alibaba) have sought out an alliance with VMware.\n&gt;\n&gt;\"If you look at the last two to three years, we're the only company the six public-cloud-infrastructure leaders have all embraced,\" Poonen said. \"Nobody else has that position of being the indispensable bridge from the private cloud to the public cloud. We view Amazon, Azure, Google as our friends. We've worked really hard the last three years to build pristine partnerships with all of them.\"\n&gt;\n&gt;Some of VMware's friendships have even risen eyebrows. The most prominent example is Oracle: The two companies had long been rivals, with Oracle refusing to support VMware's software for years \u2014 until it announced an unexpected new alliance last year. VMware Chief Information Officer Bask Iyer told Business Insider at the time that he was \"very pleasantly surprised\" by Oracle's decision to form a partnership.\n&gt;\n&gt;The COVID-19 crisis has led to a faster acceleration of the cloud as businesses scramble to adapt to the sudden pivot to remote work. VMware is well-positioned to benefit because of the alliances it forged in the past few years, according to Poonen: \"The notion of VMware being at the center of the cloud for the enterprise is only going to get more and more pronounced,\" he said.\n\n**TLDR: VMW June 19 150C**\n\nSecure those virtualized tendies.",

They worked with a few grocery stores and eventually Walmart. Then Walmart said thanks, BYE!!!! So now for the last 2 years $ZEST has been suing Walmart. The only info I have on this company is my friend calling me up out of nowhere to talk about it, and everything I have read on the Yahoo Finance conversation section. Supposedly Walmart will settle soon or buy them out, because Walmart stole their tech, then handed it to IBM, so IBM could make it for them. If anybody else has any additional info about this company and the trial, please post it below, I think its getting closer because the Stock has jumped big time the last couple of days. I have bought 500 shares so far, but seriously considering buying more but I just don't have that much info on this. This thing could fly. What do y'all think?",

        "selftext": "Good afternoon fellow autists and retards,\n\nAs we are entering earnings season, many companies have started to release their Q1\u20192020 earnings and I believe the general consensus is that, they\u2019re going to suck, because you know, Covid-19 happened. But what about the rest of 2020?\n\n**Q2\u20192020, Q3\u20192020 earnings and possibly Q4\u20192020 earnings**\n\nHere\u2019s a few things I\u2019m expecting regarding Q2\u20192020 and Q3\u20192020\n\nI\u2019m expecting many balance sheets using aggressive accounting methods to be \u201ccleaned out\u201d. This means that companies will switch from using aggressive revenue recognition, having inflated assets value and deferring their expenses to subsequent periods to recognizing their revenue when the payment is received, recognizing their assets at historical cost, and expensing their charges when they occur. \n\nI believe they will use the Covid-19 pandemic as scapegoat to finally clean their balance sheet/income statements. But why now? Because earnings were going to suck anyways, might as well throw everything out right? You fucking bet. Expect a lot of non-cash charges (changes in accounting methods) and legacy costs which are costs incurred by a company in prior years under different leadership or when the entity's priorities and resources were different. Key words here: Different. Leadership. I believe newly appointed CEOs will the opportunity Covid-19 provides and throw everything out. They\u2019re going to clean the closet. Skeletons are coming out boys and gals.\n\nCEOs: \u201cWe were used to defer charges to next quarter? Yeah, let\u2019s not fucking do that anymore. Who cares, earnings were going to fucking suck anyways. Oh, and by the way, I\u2019m not the one to blame for this, it was past management\u2019s fault.\u201d\n\n**Q1\u20192021 earnings**\n\nSo we know both Q2\u20192020, Q3\u20192020 and possibly Q4\u20192020 are going to suck ass. But what about Q1\u20192021 earnings tho? The exact opposite; they\u2019re going to be gangbusters. Why? Because not only Y/Y they\u2019re being compared to Q1\u20192020 which were pretty much non-existent, but all those legacy costs and accounting changes will be accounted for/priced in. And the new CEOs will look like godsend individuals. And the hammered companies will bounce back.\n\nKnowing this, here\u2019s a list of newly appointed CEOs (2019 and 2020) :\n\n\u00b7 IBM (IBM)                               \u00b7 Disney (DIS)\n\n\u00b7 Rite Aid (RAD)                        \u00b7 Accenture (ACN)\n\n\u00b7 Fox Corportation (FOX)        \u00b7 Cognizant (CTSH)\n\n\u00b7 HSBC (HSBC)                          \u00b7 ViacomCBS (VIAB)\n\n\u00b7 SAP (SAP)\n\n**TLDR:** Worse than expected earnings for the rest of the year for companies with newly appointed CEOs, and gangbusters in 2021.",

        "selftext": "IBM has had basically flat (slight decline) revenues and profits for ~5 years, which is not quite the Tech stock headline we are used to seeing.  Market cap is 108bn today, revenues of 77bn in 2019, and earnings of 9.4bn. \n\nI feel they are integrated into so many business / government operations, that they will be reasonably well positioned during the covid crisis to continue to make money.  It is true that IBM will not be able to sell as many new services while its clients cost cut &amp; pause new investing. However IBM is a mature business - clients cannot easily switch products - and they will continue to earn from those.  \n\nThey are focused improving their hybrid cloud offerings and acquired redhat in July 2019 for 34bn, which at the time had growing earnings (3bn per year most recently), and growing revenues. Maybe IBM will screw up this trend, but hopefully not. Cloud provides some upside potential.\n\nI believe that even though we see some very slight declines in earnings/revenues, IBM is still massively profitable, and eventually will be able to regain their footing through investment in R&amp;D or acquisition.\n\nIBM's global technology services (consulting, build, design, run) has been declining (9%), which accounts for 60% of their revenue. However IBM is pretty well diversified in offerings, and will likely see other bets begin to offset this. Cloud is about 30% of their business and is growing at a 20% rate.\n\nIBM pays ~5.7Bn out in dividends of it's 9.7bn in earnings, so dividend is sustainable. I think for the price, IBM is a bargain.  It's not a trendy company, but it makes money and will continue to do so.\n\nThoughts and opposing opinions welcome",

My problem is that cloud computing is not just cloud computing, but there are many different service models (IaaS, PaaS and SaaS, and more). Besides, there are companies where cloud computing is only a business unit, among others (Microsoft; Amazon; Tencent; IBM) and other companies that mainly do cloud computing (Oracle; Shopify; Salesforce). \n\nThat is why I conducted a fundamental analysis ( [(click here if you want)](https://theeuropeanview.com/best-winner-stocks-for-cloud-computing/#more-2153) ) of the market and examined the individual players according to their multiples.

        "selftext": "Yesterday I  listened to this very interesting podcast ( We Study Billionaires - TIP295: Mohnish Pabrai on Value Investing &amp; Philanthropy) where Mohnish Pabrai mentions what he calls secret compounders. The concept sounds very interesting to me, the company that compounds earnings like Visa or Mastercard, but doesn't demand the premium yet, since market doesn't know it yet. He mentions his investment in Fiat - Chrysler (FCAU) where he thought that Ferrari (RACE) alone is worth the whole company due to this reason. I have been thinking about it since yesterday, but I couldn't think of any. I also tried to identify some requirements for such a company.\n\n1. Low P/E: goal is obviously to find the ones that haven't appreciated in value yet, since Mr. Market doesn't know about or doesn't value their compounding ability yet. So they have to have earnings and P/E multiple growth potential. If they have high P/E I can just buy V or MA, where I am sure of their copounding ability.\n2. Addresable market that they dominate and is also growing, enabling the future growth of the company.\n3. High operating and net margin that signal strong moat and ability to earn a lot of money which they then reinvest in the bussines.\n4. Scalability without increasing costs; costs percentage should be decreasing considerably with scale. Something like Saas is the best representation of this.\n5. Reinvested earnings are effective at raising revenue. If company is just investing a lot of money, but there is no growth, then they lack compounding ability imo (like IBM for example).\n\nThese are just a few points that I am not even sure that apply so I would like to get your opinion.\n\nWhat criteria should we use to figure our if the company is a secret compunder? And do you have any ideas which companies would that be and why?\n\nTo me, the closest I could think of is Cisco (CSCO). They generate huge cash flow, have great balance sheet and pay nice and sustainable dividend. However, this doesn't make them a compunder, but just a nice company to invest in. Their shift from legacy business to Saas could make them one, but only if they are successful in making it a larger part of their revenue. This would increase their earnings power and also make their revenue more predictable, warranting P/E multiple expansion.\n\nI appreciate any feedback :)",

This gives them diversity and allows them to have clientele even in a pandemic, most notably with their healthcare, public sector and banking solutions. As I'm writing this I believe that their assets make them somewhat undervalued at $14, and as they have earnings 05/28 there may be room for a run up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**VALUE**\n\nAccording to their website they maintain 100 million health records, provide services for 15,000 healthcare and life sciences professionals and have over 1 million users of their software and systems products. Primarily they appear to provide administration products to healthcare providers and use Microsoft cloud to implement some of their products. More importantly they aim to reduce time-to-market and accelerate drug development, one of the main challenges facing COViD-19 drug manufacturers. \n\nIn their public sector business, they provide a management service to companies for AWS, Azure, VMware, Oracle and Google cloud platforms to  \"enable companies to focus on their strategic priorities while shifting the burden and expense of building and managing an hybrid cloud infrastructure\". Their website also shows:\n\n \n\n* 800+ managed cloud customers\n* Experts in complex, enterprise-scale transformation\n* 20,000+ Microsoft professionals/Microsoft Certified Solution Provider\n* 1,000+ AWS professionals/AWS Premier Consulting Partner\n* Managed services for Azure, AWS, VMware, Oracle, Google &amp; more\n* Full-stack Platform as a Service for SAP\n\nIn terms of their banking subset, they operate in over 70 countries, have processed in excess of 80 million payment accounts and service 250 million mortgages. They also provide security and analytics using AI and automation, for example helping NatWest, a major RBS group UK bank, move to image-based cheque-clearing. \n\nThese are a few examples of some of their operating industries but if you want to see more visit the website, I'm not doing all the work for you. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Partners**\n\nThis is just a short section but they have over 200+ partners, showing potential for a wide customer base, a few are:\n\n* AT&amp;T (cloud services)\n* AWS\n* Google Cloud\n* Microsoft\n* HP\n* Dell\n* IBM\n\n**Financial Performance**\n\nNow this is where it gets a bit tricky. All credit to u/fuzzyblankeet and Co. but no matter how many times I've smashed my head into their financials I still struggle to understand them. I'm gonna need some help with this bit from you guys in the comments.\n\n \n\n|Fiscal Quarter|Date reported|EPS forecast|EPS actual|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Q4 2019|02/06/2020|1.08|1.25|\n|Q3 2019|11/11/2019|1.44|1.38|\n|Q2 2019|08/08/2019|1.71|1.74|\n|Q1 2019|05/23/2019|2.07|2.19|\n\n \\*^(According to Nasdaq.com)\n\nI don't know why EPS seems to decrease every quarter despite them having what I consider to be a strong business model, however I will link their financials [here](https://www.dxc.technology/investor_relations/ds/140309-dxc_financial_reports) if the more experienced among you want to give feedback.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI just wanted your opinion on whether this is a good trade for earnings next week as I'm looking for something to replace VTIQ as a money maker, I want them to go up more but need something less volatile. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: If you're coming to me for financial advice there's no hope.**\n\nAlso was looking at [Marvell Technology](https://www.marvell.com/) as they seem to be making moves in 5G and cloud computing, so feel free to feedback on that if you want to have a look.

        "selftext": "For all of you that spent today FOMOing into $DBX, listen up. Although they have recovered well from their COVID low, $BOX has plenty of room to run and this may finally be the chance for some of you to make a play better than just bending over for an IV crush. **TLDR: $BOX calls**\n\n#Overview\n\nEven amid all of the recent hype for $DBX, $BOX hasn't gotten the love that it deserves. Where $DBX spends most of their time making small money on the consumer front or on limited basic enterprise plans, $BOX focuses on playing with the big money (like the MMs that steal your weekly allowance). To give a bit of background, let's get into the background and then their latest 10-K.\n\n&gt;With our Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) cloud content management platform, users can collaborate on content both internally and with external parties, automate content-driven business processes, develop custom applications, and implement data\nprotection, security and compliance features to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, internal policies and industry standards and regulations . . .  Our platform enables a broad set of business use cases across enterprises, hundreds of file formats and media types, and user experiences. Our platform integrates with leading enterprise business applications, and is compatible with multiple application environments, operating systems and devices, ensuring that workers have access to their critical business content whenever and wherever they need it.\n\nAs a common theme, you'll continue to see this enterprise focus throughout, but it gets better.\n\n&gt;Our go-to-market strategy is focused on selling our cloud content management platform as a solution for the entire enterprise with the full set of Box capabilities, leveraging our product suite offerings, and driving high-value significant business outcomes for our customers . . .  We focus our efforts on larger enterprises, capitalizing on international growth, and utilizing our partner ecosystem, where most advantageous . . . We offer nearly 1,500 integrations with partners including Microsoft, IBM,\nSalesforce.com, Apple, Google, Slack, Adobe, Palo Alto Networks, Okta, Zoom and others, giving our users easy access to their content in Box without leaving these applications. \n\nSee some familiar names here? Those are the stocks that you've already missed the boat on. Beyond that, if you take a look at their site, you can look at some of the big names already using Box in their business: Morgan Stanley, GE, Intuit, AstraZeneca, etc. \n\nEven their CEO himself has been out trying to [tell everyone to hop on for the ride](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-24/box-ceo-aaron-levie-sees-cloud-growth-during-coronavirus), but hopefully the news coming out of the $DBX call was enough to convince you that it's viable. \n\nIf we get into their financials, you'll see strong revenue growth YoY from about $600M for the year ending 1/31/2019 to $700M on 1/31/2020. Although they have recorded a net loss each year, it's primarily driven by sales and marketing expense (45% revenue and declining YoY). When your product sells itself in this pandemic, that becomes a bit less of an issue. The balance sheet is a bit weak with limited cash and substantial A/R that may be problematic, but given the nature of their customer base and limited leverage, it shouldn't be as big of a concern.\n\nIn terms of revenue generation, I'll direct you to their [Enterprise License Agreement](https://cloud.app.box.com/s/xec0gl0gqcgverpn2rw0r4kkzqycdsme). These are 3 year agreements which include implementation and full integration into the Box platform. Over the past couple of months, even a few large organizations signing up for these are going to make it rain tendies, but I'd bet you see massive growth here. Because enterprise customers on broad platform integrations tend to be locked in for a while, it's going to lead to incredibly strong guidance.\n\n#Why now?\n\n$BOX reports earnings on 5/27, so for once you'll have the chance to get in *before* the big run up. As of now, premiums are still low and have plenty of room to run. The best part here is that because $BOX hates their accountants, their fiscal year ends on 1/31, so their quarterly earnings on 5/27 will include actual numbers through 4/30/20. Because of this, they'll have a good 2 months worth of pure COVID gains to showcase. Analysts are estimating about $0.05 EPS, but I'd bet on that being revised up and still beaten. The window may start to close as the market reacts to the $DBX earnings and detail from their conference call, but there's still time to get in tomorrow.\n\n#My Positions\n\n$BOX 6/19 17c\n\n$BOX 6/19 20c\n\nI entered started building the position earlier today and am already up about 20%, but I plan to hold over the next couple of weeks and use any dips as an opportunity to add more. As always, do your own research and mind your personal risk tolerance.",

        "selftext": "Regardless of how stoned out of his mind he probably was during this most recent twitter incident, you can't deny that Elon's tweets have an air of WSB-tier autism to them. The grandiose edginess, the kamikazi-esque yoloing, general lack of any impulse control, etc. Tbqh I've always had some sort of inherent dislike towards Elon that I couldn't explain... but he's grown on me, in a weird way. I don't know why, there's just something quaint about his autism. I think I must find it familiar, comforting.\n\nWhat do you think are the odds that Elon lurks in this sub? I doubt we could ever coax him out of hiding, but imagine the sheer unbridled retard influence he might have left upon our community, right under our noses. Like a little guardian angel. He might even be that weirdo who gilds everyones posts in the discussion thread at odd hours of the night. That seems on-brand.\n\nAnyway, Elon, I'm sorry that I said the only cool thing about you is that you're dating an alien. After some reflection, I've come to realize that I have some deep-seated jealousy to work through. Retardation is, in a way, an art, and not everyone can ascend to be one of the greats. Indeed, it takes someone special to post a video of themselves drinking their own piss in their parents basement because SPY opened green, or to yolo into tweets self-destructive enough to bring the entire market down with them. I feel like an imposter among these gods. But they give me something to strive for... and I feel a bit humbled just by the knowledge of their presence.",

        "selftext": "Okay you gang of deluded retards, I'm going to drop some actual useful DD for you. tl;dr and positions at the top, because I know that for the majority of you, \"Fedex parked in front of White House, buy calls\", is as sophisticated DD as your deformed cuckold brains can handle. This is a long post so for those of you who actually want to understand why you're taking a position and learn about a commodity, read on; for those of you who don't, fuck off.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**TL;DR AND POSITIONS**\n\nTankers will have their best earnings call in at least 5 years, if not the last decade, due to all-time-high tanker rates that began spiking towards mid-March. Rates are so high that, say, companies with clean LR2 tankers currently run a spot price of 8x the 5 year historical average and 1 single 2 month voyage is enough to be profitable on the entire year. You're looking to make bets on tanker companies that are trading below their NAV, will post strong FCF, were well positioned for the spike in prices, have large fleets, and have the right types of ships. $NAT is literally the meme-iest stock because it's actually the worst across every single one of these dimensions of any tanker company.\n\n**TL;DR ON WHY NAT IS A MEME:**\n\nLet me draw you an analogy:\n\nWSB is a class in school, and you've all decided not to be homosexual for a day, and NAT is a girl in class. As a result, you all start sending her dick pics and showering NAT with attention, assuming that she is extremely high value. However, in your autistic haste, you all forgot to look around and actually there are 15 other girls in the classroom, and they are all way hotter than NAT. NAT is actually ugly and fat, but you're too busy tunnel visioning in on NAT while you beat off to realize that literally every option is better. As a result, NAT is now overvalued, but a bunch of you are stubborn fuckfaces who continue to shower her with attention because you're too autistic to admit you had no fucking idea what you were doing this whole time.\n\n**POSITIONS:**\n\n**Lowest Risk Position Examples**\n\n* EuroNav ($EURN) $12.50C 6/15\n* Scorpio Tankers ($STNG) $23C 6/15\n\n**Moderate Risk Positions**\n\n* $EURN $12.50C 5/15\n* $STNG $25C 5/15\n\n**Higher Risk Positions**\n\n* $EURN $15C 5/15\n* $STNG $30C 5/15\n\n**Legendary Autistic Risk Positions**\n\n* $EURN $17.50C 5/15\n* $STNG $35C 5/15\n* $NAT, any calls\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**SECTION 1: Overview on Oil Demand Crisis**\n\nIf you understand oil demand destruction and contango, skip ahead. However, based on the fact that people continue to pile in on USO and UCO calls and leaps under the justification of \"hurr durr oil must go up, right, so cheap\", and half of you are bagholding $NAT still, I assume 75%+ of you are retarded.\n\nMany of you still probably have no idea what's happening with oil and why it's fucked long-term. The tl;dr here is that even with OPEC+'s historical cuts, we're still drastically oversupplied. The problem with oil is it's not your meme SPY calls that are in the cloud; oil is a physical product and when you trade USO, you're trading (theoretically) on receiving delivery of oil. We are almost completely out of oil storage already.\n\nYou may ask, well [u/safuros](https://www.reddit.com/u/safuros/), if that's true, why don't we turn off the wells? Markets naturally handle supply and demand. Well, you worthless piece of shit, while your child-groping Honors Econ teacher may have drawn a graph once upon a time in high school when you still had the potential not to be a useless person as you are now, oil production isn't that simple. The reason every country is sandbagging and trying to get other countries to cut oil is that there's a game theory element in play, as well as an oil well intrinsic function issue.\n\nOnce oil wells reduce their production to roughly 50-60% of output, they *cannot go any lower* without risking destroying the well, which is extraordinarily expensive to get the rights to drill on and also is like throwing out a gallon of water when you've only taken a sip. Thus, the only option to reduce further is to entirely stop production and cap the well, and then, assuming your lease on the well hasn't lapsed by the time you can re-open it, uncap it, both of which are extraordinarily expensive. Therefore, most oil companies are far, far better off continuing to produce oil at a loss, because that's still a long-term better play than turning off. Moreover, why the fuck should you be the well to turn off, if other's aren't? Add in the fact that everyone cheats on oil production cuts and the Saudis and Russians are trying to fuck each other and the US in the ass, and you've got a nice oil crisis.\n\nThis leads to the USO/UCO shit show and negative WTI price. Normally, futures holders offload their contracts to buyers who intend to actually take physical delivery as the option expiration date draws near. However, because there is no storage and no demand, none of the typical buyers actually wanted to buy, so you had a bunch of tendie seeking autists desperately trying to offload their contracts so that they wouldn't have 5 dumptrucks of oil barrels delivered to their homes and be completely fucked, such that they were willing to *pay* people (i.e. negative price) to take their contracts. As for contango, well, google it.\n\nFinally, this problem isn't going away any time soon because unless you're so truly deluded as to believe that we'll not only have a V shaped re-opening in terms of social, commercial, and consumer behavior, but that fuel consumption across airlines and cars will rebound immediately, we're on a long term path to recovery, and we're already out of supply. This is like having a clogged bathtub full of water and turning the faucet from 100% on to 50% on - you're still fucked until the faucet turns off (impossible) or the clog goes away more than enough to offset the faucet (not happening for a while). This is why experts broadly agree that [the OPEC+ cuts are meaningless](https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/4/21/opecplus-mega-deal-rendered-meaningless-by-demand-destruction) and that groups like Morgan Stanley believe [demand destruction of oil will persist until well into 2021](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Morgan-Stanley-Oil-Demand-Wont-Return-To-Normal-Until-End-2021.html).\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**SECTION 2: A brief overview of Tankers**\n\nYou don't need much of a brain to understand, given the above, why tankers stand to benefit from demand destruction. However, there are many types of tankers, and it's not as obvious as hurr durr buy tankers. Each tanker type carries a different type of product, has a different size, and commands a different rate. Here is the current rates:\n\n[3 key types of tanker business models, spread across a variety of tanker variants](https://preview.redd.it/hd3q2ncaqmw41.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fca616d8afc83afa14721af8e2e5bd1bf243fadd)\n\nAt this point I'm realizing that this post is getting way too long and i'm tired of typing it already, but do your own research on types of tankers. You can see though that tankers are commanding a stupidly high rate compared to their historical values:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q8u5q1odqmw41.jpg?width=1081&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bc3668993ed1965a45f8c9af5a7a07f16e851b5\n\nThe current rates are so high that [one spot voyage is profitable on the entire year](https://www.tradewindsnews.com/tankers/tanker-rates-one-spot-voyage-makes-the-whole-year-in-red-hot-market/2-1-801368).\n\n&gt;\"If an MR can get $30,000 per day on a spot voyage, it covers its costs for a year...If an LR2 gets $150,000 or $160,000 a day, it\u2019s the same...you could lay the ship up, earn zero for the next ten months, and still make a profit on the ship.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Guess who owns the most clean-fuel ready LR2's that are exposed to the spot price? $STNG](https://preview.redd.it/iyeeu45gqmw41.jpg?width=894&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b23175ca9c77eb406cadc5b01411c22545e72d59)\n\nNow, don't be stupid and assume that rates will hold this high all year. That said, even if rates went to $0 by mid summer, the rates for Q2 are so high such that it'd still be a higher revenue year than last year. And rates aren't going to $0...they're going to continue to stay above the historical average, just not as high as now, due to the crazy demand destruction.\n\n* **Miscellaneous point of clarification:** I see a lot of dumbasses posting about what numbers will look like if the entire fleet is booked out for, say, NAT. That's ridiculous and not how it works, so don't just go number of tankers x spot rate = revenue for year = tendies.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Section 3: Why $STNG and $EURN?**\n\nI really need to go fuck your wife soon, so I'm making the sections shorter and shorter. But i'll still tell you way $STNG and $EURN are good bets. First, let's start with NAV - **N**et **A**sset **V**alue. If you don't know what this means, Google it.\n\nAs you (should) know, NAV is something you estimate and can be calculated differently based on different assumptions. Trading below NAV means the stock is underpriced as is, and that's before record earnings and guidance. By most accounts, $EURNs NAV is at least $13 currently, and $STNG is close to $30. They trade at $10 and $21, respectively, right now.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$STNG isn't even at it's average price for 2019, but 2020 is objectively a better year unless a meteor blows up their fleet](https://preview.redd.it/smsydzfnqmw41.jpg?width=2001&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b4de32295c00a853844ad5de51c44e7aeabbe0c)\n\nSecondly, fleet size and type. $STNG has one of the largest fleets in the world, and in particular, they have the most LR2 tankers. If you go back up to the graph, you'll see that clean LR2 tankers are commanding an absurd rate, spiking to as high as $250,000 for a few days and currently settled around $150-175k/day, compared to a 5-year historical value of below $25k. $EURN has a solid fleet of VLCC's which are commanding a strong rate, and EURN has good financials - most their boats are fairly new, they don't have a ton of debt.\n\nLastly, they're among the first up on the earnings block, with STNG reporting 5/6 this week and EURN reporting on 5/7. Compare that to NAT, who reports the 23rd, so theta will eat away at what remains of your atrophied testicles every day. That said, regardless of theta, STNG and EURN are really strongly positioned.\n\nI expect that earnings will be solid and likely beat, but not by a crazy amount because rates only started really jacking up in late March, and rates in early Q1 were actually pretty low. However, as many of you still don't fucking understand, **earnings don't matter nearly as much as** **guidance.** That's why you dumbfucks all complain about companies beating earnings but still tanking and then creating stupid conspiracy theories about \"MM is fucking rigging this market\". Guidance for tankers is going to be **euphoric**.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Section 4: Why is $NAT a meme, and mistakes I see people making**\n\nUltimately, this comes down to people angling towards the right space (tankers) but you've been too stupid to do any research. You probably do this for all your bets, because you're a fucking autist, but you should stop.\n\n1. Fleet size misconception: Cramer meme'd NAT, infamously calling out that they have the largest fleet in the world. In fact, if you actually tried to verify anything you ever fucking did, you could have googled this and realized that NAT has a fleet that, just like your dick, is one of the smallest around. Moreover, they have the wrong type of boats - they primarily have Suezmax boats, which command an okay rate, but aren't close to the best boats to have right now.\n2. No investigation of NAV: NAT's NAV, by all accounts, is close to $3. They are trading at close to $6, and were nearing $8-9 at peak pump. Why the fuck on god's green earth would you buy a company with the wrong type of boats, the wrong fleet size, trading at over 2x NAV, when everyone else is around or below their NAV and has a better fleet?\n3. Massive debt and shitty assets: NAT is saddled in debt, is historically shittily managed (read their earnings report if you know how, but you probably don't know how), and all their boats are at the end of their lifetime, meaning NAT not only has horrible debt but will need to buy a shit ton of new boats very soon\n4. Stupid assumptions on revenue: We covered this earlier, but no, just because demand is high, it doesn't mean every boat is going to get booked at the spot price. Many boats are on existing contracted rates from last quarter, and the ones who are not are not all getting booked out at once.\n5. Looking at ATH as an indicator: If i see another one of you dumb fucks pointing out that NAT used to trade at $16 5 years ago, I will personally find you, tape you to a chair, and shit down your mouth. NAT has issued a shit ton more shares. You are probably the same group who thinks that USO went from $2 to $18 last week.\n\nThe ONLY justification for NAT is now that it's been memed and retail knows all about it, it will probably rise again if the other tankers do well. You can make that play, and you might even make money. Just make sure to dump that shit before earnings because they're not going to be good enough to justify the rise and there's going to be a stupid dump.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**MY POSITIONS:**\n\n\\- 40 $STNG 5/15 $23C\n\n\\- 200 $EURN 5/15 $12.5C\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\n\nFuck you",

        "selftext": "**TL;DR**: China needs dollars badly, not gay little treasuries yielding 1%. They will not purchase treasuries at the next auctions and interest rates will spike. Chaos in the bonds market will lead to chaos in the stock market. Bears,go in for the kill. Bulls, close your long positions on the 11th and reopen them at noon on the 13th. What makes this play so beautiful is just how well it can be timed. $TLT ATM put 5/15 purchased 5/11.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\\*\\*Automod didn't like the full post, I'm going to be editing this together in parts to figure out what word or phrase is triggering it, bare with me here\\*\\**\n\nThis post will start off with some ECON 101 shit for the autists who never learned the basics. If you already know why bond prices move in  the opposite direction as interest rates and why China buys so much US debt, then skip ahead. The bond market dwarfs the size of the stock market, there is about 9 times as much outstanding bond value as there is total market cap. Bonds are where the big boys play.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Interest rates and bond pricing\n\n**When interest rates rise, the prices of old bonds fall, and when interest rates fall, the prices of old bonds rise.**\n\nConsider a zero coupon bond, one where you pay a certain amount and at the end of the bond term you get paid back more (unless you\u2019re a cucked German bond buyer). For a one year bond with a 5% yield, you would pay$95.24 for the privilege of redeeming the bond for $100 in one year\\[Formula:(end value \u2013 price)/price = interest rate\\]. But what if the next day interest rates fall to 3%? The bond you just bought suddenly looks a lot more attractive. Its yielding a lot more than the bonds the suckas are buying today. If you turned around and sold it the next day, you could scalp off the extra yield and sell it as though it were 3% bond. Using the same formula, you could sell it for $97.04. Nice. If on the other hand, the interest rate rose to 7%then everyone trying to make a buck would want the bonds they buy to yield 7%. In order to sell your 5% bond, you would have to take a loss to make it attractive. The new price of the same bond would be $93.48.\n\n**The sensitivity of a bond\u2019s price to interest rates, depends on the bond\u2019s time to maturation.**\n\nThe more years a bond has to collect interest, the more the rates affect the bond\u2019s price. Consider a bond that pays 5% a year, compounded annually. In practice, only savings bonds compound, but any bond can be recalculated as if they compound. That bond would cost $231.38 and pay out$1000 at maturation \\[Formula: end value = price \\* interest rate \\^ years\\]. If the next day, interest rates increased to 7%, U R FUK. That bond would now sell for a paltry $131.37. If interest rates fell to 3%, your investment would nearly double to $411.99. If they fell to 1% you could sell that bond for$741.93. Damn WSBGod. That\u2019s the power of compound interest. Below in the DD section, there\u2019s a more realistic graph showing approximately how $TLT will respond to interest rate movements.\n\n**Interest rates depend upon supply and demand for a bond.**\n\nThe fundamental rule of microeconomics: prices are set by supply and demand. Therefore, the discount and interest payments of a bond depend crucially on what market participants want, their *demand*.  Suppose you know a company, Widgettech, that sells widgets is run by a  complete moron and that Widgettech is trying to raise capital by selling bonds. There\u2019s another company WidgetDotCom, run competently, that currently sells their zero coupon bonds with a 3% discount. Would you buy Widgettech bonds at 3%? Hell no. You need to receive a premium for that. The same is true for government bonds: th eUS 10 year is trading at 0.6% interest while the Brazilian 10 year is trading at 8% interest. Investors need to be compensated for the risk that Brazil can\u2019t pay them back. Demand for crappy bonds is low. Demand for good bonds is high\n\n*Supply* is another fundamental issue. If you want $100 to YOLO, you could probably get a loan from your dad. If you want to YOLO $10 million you\u2019re going to need to look elsewhere. The larger the loan you want, the more market participants you\u2019re going to need to engage. To get that  $10 million you\u2019re probably going to need to put your tin cup before a bunch of banks and all your friends and family. To make them pay any attention to you, you\u2019re going to need to make them a damn good offer. It can\u2019t be the \u201cI\u2019ll pay you back next week\u201d that you might do with your dad. It would have to be \u201cI\u2019ll pay you back an additional 50%.\u201d When a company or nation wants to take on substantially more debt, they will need to raise the interest rate to get more people to drop some change in the tin cup they\u2019re rattling.",

At this point in time, it has climbed to a record high and it is used to gauge whether the stock market is overvalued or undervalued.\n\nExamples, it surged to 118% before the dot-com bubble burst in 2000 a, and topped 100% before the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nIt now sits at 179%, question is, can we rely on this measure?

        "selftext": "During one of the coronavirus task force briefings, an admiral came up and detailed how he was getting ventilators into the system. Much of the press was outraged when he detailed it out because the government was using a middle man that was profiting off it. The admiral\u2019s response? \u201cMy job is not to invent a system. My job is to put volume in the system.\u201d\n\nSuch is the realities of leadership in a time of crisis.\n\nSo. When the Fed went into \u2018save everything mode,\u2019 they did so with a desire to unfreeze credit markets and make sure markets functioned. Powell\u2019s job was to put volume into the system.\n\nThat system now has volume. And plenty of it. Everyone is buying everyone else\u2019s debt. Disney wants five billion for a year? Wells Fargo says \u2018COUNT ME IN.\u2019 Boeing is issuing bonds? \u2018IT\u2019S A RAID,\u2019 says every person with access to debt markets. Delta can\u2019t fly 10% capacity this quarter. People buy their debt like it\u2019s the liftoff of the 747.\n\nSo the system now has ample volume going back and forth. Everyone\u2019s leveraged to the tits in new debt. What could possibly go wrong?\n\n30-50 million unemployed is what\u2019s wrong.\n\nAlready high household debt continues to skyrocket as new income falls off a cliff is what\u2019s wrong.\n\nReckless debt issuance and a borrowing system that never really reset after 2008-9 is what\u2019s wrong.\n\nIn what will likely go down as the dumbest FOMO among smart money of all time, every major institution has tried its best to get in on every company\u2019s debt offerings. But what happens if Delta sees just 30% of flying traffic in the third quarter? What if California and France refuse to open Disney\u2019s parks until early July and shut them down again in September as precaution? And would anyone really be surprised if Boeing doesn\u2019t get the 737 max off the ground until 2021?\n\nThese events have a decent probability of happening. And such companies as Delta and Boeing may not be able to service their debt at the end of 2020 if, say, we have to shut everything back down to prevent a second wave.\n\nNot every bond holder is going to get screwed. But the rate of defaults on loans is going to be much higher than the laughable estimates JPM and Well\u2019s have set cash aside for.\n\nLet\u2019s keep in mind: it wasn\u2019t the Fed\u2019s job to invent a new system. Its job was to keep the current system functioning.\n\nSo what is the system they\u2019re pumping? The debt system. And all they\u2019ve really done is re-inflate a debt bubble to a much bigger size than it was in February. And given the details released today by the Fed essentially announcing they'll be buying HYG and LQD, this bubble is growing to hindenburg-sized levels.\n\nWith people putting their rent on credit cards, our system is just surviving right now. But what happens in wave two?\n\nBoeing can\u2019t pay its coupon as Delta withdraws all orders so it can attempt to service debt too big to pay itself. An empire like Disney looks at risk for shuttering. Restaurants are seen as germ lands by the average consumer and nobody goes dining in for several years. Housing construction companies simply cannot survive the epic demand and supply destruction with defaults on mortgages skyrocketing as well. Fannie and Freddie make 2008 look like a prelude to the real story. And the Fed may have to try and get out of HYG as companies in the ETF fail and they have to preserve tax payer dollars as per their legal obligation, which will only further feed the negative feedback loop.\n\nAt Buffet\u2019s shareholder meeting saturday, he praised Powell\u2019s speed to get credit markets functioning again. On top of that, he said March was the highest bond issuance month of all time, followed by April breaking that record.\n\nBut here\u2019s what\u2019s interesting in what he said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the consequences of this will be.\u201d\n\nSo perhaps we are somehow able to punt the debt bubble pop down the road by allowing all loans to defer for extended periods. Perhaps the US government is able to find some way to write off certain types of debt in a last resort effort to avoid economic catastrophe. They will certainly get creative as everyone becomes desperate. But in all likelihood, these kinds of ideas are untenable without resulting in extreme damage to other segments of the economy.\n\nWe are on the brink of the debt bubble collapse. And given a second wave, we will create a negative feedback loop that will slump the United States Markets for years.\n\nI don't believe we will have a 10 year great depression. We learned so much from that time period and we will use that knowledge to recover faster, and maybe even better. But like the civil war, world war one, and world war two: everyone thought at the beginning of each outbreak it was only going to last a few months. We think the same thing now about this crisis.\n\nTL;DR: Often when you are operating in a paradigm you don\u2019t realize the flaw of that paradigm until you are forced to shift into a new paradigm. The debt bubble paradigm is about to shift, but not before it pops.",

        "selftext": "TLDR: we're all sheep heading to the slaughter.\n\nWhat do you remember about March 23rd, 2020? If you're on this sub, you remember the sky was falling, we were facing systemic collapse, and we were trading around 18,000 on the Dow Jones, under 2200 on the S&amp;P. The chart looked like this:\n\n[End of week March 20th](https://preview.redd.it/bupxssadn7x41.png?width=1300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c85dbdef1e3d68a93b5a4972168df2100340943)\n\nSince then, the Fed has announced trillions in monetary stimulus, numerous programs, the SEC relaxed all sorts of rules, Congress passed 2 trillion in relief, and markets have rallied a historic amount. All bullish things, yes. But how bullish can they be, amidst a 1Q GDP blowing by the expected -3.5% to -4.8%, disastrous earnings reports, 30 million jobless claims in that same timespan, the oil sector CRASHING and trading negative for the first time ever, every economic forecasting model projecting a longer and deeper recession than previously thought, as well as every standard data point (ISM, housing, manu, etc) being more negative than the expectation. For every positive event the market has seen, there have been numerous negative events and data points, and yet this market has rallied at a historic rate: even the NASDAQ is now positive for the year. 6000 points in the Dow Jones. the S&amp;P has rallied nearly 700 points off the lows.\n\nSO let me ask that question again: what do you remember about march 18th? Well, how about this to refresh your memory:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5sjcbrhkm7x41.png?width=1850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6614cc36bb9fa85c4a0d66f8fb0a09fe0aed29e4\n\nSo, let's take a look at the chart since March 23rd, the day humans were no longer allowed to be on the trading floor, the day we decided, okay we'll trust the computers and do everything digitally, we can trust those billionaires and Market Makers and institutions regulated by a government whose very survival depends on the markets going higher regardless of the economic devastation they're going through. Let's take a look at the chart THE EXACT DAY the human element of trading was removed: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n2a8qb7np7x41.png?width=2399&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15f58eb9435214ff3691fd1f81bf2af3af6037f1\n\nYahoo Finance sucks, but I like the color feature and percentage filled in for you: a 23.58% gain. Fucking ROCKET ship. Disney has disastrous earnings, fuck it let's stay above 100. GDP blows by expectations at probably the biggest surprise in history comparing real number versus expected? Fuck it let's moon. Powell keeps printing, right, that's driving it higher, right? \n\nNo. What's driving it higher, is MMs and HFTs using programs to inflate the stocks. Retail traders make up a sliver of volume and portion of the markets. If you think some college kid YOLOing his stimulus check on options is what's bringing this market money, you're smoking crack and exactly the kind of autist we expect here on WSB. But if you're able to think critically for yourself, you'll realize why this is the biggest con we're going through:\n\nPension funds (federal state and local), Billion dollar university endowments, financial investment institutions, Hedge Funds, hold the vast majority of wealth in the markets, and they have decided along with the government, to fuck fundamentals, fuck reality, fuck the real economy, we're going to inflate the shit out of these markets and prop them up. Algorthimic trading from HFTs can easily manipulate buys back and forth. The SEC has removed all sorts of rules and regulations, and the government is going to intentionally turn a blind eye, because Capitalism itself was at stake. They're letting the market makers dictate their own reality, and we have severed ourselves from all fundamentals. \n\nSo what are the implications? For one, the market is going to trend higher until some big dog up top says it's time for a taste of reality. My guess is honestly when people return to the floors, and these funds and players have all properly hedged and prepared. They're doing some illegal shit, insane manipulation, and they're going to get away with it. To fight them, is to fight the system, and some WSB autist or Robinhood options trader aren't ever going to win that battle. One of two things is going to happen: they're going to get away with it and we accept the reality of living in a rigged market, the free market being completely dead, OR: someone comes out with a documentary exposing all this a few years from now, and gets depressed and commits suicide with a bullet to the back of their head. \n\nThe con is in, the rigging has been done, jump on board or be crushed by the corrupt who wield all that power. Prepare to do nothing but shop online with Amazon and Wayfair. Prepare to eat your veggie meat to feed the world in Beyond Meat, prepare to always watch your content heavily regulated by the Mouse, prepare to live on an internet censored by Big Tech pro China companies, and  watch as all those people who can live free thanks to Jeffrey Epstein's suicide live like gods above you.",

        "selftext": "Hello you dirty little bastards it\u2019s me, u/expander2 from the DD summaries that clog up your feed three times a week. I'm here with something a little different from what I normally do. I\u2019m gonna learn ya how to play earnings like the big shots down in NYC. Okay not really like them but I am going to teach you how to do it like you aren't the stupidest crayon in the pencil box.\n\nSo let me lay out a little table of contents for you first. I am going to;\n\n* Explain what goes into picking a play\n* Go through how to know when to sell and when to have diamond hands\n* Show some examples of earnings plays I have advocated for in the past\n* Give general pointers/ a wrap up\n* Be incredibly crude and border on stage 4 autism\n\nSo let's get right into it shall we?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How do I pick an earnings play?**\n\nFirst things first, what is an earnings play? An earnings play is when you bet, either using options or buying shares, that a company is going to either do good or bad when they report their earnings. Earnings are reported quarterly which, for most companies, means they are reported April/May for Quarter 1, July/August for Quarter 2, October/November for Quarter 3, and January/February for Quarter 4. These months are called \u201cEarnings Season\u201d. We can use earnings to decide if a company is doing good or bad and if they will do good or bad in the future. Good quarter (increased revenue, profit, etc.) stock price usually goes up. Bad quarter (net loss, supply problems, scandels, etc.) stock price usually goes down.\n\nSo how do I pick one? Well my little shit-stain, you pick a company or industry that you feel you can anticipate easily. It sounds easier than it is, I know. So let's run through a little example. You start hearing about this Covid thing in March. You think, \u201cHey, if medical PPE (personal protective equipment) is hard to come by right now, then a lot of people must be buying it!\u201d That's the first step, put two and two together and realize that world events do, in fact, influence the economy. So now that we know PPE must have a high demand, we can look to the next step which is research companies that will benefit (or do bad) if the situation in question happens.\n\nThis research is a BIG part of an earnings play. I know that here on WSB we like to jump headfirst into plays without doing any research whatsoever, but if you want to make money then I would do at least a little bit. Research;\n\n* What a company does\n* What their main sources of revenue are\n* HOW MUCH DEBT THEY HAVE\n* How much cash they have\n* And what influences their sources of revenue\n\nThe debt part is very important along with the sources of revenue and their influences. With debt you want to look for if it is manageable or not. I wont get into that here but my boy u/fuzzyblankeet writes many a great post about how to read a corporate debt sheet. Try [this post about PLAY](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fx6b0t/playtimes_over_fuzzy_does_db/) and you should have a good bit of information for that smooth brain to digest. The key takeaway is that debt and when it expires drives how a company spends their money and if they can profit in the long run. Of course, know where the company's revenue comes from. Does it come from what they produce? Does it come from advertising? Where do they attract the most customers from? What geographical area does the majority of their sales come from? Blah, blah, blah, you guys get the gist. You don't need to understand every aspect of the company, not even the CEO\u2019s know everything about their companies. You just need to know enough to comprehend where a company can go if they have a good or bad quarter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**When do I sell and when do I hold?**\n\nNow that we have a company we want to play, we buy in and wait until we get close to earnings. Unless I am getting ridiculous returns way before earnings, like 200%, I hold until I get within a few days of earnings. Now here is the tricky part. The obvious thing to do is that if you think a company is going to have a good quarter, you hold through earnings and ride that price sky high. Well, that can be true but a lot goes into it. Let's go through a few scenarios.\n\nA company is trading pretty sideways for days and days. It gets to the day before earnings and is still trading sideways, doesn\u2019t have a lot of volatility. This is a prime example of investors not really being worried about earnings at all. Earnings will still influence the price but major swings aren\u2019t likely. Earnings being good will lead to new investors buying in and bad earnings will mean investors will sell but for the most part the market doesn\u2019t anticipate anything big happening. It's best just to hold these through earnings and hope it goes the way you anticipate.\n\nThis next scenario deals with you thinking a stock is going to go up because of earnings but it will also work in reverse when dealing with put options. So earnings come out tomorrow. The price was trading steadily around $69 for the past few days. All of the sudden, the day before earnings, the price begins to shoot up to $71, then $73, then by 3 o\u2019clock it's at $75 a share. This is evidence of the market ANTICIPATING good earnings. Earnings haven't come out yet but, as we say all too often, they are already \u201cpriced in\u201d. Now when earnings come out things can pretty much go two ways. The price can continue to go up because earnings were somehow BETTER than anticipated. Or, (and this is the more likely scenario) the price will drop after earnings because they weren't quite as good as the market anticipated. This is what happens when your calls rocket in value before earnings then bottom out after, and you sit there sobbing with your tendies out the window saying, \u201cbUT EarNInGs wERe gOOD!\u201d It sucks, but I\u2019ve seen this exact scenario happen many times and it has happened to me too. So the best thing to do here is if there is a large run-up the day BEFORE earnings, take your gains before they release and don't be greedy (we will get more into that later).\n\nThe last scenario deals with more volatile stocks. Let's say you bought calls on a stock that you think is going to go up after earnings. The week of earnings it is jumping around like a nutsack on a jog. It started at $20, then dropped to $17, then up to $24, back down to $19, all the way to $27, then back down to $16 before earnings are reported. We can gather from these crazy fluctuations that there are conflicting ideas on what the results of earnings will be. From here, the best thing to do is to just stick with your DD and hold through earnings, because clearly nobody fucking knows whats gonna happen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Some real world examples**\n\nI'll break down some lingo here real quick. If you already know just skip to the next header where it says LAKE. When I say I bought calls for a certain date (4/17), I mean they expire that day and I can no longer trade them. Strike, is the number I think the share price can rise to or be on the way to when I sell. The decimal numbers (.70, 1.10) are the premium you pay per share to buy an option contract. So a .70 premium will cost $70 to buy, 1.10 will cost $110. That should let you understand a little more.\n\n**LAKE;** First, let's look at the Lakeland Industries play I advocated for a while ago. We go through the research process and decide that a medical PPE company will make money because of the coronavirus. I'll go ahead and use my own plays so I don't have to make a bunch of shit up.\n\nEarnings for LAKE came out on 4/15 after hours. On 4/8 they were trading at a low around $14.95. I bought calls for 4/17 (after earnings) at $17.5 strike for .70. Then on 4/14 I doubled down and bought calls for 4/17 at $20 strike for .30 and at that point they were trading around $16.50. Then comes 4/15, they have a run-up all day and at one point hit $18. THIS IS THE POINT I SOLD. I sold BEFORE earnings and took my profits. The $17.5 strike had jumped to 1.45 and the $20 had jumped to .65. These are both over a 100% gain.\n\nAfter close earnings were released. They were great. It showed an increase in revenue, less debt, and a bunch of other good shit. The only problem was it wasn't as high as people anticipated. On 4/16 LAKE hit lows of $15. This is just how it happens sometimes.\n\n**JNJ;** We also have the Johnson and Johnson play from the 4/9-4/13 post. They make medical stuff, home staples, you know what JNJ is.\n\nEarnings came out 4/14 before open. On 4/13 they were trading around $139.77 and this is when I bought in. I got calls for 4/17 at $147 strike for .60. That day it stayed pretty low because no one expected earnings to be fantastic. They were fantastic and the price soared to $146 on 4/14. I sold that day to lock in gains and protect myself from a sudden drop of other people cashing out their gains. The value went from .60 to 1.10 for an 83% gain.\n\nNow the price kept going up in the following days and honestly I should have held for longer. I would have if I would have bought longer dated calls. Overall, what I did here was a good choice but I could have squeezed more money out of it if I was more reckless. That is the key word, reckless. Not taking such a large gain and hoping that it will go up just a little more is reckless in the long run even if it would have worked out this time.\n\n**HAS;** Last we will look at Hasbro which a few of us got burned on last week. I bought some HAS calls for 5/8 at $85 strike for 1.10. Earnings were set to come out 4/29.\n\nThe day before earnings the price went way up for my options. I was looking at over 100% profits. This should have been the perfect sign for me to sell because earnings can't be good enough to rationalize such a run-up. I didn't sell. Earnings came out and they reported barely breaking even. Investors thought it would be a good quarter, it wasn't. Now I\u2019m stuck bagholding these options waiting for them to expire at the end of the week so they can get the fuck out of my portfolio. DON'T BE GREEDY.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**General pointers/ Wrap up**\n\nTruly, the best thing you can take away from this is to not be greedy. Take the profits you get. The difference between a 100% gain and a 100% loss can be holding just one day too long. Take in the signs and learn how to read the market trends. Price goes up before earnings? Sell and lock in gains. Price goes stagnant? Hold. Price goes opposite where you thought it would? You are either very wrong or know something that no one else does and you might as well hold.\n\nHere on WSB, the consensus is usually to make as much as possible for the meme. Well, do you want to be a meme or do you want to consistently make money. I know your answer is you want to be a meme but you know what the smart answer is. If you have over 50% gains (which is more than most professional investors make) take it. Protect yourself.\n\nAlso, if you can't afford to lose your entire account then you shouldn't be doing this. If your Robinhood balance hits $0 you should not be worrying about how you are going to pay bills it should just be an \u201coh well\u201d moment. And remember for the few and far in between moments that you do make money, put some back for capital gains taxes so you don't get fucking audited.  [This post explains](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fgfr97/taxes_how_to_treat_those_sweet_tendie_gains/) a lot that you need to know in regards to taxes. \n\nThat's all I really have for you. I hope this makes earnings plays a little easier to understand. It takes practice and practice leads to losses, just don't get too butt hurt. We all lose at some point and the only way to consistently win is to not play.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR;** Fuck you, read it. You need all the help you can get.",

        "selftext": "# Background\n\nThere's a 2007 study on the economy during, and the economic recovery following, the 1918 Spanish Influenza Pandemic (sourced below). The study concluded that employment *increased* in the US during the pandemic due to a plethora of new jobs created specific to the problem. There was no shutdown of the economy. I then looked at historical unemployment figures. It's clear to me now that there's absolutely no basis for a quick recovery of employment, especially following black swan events. The V-shaped recovery narrative is bullshit.\n\n[https://www.stlouisfed.org/\\~/media/files/pdfs/community-development/research-reports/pandemic\\_flu\\_report.pdf?la=en](https://www.stlouisfed.org/~/media/files/pdfs/community-development/research-reports/pandemic_flu_report.pdf?la=en)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Employment will take years to recover\n\nEmployment can't recover overnight. There's no basis for it. Proportional to the current workforce, the most jobs we've ever gained in a single month was in September of 1983 at 1.18 Million. After that, the jobs gain at the end of WW2 at a little over 951,000 when soldiers returned home from the war. \n\nWe're currently sitting at 36.4 Million unemployed and counting. Hourly employees have been let off; we know white collar is next (see below). The number is only going to expand in the short term. Even if it were to stop at only 40 Million (one more week of job losses), it would take 36 months of the best jobs gain ever in the history of the US to recover to February's employment levels. The argument for a quicker recovery is that many of these people will be immediately rehired. Based on my arguments below for a delayed recovery of many different businesses and significantly reduced demand, many if not most will not be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Q1 numbers were worse than you think.\n\nQ1 saw a 4.8% GDP drop, despite a positive January &amp; February. If January and February had positive GDP growth, then the March drop was proportionally equivalent to a 15-19% contraction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Analyst Q2 GDP projections are too optimistic\n\nA complete shut down of our economy has never happened before. Analysts are claiming a \\~20%+ GDP drop. It will be greater than that by as much as 10 percentage points based on unprecedented negative economic reflexivity, which is not addressed in any of these analyst models. It strains credulity to believe that people will flock to restaurants, theme parks, travel locations, community centers, festivals, concerts, sports games, etc in droves. \n\nIn fact, I think every large gathering will have low attendance and the companies that host events as their main business may find themselves without sufficient revenue to continue operations. This effect will lead to declines in revenue for many different other industries and businesses directly and indirectly. The many small businesses which profit from events, fairs, and festivals rely on a certain amount of revenue to pay for their spot at the event. These businesses will largely be defunct. \n\nOnce people decide to venture out, they'll be unable to spend at pre-covid levels due to massive unemployment. Fear will set in as revenues decline. Investment sentiment will turn negative, and low interest rates won't even be able to keep asset prices from crashing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# White collar layoffs are next\n\nPeople making \\~$250k-$1M+ at Fortune 500 firms are taking 20-50% salary reductions. Global businesses with domestic headquarters are first laying off their employees abroad, and next they will start trimming operations domestically. That's the word. On face value, it appears bullish, due to lower labor costs, but instead it shows weakness in these firms and will lead to overall declines in demand across the broad economy. There will be many companies that will find their business in shambles in this quarter, which will drag down the indexes, even if a handful sectors happen to perform well by Q2 earnings at the latest. Although, news in the interim may accelerate the timeline. \n\nCompanies with recurring revenues sourced from customers with inelastic demand, such as pharmaceutical firms and military contractors will do fine for a while, but will eventually fall as well due to high p/e relative to other income producing assets and equities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Conclusion\n\nA nationwide economic shutdown, in the manner it has been done, is like stopping a truck by running it into a wall. Large swathes of the economy have been effectively destroyed. They will have to be completely rebuilt. Demand will drop significantly for years. Employment will likely increase higher even after the economy is reopened.",

        "selftext": "**Vague Statements**\n\nSo many technical analysts talk like the Oracle at Delphi.  \"These are interesting levels to look at\" or \"This day/week/month is going to be really pivotal!\"\n\nUmm okay?  What in the fuck does that mean?  How does any of that possibly generate any trade-able insight?  Of course, it's not meant to, its purpose is to make the person sound like a wise timeless sage.  Oh how brilliant are the technical analysts that can easily discern \"interesting\" levels!\n\n**Weasel language**\n\nAnother favorite tool of technical analysts.  Saying what 'could' happen instead of what 'will' happen.  Write a long diatribe about how the current level **could** be either resistance **or** support.  Wait awhile until an up trend or down trend is clearly visible, then point to your useless piece of shit writing and say, \"you see?  What did I tell you!\"\n\n**Unfalsifiable claims**\n\nThis is a big one.  Any sleazy snake oil salesman worth his salt knows to make unfalsifiable claims.  Never ever talk about what **will** happen or even what is **probable**, but only what the **potential** is.  \"If things break down here, there is potential for further downside\" or \"Potentially, this could be massive support. Let's see what happens.\"\n\nOn the rare occasion where technical analysts go out on a limb, they always have an excuse at the ready, such as:\n\n* Technical analysis is about probability, nothing is 100%.\n* The pattern wasn't subsequently \"confirmed\".\n* There were unforseen factors.  Fuck you Fed! (When everyone and their grandma can see the continual Fed balance sheet expansion).\n* Hey man, you always have to set your stops.  \n* I was mistaken, it happens, but technical analysis works and look at all these (cherry picked) predictions that I (vaguely) got right!\n\n**Survivorship Bias**\n\nTechnical analysts **love** to bring up things that they got 'correct'.  \"Hey I told you that could be support and look at the rally since!\".  When someone is selectively bringing up their past record, they almost always leave out the ones they got dead wrong.  For example, every single month, post a quarter about how you're 'skeptical' of the market, that a collapse in equity prices is 'in the cards', and then after the 27th article, when there is finally a significant decline, make sure to bring up that article from now until kingdom fucking come.  Pin that article to the top of your twitter feed or link to it on reddit.  Doesn't matter if it took you 20 accounts to get a spectacular prediction right, people will follow a 2 week old account like lemmings.  \n\n**Analysis in Hindsight**\n\nThis by far, is imo the most annoying.  Many technical analysts, with the benefit of hindsight, like to opine about how past moves were oh so obvious well after the fact.  Whether this is done to intentionally mislead people or is the genuine expression of someone with delusional faith in magic lines can only be determined on a case by case basis, largely depending on whether or not they are selling a subscription service.  They will rarely, if ever, talk about how \"obvious\" a move **will** be but will drone on endlessly about how obvious **past** moves are.  \n\nI will say one thing about the fucking jackasses that post on loss threads with comments like \"duhhhhh you couldn't see the future!  How stupid!\": at least they are not sleazy scam artists.",

        "selftext": "Mickey Mouse reported 50 million Disney Plus subscribers on April 8th only like 6 weeks after reporting 28 million on Feb 20th.   \n\nIt's about 4 weeks later so you could see at least 15 million more subscribers not even accounting for the 20% coronavirus boost. And Similarweb shows traffic up 81% see here: https://i.imgur.com/7SWoNYb.png   \n\nIf they hit 70 million subscribers that's likely profitable. Yeah parks are going to be down, but only closed on March 12th so the impact will be barely felt into earnings. The only thing that will matter is this subscriber number. Disney will easily show that they are well capitalized and the transition to digital will show that they can weather the next year. The timing of Disney Plus is near perfect. Disney has already quickly moved movie debuts online including the amazing Artemis Fowl (if you dont have this on your calendar put it on for June 12 and then buy DIS calls then too cuz that shit is tight).\n\nHere are my bets. Had to try all the strikes and dates that way I won't get screwed by the theta meta greeks.

        "selftext": "Shoutout to u/absolutcity for beating me to the punch on this, but my team followed this one pretty heavily and I decided to give my own thoughts on the trade. \n\n \n\n**DISCLAIMER: This is an earnings play, there is always a risk of us or the institution getting it wrong. Enter at your own risk.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL,DR: Title you dipshit\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Company Overview**\n\nNYT, or New York Times, is a paper and web-based news service, and like all news publications have been heavily covering the COVID-19 crisis. NYT has its earnings later today, and we've spotted some unusual activity surrounding the 31p.\n\n**Options Activity**\n\nToday throughout the day we've seen massive sweep orders bought at the bid on the May 15th expiry 31 puts, the three largest orders being 2702, 1183, and 1374, all with aggressive purchase prices. Option volume as of 8:45 is near 11k, representing over 50% of the average daily traded volume of NYT. The large sweeps themselves are valued at over 4 million dollars in premiums paid, and our in house industry veteran has informed us this does seem like a directional play rather than a hedge for earnings due to the extremely expensive premium paid (&gt;2% of underlying).\n\nAs you read this more sweeps are coming in gradually.\n\n**Thesis**\n\nIt seems like the big boys know that NYT may not beat earnings expectations. Because of the COVID crisis most people expect news outlets to perform well, so the proper contrarian move here would be to initiate short positions. We also saw large selling action throughout the day as well, perhaps the big boys unloading their positions.\n\n**Risks:** \n\nThere is always the risk that this could be an IV momentum play, where the institutions pump up the action on the option then dump once volume picks up. Judging by the lot sizes, order flow, and fundamentals however, this seems more and more like an earnings bet.",

        "selftext": "Guys there\u2019s so much info and ppl arguing about MVIS is it true is it not. Should I sell tomorrow, should I sell before call, should I risk it all and wait. \n\nTruth is no one can tell you, but here are some pointers from the past 24hrs.\n\nMVIS is tied to MSFT, just look at their product it\u2019s literally the same thing. https://youtu.be/uIHPPtPBgHk\n\nThe volume on this guy has 190 million more than S&amp;P!!! That\u2019s 3x the amount in just one day!!\n\nThere was for a fact a whale that manipulated the price, this cause triggers to offset, with a panic sell for ppl trying to short this thing.\n\nPatent was approved today, even if you think it\u2019s false, read it carful and you\u2019ll see MVIS referenced. Again Holo lens comparison.\n\nMany MVIS employees are NOW MSFT employees, one in particular is a senior researcher (hint hint)\n\nThey are in the process to updating the holo lens to holo lens 2.\n\nMSFT can continue to pay royalties, buy them out after they\u2019ve paid their debt off, or honestly this company continues to grow because holo lens is the future.\n\nI don\u2019t believe this is a pump and dump, I believe this is to good to be true. If you want to sell to make a quick buck fine, but my own opinion, do your own DD, this guy is a win-win-win. Yes, there will be a bumpy road to the upside, but after the news either announced on the 7th after hours at 5pm, or 19th, I think based on the CEOs letter for exploring potential acquisition or merger on 5/1. We have good evidence to believe this is the real deal.\n\nMore info from investors hub\n\n\u201dEx Microsoft (MSFT) Employees now work at MicroVision (MVIS) \nAfter some research by the community, a staggering amount of ex Microvision employees have been scooped up by Microsoft over the years. This growing list leads to suggest that Microsoft is very interested in MicroVisions technology and capabilities. \n\nJosh Miller \u2013 Director of Engineering at Microsoft and former Lead Systems Engineer \u2013 HoloLens (6 years at MVIS as Director of System Engineering) \n\nScott Woltman \u2013 Director Hardware Engineering at Microsoft (5 years at MVIS as Senior Staff Engineer, Systems) \n\nRichard James \u2013 Director of Optical Engineering HoloLens, former Director of Sourcing \u2013 Advanced Optics (14 years at MVIS as Director, Opto-Mechanical Engineering) \n\nWyatt Davis \u2013 Principal Engineer at Microsoft (15 years at MVIS as Principal Engineer/MEMS Technical Lead) \n\nJeb Wu \u2013 Principal Hardware Engineer HoloLens HW Design at Microsoft (5 years at MVIS as Sr. Staff Engineer) \n\nJohnson Liu \u2013 Principal Optical Engineer (3 months at MVIS as Staff Engineer) \n\nMark Champion \u2013 Principal Systems Engineer (6 years at MVIS as Principal Engineer) \n\nMason Thomas \u2013 Principal Program Manager (3 1/2 years at MVIS as Lead Systems Engineer for DARPA eye ware display) \n\nGreg Gibson \u2013 Senior Electrical Engineer at Microsoft (11 years at MVIS as Electronics Engineering Manager) \n\nDaniel Nevistic \u2013 Hardware Development Engineer \u2013 (2 years at MVIS as Electronics Engineer) \n\nMichael Beard \u2013 Senior Optics Test Manager \u2013 HoloLens, Senior Hardware Engineer (8 years at MVIS as Lead Systems Engineer of Image Quality) \n\nShawn Swilley \u2013 Senior Hardware Engineering Manager, former Sr. Hardware Engineer (7 years at MVIS as Senior Staff Engineer) \n\nJustin Zilke \u2013 Embedded Systems Engineer (4 years at MVIS as Lead Engineer, Embedded Firmware) \n\nMinhua Liang \u2013 Optical Engineer (6 years at MVIS as Sr. Staff Engineer) \n\nDamon Domjan \u2013 Senior Embedded Systems Engineer (5 years at MVIS as Firmware Engineer) \n\nRobert Hilker \u2013 Manager HW Test Engineering at Microsoft (11 years at MVIS as Director, Global Manufacturing Technology) \n\nBill Woodland \u2013 Sr. Director Strategic Sourcing (9 years at MVIS as Sr. Director) \n\nTaha Masood \u2013 Sr. Manager for Strategic Technology Sourcing for Augmented &amp; Mixed Reality Products at Microsoft (6 years at MVIS as Director, System Engineering, Design-Win and Technology Integration) \n\nJack Clevenger \u2013 Sr. Program Manager (12 years at MVIS as Sr. Program Manager) \n\nMoh Eslamy \u2013 Process development working for both Microsoft and MicroVision (6 years at MVIS managing high volume manufacturing/assembly processing for laser projector) \n\nKarlton Powell \u2013 Senior Researcher (8 years at MVIS as Senior Research Engineer) \n\nGiven both companies are headquartered in Redmond, WA, a Microsoft acquisition of MicroVision could be an extremely easy transition for both the company and employees. \n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) currently using MicroVision (MVIS) Technology in HoloLens \nOn March 31, 2020, Microvision agreed to an agreement for its April 2017 customer to take over production of the components MicroVision had been producing for the customer. Beginning in March MicroVision started earning a royalty on each component shipped that was approximately equal to the gross profit it earned on each component it had previously produced. \n\nAround the same exact time, Microsoft started expanding production capabilities for its Hololens in order to meet higher demands for the product. \n\nAnd to follow that up, the Army which is currently planing to equip its first units with the Integrated Visual Augmentation System toward the end of next year, thanked Microsoft for the expanded commitment to meet production demands. \n\n\u201cOur Microsoft partners have been outstanding in reforming the supply chain where necessary and continuing on with the development in their production and manufacturing facility in California\u201d \n\nAnd if the dots aren\u2019t connecting enough, immediately after this on April 6th, MicroVision stated their first clue of possibly entering a buyout of some sort. \u201cAs we reported on March 11, we are actively engaged with multiple interested parties to evaluate various opportunities to license our IP as well as other strategic alternatives.\u201d \n\nWhile no one knows for sure if MicroVision\u2019s technology is in the Hololens, there have been some confirming reports stating that may be the case (found under Hybrid Arrive section). \n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\u2019s Possible Expanded Use of MicroVision (MVIS) Technology \nThe connection between MicroVision and Microsoft is almost undeniable when it comes to the Hololens reports and timelines. But an additional use of their tech may change everything. \n\n\n\nThere are rumors and evidence that Microsoft is using MicroVision technology in their new expanded capability with the Xbox. Microsoft expanding their use of MicroVision technology can show us their interest and commitment to the technology, and also validate why they might think about buying MicroVision out. \n\nIt\u2019s interesting to note that Microsoft announced an Xbox Series X gameplay reveal event for Thursday, May 7, the same day as MicroVisions conference call. Whether anything of substance is announced is yet to be seen\u201d\n\nBelow are some links! Please share info, news and insight.

In order to combat this, think long-term, sure the stock price seems like it could be dropping or rising, if you made a decision to buy a stock, you should hold on to it. \n\nNo sense making a few bucks here and there. In Canada for example using TD Web Broker, it costs $9.99 per stock transaction. Let's say for DIS, you buy at $100, sell at $105 and re-buy at $108 are you really making anything worth staring at?

They say \u201cset your stop losses tight, get out if it goes against you two ticks and move on.\u201d This is a glue-guzzling retarded thing to say and I\u2019m about to tell you why. \n\nBefore you say \u201cOh they\u2019re professional traders, they know what they\u2019re talking about,\u201d do me a favor and shut the fuck up. This is the market that\u2019s on it\u2019s way to ATH. We\u2019ve seen companies do the exact opposite of what they should do. STNG came out and made earnings their bitch and lost 10% in one day because the algos saw a downward dog trendline and a negative 50SMA. HOG came out and said they have no customers, no money, and no idea when they\u2019ll make money again and they popped 20%. \n\nIf you start with an account of $1000 and make a stupid play, you might lose 80%. Say you invested in literally anything on march 23rd. However, if you decided to be retarded like Warren Buffett and sell at rock bottom, you would have a portfolio that\u2019s worth 20% of what you started with. Why not sell and move into a different play? Because for you to take that $200 back to $1000, you would need 500% gains in a comparable amount of time as it would take for your original security to recover. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no chance that the original security will recover fully!\u201d Fucking wrong. Unless it\u2019s Luckin Coffee or some other radioactive dogshit, we\u2019ve seen time and again that stocks are only gonna go straight fuckin up for the next infinity years. Long after humans are gone algos are gonna be trading the last securities back and forth with digital money. \n\n\u201cThis is WSB, options or ban.\u201d Someone rack this faggot. I\u2019ve been on WSB for years and shares have always been part of the play. Especially right now, with IV insanely high, option premiums are through the roof and nothing is moving the way you expect it to. Buy shares in something with a low RSI, wait till it pops, and sell that shit. If it goes down, pretend its fucking bitcoin and hold it. \n\n If you wanna bitch and moan about only making 30% on a play, go to your all-time record on Robinhood and remind yourself that you\u2019re down 94% all time and you would suck a bleeding hobo dick for 10% gains. Take your favorite lipstick and write \u201cYOU ARE NOT FUCKING SMART ENOUGH FOR A TEN BAGGER\u201d on your mirror until you learn to walk away from the table with 15% in a week. \n\n\nTL;DR buy shares, hold them till they go up, sell them, repeat. If they don\u2019t go up, don\u2019t fucking sell them, and maybe your kids will sell for a gain. \n\nPositions: STNG, DHT, GLOG, UIS, INFY, MPLX.",

        "selftext": "To open I will make a bold claim, the rumors are true. Why do I think so, because that\u2019s a pre-requirement for what follows to make sense. You can call me insane, idgaf. \n\nSomeone knows the above and has orchestrated a massive scheme to profit on this fact. We\u2019ll call them whales. \n\nWhales started the buyout rumor in order to get the volume up. Nobody knows where this rumor started, MSFT using MVIS technology in their shit has been public knowledge for years. Probably pumped the stock a bit themselves, FOMO in full effect, then pumped it some more in extended hours using the fact that the volume is low, most stocks don\u2019t move much in extended hours mind you. If you look at the past few days majority of gains happened during extended hours. Let it run for a few days to further build up the volume. Pump again during extended hours, keep that FOMO going. This was Friday and Monday.\n\nThen came yesterday (Tuesday), normal start although the momentum started to fizzle down. Then came the stop raid. Why, a few reasons, get some cheap stocks, shake off a chunk of the weaker hands, get an estimate of how much you can really crash it, trigger an SSR breaker, and lower the confidence into the stock which in turn lowers the volume. Then just let it recover or pump it up a bit, you need less volume but you still need a lot of volume to pull this shit off.\n\nThis brings us into today (Wednesday), not much growth since yesterday, the momentum fizzled out but those who were holding were holding hoping to sell during late Wednesday or early Thursday or push their luck and sell before the call, few planned to actually brave the earnings report and conference call. None of us believed the rumor to be true. \n\nThen came the massive dip, courtesy of a fake news headline, bots/trolls spreading it around, and probably some good old fashioned market manipulation. \n\nThis brings us to accumulation. The chart behaved weird, frequently just trading in a 2 cent range for hours, like there were points where it broke out in either direction but it basically stayed in 1.08 to 1.10 range for a large chunk of the trading session. This brings us to the SSR breaker, once that\u2019s tripped for the rest of the trading day and the next day you can only place a short sale order at a higher price than the current price. So shorts had to play ball and sell for 1.10 or 1.09 when the price was at 1.08. A dip like that attracted a lot of shorts looking for a quick buck. The whales have eaten up all the short sales coming in and the weak hands getting out and are holding millions of shares. There was no recovery in the after hours today. Why, cause they don\u2019t need it. The minor spike in AH was probably some dumber shorts getting burned and having to cover.\n\nTomorrow (Thursday) the trading day is going to be a sideways slide with close to 0 net change, it\u2019s gonna look like the tail end of a one day runner after its done spiking, whoever was going to panic sell panic sold already. SSR breaker got tripped and volume is going to be in the gutter (buyers have no confidence in this bullshit anymore, shorts can\u2019t bring it down, whales have fed).\n\nAfter hours the rumors will be confirmed to true. Yes Microsoft or at least someone is buying, might be Facebook, might be Amazon, might be Tesla, might be someone else. Price will absolutely explode between the moment that\u2019s said and 8 PM. \n\nFriday, FOMO is again in full effect, everyone is chasing the stock, whales will either unload or just hold until buyout comes. Past Friday, who fucking cares, this is penny land after all.",

        "selftext": "Those DD posts all spammed yesterday. So much evidence the stock is going higher.\n\n-12% today.\n\nGreat work guys. DD is another way of saying \"I have no idea what I'm doing, so I'll rationalize why my trade will work.\" The mob of reddit upvotes it, because they're clueless, and now you got yourself a bunch of new bagholders.\n\nPerhaps it's a good thing these traders lose. Buying long on some of these companies, just downright stupid. \n\nStupid money is good. While it's sometimes painful to read the overwhelming amount of bullshit on this subreddit, every now and then something new comes along. Nowadays, we have the next hype stock posted daily. It's comical. \n\nHere's each point broken down:\n\n**Recklessly long-biased**\n-\n\n99.85% of all posts on here are long biased \"hot stock picks.\" I suspect many traders wouldn't be long if they had the choice. Unfortunately, robinhood and most mainstream brokers don't have the shares to borrow. So, instead of admitting it's impossible to profit long-term by swinging these pumps long, these traders double down. Like playing slots, they are always the losers, because they don't even know they are playing against the house.\n\n**Incompetent**\n-\n\nEver notice how each stock pick, those hype picks that you see on the front page, always fail? They always drop, even after a week. Those, like myself, who bring up the fact they fail, are met with usual replies:\n\n* You need to sell sooner rather than later\n\n* I bought before the pump even started\n\n* Gibberish about how the company is great\n\n* I'm a bad person for even suggesting the idea they'll fail\n\nNow all these vapid arguments all have one thing in common, the person has a vested interest in the stock. It's pretty amusing, because they create posts that are entirely emotion based. Some are more clever. Emotional based posts under the auspices of \"DD.\" I'll get to why this subreddits \"DD\" is nothing more than confirmation bias.\n\n**Shockingly uniformed**\n-\n\nNewbie traders, who admit they're new, should be given the benefit of the doubt. Although, newbies helping newbies create more newbie decisions, perhaps this is a bad cycle. While I can't prove it, sometimes there are manipulative forces that jump into subreddits like this. They mask themselves as \"arbiters of preforming proper DD.\" These people are nothing more than newsletter frauds, who have blended in to almost seem real. \n\nRead into astroturfing.\n\nEver notice how many DD posts contain a laundry list of reasons why a company is a good buy. Where is that short-biased DD? One side of the trade is correct, so perhaps there's more to it then \"microsoft may have a stake in it.\" Ironically, if you keep track of these hype stocks posted on here, all that DD is laughable. Re-read a few from a couple months ago. Check where those stocks ended up. \n\n**Never profitable long term**\n-\n\nOver the past 5 years, I've seen this subreddit grow into something pretty insane. A new stocktwits has formed. Pumpers, gullible sheep, and the occasional good trader make up the population on here. I remember posting similar things 5 years ago. These traders, who were confident in their positions at the time, would fire back at my contrarian arguments by saying my arguments are wrong. How many of these traders survived?\n\nNone.\n\nNone of those accounts, over 100 traders, survived.... except myself. I was short-biased, they were long-biased. Wave after wave, month after month, newbie traders are flushed out. Gullible traders, otherwise known as sheep, are the first ones to blow up. They are the slot machine players. The buyers into these hype stocks creating \"DD\" as a mask for their confirmation bias. \n\nCMV.",

        "selftext": " Alright autists and retards, everybody has been losing money on tankers this last week but I have news for you: your weak hands are the only reason you are losing money on tankers.\n\nIt may be a surprise to everyone under the age of 14 that the situation the tanker industry is in has happened twice in the past decade. There is a strong correlation between the oil contango and the market price of tanker stocks.\n\nAs you can see here from Euronav's investor update in April\n\n[https://imgur.com/UFgjZa5](https://imgur.com/UFgjZa5)\n\nNow that I have shown that the two are related let's take a look at the contango history:\n\n[https://imgur.com/e4Jwn76](https://imgur.com/e4Jwn76)\n\nLet's compare that to the stock price history of say STNG, NAT, ASC, FRO, and DHT:\n\n[https://imgur.com/iruMQGf](https://imgur.com/iruMQGf)\n\nIn 2008 and 2015 when the oil contango was at its highest (UNTIL NOW) these stocks were at 5-10 times what they are valued at now. It is important to note that the contango spike precedes the tanker stock price by about 6 months. But how is the contango rising compared to 2008? much faster and steadier ([https://imgur.com/oz4DplY](https://imgur.com/oz4DplY) ) What I am saying now is that these stocks are apollo 11 and you still have a chance to jump on the shuttle.\n\nLooking at earnings reports from STNG and DHT we see that they nearly made as much as the entire fiscal year of 2018 IN ONE QUARTER. No link cause I'm lazy and you people need to learn to do your own DD.\n\nSo everyone knows that the spot price is for these ships is up to as much as $110,000 (or at least you should know this because its over twice the standard rate and is RIDICULOUS) but what does that mean. Looking at ACG earnings report (I picked this one to show because its the most clear and easy to read) we can see \"Any increase in TCE goes fully to the bottom line, with every $10,000 / day increase in TCE adding approximately $90 million in earnings and cashflow annually.\"\n\nfrom ASC's highlights in the earnings report: [https://imgur.com/FNXyDMC](https://imgur.com/FNXyDMC)\n\nSo lets say they only are making $20,000 more per day per ship (its much more) and lets pick a small company like ACG that has a very small fleet of 20 tankers. That's a lot of tendies.\n\nWhat's the risk? U.S. tensions with the middle east could escalate and cut of transportation routes but I think this is very unlikely considering the pandemic.\n\nAre you worried COVID will bounce back and tank the economy so you don't want to invest? If that happens oil will go down again, storage will increase again and you will be drowning in so much cocaine and hookers you'll literally die.\n\nBuy the dip faggots.",

        "selftext": "Warren Buffett made headlines recently after his recent [virtual Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69rm13iUUgE).\n\nBuffett sold of all his shares in the major US airlines, and Berkshire announced a record quarterly net loss of nearly $50BN. Berkshire *had* held sizeable positions (around 10%) in the major US airlines.\n\nAs well as this, Buffett also allowed Berkshire's cash stake to rise to a record $137.3BN from $128BN at the end of 2019.\n\nClearly, as he is selling at a significant loss, Buffett believes that there is further pain ahead for the airlines. \n\nThe GOAT is not one to fall for the sunk cost fallacy...\n\nMoreover, his cash position indicates that he doesn't believe that we have reached the stock market bottom yet, although he wouldn't give specifics.\n\nOthers however are more explicitly bearish.\n\nThe numbers are certainly [not looking good](https://fortune.com/2020/03/20/recession-us-gdp-negative-growth-q2-predictions/)...\n\n**TRUTH 1/2:**\n\n[1640 CEOs left their posts in 2019](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/07/2019-had-the-most-ceo-departures-on-record-with-more-than-1600.html), the highest year on record since tracking began in 2002.\n\nFor context, there were 1484 exits in *2008* when the country was embroiled in the financial crisis.\n\nThis trend has continued in 2020, [in January a record 219 CEOs left their posts](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/12/rapid-ceo-turnover-continues-with-a-record-number-of-top-executives-departing-in-january.html), the highest month on record.\n\nThe economy was going to crash anyway. It was inevitable.\n\nHowever, they were afraid of massive protests against corporate greed, massive social unrest, etc so they needed a diversion that would provide an excuse.\n\nPeople will think the crash was solely due to the virus and not the numerous fundamental economic and structural issues at play.\n\nTo highlight just a few: we've had the [yield curve inversion](https://www.businessinsider.de/international/yield-curve-inversion-explained-what-it-is-what-it-means-2019-8/?r=US&amp;IR=T), the [repo madness](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-08/repo-blowup-was-fueled-by-big-banks-and-hedge-funds-bis-says), the [record corporate debt](https://www.businessinsider.de/international/us-corporate-debt-10-trillion-record-percentage-economy-expert-warnings-2019-12/?r=US&amp;IR=T), and [corporations being the main source of demand for equities via stock buybacks](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/business/stock-market-buybacks.html) which enrich executives that hit certain earnings per share targets.\n\nLast year billionaire Peter Thiel, who was part of the notorious Paypal Mafia, [spoke on the dangers of American Exceptionalism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JRyy2MM-rI). He argues that this has made America \"exceptionally un-self-critical\"\n\nWarren Buffett concluded in his virtual meeting: \"Never bet against America\"\n\nIn other words, never bet against the military industrial complex to enforce American superiority and the power of the dollar as the de facto unit of exchange globally.\n\n**TRUTH 2/2:**\n\nAs smart contracts pioneer Nick Szabo has stated:\n\n\"Buffett's wealth can be measured less in present cash than in the future cash from the Fed he is right up there at the front of the Cantillon line to get.\"\n\n[The Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs) essentially refers to the fact that fiat printing itself increases inequality. \n\nOn a more general note, it is important to remember that, despite his gentle image, Buffett is ruthless in his craft. \n\nA [New York magazine profile from 1991](https://books.google.de/books?id=veTPZA9TWxsC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=1991+new+york+magazine+warren+buffett+Warren+looks+like+a+teddy+bear,+but+mentally+is+he+ever+tough&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OT8xAOp_-y&amp;sig=ACfU3U2s1_9PvAvkaw4w5BSh0l1KgG1yhA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjtvP2__ZzpAhUG3aQKHfcYA1kQ6AEwFXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=1991%20new%20york%20magazine%20warren%20buffett%20Warren%20looks%20like%20a%20teddy%20bear%2C%20but%20mentally%20is%20he%20ever%20tough&amp;f=false) stated: \n\n\"Though he appears homey and guileless and cultivates a hayseed image, Buffett can be iron-fisted.\"\n\nAccording to a senior Salomon trader: \"Warren looks like a teddy bear, but mentally is he ever tough.\"\n\nYes, Buffett has dropped numerous gems throughout the years, but ultimately his responsibility is to Berkshire Hathaway and his own, sizeable, bags.\n\nOverall, it would be foolish to overlook Buffett's current cash position.\n\nWhen everything is dirt cheap and we do eventually hit the bottom, he will be flush with cash and ready to aggressively sweep up bargains. \n\nAt the moment, it is clear that he believes these bargains are not present, and therefore it would be wise to consider the fact that we may have further downside in store...\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsAfJMNtxsU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsAfJMNtxsU)",

We\u2019ve since seen these stocks appreciate considerably. \n\nI again [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2zhb0/taking_stock_of_tanker_stocks/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) about tanker stocks again two weeks ago encouraging many of you to hold these stocks for longer than your usual holding period of two minutes. Many of you couldn\u2019t resist the urge to take profit in advance of earnings. \n\nThat was a mistake. \n\nEarnings is the catalyst that will drive these companies higher. It\u2019s when management will reveal not only the extent to which they\u2019ve already captured outsized profits on elevated day rates but also when they will guide the market on 2Q and 3Q earnings based on the date rates they\u2019re currently contracted on. I happen to have access to that data, and those contracts happen to be at very high rates. In short, street estimates of earnings are still way too low. \n\nIn my last post I made it clear that street analysts have been too conservative in raising their earnings estimates on tanker stocks. Finally today we have Jefferies analyst raising his PTs and estimates across every tanker stock in his coverage. Just before earnings, of course.\n\nDHT PT raised from $8 to $9, 2020 EPS raised from $2.20 to $2.89.\n\nEURN PT raised from $13 to $15, 2020 EPs raised from $2.66 to $3.89.\n\nFRO PT raised from $10 to $12, 2020 EPS raised from $2.82 to $3.87\n\nTNP PT raised from $5 to $5.50, 2020 EPS raised from $1.50 to $2.13\n\nSTNG PT raised from $30 to $32, 2020 EPS raised from $6.04 to $10.59.\n\nMy plan is to hold through 2Q earnings release, but I do expect this week to be a major week for tankers with multiple names reporting. Specifically, on the calendar this week we got DHT releasing tomorrow (5/5), then STNG (5/6) and EURN (5/7). Should be wild. LFG!",

        "selftext": "Daily overview heading into the US open. The US options market opens in about 2 hours from now. Futures are up. [Prices trade on resistance](https://www.reddit.com/user/2020sbear/comments/gehuxi/were_now_back_to_2890_spx/). Our outlook for the day is bearish.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day opportunity rank: 1**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExpected opening action:\n\nSPX is trading 2890 in the futures market.  Prices making a double top in this area would signal a  downtrend through the day most likely.  I expect to see the market continue to  fall in the coming couple of hours and the US open  to be lower than the current price.  My estimate  at this point is a  low around 2865 - 2860.\n\nIf we see prices falling a bit in futures and then breaking under this level our best bet for the day is probably going to be found around the retest of the 2880 area. Here we can buy puts and use moderate strikes  of 2865 - 2860 or aggressive strikes of 2845.  This is a level where I want to take daily, weekly and monthly options.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Risk assessment of the day;**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBullish risk:\n\nTo gain any sort of control over the market the bulls have to be able to take the 2890 area.  Above the 2899 level the bulls could have a firmer grip on the market until at lest 2910.  All risk today should be confined to under the 2890 level.  2899 is the stop loss level on the day.  As the market trades right now, I think the bull risk is low,  and lower still if we fall to  2865 sort of level.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRange risk:\n\nI think  today has a very low probability of being a ranging day. I do think the market can range for a while around the 2890 price point, and I'd not expect to see this for more than 8 - 9 hours. We've been there around 6 hours now and I think (at least one way or the other) a break of the range is due and a trending day will follow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think it is very likely some sort of news that will start to make the market very volatile is due some time in the coming days or week ahead. Today we have a big opportunity to position ourselves for this. Taking quite a low  risk entry that we can cut loss on quickly if need be, and get in to the trades before the premiums rocket.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n\\----\n\nOptions trading can be very profitable but is also something that can have a lot of (especially short-term) variance. To trade options without any losses is impossible and even profitable options trading strategies are going to experience some runs of losing trades. Here are some risk awareness points anyone considering options trades based upon ideas and information posted here;\n\nDaily options 3 times rule:\n\nDaily options can produce either reasonable or exceptional gains in a small period of time. The right option on the right day is worth a fortune, but these are also the trades most likely to produce losses. When taking daily options it's best to adopt a mindset of being willing to lose the option on three attempts if required. That's not to say risk everything over three bets, it's to say bet an amount you can lose 3 times and still be fine to take other trades later.\n\nOpportunity Ranks;\n\nThere is always the option to trade, but the best opportunities to trade come along far more infrequently. Many days and weeks or trading will not present extremely high probability options trades. Using smaller bets during times when the market is offering lower odds (which is most of the time) allows for the riding of more ups and downs in losses while waiting for clearer opportunities. At times when more things line up to support the trade, it makes more sense to bet bigger on these. These are rarer opportunities.\n\nMarket conditions will be ranked as being low (3), medium (2) or high (1) probability. High probability rankings do not remove the requirement or usefulness of the three times rule. Often a big move is going to happen, but getting it on the nose first time is difficult. Hedging and Protecting Positions; It is best to ensure there is capital available to place hedge trades against options you have open if required. This should be considered before opening any trades.\n\nEverything here's educational only. You have to make your own decisions",

He described the situation as \u201cthe darkest period ever in the history of commercial aviation.\u201d\n\nAir Canada\u2019s \u201cdetermination is to ensure that our company is positioned to emerge in the post-Covid-19 world as strong as possible and capitalize on the opportunities that will inevitably arise,\u201d he said.\n\nIn contrast to major competitors around the world, Canadian airlines haven\u2019t yet received industry-specific support from the government. So far Air Canada has said it will use a 75% wage subsidy to keep or recall most of the 36,000 employees in Canada who were furloughed.\n\nFor the first quarter, Air Canada reported a loss of C$1.05 billion ($745 million) compared to a profit of C$345 million last year. On an adjusted basis, the loss was C$392 million versus a profit of C$17 million last year.\n\n\nhttps://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/air-canada-sees-pandemic-impact-lasting-at-least-three-years-1.1431037",

        "selftext": "Welcome back to the WSB DD Summary! This is for 5/2-5/4. I\u2019m your host and resident autist u/expander2. You have to be able to read to gain anything from this so that rules out about half of you. As always, ticker is in bold on the left and what I deem \"important\" is near the top of the post. A TLDR, plays, and previous DD summaries will be at the bottom. My last posts still stand and hold some good info so check it out for more plays if this isn't enough for you greedy fucks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst things first. Remember that we are reading *Money; A Suicide Note* for the [WSB Books event](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g85inu/wsbooks_vol_1_money_a_suicide_note_4pm_et_516/). It can be bought (which is recommended) or [downloaded here](https://epdf.pub/money-a-suicide-note129e7b0df400a345810ae585631783a94603.html). It will download as a LIT file then upload it to [this site](https://anyconv.com/lit-to-pdf-converter/) and re-download as a PDF. This event is aimed at making everyone a better trader and having a little autistic fun at the same time.  Now for the DD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Z;**  Let's take a look at Zillow. They are an interesting company. This is an excerpt straight from their website;\n\n&gt;Zillow serves the full lifecycle of owning and living in a home: buying, selling, renting, financing, remodeling and more. It starts with Zillow's living database of more than 110 million U.S. homes - including homes for sale, homes for rent and homes not currently on the market\n\nThey are a big business raking in $2.7 billion in 2019. However, looking at [their 10-K](https://last10k.com/sec-filings/z#link_fullReport) from that same year shows a $300 million loss which is up about $180 million from 2018. That's not good. They are consistently spending much more than they bring in but somehow are still seen as a good company. Their debt also rose in 2019 from about $700 million in long term debt to a whopping $1.5 BILLION. All these numbers are straight from their 10-K (Feel free to thank me and thank u/fuzzyblankeet too for teaching me how to understand this shit). At the end of 2019 they had 2,707 homes in their inventory. \n\nNow you ask, \u201cWhat do we do with all these big numbers that I don't understand?\u201d, and I say, \u201cYou just fucking look at them.\u201d So here is what we can take away from this. This is a company that is consistently losing money, has more than doubled their debt in a year, and much of their asset value comes from owning 2,707 houses. What happens to the price of homes in a recession? It fucking drops\u2026 like a lot. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gdbzyn/home_sales_to_fall_up_to_60/) goes over some basic stuff but more importantly it shows what they just released which is a statement saying it might take UNTIL 2021 TO RECOVER. Damn, that sucks. Earnings come out on 5/7 after close so puts for 5/15 because you can't sell options that expire that day. But more than that, this is a long term play too. Zillow will not do well in a recession and we haven't quite entered one yet. If you want, look far out for puts. Could be a smart thing especially given all this information.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Next Leg Down;** For another explanation on why we are rising in the midst of a pandemic, read this post or read the last few lines right here;\n\n&gt;This entire bull rally has been fueled by new retail investors buying the dip, bringing the stock price to euphoric levels. Over the past few weeks, we\u2019ve been seeing the people waiting at the sidelines for years to get into the stock market slowly FOMO into the rally in smaller and smaller volumes, while the smart money have been locking in their profits at an even slower rate - hence an ascending wedge. As the amount of new retail interest in the stock market started slowed down, the amount of new bulls started to decline. This doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ll instantly go back to circuit breakers, we might see 282 -&gt; 274 -&gt; 284 -&gt; 274 happen before panic, this time by the first-time investors, eventually bringing us down.\n\nI cut a couple things out so this isn't a direct quote but it's what you need to understand. Millions of first time investors are \u201cbuying the dip\u201d and when they stop doing this in such large numbers then the real gravity of the situation we are in will hit. It will be all Uh-oh\u2019s and fuck-me\u2019s from then till we hit the bottom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Oil Reminder;**  Oh and remember those tanker plays I recommended on the [4/9-4/13](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0nkrl/summary_of_dd_from_49413_insider_trading_oil/) post? Those fucking printed. So remember the [4/23-4/24](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7f1m6/dd_from_423424_live_nation_oil_starbucks_and/) post I made about land based oil storage? Those are going to print too so get in while you can. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Unusual Activity;** This isn't a big thing for me but it may help a few of you.  CNX Resources (CNX) is an oil and gas company and their earnings were terrible. Here's what is interesting; there was 32K open interest for Jul 6P, 28k puts for Oct 5p, and only 10k calls for Oct. Isn't that a little strange. That a lot of volume for a small company, seems like someone knows something we don't. \n\nThen there is Wright Medical Group NV (WMGI) which makes medical devices like joint implants and bone fixation devices for the foot and ankle and some other shit. They have 10k Aug 25P, 10k Aug 30p, and less than 4k volume for every other month. Weird. Do what you want with this information. I don't plan to do anything with these and wont include them in the TLDR or Plays. Here is [the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gcgyg5/3_unusual_options_activity_from_last_week/) going into more detail about this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast thing, I plan to make an entire separate post detailing my strategy when doing earnings plays tomorrow. I will go over how I decide when to sell and what it looks like when things go wrong. I decided to leave it out of the DD summaries because it is its own category and would take up a lot of space in already long posts. Let me know if you guys are interested in this!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck fuckers and tune in on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for more WSB DD Summaries!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR;** Zillow is absolute horse shit, next leg down is because of all the new money, land based oil is a good idea along with tankers, earnings play information session will come out tomorrow.\n\n**Plays;** Z puts for 5/15 and much farther out if you are willing to wait, MPLX, PAA, PBFX, DKL, SHLX, CNXM, MMP, and PAGP calls for late May/early June.\n\n**Previous WSB DD Summaries;** [4/23-4/24](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7f1m6/dd_from_423424_live_nation_oil_starbucks_and/), [4/25-4/27](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9a05f/dd_from_425427_the_markets_future_wingstop_huazhu/),[ 4/28-5/1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gby6ez/dd_from_42851_match_alphabet_and_a_reminder_tldr/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDISCLAIMER; I am not personally advocating for any play that I add to this list. I merely go through a couple of days of posts and find what I think is competent DD. PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK.",

        "selftext": "Yesterday a post about PTON caught my attention. It was by [/u/The\\_Big\\_Short\\_2020](https://www.reddit.com/user/The_Big_Short_2020), a new account that had lost money on Blue Apron and zero previous winning trades. Naturally I was intrigued. He is going long with over 50k in calls into Peloton's earnings call on May 6th. IV is nuts at 190% for options due May 8th. The stock is up 19.7% in the past week. He owns one of their bikes, so you already know he is biased and brainwashed. Peloton is just like a cult. Beckies and sissies paying to ride an overpriced stationary bike. Never go against a cult stock, a lesson Tesla shorts forgot about. So I had to match his retardedness by going long 53k [https://imgur.com/a/my7JJXm](https://imgur.com/a/my7JJXm) . We will see if our cumulative 6 figure investment pays off. The following is the copy past of the his position and following that the DD he posted:\n\n  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gdj3zw/holding\\_over\\_50k\\_of\\_pton\\_calls\\_ahead\\_of\\_earnings/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gdj3zw/holding_over_50k_of_pton_calls_ahead_of_earnings/) \n\nPeloton is growing rapidly - app downloads have grown tenfold. Their stock popped 5 percent when they announced that they had their largest live class (23,000 riders) over a week ago. Their previous largest live class was 19k the day after Thanksgiving.\n\nFYI - I just did a live class and there were 29k riders present; this is 20 percent higher than their previous record which again caused their stock to surge when announced - Pton chose not to announce this. Why? I\u2019m not sure, maybe saving the good news for earnings?\n\nIm also bullish after calling the peloton delivery man who set up my peloton in February. During the phone call I had with him in late March, he said that they are 3x busier than the Christmas season and that he\u2019s never seen demand like this during the two years he\u2019s been with peloton. Though anecdotal, this tells me the lead time (in my area at least) is caused by the unprecedented demand for the bike. Demand during spring is huge because typically this is Peloton\u2019s offseason. If they have christmas like demand for all of 2020, they will destroy their revenue guidance. Let\u2019s also not forget that peloton lowered their revenue guidance during their last earnings call on Feb 5th before this pandemic hit. They will absolutely crush this lowered guidance, that would have never been lowered if they knew Mother Nature was going to give them the most ideal pandemic for their business model.\n\nLastly PTON CEO John Foley said in 2018 that if peloton wanted to turn a profit, they could do so tomorrow. The reason they don\u2019t is because they want to aggressively capture market share which is why they spent nearly all their profit on commercials. Notice anything lately? Peloton hasn\u2019t been airing commercials because there is no need with demand outstripping Manufactuing. This cut in add spending, coupled with unprecedented demand will allow them to reach profitably much sooner - if they announce that they expect to be profitable in 2021 - two years earlier than planned - than this stock will fucking soar.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nA lot of people see the treadmill cancellation as a negative but I\u2019ll argue it is a positive for two reasons:\n\n1) it is a lot larger and bulkier than the bikes. One treadmill takes the space of two bikes. Also the tread is a lot more time consuming to set up - even though Pton isn\u2019t stepping inside their customers houses, they still set up the equipment outside. Bikes only allow for a greater amount of deliveries at a more efficient rate per delivery.\n\n2) Pton has better margins on their bikes versus their treads.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTDLR: Pton lowered revenue guidance in February - before the pandemic hit. If they had 20/20 vision they would have raised their guidance. Cuts in add spending, coupled with high demand will allow Pton to reach profitability MUCH sooner than originally believed. Their live rider class counts have grown over 20 percent WITHIN THE PAST WEEK. The cancellation of Pton treadmills allow for more deliveries and better margins. The guy who set up my Pton (I live in metro Detroit) told me that demand is Christmas x3 right now which tells me the long lead time is more likely caused by the spike in demand, rather than supply chain issues.",

        "selftext": "Hasn't the bull trap been fascinating to  watch?  What an incredible pendulum swing from the peak of pessimism in March to the wild splendour of predictions of the 'V' shaped recovery.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBull charge headfirst into red flags, and bear hibernate.  Here we are in the weekend of the first week of May, people's businesses are folding, renters demanding rent breaks, landlords sweating over insolvency and heart attacks just lost top spot in killer diseases to the most contagious virus any of us have ever seen in our lives; but none of this matter.

'[BRR BRR big big](https://imgur.com/a/S1T7IQQ)' is not improving real  GDP.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPeople think the market is not making sense, or not doing what it'd do if it was going to crash. This is not true. It's only not doing what you think it should do based upon what the news is telling you.  Once we'd seen the drop  of March what was to be expected was a bounce from the low and a [strong rally up to about 25,000  on the Dow peppered with positive news events.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/16/dow-jones-enters-end-of-denial-stage-and-start-of-the-bull-trap/)  All  of us who know how to trade have been waiting for that.\n\nThe market crash is going to be brutal. The second leg of the move will be bigger than the first one.  The low of the next drop can be under 50% from the high, and all the reasons people say that can't happen they said for the 2019 low breaking in  January, 2020.   A time when a 0.5% drop was considered buying the dip.\n\nWhat has taken weeks to go up will take hours to come down.  [A headline will come from no-where](https://www.reddit.com/user/2020sbear/comments/gatjxp/whatever_it_is_will_be_on_the_news/) and everything you think you know one day means nothing tomorrow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've done a lot of work on this trade.  How a trend fails and reverses is something I know a lot about. Whatever you do as an occupation and hobby - I know as much about this as you do about that. This is both my job and passion.  [I'm betting a lot of money on it,](https://www.reddit.com/user/2020sbear/comments/gbq6eu/big_short_end_of_day_3/) and I got my money by being really good at betting money in markets.\n\nI think the market is setting up to wipe people out.  Your warning sign of this is going to be the arrival of bad news in the coming week and a fall down to break the low of March. Around this time the news may seem to get better - but this will be your final chance to get out at a cheap loss (and yes, I consider a March low exit cheap relative to what June can bring).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not saying my forecasts are perfect. They are not, but they really have been good enough to do sensationally well during 2020. I've been short from feb. Long during early April and built up a short in the 24,000 - 25,000 Dow range.   I'll paste below a walk through of analysis and trades to this point. If you care to, you can check the accuracy of it and decide how useful my perspective is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\---\n\nFind a three year forecast of the [Dow Jones bear market of the 2020's here.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/16/three-year-forecast-of-dow-jones-crash/)\n\n\\---\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe US indices have been [forming a bubble](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/02/29/formingbubbles/) over the last 50 years. In 2000 and 2008 we seen the early 'Bear trap' sections of the bubble and then in the following decade we seen enthusiasm become greed and greed become delusion. The 30% gain in the S&amp;P500 through the year 2019 was the final stages of this bubble.\n\nHere is a post describing us being in the ['Delusion' stage of the bubble in January of 2020](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/SPX/KY1p7aZa-50-Years-Could-End-in-Tears-for-US-Indices/).\n\nThe pop of this bubble and the following bear market will not be a nice fast one like the crashes of 2000 and 2008, it will be a more drawn out affair where prices drop far lower. The crash of the 2020's will be more like the crash of the 1930's depression. See the analysis [leading to this conclusion here.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/01/us-indices-bubble-in-style-reflecting-the-great-depression-of-1930/)\n\nIn the months of January and February major US indices traded into the zone where a bubble template would be looking for the top to be made. Read about how this method has [worked in previous crashes here.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/05/how-technical-analysis-has-signalled-previous-stock-market-highs-and-now-again-in-2020/) First forecasts in late January were mostly stopped out. There were losing signals on the Dow [around 29,300](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/RGkn3RjW-Dow-Jones-Crucial-Support-Levels-in-the-Week-Ahead/) and some in [February at 28,900](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/xWSFpsRi-Selling-Dow-28-900/).

This did make it's high on the [exact price first posted.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/VYM/BlWd0mFm-Popular-Vanguard-Has-High-Exposure-to-Bad-Market-Conditions/)\n\nIndividual stocks picks done particularly poorly in January. TSLA almost doubled from the first [shorting price of 510.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/TSLA/FOs1PP5d-Tesla-Could-Breakdown-Soon/) Some did a bit better. [Like shorting T at 39.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/T/IUgQyy8k-AT-T-Vulnerable-Debt-Cash-Flow-Leaks/)\n\nLater in February more sell signals were generated as price traded briefly over important resistance levels. If price broke back under these it would suggest market weakness. These were [170 on VTI](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/VTI/IPRCTQh9-VTI-Enters-the-Stubborn-Stage-of-a-Possible-Reversal/) and [29,000 on the Dow.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/LiV4pmmH-Dow-Jones-Crucial-Downside-Break-Possible/) Once these levels were broken the bear market began. In the following days a signal for a [30% drop on the Dow Jones came](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/Cd6Il3np-Next-Series-of-Falls-Can-Take-Dow-Down-10-000-Points/) (and was successful).\n\nIndividual stock picks did much better in February. High prices were signalled in [MSFT](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/MSFT/LWCMh0jH-Microsoft-Setting-Up-For-Hard-Landing/), [BRK](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/BRK.A/bHDf6D7j-Buffet-s-the-King-of-the-Bag-Holders/), [SPCE](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/SPCE/uFAroqOi-SPCE-and-Gravity/), [GOOG](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/GOOG/m56g98mU-Weekly-Bearish-Butterfly-Pattern/). A high on [AMZN was called](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/AMZN/b4DOD5dy-The-Amazon-Bubble/), but price later traded higher. The best signal generated was a buy on the [TVIX from 34 to 800.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/TVIX/ts9VcIlG-TVIX-Long-Term-Trend-Line-Break/)\n\nIn the month of March , 2020, the bubble popped. Most risk based assets and indices crashed over 30%. First analysis post said to [wait for a bounce to sell into](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/nVbfBVXn-Dow-Bounces-Like-a-Brick-While-Making-Big-Breakout/), but this was updated before the market opened to say prices could fall [8% and then 30% in March.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/01/30-dow-jones-drop/) At this point the TradingView account was suspended. Only one account is allowed, and this was set up specifically for a 2020's bear market. So no further posts or updates were made there.\n\nOn the 3rd of March came the first signal to [look for the down move entering somewhere in the 16,000 - 18,000 area](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/16/dow-jones-enters-end-of-denial-stage-and-start-of-the-bull-trap/) on the Dow Jones. Followed by a post on the 16th of March saying [we're entering into the bull trap.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/31/optimism-in-the-air-as-end-of-bull-trap-approaches/) The low on the Dow would be made around 18,250 on the 23rd of March. From here a rally began which has made a current high of 24,500.\n\nApril of 2020 has been the bull trap month. Some losing signals have been generated in the later couple weeks of April. A few calls on the top of the bull trap have been made. Prices have not went substantially higher, they've just not dropped. A forecast on the [17th of April marks the current high](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/16/17th-april-2020-the-bull-trap-completes/), but it looks like price can trade a bit higher. A post on the 19th of April calls for a crash in the S&amp;P500 to [1,600 within the next 5 - 10 weeks](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/19/19th-of-april-here-comes-an-attitude-readjustment/).\n\nToday is the 25th of April. Over the last two weeks forecasts of a big drop starting have been inaccurate. I very strongly suspect this is akin to the sell signals generated in late January and early February. It's the right idea, but it's just the wrong time. A top in the Dow Jones somewhere in the 24,000 - 25,000",

        "selftext": "Calls on $RST (Rosetta Stone) for ER today AMC. Scroll to bottom for TLDR.\n\nThe value of RST isn't its consumer language business, it's Lexia, their EdTech company (which I'll get to later).  Language has been a dying business for them and the equity isn't priced for growth in that sector. That being said, consumer language is still extremely high margin; look at google search trends on rosetta stone with focus on Q1 activity:\n\n [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=rosetta%20stone&amp;geo=US](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=rosetta%20stone&amp;geo=US) \n\nAnd look at \"learn language online\" to show the interest in response to COVID:\n\n [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=learn%20language%20online](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=learn%20language%20online)  \n\nIn their PQ earnings calls they said \"In Q1, Consumer Language is off to strong start\". This was before COVID. See remarks in investor letter below (read whole thing). \n\n [https://investors.rosettastone.com/static-files/04718fc3-8017-4cc6-91df-91f1f720b19c](https://investors.rosettastone.com/static-files/04718fc3-8017-4cc6-91df-91f1f720b19c)  \n\nAgain, the equity is not about consumer language, the value in RST is in EdTech.\n\nRST owns Lexia, which is an EdTech company focused on K-12 literacy. It is doing really, really well even before COVID and is an award-winning SaaS business that doesn't have much competition. Quick link on Lexia accolade:\n\n [https://pr.rosettastone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/new-report-lexia-core5-reading-finds-percentage-k-3-students](https://pr.rosettastone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/new-report-lexia-core5-reading-finds-percentage-k-3-students) \n\nLook at what just happened with CHGG. Look at GSX (Chinese SaaS EdTech) reported this morning; although it may be corrupt Chinese fraud, they reported 307% QoQ growth in users. The CEO is a former Goldman Banker, it's a well run company, no doubt RST has been taking advantage of this situation.\n\nSee investor letter above - RST has focused on handing out licenses to schools. This is sticky business. RST usually has an extremely quiet calendar Q1 as the school sales cycle is end of summer / early fall. So expectations are low. I expect they will crush earnings and show tons of new users across all their platforms/applications. \n\nHere are really good VIC articles about the business and valuation:\n\n [https://www.valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/ROSETTA\\_STONE\\_INC/1602994739](https://www.valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/ROSETTA_STONE_INC/1602994739) \n\n [https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/ROSETTA\\_STONE\\_INC/1193337407](https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/ROSETTA_STONE_INC/1193337407) \n\nTLDR: \n\n$RST calls. Language business will benefit from COVID. EdTech market will also benefit and is key growth engine going forward. Stock is cheap. Use limit orders on options, vol is low.\n\nRST 20c 6/19\n\nRST 22.5c 9/18\n\nRST 30c 12/18",

        "selftext": "Since RTX is currently a hot topic, here's a breakdown on what the company represents. Make sure you know and understand what you are investing in.\n\n**Raytheon Technologies Corporation (RTX)**\n\nRTX was formed from the merger of United Technologies Corporation and Raytheon Company.\n\nThe company has four subsidiaries:\n- Pratt &amp; Whitney - aircraft engines and gas turbines\n- Collins Aerospace - aerospace parts and systems for commercial, regional, corporate and military aircraft; also a major supplier for international space programs;\n- Raytheon Intelligence &amp; Space - satellite sensors, satellite signal processing, radar, infrared sensors, etc\n- Raytheon Missiles &amp; Defense - precision weapons, radars, command and control systems\n\nPratt &amp; Whitney and Collins Aerospace are the merged portions from UTC. \n\nUTC spun off Otis Elevator and Carrier Corporation prior to the merger. \n\nThis makes all of RTX's revenue based on aerospace (both civilian/commercial and military) and defense. The intended goal of the merger was to make a more focused business (hence the spin-offs).\n\n**RTX Revenue Stream Breakdown**\n- Pratt &amp; Whitney - $20.9 billion net sales; 75% Commercial, 25% Military [P&amp;W Fact Sheet Available Here](https://newsroom.prattwhitney.com/collateral)\n- Collins Aerospace - $26 billion net sales; 75% Commercial, 25% Military [Collins Aerospace Fact Sheet](https://www.collinsaerospace.com/-/media/project/collinsaerospace/collinsaerospace-website/newsroom/files/collins_aerospace_fact-sheet.pdf)  \n- Raytheon - $27.1 billion net sales (RTN did not file a 2019 annual report) [2018 Annual Report](https://investors.rtx.com/static-files/4ef5db84-7cfc-41d0-9081-d22a83542afb)\n\nCollectively:\n\nUTC accounted for $35.2 billion in commercial sales and $11.7 billion in military sales\n\nRaytheon accounted for $27.1 billion in sales\n\n$74 billion altogether, with about 48% being commercial sales \n\n\n**Analysis**\n\nAlmost half of RTX's sales are related to commercial aircraft. Commercial air travel is obviously almost non-existent right now. Sales for new aircraft (and engines) will be down dramatically for an unknown but extended period of time, and aftermarket repair and maintanence will also be down. A quote on the company's trajectory/recovery from their CEO during today's conference call:\n\n    \u201cIt\u2019s not a sharp V,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is more like a U shape. I think it\u2019s going to be a full two years before we see a recovery close to what we saw in terms of 2019 levels of aftermarket. That could well be three years.\u201d\n\nTherefore, it looks like the majority of the company's income for the near future will be based on defense contracts. This might explain the recent downtrend in the stock's performance. I personally believe the company is undervalued and is a great long term buy and hold, but it may take several years for the stock to recover. Unlike most of the large defense companies out there, RTX's role in the commercial market gives them a wider range of opportunities than their competitors. Pratt &amp; Whitney's engines are widely regarded as the best on the market, and their placement on new Airbus planes means that they will have long term servicing revenue. Therefore, although they may be the weaker portion of the company in the short term, they should be able to rebound effectively.",

        "selftext": "Picture this: You're the market maker, one of the big boys. Tanker stocks are all the rage with their sweet, juicy dividends and you want a piece of the pie, so you load up on well over a million shares. Fast forward to literally anytime that isn't 2008, and you get burned. Badly. Stonks are down. But whatever, you're rich as fuck anyways so you'll have to downgrade from five hooker yachts to four. Hey, look on the bright side, you own 55% of the outstanding shares in the entire tanker sector! Well you gotta make your profits somehow, so you start selling OTM covered calls for a **fucking decade** in an industry you know is dying to continue covering your losses, and while the dividends aren't super high, they do provide a little extra income.\n\nFast forward again, this time to March of 2020: Saudi Arabia and Russia simultaneously booty bang WTI (Oil) to record lows with bigly pumps, which combined with the lack of demand from kung flu, creates a super contango so bad we end up with negative oil prices. This is the perfect opportunity for you, the market maker, to see some return on your tanker shares! After hodling for a whole decade and writing options to ignorant gamblers in a borderline dead industry, you begin to grip the bag with a raging vengeance.\n\nOne month later, it seems like the smoothbrains who day day trade bio-tech penny stocks have [found out](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gd01t7/serious_on_the_oil_demand_crisis_and_why_you/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) about the oil tankers play, and they're eating up your calls like hot cakes sending the CP ratio to 10:1. You understand that tankers are going to have [great earnings](https://www.yahoo.com/news/scorpio-tankers-stng-q1-earnings-120512118.html) and [stellar guidance](https://twitter.com/calvinfroedge/status/1258020723722981386) this quarter, so there's no fucking way you're selling your shares at a discount to these retards.\n\nOperation rugpull is a go, fuck the fundamentals, you HAVE to sell those shares until they drop to the loins of hell. SEC hasn't investigated market manipulation after orange hitler allocated all the funds to the [space force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Space_Force) (but hey, at least we don't have space commies hijacking the media to take away MUH guns &amp; freedom!) Who's going to stop you? Who gives a shit if you go on margin? You're a market maker, margin goes on you. Sell Sell Sell. You own the EVERYTHING. After retail sees share prices drop at circuit breaker levels for two consecutive days before earnings, they'll have to sell their shares like the weak paper-handed downie babies they are.\n\nAs an example, in order to prevent a single call for $STNG from expiring ITM, the share price has to be below $16 on May 15th. At this rate, we'll reach that in no time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[MAXIMUM PAIN](https://preview.redd.it/xkgps5veg9x41.png?width=1348&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6b95ea9f8a99ce4b2dbb3a6ead1abdbe000b61d)\n\nP.S. I know that the outlook on tankers for medium-long term is pretty poor with the whole \"oil demand recovery\", but regardless of that we shouldn't be seeing a stock that trades at 0.6x it's net asset value with awesome earnings &amp; guidance like this free fall. Tankers will be printing money into Q3 no matter your opinion. The rates are locked in for a decent portion of companies.\n\nTLDR: Market's rigged. Stop buying calls. You're only making the situation worse. Average down and buy shares/leaps. If someone has a better explanation for what happened the past two days then I'm all ears.",

        "selftext": "Capital One is getting squeezed. On top of the coronavirus depression, the oil futures they hold for clients caused them losses so great that they might need to register with CFTC. This is a relatively small part of their balance sheet though: the lion's share of their business is lending to Americans who can barely pay them the minimum payment each month while they extend them more credit. Sounds like an impending disaster.\n\nI have an auto loan with them and they sent me a letter saying that automatic payments must be cancelled more than three business days in advance, despite what I was \"inadvertently\" informed when I signed up for automatic payments on the app. That sounds desperate.\n\nOn the sub r/Capital One, the last few posts are from folks who are not immediately getting credit for credit card payments. I can confirm as a Capital One customer that ordinarily I receive credit immediately upon payment. This, again, sounds desperate.\n\nThe last time I posted about Capital One on this sub, several Capital One shills commented about how great the company is to work for, how allegations of their predatory lending practices are overblown etc. (\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g86bjt/capital_one_cof_is_probably_in_much_worse_shape/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)\n\nNow, curiously, the sub r/CapitalOne is locked. I attempted to post to it from a couple usernames and was informed that \"you aren't allowed to post here.\" There hasn't been a post there for 11 days - and the last ones visible are all negative.\n\nI think Capital One is going to great lengths to shore up its balance sheet by pulling out all the stops their customers agreed to in the fine print and may be involved in locking down the sub r/CapitalOne. \n\nCapital One is a lender that will be hit hard by the coronavirus depression. Many of its customers are barely able to pay their bill - in fact this is their entire business model according to the article linked to on my previous post about Capital One.\n\nWhat's in your wallet? \n\nCOF 6/19 $47.5 P",

Given that each contract is 1,000 barrels of oil, simple math tells us that $10 per barrel is a key level to watch in trading.  Should crude fall under the $10 mark, it could trigger margin calls. That could in turn force more selling to raise cash, which sends prices lower, and the vicious cycle continues.\n\n5.) Settlement for June Oil futures contacts is on May 19th. We all remember what happened the day leading up to this last month when oil went negative.\n\n6.) All of this will lead right into NAT earnings on May 18th... \n\n7.) You will hear a loud BOOM!

        "selftext": "There has been a lot of pontification recently on the Fed, QE, inflation etc. While most of these posts have good intentions, they clearly have no clue what the fuck is actually going on. This is like when an eight year old tries to explain the world to a five year old and the five year old is so impressed. It's so bad that I had to waste another hour of my day to write this way too long post to save you guys from yourselves. My last guide to the oil markets was meant to save you idiots from buying USO, but I was too late. This time I hope to reach you in time. This is a complex topic that entire books have been written about. I've skimmed over and oversimplified a lot, but it's still long so buckle up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's start from basics. First, you have to understand the difference between the Fed and the Treasury. The Treasury is the department of the government that takes in revenue (taxes) and borrows money (issuing Treasury bills/notes/bonds). For our purposes, we mostly care about the borrowing side of things. The Treasury holds almost daily auctions to issue new debt. This debt is then used to fund Congress approved government spending. Essentially investors hand over money to the Treasury in return for bonds. The mechanics of Treasury auctions are actually very interesting, but outside the scope of this post. If there's interest, upvote a comment indicating such and I will post a follow up that details how this works.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Federal Reserve is the central bank of the US. It's has a dual mandate of max employment and price stability (2% inflation). The Fed controls the amount of liquidity in the system primarily through changes in the money supply. Things can get very technical here, but at a basic level, if the fed wants to \"help\" the economy, it lowers the cost of borrowing by creating new money and buying securities (not stocks) from banks and increasing their reserves. Now that these banks have more cash, they're more willing to lend to other banks at lower rates, which lowers the Fed Funds Rate. All other rates should in theory follow. If the Fed thinks everything is amazing or even too good and is worried about inflation, then it will do the opposite by selling securities that it owns and taking back the money. The securities mentioned here are not stocks, but Treasuries, and foreign sovereign debt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow that that's clear, let's discuss monetary vs fiscal policy. Monetary policy is the realm of the Fed. They actually have a somewhat limited scope to what they can do. For the most part, they can buy/sell US and foreign soverign debt instruments to target interest rates. Recently, they've decided they can also buy bond and bond ETFs to keep corporate bond rates low. They are not allowed to buy stocks. In order to do so would require Congress to amend some laws. Fiscal policy is what Congress can do, which is pretty much anything if they can ever agree on it. Fiscal policy is financed by the Treasury department issuing more bonds. The Fed can do whatever it likes within the pre-set rules without approval from Congress. That's why monetary policy can move so quickly. However, it has those tight limits which is why Jay Powell is always telling Congress they need to do more on the fiscal side. Monetary policy = fast and unlimited in depth, but limited in breadth. Fiscal policy = slow, but unlimited in depth and breadth if Congress ever agrees. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow what the heck is QE (Quantitative Easing)? Well when the Fed wants to lower interest rates in the manner I described above, they start running into trouble when they hit the Effective Lower Bound (ELB). Here in the US we've determined that's zero. In Europe, it's somewhere around -50bps (100 bps = 100 basis points = 1%). The reason why there is an ELB is because it destroys banks. Imagine if rates were -10% (borrowers get paid 10% interest)? Banks would all be bankrupt unless they could pass this negative rate onto depositors. Smart depositors would skirt any attempt from banks by just keep physical cash under the mattress (interest rate of 0). Imagine being able to borrow at -10% and just waiting and earning 0%? For those of you are slow, that's the same as earning 10% return on your cash today. Some nobel prize winning economists have advocated getting rid of cash or making any future cash deposit worth 90 cents on the dollar to allow for deeply negative rates in the future (so keep an eye out for the war on cash). Tangent aside, once you hit the ELB, the Fed has to take different actions to put more money into the system. What they end up doing is a reverse auction where they go out into the open market and buy Treasuries and Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) from investors (notice it's not just banks here). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk, now you have the basics, let's answer some questions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Congress is doing all these bailouts how are we going to pay for it all?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCongress is doing a ton of bailouts (fiscal policy), and the Treasury will issue a ton of new debt to pay for it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Ok, but doesn't that mean interest rates are going to skyrocket?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn a vaccum this would be true. If someone is selling a ton of crap, then buyers would want to pay a lower price (charge a higher interest rate). In bond world, prices and interst rates are inverse (If interest rates go up, prices of bonds go down). However, the Fed through QE will be monetizing that debt by buying bonds through a reverse auction. Essentially, investors are just middle men, buying from the Treasury and selling to the Fed for a slight gain. So, imagine a world where someone is trying to sell you a penny for 10 dollars. You would never do that right? Well you would if you knew there was someone else you could turn around to and sell the same penny for 11 dollars to. This is essentially what's happening here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Why doesn't the Fed just buy from the Treasury?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood question, there's some laws in place that prevent that. The Fed has to buy in the secondary market (from investors) instead of the primary market (from the Fed). This is not true in some countries like the UK.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"So does that mean we can just issue as much debt as possible?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot quite. The more debt we issue, the more the Fed has to buy so that investors will be willing to pay high prices (low rates) for that debt. To do so the Fed has to print more money. The way this might eventually unravel is that the Fed will print sooooo much money that investors lose faith in the dollar. When this happens (hyper)inflation will take hold. If it gets severe enough, the Fed will be forced to raise rates, this will cause new Treasury debt to be issued at higher rates and eventually we default. This scenario is commonly referred to as the Fed losing control.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Why hasn't this happened?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis hasn't happened because we are the reserve currency of the world, we've never defaulted, and we have the strongest military.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I heard the Treasury curve inverted recently. Doesn't that mean the Fed has lost control?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo. Treasury curves \"invert\" when long term rates fall below short term rates. Intuitively, if you're going to lend someone money for 10 years you would want a higher return than for 2 years. That makes sense. When the yield curve inverts, the government is able to borrow for 10 years at a cheaper rate than for 2 years which at first glance doens't make sense. This generally happens as a part of what's called a  \"bull flattening\". Bull as in bond prices are rising (interest rates are falling). Flattening as in the shape of the curve is get getting flat (Plot time to maturity on the x axis, and the yield (for simplicity think of this as the same as the interest rate) on the y-axis. If they are the same yield, then you have a flat line. If 10 yr yields are higher than 2 yr yields you have an updward sloping \\[steep\\] line). This is generally a sign of economic weakness because investors are selling risk assets (stocks) and buying bonds and thus lowering interest rates. In a normal market, all bonds should rise and all yeilds would go down. However, since the Fed targets the front end, short rates have less flexibility to move. It's actually because the Fed is in control that the yield curve inverts. When this happens, it's generally a signal to the Fed that they should lower interest rates so that front end rates can also move down allowing the curve to steepen. If the Fed agrees with the market that things are weak they do this. If they don't, they wait and when investor confidence returns, investors sell long dated bonds and go back to buying stocks and the curve naturally steepens out again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"We already have so much debt, how can we afford to service this debt?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe debt that most of you are most familiar with are mortgages. With a mortgage, the principal is amortized over the life of the loan. With each payment some principal amount is paid off. In the government and to a lesser extent the corporate bond world, you only pay interst until the debt is due. At that point the entire principal amount is due. Even though we are issuing more debt, we are probably saving money since older debt with higher interest rates are expiring and being replaced with low interest debt. In Germany where interest rates are negative, the German government literally gets paid interest on new debt. The trouble comes at the end when the principal balance comes due. At this point, the government needs to be able to roll that debt by taking out a new loan (ideally at ever lower or more negative interest rates). So far they have had no problems thanks to the Fed/ECB/BoJ/etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"But but but... my daddy told me I'm smart and my smart brain says bonds will crash because they are selling more. You're a liar!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou want evidence? Check out what happened when QE was launched 2008-2011. Google \"bond vigilantes\". Japan has been doing all this crazy crap for decades. In the JGB (Japanese Government Bond) market, the \"bonds will crash\" trade has been known as the widowmaker since before many of you idiots were out of diapers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[5 years in the future\\] \"hah interest rates are 40bps higher than when you wrote this post! I was right!\"\n\nNo. Interest rates are most likely rising because crisis is over and the Fed is cool with interest rates going up now. This is one outcome, other outcomes include interest rates never rise (look at Europe/Japan) or we have hyper inflation. No one knows if we will have deflation or inflation in the future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditionally, here are some upvoted posts with incorrect information. I'm not calling these people out just to call them out, but rather to warn you that if you read their post and plan on making a trade based off it then here is what's wrong with what they said. I hope this helps some of those who got their faces ripped off (official trading terminology) by USO. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gbzxft/the\\_bond\\_market\\_crash\\_begins\\_on\\_may\\_12th\\_and\\_13th/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gbzxft/the_bond_market_crash_begins_on_may_12th_and_13th/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"A rising supply of debt increases interest rates... Where does this money come from? Either we borrow it or we print it. If we borrow it, interest rates will will need to rise to attract more creditors. If we print it, interest rates will need to rise to compensate for inflation. Either way, the price of previous bond issues is coming down... buy puts on bond ETFs a few days before the next auction (5/12 or 5/13)\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile the Fed is buying and people have faith in the dollar, interst rates will not rise much, and bonds will crash. There might be brief blips of a few basis points, but that's because the Fed allows it. If there is anything more than a wobble here, the Fed will institute Yield Curve Control (YCC). Currently the Fed only targets near term interest rates and allows more flexibility in longer term rates. With YCC, they will explicitly target many different maturities and keep the curve in the exact shape they like. They will do this buy buying and selling Treasuries at each maturity. They can print as many dollars as required to do this until people lose faith in the dollar. People will not lose faith in the dollar this month. Maybe in 10 or 20 years, but short dated puts are definitely going to fail. Any trade on short term time frames would be betting that the Fed wants interest rates at that maturity to rise. This seems counter to their stated goals at present. \n\n \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gesown/tea\\_leaves\\_qe\\_and\\_intl\\_demand\\_for\\_the\\_dollar\\_why/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gesown/tea_leaves_qe_and_intl_demand_for_the_dollar_why/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"QE works by selling our debt (bonds) to other countries (or large institutions) to generate liquidity, and using said liquidity (formerly for buying various Gov bonds, and since QE began, by buying bonds and other longer term securities from the private sectors)\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is almost the opposite of QE. QE is the Fed printing money and buying securities. This does generate liquidity, but I think the author doesn't know what liquidity is. Liquidity is essentially how easy it is to transact. Let's say you buy a new house and decide to sell it the next day. Chances are it will take a long time and the price you sold will be much lower than the price you bought. This is illiquid. Let's say you bought Apple stock and decided you want to sell it the next second. Chances are you can do it immediately and at pretty much the same price. Very liquid. Now imagine you're an investor who has bought a Mortgage Backed Security (MBS) and now the economy sucks and people are defaulting on their mortages. You want to sell it, but it's super illiquid now. Even though it's worth $100, no one is willing to buy it for more than $50 because they're scared too. What the Fed is doing is stepping in and buying it from you at near fair value instead of 50% lower. This then gives you capital to buy newly created MBS. It also gives other market participants confindence to increase their bids as well. If the Fed doesn't step in, you can't sell your old shitty MBS so you can't buy the new MBS. The new MBS gets stuck with the bank/originator who doesn't want it and now they can't give out any more mortgages and the whole housing market collapses. This is why the Fed is providing liquidity in all these different markets. Selling bonds to other countries would just give the Fed more dollars. They would have to do something with those dollars to increase liquidity (like buying MBS). Since the Fed can print dollars at will, they would not need the first step of selling. The Fed for the most part only sells securities to decrease liquidity. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR until people lose faith in the dollar, do not expect interest rates to increase in the US (maybe ever). Also, don't trust idiots on WSB to understand and correctly explain to you complicated financial and economic concepts. If it's anything beyond \"buy puts!!!!\" then the most likely outcome is that you will have made each other dumber.",

        "selftext": "**TL;DR**: Options trading gives you a tool to protect yourself from massive downside risk in the event that the company you work for/sector you work in goes tits up. Use options as a form of cheap insurance for your job.\n\nFirst, I'll point you to [an excellent WSB thread on hedging for options trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fn5f4p/hedging_for_autists/). You don't need to read it to understand my point, but I want you to take away these key points.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Options accomplish 2 primary things:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*They allow us to control for downside risk, similar to buying car insurance* for your speed demon of a wife. When you buy puts you are protecting yourself from losses if your long position goes tits up.      \n&gt;  \n&gt;They allow us to leverage our existing assets for greater returns. Similar to renting out your condo to buy more rental condos, you can \"rent out\" stocks that you own by selling covered calls or puts, a concept we will discuss further down. This is where Theta gang get their tendies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The strategy** I have for you is simple: Buy way OTM puts dated a year or more into the future on your company. Roll them over to a later date either quarterly or annually. In the event of a systemic shock that destroys your company, you pay yourself a fat unemployment check. If your company is too small to buy LEAPS on, find another company or two in the same industry to buy the puts on.\n\nMathematically, the goal is to spend about 1% of your annual income on these puts in such a way that if your employer collapses you secure 25% of your annual income to fall back on. If the market is efficient, this bet should pay off about 1 in 25 years. Since the business cycle lasts about 9 years, this means that you are hedging that your employer is specifically affected by an overall downturn in about one in three business cycles and gives insurance against less systemic risks that might destroy them.\n\nYou should calculate the correct strikes yourself for your employer, but a good heuristic is that a one year put 15%-25% OTM will have the correct properties. Volatile companies will have more expensive options, and therefore will require more capital to secure a potential payout of several months salary. But they are volatile for a reason and that reason likely impacts the odds you will continue having a job so the more expensive insurance is warranted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConsider these made up **anecdotes** about Frank, a Boeing plant worker, and Tom, an Enron regional energy operations manager.  The option premiums are my best estimates based off of experience buying/selling LEAPS. If you have historical premiums data I would love to see it.\n\nFrank gets paid $60k a year at Boeing. He's started making this bet every year since he started working for Boeing in 2010 after losing his construction job during the 2008 recession. At $600/year for insurance he has paid out $6000 so far. He rebalances his one put contract on 01/01/2020 paying $6/share for 2021 puts at $285 strike (\\~13% OTM). $BA hasn't been very volatile lately so the premiums are cheap. The Wuhan plague hits and $BA plunges to a low of $90. Frank sells the contract for $200/share benefiting additionally from the pump in IV. Frank makes a little under $20k on this trade which is 4 months pay. He nets $14k on the trade considering the amount he spend during previous years. Frank feels no anxiety about losing his job when the plant gets shutdown.\n\nTom get paid $400k a year at Enron. He knows some shady stuff happens at Enron, but that happens at all the energy firms he thinks. Tom has been playing this strategy since he started working for Enron in the '88. He made some money on it during an energy shock in the 90's but only enough to cover 2 years of option premiums. He rolls over his $4,000 worth of contracts in January 2001 when Enron is trading at $80, buying 12 contracts with a strike at $60 because Enron volatility has been high for $3.30/share. Later that year the Enron scandal is uncovered and the stock price collapses to $0 before the year is over. Tom makes $72k. Net after previous years is therefore $28k. He can pay the mortgage on his new and fugly Texas McMansion while he looks for a job.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Of course, the best strategy for keeping your job is to be excellent at what you do*. You can't control everything though so it pays to be prepared. If you worry that your job may ever be on the line, then this strategy is for you. It's a good way to harness the degenerate things you've learned at WSB to make sure you can sleep easy at night.",

Zoom has been getting the lion's share of attention, but Cisco has been seeing crazy growth in usage of both its teleconferencing (Webex) and VPN (AnyConnect) software. $CSCO has a lot of room to grow -- it is still down \\~28% of its 52W high.\n\nCisco's earning announcement is expected May 13th, and they'll beat their estimates.

India is prioritizing medical equipment suppliers, food processing units, textiles, leather and auto part makers among more than 550 products covered in the discussions, they said.\n\n\nTrump\u2019s move to blame China for its handling of the Covid-19 outbreak, which has killed more than a quarter-million people worldwide, is expected to worsen global trade ties as companies and governments move resources out of the world\u2019s second-largest economy to diversify supply chains. Japan has earmarked $2.2 billion to help shift factories from its neighbor, while European Union members plan to cut dependence on Chinese suppliers.\n\nFor Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a surge in investment would help shore up an economy battered by an eight-week nationwide lockdown to control the Covid-19 outbreak, and help him make up ground hitting a target to grow its manufacturing sector to 25% of gross domestic product by 2022 from 15%. The need to create employment is now even more urgent after the pandemic left 122 million people jobless and forced India to shut down all major cities.\n\nRead:India Pledges Easy Access to Land for Factories Leaving China\n\n\nIt could also present India with a chance to finally push through long-stalled reforms on land, labor and taxes that have hindered investment for years. Modi\u2019s second term has been marred by nationwide protests and slow growth since his party scored a landslide election victory a year ago, presenting a risk for companies planning to move.\n\n\u201cThere are opportunities for India to try to gain a place in global supply chains, but this will require serious investments in infrastructure and governance,\u201d said Paul Staniland, an associate professor at the University of Chicago who writes about India\u2019s politics and foreign policy. \u201cIndia faces tough competition from elsewhere in South and Southeast Asia.\u201d\n\nOfficials have told companies that India is more economical in terms of securing land and affordable skilled labor than if they moved back to the U.S. or Japan, even if overall costs are still higher than China. They have also offered an assurance that India will consider specific requests on changes to labor laws, which have proved a major stumbling block for companies, and said the government is considering a request from e-commerce companies to postpone a tax on digital transactions introduced in this year\u2019s budget.\n\nTax, Labor Laws\n\n\nIndia\u2019s trade ministry has sought detailed feedback from U.S. companies on changes needed to make the country\u2019s tax and labor laws more favorable to companies, said one of the officials. Modi\u2019s federal government is working with states to ensure long term solutions, the official added, including developing land banks to ensure a quick start for units.\n\nIndia expects to win over U.S. companies involved in healthcare products and devices, and is in talks with Medtronic Plc and Abbott Laboratories on relocating their units to the country, an official said. Medtronic spokesman Ben Petok and Abbott spokeswoman Darcy Ross didn\u2019t immediately respond to emails seeking comment.\n\nBoth Medtronic and Abbott have a presence in India, which may make it easier for them to move their China supply chains to the country, according to an official. They\u2019re based out of financial center Mumbai and already work with large Indian hospital groups.\n\n\nRead: Trump Hails Stronger India Ties With an Eye to Countering China\n\nIndia\u2019s trade ministry spokesman didn\u2019t respond to an email seeking comment on the effort to lure U.S. companies.\n\nThe push by Modi\u2019s government comes as India tries to regain lost ground after many companies chose countries like Vietnam over India as an alternative destination when Trump started his trade war with China. Modi has tried to shore up U.S. investments and improve ties through corporate tax cuts, two massive public rallies with Trump in Houston and India, and a $3 billion defense deal.\n\n\nSecretary of State Michael Pompeo last month said the U.S. was working with India, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and Vietnam on how to \u201crestructure these supply chains to prevent something like this from ever happening again.\u201d The administration was \u201cturbocharging\u201d an initiative to remove global supply chains from China, Reuters reported this week, with one official saying it\u2019s pushing for an \u201cEconomic Prosperity Network\u201d of trusted partners.\n\n\u2018Replace China\u2019\n\n\u201cMy read is that the network, if it pans out, will look to India and Vietnam to replace China in the global supply chain network,\u201d said Derek Grossman, researcher at the Washington-based RAND Corporation who held positions in the U.S. Intelligence Community for more than a decade. \u201cThis would be a rough fit in terms of replacing China\u2019s immense manufacturing capabilities, but perhaps the U.S. has high hopes that India and Vietnam can quickly ramp up to at least equal Chinese capacity.\u201d\n\nIndia in April partially lifted a ban on the export of hydroxychloroquine and paracetamol following a request from Trump. It also approved 130 billion rupees ($1.7 billion) worth of investments to make more bulk drugs and medical devices, and to boost local manufacturing of drug intermediates and active pharmaceutical ingredients to cut dependence on imports from China.\n\n\n\u201cIndia is a bigger market than Vietnam or Cambodia so it should be a bigger draw for investors looking to move operations out of China,\u201d said Ajay Sahai, director general and chief executive officer of the Federation of Indian Exporters. \u201cBut apart from ensuring land, water and sewerage, the most important change India needs to make is to give a clear guarantee that the government will not introduce retrospective tax amendments.\u201d\n\nSome states including Maharashtra have ensured that supply chains for foreign manufacturers remained functional through India\u2019s national virus lockdown. Others like Tamil Nadu in the south and Uttar Pradesh in the north have offered concessions for those planning to move.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s abundant capital in the U.S. that\u2019s looking for geographies outside, and we can see India responding,\u201d said Mukesh Aghi, president of the U.S.-India Strategic and Partnership Forum, a Washington-based group that advocates for policies that further business ties between the countries. \u201cCompanies realize that while large supply chains in China may have been economical, there\u2019s no point in keeping all your eggs in one basket.\u201d",

        "selftext": "Okay you gang of deluded retards, I'm going to drop some actual useful DD for you. tl;dr and positions at the top, because I know that for the majority of you, \"Fedex parked in front of White House, buy calls\", is as sophisticated DD as your deformed cuckold brains can handle. This is a long post so for those of you who actually want to understand why you're taking a position and learn about a commodity, read on; for those of you who don't, fuck off.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**TL;DR AND POSITIONS**\n\nTankers will have their best earnings call in at least 5 years, if not the last decade, due to all-time-high tanker rates that began spiking towards mid-March. Rates are so high that, say, companies with clean LR2 tankers currently run a spot price of 8x the 5 year historical average and 1 single 2 month voyage is enough to be profitable on the entire year. You're looking to make bets on tanker companies that are trading below their NAV, will post strong FCF, were well positioned for the spike in prices, have large fleets, and have the right types of ships. $NAT is literally the meme-iest stock because it's actually the worst across every single one of these dimensions of any tanker company.\n\n**TL;DR ON WHY NAT IS A MEME:**\n\nLet me draw you an analogy:\n\nWSB is a class in school, and you've all decided not to be homosexual for a day, and NAT is a girl in class. As a result, you all start sending her dick pics and showering NAT with attention, assuming that she is extremely high value. However, in your autistic haste, you all forgot to look around and actually there are 15 other girls in the classroom, and they are all way hotter than NAT. NAT is actually ugly and fat, but you're too busy tunnel visioning in on NAT while you beat off to realize that literally every option is better. As a result, NAT is now overvalued, but a bunch of you are stubborn fuckfaces who continue to shower her with attention because you're too autistic to admit you had no fucking idea what you were doing this whole time.\n\n**POSITIONS:**\n\n**Lowest Risk Position Examples**\n\n* EuroNav ($EURN) $12.50C 6/15\n* Scorpio Tankers ($STNG) $23C 6/15\n\n**Moderate Risk Positions**\n\n* $EURN $12.50C 5/15\n* $STNG $25C 5/15\n\n**Higher Risk Positions**\n\n* $EURN $15C 5/15\n* $STNG $30C 5/15\n\n**Legendary Autistic Risk Positions**\n\n* $EURN $17.50C 5/15\n* $STNG $35C 5/15\n* $NAT, any calls\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**SECTION 1: Overview on Oil Demand Crisis**\n\nIf you understand oil demand destruction and contango, skip ahead. However, based on the fact that people continue to pile in on USO and UCO calls and leaps under the justification of \"hurr durr oil must go up, right, so cheap\", and half of you are bagholding $NAT still, I assume 75%+ of you are retarded.\n\nMany of you still probably have no idea what's happening with oil and why it's fucked long-term. The tl;dr here is that even with OPEC+'s historical cuts, we're still drastically oversupplied. The problem with oil is it's not your meme SPY calls that are in the cloud; oil is a physical product and when you trade USO, you're trading (theoretically) on receiving delivery of oil. We are almost completely out of oil storage already.\n\nYou may ask, well [u/safuros](https://www.reddit.com/u/safuros/), if that's true, why don't we turn off the wells? Markets naturally handle supply and demand. Well, you worthless piece of shit, while your child-groping Honors Econ teacher may have drawn a graph once upon a time in high school when you still had the potential not to be a useless person as you are now, oil production isn't that simple. The reason every country is sandbagging and trying to get other countries to cut oil is that there's a game theory element in play, as well as an oil well intrinsic function issue.\n\nOnce oil wells reduce their production to roughly 50-60% of output, they *cannot go any lower* without risking destroying the well, which is extraordinarily expensive to get the rights to drill on and also is like throwing out a gallon of water when you've only taken a sip. Thus, the only option to reduce further is to entirely stop production and cap the well, and then, assuming your lease on the well hasn't lapsed by the time you can re-open it, uncap it, both of which are extraordinarily expensive. Therefore, most oil companies are far, far better off continuing to produce oil at a loss, because that's still a long-term better play than turning off. Moreover, why the fuck should you be the well to turn off, if other's aren't? Add in the fact that everyone cheats on oil production cuts and the Saudis and Russians are trying to fuck each other and the US in the ass, and you've got a nice oil crisis.\n\nThis leads to the USO/UCO shit show and negative WTI price. Normally, futures holders offload their contracts to buyers who intend to actually take physical delivery as the option expiration date draws near. However, because there is no storage and no demand, none of the typical buyers actually wanted to buy, so you had a bunch of tendie seeking autists desperately trying to offload their contracts so that they wouldn't have 5 dumptrucks of oil barrels delivered to their homes and be completely fucked, such that they were willing to *pay* people (i.e. negative price) to take their contracts. As for contango, well, google it.\n\nFinally, this problem isn't going away any time soon because unless you're so truly deluded as to believe that we'll not only have a V shaped re-opening in terms of social, commercial, and consumer behavior, but that fuel consumption across airlines and cars will rebound immediately, we're on a long term path to recovery, and we're already out of supply. This is like having a clogged bathtub full of water and turning the faucet from 100% on to 50% on - you're still fucked until the faucet turns off (impossible) or the clog goes away more than enough to offset the faucet (not happening for a while). This is why experts broadly agree that [the OPEC+ cuts are meaningless](https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/4/21/opecplus-mega-deal-rendered-meaningless-by-demand-destruction) and that groups like Morgan Stanley believe [demand destruction of oil will persist until well into 2021](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Morgan-Stanley-Oil-Demand-Wont-Return-To-Normal-Until-End-2021.html).\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**SECTION 2: A brief overview of Tankers**\n\nYou don't need much of a brain to understand, given the above, why tankers stand to benefit from demand destruction. However, there are many types of tankers, and it's not as obvious as hurr durr buy tankers. Each tanker type carries a different type of product, has a different size, and commands a different rate. Here is the current rates:\n\n[3 key types of tanker business models, spread across a variety of tanker variants](https://preview.redd.it/hd3q2ncaqmw41.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fca616d8afc83afa14721af8e2e5bd1bf243fadd)\n\nAt this point I'm realizing that this post is getting way too long and i'm tired of typing it already, but do your own research on types of tankers. You can see though that tankers are commanding a stupidly high rate compared to their historical values:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q8u5q1odqmw41.jpg?width=1081&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bc3668993ed1965a45f8c9af5a7a07f16e851b5\n\nThe current rates are so high that [one spot voyage is profitable on the entire year](https://www.tradewindsnews.com/tankers/tanker-rates-one-spot-voyage-makes-the-whole-year-in-red-hot-market/2-1-801368).\n\n&gt;\"If an MR can get $30,000 per day on a spot voyage, it covers its costs for a year...If an LR2 gets $150,000 or $160,000 a day, it\u2019s the same...you could lay the ship up, earn zero for the next ten months, and still make a profit on the ship.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Guess who owns the most clean-fuel ready LR2's that are exposed to the spot price? $STNG](https://preview.redd.it/iyeeu45gqmw41.jpg?width=894&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b23175ca9c77eb406cadc5b01411c22545e72d59)\n\nNow, don't be stupid and assume that rates will hold this high all year. That said, even if rates went to $0 by mid summer, the rates for Q2 are so high such that it'd still be a higher revenue year than last year. And rates aren't going to $0...they're going to continue to stay above the historical average, just not as high as now, due to the crazy demand destruction.\n\n* **Miscellaneous point of clarification:** I see a lot of dumbasses posting about what numbers will look like if the entire fleet is booked out for, say, NAT. That's ridiculous and not how it works, so don't just go number of tankers x spot rate = revenue for year = tendies.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Section 3: Why $STNG and $EURN?**\n\nI really need to go fuck your wife soon, so I'm making the sections shorter and shorter. But i'll still tell you way $STNG and $EURN are good bets. First, let's start with NAV - **N**et **A**sset **V**alue. If you don't know what this means, Google it.\n\nAs you (should) know, NAV is something you estimate and can be calculated differently based on different assumptions. Trading below NAV means the stock is underpriced as is, and that's before record earnings and guidance. By most accounts, $EURNs NAV is at least $13 currently, and $STNG is close to $30. They trade at $10 and $21, respectively, right now.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$STNG isn't even at it's average price for 2019, but 2020 is objectively a better year unless a meteor blows up their fleet](https://preview.redd.it/smsydzfnqmw41.jpg?width=2001&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b4de32295c00a853844ad5de51c44e7aeabbe0c)\n\nSecondly, fleet size and type. $STNG has one of the largest fleets in the world, and in particular, they have the most LR2 tankers. If you go back up to the graph, you'll see that clean LR2 tankers are commanding an absurd rate, spiking to as high as $250,000 for a few days and currently settled around $150-175k/day, compared to a 5-year historical value of below $25k. $EURN has a solid fleet of VLCC's which are commanding a strong rate, and EURN has good financials - most their boats are fairly new, they don't have a ton of debt.\n\nLastly, they're among the first up on the earnings block, with STNG reporting 5/6 this week and EURN reporting on 5/7. Compare that to NAT, who reports the 23rd, so theta will eat away at what remains of your atrophied testicles every day. That said, regardless of theta, STNG and EURN are really strongly positioned.\n\nI expect that earnings will be solid and likely beat, but not by a crazy amount because rates only started really jacking up in late March, and rates in early Q1 were actually pretty low. However, as many of you still don't fucking understand, **earnings don't matter nearly as much as** **guidance.** That's why you dumbfucks all complain about companies beating earnings but still tanking and then creating stupid conspiracy theories about \"MM is fucking rigging this market\". Guidance for tankers is going to be **euphoric**.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Section 4: Why is $NAT a meme, and mistakes I see people making**\n\nUltimately, this comes down to people angling towards the right space (tankers) but you've been too stupid to do any research. You probably do this for all your bets, because you're a fucking autist, but you should stop.\n\n1. Fleet size misconception: Cramer meme'd NAT, infamously calling out that they have the largest fleet in the world. In fact, if you actually tried to verify anything you ever fucking did, you could have googled this and realized that NAT has a fleet that, just like your dick, is one of the smallest around. Moreover, they have the wrong type of boats - they primarily have Suezmax boats, which command an okay rate, but aren't close to the best boats to have right now.\n2. No investigation of NAV: NAT's NAV, by all accounts, is close to $3. They are trading at close to $6, and were nearing $8-9 at peak pump. Why the fuck on god's green earth would you buy a company with the wrong type of boats, the wrong fleet size, trading at over 2x NAV, when everyone else is around or below their NAV and has a better fleet?\n3. Massive debt and shitty assets: NAT is saddled in debt, is historically shittily managed (read their earnings report if you know how, but you probably don't know how), and all their boats are at the end of their lifetime, meaning NAT not only has horrible debt but will need to buy a shit ton of new boats very soon\n4. Stupid assumptions on revenue: We covered this earlier, but no, just because demand is high, it doesn't mean every boat is going to get booked at the spot price. Many boats are on existing contracted rates from last quarter, and the ones who are not are not all getting booked out at once.\n5. Looking at ATH as an indicator: If i see another one of you dumb fucks pointing out that NAT used to trade at $16 5 years ago, I will personally find you, tape you to a chair, and shit down your mouth. NAT has issued a shit ton more shares. You are probably the same group who thinks that USO went from $2 to $18 last week.\n\nThe ONLY justification for NAT is now that it's been memed and retail knows all about it, it will probably rise again if the other tankers do well. You can make that play, and you might even make money. Just make sure to dump that shit before earnings because they're not going to be good enough to justify the rise and there's going to be a stupid dump.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**MY POSITIONS:**\n\n\\- 40 $STNG 5/15 $23C\n\n\\- 200 $EURN 5/15 $12.5C\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\n\nFuck you",

Stop losses are triggered making things worse\n3. Other buyers panic and sell (possibly even for losses)\n4. When the time is right and it's low enough, the whale buys back in chunks so the price doesn't sky again.\n\n5.

        "selftext": "**TL;DR**: China needs dollars badly, not gay little treasuries yielding 1%. They will not purchase treasuries at the next auctions and interest rates will spike. Chaos in the bonds market will lead to chaos in the stock market. Bears,go in for the kill. Bulls, close your long positions on the 11th and reopen them at noon on the 13th. What makes this play so beautiful is just how well it can be timed. $TLT ATM put 5/15 purchased 5/11.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\\*\\*Automod didn't like the full post, I'm going to be editing this together in parts to figure out what word or phrase is triggering it, bare with me here\\*\\**\n\nThis post will start off with some ECON 101 shit for the autists who never learned the basics. If you already know why bond prices move in  the opposite direction as interest rates and why China buys so much US debt, then skip ahead. The bond market dwarfs the size of the stock market, there is about 9 times as much outstanding bond value as there is total market cap. Bonds are where the big boys play.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Interest rates and bond pricing\n\n**When interest rates rise, the prices of old bonds fall, and when interest rates fall, the prices of old bonds rise.**\n\nConsider a zero coupon bond, one where you pay a certain amount and at the end of the bond term you get paid back more (unless you\u2019re a cucked German bond buyer). For a one year bond with a 5% yield, you would pay$95.24 for the privilege of redeeming the bond for $100 in one year\\[Formula:(end value \u2013 price)/price = interest rate\\]. But what if the next day interest rates fall to 3%? The bond you just bought suddenly looks a lot more attractive. Its yielding a lot more than the bonds the suckas are buying today. If you turned around and sold it the next day, you could scalp off the extra yield and sell it as though it were 3% bond. Using the same formula, you could sell it for $97.04. Nice. If on the other hand, the interest rate rose to 7%then everyone trying to make a buck would want the bonds they buy to yield 7%. In order to sell your 5% bond, you would have to take a loss to make it attractive. The new price of the same bond would be $93.48.\n\n**The sensitivity of a bond\u2019s price to interest rates, depends on the bond\u2019s time to maturation.**\n\nThe more years a bond has to collect interest, the more the rates affect the bond\u2019s price. Consider a bond that pays 5% a year, compounded annually. In practice, only savings bonds compound, but any bond can be recalculated as if they compound. That bond would cost $231.38 and pay out$1000 at maturation \\[Formula: end value = price \\* interest rate \\^ years\\]. If the next day, interest rates increased to 7%, U R FUK. That bond would now sell for a paltry $131.37. If interest rates fell to 3%, your investment would nearly double to $411.99. If they fell to 1% you could sell that bond for$741.93. Damn WSBGod. That\u2019s the power of compound interest. Below in the DD section, there\u2019s a more realistic graph showing approximately how $TLT will respond to interest rate movements.\n\n**Interest rates depend upon supply and demand for a bond.**\n\nThe fundamental rule of microeconomics: prices are set by supply and demand. Therefore, the discount and interest payments of a bond depend crucially on what market participants want, their *demand*.  Suppose you know a company, Widgettech, that sells widgets is run by a  complete moron and that Widgettech is trying to raise capital by selling bonds. There\u2019s another company WidgetDotCom, run competently, that currently sells their zero coupon bonds with a 3% discount. Would you buy Widgettech bonds at 3%? Hell no. You need to receive a premium for that. The same is true for government bonds: th eUS 10 year is trading at 0.6% interest while the Brazilian 10 year is trading at 8% interest. Investors need to be compensated for the risk that Brazil can\u2019t pay them back. Demand for crappy bonds is low. Demand for good bonds is high\n\n*Supply* is another fundamental issue. If you want $100 to YOLO, you could probably get a loan from your dad. If you want to YOLO $10 million you\u2019re going to need to look elsewhere. The larger the loan you want, the more market participants you\u2019re going to need to engage. To get that  $10 million you\u2019re probably going to need to put your tin cup before a bunch of banks and all your friends and family. To make them pay any attention to you, you\u2019re going to need to make them a damn good offer. It can\u2019t be the \u201cI\u2019ll pay you back next week\u201d that you might do with your dad. It would have to be \u201cI\u2019ll pay you back an additional 50%.\u201d When a company or nation wants to take on substantially more debt, they will need to raise the interest rate to get more people to drop some change in the tin cup they\u2019re rattling.",

        "selftext": "I know many of us here are confused by the apparent disconnect between the market and real boots on the ground economy. A report just came out showing over 20.5 million Americans lost their jobs in April. We're now at a a top level unemployment rate of 14.7%. The Dow is up over 350 points as I type this.\n\nWhat CNBC and other media outlets won't tell you in their hacky \"[Why the stock market is up even with historic job losses](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/08/why-the-market-is-up-even-with-historic-job-losses.html)\" articles, is that quite a few public companies can weather the storm, while many main street businesses will close permanently. In other words, large corporations are essentially \"buying out\" these small businesses in the long run. Throw in automation and an increasingly specialized workforce, and we are witnessing the acceleration of the 4th industrial revolution, which ultimately benefits Wall Street.\n\nWhile everyone's distracted with bitter partisan politics, global mortality leaderboards and the usual nonsense in popular media, the largest wealth exchange in history is going completely unnoticed right under our noses. I don't think many of us plebs can appreciate the magnitude of what's going on. If I was a conspiracy theorist, which I most definitely am not, I would say they couldn't have dreamt up a more perfect scenario for the wholesale theft of main street businesses.\n\nI don't have time to get into the numbers, but that's the gist of it.

        "selftext": "During one of the coronavirus task force briefings, an admiral came up and detailed how he was getting ventilators into the system. Much of the press was outraged when he detailed it out because the government was using a middle man that was profiting off it. The admiral\u2019s response? \u201cMy job is not to invent a system. My job is to put volume in the system.\u201d\n\nSuch is the realities of leadership in a time of crisis.\n\nSo. When the Fed went into \u2018save everything mode,\u2019 they did so with a desire to unfreeze credit markets and make sure markets functioned. Powell\u2019s job was to put volume into the system.\n\nThat system now has volume. And plenty of it. Everyone is buying everyone else\u2019s debt. Disney wants five billion for a year? Wells Fargo says \u2018COUNT ME IN.\u2019 Boeing is issuing bonds? \u2018IT\u2019S A RAID,\u2019 says every person with access to debt markets. Delta can\u2019t fly 10% capacity this quarter. People buy their debt like it\u2019s the liftoff of the 747.\n\nSo the system now has ample volume going back and forth. Everyone\u2019s leveraged to the tits in new debt. What could possibly go wrong?\n\n30-50 million unemployed is what\u2019s wrong.\n\nAlready high household debt continues to skyrocket as new income falls off a cliff is what\u2019s wrong.\n\nReckless debt issuance and a borrowing system that never really reset after 2008-9 is what\u2019s wrong.\n\nIn what will likely go down as the dumbest FOMO among smart money of all time, every major institution has tried its best to get in on every company\u2019s debt offerings. But what happens if Delta sees just 30% of flying traffic in the third quarter? What if California and France refuse to open Disney\u2019s parks until early July and shut them down again in September as precaution? And would anyone really be surprised if Boeing doesn\u2019t get the 737 max off the ground until 2021?\n\nThese events have a decent probability of happening. And such companies as Delta and Boeing may not be able to service their debt at the end of 2020 if, say, we have to shut everything back down to prevent a second wave.\n\nNot every bond holder is going to get screwed. But the rate of defaults on loans is going to be much higher than the laughable estimates JPM and Well\u2019s have set cash aside for.\n\nLet\u2019s keep in mind: it wasn\u2019t the Fed\u2019s job to invent a new system. Its job was to keep the current system functioning.\n\nSo what is the system they\u2019re pumping? The debt system. And all they\u2019ve really done is re-inflate a debt bubble to a much bigger size than it was in February. And given the details released today by the Fed essentially announcing they'll be buying HYG and LQD, this bubble is growing to hindenburg-sized levels.\n\nWith people putting their rent on credit cards, our system is just surviving right now. But what happens in wave two?\n\nBoeing can\u2019t pay its coupon as Delta withdraws all orders so it can attempt to service debt too big to pay itself. An empire like Disney looks at risk for shuttering. Restaurants are seen as germ lands by the average consumer and nobody goes dining in for several years. Housing construction companies simply cannot survive the epic demand and supply destruction with defaults on mortgages skyrocketing as well. Fannie and Freddie make 2008 look like a prelude to the real story. And the Fed may have to try and get out of HYG as companies in the ETF fail and they have to preserve tax payer dollars as per their legal obligation, which will only further feed the negative feedback loop.\n\nAt Buffet\u2019s shareholder meeting saturday, he praised Powell\u2019s speed to get credit markets functioning again. On top of that, he said March was the highest bond issuance month of all time, followed by April breaking that record.\n\nBut here\u2019s what\u2019s interesting in what he said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the consequences of this will be.\u201d\n\nSo perhaps we are somehow able to punt the debt bubble pop down the road by allowing all loans to defer for extended periods. Perhaps the US government is able to find some way to write off certain types of debt in a last resort effort to avoid economic catastrophe. They will certainly get creative as everyone becomes desperate. But in all likelihood, these kinds of ideas are untenable without resulting in extreme damage to other segments of the economy.\n\nWe are on the brink of the debt bubble collapse. And given a second wave, we will create a negative feedback loop that will slump the United States Markets for years.\n\nI don't believe we will have a 10 year great depression. We learned so much from that time period and we will use that knowledge to recover faster, and maybe even better. But like the civil war, world war one, and world war two: everyone thought at the beginning of each outbreak it was only going to last a few months. We think the same thing now about this crisis.\n\nTL;DR: Often when you are operating in a paradigm you don\u2019t realize the flaw of that paradigm until you are forced to shift into a new paradigm. The debt bubble paradigm is about to shift, but not before it pops.",

        "selftext": "TLDR: we're all sheep heading to the slaughter.\n\nWhat do you remember about March 23rd, 2020? If you're on this sub, you remember the sky was falling, we were facing systemic collapse, and we were trading around 18,000 on the Dow Jones, under 2200 on the S&amp;P. The chart looked like this:\n\n[End of week March 20th](https://preview.redd.it/bupxssadn7x41.png?width=1300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c85dbdef1e3d68a93b5a4972168df2100340943)\n\nSince then, the Fed has announced trillions in monetary stimulus, numerous programs, the SEC relaxed all sorts of rules, Congress passed 2 trillion in relief, and markets have rallied a historic amount. All bullish things, yes. But how bullish can they be, amidst a 1Q GDP blowing by the expected -3.5% to -4.8%, disastrous earnings reports, 30 million jobless claims in that same timespan, the oil sector CRASHING and trading negative for the first time ever, every economic forecasting model projecting a longer and deeper recession than previously thought, as well as every standard data point (ISM, housing, manu, etc) being more negative than the expectation. For every positive event the market has seen, there have been numerous negative events and data points, and yet this market has rallied at a historic rate: even the NASDAQ is now positive for the year. 6000 points in the Dow Jones. the S&amp;P has rallied nearly 700 points off the lows.\n\nSO let me ask that question again: what do you remember about march 18th? Well, how about this to refresh your memory:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5sjcbrhkm7x41.png?width=1850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6614cc36bb9fa85c4a0d66f8fb0a09fe0aed29e4\n\nSo, let's take a look at the chart since March 23rd, the day humans were no longer allowed to be on the trading floor, the day we decided, okay we'll trust the computers and do everything digitally, we can trust those billionaires and Market Makers and institutions regulated by a government whose very survival depends on the markets going higher regardless of the economic devastation they're going through. Let's take a look at the chart THE EXACT DAY the human element of trading was removed: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n2a8qb7np7x41.png?width=2399&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15f58eb9435214ff3691fd1f81bf2af3af6037f1\n\nYahoo Finance sucks, but I like the color feature and percentage filled in for you: a 23.58% gain. Fucking ROCKET ship. Disney has disastrous earnings, fuck it let's stay above 100. GDP blows by expectations at probably the biggest surprise in history comparing real number versus expected? Fuck it let's moon. Powell keeps printing, right, that's driving it higher, right? \n\nNo. What's driving it higher, is MMs and HFTs using programs to inflate the stocks. Retail traders make up a sliver of volume and portion of the markets. If you think some college kid YOLOing his stimulus check on options is what's bringing this market money, you're smoking crack and exactly the kind of autist we expect here on WSB. But if you're able to think critically for yourself, you'll realize why this is the biggest con we're going through:\n\nPension funds (federal state and local), Billion dollar university endowments, financial investment institutions, Hedge Funds, hold the vast majority of wealth in the markets, and they have decided along with the government, to fuck fundamentals, fuck reality, fuck the real economy, we're going to inflate the shit out of these markets and prop them up. Algorthimic trading from HFTs can easily manipulate buys back and forth. The SEC has removed all sorts of rules and regulations, and the government is going to intentionally turn a blind eye, because Capitalism itself was at stake. They're letting the market makers dictate their own reality, and we have severed ourselves from all fundamentals. \n\nSo what are the implications? For one, the market is going to trend higher until some big dog up top says it's time for a taste of reality. My guess is honestly when people return to the floors, and these funds and players have all properly hedged and prepared. They're doing some illegal shit, insane manipulation, and they're going to get away with it. To fight them, is to fight the system, and some WSB autist or Robinhood options trader aren't ever going to win that battle. One of two things is going to happen: they're going to get away with it and we accept the reality of living in a rigged market, the free market being completely dead, OR: someone comes out with a documentary exposing all this a few years from now, and gets depressed and commits suicide with a bullet to the back of their head. \n\nThe con is in, the rigging has been done, jump on board or be crushed by the corrupt who wield all that power. Prepare to do nothing but shop online with Amazon and Wayfair. Prepare to eat your veggie meat to feed the world in Beyond Meat, prepare to always watch your content heavily regulated by the Mouse, prepare to live on an internet censored by Big Tech pro China companies, and  watch as all those people who can live free thanks to Jeffrey Epstein's suicide live like gods above you.",

        "selftext": "Hello you dirty little bastards it\u2019s me, u/expander2 from the DD summaries that clog up your feed three times a week. I'm here with something a little different from what I normally do. I\u2019m gonna learn ya how to play earnings like the big shots down in NYC. Okay not really like them but I am going to teach you how to do it like you aren't the stupidest crayon in the pencil box.\n\nSo let me lay out a little table of contents for you first. I am going to;\n\n* Explain what goes into picking a play\n* Go through how to know when to sell and when to have diamond hands\n* Show some examples of earnings plays I have advocated for in the past\n* Give general pointers/ a wrap up\n* Be incredibly crude and border on stage 4 autism\n\nSo let's get right into it shall we?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How do I pick an earnings play?**\n\nFirst things first, what is an earnings play? An earnings play is when you bet, either using options or buying shares, that a company is going to either do good or bad when they report their earnings. Earnings are reported quarterly which, for most companies, means they are reported April/May for Quarter 1, July/August for Quarter 2, October/November for Quarter 3, and January/February for Quarter 4. These months are called \u201cEarnings Season\u201d. We can use earnings to decide if a company is doing good or bad and if they will do good or bad in the future. Good quarter (increased revenue, profit, etc.) stock price usually goes up. Bad quarter (net loss, supply problems, scandels, etc.) stock price usually goes down.\n\nSo how do I pick one? Well my little shit-stain, you pick a company or industry that you feel you can anticipate easily. It sounds easier than it is, I know. So let's run through a little example. You start hearing about this Covid thing in March. You think, \u201cHey, if medical PPE (personal protective equipment) is hard to come by right now, then a lot of people must be buying it!\u201d That's the first step, put two and two together and realize that world events do, in fact, influence the economy. So now that we know PPE must have a high demand, we can look to the next step which is research companies that will benefit (or do bad) if the situation in question happens.\n\nThis research is a BIG part of an earnings play. I know that here on WSB we like to jump headfirst into plays without doing any research whatsoever, but if you want to make money then I would do at least a little bit. Research;\n\n* What a company does\n* What their main sources of revenue are\n* HOW MUCH DEBT THEY HAVE\n* How much cash they have\n* And what influences their sources of revenue\n\nThe debt part is very important along with the sources of revenue and their influences. With debt you want to look for if it is manageable or not. I wont get into that here but my boy u/fuzzyblankeet writes many a great post about how to read a corporate debt sheet. Try [this post about PLAY](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fx6b0t/playtimes_over_fuzzy_does_db/) and you should have a good bit of information for that smooth brain to digest. The key takeaway is that debt and when it expires drives how a company spends their money and if they can profit in the long run. Of course, know where the company's revenue comes from. Does it come from what they produce? Does it come from advertising? Where do they attract the most customers from? What geographical area does the majority of their sales come from? Blah, blah, blah, you guys get the gist. You don't need to understand every aspect of the company, not even the CEO\u2019s know everything about their companies. You just need to know enough to comprehend where a company can go if they have a good or bad quarter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**When do I sell and when do I hold?**\n\nNow that we have a company we want to play, we buy in and wait until we get close to earnings. Unless I am getting ridiculous returns way before earnings, like 200%, I hold until I get within a few days of earnings. Now here is the tricky part. The obvious thing to do is that if you think a company is going to have a good quarter, you hold through earnings and ride that price sky high. Well, that can be true but a lot goes into it. Let's go through a few scenarios.\n\nA company is trading pretty sideways for days and days. It gets to the day before earnings and is still trading sideways, doesn\u2019t have a lot of volatility. This is a prime example of investors not really being worried about earnings at all. Earnings will still influence the price but major swings aren\u2019t likely. Earnings being good will lead to new investors buying in and bad earnings will mean investors will sell but for the most part the market doesn\u2019t anticipate anything big happening. It's best just to hold these through earnings and hope it goes the way you anticipate.\n\nThis next scenario deals with you thinking a stock is going to go up because of earnings but it will also work in reverse when dealing with put options. So earnings come out tomorrow. The price was trading steadily around $69 for the past few days. All of the sudden, the day before earnings, the price begins to shoot up to $71, then $73, then by 3 o\u2019clock it's at $75 a share. This is evidence of the market ANTICIPATING good earnings. Earnings haven't come out yet but, as we say all too often, they are already \u201cpriced in\u201d. Now when earnings come out things can pretty much go two ways. The price can continue to go up because earnings were somehow BETTER than anticipated. Or, (and this is the more likely scenario) the price will drop after earnings because they weren't quite as good as the market anticipated. This is what happens when your calls rocket in value before earnings then bottom out after, and you sit there sobbing with your tendies out the window saying, \u201cbUT EarNInGs wERe gOOD!\u201d It sucks, but I\u2019ve seen this exact scenario happen many times and it has happened to me too. So the best thing to do here is if there is a large run-up the day BEFORE earnings, take your gains before they release and don't be greedy (we will get more into that later).\n\nThe last scenario deals with more volatile stocks. Let's say you bought calls on a stock that you think is going to go up after earnings. The week of earnings it is jumping around like a nutsack on a jog. It started at $20, then dropped to $17, then up to $24, back down to $19, all the way to $27, then back down to $16 before earnings are reported. We can gather from these crazy fluctuations that there are conflicting ideas on what the results of earnings will be. From here, the best thing to do is to just stick with your DD and hold through earnings, because clearly nobody fucking knows whats gonna happen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Some real world examples**\n\nI'll break down some lingo here real quick. If you already know just skip to the next header where it says LAKE. When I say I bought calls for a certain date (4/17), I mean they expire that day and I can no longer trade them. Strike, is the number I think the share price can rise to or be on the way to when I sell. The decimal numbers (.70, 1.10) are the premium you pay per share to buy an option contract. So a .70 premium will cost $70 to buy, 1.10 will cost $110. That should let you understand a little more.\n\n**LAKE;** First, let's look at the Lakeland Industries play I advocated for a while ago. We go through the research process and decide that a medical PPE company will make money because of the coronavirus. I'll go ahead and use my own plays so I don't have to make a bunch of shit up.\n\nEarnings for LAKE came out on 4/15 after hours. On 4/8 they were trading at a low around $14.95. I bought calls for 4/17 (after earnings) at $17.5 strike for .70. Then on 4/14 I doubled down and bought calls for 4/17 at $20 strike for .30 and at that point they were trading around $16.50. Then comes 4/15, they have a run-up all day and at one point hit $18. THIS IS THE POINT I SOLD. I sold BEFORE earnings and took my profits. The $17.5 strike had jumped to 1.45 and the $20 had jumped to .65. These are both over a 100% gain.\n\nAfter close earnings were released. They were great. It showed an increase in revenue, less debt, and a bunch of other good shit. The only problem was it wasn't as high as people anticipated. On 4/16 LAKE hit lows of $15. This is just how it happens sometimes.\n\n**JNJ;** We also have the Johnson and Johnson play from the 4/9-4/13 post. They make medical stuff, home staples, you know what JNJ is.\n\nEarnings came out 4/14 before open. On 4/13 they were trading around $139.77 and this is when I bought in. I got calls for 4/17 at $147 strike for .60. That day it stayed pretty low because no one expected earnings to be fantastic. They were fantastic and the price soared to $146 on 4/14. I sold that day to lock in gains and protect myself from a sudden drop of other people cashing out their gains. The value went from .60 to 1.10 for an 83% gain.\n\nNow the price kept going up in the following days and honestly I should have held for longer. I would have if I would have bought longer dated calls. Overall, what I did here was a good choice but I could have squeezed more money out of it if I was more reckless. That is the key word, reckless. Not taking such a large gain and hoping that it will go up just a little more is reckless in the long run even if it would have worked out this time.\n\n**HAS;** Last we will look at Hasbro which a few of us got burned on last week. I bought some HAS calls for 5/8 at $85 strike for 1.10. Earnings were set to come out 4/29.\n\nThe day before earnings the price went way up for my options. I was looking at over 100% profits. This should have been the perfect sign for me to sell because earnings can't be good enough to rationalize such a run-up. I didn't sell. Earnings came out and they reported barely breaking even. Investors thought it would be a good quarter, it wasn't. Now I\u2019m stuck bagholding these options waiting for them to expire at the end of the week so they can get the fuck out of my portfolio. DON'T BE GREEDY.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**General pointers/ Wrap up**\n\nTruly, the best thing you can take away from this is to not be greedy. Take the profits you get. The difference between a 100% gain and a 100% loss can be holding just one day too long. Take in the signs and learn how to read the market trends. Price goes up before earnings? Sell and lock in gains. Price goes stagnant? Hold. Price goes opposite where you thought it would? You are either very wrong or know something that no one else does and you might as well hold.\n\nHere on WSB, the consensus is usually to make as much as possible for the meme. Well, do you want to be a meme or do you want to consistently make money. I know your answer is you want to be a meme but you know what the smart answer is. If you have over 50% gains (which is more than most professional investors make) take it. Protect yourself.\n\nAlso, if you can't afford to lose your entire account then you shouldn't be doing this. If your Robinhood balance hits $0 you should not be worrying about how you are going to pay bills it should just be an \u201coh well\u201d moment. And remember for the few and far in between moments that you do make money, put some back for capital gains taxes so you don't get fucking audited.  [This post explains](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fgfr97/taxes_how_to_treat_those_sweet_tendie_gains/) a lot that you need to know in regards to taxes. \n\nThat's all I really have for you. I hope this makes earnings plays a little easier to understand. It takes practice and practice leads to losses, just don't get too butt hurt. We all lose at some point and the only way to consistently win is to not play.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR;** Fuck you, read it. You need all the help you can get.",

        "selftext": "What people right now are expecting to happen, is that states will reopen, and people will wait and see if there are news of a \"second wave\" or new infections. And then people will all panic and realize that we're either back to lockdown or half a million people will die, or it magically \"disappear\". Only then, people are assuming that the market will react.\n\nBut the other investors on the other side are just as smart as you. There are probably very few people who think reopening will not cause a rise in infection. The smart money is definitely not that dumb. This is hot potato and the first to leave wins. \n\nThis has to happen before you're expecting it, because the smart money has no reason to stay that long if they can leave before it. Why would they? Would you do it? They won't wait for the news they know will come. Hell I bet some of them even control when the media calls it \"second wave\". It's all very arbitrary, calling it waves gives the media the power over public opinion. It's open to interpretation. But call it a second wave and there you go, you have the public primed for a sell sign. That sell sign will come as a scare, to squeeze people to panic sell, not as the trigger to the initial selloff. Prices will be already low when that happens and they will use that to maximize buying. They would want those headlines to come when they can push stocks below their worth, not as a reminder to correct their prices.\n\nA \"second wave\" headline will happen because the media won't be silent over fast increasing case counts. Retail investors will sell on that news. Smart money won't let other investors pull out before the headline comes, if they can maximize their sell before. \n\nSo the question, what is the timeline you think this will happen. And then the smartest reaction is to exit this earlier than all people here think.\n\n**So when do you think news will announce \"second wave\" ?**\n\nIt's also OK to post \"I don't think there will be a second wave\", or \"second wave won't crash the market, it's priced in\", or \"The market will crash only after we know states reaction to the second wave\". Would you sell on \"second wave\" news?\n\nI'm guessing not more than 2-3 weeks until someone says Texas has a \"second wave\" (A rise in infections, although they never really reduced them anyway).",

With dollar signs in my eyes I tried my hardest to unlock the green RH theme buying $ROPE and $CSV like the memes said, but I was #redgang until all my savings were gone. So I studied all the DD posts for months, made new savings, and set out to lose that too. I found a JavaScript machine learning tutorial on YouTube and got to work, mostly watching tendie porn on wsb every few minutes to refresh my false sense of hope.\n\nNow my script is finished, using machine learning on every DD thread I could find, analyzing the resistance, taking into account I, II, III, IV crush groups like they said, and cross referencing the greeks against fibonacci sequencing models. Everything I could possibly learn from WSB, I fed into the machine learning script so it generates a list of the top 69,420 positions on the market every time I open Internet Explorer.

        "selftext": "In the equity market, fear of missing out seems to be overshadowing fear of all that\u2019s wrong with the economy. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. says pessimism will soon get the upper hand and send the S&amp;P 500 Index down almost 20% in the next three months.\n\nFiscal and monetary support over the past few weeks of the coronavirus pandemic successfully warded off a financial crisis, but a return to economic normalcy is still a long ways away and investors have gotten ahead of themselves, the bank\u2019s chief U.S. equity strategist, David Kostin, wrote in a report.\n\nFinancial, economic and political risks darken the outlook for domestic equities, Goldman warns. The bank cites the lack of flattening in the U.S. infection curve outside of New York, what promises to be a lengthy re-start process, a 50% hit to buybacks in 2020 and the risk of higher corporate taxes and de facto consumption taxes if U.S.-China trade tensions bubble up again.\n\n\u201cA single catalyst may not spark a pullback, but a number of concerns and risks exist that we believe, and our client discussions confirm, investors are downplaying,\u201d Kostin wrote. Goldman says the S&amp;P 500 will probably drop to 2,400 over the next three months before it rebounds to 3,000 by year end.\n\nThe index slumped 0.5% Monday to 2,914 as of 9:45 a.m. in New York.\n\n\nKostin notes that large swaths of the investor community have failed to cash in on the S&amp;P 500\u2019s 31% surge since its trough on March 23. He points out that most mutual funds have underperformed since the bear market low, with long/short and macro hedge funds posting single-digit returns as a group, and investors may face pressure to chase the rally.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018fear of missing out\u2019 best describes the thought process,\u201d Kostin said.\n\nFutures positioning shows investors still doubt S&amp;P 500 rebound\n\nBut he warns that it\u2019s a risky move. Even with measures of the breadth of the recent rally improving in recent days -- potentially signaling more buy-in on the idea the gains will last -- Goldman Sachs\u2019 sentiment indicator has barely improved since mid-March.\n\n\u201cSkepticism abounds regarding the likelihood the rally will continue,\u201d the strategist writes.\n\nrelates to Goldman Says Stocks Due for 18% Drop After Rally Driven by FOMO\nKostin is pessimistic on the outlook for corporate profits, citing frozen growth plans and capital expenditures will drop 27% this year. He points out that the only encouraging driver for earnings is the swelling federal deficit, which in effect acts as substantial support for demand.\n\nCaution on equities may also be warranted in the face of stretched valuations -- to the extent that anything about 2021\u2019s bottom-line outlook can be discerned.\n\nThe benchmark U.S. stock gauge trades at 19.5 times the buy side\u2019s estimate of next year\u2019s earnings, Kostin concludes, the highest level since 2002.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-11/goldman-says-stocks-due-for-18-drop-after-rally-driven-by-fomo?sref=s0L1qQ1H",

        "selftext": "One thing I have learned trading this market for many years is that the fundamentals always play out. The question is all about timing. If you sold when SPX was near the bottom, you\u2019d be massively screwed. \n\nThe fundamentals are bad. Unemployment figures are rising. Many companies have slashed a ton of their profits. Even though the economy is about to re-open, the impact of this on the stock market hasn\u2019t been felt yet and the effects will last a long time. \n\nThe truth is that this drop never happened because of COVID in the first place. It happened because of companies being overvalued and inflated resulting in an eventual collapse. COVID was just a trigger and those fundamentals are still in play. Just two years ago, nearly half of unicorns overstated their valuations, and it got much worse last year and this year: https://www.barrons.com/amp/articles/the-vc-bubble-is-going-to-burst-51553077853. The VC bubble still hasn\u2019t popped yet. \n\nNow, why do I think it is finally time that we drop now, and why do I think we drop this fast? Why do I think this is not just another one of those \u201cHaha it\u2019s going to crash\u201d posts we\u2019ve seen over the last two months? It\u2019s simple. Retail volume has been washed out and reached a peak last week. You can see this through aggregate order flow on stocks most traded by retail such as TSLA (which will drop the hardest). You can see this through the number of people holding stocks like that on Robinhood which has the most retail volume. The influx of retail traders reaching a peak during a rise or during a drop (which occurred at low 220s) is generally indicative of a top or bottom in case of a downtrend. \n\nWhen retail volume peaks in a market where the fundamentals are telling the opposite story, you go short, and you go bigly short.\n\nTL;DR P SPY 240 MAY 22",

        "selftext": "# Background\n\nThere's a 2007 study on the economy during, and the economic recovery following, the 1918 Spanish Influenza Pandemic (sourced below). The study concluded that employment *increased* in the US during the pandemic due to a plethora of new jobs created specific to the problem. There was no shutdown of the economy. I then looked at historical unemployment figures. It's clear to me now that there's absolutely no basis for a quick recovery of employment, especially following black swan events. The V-shaped recovery narrative is bullshit.\n\n[https://www.stlouisfed.org/\\~/media/files/pdfs/community-development/research-reports/pandemic\\_flu\\_report.pdf?la=en](https://www.stlouisfed.org/~/media/files/pdfs/community-development/research-reports/pandemic_flu_report.pdf?la=en)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Employment will take years to recover\n\nEmployment can't recover overnight. There's no basis for it. Proportional to the current workforce, the most jobs we've ever gained in a single month was in September of 1983 at 1.18 Million. After that, the jobs gain at the end of WW2 at a little over 951,000 when soldiers returned home from the war. \n\nWe're currently sitting at 36.4 Million unemployed and counting. Hourly employees have been let off; we know white collar is next (see below). The number is only going to expand in the short term. Even if it were to stop at only 40 Million (one more week of job losses), it would take 36 months of the best jobs gain ever in the history of the US to recover to February's employment levels. The argument for a quicker recovery is that many of these people will be immediately rehired. Based on my arguments below for a delayed recovery of many different businesses and significantly reduced demand, many if not most will not be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Q1 numbers were worse than you think.\n\nQ1 saw a 4.8% GDP drop, despite a positive January &amp; February. If January and February had positive GDP growth, then the March drop was proportionally equivalent to a 15-19% contraction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Analyst Q2 GDP projections are too optimistic\n\nA complete shut down of our economy has never happened before. Analysts are claiming a \\~20%+ GDP drop. It will be greater than that by as much as 10 percentage points based on unprecedented negative economic reflexivity, which is not addressed in any of these analyst models. It strains credulity to believe that people will flock to restaurants, theme parks, travel locations, community centers, festivals, concerts, sports games, etc in droves. \n\nIn fact, I think every large gathering will have low attendance and the companies that host events as their main business may find themselves without sufficient revenue to continue operations. This effect will lead to declines in revenue for many different other industries and businesses directly and indirectly. The many small businesses which profit from events, fairs, and festivals rely on a certain amount of revenue to pay for their spot at the event. These businesses will largely be defunct. \n\nOnce people decide to venture out, they'll be unable to spend at pre-covid levels due to massive unemployment. Fear will set in as revenues decline. Investment sentiment will turn negative, and low interest rates won't even be able to keep asset prices from crashing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# White collar layoffs are next\n\nPeople making \\~$250k-$1M+ at Fortune 500 firms are taking 20-50% salary reductions. Global businesses with domestic headquarters are first laying off their employees abroad, and next they will start trimming operations domestically. That's the word. On face value, it appears bullish, due to lower labor costs, but instead it shows weakness in these firms and will lead to overall declines in demand across the broad economy. There will be many companies that will find their business in shambles in this quarter, which will drag down the indexes, even if a handful sectors happen to perform well by Q2 earnings at the latest. Although, news in the interim may accelerate the timeline. \n\nCompanies with recurring revenues sourced from customers with inelastic demand, such as pharmaceutical firms and military contractors will do fine for a while, but will eventually fall as well due to high p/e relative to other income producing assets and equities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Conclusion\n\nA nationwide economic shutdown, in the manner it has been done, is like stopping a truck by running it into a wall. Large swathes of the economy have been effectively destroyed. They will have to be completely rebuilt. Demand will drop significantly for years. Employment will likely increase higher even after the economy is reopened.",

        "selftext": "**Vague Statements**\n\nSo many technical analysts talk like the Oracle at Delphi.  \"These are interesting levels to look at\" or \"This day/week/month is going to be really pivotal!\"\n\nUmm okay?  What in the fuck does that mean?  How does any of that possibly generate any trade-able insight?  Of course, it's not meant to, its purpose is to make the person sound like a wise timeless sage.  Oh how brilliant are the technical analysts that can easily discern \"interesting\" levels!\n\n**Weasel language**\n\nAnother favorite tool of technical analysts.  Saying what 'could' happen instead of what 'will' happen.  Write a long diatribe about how the current level **could** be either resistance **or** support.  Wait awhile until an up trend or down trend is clearly visible, then point to your useless piece of shit writing and say, \"you see?  What did I tell you!\"\n\n**Unfalsifiable claims**\n\nThis is a big one.  Any sleazy snake oil salesman worth his salt knows to make unfalsifiable claims.  Never ever talk about what **will** happen or even what is **probable**, but only what the **potential** is.  \"If things break down here, there is potential for further downside\" or \"Potentially, this could be massive support. Let's see what happens.\"\n\nOn the rare occasion where technical analysts go out on a limb, they always have an excuse at the ready, such as:\n\n* Technical analysis is about probability, nothing is 100%.\n* The pattern wasn't subsequently \"confirmed\".\n* There were unforseen factors.  Fuck you Fed! (When everyone and their grandma can see the continual Fed balance sheet expansion).\n* Hey man, you always have to set your stops.  \n* I was mistaken, it happens, but technical analysis works and look at all these (cherry picked) predictions that I (vaguely) got right!\n\n**Survivorship Bias**\n\nTechnical analysts **love** to bring up things that they got 'correct'.  \"Hey I told you that could be support and look at the rally since!\".  When someone is selectively bringing up their past record, they almost always leave out the ones they got dead wrong.  For example, every single month, post a quarter about how you're 'skeptical' of the market, that a collapse in equity prices is 'in the cards', and then after the 27th article, when there is finally a significant decline, make sure to bring up that article from now until kingdom fucking come.  Pin that article to the top of your twitter feed or link to it on reddit.  Doesn't matter if it took you 20 accounts to get a spectacular prediction right, people will follow a 2 week old account like lemmings.  \n\n**Analysis in Hindsight**\n\nThis by far, is imo the most annoying.  Many technical analysts, with the benefit of hindsight, like to opine about how past moves were oh so obvious well after the fact.  Whether this is done to intentionally mislead people or is the genuine expression of someone with delusional faith in magic lines can only be determined on a case by case basis, largely depending on whether or not they are selling a subscription service.  They will rarely, if ever, talk about how \"obvious\" a move **will** be but will drone on endlessly about how obvious **past** moves are.  \n\nI will say one thing about the fucking jackasses that post on loss threads with comments like \"duhhhhh you couldn't see the future!  How stupid!\": at least they are not sleazy scam artists.",

        "selftext": "TLDR: PCG 20 strike september or PCG 15 calls for may 29 should print. \n\nPCG is about to climb out of bankruptcy with an impending vote coming out soon. The deadline for the victims\u2019 vote on the settlement agreement is this Friday. \n\nPCG will rise (much like it did in January) due to anticipation for the vote. Given that 98% of victims thus far that have caster votes are in favor of the settlement, we will most likely see a case where PCG will exit bankruptcy by June 30. That\u2019s why big whales have parked themselves in OTM september 20 strike calls. However, the near term momentum that the positive vote will provide will also make sure that we see a rally in PCG\u2019s stock through the end of may. Given that analysts have slapped new price targets despite the possibility that the vote may not be a done deal, you can probably expect higher price targets when the vote actually goes through. \n\nTimeline: last vote by may 15 and results will come out the week after, so may 29 calls are good for this. September 20 strike also has incredible OI and liquidity so those are most likely going to rocket if PCG picks momentum to 17 during May (much like the runup from early Jan to mid February that was caused by the anticipation of pcg leaving bankruptcy. \n\nBasically, buy pcg calls for end of may and september",

Enter at your own risk.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL,DR: Title you dipshit\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Company Overview**\n\nNYT, or New York Times, is a paper and web-based news service, and like all news publications have been heavily covering the COVID-19 crisis. NYT has its earnings later today, and we've spotted some unusual activity surrounding the 31p.\n\n**Options Activity**\n\nToday throughout the day we've seen massive sweep orders bought at the bid on the May 15th expiry 31 puts, the three largest orders being 2702, 1183, and 1374, all with aggressive purchase prices. Option volume as of 8:45 is near 11k, representing over 50% of the average daily traded volume of NYT. The large sweeps themselves are valued at over 4 million dollars in premiums paid, and our in house industry veteran has informed us this does seem like a directional play rather than a hedge for earnings due to the extremely expensive premium paid (&gt;2% of underlying).\n\nAs you read this more sweeps are coming in gradually.\n\n**Thesis**\n\nIt seems like the big boys know that NYT may not beat earnings expectations. Because of the COVID crisis most people expect news outlets to perform well, so the proper contrarian move here would be to initiate short positions. We also saw large selling action throughout the day as well, perhaps the big boys unloading their positions.\n\n**Risks:** \n\nThere is always the risk that this could be an IV momentum play, where the institutions pump up the action on the option then dump once volume picks up.

Beginning in March MicroVision started earning a royalty on each component shipped that was approximately equal to the gross profit it earned on each component it had previously produced. \n\nAround the same exact time, Microsoft started expanding production capabilities for its Hololens in order to meet higher demands for the product. \n\nAnd to follow that up, the Army which is currently planing to equip its first units with the Integrated Visual Augmentation System toward the end of next year, thanked Microsoft for the expanded commitment to meet production demands. \n\n\u201cOur Microsoft partners have been outstanding in reforming the supply chain where necessary and continuing on with the development in their production and manufacturing facility in California\u201d \n\nAnd if the dots aren\u2019t connecting enough, immediately after this on April 6th, MicroVision stated their first clue of possibly entering a buyout of some sort. \u201cAs we reported on March 11, we are actively engaged with multiple interested parties to evaluate various opportunities to license our IP as well as other strategic alternatives.\u201d \n\nWhile no one knows for sure if MicroVision\u2019s technology is in the Hololens, there have been some confirming reports stating that may be the case (found under Hybrid Arrive section). \n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\u2019s Possible Expanded Use of MicroVision (MVIS) Technology \nThe connection between MicroVision and Microsoft is almost undeniable when it comes to the Hololens reports and timelines. But an additional use of their tech may change everything. \n\n\n\nThere are rumors and evidence that Microsoft is using MicroVision technology in their new expanded capability with the Xbox. Microsoft expanding their use of MicroVision technology can show us their interest and commitment to the technology, and also validate why they might think about buying MicroVision out. \n\nIt\u2019s interesting to note that Microsoft announced an Xbox Series X gameplay reveal event for Thursday, May 7, the same day as MicroVisions conference call. Whether anything of substance is announced is yet to be seen\u201d\n\nBelow are some links! Please share info, news and insight.

Today is that day for me!\n\nBut while noticing that, I also noticed that BRK-A, which has tracked the S&amp;P 500 fairly closely in recent years has lagged in the last month of the recovery. BRK-A put in its all-time high close on the same day the market peaked (February 19) at 344k vs. 3386 for the market. However BRK-A is currently trading at 276k vs. 2843 for the market, which represents about a 3.5% under-performance, all of which accrued during the month of April. Berkshire's defensive posture paid off during the crash, as it bottomed at around -30% vs. the market's -35%, but that seems to have reversed in April.

        "selftext": "The fundamentals and the \u201cfeel\u201d of the markets are broken right now. Just like Goldman Sachs announced yesterday (5/11/2020), I think that there is a very good chance of a second crash coming to the markets.\n\nSo far, I trust my gut. I've been correct many, many times so far. In early January, I knew the market was coming down. On February 3rd, I even made a video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRmJPgljdG4) to sell stonks. I got laughed at.\n\nTurns out, a few weeks later exactly what I said would occur happened. Early March, Markets Crashed \\~30%. Based on a text I sent on Sunday, March 22, I said \u201cI don\u2019t see it dropping much further.\u201d I came to this conclusion because I got news alerts that \u201cPowell: Federal Reserve Pledges Unlimited Quantitative Easing to Keep Markets Functioning\u201d and gut feeling the CARES ACT was nearing from drafting to negotiation phase. I bought, and told people to buy now.\n\nEnough humble bragging. As soon as this happened, the FED bailed out the market. **RULE #1**: DON'T FIGHT THE FED.\n\nAnyway, the next day (Monday, March 23rd) the Fed did come in. Since that day, the Markets have \u201crecovered\u201d.\n\nThe markets are going to experience a second dip. Since early April, I\u2019ve expected a \u201cW\u201d recovery rather than a \u201cV\u201d, \u201cU\u201d or \u201c\u221a\u201d recovery. Every day we move on, the more confident I become. Here are some reasons I predict a second dip:\n\n1. States will issue a second lockdown phase. High chance this may happen very soon (people freak out over confirmed cases/deaths next week as there is a 2week incubation period) or a spike in the fall. Prediction: 50%.\n2. The shutdown is dragged out way too long. States are crazy enough to extend until mid June. Who\u2019s gonna stop them from shifting the goalposts into August, November, 2021? I see draconian states being crazy enough to do this. Prediction: 100%.\n3. People will realize unemployment numbers are not \u201ctemporary\u201d, but permanent. The market seems to expect a quick bounce in the unemployment numbers, but I truly do not think this will happen. Prediction: 95%.\n4. Consumer spending/demand does not return. I see Q2 financial reports being a much bigger dumpster fire than predicted. April is expected to be bad, but May and June are expected to be a return to normal. I do not see this. Prediction: 80%.\n\nWith one of these  or a mix of these happening, I see a second dip in July/August.\n\nWhat will cause this second dip to recover? The Fed. Markets will keep falling, until then they drop \\~20% and the Fed comes back again.\n\nI predict the Fed will announce negative interest rates. President Trump wants this so badly, and it's one of the most powerful tools the Fed has to pump the market. I don\u2019t even think the market needs to dip again for this to happen in the near future.\n\nI predict this will happen before the election. (September/October). Once this happens, there is no stopping how high stocks will go. As the great Warren Buffett says \u201cInterest rates are like gravity in valuation. If interest rates are nothing, values can be almost infinite. If interest rates are extremely high, that's a huge gravitational pull on value\u201d.\n\nGet those financial news apps installed on your phone ASAP. Fox Business, CNBC, etc. I DON'T CARE. Even if my prediction of a second dip is wrong, as soon as you hear that the Fed announces negative interest rates, go ALL IN. I won't tell you what stocks to buy, but as I said before: **DON'T FIGHT THE FED**. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;in before \"this guy is full of shit\". I'm just writing my prediction",

        "selftext": "A lot of traders like to make fun of this mentality. They say \u201cset your stop losses tight, get out if it goes against you two ticks and move on.\u201d This is a glue-guzzling retarded thing to say and I\u2019m about to tell you why. \n\nBefore you say \u201cOh they\u2019re professional traders, they know what they\u2019re talking about,\u201d do me a favor and shut the fuck up. This is the market that\u2019s on it\u2019s way to ATH. We\u2019ve seen companies do the exact opposite of what they should do. STNG came out and made earnings their bitch and lost 10% in one day because the algos saw a downward dog trendline and a negative 50SMA. HOG came out and said they have no customers, no money, and no idea when they\u2019ll make money again and they popped 20%. \n\nIf you start with an account of $1000 and make a stupid play, you might lose 80%. Say you invested in literally anything on march 23rd. However, if you decided to be retarded like Warren Buffett and sell at rock bottom, you would have a portfolio that\u2019s worth 20% of what you started with. Why not sell and move into a different play? Because for you to take that $200 back to $1000, you would need 500% gains in a comparable amount of time as it would take for your original security to recover. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no chance that the original security will recover fully!\u201d Fucking wrong. Unless it\u2019s Luckin Coffee or some other radioactive dogshit, we\u2019ve seen time and again that stocks are only gonna go straight fuckin up for the next infinity years. Long after humans are gone algos are gonna be trading the last securities back and forth with digital money. \n\n\u201cThis is WSB, options or ban.\u201d Someone rack this faggot. I\u2019ve been on WSB for years and shares have always been part of the play. Especially right now, with IV insanely high, option premiums are through the roof and nothing is moving the way you expect it to. Buy shares in something with a low RSI, wait till it pops, and sell that shit. If it goes down, pretend its fucking bitcoin and hold it. \n\n If you wanna bitch and moan about only making 30% on a play, go to your all-time record on Robinhood and remind yourself that you\u2019re down 94% all time and you would suck a bleeding hobo dick for 10% gains. Take your favorite lipstick and write \u201cYOU ARE NOT FUCKING SMART ENOUGH FOR A TEN BAGGER\u201d on your mirror until you learn to walk away from the table with 15% in a week. \n\n\nTL;DR buy shares, hold them till they go up, sell them, repeat. If they don\u2019t go up, don\u2019t fucking sell them, and maybe your kids will sell for a gain. \n\nPositions: STNG, DHT, GLOG, UIS, INFY, MPLX.",

        "selftext": "To open I will make a bold claim, the rumors are true. Why do I think so, because that\u2019s a pre-requirement for what follows to make sense. You can call me insane, idgaf. \n\nSomeone knows the above and has orchestrated a massive scheme to profit on this fact. We\u2019ll call them whales. \n\nWhales started the buyout rumor in order to get the volume up. Nobody knows where this rumor started, MSFT using MVIS technology in their shit has been public knowledge for years. Probably pumped the stock a bit themselves, FOMO in full effect, then pumped it some more in extended hours using the fact that the volume is low, most stocks don\u2019t move much in extended hours mind you. If you look at the past few days majority of gains happened during extended hours. Let it run for a few days to further build up the volume. Pump again during extended hours, keep that FOMO going. This was Friday and Monday.\n\nThen came yesterday (Tuesday), normal start although the momentum started to fizzle down. Then came the stop raid. Why, a few reasons, get some cheap stocks, shake off a chunk of the weaker hands, get an estimate of how much you can really crash it, trigger an SSR breaker, and lower the confidence into the stock which in turn lowers the volume. Then just let it recover or pump it up a bit, you need less volume but you still need a lot of volume to pull this shit off.\n\nThis brings us into today (Wednesday), not much growth since yesterday, the momentum fizzled out but those who were holding were holding hoping to sell during late Wednesday or early Thursday or push their luck and sell before the call, few planned to actually brave the earnings report and conference call. None of us believed the rumor to be true. \n\nThen came the massive dip, courtesy of a fake news headline, bots/trolls spreading it around, and probably some good old fashioned market manipulation. \n\nThis brings us to accumulation. The chart behaved weird, frequently just trading in a 2 cent range for hours, like there were points where it broke out in either direction but it basically stayed in 1.08 to 1.10 range for a large chunk of the trading session. This brings us to the SSR breaker, once that\u2019s tripped for the rest of the trading day and the next day you can only place a short sale order at a higher price than the current price. So shorts had to play ball and sell for 1.10 or 1.09 when the price was at 1.08. A dip like that attracted a lot of shorts looking for a quick buck. The whales have eaten up all the short sales coming in and the weak hands getting out and are holding millions of shares. There was no recovery in the after hours today. Why, cause they don\u2019t need it. The minor spike in AH was probably some dumber shorts getting burned and having to cover.\n\nTomorrow (Thursday) the trading day is going to be a sideways slide with close to 0 net change, it\u2019s gonna look like the tail end of a one day runner after its done spiking, whoever was going to panic sell panic sold already. SSR breaker got tripped and volume is going to be in the gutter (buyers have no confidence in this bullshit anymore, shorts can\u2019t bring it down, whales have fed).\n\nAfter hours the rumors will be confirmed to true. Yes Microsoft or at least someone is buying, might be Facebook, might be Amazon, might be Tesla, might be someone else. Price will absolutely explode between the moment that\u2019s said and 8 PM. \n\nFriday, FOMO is again in full effect, everyone is chasing the stock, whales will either unload or just hold until buyout comes. Past Friday, who fucking cares, this is penny land after all.",

        "selftext": "Those DD posts all spammed yesterday. So much evidence the stock is going higher.\n\n-12% today.\n\nGreat work guys. DD is another way of saying \"I have no idea what I'm doing, so I'll rationalize why my trade will work.\" The mob of reddit upvotes it, because they're clueless, and now you got yourself a bunch of new bagholders.\n\nPerhaps it's a good thing these traders lose. Buying long on some of these companies, just downright stupid. \n\nStupid money is good. While it's sometimes painful to read the overwhelming amount of bullshit on this subreddit, every now and then something new comes along. Nowadays, we have the next hype stock posted daily. It's comical. \n\nHere's each point broken down:\n\n**Recklessly long-biased**\n-\n\n99.85% of all posts on here are long biased \"hot stock picks.\" I suspect many traders wouldn't be long if they had the choice. Unfortunately, robinhood and most mainstream brokers don't have the shares to borrow. So, instead of admitting it's impossible to profit long-term by swinging these pumps long, these traders double down. Like playing slots, they are always the losers, because they don't even know they are playing against the house.\n\n**Incompetent**\n-\n\nEver notice how each stock pick, those hype picks that you see on the front page, always fail? They always drop, even after a week. Those, like myself, who bring up the fact they fail, are met with usual replies:\n\n* You need to sell sooner rather than later\n\n* I bought before the pump even started\n\n* Gibberish about how the company is great\n\n* I'm a bad person for even suggesting the idea they'll fail\n\nNow all these vapid arguments all have one thing in common, the person has a vested interest in the stock. It's pretty amusing, because they create posts that are entirely emotion based. Some are more clever. Emotional based posts under the auspices of \"DD.\" I'll get to why this subreddits \"DD\" is nothing more than confirmation bias.\n\n**Shockingly uniformed**\n-\n\nNewbie traders, who admit they're new, should be given the benefit of the doubt. Although, newbies helping newbies create more newbie decisions, perhaps this is a bad cycle. While I can't prove it, sometimes there are manipulative forces that jump into subreddits like this. They mask themselves as \"arbiters of preforming proper DD.\" These people are nothing more than newsletter frauds, who have blended in to almost seem real. \n\nRead into astroturfing.\n\nEver notice how many DD posts contain a laundry list of reasons why a company is a good buy. Where is that short-biased DD? One side of the trade is correct, so perhaps there's more to it then \"microsoft may have a stake in it.\" Ironically, if you keep track of these hype stocks posted on here, all that DD is laughable. Re-read a few from a couple months ago. Check where those stocks ended up. \n\n**Never profitable long term**\n-\n\nOver the past 5 years, I've seen this subreddit grow into something pretty insane. A new stocktwits has formed. Pumpers, gullible sheep, and the occasional good trader make up the population on here. I remember posting similar things 5 years ago. These traders, who were confident in their positions at the time, would fire back at my contrarian arguments by saying my arguments are wrong. How many of these traders survived?\n\nNone.\n\nNone of those accounts, over 100 traders, survived.... except myself. I was short-biased, they were long-biased. Wave after wave, month after month, newbie traders are flushed out. Gullible traders, otherwise known as sheep, are the first ones to blow up. They are the slot machine players. The buyers into these hype stocks creating \"DD\" as a mask for their confirmation bias. \n\nCMV.",

        "selftext": " Alright autists and retards, everybody has been losing money on tankers this last week but I have news for you: your weak hands are the only reason you are losing money on tankers.\n\nIt may be a surprise to everyone under the age of 14 that the situation the tanker industry is in has happened twice in the past decade. There is a strong correlation between the oil contango and the market price of tanker stocks.\n\nAs you can see here from Euronav's investor update in April\n\n[https://imgur.com/UFgjZa5](https://imgur.com/UFgjZa5)\n\nNow that I have shown that the two are related let's take a look at the contango history:\n\n[https://imgur.com/e4Jwn76](https://imgur.com/e4Jwn76)\n\nLet's compare that to the stock price history of say STNG, NAT, ASC, FRO, and DHT:\n\n[https://imgur.com/iruMQGf](https://imgur.com/iruMQGf)\n\nIn 2008 and 2015 when the oil contango was at its highest (UNTIL NOW) these stocks were at 5-10 times what they are valued at now. It is important to note that the contango spike precedes the tanker stock price by about 6 months. But how is the contango rising compared to 2008? much faster and steadier ([https://imgur.com/oz4DplY](https://imgur.com/oz4DplY) ) What I am saying now is that these stocks are apollo 11 and you still have a chance to jump on the shuttle.\n\nLooking at earnings reports from STNG and DHT we see that they nearly made as much as the entire fiscal year of 2018 IN ONE QUARTER. No link cause I'm lazy and you people need to learn to do your own DD.\n\nSo everyone knows that the spot price is for these ships is up to as much as $110,000 (or at least you should know this because its over twice the standard rate and is RIDICULOUS) but what does that mean. Looking at ACG earnings report (I picked this one to show because its the most clear and easy to read) we can see \"Any increase in TCE goes fully to the bottom line, with every $10,000 / day increase in TCE adding approximately $90 million in earnings and cashflow annually.\"\n\nfrom ASC's highlights in the earnings report: [https://imgur.com/FNXyDMC](https://imgur.com/FNXyDMC)\n\nSo lets say they only are making $20,000 more per day per ship (its much more) and lets pick a small company like ACG that has a very small fleet of 20 tankers. That's a lot of tendies.\n\nWhat's the risk? U.S. tensions with the middle east could escalate and cut of transportation routes but I think this is very unlikely considering the pandemic.\n\nAre you worried COVID will bounce back and tank the economy so you don't want to invest? If that happens oil will go down again, storage will increase again and you will be drowning in so much cocaine and hookers you'll literally die.\n\nBuy the dip faggots.",

        "selftext": " I pasted [the article](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2020/05/07/the-market-v-the-real-economy), to exempt you from registering an account to read it.\n\n##Financial markets have got out of whack with the economy. Something has to give\n\nSTOCK MARKET HISTORY is packed with drama: the 1929 crash; Black Monday in 1987, when share prices lost 20% in a day; the dotcom mania in 1999. With such precedents, nothing should come as a surprise, but the past eight weeks have been remarkable, nonetheless. A gut-wrenching sell-off in shares has been followed by a delirious rally in America. Between February 19th and March 23rd, the S&amp;P 500 index lost a third of its value. With barely a pause it has since rocketed, recovering more than half its loss. The catalyst was news that the Federal Reserve would buy corporate bonds, helping big firms finance their debts. Investors shifted from panic to optimism without missing a beat.\n\nThis rosy view from Wall Street should make you uneasy (see article). It contrasts with markets elsewhere. Shares in Britain and continental Europe, for example, have recovered more sluggishly. And it is a world away from life on Main Street. Even as the lockdown eases in America, the blow to jobs has been savage, with unemployment rising from 4% to about 16%, the highest rate since records began in 1948. While big firms\u2019 shares soar and they get help from the Fed, small businesses are struggling to get cash from Uncle Sam.\n\nWounds from the financial crisis of 2007-09 are being reopened. \u201cThis is the second time we\u2019ve bailed their asses out,\u201d grumbled Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, last month. The battle over who pays for the fiscal burdens of the pandemic is just beginning. On the present trajectory, a backlash against big business is likely.\n\nStart with events in the markets. Much of the improved mood is because of the Fed, which has acted more dramatically than other central banks, buying up assets on an unimagined scale. It is committed to purchasing even more corporate debt, including high-yield \u201cjunk\u201d bonds. The market for new issues of corporate bonds, which froze in February, has reopened in spectacular style. Companies have issued $560bn of bonds in the past six weeks, double the normal level. Even beached cruise-line firms have been able to raise cash, albeit at a high price. A cascade of bankruptcies at big firms has been forestalled. The central bank has, in effect, backstopped the cashflow of America Inc. The stockmarket has taken the hint and climbed.\n\nThe Fed has little choice\u2014a run on the corporate-bond market would worsen a deep recession. Investors have cheered it on by piling into shares. They have nowhere else good to put their cash. Government-bond yields are barely positive in America. They are negative in Japan and much of Europe. You are guaranteed to lose money by holding them to maturity, and if inflation rises the losses would be painful. So stocks are appealing. By late March prices had fallen by enough to tempt the braver sort. They steeled themselves with the observation that much of the stockmarket\u2019s value is tied to profits that will be made long after the covid-19 slump has given way to recovery.\n\nTellingly, though, the recent rise in share prices has been uneven. Even before the pandemic the market was lopsided, and it has become more so. Bourses in Britain and continental Europe, chock-full of troubled industries like carmaking, banking and energy, have lagged behind, and there are renewed jitters over the single currency (see article). In America investors have put even more faith in a tiny group of tech darlings\u2014Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft\u2014which now make up a fifth of the S&amp;P 500 index. There is little euphoria, just a despairing reach for the handful of businesses judged to be all-weather survivors.\n\nAt one level, this makes good sense. Asset managers have to put money to work as best they can. But there is something wrong with how fast stock prices have moved and where they have got back to. American shares are now higher than they were in August. This would seem to imply that commerce and the broader economy can get back to business as usual. There are countless threats to such a prospect, but three stand out.\n\nThe first is the risk of an aftershock. It is entirely possible that there will be a second wave of infections. And there are also the consequences of a steep recession to contend with\u2014American GDP is expected to drop by about 10% in the second quarter compared with a year earlier. Many individual bosses hope that ruthless cost-cutting can help protect their margins and pay down the debts accumulated through the furlough. But in aggregate this corporate austerity will depress demand. The likely outcome is a 90% economy, running far below normal levels.\n\nA second hazard to reckon with is fraud. Extended booms tend to encourage shifty behaviour, and the expansion before the covid crash was the longest on record. Years of cheap money and financial engineering mean that accounting shenanigans may now be laid bare. Already there have been two notable scandals in Asia in recent weeks, at Luckin Coffee, a Chinese Starbucks wannabe, and Hin Leong, a Singaporean energy trader that has been hiding giant losses (see article). A big fraud or corporate collapse in America could rock the markets\u2019 confidence, much as the demise of Enron shredded investors\u2019 nerves in 2001 and Lehman Brothers led the stockmarket down in 2008.\n\nThe most overlooked risk is of a political backlash. The slump will hurt smaller firms and leave the bigger corporate survivors in a stronger position, increasing the concentration of some industries that was already a problem before the pandemic. A crisis demands sacrifice and will leave behind a big bill. The clamour for payback will only grow louder if big business has hogged more than its share of the subsidies on offer. It is easy to imagine windfall taxes on bailed-out industries, or a sharp reversal of the steady drop in the statutory federal corporate-tax rate, which fell to 21% in 2017 after President Donald Trump\u2019s tax reforms, from a long-term average of well over 30%. Some Democrats want to limit mergers and stop firms returning cash to their owners.\n\nFor now, equity investors judge that the Fed has their back. But the mood of the markets can shift suddenly, as an extraordinary couple of months has proved. A one-month bear market scarcely seems enough time to absorb all the possible bad news from the pandemic and the huge uncertainty it has created. This stock market drama has a few more acts yet.\u25a0",

Who doesn't want that? Well if you do I have the play for you! First let's catch you up to speed on this 2 week old post, which if you would have followed me, you to would be enjoying over 800% gains at this point.\n\n[Original DD Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7ifvr/cornerstone_ondemand_csdo_dd_undervalued_gem_in_a/)\n\n**but wait there's more!**\n\n&gt; Private reports of the SABA acquisition in relation to CSOD's overall revenue forecast a 25-33% increase, this will officially be detailed in Q1 earnings report.\n\n&gt; SABA has a very large clientele base which is apt for cross-selling $CSOD's exisiting products\n\n&gt; CSOD is mostly institutional buys. They are looking for safe-havens in this risky environment, $CSOD has a HUGE cash flow. Cash is king in a recession. They are also primarily catering to essential employees, their cash flow will not be as affected. SABA acquisition also represents a large percentage increase in free cash flow.\n\n&gt; CSOD already has most of its annualized returns locked in due to contracts and will be able to provide stable, if not forward-looking guidance.\n\n&gt; [Please see this additional comment DD, holy fucking shit just buy calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7ifvr/cornerstone_ondemand_csdo_dd_undervalued_gem_in_a/folrklv/)\n\nSo what we have here is a undervalued, heavily hit company during the crash which has yet to make it's checkmark recovery like so many other stocks. What's difference?\n\nWell people are now finally realizing how strong the tech sector is, and how valuable remotely-engaged businesses will be in the future. This pandemic just caused a paradigm shift in how humans will work in the future, companies like $CSOD will profit from this immensely in the next 2-4 quarters which investors will EAT UP.\n\nNow let me answer some questions that I frequently see...\n\n&gt; *hurr durrr I saw the executives selling shares?* well yeah no shit, they were about to announce an acquisition which usually tanks share prices short-term. The next time they sold was the actual market crash, who wouldn't?\n\n&gt; *but what if this is another NET?* $CSOD is still significantly down from its share price before the crash and acquisition. Once we see how the new acquisition will help CSOD in the medium-term, institutions will be eating this stock up for its MASSIVE FREE CASH FLOW. Also this is mostly institutional buyers, this ain't a meme stock (except now it is...)\n\n&gt; *how are you sure they beat?* if you take a look at the current expectations for Q1, they are relatively low in a quarter where all of America, and the World was sent into lockdown resulting in a MASSIVE shift to online-based learning, trainings and work.

I will be remaining in a $5k-$7.5k long-term play for earnings. Literally I bet my savings on this shit.\n\nI am glad my first $DD has been so profitable for so many, and I hope it continues to pay y'all out, it sure has for me. I can't wait to see what is in store on Monday night. What's next? Find out this weekend on another edition of Baked Morning.\n\nGood luck, and may your portfolio finally go green.\n\nTLDR: avoid IV, stick with June 19 $37.50c / $40c / $42.50c as many as you can buy.",

        "selftext": "\nNew wave of players in this market, and a new wave of stupidity. With stupidity comes those who are without morals, and will trick you into believing nonsense. They will gladly take your money if you handed it to them. \n\nNew promoters pop up all the time. Sometimes with fancy indicators. Sometimes with \"well constructed DD.\" Sometimes they simply promote themselves as being fantastic traders. \n\nSome of us, who've been on this subreddit long enough, have seen these promoters come and go. Users like CaptainWeee, who was a glorified pump and dump artist, Tuffadams, etc. All scam artists. You'll even notice comments of sheep DEFENDING these charlatans. These commenters all no longer trade. If you defend these scam artists, you'll be on the wrong side of history.\n\nThe new nonsense is a no-name stocktwit user. We will call him scammer salm. Scammer salm fancies himself as a great trader. He frequently posts on alt accounts to push his own stock picks. This is known as astroturfing in the political realm. \n\nWhere did he come from? Why are there redditors RAVING about his picks? Do his picks work? All these questions will be answered in the piece below.\n\n**Where did he come from?**\n-\n\nMost promoters do the exact same things. They sell a service or promote a stock. They use alternate accounts to push their posts. They don't just \"spawn\" out of no where. They don't gain traction naturally. In fact, Scammy Salm is yet another pump and dump artist, using the same tricks that anyone could do. Buying upvotes, using alternative accounts, and giving a false perception of what's truly the case. Like the idea you can be profitable by following his callouts. Some promoters are more cleaver. Intentionally create controversy about their stock pick. That's smart, because it baits in more clicks and buyers. None of these traders who \"buy early on the pumps\" survive. Never.\n\n**Why are there redditors RAVING about his picks?**\n-\n\nIt's a trick. Some are genuinely invested in his picks. Sorry to say, these are the sheep that'll took the bait hook line and sinker. Most aren't raving. Most are actually him. His posts. His upvotes. His promotion.\n\nScammer salm creates a false perception by pushing his own material through manipulative means. This is what others on here have done. It's nothing new. In fact, you can find tons of evidence on older 2000s message boards. See the promoters job is to promote. They know they can make money by convincing as many people as possible. Before the contrarians fire back and say that's what I'm doing, I have no financial incentive. \n\n**Do his picks work?**\n-\n\nStudy history. Not only have promoters, and the sheep following them, all failed off, but they've created the next wave. The next wave of people who're just as gullible. I can't comment on the longevity of following a promoters picks. Many people are fooled by survivorship bias. They're convinced that their 2 - 10 profitable trades will lead to longevity. It doesn't. It will fail given enough variables and time.\n\nThese stocktwit screenshots and other promotions aren't spawning randomly. I think many are beginning to question why the moderators approved of image posting. Couldn't they see it was bound to be subject to manipulation? Probably. Perhaps shorting these posters is a better and more reliable method of profiting then doing \"DD\" on a long.\n\nIf you follow someones stock picks once, and it works, great! The more you follow their picks, the lower your account value will fall. \n\nYou can, however, profit by figuring out who the house is. \n\nThat's your edge.\n\nI've never touched, long or short, any of these promoters picks (including scammer salm).\n\nBest of luck.\n\n\n\n**Sources:**\n-\n\n* [Survivorship Bias](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/survivorshipbias.asp)\n* [Good read about pump and dump artists](https://investorshub.advfn.com/Dump-The-Pump-9311/)",

        "selftext": "Warren Buffett made headlines recently after his recent [virtual Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69rm13iUUgE).\n\nBuffett sold of all his shares in the major US airlines, and Berkshire announced a record quarterly net loss of nearly $50BN. Berkshire *had* held sizeable positions (around 10%) in the major US airlines.\n\nAs well as this, Buffett also allowed Berkshire's cash stake to rise to a record $137.3BN from $128BN at the end of 2019.\n\nClearly, as he is selling at a significant loss, Buffett believes that there is further pain ahead for the airlines. \n\nThe GOAT is not one to fall for the sunk cost fallacy...\n\nMoreover, his cash position indicates that he doesn't believe that we have reached the stock market bottom yet, although he wouldn't give specifics.\n\nOthers however are more explicitly bearish.\n\nThe numbers are certainly [not looking good](https://fortune.com/2020/03/20/recession-us-gdp-negative-growth-q2-predictions/)...\n\n**TRUTH 1/2:**\n\n[1640 CEOs left their posts in 2019](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/07/2019-had-the-most-ceo-departures-on-record-with-more-than-1600.html), the highest year on record since tracking began in 2002.\n\nFor context, there were 1484 exits in *2008* when the country was embroiled in the financial crisis.\n\nThis trend has continued in 2020, [in January a record 219 CEOs left their posts](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/12/rapid-ceo-turnover-continues-with-a-record-number-of-top-executives-departing-in-january.html), the highest month on record.\n\nThe economy was going to crash anyway. It was inevitable.\n\nHowever, they were afraid of massive protests against corporate greed, massive social unrest, etc so they needed a diversion that would provide an excuse.\n\nPeople will think the crash was solely due to the virus and not the numerous fundamental economic and structural issues at play.\n\nTo highlight just a few: we've had the [yield curve inversion](https://www.businessinsider.de/international/yield-curve-inversion-explained-what-it-is-what-it-means-2019-8/?r=US&amp;IR=T), the [repo madness](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-08/repo-blowup-was-fueled-by-big-banks-and-hedge-funds-bis-says), the [record corporate debt](https://www.businessinsider.de/international/us-corporate-debt-10-trillion-record-percentage-economy-expert-warnings-2019-12/?r=US&amp;IR=T), and [corporations being the main source of demand for equities via stock buybacks](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/business/stock-market-buybacks.html) which enrich executives that hit certain earnings per share targets.\n\nLast year billionaire Peter Thiel, who was part of the notorious Paypal Mafia, [spoke on the dangers of American Exceptionalism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JRyy2MM-rI). He argues that this has made America \"exceptionally un-self-critical\"\n\nWarren Buffett concluded in his virtual meeting: \"Never bet against America\"\n\nIn other words, never bet against the military industrial complex to enforce American superiority and the power of the dollar as the de facto unit of exchange globally.\n\n**TRUTH 2/2:**\n\nAs smart contracts pioneer Nick Szabo has stated:\n\n\"Buffett's wealth can be measured less in present cash than in the future cash from the Fed he is right up there at the front of the Cantillon line to get.\"\n\n[The Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs) essentially refers to the fact that fiat printing itself increases inequality. \n\nOn a more general note, it is important to remember that, despite his gentle image, Buffett is ruthless in his craft. \n\nA [New York magazine profile from 1991](https://books.google.de/books?id=veTPZA9TWxsC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=1991+new+york+magazine+warren+buffett+Warren+looks+like+a+teddy+bear,+but+mentally+is+he+ever+tough&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OT8xAOp_-y&amp;sig=ACfU3U2s1_9PvAvkaw4w5BSh0l1KgG1yhA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjtvP2__ZzpAhUG3aQKHfcYA1kQ6AEwFXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=1991%20new%20york%20magazine%20warren%20buffett%20Warren%20looks%20like%20a%20teddy%20bear%2C%20but%20mentally%20is%20he%20ever%20tough&amp;f=false) stated: \n\n\"Though he appears homey and guileless and cultivates a hayseed image, Buffett can be iron-fisted.\"\n\nAccording to a senior Salomon trader: \"Warren looks like a teddy bear, but mentally is he ever tough.\"\n\nYes, Buffett has dropped numerous gems throughout the years, but ultimately his responsibility is to Berkshire Hathaway and his own, sizeable, bags.\n\nOverall, it would be foolish to overlook Buffett's current cash position.\n\nWhen everything is dirt cheap and we do eventually hit the bottom, he will be flush with cash and ready to aggressively sweep up bargains. \n\nAt the moment, it is clear that he believes these bargains are not present, and therefore it would be wise to consider the fact that we may have further downside in store...\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsAfJMNtxsU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsAfJMNtxsU)",

We\u2019ve since seen these stocks appreciate considerably. \n\nI again [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2zhb0/taking_stock_of_tanker_stocks/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) about tanker stocks again two weeks ago encouraging many of you to hold these stocks for longer than your usual holding period of two minutes. Many of you couldn\u2019t resist the urge to take profit in advance of earnings. \n\nThat was a mistake. \n\nEarnings is the catalyst that will drive these companies higher. It\u2019s when management will reveal not only the extent to which they\u2019ve already captured outsized profits on elevated day rates but also when they will guide the market on 2Q and 3Q earnings based on the date rates they\u2019re currently contracted on. I happen to have access to that data, and those contracts happen to be at very high rates. In short, street estimates of earnings are still way too low. \n\nIn my last post I made it clear that street analysts have been too conservative in raising their earnings estimates on tanker stocks. Finally today we have Jefferies analyst raising his PTs and estimates across every tanker stock in his coverage. Just before earnings, of course.\n\nDHT PT raised from $8 to $9, 2020 EPS raised from $2.20 to $2.89.\n\nEURN PT raised from $13 to $15, 2020 EPs raised from $2.66 to $3.89.\n\nFRO PT raised from $10 to $12, 2020 EPS raised from $2.82 to $3.87\n\nTNP PT raised from $5 to $5.50, 2020 EPS raised from $1.50 to $2.13\n\nSTNG PT raised from $30 to $32, 2020 EPS raised from $6.04 to $10.59.\n\nMy plan is to hold through 2Q earnings release, but I do expect this week to be a major week for tankers with multiple names reporting. Specifically, on the calendar this week we got DHT releasing tomorrow (5/5), then STNG (5/6) and EURN (5/7). Should be wild. LFG!",

I show our net, our cash and Treasury bill position on March 31st. And you might look at that and say, \u201cWell, you\u2019ve got $125 billion or so in cash and Treasury bills.

Suburbs have been using development fees to fund maintenance in already existing communities.  Not a bit, totally.  The maintenance in any existing community is \\*totally\\* funded by development fees in new communities.  New developments will build the infrastructure for which the city will then be liable, and they intend to repair and maintain that infrastructure with development fees in the future.  Suburban communities are straight up incapable of paying for themselves, the cost in infrastructure maintenance absolutely dwarfs what they can bring in with property taxes.  If you ever wondered why the property taxes in New Jersey are so punishing, this is why.  It's an entire state of property owners, expensive infrastructure, and no businesses to tax.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuburbs absolutely cannot survive any kind of cessation of development, and long term, they cannot survive at all.

        "selftext": "Daily overview heading into the US open. The US options market opens in about 2 hours from now. Futures are up. [Prices trade on resistance](https://www.reddit.com/user/2020sbear/comments/gehuxi/were_now_back_to_2890_spx/). Our outlook for the day is bearish.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day opportunity rank: 1**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExpected opening action:\n\nSPX is trading 2890 in the futures market.  Prices making a double top in this area would signal a  downtrend through the day most likely.  I expect to see the market continue to  fall in the coming couple of hours and the US open  to be lower than the current price.  My estimate  at this point is a  low around 2865 - 2860.\n\nIf we see prices falling a bit in futures and then breaking under this level our best bet for the day is probably going to be found around the retest of the 2880 area. Here we can buy puts and use moderate strikes  of 2865 - 2860 or aggressive strikes of 2845.  This is a level where I want to take daily, weekly and monthly options.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Risk assessment of the day;**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBullish risk:\n\nTo gain any sort of control over the market the bulls have to be able to take the 2890 area.  Above the 2899 level the bulls could have a firmer grip on the market until at lest 2910.  All risk today should be confined to under the 2890 level.  2899 is the stop loss level on the day.  As the market trades right now, I think the bull risk is low,  and lower still if we fall to  2865 sort of level.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRange risk:\n\nI think  today has a very low probability of being a ranging day. I do think the market can range for a while around the 2890 price point, and I'd not expect to see this for more than 8 - 9 hours. We've been there around 6 hours now and I think (at least one way or the other) a break of the range is due and a trending day will follow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think it is very likely some sort of news that will start to make the market very volatile is due some time in the coming days or week ahead. Today we have a big opportunity to position ourselves for this. Taking quite a low  risk entry that we can cut loss on quickly if need be, and get in to the trades before the premiums rocket.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n\\----\n\nOptions trading can be very profitable but is also something that can have a lot of (especially short-term) variance. To trade options without any losses is impossible and even profitable options trading strategies are going to experience some runs of losing trades. Here are some risk awareness points anyone considering options trades based upon ideas and information posted here;\n\nDaily options 3 times rule:\n\nDaily options can produce either reasonable or exceptional gains in a small period of time. The right option on the right day is worth a fortune, but these are also the trades most likely to produce losses. When taking daily options it's best to adopt a mindset of being willing to lose the option on three attempts if required. That's not to say risk everything over three bets, it's to say bet an amount you can lose 3 times and still be fine to take other trades later.\n\nOpportunity Ranks;\n\nThere is always the option to trade, but the best opportunities to trade come along far more infrequently. Many days and weeks or trading will not present extremely high probability options trades. Using smaller bets during times when the market is offering lower odds (which is most of the time) allows for the riding of more ups and downs in losses while waiting for clearer opportunities. At times when more things line up to support the trade, it makes more sense to bet bigger on these. These are rarer opportunities.\n\nMarket conditions will be ranked as being low (3), medium (2) or high (1) probability. High probability rankings do not remove the requirement or usefulness of the three times rule. Often a big move is going to happen, but getting it on the nose first time is difficult. Hedging and Protecting Positions; It is best to ensure there is capital available to place hedge trades against options you have open if required. This should be considered before opening any trades.\n\nEverything here's educational only. You have to make your own decisions",

Are they just gonna hold this dogshit on their books until the end of time?  What about all the junk bonds and ETFs BlackRock has been buying up?  Where do these go?  In an ideal world, they would slowly be introduced back into the market once the market is \"standing on it's own\" again, whatever the fuck that means. \n\nExcept I don't think this is possible.

By then, the balance sheet will be around 10-12 trillion and rates will be a 25 bps negative.  At this point, the Fed will *actually be out of ammo*.

        "selftext": "# tl; dr\n\nSeriously, just go away.  If you can't be bothered to read for 5 minutes before putting money on something, you don't belong here.   You're not an autist; you're just a full blown retard.\n\nWhat you should do first is go read the post where I called the price of the stock pre-earnings and as a great [COVID Recovery Play: PRPL to $12-$14 by 5/12 and $20-$24 by end of Q1 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g30vst/covid_recovery_play_prpl_to_1214_by_512_and_2024/)**.**\n\nAfter that, you need to go read how I predicted the beat on earnings consensus over the weekend here:   [Purple (PRPL) Earnings is Monday After Hours: Here's What to Expect](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ggp2vx/purple_prpl_earnings_is_monday_after_hours_heres/)**.**\n\nOnly after reading and understanding those two things will you be capable of making tendies as described below because you will actually know what you are doing.\n\nIf I've already exceeded your maximum word count, go back to reading the memes on the sub so you can cool your overheated brain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote:  all quotes below are paraphrased from the earnings call.  I am not transcribing that thing.\n\n# 2020 Q1 Earnings Release\n\nEarnings could not have gone better.  PRPL is literally a brand new business that should catch your eye for investment.  I am solidly in the $19+ camp [from my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ggp2vx/purple_prpl_earnings_is_monday_after_hours_heres/) based upon results and the guidance given.   You can still make tendies on this play because PRPL builds its price action over time, which I will cover below.   Let's look at some numbers first.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n||Consensus|Actuals|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Revenue|$106.97M|$122.4M|\n|EPS|$0.05|$0.11|\n\nA solid beat on Revenue, EPS, EBITDA and Adj. EBITDA.   Just an amazing quarter, but the historical isn't the best part.   The forward looking is ***amazing***.  Before we get into that, a few more numbers that matter.\n\n**Receivables**\n\nPRPL has a large wholesale business which means it has significant exposure to bad debts due to retail brick and mortar locations closing and retailers who are obviously cash starved.   Joe told us on the call  that their wholesale accounts are \"largely current on their receivables\" and Purple is \"continuing to get paid almost entirely across the board\".\n\nAwesome.  This means very little bad debt and the revenue earned will convert to cash.\n\n**Warrant Liability Accrual**\n\nYeah, I called this one.   It was material to the shift in EPS, but you are an idiot if you care.   This stuff is equity and should be treated as equity.   Yes, GAAP requires otherwise, but the FASB doesn't always make the best decisions.\n\n**Supply Chain**\n\n&gt;Our supply chain has not as yet been significantly affected by COVID-19. Currently, our domestic suppliers are able to continue operations and provide necessary materials when needed. Suppliers in China were temporarily closed as a result of the pandemic but we had sufficient inventory on hand. Many of our suppliers resumed production in March and are able to supply materials as needed. As a result, we don\u2019t expect supply to have a material impact on our ability to meet anticipated demand.\n\nThere you have it.  Pretty much no supply chain risk.\n\n# Forward Looking Guidance\n\nPRPL did not provide formal guidance for the rest of the year, but the rest of the year is what they mostly talked about on the call, and the management team clearly wanted you to understand April with their \"[Second Quarter Preview](https://investors.purple.com/press-releases/news-details/2020/Purple-Innovation-Reports-Record-First-Quarter-2020-Results/default.aspx)\".  Let's look at what they said.\n\n**Cash**\n\nThey ended Q1 with $26.4M in cash (down from Q4's $33.5M in cash); however, **they ended April with $62.5M in cash**!  Management really wanted to call it out so they put the April cash number at the top with all of the Q1 numbers on the earnings release, which I thought was funny.  In reality, they've done a fantastic job at managing expenses and converting inventory on hand into cash during the quarter.   This should give you quite a bit of confidence in the management team.  This is probably more cash on hand than they have ever had, which means they are well weathered to not just manage this storm (which is a storm that is cash flow positive for them), but to invest ahead of the competition for the future.\n\n**Hiring and Capacity**\n\nJoe confirmed that \"the furlough is all but over\" and Purple is \"actually in hiring mode right now to bring people in fairly aggressively\" in order to expand capacity.   According to Joe, \"***demand has not waned at all***\".  Purple is still selling very near capacity (they brought a new machine online and are expanding their hiring aggressively to fill the capacity).\n\nPRPL announced previously, as a result of COVID, that they were deferring all capital expenditures.They've now done a 180 on that statement.  PRPL is accelerating the completion of the Max 7 machine in order to increase capacity another 20% over last year, which should be done this quarter.  The Max 8 &amp; 9 machines are still happening, but because they are being built in their new east coast manufacturing facility, it is unknown whether they will get them done this year.\n\nIf you have been paying attention to my previous posts, you will remember that ***the Max 8 &amp; 9 machines were not necessary to meet the pre-COVID guidance*** provided for the year.  This is part of why ***PRPL is going to beat their original pre-COVID guidance this year***.  Read on.\n\n**Wholesale Sales**\n\nWholesale is down dramatically.  Duh.  85% of wholesale doors were closed during April, but they have seen through April that sequential wholesale orders have been increasing.   **Believe it or not, we are happy for wholesale to stay closed longer for PRPL.**   What!?!   Yep.  We'll get into that more in a second, but let's talk about the hedge to revenue that wholesale provides.\n\nI strongly inferred in a previously post that PRPL can simply expand wholesale doors to make up for lost same store sells.   Joe just came out and said it on the call:  if wholesale sales are slow to recover on a same store basis, the could just expand to more doors.\n\nAdditionally, their wholesale partners burned through their safety stock of Purple mattresses.  As wholesale doors are opening up, large orders are coming in to restock their inventory.  The trend for wholesale remains to be seen as doors reopen and Memorial Day weekend comes in.  Wholesale doors are achieving up to 85% of demand at most right now and this is a good thing.\n\nThis means our worst case scenario is that PRPL will meet their pre-COVID guidance for the year by simply expanding wholesale doors.  The hedge.\n\n**Direct to Consumer Sales**\n\nTHIS is why PRPL is going to BEAT their pre-COVID guidance for the year.  I'm calling it now.\n\nApril DTC sales were up 170% YoY for the full month.   170%!!!  Not only that, Joe explained that:\n\n&gt;It has been remarkebly consistent.   Briefly saw DTC retract at the end of March.  PRPL saw pretty consistent DTC performance at the beginning of April, but a retraction in wholesale as stores shut down.  ***About the time the stimulus checks hit, we saw a pretty significant increase in our DTC business***\\*\\*.\\*\\*   We did some surveying and we don't think its entirely related to the stimulus checks themselves, but really some sentiment and people settle into the new normal. Since that time, ***we've seen a consistent but eleveated performance on DTC***.  It has really be pretty remarkable on how consistent it has been.\n\nThis means the run rate exiting April was greater than 170% YoY for DTC (if the average of 170% includes half the month at a lower rate).   Joe told us that this is more than offsetting the decline in wholesale.\n\nPRPL will beat pre-COVID guidance for the quarter and for the year because:\n\n* They have a new Mattress Max machine as of the beginning of the quarter (20% increase over last year's unit manufacturing capacity)\n* They are still selling everything they can make.\n* They receive greater revenue and margin from every DTC unit relative to wholesale.\n\nTherefore, we will see a revenue and earnings beat for the next quarter and likely the rest of the year.\n\nPRPL management believes that unit demand never disappeared and that they've seen a shift of demand from their brick and mortar partners to online (which means PRPL makes more money per mattress).\n\nAdditionally, they've seen a decline in marketing acquisition costs as many competitors are struggling and overall advertising costs are dropping nationwide.  The acquistion model online is much more simple than attempting to spend to get people to go into stores (for anyone who understands modern digital marketing, these means they will be able to scale their spend and revenue justifiably easier and faster).  New customers as a % of all customers (in terms of traffic and purchases) has gone up as they have been able to cast a wider net digitally and had a higher conversion rate.\n\nJoe's words about the boost in revenue caused by the shift to DTC are:  \"it is distorting revenue up\".   Joe, this is going to distort the stock price up too.\n\nLastly, Joe stated very clearly their plans for wholesale reopening offsetting DTC revenue in their manufacturing constrained world:  \"they would throttle their wholesale growth until they could continue to expand their capacity\".  DTC for the win!\n\n**A slow return to normal will benefit Purple by boosting per unit revenue and margin.**\n\nLike I said, this is a brand new business.\n\n# Forward Looking Price Action - More Tendies!\n\nThere are still opportunities to make tendies with PRPL tomorrow and over the next quarter.  Here is why.\n\n**PRPL Builds Price Momentum**\n\nBecause PRPL is a mid-market stock with not a lot of following and mid-market volume, its price actions are not immediate.  The typical pattern after earnings is that the price adjustment builds slowly over the next day to whatever direction earnings dictates.   Then, the price action continues to build over the next quarter.  Look at the price action after the Q3 2019 earnings call if you want the most pronounced example of this.\n\nWherever we start tomorrow, I'll bet money that we end much higher.\n\n**PRPLW Lag**\n\nPRPLW warrants do not behave like your typical CBOE options where market makers have algorithms changing the bid/ask on every strike with every movement of the stock.   Typical market makers accept those prices at every level because they are delta hedging with your play.\n\nPRPLW warrants are OTC and there is no options chain currently, which means not a whole lot of market making.   While this makes them less liquid, it also means that PRPLW warrants typically lag the price of PRPL stock on the way up as you are trading against other people.   Plenty of scalping opportunities on big price movement days if you know what you are doing.   If you don't know, it means you can usually get a good deal if you buy into a longer-term hold.\n\n**Short Interest**\n\nSHORT INTEREST INCREASED!!!  The 4/30 numbers are out tonight and short interest increased a whopping 33.5%!   That means we have a short float of 10.72%.\n\nIf you recall my weekend post,  only 16.44% of float is left with non-institutionals.   Those 2,439,121 short shares are going to get squeezed.   The shorts got hurt today with ER and they are going to want to slowly exit their position over the next day or so, which is another reason why we may see momentum in the stock tomorrow.   If there is a push behind it, we may see a much more dramatic squeeze.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yqo6ilxgv8y41.png?width=791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6bcdb6ded74c2d3281d7a98717e11aad72e17975\n\nWe still saw a significant amount of short volume through today.  As the stock gaps up, margin calls are going to happen.   As shorts cover and new buyers buy in, this will accelerate.   Depending on your broker, margin calls could have days to cover, which means we will see upward pressure over a few days.\n\n**Press Coverage**\n\nPRPL is still not a well known stock.  It will likely get some better press coverage over the next few days for two reasons:\n\n1. It slaughtered earnings better than most companies this season.\n2. Casper, a media darling, reports tomorrow morning.\n\nIt is Casper's first earnings release since IPOing.   Whether or not it is a disaster, most reporters will start drawing comparisons to PRPL.   More visibility through the day tomorrow and weeks to come will drive further new investment as people start to understand what is happening here.\n\n**Index Additions**\n\nPRPL gapping up and growing will only increase the number of indexes it gets added to and therefore funds that are required to buy in.   More cash investment required over the next few months will only support a growing stock price.\n\n**Great Fundamentals**\n\nLastly, this stock had great fundamentals before this huge earnings beat, and fundamentals always win in the long run.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck tomorrow and let's get some tendies!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Positions\n\nI have one share of PRPL.   I made $2 on it today and am up $1.91 since open.   In great wsb tradition, I'll probably do a gain post on that.\n\nThe PRPLW warrant prices don't update AH.   That's where I ended the day.   I had a steak dinner tonight to celebrate.   The wife tried to give me a chicken salad from Panera, but I wasn't having it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p8xftnpzz8y41.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=005bd6c3156a79eeab3d4ec007858cb6efb94c73",

        "selftext": "(Bloomberg) -- Air Canada said it expects the impact of the pandemic to last at least three years and predicted large job cuts as it hunkers down to survive \u201cthe darkest period ever\u201d for the industry.\n\nThe country\u2019s biggest airline, which on Monday reported a first-quarter loss, said it expects capacity in the third quarter to be 75% below last year\u2019s level, from a 85-90% drop in the current quarter. It is accelerating plans to retire 79 planes and continues to look for ways to reduce costs and boost liquidity, it said.\n\n\u201cWe expect that both the overall industry and our airline will be considerably smaller for some time, which will unfortunately result in significant reductions in both fleet and employee levels,\u201d Chief Executive Calin Rovinescu said in a statement. He described the situation as \u201cthe darkest period ever in the history of commercial aviation.\u201d\n\nAir Canada\u2019s \u201cdetermination is to ensure that our company is positioned to emerge in the post-Covid-19 world as strong as possible and capitalize on the opportunities that will inevitably arise,\u201d he said.\n\nIn contrast to major competitors around the world, Canadian airlines haven\u2019t yet received industry-specific support from the government. So far Air Canada has said it will use a 75% wage subsidy to keep or recall most of the 36,000 employees in Canada who were furloughed.\n\nFor the first quarter, Air Canada reported a loss of C$1.05 billion ($745 million) compared to a profit of C$345 million last year. On an adjusted basis, the loss was C$392 million versus a profit of C$17 million last year.\n\n\nhttps://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/air-canada-sees-pandemic-impact-lasting-at-least-three-years-1.1431037",

        "selftext": "Welcome back to the WSB DD Summary! This is for 5/2-5/4. I\u2019m your host and resident autist u/expander2. You have to be able to read to gain anything from this so that rules out about half of you. As always, ticker is in bold on the left and what I deem \"important\" is near the top of the post. A TLDR, plays, and previous DD summaries will be at the bottom. My last posts still stand and hold some good info so check it out for more plays if this isn't enough for you greedy fucks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst things first. Remember that we are reading *Money; A Suicide Note* for the [WSB Books event](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g85inu/wsbooks_vol_1_money_a_suicide_note_4pm_et_516/). It can be bought (which is recommended) or [downloaded here](https://epdf.pub/money-a-suicide-note129e7b0df400a345810ae585631783a94603.html). It will download as a LIT file then upload it to [this site](https://anyconv.com/lit-to-pdf-converter/) and re-download as a PDF. This event is aimed at making everyone a better trader and having a little autistic fun at the same time.  Now for the DD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Z;**  Let's take a look at Zillow. They are an interesting company. This is an excerpt straight from their website;\n\n&gt;Zillow serves the full lifecycle of owning and living in a home: buying, selling, renting, financing, remodeling and more. It starts with Zillow's living database of more than 110 million U.S. homes - including homes for sale, homes for rent and homes not currently on the market\n\nThey are a big business raking in $2.7 billion in 2019. However, looking at [their 10-K](https://last10k.com/sec-filings/z#link_fullReport) from that same year shows a $300 million loss which is up about $180 million from 2018. That's not good. They are consistently spending much more than they bring in but somehow are still seen as a good company. Their debt also rose in 2019 from about $700 million in long term debt to a whopping $1.5 BILLION. All these numbers are straight from their 10-K (Feel free to thank me and thank u/fuzzyblankeet too for teaching me how to understand this shit). At the end of 2019 they had 2,707 homes in their inventory. \n\nNow you ask, \u201cWhat do we do with all these big numbers that I don't understand?\u201d, and I say, \u201cYou just fucking look at them.\u201d So here is what we can take away from this. This is a company that is consistently losing money, has more than doubled their debt in a year, and much of their asset value comes from owning 2,707 houses. What happens to the price of homes in a recession? It fucking drops\u2026 like a lot. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gdbzyn/home_sales_to_fall_up_to_60/) goes over some basic stuff but more importantly it shows what they just released which is a statement saying it might take UNTIL 2021 TO RECOVER. Damn, that sucks. Earnings come out on 5/7 after close so puts for 5/15 because you can't sell options that expire that day. But more than that, this is a long term play too. Zillow will not do well in a recession and we haven't quite entered one yet. If you want, look far out for puts. Could be a smart thing especially given all this information.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Next Leg Down;** For another explanation on why we are rising in the midst of a pandemic, read this post or read the last few lines right here;\n\n&gt;This entire bull rally has been fueled by new retail investors buying the dip, bringing the stock price to euphoric levels. Over the past few weeks, we\u2019ve been seeing the people waiting at the sidelines for years to get into the stock market slowly FOMO into the rally in smaller and smaller volumes, while the smart money have been locking in their profits at an even slower rate - hence an ascending wedge. As the amount of new retail interest in the stock market started slowed down, the amount of new bulls started to decline. This doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ll instantly go back to circuit breakers, we might see 282 -&gt; 274 -&gt; 284 -&gt; 274 happen before panic, this time by the first-time investors, eventually bringing us down.\n\nI cut a couple things out so this isn't a direct quote but it's what you need to understand. Millions of first time investors are \u201cbuying the dip\u201d and when they stop doing this in such large numbers then the real gravity of the situation we are in will hit. It will be all Uh-oh\u2019s and fuck-me\u2019s from then till we hit the bottom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Oil Reminder;**  Oh and remember those tanker plays I recommended on the [4/9-4/13](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0nkrl/summary_of_dd_from_49413_insider_trading_oil/) post? Those fucking printed. So remember the [4/23-4/24](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7f1m6/dd_from_423424_live_nation_oil_starbucks_and/) post I made about land based oil storage? Those are going to print too so get in while you can. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Unusual Activity;** This isn't a big thing for me but it may help a few of you.  CNX Resources (CNX) is an oil and gas company and their earnings were terrible. Here's what is interesting; there was 32K open interest for Jul 6P, 28k puts for Oct 5p, and only 10k calls for Oct. Isn't that a little strange. That a lot of volume for a small company, seems like someone knows something we don't. \n\nThen there is Wright Medical Group NV (WMGI) which makes medical devices like joint implants and bone fixation devices for the foot and ankle and some other shit. They have 10k Aug 25P, 10k Aug 30p, and less than 4k volume for every other month. Weird. Do what you want with this information. I don't plan to do anything with these and wont include them in the TLDR or Plays. Here is [the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gcgyg5/3_unusual_options_activity_from_last_week/) going into more detail about this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast thing, I plan to make an entire separate post detailing my strategy when doing earnings plays tomorrow. I will go over how I decide when to sell and what it looks like when things go wrong. I decided to leave it out of the DD summaries because it is its own category and would take up a lot of space in already long posts. Let me know if you guys are interested in this!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck fuckers and tune in on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for more WSB DD Summaries!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR;** Zillow is absolute horse shit, next leg down is because of all the new money, land based oil is a good idea along with tankers, earnings play information session will come out tomorrow.\n\n**Plays;** Z puts for 5/15 and much farther out if you are willing to wait, MPLX, PAA, PBFX, DKL, SHLX, CNXM, MMP, and PAGP calls for late May/early June.\n\n**Previous WSB DD Summaries;** [4/23-4/24](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7f1m6/dd_from_423424_live_nation_oil_starbucks_and/), [4/25-4/27](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9a05f/dd_from_425427_the_markets_future_wingstop_huazhu/),[ 4/28-5/1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gby6ez/dd_from_42851_match_alphabet_and_a_reminder_tldr/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDISCLAIMER; I am not personally advocating for any play that I add to this list.

        "selftext": "Yesterday a post about PTON caught my attention. It was by [/u/The\\_Big\\_Short\\_2020](https://www.reddit.com/user/The_Big_Short_2020), a new account that had lost money on Blue Apron and zero previous winning trades. Naturally I was intrigued. He is going long with over 50k in calls into Peloton's earnings call on May 6th. IV is nuts at 190% for options due May 8th. The stock is up 19.7% in the past week. He owns one of their bikes, so you already know he is biased and brainwashed. Peloton is just like a cult. Beckies and sissies paying to ride an overpriced stationary bike. Never go against a cult stock, a lesson Tesla shorts forgot about. So I had to match his retardedness by going long 53k [https://imgur.com/a/my7JJXm](https://imgur.com/a/my7JJXm) . We will see if our cumulative 6 figure investment pays off. The following is the copy past of the his position and following that the DD he posted:\n\n  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gdj3zw/holding\\_over\\_50k\\_of\\_pton\\_calls\\_ahead\\_of\\_earnings/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gdj3zw/holding_over_50k_of_pton_calls_ahead_of_earnings/) \n\nPeloton is growing rapidly - app downloads have grown tenfold. Their stock popped 5 percent when they announced that they had their largest live class (23,000 riders) over a week ago. Their previous largest live class was 19k the day after Thanksgiving.\n\nFYI - I just did a live class and there were 29k riders present; this is 20 percent higher than their previous record which again caused their stock to surge when announced - Pton chose not to announce this. Why? I\u2019m not sure, maybe saving the good news for earnings?\n\nIm also bullish after calling the peloton delivery man who set up my peloton in February. During the phone call I had with him in late March, he said that they are 3x busier than the Christmas season and that he\u2019s never seen demand like this during the two years he\u2019s been with peloton. Though anecdotal, this tells me the lead time (in my area at least) is caused by the unprecedented demand for the bike. Demand during spring is huge because typically this is Peloton\u2019s offseason. If they have christmas like demand for all of 2020, they will destroy their revenue guidance. Let\u2019s also not forget that peloton lowered their revenue guidance during their last earnings call on Feb 5th before this pandemic hit. They will absolutely crush this lowered guidance, that would have never been lowered if they knew Mother Nature was going to give them the most ideal pandemic for their business model.\n\nLastly PTON CEO John Foley said in 2018 that if peloton wanted to turn a profit, they could do so tomorrow. The reason they don\u2019t is because they want to aggressively capture market share which is why they spent nearly all their profit on commercials. Notice anything lately? Peloton hasn\u2019t been airing commercials because there is no need with demand outstripping Manufactuing. This cut in add spending, coupled with unprecedented demand will allow them to reach profitably much sooner - if they announce that they expect to be profitable in 2021 - two years earlier than planned - than this stock will fucking soar.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nA lot of people see the treadmill cancellation as a negative but I\u2019ll argue it is a positive for two reasons:\n\n1) it is a lot larger and bulkier than the bikes. One treadmill takes the space of two bikes. Also the tread is a lot more time consuming to set up - even though Pton isn\u2019t stepping inside their customers houses, they still set up the equipment outside. Bikes only allow for a greater amount of deliveries at a more efficient rate per delivery.\n\n2) Pton has better margins on their bikes versus their treads.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTDLR: Pton lowered revenue guidance in February - before the pandemic hit. If they had 20/20 vision they would have raised their guidance. Cuts in add spending, coupled with high demand will allow Pton to reach profitability MUCH sooner than originally believed. Their live rider class counts have grown over 20 percent WITHIN THE PAST WEEK. The cancellation of Pton treadmills allow for more deliveries and better margins. The guy who set up my Pton (I live in metro Detroit) told me that demand is Christmas x3 right now which tells me the long lead time is more likely caused by the spike in demand, rather than supply chain issues.",

Here we are in the weekend of the first week of May, people's businesses are folding, renters demanding rent breaks, landlords sweating over insolvency and heart attacks just lost top spot in killer diseases to the most contagious virus any of us have ever seen in our lives; but none of this matter. Fed make market big big! Big big forever!\n\nThe bull [died  on the 28th of March](https://www.reddit.com/user/2020sbear/comments/g23ueb/the_bull_market_is_a_headless_chicken_and_the/).   The market *did break.* Just because people jumped in to short too early and have been getting roughed up 'Fighting the Fed' it does not change anything.  This spectacular 'Unprecedented' rally has not went up any more than historic bull traps.  The spiral of reduced wages &gt; reduced spending &gt; reduced business profits &gt; reduced wages (Loop) is still spinning. '[BRR BRR big big](https://imgur.com/a/S1T7IQQ)' is not improving real  GDP.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPeople think the market is not making sense, or not doing what it'd do if it was going to crash. This is not true. It's only not doing what you think it should do based upon what the news is telling you.  Once we'd seen the drop  of March what was to be expected was a bounce from the low and a [strong rally up to about 25,000  on the Dow peppered with positive news events.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/16/dow-jones-enters-end-of-denial-stage-and-start-of-the-bull-trap/)  All  of us who know how to trade have been waiting for that.\n\nThe market crash is going to be brutal. The second leg of the move will be bigger than the first one.  The low of the next drop can be under 50% from the high, and all the reasons people say that can't happen they said for the 2019 low breaking in  January, 2020.   A time when a 0.5% drop was considered buying the dip.\n\nWhat has taken weeks to go up will take hours to come down.  [A headline will come from no-where](https://www.reddit.com/user/2020sbear/comments/gatjxp/whatever_it_is_will_be_on_the_news/) and everything you think you know one day means nothing tomorrow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've done a lot of work on this trade.  How a trend fails and reverses is something I know a lot about. Whatever you do as an occupation and hobby - I know as much about this as you do about that. This is both my job and passion.  [I'm betting a lot of money on it,](https://www.reddit.com/user/2020sbear/comments/gbq6eu/big_short_end_of_day_3/) and I got my money by being really good at betting money in markets.\n\nI think the market is setting up to wipe people out.  Your warning sign of this is going to be the arrival of bad news in the coming week and a fall down to break the low of March. Around this time the news may seem to get better - but this will be your final chance to get out at a cheap loss (and yes, I consider a March low exit cheap relative to what June can bring).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not saying my forecasts are perfect. They are not, but they really have been good enough to do sensationally well during 2020. I've been short from feb. Long during early April and built up a short in the 24,000 - 25,000 Dow range.   I'll paste below a walk through of analysis and trades to this point. If you care to, you can check the accuracy of it and decide how useful my perspective is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\---\n\nFind a three year forecast of the [Dow Jones bear market of the 2020's here.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/16/three-year-forecast-of-dow-jones-crash/)\n\n\\---\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe US indices have been [forming a bubble](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/02/29/formingbubbles/) over the last 50 years. In 2000 and 2008 we seen the early 'Bear trap' sections of the bubble and then in the following decade we seen enthusiasm become greed and greed become delusion. The 30% gain in the S&amp;P500 through the year 2019 was the final stages of this bubble.\n\nHere is a post describing us being in the ['Delusion' stage of the bubble in January of 2020](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/SPX/KY1p7aZa-50-Years-Could-End-in-Tears-for-US-Indices/).\n\nThe pop of this bubble and the following bear market will not be a nice fast one like the crashes of 2000 and 2008, it will be a more drawn out affair where prices drop far lower. The crash of the 2020's will be more like the crash of the 1930's depression. See the analysis [leading to this conclusion here.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/01/us-indices-bubble-in-style-reflecting-the-great-depression-of-1930/)\n\nIn the months of January and February major US indices traded into the zone where a bubble template would be looking for the top to be made. Read about how this method has [worked in previous crashes here.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/05/how-technical-analysis-has-signalled-previous-stock-market-highs-and-now-again-in-2020/) First forecasts in late January were mostly stopped out. There were losing signals on the Dow [around 29,300](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/RGkn3RjW-Dow-Jones-Crucial-Support-Levels-in-the-Week-Ahead/) and some in [February at 28,900](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/xWSFpsRi-Selling-Dow-28-900/). Individual stocks shorts done poorly, One exception was the Vanguard dividends index VYM. This did make it's high on the [exact price first posted.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/VYM/BlWd0mFm-Popular-Vanguard-Has-High-Exposure-to-Bad-Market-Conditions/)\n\nIndividual stocks picks done particularly poorly in January. TSLA almost doubled from the first [shorting price of 510.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/TSLA/FOs1PP5d-Tesla-Could-Breakdown-Soon/) Some did a bit better. [Like shorting T at 39.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/T/IUgQyy8k-AT-T-Vulnerable-Debt-Cash-Flow-Leaks/)\n\nLater in February more sell signals were generated as price traded briefly over important resistance levels. If price broke back under these it would suggest market weakness. These were [170 on VTI](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/VTI/IPRCTQh9-VTI-Enters-the-Stubborn-Stage-of-a-Possible-Reversal/) and [29,000 on the Dow.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/LiV4pmmH-Dow-Jones-Crucial-Downside-Break-Possible/) Once these levels were broken the bear market began. In the following days a signal for a [30% drop on the Dow Jones came](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/Cd6Il3np-Next-Series-of-Falls-Can-Take-Dow-Down-10-000-Points/) (and was successful).\n\nIndividual stock picks did much better in February. High prices were signalled in [MSFT](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/MSFT/LWCMh0jH-Microsoft-Setting-Up-For-Hard-Landing/), [BRK](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/BRK.A/bHDf6D7j-Buffet-s-the-King-of-the-Bag-Holders/), [SPCE](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/SPCE/uFAroqOi-SPCE-and-Gravity/), [GOOG](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/GOOG/m56g98mU-Weekly-Bearish-Butterfly-Pattern/). A high on [AMZN was called](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/AMZN/b4DOD5dy-The-Amazon-Bubble/), but price later traded higher. The best signal generated was a buy on the [TVIX from 34 to 800.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/TVIX/ts9VcIlG-TVIX-Long-Term-Trend-Line-Break/)\n\nIn the month of March , 2020, the bubble popped. Most risk based assets and indices crashed over 30%. First analysis post said to [wait for a bounce to sell into](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/nVbfBVXn-Dow-Bounces-Like-a-Brick-While-Making-Big-Breakout/), but this was updated before the market opened to say prices could fall [8% and then 30% in March.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/01/30-dow-jones-drop/) At this point the TradingView account was suspended. Only one account is allowed, and this was set up specifically for a 2020's bear market. So no further posts or updates were made there.\n\nOn the 3rd of March came the first signal to [look for the down move entering somewhere in the 16,000 - 18,000 area](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/16/dow-jones-enters-end-of-denial-stage-and-start-of-the-bull-trap/) on the Dow Jones. Followed by a post on the 16th of March saying [we're entering into the bull trap.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/31/optimism-in-the-air-as-end-of-bull-trap-approaches/) The low on the Dow would be made around 18,250 on the 23rd of March. From here a rally began which has made a current high of 24,500.\n\nApril of 2020 has been the bull trap month. Some losing signals have been generated in the later couple weeks of April. A few calls on the top of the bull trap have been made. Prices have not went substantially higher, they've just not dropped. A forecast on the [17th of April marks the current high](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/16/17th-april-2020-the-bull-trap-completes/), but it looks like price can trade a bit higher. A post on the 19th of April calls for a crash in the S&amp;P500 to [1,600 within the next 5 - 10 weeks](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/19/19th-of-april-here-comes-an-attitude-readjustment/).\n\nToday is the 25th of April. Over the last two weeks forecasts of a big drop starting have been inaccurate. I very strongly suspect this is akin to the sell signals generated in late January and early February. It's the right idea, but it's just the wrong time. A top in the Dow Jones somewhere in the 24,000 - 25,000",

When big money hits the options market it is often the smart money that knows something we tards dont, so I try to follow those moves. There was a number of stonks on Friday (and last week) that were seeing high unusual options activity - see https://www.barchart.com/options/volume-leaders/stocks?page=1 for end of day data.\n\nOf many options that stood out to me (many of which I got into as well), $DIS call buying really stood out to me for a couple reasons. \n\n1. Technical setup is beautiful. DIS held $100 after poor ER &amp; is now pushing higher on positive reopening news. There is a gap that will lead us to $120 if we can break out past $113. \n2. On Friday alone the May15 $110s &amp; $112s were traded in high volume. The $110s traded 16k to oi of 20k and the $112s traded nearly 20k compared to an oi of just over 1k. When volume exceed oi like this it is a clear sign big traders are moving in. The $112s represent a trade of over $1M on OTM &lt;30delta that expires in a week.\n3. While the two prior points are really what I look for to execute a trade it is worth mentioning that laggards are beginning to come up, and leisure related stocks are rallying big time, DIS included. If this money flow/trade continues next week these calls will do nicely. \n\nI have 40 $112s @ .8 &amp; looking to add more Monday if it doesn't open up - not a huge trade right now but looking to double or triple up if I get the entry. If you can't control your tism &amp; want more unusual activity trades check out these (all calls).\n\nJD May15 $45, June19 $41, $45, $47, July $47\n\nTWTR May15 $30, May29 $33 &amp; $35\n\nLVS (similar momentum trade as DIS) May15 $53, June $50 $55 $60\n\nCCL May22 $15 &amp; $17\n\nDDOG May15 $60\n\nATVI May15 $74\n\nSDC May15 $7 $8.50 $9, June19 $10 &amp; $13\n\nMU May15 $48.50 &amp; $50\n\nON May15 $17\n\nWORK May15 $32\n\nTLRY May15 $8\n\nSNAP May15 $18.50\n\nTldr: A couple million dollars has gone into OTM DIS calls expiry Friday &amp; I am following the big money.
