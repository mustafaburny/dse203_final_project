        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, June 25, 2021**\n\n***Please note:*** *I've seen a lot of questions surrounding the analyst price target upgrades that I post, so I just wanted to clear some things up and explain my reasoning behind including them.*\n\n*I frequently get asked if I think analyst price target predictions are \"accurate\" or if I expect a stock I mention to hit the price predicted.* ***The answer to both these questions is NO.*** \n\n*I really don't put much, if any importance, on the actual numbers predicted by an analyst. They are just a meter to gauge how bullish or bearish they are. My purpose in including price target upgrades is to find trends in analyst thinking. In other words, if I see a bunch of different, well-known analysts all giving bullish target increases on a stock, I'll start doing research on a stock to see why they are so bullish. I have found quite a few profitable trades in this manner.*\n\n***In short, the purpose of the price target upgrades is idea generation. Keep an eye out if you start seeing the same stock receiving bullish target increases by different analysts.***\n\nStocks were mixed, but mostly positive today, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) recording a fresh intraday high and the Dow Jones (DIA) nicely continuing its recovery after falling last week, driven higher by a boost in bank stocks across the board after the Fed removed all pandemic-era restrictions on capital distributions. The Nasdaq (QQQ) fell modestly after several days of reaching new all-time highs. The core personal consumption expenditures, which serves as the Fed\u2019s preferred gauge for inflation was released but did not adversely affect the market, another signal the market is prepared to stomach higher than usual inflationary readings as the economy continues to recover. \n\nThe core PCE index measures the changes in prices paid by consumers for goods and services, minus volatile food and energy prices, which are staples and therefore not considered in the equation. The report registered a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, in-line with Wall Street estimates and marking the fastest jump since 1992. However, it is important to note that the report is still reflecting \u201cbase effects\u201d as prices rebound from the pandemic-induced collapse last year. \n\nYesterday, the Federal Reserve released the results of its \u201cstress test\u201d on US banks, an annual test instituted after the 2008 financial crisis meant to determine the financial health of lenders during an extreme hypothetical financial crisis (not unlike what was experienced last year).The test used a hypothetical \u201cseverely adverse\u201d scenario where the U.S. economy saw GDP shrink by 4%, the unemployment rate rise to 10.75%, and the stock market contract by 55%. In the end, the test showed the 23 largest banks could withstand $474 billion in losses from loans and other positions and still emerge with more than double the minimum required capital.\n\nThe results of this stress test are extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Given the clean bill of health, these restrictions have now been fully lifted, paving the way for banks across the board to raise dividends and ramp up stock buyback programs. To put in extent how much money this is, the six largest banks in the US - Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - are expected to increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion over the next four quarters.\n\nIn other news, President Joe Biden announced he had reached an infrastructure agreement with a bipartisan group of senators, which catalyzed a jump in industrial stocks that had been lagging the last few weeks. The deal, which would cost $1.2 trillion over the next five years, commits  $312 billion toward traditional infrastructure priorities such as roads, bridges, public transit, airports and waterways. The bulk of the remainder will be invested in water, broadband and power grid restoration, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House. \n\nGabriela Santos, global market strategist at JP Morgan said, \u201cThe way we're thinking about it is, it has the positive side of the deal in terms of the equity market perspective: More spending on physical infrastructure, electric vehicles, 5G and broadband, without the tax increases which would have been a negative from the equity market perspective. This is certainly a positive especially for the more domestic, cyclical-heavy parts of the market, as well as parts of technology like semiconductors, which are more related to the 5G and the green theme.\" \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Yesterday, ARK Investment Manager Cathie Wood and Twitter and Square (SQ) CEO Jack Dorsey have been named as co-hosts of \u201cThe \u20bf Word,\u201d a new initiative designed to bring business and technology leaders together to discuss how institutions can use digital currencies. Today, through Twitter (TWTR) Jack directly asked Elon to speak at the conference, which he accepted. Will be interesting to see what happens. \n* Panasonic, Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) leading battery supplier, announced it has sold its entire stake in TSLA stock for roughly $3.6 billion. There is no word as to why they did this but Panasonic assured the move would not affect its supply of batteries. Years ago, Panasonic made a $1.6 billion bet on building a joint battery factory with Tesla in Nevada called the Gigafactory. It caused years of losses at Panasonic before the company said this year it was finally turning a quarterly profit.\n* Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi is seeking to IPO in the US, according to the company\u2019s latest regulatory filing. \n* Starbucks CEO denied a Wall Street Journal report that the company was running low in supplies of cups and coffee. CEO Kevin Johnson told Jim Cramer, \u201cthere is no shortage of cups, no shortage of coffee\u201d.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written pre-market and does not reflect intraday changes\\*\\***\n* Accenture (ACN) with a host of target raises. Average price target $330 at Buy. Stock currently around $292\n* Analog Devices (ADI) target raised by Bank of America from $178 to $200 at Buy. Stock currently around $167\n* Carnival Cruises[ ](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CCL&amp;src=cashtag_click)(CCL) target raised by Stifel Nicolaus from $37 to $39 at Buy.

Stock currently around $304. The stock fell today despite posting record earnings. IMO an opportunity may be forming here, we all know how solid a company FDX is.\n   * BMO Capital Markets from $140 to $150\n   * Credit Suisse from $364 to $373 \n* Nike (NKE) with a host of target raises after smashing earnings yesterday. Average price target $170 at Buy. Stock currently around $152 after gapping up 13% after-hours.\n* Roku (ROKU) target raised by Bank of America from $450 to $500 at Buy. Stock currently around $423\n* Signature Bank (SBNY) target raised by Piper Sandler from $270 to $313 at Overweight.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, June 25, 2021**\n\n***Please note:*** *I've seen a lot of questions surrounding the analyst price target upgrades that I post, so I just wanted to clear some things up and explain my reasoning behind including them.*\n\n*I frequently get asked if I think  analyst price target predictions are \"accurate\" or if I expect a stock I mention to hit the price predicted.* ***The answer to both these questions is NO.*** \n\n*I really don't put much, if any importance, on the actual numbers predicted by an analyst. They are just a meter to gauge how bullish or bearish they are. My purpose in including price target upgrades is to find trends in analyst thinking. In other words, if I see a bunch of different, well-known analysts all giving bullish target increases on a stock, I'll start doing research on a stock to see why they are so bullish. I have found quite a few profitable trades in this manner.*\n\n*In short, the purpose of the price target upgrades is idea generation. Keep an eye out if you start seeing the same stock receiving bullish target increases by different analysts.*\n\nStocks were mixed, but mostly positive today, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) recording a fresh intraday high and the Dow Jones (DIA) nicely continuing its recovery after falling last week, driven higher by a boost in bank stocks across the board after the Fed removed all pandemic-era restrictions on capital distributions. The Nasdaq (QQQ) fell modestly after several days of reaching new all-time highs. The core personal consumption expenditures, which serves as the Fed\u2019s preferred gauge for inflation was released but did not adversely affect the market, another signal the market is prepared to stomach higher than usual inflationary readings as the economy continues to recover. \n\nThe core PCE index measures the changes in prices paid by consumers for goods and services, minus volatile food and energy prices, which are staples and therefore not considered in the equation. The report registered a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, in-line with Wall Street estimates and marking the fastest jump since 1992. However, it is important to note that the report is still reflecting \u201cbase effects\u201d as prices rebound from the pandemic-induced collapse last year. \n\nYesterday, the Federal Reserve released the results of its \u201cstress test\u201d on US banks, an annual test instituted after the 2008 financial crisis meant to determine the financial health of lenders during an extreme hypothetical financial crisis (not unlike what was experienced last year).The test used a hypothetical \u201cseverely adverse\u201d scenario where the U.S. economy saw GDP shrink by 4%, the unemployment rate rise to 10.75%, and the stock market contract by 55%. In the end, the test showed the 23 largest banks could withstand $474 billion in losses from loans and other positions and still emerge with more than double the minimum required capital.\n\nThe results of this stress test are extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Given the clean bill of health, these restrictions have now been fully lifted, paving the way for banks across the board to raise dividends and ramp up stock buyback programs. To put in extent how much money this is, the six largest banks in the US - Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - are expected to increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion over the next four quarters.\n\nIn other news, President Joe Biden announced he had reached an infrastructure agreement with a bipartisan group of senators, which catalyzed a jump in industrial stocks that had been lagging the last few weeks. The deal, which would cost $1.2 trillion over the next five years, commits  $312 billion toward traditional infrastructure priorities such as roads, bridges, public transit, airports and waterways. The bulk of the remainder will be invested in water, broadband and power grid restoration, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House. \n\nGabriela Santos, global market strategist at JP Morgan said, \u201cThe way we're thinking about it is, it has the positive side of the deal in terms of the equity market perspective: More spending on physical infrastructure, electric vehicles, 5G and broadband, without the tax increases which would have been a negative from the equity market perspective. This is certainly a positive especially for the more domestic, cyclical-heavy parts of the market, as well as parts of technology like semiconductors, which are more related to the 5G and the green theme.\" \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Yesterday, ARK Investment Manager Cathie Wood and Twitter and Square (SQ) CEO Jack Dorsey have been named as co-hosts of \u201cThe \u20bf Word,\u201d a new initiative designed to bring business and technology leaders together to discuss how institutions can use digital currencies. Today, through Twitter (TWTR) Jack directly asked Elon to speak at the conference, which he accepted. Will be interesting to see what happens. \n* Panasonic, Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) leading battery supplier, announced it has sold its entire stake in TSLA stock for roughly $3.6 billion. There is no word as to why they did this but Panasonic assured the move would not affect its supply of batteries. Years ago, Panasonic made a $1.6 billion bet on building a joint battery factory with Tesla in Nevada called the Gigafactory. It caused years of losses at Panasonic before the company said this year it was finally turning a quarterly profit.\n* Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi is seeking to IPO in the US, according to the company\u2019s latest regulatory filing. \n* Starbucks CEO denied a Wall Street Journal report that the company was running low in supplies of cups and coffee. CEO Kevin Johnson told Jim Cramer, \u201cthere is no shortage of cups, no shortage of coffee\u201d.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written pre-market and does not reflect intraday changes\\*\\***\n* Accenture (ACN) with a host of target raises. Average price target $330 at Buy. Stock currently around $292\n* Analog Devices (ADI) target raised by Bank of America from $178 to $200 at Buy. Stock currently around $167\n* Carnival Cruises[ ](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CCL&amp;src=cashtag_click)(CCL) target raised by Stifel Nicolaus from $37 to $39 at Buy.

Stock currently around $304. The stock fell today despite posting record earnings. IMO an opportunity may be forming here, we all know how solid a company FDX is.\n   * BMO Capital Markets from $140 to $150\n   * Credit Suisse from $364 to $373 \n* Nike (NKE) with a host of target raises after smashing earnings yesterday. Average price target $170 at Buy. Stock currently around $152 after gapping up 13% after-hours.\n* Roku (ROKU) target raised by Bank of America from $450 to $500 at Buy. Stock currently around $423\n* Signature Bank (SBNY) target raised by Piper Sandler from $270 to $313 at Overweight.
