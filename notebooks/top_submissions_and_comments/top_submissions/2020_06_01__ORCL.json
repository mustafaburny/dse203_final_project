        "selftext": "*\"In the short run, the market is a voting machine, but, in the long run, it is a weighing machine\" -Benjamin Graham*\n\nWarren Buffett has taken some heat recently over his decision to sell all of his airline stocks near their lowest point. Amid investor optimism for the return of \"normal\" travel behavior, airline stock prices took flight, so to speak, as a primary beneficiary of this exuberance. This has every investor with a Pied Piper trading account sitting on his couch thinking he is smarter than perhaps the greatest investor of our time. But is he?\n\n* Warren Buffett is not a short-term swing trader, he is a long-term, buy-and-hold investor. He looks at the prospects of a company 20 to 30 years down the road, not 2-3 months\n* Airlines represented a significant, but relatively small portion of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. Taking a loss on an industry that is in turmoil for the chance to redeploy in another industry with clearer skies ahead is more in line with the investing philosophy that made him a success\n* Armchair investors think to themselves, \"Well, people won't stop flying\", I'll buy AAL, UAL, and DAL. While that is certainly true in the broad sense, think about the practical sense. Airlines need to squeeze every dollar out of every flight to remain profitable. Under the \"new normal\", not only might the incredibly important Middle Seat be in jeopardy, but the ridiculously profitable Business Class seat is also going to see massive declines as more and more business is conducted remotely.\n* With cash burn rates in the double-digit millions of dollars PER DAY, many major U.S. airlines are only in business due to federal government bailout money -- one of the conditions of which was that they keep paying their employees that are not doing much flying (or revenue generation) these days.\n* While it is a near certainty that \"people won't stop flying\", there is no certainty about who will be doing the flying. When the bailout money is gone, the cash is depleted, and the revenues are a fraction of where they need to be, a company goes bankrupt. It is entirely possible that one or even two of the major U.S. airline carriers never get their head above water again. Which ones? (\\*Casually glances at American and United\\*) I'm not sure, BUT, what I am sure about, is that Warren Buffett has access to way more information about the companies he invests in than you or me.\n* Last Thursday, while AAL stock was almost doubling, 14 of its top officers VOLUNTARILY took buyouts to leave the company. Now, ask yourself -- why would anyone in their right mind in a leadership role at a prominent U.S. company with a huge salary and comfy corner office voluntarily leave that company and deny themselves the personal glory of being part of a turnaround story?\n\n**My advice:** Take your profits now and buy yourself something nice -- like stock in a company that actually has massive future growth and profit potential. And do not think that you are smarter than Warren Buffett.\n\nFinally, they are a few years old, but these nifty infographics offer a fun insight into what makes the Oracle of Omaha tick:\n\n[Part One: The Early Years](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/warren-buffett-series-early-years/)\n\n[Part Two: Inside Buffett's Brain](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/inside-warren-buffetts-brain/)\n\n[Part Three: The Warren Buffett Empire](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/warren-buffett-empire-giant-chart/)\n\n[Part Four: Buffett's Biggest Wins and Fails](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/warren-buffetts-biggest-wins-and-fails/)\n\n[Part Five: Wisdom from The Oracle](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-25-best-warren-buffett-quotes-in-one-infographic/)",

Here comes my next play with a similar amount of heads up, ORCL. Lets see if we can beat the previous gains (CLDR is going to be tough to beat honestly that was huge).   \n\n\n**TL;DR** \\- Oracle(ORCL) has earning coming up on 6/17 (After Market). ORCL is yet another! cloud company that also provides database software solutions. As all of our previous plays they are benefiting even more from the current situation. Further multiplied by multiple companies looking to invest in more cloud infrastructure, remote engineers and so forth. Huge potential to rocket up in the next few weeks. Plays - **ORCL $55c &amp; $60c 7/17**\n\n**What is Oracle?**  \nOracle is in the big leagues with the likes of Microsoft, leading the cloud and database space. Oracle Corporation provides products and services that address enterprise information technology environments worldwide including cloud, software as a service and data base tech. They are investing heavily and maybe even leading the autonomous database through AI which is growing more critical every day to to the exponential amount of data needed to be stored, analyzed and used.   \n\n\n**Financials** \n\n* The company generated around $40 billion in revenue and over $10 billion in earnings every quarter (27% profit margin) for the past year. It's also met or beaten analyst expectations for EPS over the same time period. \n* Oracle's revenue stability comes from its cloud computing and licensing services, which account for over 70% of company revenue.  \n* Strong and stable dividends.\n* Short Term and Long Term Liabilities - ORCL short term assets of $33.4b exceed short term liabilities of $15.74b significantly.   \n\n\n**Play**\n\nORCL $55c &amp; $60c 7/17\n\nI am also thinking about getting in on the same positions for 6/19.\n\n**What are your thoughts?**",

Here comes my next play, SMPL. Lets see if we can beat the previous gains.\n\n**TL;DR** \\- The Simply Good Foods Company(SMPL) has earning coming up on 7/8 (Pre Market). Unlike my regular cloud plays this one is all about \"simple\" food. Not just any food but easily consumed and healthy food such as protein shakes, bars, snacks, frozen meals and more. People are eating out less and eating in more, so making it simpler is effective. **Play - SMPL $20c 7/17 &amp; SMPL $30c 8/21**\n\n**What is SMPL?**\n\nThe Simply Good Foods company is a developer, marketer and seller of branded nutritional foods and snacking products which from recently now also includes the Quest brand. Other companies in the industry have reached or exceeded pre-covid levels. The stock price is still 25% less than pre-covid average. In the last few months there has been a high volume of insider trading by SMPL executives with over 200K shares bought in the last 3 month and another 120K in the time period between 3 - 6 month ago. \n\n**Financials**\n\n\u00b7 The company generated around $650 million in revenue in the last earnings with a constant earning to earning growth. It's also met or beaten most analyst expectations EPS over the same time period.\n\n\u00b7 Short Term and Long Term Liabilities - SMPL short term assets of $235M exceed short term liabilities of $74.29M significantly.\n\n**Play**\n\n**SMPL $20c 7/17 &amp; SMPL $30c 8/21**\n\n**What are your thoughts?**",

They have acquired Acme Packet (produces and markets session border controllers, multiservice security gateways and session routing proxies), BEA Systems (specializes in enterprise infrastructure software products), Hyperion Corp. (Financial Management System that provides financial consolidation and reporting that enables you to rapidly consolidate and report financial results), MICRO Systems (designs and engineers processor-based control systems, unmanned vehicle control stations, and flight terminal systems), NetSuite (cloud ERP enterprise that provides SaaS to manage to manage business finances, operations and customer relations), PeopleSoft (ERP that provides human resource management systems, financial management solutions, supply chain management solutions and enterprise performance solutions), Siebel Systems (CRM engaged in design, development, marketing, and support) and Sun MicroSystems (sells computers, computer components, and IT services - also the creator of Java). Essentially, they are one of the biggest leaders of Cloud.\n\nCOVID has further increased the demand and need of Cloud and has accelerated the integration of Cloud-based companies. As such, ORCL is expected to achieve higher levels of growth.\n\nKey Highlights:\n\n\\- ORCL's next quarterly ER: **June 17, 2020**\n\n\\- ORCL stock has recovered from the crash relatively quickly and has shown a pretty strong support of $51 and resistance of \\~$54. Current stock price $53.06 (with a moderate down-trend).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1t1qaasigd251.png?width=1213&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f60e1d579092fd1cf1c9208a44e5e63c12b1b0eb\n\n\\- The highest EPS forecast recorded in ORCL's history for the upcoming ER (1.2 vs 0.96 of last quarter - pre-covid)\n\n\\- Multiple revenue streams while showing steady growth\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u66dsrdumd251.png?width=831&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9d6a0e957db2322fdfb45c4b6d0331d70768f9f\n\n\\- Many fear the next S&amp;P500 slide is soon coming as we're nearing its pre-covid number, but SPY vs ORCL correlation index is 0.44 so rest assured, ORCL will not be impacted as much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p5asbgoymd251.png?width=1337&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca88c90da438a9dafc667e4b010820e84d8d4414\n\n\\- Low IV  (soon to increase) and the recent drop signals a great entry point.\n\nPotential:\n\nMost cloud companies' stock price surged pre and post ER breaking its ATH.

        "selftext": "The FT recently published an article arguing that Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway are [losing their touch](https://www.ft.com/content/ee69a200-6f3f-4c0e-948b-37e8f9519077).\n\n* The company is sitting on [$137B in cash](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/why-warren-buffett-unhappy-berkshire-hathaway-record-137-billion-cash-2020-4-1029181516).\n* They typically avoids industries [Buffett says he doesn\u2019t understand](https://business.financialpost.com/investing/buffetts-apple-losses-make-his-track-record-in-tech-even-worse), like technology or biotech.\n* As a result, it\u2019s been doing quite poorly over the past 6 months, [losing about 20% of its value](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BRK-A?p=BRK-A&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch).\n\nWarren Buffett is a more seasoned and successful investor than I am; I\u2019d like to defend him and his strategy. He\u2019s not losing his touch, but his industry focus shows what the broader investment community gets wrong \u2013 and what your own advisors or analysts might also be missing.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway invests in traditional, tangible asset-focused companies. This includes banks, insurance companies (they own GEICO), railways, and until recently, airlines.\n\n* This strategy works well in how they approach value investing; they understand when companies take risks with their physical assets and how much those assets are truly worth.\n* These investors have a sophisticated and non-consensus (compared to other investors) view on how to depreciate assets properly, [how to avoid metrics like EBITDA](https://www.oldschoolvalue.com/investing-strategy/buffett-klarman-ebitda/), and how to think about a company\u2019s long-term potential.\n* They have a deeply sophisticated view of how infrastructure, physical assets, and financial assets work.\n* This allows them to make very long-term bets and find opportunities that other investors miss due to their focus on P/E ratios and accounting jargon like EBITDA.\n\n***The fact that they\u2019re not investing right now tells me they don\u2019t see good opportunities in these traditional spaces*** (like banking, retail, transportation, and consumer goods).\n\n***But the term \u201ctraditional\u201d is important.***. It tends to avoid hard and soft technology companies, like those in information technology, social media, and biotechnology. Many investors still don\u2019t completely understand how \u201chard\u201d and \u201csoft\u201d technology investments work and how to price them.\n\n* Many companies (e.g., Google, Shopify, Facebook) tend to be physical asset-poor but data-rich. [Valuing data is *very* difficult.](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691175034/capitalism-without-capital)\n* These companies often facilitate transactions and take a cut of a broader market, rather than owning the market itself.\n* If you include \u201chard tech\u201d like biotechnology research, pharma, or cybersecurity and quantum computing, then this is even more difficult.\n* Investment success depends on intangible assets generating cash *one day*, combined with experimental success in the short run. It\u2019s immensely difficult to screen stocks or use traditional accounting measures to do so.\n\n***Case in point: how do you formally depreciate data assets?***\n\nBuffett and other traditional value and fundamental investors are being hit hard because COVID-19 is hitting the industries *they* focus on *disproportionately* hard.\n\nDigital companies, as well as ones focused on transaction facilitation and digital/data products, are particularly resilient when it comes to their business models.\n\nIn short, Buffett isn\u2019t losing touch... But if you\u2019re an investor that follows traditional industries then you should revisit your asset mix. Don\u2019t just look at your stocks/bonds/cash/ETFs mix but also differentiate between traditional tangible industries/investments, and ***those which are intangible and often overlooked by asset managers following the \u201cOracle of Omaha\u201d***.\n\nGiven how people view this -- I'd love to hear if YOU think about intangible vs. tangible assets, and also how you value the former.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nNote, I [posted this online](https://chimerais.com/covid19-jun17-buffett-intangible-data-assets) for posterity as well.",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 15th, 2020.\n\n# **After big sell-off, stock market will be wary of virus and Fed testimony in week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/12/after-big-sell-off-stock-market-will-be-wary-of-virus-and-fed-testimony-in-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to reassure markets next week the central bank will do whatever it takes to help the economy heal. That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks could be caught in a tug-of-war in the week ahead, as investors weigh the potential positives of a reopening economy against worry that the coronavirus continues to spread. \n*****\n&gt; In the past week, the S&amp;P 500\u2032s sharp gains briefly drove the index into positive territory for the year, before a bruising sell-off at the end of the week. Stocks were more than 47% above the March 23 low before investors got spooked by signs the coronavirus is picking up in some areas. \n*****\n&gt; The Fed also dampened sentiment when it released economic forecasts Wednesday that showed a slow recovery and interest rates at zero through the end of 2022. Investors will hear more of the same when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks before Congress this Tuesday and Wednesday in his semi-annual economic testimony. He may provide more clarity on the Fed\u2019s bond buying and other policy moves.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales for May are released Tuesday, and that will be an important look at consumer spending activity. It is the most important data in the coming week, other than the weekly jobless claims report on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks rose on Friday with the S&amp;P 500 up more than 1% after Thursday\u2019s sharp sell-off that sent the index down nearly 6%. Treasury yields, which move opposite price, also moved sharply lower as investors moved to the safety of bonds. The 10-year yield was back to 0.70%,  well off the high of 0.95% in the week earlier.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve been overbought for awhile and digesting gains would be natural,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said the fact that 97% of the S&amp;P 500 companies\u2019 stocks were above their 50-day moving average this past week was a warning. The 50-day moving average is a momentum indicator, and if a stock or index rises above it, it is usually a positive, but if they all do, it\u2019s a contrarian warning.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cHistorically that\u2019s just too high ... and also the P/E on the S&amp;P was 25.1 of forward 12-months earnings, which is a 52% premium to the P/E average since 2000,\u201d he said. The P/E, or the price-to-earnings ratio, is an important tool to value stocks, and it averages around 16.5 times.\n*****\n&gt; In the sell-off, stocks that would benefit from the economy\u2019s reopening were the hardest hit. Investors had been jumping into those names, driving them higher at a dizzying pace. They were also the sectors that were last to join the rally, like banks, casinos, airlines and hotels.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOnce the pullback runs its course I think investors will move back again into the sectors and subsectors that were most beaten up in the bear market,\u201d said Stovall.  \n*****\n&gt; Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com, said he lightened up his holdings earlier in the week. \u201cThere were some clues early in the week that the market was vulnerable, like when the S&amp;P closed below 3,191 on Tuesday. You had some feverish trading in some of the very speculative names,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said other headwinds hang over the market, and one big one is the upcoming presidential election, which could become a bigger influence on the market. RealClearPolitics has President Donald Trump trailing former Vice President Joseph Biden by 8.1 points in the latest average of polls.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cTrump\u2019s numbers are just looking so bad, and if the Fed needs to keep interest rates at zero and we have the potential for a resurgence in Covid cases, then Trump is not going to benefit from an economic recovery, and as a result, that gives Biden a better chance of being elected,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily that the market dislikes Biden, but they dislike uncertainty. And a decline in equity prices would be representative of that uncertainty.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Consumer barometer\n&gt; Retail sales are typically a barometer for consumer spending, and when Americans were shut in their homes they did much less shopping than usual. April data showed a 16.7% drop in sales, but consumers did spend online.\n*****\n&gt; Economists are watching Tuesday\u2019s report on May sales closely, particularly after the May jobs report had a large upside surprise. There were 2.5 million jobs added in May, instead of an expected loss of 8.3 million.\n*****\n&gt; Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, said business-to-business spending data for May implies that retail sales were flat compared with April\u2019s depressed level and could be down 22% from a year ago.\n*****\n&gt; Zandi used data from Cortera, which collects information on about $1.5 trillion in business-to-business spending. In an analysis of spending by retailers in May, it found there were gains from April in some categories, including furniture, gasoline stations and restaurants.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cClothing and sporting goods store sales have been crushed, and that continued in May.  Restaurants,  gasoline stations and furniture stores have been hit hard, but showed strong improvement in May. Food and health and personal care stores have done well through the crisis, but gave some of that back in May,\u201d notes Zandi. \u201cOnline retailers, general merchandise stores (which includes WalMart and Target), and building material and garden supply stores (Home Depot and Lowes) have navigated the crisis well, and May was another solid month.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Zandi said weakness in apparel and sporting goods washed out the gains in other areas.\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead \n&gt; Strategists said Powell did not surprise the market with his comments this past week, but his sober approach reminded investors that the Fed policy will have to be in place for a very long time to pull the economy out of its deep rut. That will keep markets on high alert during his two days of testimony.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the cat\u2019s out of the bag. I don\u2019t think he can sugarcoat it. The thing he\u2019s got to worry about is he needs help. He needs Congress and the administration to come up with another fiscal rescue package. He can\u2019t do it on his own,\u201d said Zandi. \u201cHe has to keep the pressure on them and get a piece of legislation before they go on August recess.  ... He\u2019s speaking as much to the American people as he is to the policy makers.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Zandi said the Fed has acted aggressively and swiftly to unfreeze credit markets when they locked up in March, but the economy needs more stimulus ahead of a wave of potential business defaults and with a high level of unemployment. The Fed\u2019s balance sheet has ballooned to $7.2 trillion, and on Wednesday the central bank committed to monthly purchases of $80 billion in Treasury securities and $40 billion in mortgage securities.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think he continues to lay the foundation for policy changes to come,\u201d  said Zandi. \u201cHe\u2019s strongly suggesting there\u2019s going to be more monetary support, and that would come in the form of a few things - it would be performance dependent forward guidance. ... He\u2019s going to make it clear until the economy is at full employment and inflation is at least at target, if not above.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Zandi said Powell may discuss yield curve controls, which would mean the Fed would set targets for interest rate levels in the Treasury market, and make purchases to influence rates. Some economists believe the Fed  will adopt that tool before the end of the year.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think he\u2019s going to more clearly define the amount of QE they\u2019re doing going forward. He\u2019ll try to preserve some optionality, but he\u2019ll try to make it known, they\u2019re buying a lot of bonds for a long time to come,\u201d Zandi said.\n*****\n&gt; But the hearings could be more politicized, and Powell may be criticized by Congress for helping financial markets more than Main Street, said John Briggs, head of strategy at NatWest Markets. \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if there\u2019s a lot new, given it comes on the heels of the FOMC meeting,\u201d Briggs said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/pw0CUi2.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/fP1CK0o.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/UO6j0gC.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/GImgVgH.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JYCJeEm.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qcLni34.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/iC1YmSV.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qsph2Sm.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vM5brmK.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/LscP3vHv/ipos12.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/1Y2bHjI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/hrsZdEH.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Is This The Start Of A New Bear Market?\n\n&gt; \u201cStocks take an escalator up, but an elevator down.\u201d \u2014 Old investment axiom\n\n&gt; The saying above sure happened yesterday. In the end, the S&amp;P 500 Index fell 5.9% for the worst day since March 16 and the first three-day losing streak in more than three months. What does it mean? We\u2019ve been on record that we expect some type of well-deserved pullback or at least consolidation after the 45% bounce off of the March 23 lows and the best 50-day rally ever. Then add in the fact that June has been the worst month of the year for stocks since 2000 and some type of weakness is perfectly logical here and now.\n\n&gt; \u201cIn many ways, this is one of the most overbought stock markets we\u2019ve ever seen. Now the catch to this is previous times we\u2019ve seen major levels similar to now have been closer to the beginning of bull markets than the end of bull markets,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; This is now one of the greatest surges off a major low ever. It is perfectly normal to see a drawdown of double digits after the initial surge weakens. This could be happening now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We\u2019ve shown that huge up months like April tend to eventually resolve higher, but some near-term weakness is possible.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Also, when more than 90% of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are above their 50-day moving average, this shows solid longer-term results. Again, suggesting that very overbought isn\u2019t always a bad thing.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; There was a huge spike in stocks marking new monthly highs, again historically an overbought signal. This opens the door for some near-term weakness, but is a very positive sign longer-term.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Last, in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 was recently more than 13% above the 50-day moving average, one of the highest levels ever. The good news is one-year later stocks were higher every single time. Yet another clue that historically overbought isn\u2019t always a bad thing for the bulls.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; A record run, over-the-top excitement from small traders, the Nasdaq at 10,000, historically high multiples, and seasonality all could be a factor in why a pullback here could be perfectly normal. In fact, if you are bullish, after a 45% rally, one of the best things would be for prices to reset some here over the coming months. We would be a buyer of weakness and use it as an opportunity for longer-term price appreciation.\n\n*****\n\n# Persistent Volatility Runs Into Resistance &amp; Exuberant Sentiment\n\n&gt; We have all been gobsmacked by velocity and strength of this V-shaped rally off the March 23 bear market low. For the record this rally became an official Ned Davis Research defined bull market on May 26 when DJIA was up 30% from the low when it made a new recovery high after 50 calendar days (see NDR definitions below). And this was on the back of the shortest bear market on record, which lasted only 40 days. Today\u2019s market comeuppance is an important reminder that we need to be patient with this market and heed our cautious analysis and stance.\n\n&gt; This is still the \u201cWorst Six Months\u201d and as we warned in the May Outlook when the market is down during the \u201cBest Six Months\u201d (November-April) as they were in 2020, the \u201cWorst Six Months\u201d (May-October) were down or flat 86% of the time with a median S&amp;P decline of -6.7% since 1950.\n\n&gt; Other seasonal indicators are also flashing the caution sign. This year\u2019s negative January Barometer and breached December DJIA low, point to possible retests of the lows and choppy, volatile trading over the next several months. See the updated composite graph of the seasonal pattern for these 22 years since 1950 in the June Outlook.\n\n&gt; It appears that quite a fair amount of hope was built into the rally. Lots of hope that everything is just going back to the way it was real soon. But COVID cases are on the climb again and folks are concerned that a pause and/or reverse of reopening could delay the economic recovery and derail the bull. Up until the past few days it felt like mid-February again with the market ignoring economic and corporate data as momentum pushed everything higher.\n\n&gt; The jobs report was a bit unbelievable and then Fed Chairman Powell\u2019s candor and reserved outlook at yesterday\u2019s press conference put the fear right back into the market today. Meanwhile the Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDPNow model currently estimates that 2020 Q2 GDP growth will be down -48.5%.\n\n&gt; Sentiment had also become rather exuberant as the Weekly CBOE Equity Only Put/Call ratio we track in the \u201cPulse of the Market\u201d hit 0.43 last week \u2013 its lowest level since the week ending 4/10/2010 about three weeks before the infamous flash crash. Investor\u2019s Intelligence Advisors Sentiment survey Bullish advisors are now up to 56.9%. Correction advisors are down to 22.5% while Bearish advisors have slipped further to 20.6%, putting us at caution levels.\n\n&gt; Technically, things deteriorated rapidly today. After blasting through several levels of resistance we have been tracking as shown in the chart here S&amp;P 500 stalled at 3210 and plunged 5.9% today through 3115 support/resistance and closed just below 3010 support/resistance which sits at the 2019 summer highs. The next major support level below here is 2725 right near where the 50-day moving average turned up in mid-May, which would be a 15.7% correction from the recent recovery high reached this past Monday, June 8.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7d877af1643a7342c0c8622cbc763c92/eb566818257f08b5-2b/s500x750/8228cad8989a5456266c3f0d753168c4d3c3efec.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Ned Davis Research bull and bear market definitions:\n\n&gt; A cyclical bull market requires a 30% rise in the DJIA after 50 calendar days or a 13% rise after 155 calendar days. Reversals of 30% in the Value Line Geometric Index since 1965 also qualify. A cyclical bear market requires a 30% drop in the DJIA after 50 calendar days or a 13% decline after 145 calendar days. Reversals in the Value Line Geometric Index also qualify. Bull and bear markets are measured at peak and trough dates, so both the time and price criteria must be met as of the peak and trough dates.\n\n*****\n\n# More Volatility Likely During June Options Expiration Week and Beyond\n\n&gt; The second Triple Witching Week (Quadruple Witching if you prefer) of the year brings on some volatile trading with losses frequently exceeding gains. NASDAQ has the weakest record on the first trading day of the week. Triple-Witching Friday is usually better, DJIA has been up ten of the last seventeen years.\n\n&gt; Full-week performance is choppy as well, littered with greater than 1% moves in both directions. The week after Triple-Witching Day is horrendous. This week has experienced DJIA losses in 26 of the last 30 years with an average decline of 1.07%. S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have fared slightly better during the week after over the same 30-year span, declining 0.72% and 0.23% respectively on average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cbdc17aecf40cbf412100049a35e7f1b/4c6fa6c95e723529-93/s500x750/0bd7385e1b398b3c223892fe86cd1886d41bc9fd.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8de0bdcd706b729d7e5ebe8fd92670b9/4c6fa6c95e723529-e7/s500x750/fa1a12f3de57328b97c1f4f5a274d24e94fd19de.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/09c9ca9d3a0502b4a8d97976bd73366e/4c6fa6c95e723529-cf/s500x750/498b4d398dde04ebb764b72d962aa53378b29260.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/vM5brmK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/l3jztzJ.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.15.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/shKM8RG.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.16.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PYffarr.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0uE8QeB.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/bNd3sxx.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HdpyR9B.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.18.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DNsufe6.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.19.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FHBG6yj.png))\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.19.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Kroger Co. $32.26\n&gt; **Kroger Co.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 15th, 2020.\n\n# **After big sell-off, stock market will be wary of virus and Fed testimony in week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/12/after-big-sell-off-stock-market-will-be-wary-of-virus-and-fed-testimony-in-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to reassure markets next week the central bank will do whatever it takes to help the economy heal. That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks could be caught in a tug-of-war in the week ahead, as investors weigh the potential positives of a reopening economy against worry that the coronavirus continues to spread. \n*****\n&gt; In the past week, the S&amp;P 500\u2032s sharp gains briefly drove the index into positive territory for the year, before a bruising sell-off at the end of the week. Stocks were more than 47% above the March 23 low before investors got spooked by signs the coronavirus is picking up in some areas. \n*****\n&gt; The Fed also dampened sentiment when it released economic forecasts Wednesday that showed a slow recovery and interest rates at zero through the end of 2022. Investors will hear more of the same when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks before Congress this Tuesday and Wednesday in his semi-annual economic testimony. He may provide more clarity on the Fed\u2019s bond buying and other policy moves.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales for May are released Tuesday, and that will be an important look at consumer spending activity. It is the most important data in the coming week, other than the weekly jobless claims report on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks rose on Friday with the S&amp;P 500 up more than 1% after Thursday\u2019s sharp sell-off that sent the index down nearly 6%. Treasury yields, which move opposite price, also moved sharply lower as investors moved to the safety of bonds. The 10-year yield was back to 0.70%,  well off the high of 0.95% in the week earlier.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve been overbought for awhile and digesting gains would be natural,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said the fact that 97% of the S&amp;P 500 companies\u2019 stocks were above their 50-day moving average this past week was a warning. The 50-day moving average is a momentum indicator, and if a stock or index rises above it, it is usually a positive, but if they all do, it\u2019s a contrarian warning.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cHistorically that\u2019s just too high ... and also the P/E on the S&amp;P was 25.1 of forward 12-months earnings, which is a 52% premium to the P/E average since 2000,\u201d he said. The P/E, or the price-to-earnings ratio, is an important tool to value stocks, and it averages around 16.5 times.\n*****\n&gt; In the sell-off, stocks that would benefit from the economy\u2019s reopening were the hardest hit. Investors had been jumping into those names, driving them higher at a dizzying pace. They were also the sectors that were last to join the rally, like banks, casinos, airlines and hotels.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOnce the pullback runs its course I think investors will move back again into the sectors and subsectors that were most beaten up in the bear market,\u201d said Stovall.  \n*****\n&gt; Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com, said he lightened up his holdings earlier in the week. \u201cThere were some clues early in the week that the market was vulnerable, like when the S&amp;P closed below 3,191 on Tuesday. You had some feverish trading in some of the very speculative names,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said other headwinds hang over the market, and one big one is the upcoming presidential election, which could become a bigger influence on the market. RealClearPolitics has President Donald Trump trailing former Vice President Joseph Biden by 8.1 points in the latest average of polls.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cTrump\u2019s numbers are just looking so bad, and if the Fed needs to keep interest rates at zero and we have the potential for a resurgence in Covid cases, then Trump is not going to benefit from an economic recovery, and as a result, that gives Biden a better chance of being elected,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily that the market dislikes Biden, but they dislike uncertainty. And a decline in equity prices would be representative of that uncertainty.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Consumer barometer\n&gt; Retail sales are typically a barometer for consumer spending, and when Americans were shut in their homes they did much less shopping than usual. April data showed a 16.7% drop in sales, but consumers did spend online.\n*****\n&gt; Economists are watching Tuesday\u2019s report on May sales closely, particularly after the May jobs report had a large upside surprise. There were 2.5 million jobs added in May, instead of an expected loss of 8.3 million.\n*****\n&gt; Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, said business-to-business spending data for May implies that retail sales were flat compared with April\u2019s depressed level and could be down 22% from a year ago.\n*****\n&gt; Zandi used data from Cortera, which collects information on about $1.5 trillion in business-to-business spending. In an analysis of spending by retailers in May, it found there were gains from April in some categories, including furniture, gasoline stations and restaurants.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cClothing and sporting goods store sales have been crushed, and that continued in May.  Restaurants,  gasoline stations and furniture stores have been hit hard, but showed strong improvement in May. Food and health and personal care stores have done well through the crisis, but gave some of that back in May,\u201d notes Zandi. \u201cOnline retailers, general merchandise stores (which includes WalMart and Target), and building material and garden supply stores (Home Depot and Lowes) have navigated the crisis well, and May was another solid month.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Zandi said weakness in apparel and sporting goods washed out the gains in other areas.\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead \n&gt; Strategists said Powell did not surprise the market with his comments this past week, but his sober approach reminded investors that the Fed policy will have to be in place for a very long time to pull the economy out of its deep rut. That will keep markets on high alert during his two days of testimony.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the cat\u2019s out of the bag. I don\u2019t think he can sugarcoat it. The thing he\u2019s got to worry about is he needs help. He needs Congress and the administration to come up with another fiscal rescue package. He can\u2019t do it on his own,\u201d said Zandi. \u201cHe has to keep the pressure on them and get a piece of legislation before they go on August recess.  ... He\u2019s speaking as much to the American people as he is to the policy makers.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Zandi said the Fed has acted aggressively and swiftly to unfreeze credit markets when they locked up in March, but the economy needs more stimulus ahead of a wave of potential business defaults and with a high level of unemployment. The Fed\u2019s balance sheet has ballooned to $7.2 trillion, and on Wednesday the central bank committed to monthly purchases of $80 billion in Treasury securities and $40 billion in mortgage securities.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think he continues to lay the foundation for policy changes to come,\u201d  said Zandi. \u201cHe\u2019s strongly suggesting there\u2019s going to be more monetary support, and that would come in the form of a few things - it would be performance dependent forward guidance. ... He\u2019s going to make it clear until the economy is at full employment and inflation is at least at target, if not above.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Zandi said Powell may discuss yield curve controls, which would mean the Fed would set targets for interest rate levels in the Treasury market, and make purchases to influence rates. Some economists believe the Fed  will adopt that tool before the end of the year.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think he\u2019s going to more clearly define the amount of QE they\u2019re doing going forward. He\u2019ll try to preserve some optionality, but he\u2019ll try to make it known, they\u2019re buying a lot of bonds for a long time to come,\u201d Zandi said.\n*****\n&gt; But the hearings could be more politicized, and Powell may be criticized by Congress for helping financial markets more than Main Street, said John Briggs, head of strategy at NatWest Markets. \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if there\u2019s a lot new, given it comes on the heels of the FOMC meeting,\u201d Briggs said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/pw0CUi2.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/fP1CK0o.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/UO6j0gC.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/GImgVgH.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JYCJeEm.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qcLni34.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/iC1YmSV.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qsph2Sm.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vM5brmK.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/LscP3vHv/ipos12.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/1Y2bHjI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/hrsZdEH.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Is This The Start Of A New Bear Market?\n\n&gt; \u201cStocks take an escalator up, but an elevator down.\u201d \u2014 Old investment axiom\n\n&gt; The saying above sure happened yesterday. In the end, the S&amp;P 500 Index fell 5.9% for the worst day since March 16 and the first three-day losing streak in more than three months. What does it mean? We\u2019ve been on record that we expect some type of well-deserved pullback or at least consolidation after the 45% bounce off of the March 23 lows and the best 50-day rally ever. Then add in the fact that June has been the worst month of the year for stocks since 2000 and some type of weakness is perfectly logical here and now.\n\n&gt; \u201cIn many ways, this is one of the most overbought stock markets we\u2019ve ever seen. Now the catch to this is previous times we\u2019ve seen major levels similar to now have been closer to the beginning of bull markets than the end of bull markets,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; This is now one of the greatest surges off a major low ever. It is perfectly normal to see a drawdown of double digits after the initial surge weakens. This could be happening now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We\u2019ve shown that huge up months like April tend to eventually resolve higher, but some near-term weakness is possible.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Also, when more than 90% of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are above their 50-day moving average, this shows solid longer-term results. Again, suggesting that very overbought isn\u2019t always a bad thing.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; There was a huge spike in stocks marking new monthly highs, again historically an overbought signal. This opens the door for some near-term weakness, but is a very positive sign longer-term.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Last, in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 was recently more than 13% above the 50-day moving average, one of the highest levels ever. The good news is one-year later stocks were higher every single time. Yet another clue that historically overbought isn\u2019t always a bad thing for the bulls.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; A record run, over-the-top excitement from small traders, the Nasdaq at 10,000, historically high multiples, and seasonality all could be a factor in why a pullback here could be perfectly normal. In fact, if you are bullish, after a 45% rally, one of the best things would be for prices to reset some here over the coming months. We would be a buyer of weakness and use it as an opportunity for longer-term price appreciation.\n\n*****\n\n# Persistent Volatility Runs Into Resistance &amp; Exuberant Sentiment\n\n&gt; We have all been gobsmacked by velocity and strength of this V-shaped rally off the March 23 bear market low. For the record this rally became an official Ned Davis Research defined bull market on May 26 when DJIA was up 30% from the low when it made a new recovery high after 50 calendar days (see NDR definitions below). And this was on the back of the shortest bear market on record, which lasted only 40 days. Today\u2019s market comeuppance is an important reminder that we need to be patient with this market and heed our cautious analysis and stance.\n\n&gt; This is still the \u201cWorst Six Months\u201d and as we warned in the May Outlook when the market is down during the \u201cBest Six Months\u201d (November-April) as they were in 2020, the \u201cWorst Six Months\u201d (May-October) were down or flat 86% of the time with a median S&amp;P decline of -6.7% since 1950.\n\n&gt; Other seasonal indicators are also flashing the caution sign. This year\u2019s negative January Barometer and breached December DJIA low, point to possible retests of the lows and choppy, volatile trading over the next several months. See the updated composite graph of the seasonal pattern for these 22 years since 1950 in the June Outlook.\n\n&gt; It appears that quite a fair amount of hope was built into the rally. Lots of hope that everything is just going back to the way it was real soon. But COVID cases are on the climb again and folks are concerned that a pause and/or reverse of reopening could delay the economic recovery and derail the bull. Up until the past few days it felt like mid-February again with the market ignoring economic and corporate data as momentum pushed everything higher.\n\n&gt; The jobs report was a bit unbelievable and then Fed Chairman Powell\u2019s candor and reserved outlook at yesterday\u2019s press conference put the fear right back into the market today. Meanwhile the Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDPNow model currently estimates that 2020 Q2 GDP growth will be down -48.5%.\n\n&gt; Sentiment had also become rather exuberant as the Weekly CBOE Equity Only Put/Call ratio we track in the \u201cPulse of the Market\u201d hit 0.43 last week \u2013 its lowest level since the week ending 4/10/2010 about three weeks before the infamous flash crash. Investor\u2019s Intelligence Advisors Sentiment survey Bullish advisors are now up to 56.9%. Correction advisors are down to 22.5% while Bearish advisors have slipped further to 20.6%, putting us at caution levels.\n\n&gt; Technically, things deteriorated rapidly today. After blasting through several levels of resistance we have been tracking as shown in the chart here S&amp;P 500 stalled at 3210 and plunged 5.9% today through 3115 support/resistance and closed just below 3010 support/resistance which sits at the 2019 summer highs. The next major support level below here is 2725 right near where the 50-day moving average turned up in mid-May, which would be a 15.7% correction from the recent recovery high reached this past Monday, June 8.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7d877af1643a7342c0c8622cbc763c92/eb566818257f08b5-2b/s500x750/8228cad8989a5456266c3f0d753168c4d3c3efec.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Ned Davis Research bull and bear market definitions:\n\n&gt; A cyclical bull market requires a 30% rise in the DJIA after 50 calendar days or a 13% rise after 155 calendar days. Reversals of 30% in the Value Line Geometric Index since 1965 also qualify. A cyclical bear market requires a 30% drop in the DJIA after 50 calendar days or a 13% decline after 145 calendar days. Reversals in the Value Line Geometric Index also qualify. Bull and bear markets are measured at peak and trough dates, so both the time and price criteria must be met as of the peak and trough dates.\n\n*****\n\n# More Volatility Likely During June Options Expiration Week and Beyond\n\n&gt; The second Triple Witching Week (Quadruple Witching if you prefer) of the year brings on some volatile trading with losses frequently exceeding gains. NASDAQ has the weakest record on the first trading day of the week. Triple-Witching Friday is usually better, DJIA has been up ten of the last seventeen years.\n\n&gt; Full-week performance is choppy as well, littered with greater than 1% moves in both directions. The week after Triple-Witching Day is horrendous. This week has experienced DJIA losses in 26 of the last 30 years with an average decline of 1.07%. S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have fared slightly better during the week after over the same 30-year span, declining 0.72% and 0.23% respectively on average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cbdc17aecf40cbf412100049a35e7f1b/4c6fa6c95e723529-93/s500x750/0bd7385e1b398b3c223892fe86cd1886d41bc9fd.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8de0bdcd706b729d7e5ebe8fd92670b9/4c6fa6c95e723529-e7/s500x750/fa1a12f3de57328b97c1f4f5a274d24e94fd19de.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/09c9ca9d3a0502b4a8d97976bd73366e/4c6fa6c95e723529-cf/s500x750/498b4d398dde04ebb764b72d962aa53378b29260.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$KR** \n&gt; * **$MFA** \n&gt; * **$GRPN** \n&gt; * **$JKS** \n&gt; * **$ORCL** \n&gt; * **$LEN** \n&gt; * **$KMX** \n&gt; * **$TSQ** \n&gt; * **$HRB** \n&gt; * **$MPAA** \n&gt; * **$SWBI** \n&gt; * **$CMC** \n&gt; * **$RGS** \n&gt; * **$TTM** \n&gt; * **$HOME** \n&gt; * **$JBL** \n&gt; * **$DBI** \n&gt; * **$AMSWA** \n&gt; * **$ABM** \n&gt; * **$BNGO** \n&gt; * **$CNTG** \n&gt; * **$LMB** \n&gt; * **$LIVX** \n&gt; * **$ALYA** \n&gt; * **$GAN** \n&gt; * **$INWK** \n&gt; * **$VOLT** \n&gt; * **$UROV** \n&gt; * **$VNCE**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/vM5brmK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/l3jztzJ.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.15.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/shKM8RG.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.16.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PYffarr.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0uE8QeB.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/bNd3sxx.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HdpyR9B.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.18.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DNsufe6.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.19.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FHBG6yj.png))\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.19.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Kroger Co. $32.26\n&gt; **Kroger Co.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 15th, 2020.\n\n# **After big sell-off, stock market will be wary of virus and Fed testimony in week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/12/after-big-sell-off-stock-market-will-be-wary-of-virus-and-fed-testimony-in-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to reassure markets next week the central bank will do whatever it takes to help the economy heal. That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks could be caught in a tug-of-war in the week ahead, as investors weigh the potential positives of a reopening economy against worry that the coronavirus continues to spread. \n*****\n&gt; In the past week, the S&amp;P 500\u2032s sharp gains briefly drove the index into positive territory for the year, before a bruising sell-off at the end of the week. Stocks were more than 47% above the March 23 low before investors got spooked by signs the coronavirus is picking up in some areas. \n*****\n&gt; The Fed also dampened sentiment when it released economic forecasts Wednesday that showed a slow recovery and interest rates at zero through the end of 2022. Investors will hear more of the same when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks before Congress this Tuesday and Wednesday in his semi-annual economic testimony. He may provide more clarity on the Fed\u2019s bond buying and other policy moves.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales for May are released Tuesday, and that will be an important look at consumer spending activity. It is the most important data in the coming week, other than the weekly jobless claims report on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks rose on Friday with the S&amp;P 500 up more than 1% after Thursday\u2019s sharp sell-off that sent the index down nearly 6%. Treasury yields, which move opposite price, also moved sharply lower as investors moved to the safety of bonds. The 10-year yield was back to 0.70%,  well off the high of 0.95% in the week earlier.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve been overbought for awhile and digesting gains would be natural,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said the fact that 97% of the S&amp;P 500 companies\u2019 stocks were above their 50-day moving average this past week was a warning. The 50-day moving average is a momentum indicator, and if a stock or index rises above it, it is usually a positive, but if they all do, it\u2019s a contrarian warning.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cHistorically that\u2019s just too high ... and also the P/E on the S&amp;P was 25.1 of forward 12-months earnings, which is a 52% premium to the P/E average since 2000,\u201d he said. The P/E, or the price-to-earnings ratio, is an important tool to value stocks, and it averages around 16.5 times.\n*****\n&gt; In the sell-off, stocks that would benefit from the economy\u2019s reopening were the hardest hit. Investors had been jumping into those names, driving them higher at a dizzying pace. They were also the sectors that were last to join the rally, like banks, casinos, airlines and hotels.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOnce the pullback runs its course I think investors will move back again into the sectors and subsectors that were most beaten up in the bear market,\u201d said Stovall.  \n*****\n&gt; Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com, said he lightened up his holdings earlier in the week. \u201cThere were some clues early in the week that the market was vulnerable, like when the S&amp;P closed below 3,191 on Tuesday. You had some feverish trading in some of the very speculative names,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said other headwinds hang over the market, and one big one is the upcoming presidential election, which could become a bigger influence on the market. RealClearPolitics has President Donald Trump trailing former Vice President Joseph Biden by 8.1 points in the latest average of polls.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cTrump\u2019s numbers are just looking so bad, and if the Fed needs to keep interest rates at zero and we have the potential for a resurgence in Covid cases, then Trump is not going to benefit from an economic recovery, and as a result, that gives Biden a better chance of being elected,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily that the market dislikes Biden, but they dislike uncertainty. And a decline in equity prices would be representative of that uncertainty.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Consumer barometer\n&gt; Retail sales are typically a barometer for consumer spending, and when Americans were shut in their homes they did much less shopping than usual. April data showed a 16.7% drop in sales, but consumers did spend online.\n*****\n&gt; Economists are watching Tuesday\u2019s report on May sales closely, particularly after the May jobs report had a large upside surprise. There were 2.5 million jobs added in May, instead of an expected loss of 8.3 million.\n*****\n&gt; Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, said business-to-business spending data for May implies that retail sales were flat compared with April\u2019s depressed level and could be down 22% from a year ago.\n*****\n&gt; Zandi used data from Cortera, which collects information on about $1.5 trillion in business-to-business spending. In an analysis of spending by retailers in May, it found there were gains from April in some categories, including furniture, gasoline stations and restaurants.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cClothing and sporting goods store sales have been crushed, and that continued in May.  Restaurants,  gasoline stations and furniture stores have been hit hard, but showed strong improvement in May. Food and health and personal care stores have done well through the crisis, but gave some of that back in May,\u201d notes Zandi. \u201cOnline retailers, general merchandise stores (which includes WalMart and Target), and building material and garden supply stores (Home Depot and Lowes) have navigated the crisis well, and May was another solid month.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Zandi said weakness in apparel and sporting goods washed out the gains in other areas.\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead \n&gt; Strategists said Powell did not surprise the market with his comments this past week, but his sober approach reminded investors that the Fed policy will have to be in place for a very long time to pull the economy out of its deep rut. That will keep markets on high alert during his two days of testimony.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the cat\u2019s out of the bag. I don\u2019t think he can sugarcoat it. The thing he\u2019s got to worry about is he needs help. He needs Congress and the administration to come up with another fiscal rescue package. He can\u2019t do it on his own,\u201d said Zandi. \u201cHe has to keep the pressure on them and get a piece of legislation before they go on August recess.  ... He\u2019s speaking as much to the American people as he is to the policy makers.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Zandi said the Fed has acted aggressively and swiftly to unfreeze credit markets when they locked up in March, but the economy needs more stimulus ahead of a wave of potential business defaults and with a high level of unemployment. The Fed\u2019s balance sheet has ballooned to $7.2 trillion, and on Wednesday the central bank committed to monthly purchases of $80 billion in Treasury securities and $40 billion in mortgage securities.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think he continues to lay the foundation for policy changes to come,\u201d  said Zandi. \u201cHe\u2019s strongly suggesting there\u2019s going to be more monetary support, and that would come in the form of a few things - it would be performance dependent forward guidance. ... He\u2019s going to make it clear until the economy is at full employment and inflation is at least at target, if not above.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Zandi said Powell may discuss yield curve controls, which would mean the Fed would set targets for interest rate levels in the Treasury market, and make purchases to influence rates. Some economists believe the Fed  will adopt that tool before the end of the year.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think he\u2019s going to more clearly define the amount of QE they\u2019re doing going forward. He\u2019ll try to preserve some optionality, but he\u2019ll try to make it known, they\u2019re buying a lot of bonds for a long time to come,\u201d Zandi said.\n*****\n&gt; But the hearings could be more politicized, and Powell may be criticized by Congress for helping financial markets more than Main Street, said John Briggs, head of strategy at NatWest Markets. \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if there\u2019s a lot new, given it comes on the heels of the FOMC meeting,\u201d Briggs said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/pw0CUi2.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/fP1CK0o.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/UO6j0gC.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/GImgVgH.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JYCJeEm.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qcLni34.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/iC1YmSV.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qsph2Sm.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vM5brmK.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/LscP3vHv/ipos12.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/1Y2bHjI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/hrsZdEH.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Is This The Start Of A New Bear Market?\n\n&gt; \u201cStocks take an escalator up, but an elevator down.\u201d \u2014 Old investment axiom\n\n&gt; The saying above sure happened yesterday. In the end, the S&amp;P 500 Index fell 5.9% for the worst day since March 16 and the first three-day losing streak in more than three months. What does it mean? We\u2019ve been on record that we expect some type of well-deserved pullback or at least consolidation after the 45% bounce off of the March 23 lows and the best 50-day rally ever. Then add in the fact that June has been the worst month of the year for stocks since 2000 and some type of weakness is perfectly logical here and now.\n\n&gt; \u201cIn many ways, this is one of the most overbought stock markets we\u2019ve ever seen. Now the catch to this is previous times we\u2019ve seen major levels similar to now have been closer to the beginning of bull markets than the end of bull markets,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; This is now one of the greatest surges off a major low ever. It is perfectly normal to see a drawdown of double digits after the initial surge weakens. This could be happening now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We\u2019ve shown that huge up months like April tend to eventually resolve higher, but some near-term weakness is possible.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Also, when more than 90% of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are above their 50-day moving average, this shows solid longer-term results. Again, suggesting that very overbought isn\u2019t always a bad thing.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; There was a huge spike in stocks marking new monthly highs, again historically an overbought signal. This opens the door for some near-term weakness, but is a very positive sign longer-term.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Last, in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 was recently more than 13% above the 50-day moving average, one of the highest levels ever. The good news is one-year later stocks were higher every single time. Yet another clue that historically overbought isn\u2019t always a bad thing for the bulls.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; A record run, over-the-top excitement from small traders, the Nasdaq at 10,000, historically high multiples, and seasonality all could be a factor in why a pullback here could be perfectly normal. In fact, if you are bullish, after a 45% rally, one of the best things would be for prices to reset some here over the coming months. We would be a buyer of weakness and use it as an opportunity for longer-term price appreciation.\n\n*****\n\n# Persistent Volatility Runs Into Resistance &amp; Exuberant Sentiment\n\n&gt; We have all been gobsmacked by velocity and strength of this V-shaped rally off the March 23 bear market low. For the record this rally became an official Ned Davis Research defined bull market on May 26 when DJIA was up 30% from the low when it made a new recovery high after 50 calendar days (see NDR definitions below). And this was on the back of the shortest bear market on record, which lasted only 40 days. Today\u2019s market comeuppance is an important reminder that we need to be patient with this market and heed our cautious analysis and stance.\n\n&gt; This is still the \u201cWorst Six Months\u201d and as we warned in the May Outlook when the market is down during the \u201cBest Six Months\u201d (November-April) as they were in 2020, the \u201cWorst Six Months\u201d (May-October) were down or flat 86% of the time with a median S&amp;P decline of -6.7% since 1950.\n\n&gt; Other seasonal indicators are also flashing the caution sign. This year\u2019s negative January Barometer and breached December DJIA low, point to possible retests of the lows and choppy, volatile trading over the next several months. See the updated composite graph of the seasonal pattern for these 22 years since 1950 in the June Outlook.\n\n&gt; It appears that quite a fair amount of hope was built into the rally. Lots of hope that everything is just going back to the way it was real soon. But COVID cases are on the climb again and folks are concerned that a pause and/or reverse of reopening could delay the economic recovery and derail the bull. Up until the past few days it felt like mid-February again with the market ignoring economic and corporate data as momentum pushed everything higher.\n\n&gt; The jobs report was a bit unbelievable and then Fed Chairman Powell\u2019s candor and reserved outlook at yesterday\u2019s press conference put the fear right back into the market today. Meanwhile the Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDPNow model currently estimates that 2020 Q2 GDP growth will be down -48.5%.\n\n&gt; Sentiment had also become rather exuberant as the Weekly CBOE Equity Only Put/Call ratio we track in the \u201cPulse of the Market\u201d hit 0.43 last week \u2013 its lowest level since the week ending 4/10/2010 about three weeks before the infamous flash crash. Investor\u2019s Intelligence Advisors Sentiment survey Bullish advisors are now up to 56.9%. Correction advisors are down to 22.5% while Bearish advisors have slipped further to 20.6%, putting us at caution levels.\n\n&gt; Technically, things deteriorated rapidly today. After blasting through several levels of resistance we have been tracking as shown in the chart here S&amp;P 500 stalled at 3210 and plunged 5.9% today through 3115 support/resistance and closed just below 3010 support/resistance which sits at the 2019 summer highs. The next major support level below here is 2725 right near where the 50-day moving average turned up in mid-May, which would be a 15.7% correction from the recent recovery high reached this past Monday, June 8.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7d877af1643a7342c0c8622cbc763c92/eb566818257f08b5-2b/s500x750/8228cad8989a5456266c3f0d753168c4d3c3efec.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Ned Davis Research bull and bear market definitions:\n\n&gt; A cyclical bull market requires a 30% rise in the DJIA after 50 calendar days or a 13% rise after 155 calendar days. Reversals of 30% in the Value Line Geometric Index since 1965 also qualify. A cyclical bear market requires a 30% drop in the DJIA after 50 calendar days or a 13% decline after 145 calendar days. Reversals in the Value Line Geometric Index also qualify. Bull and bear markets are measured at peak and trough dates, so both the time and price criteria must be met as of the peak and trough dates.\n\n*****\n\n# More Volatility Likely During June Options Expiration Week and Beyond\n\n&gt; The second Triple Witching Week (Quadruple Witching if you prefer) of the year brings on some volatile trading with losses frequently exceeding gains. NASDAQ has the weakest record on the first trading day of the week. Triple-Witching Friday is usually better, DJIA has been up ten of the last seventeen years.\n\n&gt; Full-week performance is choppy as well, littered with greater than 1% moves in both directions. The week after Triple-Witching Day is horrendous. This week has experienced DJIA losses in 26 of the last 30 years with an average decline of 1.07%. S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have fared slightly better during the week after over the same 30-year span, declining 0.72% and 0.23% respectively on average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cbdc17aecf40cbf412100049a35e7f1b/4c6fa6c95e723529-93/s500x750/0bd7385e1b398b3c223892fe86cd1886d41bc9fd.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8de0bdcd706b729d7e5ebe8fd92670b9/4c6fa6c95e723529-e7/s500x750/fa1a12f3de57328b97c1f4f5a274d24e94fd19de.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/09c9ca9d3a0502b4a8d97976bd73366e/4c6fa6c95e723529-cf/s500x750/498b4d398dde04ebb764b72d962aa53378b29260.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending June 12th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Vn8EIUmbU))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 6.14.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w2a_gQvLdg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$KR** \n&gt; * **$MFA** \n&gt; * **$GRPN** \n&gt; * **$JKS** \n&gt; * **$ORCL** \n&gt; * **$LEN** \n&gt; * **$KMX** \n&gt; * **$TSQ** \n&gt; * **$HRB** \n&gt; * **$MPAA** \n&gt; * **$SWBI** \n&gt; * **$CMC** \n&gt; * **$RGS** \n&gt; * **$TTM** \n&gt; * **$HOME** \n&gt; * **$JBL** \n&gt; * **$DBI** \n&gt; * **$AMSWA** \n&gt; * **$ABM** \n&gt; * **$BNGO** \n&gt; * **$CNTG** \n&gt; * **$LMB** \n&gt; * **$LIVX** \n&gt; * **$ALYA** \n&gt; * **$GAN** \n&gt; * **$INWK** \n&gt; * **$VOLT** \n&gt; * **$UROV** \n&gt; * **$VNCE**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/vM5brmK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/l3jztzJ.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.15.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/shKM8RG.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.16.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PYffarr.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0uE8QeB.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/bNd3sxx.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HdpyR9B.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.18.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DNsufe6.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.19.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FHBG6yj.png))\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.19.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Kroger Co. $32.26\n&gt; **Kroger Co.

        "selftext": "The Oracle of Omaha has a reputation as the gentle GOAT, but is there more to this than meets the eye?\n\nIs there something that is often overlooked?\n\nOr is this reputation warranted? (get it...warren, warranted?)\n\nAnyway...Let's begin...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe story begins in 1942, when Warren Buffet bought his first shares at the age of just 11. \n\nThis is same year that his father Howard Buffett ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in the Nebraska district.\n\nHe won, and became a member of Congress in 1943.\n\nBefore this, Howard worked at a small stock brokerage firm.\n\nHe was reelected twice. However, in 1952, he decided against seeking another term and returned to his investment business in Omaha,\u00a0Buffett-Falk &amp; Co., where he worked until shortly before his death in 1964.\n\nBut what about Warren Buffett?\n\nIn 1951, after graduating from Columbia, where he was taught by Benjamin Graham, Buffett worked for three years at his father's firm as an investment salesman. \n\nIn 1954, Buffett accepted a job at Benjamin Graham's partnership, working as a securities analyst.\n\nHis starting salary was $12,000 a year - the equivalent of $114,000 today.\n\nHowever, just two years later, Graham retired and Buffett started his own investment partnership.\n\nHe went to his father's acquaintances to raise Capital for his first fund. \n\nThese were prominent families in Nebraska with big businesses and political connections.\n\nFor example, across the street was the family whose son became the CEO of Coca Cola - that family gave him $10,000.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn 2012, the STOCK Act or The Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act was signed into law.\u00a0 \n\nThe law prohibits the use of non-public information for private profit, including insider trading by members of Congress and other government employees.\n\nRemember, Buffett's father used to be in Congress.\n\n***The only people who were, before 2012, allowed to trade on insider information without having criminal charges brought against them were congressmen.***\n\nRemember, Buffett's father was a stock market broker prior to being elected and going to Congress, hence he had a comprehensive knowledge of the stock market and clearly had an interest in it. \n\nAfter all, it was his father who taught Buffett the ropes early on and had him buy his first shares as an eleven year old.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImagine you are Warren Buffett, and you can:\n\n1). Get insider information to trade on it;\n\n2). Get a six-figure position after College;\n\n3). After a few years, set up your own fund, getting money from wealthy family friends;\n\n4). Pay no dividends to investors and only put a hundred bucks of your own money into the fund;\n\n5). Let the mathematics of compounding work its magic as you bring in more institutional money;\n\n6). Become so connected Politically and connected on Wall Street that you can get special deals, which have practically no risk as you know bailouts are coming. For example, in the 2008 crisis, Berkshire owned stock valued at more than $13 billion in the top recipients of the TARP funds, and Berkshire had at least twice as much dependence on bailed-out banks as any other large investor;\n\n7). Have billions of dollars on hand, remember you aren't paying any dividends to investors, ready for the inevitable economic recession to hit so that you can sweep up cheap assets;\n\n8). Be holier-than-thou (i.e. calling derivatives \"financial weapons of mass destruction\" when, during the height of the 2008 crisis, Berkshire sold more than $2.5 billion worth of credit default swaps. OR what about Buffett's reputation as the saviour in the Great Recession when Berkshire is the majority owner of Moody's, who played a key role in inflating the crisis in 2008 - via their questionable debt and derivative ratings which inflated the mortgage and subprime market).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat about Buffett's status as the GOAT?\n\n[Jim Simons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcy8QaILDJI) has a far superior track record.\n\nBillionaire Chamath Palihapitiya has even stated that [Jeff Bezos is the best investor of our generation](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/12/chamath-palihapitiya-amazons-jeff-bezos-the-best-investor-better-than-warren-buffett.html#:~:text=Chamath%20Palihapitiya%20calls%20Amazon's%20Jeff%20Bezos,investor%2C%20better%20than%20Warren%20Buffett&amp;text=%E2%80%9CPeople%20used%20to%20lambaste%20Jeff,said%20on%20%E2%80%9CSquawk%20Box.%E2%80%9D), not Warren Buffett.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBuffett has missed out on an entire raft of tech and Berkshire has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 in recent years.\n\nBerkshire's best years are found overwhelmingly in the period before the tech era.\n\nAlso, he has been critical of Bitcoin, describing it as \"rat poison squared\"\n\nUltimately, Buffett is worth $73 billion, he doesn't need to have an in-depth understanding of new age tech.\n\nMoreover, Buffett has a huge stake in Finance 1.0, why would he give props to Finance 2.0?\n\nBitcoin as a savings vehicle is misaligned with Berkshire's don't-save-money-invest-it-in-us or consume more of the products of the businesses that Berkshire has a huge stake in, and is also misaligned with Berkshire's Cantillon insider advantages.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's worth noting that Howard Buffett strongly supported the gold standard because he believed it would limit the ability of government to inflate the money supply and spend beyond its means. Here is a direct quote from Howard:\n\n***\"I warn you that politicians of both parties will oppose the restoration of gold, although they may outwardly seemingly favor it,\u00a0unless you are willing to surrender your children and your country to galloping inflation, war and slavery\u00a0then this cause demands your support. For if human liberty is to survive in America, we must win the battle to restore honest money. There is no more important challenge facing us than this issue -- the restoration of your freedom to secure gold in exchange for the fruits of your labors.\"***\n\nHis son Warren, however, hates gold. See the [Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs) as to why.\n\n**Some have even argued that Buffett's success can be summarised by the following:**\n\n**First Deals = Insider Information**\n\n**Last Deals = Cantillon Effect**\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nIs it true... or false?\n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UpTUBgUYgc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UpTUBgUYgc)",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 15th, 2020.\n\n# **After big sell-off, stock market will be wary of virus and Fed testimony in week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/12/after-big-sell-off-stock-market-will-be-wary-of-virus-and-fed-testimony-in-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to reassure markets next week the central bank will do whatever it takes to help the economy heal. That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks could be caught in a tug-of-war in the week ahead, as investors weigh the potential positives of a reopening economy against worry that the coronavirus continues to spread. \n*****\n&gt; In the past week, the S&amp;P 500\u2032s sharp gains briefly drove the index into positive territory for the year, before a bruising sell-off at the end of the week. Stocks were more than 47% above the March 23 low before investors got spooked by signs the coronavirus is picking up in some areas. \n*****\n&gt; The Fed also dampened sentiment when it released economic forecasts Wednesday that showed a slow recovery and interest rates at zero through the end of 2022. Investors will hear more of the same when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks before Congress this Tuesday and Wednesday in his semi-annual economic testimony. He may provide more clarity on the Fed\u2019s bond buying and other policy moves.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales for May are released Tuesday, and that will be an important look at consumer spending activity. It is the most important data in the coming week, other than the weekly jobless claims report on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks rose on Friday with the S&amp;P 500 up more than 1% after Thursday\u2019s sharp sell-off that sent the index down nearly 6%. Treasury yields, which move opposite price, also moved sharply lower as investors moved to the safety of bonds. The 10-year yield was back to 0.70%,  well off the high of 0.95% in the week earlier.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve been overbought for awhile and digesting gains would be natural,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said the fact that 97% of the S&amp;P 500 companies\u2019 stocks were above their 50-day moving average this past week was a warning. The 50-day moving average is a momentum indicator, and if a stock or index rises above it, it is usually a positive, but if they all do, it\u2019s a contrarian warning.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cHistorically that\u2019s just too high ... and also the P/E on the S&amp;P was 25.1 of forward 12-months earnings, which is a 52% premium to the P/E average since 2000,\u201d he said. The P/E, or the price-to-earnings ratio, is an important tool to value stocks, and it averages around 16.5 times.\n*****\n&gt; In the sell-off, stocks that would benefit from the economy\u2019s reopening were the hardest hit. Investors had been jumping into those names, driving them higher at a dizzying pace. They were also the sectors that were last to join the rally, like banks, casinos, airlines and hotels.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOnce the pullback runs its course I think investors will move back again into the sectors and subsectors that were most beaten up in the bear market,\u201d said Stovall.  \n*****\n&gt; Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com, said he lightened up his holdings earlier in the week. \u201cThere were some clues early in the week that the market was vulnerable, like when the S&amp;P closed below 3,191 on Tuesday. You had some feverish trading in some of the very speculative names,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said other headwinds hang over the market, and one big one is the upcoming presidential election, which could become a bigger influence on the market. RealClearPolitics has President Donald Trump trailing former Vice President Joseph Biden by 8.1 points in the latest average of polls.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cTrump\u2019s numbers are just looking so bad, and if the Fed needs to keep interest rates at zero and we have the potential for a resurgence in Covid cases, then Trump is not going to benefit from an economic recovery, and as a result, that gives Biden a better chance of being elected,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily that the market dislikes Biden, but they dislike uncertainty. And a decline in equity prices would be representative of that uncertainty.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Consumer barometer\n&gt; Retail sales are typically a barometer for consumer spending, and when Americans were shut in their homes they did much less shopping than usual. April data showed a 16.7% drop in sales, but consumers did spend online.\n*****\n&gt; Economists are watching Tuesday\u2019s report on May sales closely, particularly after the May jobs report had a large upside surprise. There were 2.5 million jobs added in May, instead of an expected loss of 8.3 million.\n*****\n&gt; Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, said business-to-business spending data for May implies that retail sales were flat compared with April\u2019s depressed level and could be down 22% from a year ago.\n*****\n&gt; Zandi used data from Cortera, which collects information on about $1.5 trillion in business-to-business spending. In an analysis of spending by retailers in May, it found there were gains from April in some categories, including furniture, gasoline stations and restaurants.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cClothing and sporting goods store sales have been crushed, and that continued in May.  Restaurants,  gasoline stations and furniture stores have been hit hard, but showed strong improvement in May. Food and health and personal care stores have done well through the crisis, but gave some of that back in May,\u201d notes Zandi. \u201cOnline retailers, general merchandise stores (which includes WalMart and Target), and building material and garden supply stores (Home Depot and Lowes) have navigated the crisis well, and May was another solid month.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Zandi said weakness in apparel and sporting goods washed out the gains in other areas.\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead \n&gt; Strategists said Powell did not surprise the market with his comments this past week, but his sober approach reminded investors that the Fed policy will have to be in place for a very long time to pull the economy out of its deep rut. That will keep markets on high alert during his two days of testimony.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the cat\u2019s out of the bag. I don\u2019t think he can sugarcoat it. The thing he\u2019s got to worry about is he needs help. He needs Congress and the administration to come up with another fiscal rescue package. He can\u2019t do it on his own,\u201d said Zandi. \u201cHe has to keep the pressure on them and get a piece of legislation before they go on August recess.  ... He\u2019s speaking as much to the American people as he is to the policy makers.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Zandi said the Fed has acted aggressively and swiftly to unfreeze credit markets when they locked up in March, but the economy needs more stimulus ahead of a wave of potential business defaults and with a high level of unemployment. The Fed\u2019s balance sheet has ballooned to $7.2 trillion, and on Wednesday the central bank committed to monthly purchases of $80 billion in Treasury securities and $40 billion in mortgage securities.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think he continues to lay the foundation for policy changes to come,\u201d  said Zandi. \u201cHe\u2019s strongly suggesting there\u2019s going to be more monetary support, and that would come in the form of a few things - it would be performance dependent forward guidance. ... He\u2019s going to make it clear until the economy is at full employment and inflation is at least at target, if not above.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Zandi said Powell may discuss yield curve controls, which would mean the Fed would set targets for interest rate levels in the Treasury market, and make purchases to influence rates. Some economists believe the Fed  will adopt that tool before the end of the year.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think he\u2019s going to more clearly define the amount of QE they\u2019re doing going forward. He\u2019ll try to preserve some optionality, but he\u2019ll try to make it known, they\u2019re buying a lot of bonds for a long time to come,\u201d Zandi said.\n*****\n&gt; But the hearings could be more politicized, and Powell may be criticized by Congress for helping financial markets more than Main Street, said John Briggs, head of strategy at NatWest Markets. \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if there\u2019s a lot new, given it comes on the heels of the FOMC meeting,\u201d Briggs said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/pw0CUi2.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/fP1CK0o.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/UO6j0gC.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/GImgVgH.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JYCJeEm.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qcLni34.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/iC1YmSV.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qsph2Sm.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vM5brmK.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/LscP3vHv/ipos12.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/1Y2bHjI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/hrsZdEH.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Is This The Start Of A New Bear Market?\n\n&gt; \u201cStocks take an escalator up, but an elevator down.\u201d \u2014 Old investment axiom\n\n&gt; The saying above sure happened yesterday. In the end, the S&amp;P 500 Index fell 5.9% for the worst day since March 16 and the first three-day losing streak in more than three months. What does it mean? We\u2019ve been on record that we expect some type of well-deserved pullback or at least consolidation after the 45% bounce off of the March 23 lows and the best 50-day rally ever. Then add in the fact that June has been the worst month of the year for stocks since 2000 and some type of weakness is perfectly logical here and now.\n\n&gt; \u201cIn many ways, this is one of the most overbought stock markets we\u2019ve ever seen. Now the catch to this is previous times we\u2019ve seen major levels similar to now have been closer to the beginning of bull markets than the end of bull markets,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; This is now one of the greatest surges off a major low ever. It is perfectly normal to see a drawdown of double digits after the initial surge weakens. This could be happening now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We\u2019ve shown that huge up months like April tend to eventually resolve higher, but some near-term weakness is possible.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Also, when more than 90% of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are above their 50-day moving average, this shows solid longer-term results. Again, suggesting that very overbought isn\u2019t always a bad thing.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; There was a huge spike in stocks marking new monthly highs, again historically an overbought signal. This opens the door for some near-term weakness, but is a very positive sign longer-term.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Last, in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 was recently more than 13% above the 50-day moving average, one of the highest levels ever. The good news is one-year later stocks were higher every single time. Yet another clue that historically overbought isn\u2019t always a bad thing for the bulls.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; A record run, over-the-top excitement from small traders, the Nasdaq at 10,000, historically high multiples, and seasonality all could be a factor in why a pullback here could be perfectly normal. In fact, if you are bullish, after a 45% rally, one of the best things would be for prices to reset some here over the coming months. We would be a buyer of weakness and use it as an opportunity for longer-term price appreciation.\n\n*****\n\n# Persistent Volatility Runs Into Resistance &amp; Exuberant Sentiment\n\n&gt; We have all been gobsmacked by velocity and strength of this V-shaped rally off the March 23 bear market low. For the record this rally became an official Ned Davis Research defined bull market on May 26 when DJIA was up 30% from the low when it made a new recovery high after 50 calendar days (see NDR definitions below). And this was on the back of the shortest bear market on record, which lasted only 40 days. Today\u2019s market comeuppance is an important reminder that we need to be patient with this market and heed our cautious analysis and stance.\n\n&gt; This is still the \u201cWorst Six Months\u201d and as we warned in the May Outlook when the market is down during the \u201cBest Six Months\u201d (November-April) as they were in 2020, the \u201cWorst Six Months\u201d (May-October) were down or flat 86% of the time with a median S&amp;P decline of -6.7% since 1950.\n\n&gt; Other seasonal indicators are also flashing the caution sign. This year\u2019s negative January Barometer and breached December DJIA low, point to possible retests of the lows and choppy, volatile trading over the next several months. See the updated composite graph of the seasonal pattern for these 22 years since 1950 in the June Outlook.\n\n&gt; It appears that quite a fair amount of hope was built into the rally. Lots of hope that everything is just going back to the way it was real soon. But COVID cases are on the climb again and folks are concerned that a pause and/or reverse of reopening could delay the economic recovery and derail the bull. Up until the past few days it felt like mid-February again with the market ignoring economic and corporate data as momentum pushed everything higher.\n\n&gt; The jobs report was a bit unbelievable and then Fed Chairman Powell\u2019s candor and reserved outlook at yesterday\u2019s press conference put the fear right back into the market today. Meanwhile the Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDPNow model currently estimates that 2020 Q2 GDP growth will be down -48.5%.\n\n&gt; Sentiment had also become rather exuberant as the Weekly CBOE Equity Only Put/Call ratio we track in the \u201cPulse of the Market\u201d hit 0.43 last week \u2013 its lowest level since the week ending 4/10/2010 about three weeks before the infamous flash crash. Investor\u2019s Intelligence Advisors Sentiment survey Bullish advisors are now up to 56.9%. Correction advisors are down to 22.5% while Bearish advisors have slipped further to 20.6%, putting us at caution levels.\n\n&gt; Technically, things deteriorated rapidly today. After blasting through several levels of resistance we have been tracking as shown in the chart here S&amp;P 500 stalled at 3210 and plunged 5.9% today through 3115 support/resistance and closed just below 3010 support/resistance which sits at the 2019 summer highs. The next major support level below here is 2725 right near where the 50-day moving average turned up in mid-May, which would be a 15.7% correction from the recent recovery high reached this past Monday, June 8.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7d877af1643a7342c0c8622cbc763c92/eb566818257f08b5-2b/s500x750/8228cad8989a5456266c3f0d753168c4d3c3efec.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Ned Davis Research bull and bear market definitions:\n\n&gt; A cyclical bull market requires a 30% rise in the DJIA after 50 calendar days or a 13% rise after 155 calendar days. Reversals of 30% in the Value Line Geometric Index since 1965 also qualify. A cyclical bear market requires a 30% drop in the DJIA after 50 calendar days or a 13% decline after 145 calendar days. Reversals in the Value Line Geometric Index also qualify. Bull and bear markets are measured at peak and trough dates, so both the time and price criteria must be met as of the peak and trough dates.\n\n*****\n\n# More Volatility Likely During June Options Expiration Week and Beyond\n\n&gt; The second Triple Witching Week (Quadruple Witching if you prefer) of the year brings on some volatile trading with losses frequently exceeding gains. NASDAQ has the weakest record on the first trading day of the week. Triple-Witching Friday is usually better, DJIA has been up ten of the last seventeen years.\n\n&gt; Full-week performance is choppy as well, littered with greater than 1% moves in both directions. The week after Triple-Witching Day is horrendous. This week has experienced DJIA losses in 26 of the last 30 years with an average decline of 1.07%. S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have fared slightly better during the week after over the same 30-year span, declining 0.72% and 0.23% respectively on average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cbdc17aecf40cbf412100049a35e7f1b/4c6fa6c95e723529-93/s500x750/0bd7385e1b398b3c223892fe86cd1886d41bc9fd.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8de0bdcd706b729d7e5ebe8fd92670b9/4c6fa6c95e723529-e7/s500x750/fa1a12f3de57328b97c1f4f5a274d24e94fd19de.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/09c9ca9d3a0502b4a8d97976bd73366e/4c6fa6c95e723529-cf/s500x750/498b4d398dde04ebb764b72d962aa53378b29260.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$KR** \n&gt; * **$MFA** \n&gt; * **$GRPN** \n&gt; * **$JKS** \n&gt; * **$ORCL** \n&gt; * **$LEN** \n&gt; * **$KMX** \n&gt; * **$TSQ** \n&gt; * **$HRB** \n&gt; * **$MPAA** \n&gt; * **$SWBI** \n&gt; * **$CMC** \n&gt; * **$RGS** \n&gt; * **$TTM** \n&gt; * **$HOME** \n&gt; * **$JBL** \n&gt; * **$DBI** \n&gt; * **$AMSWA** \n&gt; * **$ABM** \n&gt; * **$BNGO** \n&gt; * **$CNTG** \n&gt; * **$LMB** \n&gt; * **$LIVX** \n&gt; * **$ALYA** \n&gt; * **$GAN** \n&gt; * **$INWK** \n&gt; * **$VOLT** \n&gt; * **$UROV** \n&gt; * **$VNCE**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/vM5brmK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/l3jztzJ.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.15.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/shKM8RG.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.16.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PYffarr.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0uE8QeB.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/bNd3sxx.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HdpyR9B.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.18.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DNsufe6.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.19.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FHBG6yj.png))\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.19.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Kroger Co. $32.26\n&gt; **Kroger Co.

        "selftext": "The Oracle of Omaha has a reputation as the gentle GOAT, but is there more to this than meets the eye?\n\nIs there something that is often overlooked?\n\nOr is this reputation warranted? (get it...warren, warranted?)\n\nAnyway...Let's begin...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe story begins in 1942, when Warren Buffet bought his first shares at the age of just 11. \n\nThis is same year that his father Howard Buffett ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in the Nebraska district.\n\nHe won, and became a member of Congress in 1943.\n\nBefore this, Howard worked at a small stock brokerage firm.\n\nHe was reelected twice. However, in 1952, he decided against seeking another term and returned to his investment business in Omaha,\u00a0Buffett-Falk &amp; Co., where he worked until shortly before his death in 1964.\n\nBut what about Warren Buffett?\n\nIn 1951, after graduating from Columbia, where he was taught by Benjamin Graham, Buffett worked for three years at his father's firm as an investment salesman. \n\nIn 1954, Buffett accepted a job at Benjamin Graham's partnership, working as a securities analyst.\n\nHis starting salary was $12,000 a year - the equivalent of $114,000 today.\n\nHowever, just two years later, Graham retired and Buffett started his own investment partnership.\n\nHe went to his father's acquaintances to raise Capital for his first fund. \n\nThese were prominent families in Nebraska with big businesses and political connections.\n\nFor example, across the street was the family whose son became the CEO of Coca Cola - that family gave him $10,000.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn 2012, the STOCK Act or The Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act was signed into law.\u00a0 \n\nThe law prohibits the use of non-public information for private profit, including insider trading by members of Congress and other government employees.\n\nRemember, Buffett's father used to be in Congress.\n\n***The only people who were, before 2012, allowed to trade on insider information without having criminal charges brought against them were congressmen.***\n\nRemember, Buffett's father was a stock market broker prior to being elected and going to Congress, hence he had a comprehensive knowledge of the stock market and clearly had an interest in it. \n\nAfter all, it was his father who taught Buffett the ropes early on and had him buy his first shares as an eleven year old.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImagine you are Warren Buffett, and you can:\n\n1). Get insider information to trade on it;\n\n2). Get a six-figure position after College;\n\n3). After a few years, set up your own fund, getting money from wealthy family friends;\n\n4). Pay no dividends to investors and only put a hundred bucks of your own money into the fund;\n\n5). Let the mathematics of compounding work its magic as you bring in more institutional money;\n\n6). Become so connected Politically and connected on Wall Street that you can get special deals, which have practically no risk as you know bailouts are coming. For example, in the 2008 crisis, Berkshire owned stock valued at more than $13 billion in the top recipients of the TARP funds, and Berkshire had at least twice as much dependence on bailed-out banks as any other large investor;\n\n7). Have billions of dollars on hand, remember you aren't paying any dividends to investors, ready for the inevitable economic recession to hit so that you can sweep up cheap assets;\n\n8). Be holier-than-thou (i.e. calling derivatives \"financial weapons of mass destruction\" when, during the height of the 2008 crisis, Berkshire sold more than $2.5 billion worth of credit default swaps. OR what about Buffett's reputation as the saviour in the Great Recession when Berkshire is the majority owner of Moody's, who played a key role in inflating the crisis in 2008 - via their questionable debt and derivative ratings which inflated the mortgage and subprime market).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat about Buffett's status as the GOAT?\n\n[Jim Simons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcy8QaILDJI) has a far superior track record.\n\nBillionaire Chamath Palihapitiya has even stated that [Jeff Bezos is the best investor of our generation](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/12/chamath-palihapitiya-amazons-jeff-bezos-the-best-investor-better-than-warren-buffett.html#:~:text=Chamath%20Palihapitiya%20calls%20Amazon's%20Jeff%20Bezos,investor%2C%20better%20than%20Warren%20Buffett&amp;text=%E2%80%9CPeople%20used%20to%20lambaste%20Jeff,said%20on%20%E2%80%9CSquawk%20Box.%E2%80%9D), not Warren Buffett.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBuffett has missed out on an entire raft of tech and Berkshire has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 in recent years.\n\nBerkshire's best years are found overwhelmingly in the period before the tech era.\n\nAlso, he has been critical of Bitcoin, describing it as \"rat poison squared\"\n\nUltimately, Buffett is worth $73 billion, he doesn't need to have an in-depth understanding of new age tech.\n\nMoreover, Buffett has a huge stake in Finance 1.0, why would he give props to Finance 2.0?\n\nBitcoin as a savings vehicle is misaligned with Berkshire's don't-save-money-invest-it-in-us or consume more of the products of the businesses that Berkshire has a huge stake in, and is also misaligned with Berkshire's Cantillon insider advantages.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's worth noting that Howard Buffett strongly supported the gold standard because he believed it would limit the ability of government to inflate the money supply and spend beyond its means. Here is a direct quote from Howard:\n\n***\"I warn you that politicians of both parties will oppose the restoration of gold, although they may outwardly seemingly favor it,\u00a0unless you are willing to surrender your children and your country to galloping inflation, war and slavery\u00a0then this cause demands your support. For if human liberty is to survive in America, we must win the battle to restore honest money. There is no more important challenge facing us than this issue -- the restoration of your freedom to secure gold in exchange for the fruits of your labors.\"***\n\nHis son Warren, however, hates gold. See the [Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs) as to why.\n\n**Some have even argued that Buffett's success can be summarised by the following:**\n\n**First Deals = Insider Information**\n\n**Last Deals = Cantillon Effect**\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nIs it true... or false?\n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UpTUBgUYgc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UpTUBgUYgc)",

At 12:22 32,015 18 DEC 20 100C were bought for $11. It\u2019s odd to see the stock decline despite being 13x it\u2019s ADV and have such a high C/P ratio for the day. Most of the calls were bought at the ask. The one major transaction is skewing this percentage a bit \u2013 I\u2019d imagine retail traders followed this and mostly traded at the mid. I will likely invest in this stock tomorrow.**\n\n2.  ***Ticker: CNX \u2013 Short Play***\n\n**Spot Price** **:8.96 -.24, (-2.61%)**\n\n**Sector: Energy**  **Industry : OIL &amp; Gas E&amp;P**\n\n**Company Summary** (from Yahoo Finance)**:** CNX Resources Corporation, an independent oil and gas company, explores for, develops, and produces natural gas properties primarily in the Appalachian Basin. The company operates through two divisions, Exploration and Production (E&amp;P), and Midstream. The E&amp;P division produces pipeline quality natural gas primarily to gas wholesalers. This division owns rights to extract natural gas in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio from approximately 519,000 net Marcellus Shale acres; and 608,000 net acres of Utica Shale, as well as rights to extract natural gas from other shale and shallow oil and gas positions from approximately 981,700 in Illinois, Indiana, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia. It also owns rights to extract coalbed methane (CBM) in Virginia from approximately 308,000 net CBM acres, as well as 2,122,000 net CBM acres in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, and New Mexico. The Midstream division owns, operates, and develops natural gas gathering and other midstream energy assets in the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The company also offers gas gathering and water delivery solutions to third-parties. The company was formerly known as CONSOL Energy Inc. and changed its name to CNX Resources Corporation in November 2017. CNX Resources Corporation was founded in 1860 and is headquartered in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania.\n\n**Special Considerations** : None\n\n**Next Earnings Date**: 07/28/2020\n\n**Option Information :**\n\n**Today's Option Volume:** **18692.0**  **ADV:** **4026.0**  **Multiple of ADV:** **5.0**\n\n**Total Calls:** **317.0**   **Total Puts:** **18375.0**  **P/C Ratio:** **57.9%**\n\n**Calls at Ask:** **17.0%**  **Calls at Bid:** **63.0%**\n\n**Puts at Ask:** **32%**  **Puts at Bid:** **32%**\n\n**Notable Strikes : JUL 17 \u201920 10P, 9P, 8P all had significant volume ranging from 5.6-6.2k Two of these strikes are now in the money. There was very little OI on 9P and 8P.**\n\n**News : JUN 17 -** CNX Resources (CNX) initiated with an Outperform at BMO Capital Markets; tgt $13\n\n**My Impression : Shorting Oil and Gas in a depressed economy seems like a good bet. The potential upside in following this play is certainly dampened by two of the highest volume strikes being already in the money.**\n\n**CLASSIC UNUSUAL OPTIONS ACTIVITY \u2013**\n\nFor information on FSLY, AMD and others check out [www.noeticoptions.com](http://www.noeticoptions.com)\n\nUpcoming Events for tomorrow \u2013 Durable Good Orders, GDP, International Trade in Goods, Jobless Claims, Corporate Profits, Retail Inventories, Wholesale Inventories. These are all released at 8:30AM. I\u2019d expect tomorrow morning to be volatile.\n\nIPOS for Tomorrow - DDI\n\n\\*Notes \u2013\n\nI realize this is the second time FSLY has shown up on the Unusual Option Activity section this week. There weren\u2019t as many to choose from today but regardless, FSLY still fit all the criteria for the inclusion and I believe it was the best pick.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nDISCLAIMER \u2013 These are my observations that I have made at the end of each day and trades that I am considering placing or watching. I am not responsible for your financial losses if you follow any of these trades. As always, do your due diligence.",

        "selftext": "In this week's edition of DDDD (Data-Driven DD), we'll be exploring the most common way that investors calculate what a stock's actually worth, and then why this valuation method no longer anymore. Also, apparently mods disabled image uploads, so this post is going to be a bit hard to read since I rely a lot on visuals in them; please direct all your complaints to them.\n\n  \n*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so; look at what happened to all the SPY 220p 4/17 bag holders. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*\n\n# The Discounted Cash Flow Model\n\nThe DCF model is the most common model for valuing companies in finance, and hence the fair value of a stock. It\u2019s based on one simple principle: the value of a company is based on the ability of that company to generate cash flows in the future. This principle is used in virtually every other financial instruments, like bonds, and is also used to help aid capital expenditure decisions. This method of valuing a company became popular after the 1929 stock market crash, once the \u201cstonks\u00a0only go up\u201d mentality broke and investors started investing in equities based on value and returns rather than speculation, which drove much of the stock market in the 1920s, but this idea has been used as far back as ancient Egypt.\n\n**Time Value of Money**\n\nBefore looking into the math behind the DCF model, another principle needs to be understood - Time Value of Money. This is the principle that money today, or the Present Value, is worth more than money in the future, or Future Value. The difference in worth can be caused by many things, such as inflation, the interest rate of Treasuries (i.e. risk free rate), and risk of default. This difference of worth is calculated to some interest rate, r, which is then used to calculate the Present Value of some future cash flow.\n\n[Time Value of Money Formula](https://imgur.com/a/1DGJMFj)\n\n**Cost of Capital**\n\nIn the case of valuing a company, what would this rate be? Typically, the Weighted Average Cost of Capital, or WACC is used for this percentage.\n\n[WACC Formula](https://imgur.com/a/pBwR0xB)\n\nWACC in simple terms is the rate of return typically required to be paid by the company to shareholders and bondholders to raise capital from them. In this formula,\n\n*E is the market capitalization of all equity in the company*\n\n*D is the value of all debt in the company*\n\n*V = E+D*\n\n*Tc is the tax rate paid by the company*\n\n*Rd is the cost of debt, for simplicity let\u2019s say this is the average interest rate paid by the company for its outstanding debts*\n\n*Re is the cost of equity. The most common way of calculating this is the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), with the formula below*\n\n[Cost of Equity Formula](https://imgur.com/a/l8hRXa4)\n\nIn this formula,\n\nRf is the risk free rate, which is the interest rate an investor can receive when investing in some risk free asset, like a US treasury\n\n\u03b2 represents the volatility of a company\u2019s stock on the stock market; this value has its own complicated formula but this value can be usually found in most stock trading platforms\n\nRm is the long-term return of equity markets. Hence (Rm - Rf) is typically seen as the equity risk premium, which is the excess returns given by the stock market for taking on the risk of investing in equities rather than treasuries\n\n**Free Cash Flow**\n\nFree cash flow is typically reported as part of a public company\u2019s financial statements and hence can easily be discovered. Intuitively, it\u2019s the company\u2019s ability to generate cash from operations to pay back stock and bond holders, and is calculated by adding non-cash expenses (i.e. depreciation, amortization), subtracting capital expenditures, and adding increases in current assets - liabilities to the post-tax EBIT, or Earnings before Interest and Taxes.\n\n**Putting it all together**\n\n[Enterprise Value Formula](https://imgur.com/a/IXoFalW)\n\nWith all of these in mind, let\u2019s use them to calculate the Enterprise Value of a company. This is done by adding the sums of all future cash flows generated by the company, and discounting it by the weighted average cost of capital. Since a company can have a potentially perpetual stream of cash flows, and future cash flows beyond a few years becomes very unpredictable, we would instead only do this calculation for the first five years, and then add some \u201cTerminal Value\u201d of the company to represent how much the company would be worth by the end of that period, and discount that as well.\n\n[Terminal Value Formula](https://imgur.com/a/3dfSLS9)\n\nTo calculate this Terminal Value, we\u2019ll need to have some rate, g, which represents the \u201cgrowth rate\u201d of the company once it\u2019s mature and no longer growing rapidly (i.e. taking market share).\n\nOnce you add all of the discounted near-term cash flows and discounted Terminal Value, you now have the Enterprise Value. Once you have that, figuring out the fair value of all the equity in a company, or the market cap, is easy.\n\n**Fair Market Cap = Enterprise Value - Total Debt + Cash**\n\n# Where we are right now\n\nLet\u2019s see how recent events have changed the equation for equity valuations today compared to in January for the stock market overall.\n\n**Cost of Equity**\n\nRisk Free Rate - Looking at US Treasuries, this is this most obvious and well-known change in this equation, with yields plummeting from 1.5% from the start of the year to near 0% today.\n\n[Risk Free Rate Graph](https://imgur.com/a/LLcMoDC)\n\nMarket Risk Premium - This one is a bit complicated because it can\u2019t really be immediately calculated and is based largely on investor sentiment. Historically, market risk premium has been between 5% to 6% for the US stock market. This can easily change, however, based on economic and financial conditions. Right now, let\u2019s assume this has remained unchanged, but we\u2019ll get back to this later.\n\n**Cost of Capital**\n\nDebt - Corporate debt this year has exploded, with an [additional $1 Trillion raised by companies](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/29/corporations-raise-1-trillion-in-the-bond-market-after-fed-backstop-double-the-pace-of-last-year.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1591575861873000)\u00a0so far, more than double from last year at the same time of the year\n\nEquity - SPY started at this year at $325; As of time of writing, it\u2019s within 2% of this number\n\nCost of Debt - Despite skyrocketing bond yields in March as the economy experienced a liquidity crisis, bond yields have since stabilized, aided by the Fed backstop, and bonds yields are now at about the same levels as it was at the start of the year.\n\n[Bond Yields](https://imgur.com/a/wFITrco)\n\nSo assuming the risk premium being the same, compared to the start of the year, we have a slightly lower cost of equity from a lower risk free rate, roughly the same cost of debt, and having increased corporate debt, making the debt weigh more proportionally than before in our WACC. Since the cost of debt is usually slightly lower than the cost of equity, this provides a slight downwards pressure towards WACC as well. Thus, WACC has decreased by a small amount since January, due to increased debt levels and decreased risk free rates.\n\n**Free Cash Flow**\n\nFor most non-tech companies, the lockdown has severely hurt their cash flows, with many industries such as airlines burning billions of dollars per month. It\u2019s pretty hard to find up-to-date metrics of what free cash flow is for the S&amp;P500, so instead, I\u2019ll just use earnings as a proxy to make a very rough estimate of what it might look like. According to [one source](https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_051520.pdf) I found, Q1 saw the YoY decline of 14.6%, with an estimated 36% decline in earnings for Q2.\n\nWhat free cash flow looks like for the remainder of the year, and future years depends on two very fundamental questions.\n\nFirst, will there be a second wave of lockdowns later in the year? On one side of this, based on the history of similar pandemics and what most medical experts are saying, a second spike of cases is extremely likely to occur in the fall. On the other hand, the US population seemed to have stopped caring about the virus, and is currently distracted by other problems. It\u2019s unclear whether or not the US population will care enough to lock down the country once again when the second wave hits after being desensitized with the first wave. In fact the first wave never really stopped; the US just started pretending that the pandemic is over and it\u2019s time to go back to business as usual.\n\n[US Daily Cases](https://imgur.com/a/iVirLQ4)\n\n[Daily Cases for Italy; What \"flatten the curve\" actually looks like](https://imgur.com/a/fhaz2IR) \n\nThe second question, assuming the answer to the first question is \u201cNo\u201d, is what kind of recovery the US economy will see. According to [one source](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://conference-board.org/publications/Economic-Forecast-US&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1591575861874000), \u00a0\u201cV\u201d-shaped recovery will see earnings going back to normal as early as 2021. A \u201cU\u201d-shaped recovery, which will represent a recession, could see it take up until 2022 to return back to pre-COVID output levels. If we do see a second wave of lockdowns, then what might be seen is a \u201cW\u201d-shaped recovery, where we\u2019ll see a second steep decline in GDP, and prolong the recession and make it tougher to get towards a recovery as more businesses go bankrupt.\n\n[GDP Projections](https://imgur.com/a/jK78km1)\n\nMissing from this model is an \u201cL\u201d-shaped recovery, similar to what happened in Japan in the 1990s, and the US in the 1930s, which would represent a decade-long depression. This is what I personally believe would look like in [my long-term thesis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gqgwfg/dddd_cycles_and_human_history/), along with some of the most famous investors in the financial world, [like Ray Dalio](https://www.principles.com/the-changing-world-order/).\n\nBack to the DCF Model; we have an additional $1 Trillion of corporate debt. With a total market cap of $32 Trillion, the effect of this on the fair value of equities are negligible. With nearly the same market cap as in the beginning of the year, this would mean the market is pricing in the same Enterprise Value for the market as the start of the year. This implies either one of two things, based on the factors explained about\n\n1. The stock market has priced in a \u201cV\u201d-shaped recovery for earnings, with earnings and free cash flow beyond 2020 to remain unimpaired.\n2. The stock market has priced in a \u201cU\u201d-shaped recovery, but this is offset by a lower WACC as the market risk premium has significantly lowered. This can be caused by a few things, such as decreased perceived risk by investors of companies due to fiscal and monetary stimulus, and inflows of cash that was previously waiting in the sidelines (eg. retail investors), large international funds (eg. Saudi and Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth funds), and yield-seeking institutions as Treasury yields drop to 0%, with no prospect of a rate increase anytime soon.\n\n**Why Fundamentals Might Not Matter Anymore**\n\nThere\u2019s another thing that can explain the recent stock market movements other the reasons explained above of what the stock market was pricing in - a stock market bubble. This happens when speculation in the market overpowers fundamentals, and the money in the market is no longer investing for long-term, earnings-based gains, but rather trying to get short-term gains through speculation. In other words people throwing their money in the stock market aren\u2019t investing because they legitimately think the company has good fundamentals and will give a good return on their investment through earnings in the long term, but because they believe that stocks only go up, and hence they can make a quick buck by throwing some money in it and cashing out later and making money through capital gains. This is how every asset bubble starts, from the Dutch tulip-mania bubble, the English South Sea bubble, the 1920s stock market bubble, the dot com stock market bubble, and the real estate bubble in the 2000s.\n\nTo give an example to illustrate what\u2019s happening, let\u2019s look at one of the first major bankruptcies to have happened during the stock market crash - Whiting Petroleum (WLL). I\u2019ve previously covered WLL, but the most interesting part of it is the dislocation of the valuation of its stock and bonds.\n\nWLL [reached a bankruptcy agreement](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1255474/000119312520118310/d922194dex10.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1591575861876000)\u00a0with some of its key creditors on April 23. To be clear, this agreement has not been agreed upon with all its creditors and has yet to be approved by the court, and represents the best-case outcome for existing WLL shareholders; the court or creditors and reject this and demand better terms, or even worse, request to change the bankruptcy to a Chapter 7 and liquidate all the assets. The agreement was to restructure the corporation such that the bondholder will receive 97% of the restructured company\u2019s equity, and the remaining 3% will be given to existing shareholders and management.\n\nAs of this writing, the price for WLL bonds were all between $15 - $16.50.\n\n[Example WLL Bond Pricing](https://imgur.com/a/ktLeGQo)\n\nUsing this, we can calculate what the bond market is pricing the restructured WLL at; multiplying the market value of all the outstanding bonds by 97% would give you the implied price of it. From the most recent [10-Q](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc%3D/Archives/edgar/data/1255474/000125547420000011/wll-20200331x10q.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1591575861876000), the face value of all notes involved in the bankruptcy agreement is $2.4B. Using the highest bond price of $16.5, or 0.165% of face value, the implied market cap of the restructured WLL would be $2.4B \\* \u00a00.165% \\* 97% = $384M.\n\nWith 91M shares outstanding, this would mean the fair value of the old WLL shares would be $384M \\* 3% / 91M = $0.13. As of writing, the current share price is more than 10 times higher than this, at $1.38.\n\nHow could this be possible? It\u2019s because absolutely no one speculates with bonds, and bond prices are usually entirely grounded in fundamentals; people buying bonds buy it to hold onto it and not to sell it later at a higher price. The opposite is clearly happening with WLL stocks. Noone is buying WLL to receive a small stake in the reorganized corporation once the bankruptcy agreement clears in the best case; if an institution really wanted it, they would have just bought the bonds. Instead, people are buying these shares because they believe they can sell it shortly after for a higher price. This is what\u2019s going on in the stock market right now, which is how bubbles form.\n\n**Making Tendies in a Bubble**\n\nOkay, so you now believe, like me, that the stock market is now in a bubble, and has been in a [longer-term bubble for the last decade](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fzmlsv/spy_1125_150p/). Does this mean that I should sell all my long positions, buy puts, and short the market? Absolutely not. **Never short a bubble**. The whole idea of a bubble is that asset prices no longer reflect its intrinsic value, but is based on sentiment and speculation. Just because it\u2019s overvalued now doesn\u2019t mean it will immediately crash, and there\u2019s nothing stopping it from being even more overvalued in the near future; fundamentals aren\u2019t stopping it anymore. This has been the most clear the past week, with the first wave of COVID-19 cases never actually ending, bad vaccine news, and most US cities literally on fire, yet the stock market is skyrocketing for no apparent reason.\n\nInstead, my personal strategy is to play into this bubble, while holding a substantial amount of VIX calls as a hedge for when the stock market bubble eventually pops. I\u2019m holding VIX calls of multiple strike prices and expiry dates, mostly in Fall, since I personally believe the stock market will go back towards reality once more companies become insolvent (i.e. Fed can no longer help them), and a second spike in cases forces countries around the world to a second wave of lockdowns, as warned by most medical experts.\n\nIn the meanwhile, I\u2019ll be using Technical Analysis, which is most useful for markets on assets with no fundamentals and driven by pure sentiment, to drive my short-term and medium-term strategies. Some of you who have been following me for the past few weeks may know that my previous thesis revolved around SPY never breaking above 293 (+2%), which looked like it was going to happen until it didn\u2019t. This is because according to historical precedents, breaking above this level will bring SPY above the 62% retracement, and 200D EMA, and cause a 1W MACD crossover, which always resulted in a V-shaped recovery and new ATHs soon after. Of course, back then I believed fundamentals still mattered a bit and that this would not happen, but I was clearly wrong and it became clear we're in a short-term super-bubble within the longer-term bubble; SPY will be hitting new ATHs within the next few weeks.\n\nMy personal strategy for playing the bubble is the same as previous weeks, for those that have been following me - if the market is pricing in a V-shaped recovery, go long on the weakest and most beaten-down stocks that are not currently in bankruptcy, since those will be skyrocketing within the next few weeks as we see a rotation of capital from strong stocks like FAANG that have retraced back to their ATHs towards weak stocks, such as airlines, cruises, and banks. In other words, I'm literally inversing my strategy from a few months ago. Two weeks ago, some of these positions included CCL, JPM, and BA, which I entered into as soon as I saw their 1W MACD crossover, and have been doing phenomenally well last week. However, I have since exited BA and JPM and taken profit and rolled them into M, GE, WFC, and DAL, among other positions.\n\n[CCL, Daily](https://imgur.com/a/XZrR7kj)\n\n[BA, Daily](https://imgur.com/a/YXFkNji)\n\n[GE, Daily](https://imgur.com/a/RrZftMq)\n\n[DAL, Daily](https://imgur.com/a/7OrpvTa)\n\nMy strategy for these tickers\u00a0are simple - enter long positions (i.e. calls) as soon as they break the 24% retracement, which acted as a resistance for these industries until recently, and hence means that their stock price will skyrocket once it breaks it, and exit at the 50% retracements. BA and JPM have since hit these marks, so I exited. This week, I\u2019m holding calls from CCL, DAL, WFC, and GE, which has yet to have broken these levels. The market will probably need to consolidate next week because we\u2019ve had a lot of green days in a row, and it\u2019s getting pretty overbought, so I\u2019m not expecting these to print immediately. As I exit all of these positions and take profit, I\u2019ll be rolling half of the profits over towards more VIX calls for more hedging.\n\n# Live Updates\n\nAs always, I'll be posting some thoughts throughout the next few days in this thread below for people interested.\n\n6/7 8PM - Futures very green, especially /RTY, maybe the market is just gonna go for a 5th green day in a row with strong bullish momentum.",

        "selftext": "There seems to be a lot of misinformation around Electra Meccanica (SOLO)\u00a0 so I thought I would share my findings with the group.\n\nSOLO is based out of Vancouver, Canada, where I am from, and\u00a0 is co-founded by their COO/President Henry Reisner.\n\nHenry and his family started in the car Business in the 80s when they founded the company intermeccanica which created high quality Porsche speedster replicas. From my understanding Intermeccanica is still a separate company owned by the Reisner family but they are closely connected to SOLO.\u00a0\n\nThe replica Porsche company has been and still is extremely successful and the family has actually written a book about how they developed the company.\n\nI have actually met with Members of the Reisner family at the international Vancouver auto show where they had their SOLO vehicles on display. They are car people and mentioned how it was extremely important that car people would enjoy how their handles which makes sense with them being Porsche people.\n\nFrom what I understand they made a lot of money to start the company by selling electric versions of their porsche speedster which Bill gates is seen driving around in with Warren Buffet :o\n\nThe product that could potentially make this company\u2019s worth increase greatly is their 1 seater called the solo.\u00a0\n\nThe Single seater has been in small scale production in Asia already and they have a small fleet of those cars already built which can be seen in their Vancouver showroom.\u00a0\n\nAs many have heard their CEO is looking for a production plant in Arizona and other states and we have already seen what a fake press release of a new production plant can do.\n\nThe Largest risk to the company in the short term is IMO is the possibility of not securing a US production site as expected\n\nThe company also has value because to my understanding they are actually producing their own technology and electronics as they are scooping up Phd electrical engineers in the past few years and still are. Companies like rimac who have also developed tech like their received revenue by selling tech to larger car companies who need a fast way into electric cars which is a growing market.\n\nTLDR:\n\nPros:\n\n* Lots of preorders for single seater\u00a0\n* Established Electric Porsche speedster Line (w customers like bill gates and warren buffet )\n* Very likely to soon close on a production facility for Preorders\n* A press release of production facility will Bring us to the moon\n* Good proprietary technology\u00a0\n* Good Driving cars (They are actually car enthusiast not just a group of hippies)\n\nCons:\n\n* Possibility that they may fail to secure a production plant\u00a0\n* IN the long term when the Solo car comes out it may not be perceived well\n\nOverall I think this company is definitely a steal the short term as it should definitely at least reach it\u2019s pre covid levels of about $2.50 and  MUCH higher if they secure a production plant. This company Probably won't be the new tesla but I definitely think some good press about their cars once production starts could really push the company up to the moon\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nAlso if this gets on jay Lenos garage \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83c\udf19 \n(Had to have emojis in there)\n\nReferences:\n\nBuffet and Gates in car:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQWkNXr2ujI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQWkNXr2ujI)\n\nPre Orders:\n\n[https://electrameccanica.com/electra-meccanica-announces-vehicle-pre-orders-now-exceed-64000-units/](https://electrameccanica.com/electra-meccanica-announces-vehicle-pre-orders-now-exceed-64000-units/)\n\nProduction plans and car Info:\n\nhttps://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/\\_d6e0f90ec1740fc6d44522270bb3bc3f/electrameccanica/db/354/2669/pdf/SOLO+June+2020+Investor+Presentation.pdf\n\nInvestor site:\n\n[https://investors.electrameccanica.com](https://investors.electrameccanica.com/)",

        "selftext": "*TL/DR: I'm bearish because of the looming unemployment, the market is already overbought, the fed can't fix every part of the economy, and because of the political and social unrest this year already has and will continue to bring. Would love to hear and discuss counter arguments.*\n\nI've been hearing countless arguments, first from the bears that COVID was undoubtedly the start of the next Great Depression, then from the bulls that were laughing at the bears because J Powell cancelled the recession and the V shape recovery is looking pretty good.  So here we are, 3 months later and the market is heading back toward the all time highs of February.\n\nI can understand a lot of the bulls argument and the \"don't fight the fed\" mentality. Right now, there really isn't a better place to stash your money than stocks. However, if we really sit down and think about what has already happened and what is on the way for the rest of this year, I truly can't see this momentum going through 2020 and into 2021. I still have some individual positions that I will continue to hold, but I am considering putting a lot of money into an inverse S&amp;P500 ETF (SH, SDS, SPXU) and watching as the next year unfolds. My bear argument for the next year:  \n***1)*** ***Unemployment:*** Unemployment is currently sitting at 40 million Americans. Recent study from the University of Chicago ([here](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/20/most-americans-see-layoffs-as-temporary-but-research-shows-otherwise.html)) says that 42% of those people won't have jobs to come back to. Even being conservative on the study and assuming 25%...that is 6 million people permanently unemployed. \n\nEvery company and industry has had to learn to adapt to at home work for the last 3 months, and that's going to cause a lot of companies to take a look at what jobs are really necessary to function and likely leave lower skilled Americans without jobs.\n\n***2) Market was already overbought before COVID and still is:*** Pretty straightforward on this one, coming into 2020 the market was already seriously overbought after the 11 year bull run and was due for a correction. It got a massive correction, but now is right back into overbought territory. PE is 23 and Shiller PE is 28.73 (median is 15.78)...a correction at these levels seems likely even without COVID. Low interest rates have made stocks the only game in town which is why they are being flooded into, but that does not make a lot of these companies well-run businesses worthy of their current valuation. Balance sheets and cash flows matter, and eventually investors are going to expect to see earnings, and a lot of these high flying \"COVID stocks\" won't be able to provide them.\n\n  \n***3)*** ***\"Unlimited\" QE can only do so much:*** I know, don't fight the fed. The fed can print money, but it can't create demand and jobs. If my case about unemployment and overbought markets are even halfway true, the feds printing is only a band-aid that will eventually have to be taken off.\n\nWe also don't really have a great idea of what \"unlimited QE\" even really means or looks like. Does it mean infinite from a dollars scale and/or a time scale? Does this unlimited QE only apply to what the fed considers COVID related issues, or will they just have to keep printing like this in 5 years or 10 years for any decline? Essentially I feel like the market is being completely propped up by the Fed, but that printing cash doesn't actually generate demand and *genuine* cash flows for a company\n\n  \n***4) Political and Social Unrest:*** This is the one that everyone knows about and almost jokes about at this point. Another set of bad news and the market roars higher. How sustainable is it really?\n\nI believe that COVID alone was enough to drag down the market substantially...but we have so much more going on than just COVID. \n\nWe have a President of the #1 economy who blames COVID directly on the #2 economy in the world...which will almost guarantee there is no trade deal happening with China anytime soon. With COVID, Hong Kong, and Trump, the situation with China will only deteriorate as the years go on. \n\nWe have an election year with arguably the most controversial president of all time who is going to use all means necessary to win or defraud the election. Either Trump wins another 4 years and we trust him to rebuild us in a post-COVID world, or he loses and very likely creates what will certainly be a democratic crisis. How many people truly see him going away peacefully? All we need is a couple of close states and \"fake news, election fraud\" are all over his Twitter and Fox News and we have a genuine crisis on our hands. Can't imagine this November-January being pretty in either scenario.\n\nSocial unrest is here to stay. People are furious right now and the cities aren't just burning because of one thing (although police brutality toward African Americans is a MAJOR issue) but because of YEARS of mistreatment and a system that does not work. The system is rigged against those in the bottom, the wealth gap has been growing for years, and I feel that these protests, pushed further by Trump, is society's way of showing that this just isn't sustainable. The masses at the bottom are demanding a true change. I'm not sure if they're going to get it or not, but I'm pretty confident they won't between now and November.\n\nSo...all that being said...I'm shorting the market using inverse ETFs. Who agrees?",

After this report was released, Huawei attempted to obfuscate it's dealings with Skycom leading to another detailed report being released in March of 2013.  (The [2012 report](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-huawei-hp/exclusive-huawei-partner-offered-embargoed-hp-gear-to-iran-idUSBRE8BT0BF20121230) / [2013 report](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-huawei-skycom/exclusive-huawei-cfo-linked-to-firm-that-offered-hp-gear-to-iran-idUKBRE90U0CA20130131) respectively). \n\nIn response to the Reuters articles released in 2012 and 2013, several banks questioned Huawei about its relationship with Skycom. This included HSBC, where both Huawei and Skycom held bank accounts.\n\nIn the U.S. indictment, specifically, Meng is being charged for participating in fraud involving HSBC. But this was a point of contention since the representations she made weren't technically criminal under Canadian law, i.e. no sanctions. What was criminal, however, and what ultimately led to Meng being charged is the actual act of making fraudulent misrepresentations, which is criminal in both the U.S. and Canada as well. ([The full 36 page Supreme Court ruling if you're interested in reading](https://www.scribd.com/document/463254844/2020-BCSC-785-United-States-v-Meng))\n\n**Expected Outcomes**\n\nMoving forward, I think the primary question we have to consider now, is what exactly is going to happen once Meng is extradited to the United States. Were it any other case, this would be a pretty clear cut white collar fraud cause. Of course, this isn't just any case, and the context of the trade tensions between the U.S. and China as well as ongoing geopolitical issues like with the Hong Kong protests, all have to be taken into account.",

It turned out that the people they were betting against knew nothing about the impending housing crash: \"business is good, profits are strong, and the mortgage continues to be the bedrock of the economy\". What Front Point Partners knew was still a secret.\n\nOn the other hand, the doomers in this sub kept repeating the same arguments over and over again: second wave, huge unemployment, etc. That **wasn't a big secret** to anyone. People with money to move markets knew that, and rightfully shrugged it off. I know it's become a meme here, but that's what priced in means.\n\nUnless you know something most people haven't figure out yet, you're not going to beat the market. In high frequency trading, this advantage is done by getting relatively simple information faster than everyone else - rule of thumb, if it's on the news already, it's been arbitraged away. In longer term investing, this is done through predictive models. The medium frequency traders find ways to predict probabilities of momentum and reversal to mean, and the low frequency traders, also known as investors, will model the future cashflows of the business based on macro, industry, and other types of information.\n\nFinally, when you think the market is irrational, just remember that means you're saying you're smarter than almost everyone else in the markets. The likelihood of that for the average Reddit user: 0%. So either, [be faster, smarter, but don't cheat](https://youtu.be/Hhy7JUinlu0?t=381).",

        "selftext": "I am posting my portfolio and strategies here to gain insight and hopefully learn from those that are much smarter than I am. Please be critical and constructive! \n\nI have decided to split my cash into two portfolios: core holdings and secondary portfolio which has a worth of 50% of my core holdings portfolio (150% total).\n\nThese are my targets for my core holdings portfolio:\n\n|Canadian Utilities (CU)|10.53%|\n|:-|:-|\n|Enbridge (ENB)|10.53%|\n|TD Bank (TD)|13.16%|\n|Canada West Bank (CWB)|13.16%|\n|Northwest Healthcare Properties REIT (NWH)|10.53%|\n|Riocan (REI)|21.05%|\n|Telus (T)|10.53%|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The reason I am drawn to these companies:\n   * I wanted to set up a dividend portfolio in my TFSA and reinvest dividends via DRIPs. These companies had high yields back in March when the pandemic hit and I saw an opportunity to lock in high yields with big, relatively safe Canadian companies that are an integral part of our economy. \n   * Other companies that I considered and may go back to:\n      * Financials: CIX, because it dropped harder than the banks and looking at the charts, I am expecting a breakout soon. I also considered all the other 5 big banks but went with TD due to their exposure to the US market. \n      * REITs: BPY, HR-UN. I am desperate to save enough money to open a DRIP with HR REIT. I believe they are undervalued according to their balance sheets and I did pick up a few shares at $8.20 and wish I had more cash to pour into it at that time. \n      * Communications: RCI, BCE, but decided on Telus due to their EMR market share. Also having first hand experience - their EMR is extremely user friendly and maintenance and administration is cheaper and easier than OSCAR based systems. This is especially true for rural communities with an aging population since all those patients still carry flip phones and most just rely on their landline. Using Facetime or smartphone based tech makes them uncomfortable. Seeing the system in action during this lockdown, especially how well it works with a work from home model has increased my liking for the company since everything is integrated into the EMR. The main problem with OSCAR systems is that not all hospitals are compatible with it and syncing medical records across two different systems is a pain. Telus has made their system compatible with a lot of rural hospitals and thus been able to connect the doctors offices with their local hospitals. \n      * I also considered Northwest Company, and in the future, when I have enough saved for a DRIP, I will be adding that to my TFSA also. The reasoning behind this is they have captured a niche market and are serving underserved areas and developing reliance on their product. The strength of this company is reflected in its' aggressive V-shaped recovery during the pandemic. \n      * I may also swap out ENB for AltaGas, but for now I am comfortable holding ENB at least for a year or so to see how it reacts to the market while I collect dividends. Though, eventually I'd like to transition out of oil and into renewable energy or possibly hold both at the same time depending on my cash at hand. \n* Currently I am DCA-ing my way into the positions of my core holdings. I have currently invested 50% of my total core holdings budget and have a remaining 50% currently sitting as cash, waiting to be deployed. I know everyone says you can't time the market and that's the reason I have decided to DCA - however, I feel like the current rally in markets is premature and a correction is on the horizon which is why I have paused my DCA contributions for now. I want to spread the money out for a longer period of time, possibly past September and into November and possibly even into December. \n* This is where I have my first question - am I just being overly speculative and cautious? Should I just blindly buy stocks systematically every two weeks or is my strategy to pause contributions viable? I found that I ended up DCA-ing upwards as the markets have rallied and missed out on opportunities which I wouldn't have missed out on if I had invested as a lump sum in March. \n* My secondary portfolio is a bit less organized. I have used this portfolio to buy and hold for a few days and then take profits. So basically swing trading, but I wish I had more cash so I could have held on to some of these for longer and bought them earlier. Here are a few trades that I made in the past:\n   * ATE.V: I've been holding this since early April. Currently sitting on about 500 shares. I believe in the product but boy, has management really been bad with communicating with their share holders. Its a long term play, and management has a decent strategy going forward and I will continue to hold unless the company shows signs of completely tanking. \n   * QSR: Bought and sold, made a few bucks in profit in early march. Never intended to hold this long term but I may reevaluate that in the future. Long term I would have to decide between this or A &amp; W income fund.\n   * ATZ: made a tidy profit off Aritizia too, looking to re enter possibly next quarter.\n   * ROOT: Same as ATZ. No intention of reentry. \n   * CGX: bought when it was around $12 and sold when it hit $14. No intention of reentry.\n   * MIR.V: made a 50% (FIFTY!) profit but only had about $50 to put in initially. Cashed out at $80. I want to re enter with about $1K on this.\n   * HR-UN: Yeah, I swing (swung?) traded a REIT. Bought at $8.20 and sold at $10.20 Would have liked to hold it longer but wanted to free up cash. Looking to re enter next quarter. \n   * BMO: So basically I had about $1K sitting in cash and BMO was lagging the other banks as the sector was recovering so I bought as much as I could. Now I feel trapped since I got a great deal at around $61 and am considering moving this to my core holdings, but I already have enough financial sector exposure in my core portfolio. I am up around 20% and feel like if I hold I can make more profit. I am also, at the same time, very tempted to liquidate and carry the funds forward into my future investments which I will highlight below. Any thoughts on strategy regarding this would be appreciated. \n* Future investments in my secondary portfolio:\n   * Currently I'm working on a strategy to invest with my secondary portfolio. Basically I just need to decide cut down this list to about 4-6 companies and decide on entry points:\n      * [WELL](https://WELL.TO)\n      * ATZ\n      * GOOS\n      * BB\n      * FLT\n      * LSPD\n      * CSH-UN\n      * HR-UN\n      * MIR.V\n      * I am also looking at the following but would need to research more and drop some other tickers to pick these up: SVI, PLC, TFII\n   * Basically, I am looking for value and growth in these companies and looking to enter with about $1k for each. Personally I am very drawn towards WELL, ATZ, GOOS, MIR, LSPD and CSH-UN\n* Another question I had was if I am swing trading, should I not do that in my TFSA? I can liquidate a few positions and put them into a taxable account just for swing trading. I would leave my secondary portfolio in my TFSA as a growth only portfolio and separate some funds solely for swing trading (basically play money). \n* Am I better off just converting my cash to USD and investing in TSLA, BRK.B, and Apple, AMD, etc?\n* The reason I am waiting for next quarter to re enter is because I fully believe there will be a market correction and a possible second downturn due to requirements for emergency subsidies being tightened up. The government can only sustain this for so long. Secondly, I don't think losses will be fully realized until next quarter. Thirdly, there is a possibility for a credit crisis and the big banks are fully expecting this which is why they increased their loss provisions according to the latest financial reports. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd now the age old question - \"Why not just buy a couple of ETfs and forget about it?\"\n\nI strongly considered XDV, XDIV, XEI as the majority investments in my core holdings along with a few exposure ETF's like TEC, VHT, some international exposure and small cap value ETFs.   \n\n\nWhy did I decide against it? I feel like ETFs offer less value when it comes to value investing. Sure, they dropped in price when the markets went down but I still feel like the rebound is dampened (as are the drops) which is to be expected because the risk is also lower. However, if I invest $1K into WELL for example, I will receive 100% of the value when it pops up, whereas if I purchase a small cap health/tech ETF which includes WELL,  the ETF would probably return much less value to me, not to mention that during re-balancing, the fund manager could classify WELL to be a large cap company and balance the company out of the ETF since it doesn't meet the requirements anymore and I would have to live with that decision, or go out and buy it but at that point I'd have missed out on most of the growth. \n\nSecondly, I found that most ETFs that hold Canadian banks have a lower dividend yield than if I had just held the banks directly. Granted, it wouldn't be at the same weight and I would probably only hold one or two banks instead of all 5 via an ETF but I don't really care for holding all 5 and especially so if the dividend yield is higher. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore I started investing, I paper traded for years just out of curiosity and I was always interested in stock prices. I did a lot of research and learning before starting to invest and felt like I knew what I was doing. Now I feel like I have no idea what I am doing (lol). My goal for the next year or so is to try and fully understand options trading in order to make weekly income, paper trade and develop a strategy and by next March start options trading. Currently learning about the wheel strategy and am really excited about trying it out. \n\nI also want to gain US market exposure, namely in the tech sector. I feel like a lot of growth is to be had there.\n\nPlease let me know what you think! I need to know where I stand with my investment strategy. Constructive criticism is most welcome!",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 8th, 2020.\n\n# **Look for the S&amp;P 500 to turn positive for the year with a boost from the Fed in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/05/look-for-the-sp-500-to-turn-positive-for-the-year-with-a-boost-from-the-fed-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to reassure markets next week the central bank will do whatever it takes to help the economy heal. That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting is the big event for markets in the coming week. There are a few economic reports, including inflation data, the consumer price index Wednesday and producer prices Thursday. Weekly jobless claims will be important Thursday to see if there\u2019s a drop in continuing clams, after May\u2019s employment report showed a surprising record gain of 2.5 million jobs.\n*****\n&gt; The reopening trade was in full swing in the past week, especially Friday when stocks surged on the jobs report, which was expected to show a loss of 8.3 million jobs. The Nasdaq broke above its record high set on Feb. 19, and the S&amp;P 500 was just 1.1% away from turning positive for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Even before the jobs report, investors were loading up on financials, industrials, transports and small caps, which were up more than 8% for the week and 18.4% in the past month. S&amp;P financials were 12.1% higher on the week, S&amp;P industrials were up 10.5, and the NYSE airline index jumped more than 35.4.%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think next week is dominated by the reopening and it will be for another month,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. \u201cWith cyclicals outperforming, small [caps] outperforming, credit spreads coming in and then the bond yields going up, everybody \u2014 all facets of the financial markets \u2014 are sort of suggesting the same outcome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 3,193, a gain of 4.9%, and now traders are watching to see if it can scale the psychological 3,200 level. The Dow closed Friday at 27,110, up 6.8% for the week, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.4%, at 9,814 after reaching an intraday record high of 9,845 Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts say the market will likely look past the protests that broke out in cities across the U.S. after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Four policemen were charged with murder in his death. Looters joined the protests, some of which turned violent, but they quieted down towards the end of the week.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher for a third week in a row, but a change this past week has been the abrupt lurch higher in Treasury yields. The 10-year rose to a high of 0.95% Friday, a quarter-point move in just three sessions. The move was already underway but got a lift Wednesday when ADP jobs data was not nearly as bad as expected. Yields ripped even higher after the May employment report showed the unemployment rate actually fell to 13.3%, instead of climbing to 20%, as expected by economists.\n*****\n&gt; Bond strategists said the Treasury market was now acknowledging the potential for a recovery, but not in the exuberant way the stock market has been. Since March 23, the S&amp;P 500 has risen more than 45%, but it took the 10-year Treasury until this week to get back the yield level it was at when stocks bottomed.\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen said he believes a new bull market has been launched, but there could be pullbacks and some headwinds for the market coming up.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhen GDP is minus 30%, other issues don\u2019t matter. There\u2019s just one issue. But as the economy reopens again, the trade battles will matter again, presidential politics will matter again,\u201d said Paulsen, adding the budget deficit could also matter. \u201cI think we\u2019ll get removed from a sole focus. That isn\u2019t quite there but I think it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed begins its two-day meeting Tuesday, and will release its statement Wednesday afternoon, followed by a video briefing by Powell.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhey would the Fed want to disrupt this with anything?\u201d Paulsen said. \u201cThey\u2019re still going to support the economy. They\u2019re going to stay away from negative rates or yield curve management. They\u2019re not going to do anything to scare the markets. They might certainly reassure people that they are still ready to provide support.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America, said the Fed may clarify where it stands on some of the extraordinary moves it has taken since it cut rates to zero. The Fed has been supporting the markets with asset purchases and multiple programs for commercial paper, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds, for example.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe think right now they\u2019re just trying to get this Main Street lending program to work. The question is are they going to do more things around what they do in terms of forward guidance and next steps of macro easing,\u201d Harris said.\n*****\n&gt; There has been speculation that the Fed would do some type of so-called yield curve control, a program to keep interest rates capped at certain levels. \u201cI think it\u2019s too early for that,\u201d said Harris. He said the Fed would be guaranteeing low rates for a long period of time if it does yield curve control.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYield curve control is basically open-ended quantitative easing,\u201d he said. The Fed is currently buying Treasurys but if it wanted to stop yields from rising too much as the economy improves, it could make targeted purchases.\n*****\n&gt; Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said it\u2019s possible the Fed could announce the yield curve control. \u201cWe\u2019ve said they could implement yield curve control out to three years,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my mind that matches the length of the horizon of the economic projections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Powell has said the economy needs more fiscal help, and he could reiterate those comments Wednesday. President Donald Trump on Friday said he backs more stimulus. So far, the Democrats have put out a marker with their wish list for further spending, but there have been no negotiations.\n*****\n&gt; There was concern the strong jobs report could make it harder to get buy in for another big spending package. But some economists say the recovery needs a boost and states need funding to fill the holes in their budgets from coronavirus-related spending and a lack of tax receipts.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7klaXQm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PKTBzT2.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/a5JkAB6.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/M2x4Qoq.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qtJYfXN.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bjiJWjV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UAi19KJ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GQm4ruO.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uV1U7FN.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/wm2XJND.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yarkiMO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hFblu2G.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Stocks Outpacing Analyst Price Targets\n\n&gt; This morning's jobs report shocked the financial world -- most notably the economists whose job it is to provide estimates. The consensus estimate among economists for May nonfarm payrolls was projecting a loss of more than 7 million jobs. The actual number that was reported did not just show a smaller than expected job loss, but it actually showed a gain in jobs of more than 2.5 million.\n\n&gt; We're seeing a similar situation play out in the equity analyst community. With the S&amp;P 500 now up 40%+ since its low less than three months ago, the average stock in the index is now trading above its consensus analyst price target that looks 12 months out. Analysts have simply not been able to catch up to the rapid rise we've seen for equity prices.\n\n&gt; It's extremely rare to see share prices move above consensus analyst price targets. We don't have the historical daily data on this, but anecdotally we can't remember a time when the spread has been this wide. As shown below, at the end of 2019 when the S&amp;P finished a massive rally, equity prices were 5.5% below the consensus price target. That was seen as a very tight spread prior to what we're seeing now. At the lows in March, the average share price had dropped all the way to $92.50 compared to an average consensus price target of $143.20. That projected a gain of 54.9% at the time!\n\n&gt; Since March 23rd, the average share price has risen from $92.50 up to $138.40, while the average analyst price target has fallen from $143.20 to $136. Current price targets no longer project a gain for the average S&amp;P 500 stock, but rather a 1.7% drop.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/avgpricetarget.png))**\n\n&gt; # Nasdaq's Historical Run\n\n&gt; At its highs earlier this morning, the Nasdaq Composite was within 2% of its record high from earlier in the year. Besides the steep V-shape of the Nasdaq's pattern over the last four months, the other aspect of the chart that stands out is just how steep the 50-day moving average is trending lately.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-50DMAa.png))**\n\n&gt; To illustrate just how steep the Nasdaq's 50-DMA has become, the chart below shows the daily percentage change of the 50-day going back to 1971. Currently, the Nasdaq 50-DMA is rising at an average of over 0.5% per day. That's an incredible slope and a level that has been exceeded only a handful of times in the Nasdaq's 50-year history.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-Composite1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Big Gains From Smaller Tech\n\n&gt; It's still difficult to fathom the moves in the US equity market over the last four months. The fact that the Nasdaq and more specifically the Technology sector aren't far from record highs is definitely something no one was expecting two months ago. There's an old market saying that equities take the stairs up and the elevator down, but in the latest market cycle, the elevator up was almost as fast as the way down!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Nasdaq.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Technology-Sector.png))**\n\n&gt; If you've been following the markets, all you've likely heard up until recently is that large-cap tech, and more specifically, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Facebook (FB), are single-handedly driving the market higher. The reality is not nearly as clear-cut. Given their market caps, the \"Big 5\" (as they're often referred to) have done a lot of heavy lifting, but in terms of performance, they're hardly the only game in town.\n\n&gt; The table below lists Technology sector stocks in the Russell 3000 with market caps of more than $1 billion that are outperforming all of the 'big 5' tech stocks on a YTD basis. Actually, since Amazon is doing so well relative to the rest of the \"big 5\" these are all stocks that are outperforming Amazon. If we looked for stocks that were doing better than the average return of the \"big 5\" the list would be a lot, lot longer (+16.4%).\n\n&gt; Looking through the list of names below, the two top-performing names are Zscaler (ZS) and Twilio (TWLO), which have both more than doubled. Behind these two, DocuSign (DOCU) and Sprout Social (SPT) are both knocking on the door of triple-digits. All 28 of the names listed have market caps of $1 billion, but the average market cap is just over $21 billion, while Nvidia (NVDA) is the largest company on the list with a market cap of $216 billion. For the most part, these aren't names that have been driving the indices, but anyone holding these stocks in their portfolio probably doesn't care!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Tech-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Best 50-Day Rally Ever\n\n&gt; In many ways, what we\u2019ve seen so far in 2020 has been both record-breaking and devastating. From the S&amp;P 500 Index peak on February 19 to the bear market lows March 23, stocks lost 33.9%. Now, 50 trading days later, stocks have gained 39.6%, for the largest 50-day rally since the S&amp;P 500 moved to 500 stocks in 1957.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere are no rollercoasters that can replicate what stocks have done so far in 2020,\u201d exclaimed LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHere\u2019s the catch though: Big 50-day rallies in the past have taken place near the start of new bull markets, and the returns going out a year were quite bullish.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 39.6% gain in 50 days was the greatest 50-day rally ever, besting the previous best in October 1982. What\u2019s important to note here is that many of these rallies took place coming off major market lows, and delivered quite strong returns going out 6 to 12 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/best-fifty-days.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Although we have near-term worries given this historic run, as some sentiment indicators such as put/call ratios are showing some froth, from a bigger picture perspective, this strong 50-day rally offers a reason to think stock prices may be even higher this time next year.\n\n*****\n\n# 2020 In Charts\n\n&gt; 2020 is only five months old, but in many ways it is one of the most historic years we\u2019ve ever seen. \u201c2020 went from moving along nicely, to seeing the worst recession in a generation and the fastest bear market ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cNow stocks are in the midst of one of the best bull runs ever, even though the economy remains extremely weak, thanks to record stimulus and hopes over a vaccine.\u201d\n&gt; \nTo best sum it all up, here are 10 charts that tell the picture of 2020 so far.\n\n&gt; 1.) The 2010s were the first decade in history to go all 10 years without a recession, which of course ended just months into the new decade, as the economy stopped. Stocks gained 13.5% on an annual basis last decade, surprisingly, only the third-best decade over the past four.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 2.) This is an election year, and the S&amp;P 500 Index hasn\u2019t been lower when a President is up for reelection since FDR in 1940. Although this seemed nearly impossible at the March lows, it is looking like this incredible streak could have a chance in 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 3.) One of the first signs something could go wrong in 2020 was stocks fell in January. Historically, this has meant potential trouble for the final 11 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 4.) As fears over COVID-19 gripped the world, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its fastest bear market ever, in only 19 days. To put this in perspective, this was the fastest bear market in the 124-year history of the Dow.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 5.) Mark Twain said \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes\u201d. Looking at history, every 50 years there has been a terrible pandemic and stocks fell more than 30%. We don\u2019t know if the ultimate lows are in this time, but so far, history is rhyming.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 6.) More than 20 million people in the US lost their jobs in April, while the unemployment rate soared to near 15%, the highest since the Great Depression. Record drops in manufacturing, industrial production, retail sales, and consumer spending have all taken place in the past two months as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 7.) A recession is here, ending the streak of 128 months in a row without one. What is unique about the previous expansion was nominal gross domestic product (GDP) grew only 50%, about the average growth seen during the previous expansions, but this expansion was nearly twice as long as the average expansion (10 years versus 5 years).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 8.) The bounce off of the March 23 S&amp;P 500 lows has been historic in many ways. In fact, it was one of the best 20-day rallies ever, with previous best rallies seeing strong returns 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 9.) As scary as it was on the way down, stocks have come roaring back, gaining more than 35% from the March 23 lows. This would classify as the greatest bear market bounce ever, which opens the question: is this more than a bear market bounce and instead the start of a new bull market?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 10.) The number of COVID-19 tests in the US nearly doubled in May versus what was seen in April. Additionally, fewer and fewer tests are coming back positive. Testing is one of the key ways we will beat this and this is a step in the right direction.

It hasn\u2019t been easy for any of us, and we continue to keep everyone impacted by this pandemic in mind, but we continue to see the glass as half full.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 8th, 2020.\n\n# **Look for the S&amp;P 500 to turn positive for the year with a boost from the Fed in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/05/look-for-the-sp-500-to-turn-positive-for-the-year-with-a-boost-from-the-fed-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to reassure markets next week the central bank will do whatever it takes to help the economy heal. That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting is the big event for markets in the coming week. There are a few economic reports, including inflation data, the consumer price index Wednesday and producer prices Thursday. Weekly jobless claims will be important Thursday to see if there\u2019s a drop in continuing clams, after May\u2019s employment report showed a surprising record gain of 2.5 million jobs.\n*****\n&gt; The reopening trade was in full swing in the past week, especially Friday when stocks surged on the jobs report, which was expected to show a loss of 8.3 million jobs. The Nasdaq broke above its record high set on Feb. 19, and the S&amp;P 500 was just 1.1% away from turning positive for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Even before the jobs report, investors were loading up on financials, industrials, transports and small caps, which were up more than 8% for the week and 18.4% in the past month. S&amp;P financials were 12.1% higher on the week, S&amp;P industrials were up 10.5, and the NYSE airline index jumped more than 35.4.%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think next week is dominated by the reopening and it will be for another month,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. \u201cWith cyclicals outperforming, small [caps] outperforming, credit spreads coming in and then the bond yields going up, everybody \u2014 all facets of the financial markets \u2014 are sort of suggesting the same outcome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 3,193, a gain of 4.9%, and now traders are watching to see if it can scale the psychological 3,200 level. The Dow closed Friday at 27,110, up 6.8% for the week, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.4%, at 9,814 after reaching an intraday record high of 9,845 Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts say the market will likely look past the protests that broke out in cities across the U.S. after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Four policemen were charged with murder in his death. Looters joined the protests, some of which turned violent, but they quieted down towards the end of the week.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher for a third week in a row, but a change this past week has been the abrupt lurch higher in Treasury yields. The 10-year rose to a high of 0.95% Friday, a quarter-point move in just three sessions. The move was already underway but got a lift Wednesday when ADP jobs data was not nearly as bad as expected. Yields ripped even higher after the May employment report showed the unemployment rate actually fell to 13.3%, instead of climbing to 20%, as expected by economists.\n*****\n&gt; Bond strategists said the Treasury market was now acknowledging the potential for a recovery, but not in the exuberant way the stock market has been. Since March 23, the S&amp;P 500 has risen more than 45%, but it took the 10-year Treasury until this week to get back the yield level it was at when stocks bottomed.\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen said he believes a new bull market has been launched, but there could be pullbacks and some headwinds for the market coming up.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhen GDP is minus 30%, other issues don\u2019t matter. There\u2019s just one issue. But as the economy reopens again, the trade battles will matter again, presidential politics will matter again,\u201d said Paulsen, adding the budget deficit could also matter. \u201cI think we\u2019ll get removed from a sole focus. That isn\u2019t quite there but I think it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed begins its two-day meeting Tuesday, and will release its statement Wednesday afternoon, followed by a video briefing by Powell.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhey would the Fed want to disrupt this with anything?\u201d Paulsen said. \u201cThey\u2019re still going to support the economy. They\u2019re going to stay away from negative rates or yield curve management. They\u2019re not going to do anything to scare the markets. They might certainly reassure people that they are still ready to provide support.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America, said the Fed may clarify where it stands on some of the extraordinary moves it has taken since it cut rates to zero. The Fed has been supporting the markets with asset purchases and multiple programs for commercial paper, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds, for example.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe think right now they\u2019re just trying to get this Main Street lending program to work. The question is are they going to do more things around what they do in terms of forward guidance and next steps of macro easing,\u201d Harris said.\n*****\n&gt; There has been speculation that the Fed would do some type of so-called yield curve control, a program to keep interest rates capped at certain levels. \u201cI think it\u2019s too early for that,\u201d said Harris. He said the Fed would be guaranteeing low rates for a long period of time if it does yield curve control.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYield curve control is basically open-ended quantitative easing,\u201d he said. The Fed is currently buying Treasurys but if it wanted to stop yields from rising too much as the economy improves, it could make targeted purchases.\n*****\n&gt; Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said it\u2019s possible the Fed could announce the yield curve control. \u201cWe\u2019ve said they could implement yield curve control out to three years,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my mind that matches the length of the horizon of the economic projections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Powell has said the economy needs more fiscal help, and he could reiterate those comments Wednesday. President Donald Trump on Friday said he backs more stimulus. So far, the Democrats have put out a marker with their wish list for further spending, but there have been no negotiations.\n*****\n&gt; There was concern the strong jobs report could make it harder to get buy in for another big spending package. But some economists say the recovery needs a boost and states need funding to fill the holes in their budgets from coronavirus-related spending and a lack of tax receipts.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7klaXQm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PKTBzT2.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/a5JkAB6.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/M2x4Qoq.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qtJYfXN.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bjiJWjV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UAi19KJ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GQm4ruO.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uV1U7FN.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/wm2XJND.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yarkiMO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hFblu2G.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Stocks Outpacing Analyst Price Targets\n\n&gt; This morning's jobs report shocked the financial world -- most notably the economists whose job it is to provide estimates. The consensus estimate among economists for May nonfarm payrolls was projecting a loss of more than 7 million jobs. The actual number that was reported did not just show a smaller than expected job loss, but it actually showed a gain in jobs of more than 2.5 million.\n\n&gt; We're seeing a similar situation play out in the equity analyst community. With the S&amp;P 500 now up 40%+ since its low less than three months ago, the average stock in the index is now trading above its consensus analyst price target that looks 12 months out. Analysts have simply not been able to catch up to the rapid rise we've seen for equity prices.\n\n&gt; It's extremely rare to see share prices move above consensus analyst price targets. We don't have the historical daily data on this, but anecdotally we can't remember a time when the spread has been this wide. As shown below, at the end of 2019 when the S&amp;P finished a massive rally, equity prices were 5.5% below the consensus price target. That was seen as a very tight spread prior to what we're seeing now. At the lows in March, the average share price had dropped all the way to $92.50 compared to an average consensus price target of $143.20. That projected a gain of 54.9% at the time!\n\n&gt; Since March 23rd, the average share price has risen from $92.50 up to $138.40, while the average analyst price target has fallen from $143.20 to $136. Current price targets no longer project a gain for the average S&amp;P 500 stock, but rather a 1.7% drop.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/avgpricetarget.png))**\n\n&gt; # Nasdaq's Historical Run\n\n&gt; At its highs earlier this morning, the Nasdaq Composite was within 2% of its record high from earlier in the year. Besides the steep V-shape of the Nasdaq's pattern over the last four months, the other aspect of the chart that stands out is just how steep the 50-day moving average is trending lately.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-50DMAa.png))**\n\n&gt; To illustrate just how steep the Nasdaq's 50-DMA has become, the chart below shows the daily percentage change of the 50-day going back to 1971. Currently, the Nasdaq 50-DMA is rising at an average of over 0.5% per day. That's an incredible slope and a level that has been exceeded only a handful of times in the Nasdaq's 50-year history.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-Composite1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Big Gains From Smaller Tech\n\n&gt; It's still difficult to fathom the moves in the US equity market over the last four months. The fact that the Nasdaq and more specifically the Technology sector aren't far from record highs is definitely something no one was expecting two months ago. There's an old market saying that equities take the stairs up and the elevator down, but in the latest market cycle, the elevator up was almost as fast as the way down!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Nasdaq.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Technology-Sector.png))**\n\n&gt; If you've been following the markets, all you've likely heard up until recently is that large-cap tech, and more specifically, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Facebook (FB), are single-handedly driving the market higher. The reality is not nearly as clear-cut. Given their market caps, the \"Big 5\" (as they're often referred to) have done a lot of heavy lifting, but in terms of performance, they're hardly the only game in town.\n\n&gt; The table below lists Technology sector stocks in the Russell 3000 with market caps of more than $1 billion that are outperforming all of the 'big 5' tech stocks on a YTD basis. Actually, since Amazon is doing so well relative to the rest of the \"big 5\" these are all stocks that are outperforming Amazon. If we looked for stocks that were doing better than the average return of the \"big 5\" the list would be a lot, lot longer (+16.4%).\n\n&gt; Looking through the list of names below, the two top-performing names are Zscaler (ZS) and Twilio (TWLO), which have both more than doubled. Behind these two, DocuSign (DOCU) and Sprout Social (SPT) are both knocking on the door of triple-digits. All 28 of the names listed have market caps of $1 billion, but the average market cap is just over $21 billion, while Nvidia (NVDA) is the largest company on the list with a market cap of $216 billion. For the most part, these aren't names that have been driving the indices, but anyone holding these stocks in their portfolio probably doesn't care!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Tech-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Best 50-Day Rally Ever\n\n&gt; In many ways, what we\u2019ve seen so far in 2020 has been both record-breaking and devastating. From the S&amp;P 500 Index peak on February 19 to the bear market lows March 23, stocks lost 33.9%. Now, 50 trading days later, stocks have gained 39.6%, for the largest 50-day rally since the S&amp;P 500 moved to 500 stocks in 1957.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere are no rollercoasters that can replicate what stocks have done so far in 2020,\u201d exclaimed LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHere\u2019s the catch though: Big 50-day rallies in the past have taken place near the start of new bull markets, and the returns going out a year were quite bullish.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 39.6% gain in 50 days was the greatest 50-day rally ever, besting the previous best in October 1982. What\u2019s important to note here is that many of these rallies took place coming off major market lows, and delivered quite strong returns going out 6 to 12 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/best-fifty-days.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Although we have near-term worries given this historic run, as some sentiment indicators such as put/call ratios are showing some froth, from a bigger picture perspective, this strong 50-day rally offers a reason to think stock prices may be even higher this time next year.\n\n*****\n\n# 2020 In Charts\n\n&gt; 2020 is only five months old, but in many ways it is one of the most historic years we\u2019ve ever seen. \u201c2020 went from moving along nicely, to seeing the worst recession in a generation and the fastest bear market ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cNow stocks are in the midst of one of the best bull runs ever, even though the economy remains extremely weak, thanks to record stimulus and hopes over a vaccine.\u201d\n&gt; \nTo best sum it all up, here are 10 charts that tell the picture of 2020 so far.\n\n&gt; 1.) The 2010s were the first decade in history to go all 10 years without a recession, which of course ended just months into the new decade, as the economy stopped. Stocks gained 13.5% on an annual basis last decade, surprisingly, only the third-best decade over the past four.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 2.) This is an election year, and the S&amp;P 500 Index hasn\u2019t been lower when a President is up for reelection since FDR in 1940. Although this seemed nearly impossible at the March lows, it is looking like this incredible streak could have a chance in 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 3.) One of the first signs something could go wrong in 2020 was stocks fell in January. Historically, this has meant potential trouble for the final 11 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 4.) As fears over COVID-19 gripped the world, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its fastest bear market ever, in only 19 days. To put this in perspective, this was the fastest bear market in the 124-year history of the Dow.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 5.) Mark Twain said \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes\u201d. Looking at history, every 50 years there has been a terrible pandemic and stocks fell more than 30%. We don\u2019t know if the ultimate lows are in this time, but so far, history is rhyming.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 6.) More than 20 million people in the US lost their jobs in April, while the unemployment rate soared to near 15%, the highest since the Great Depression. Record drops in manufacturing, industrial production, retail sales, and consumer spending have all taken place in the past two months as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 7.) A recession is here, ending the streak of 128 months in a row without one. What is unique about the previous expansion was nominal gross domestic product (GDP) grew only 50%, about the average growth seen during the previous expansions, but this expansion was nearly twice as long as the average expansion (10 years versus 5 years).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 8.) The bounce off of the March 23 S&amp;P 500 lows has been historic in many ways. In fact, it was one of the best 20-day rallies ever, with previous best rallies seeing strong returns 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 9.) As scary as it was on the way down, stocks have come roaring back, gaining more than 35% from the March 23 lows. This would classify as the greatest bear market bounce ever, which opens the question: is this more than a bear market bounce and instead the start of a new bull market?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 10.) The number of COVID-19 tests in the US nearly doubled in May versus what was seen in April. Additionally, fewer and fewer tests are coming back positive. Testing is one of the key ways we will beat this and this is a step in the right direction. We\u2019ve also seen new monthly lows in people on ventilators, in the ICU, and in hospitals.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Hard to believe, but there are still 7 months left in 2020. It hasn\u2019t been easy for any of us, and we continue to keep everyone impacted by this pandemic in mind, but we continue to see the glass as half full. The dual benefit of record monetary and fiscal policy should help create a bridge to help those most impacted, while the economy can slowly come back online later this year.\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$ADBE** \n&gt; * **$UNFI** \n&gt; * **$CHWY** \n&gt; * **$TIF** \n&gt; * **$LULU** \n&gt; * **$COUP** \n&gt; * **$SFIX** \n&gt; * **$LOVE** \n&gt; * **$NEPT** \n&gt; * **$GHM** \n&gt; * **$REVG** \n&gt; * **$GME** \n&gt; * **$HDS** \n&gt; * **$FIVE** \n&gt; * **$SIG** \n&gt; * **$CASY** \n&gt; * **$CVGW** \n&gt; * **$AMC** \n&gt; * **$FCEL** \n&gt; * **$QTNT** \n&gt; * **$PLCE** \n&gt; * **$CHS** \n&gt; * **$THO** \n&gt; * **$GCO** \n&gt; * **$BF.B** \n&gt; * **$LMNR** \n&gt; * **$WSG** \n&gt; * **$PRTY** \n&gt; * **$GES** \n&gt; * **$BBCP** \n&gt; * **$CONN** \n&gt; * **$HEXO** \n&gt; * **$PHR** \n&gt; * **$PVH** \n&gt; * **$RRGB** \n&gt; * **$PLAY** \n&gt; * **$TNP** \n&gt; * **$JW.A** \n&gt; * **$SB** \n&gt; * **$GSM** \n&gt; * **$SRT**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/bgPdMCr.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.8.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/d2EW1kr.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uxSiJJr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.9.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3SIjcG7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cRBrPlt.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.10.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DaheXAm.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9mcHxTl.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.11.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/i8SNjWM.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9xcBZPK.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.12.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Inc. $392.90\n&gt; **Adobe Inc.

        "selftext": "The Oracle of Omaha has a reputation as the gentle GOAT, but is there more to this than meets the eye?\n\nIs there something that is often overlooked?\n\nOr is this reputation warranted? (get it...warren, warranted?)\n\nAnyway...Let's begin...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe story begins in 1942, when Warren Buffet bought his first shares at the age of just 11. \n\nThis is same year that his father Howard Buffett ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in the Nebraska district.\n\nHe won, and became a member of Congress in 1943.\n\nBefore this, Howard worked at a small stock brokerage firm.\n\nHe was reelected twice. However, in 1952, he decided against seeking another term and returned to his investment business in Omaha,\u00a0Buffett-Falk &amp; Co., where he worked until shortly before his death in 1964.\n\nBut what about Warren Buffett?\n\nIn 1951, after graduating from Columbia, where he was taught by Benjamin Graham, Buffett worked for three years at his father's firm as an investment salesman. \n\nIn 1954, Buffett accepted a job at Benjamin Graham's partnership, working as a securities analyst.\n\nHis starting salary was $12,000 a year - the equivalent of $114,000 today.\n\nHowever, just two years later, Graham retired and Buffett started his own investment partnership.\n\nHe went to his father's acquaintances to raise Capital for his first fund. \n\nThese were prominent families in Nebraska with big businesses and political connections.\n\nFor example, across the street was the family whose son became the CEO of Coca Cola - that family gave him $10,000.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn 2012, the STOCK Act or The Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act was signed into law.\u00a0 \n\nThe law prohibits the use of non-public information for private profit, including insider trading by members of Congress and other government employees.\n\nRemember, Buffett's father used to be in Congress.\n\n***The only people who were, before 2012, allowed to trade on insider information without having criminal charges brought against them were congressmen.***\n\nRemember, Buffett's father was a stock market broker prior to being elected and going to Congress, hence he had a comprehensive knowledge of the stock market and clearly had an interest in it. \n\nAfter all, it was his father who taught Buffett the ropes early on and had him buy his first shares as an eleven year old.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImagine you are Warren Buffett, and you can:\n\n1). Get insider information to trade on it;\n\n2). Get a six-figure position after College;\n\n3). After a few years, set up your own fund, getting money from wealthy family friends;\n\n4). Pay no dividends to investors and only put a hundred bucks of your own money into the fund;\n\n5). Let the mathematics of compounding work its magic as you bring in more institutional money;\n\n6). Become so connected Politically and connected on Wall Street that you can get special deals, which have practically no risk as you know bailouts are coming. For example, in the 2008 crisis, Berkshire owned stock valued at more than $13 billion in the top recipients of the TARP funds, and Berkshire had at least twice as much dependence on bailed-out banks as any other large investor;\n\n7). Have billions of dollars on hand, remember you aren't paying any dividends to investors, ready for the inevitable economic recession to hit so that you can sweep up cheap assets;\n\n8). Be holier-than-thou (i.e. calling derivatives \"financial weapons of mass destruction\" when, during the height of the 2008 crisis, Berkshire sold more than $2.5 billion worth of credit default swaps. OR what about Buffett's reputation as the saviour in the Great Recession when Berkshire is the majority owner of Moody's, who played a key role in inflating the crisis in 2008 - via their questionable debt and derivative ratings which inflated the mortgage and subprime market).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat about Buffett's status as the GOAT?\n\n[Jim Simons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcy8QaILDJI) has a far superior track record.\n\nBillionaire Chamath Palihapitiya has even stated that [Jeff Bezos is the best investor of our generation](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/12/chamath-palihapitiya-amazons-jeff-bezos-the-best-investor-better-than-warren-buffett.html#:~:text=Chamath%20Palihapitiya%20calls%20Amazon's%20Jeff%20Bezos,investor%2C%20better%20than%20Warren%20Buffett&amp;text=%E2%80%9CPeople%20used%20to%20lambaste%20Jeff,said%20on%20%E2%80%9CSquawk%20Box.%E2%80%9D), not Warren Buffett.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBuffett has missed out on an entire raft of tech and Berkshire has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 in recent years.\n\nBerkshire's best years are found overwhelmingly in the period before the tech era.\n\nAlso, he has been critical of Bitcoin, describing it as \"rat poison squared\"\n\nUltimately, Buffett is worth $73 billion, he doesn't need to have an in-depth understanding of new age tech.\n\nMoreover, Buffett has a huge stake in Finance 1.0, why would he give props to Finance 2.0?\n\nBitcoin as a savings vehicle is misaligned with Berkshire's don't-save-money-invest-it-in-us or consume more of the products of the businesses that Berkshire has a huge stake in, and is also misaligned with Berkshire's Cantillon insider advantages.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's worth noting that Howard Buffett strongly supported the gold standard because he believed it would limit the ability of government to inflate the money supply and spend beyond its means. Here is a direct quote from Howard:\n\n***\"I warn you that politicians of both parties will oppose the restoration of gold, although they may outwardly seemingly favor it,\u00a0unless you are willing to surrender your children and your country to galloping inflation, war and slavery\u00a0then this cause demands your support. For if human liberty is to survive in America, we must win the battle to restore honest money. There is no more important challenge facing us than this issue -- the restoration of your freedom to secure gold in exchange for the fruits of your labors.\"***\n\nHis son Warren, however, hates gold. See the [Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs) as to why.\n\n**Some have even argued that Buffett's success can be summarised by the following:**\n\n**First Deals = Insider Information**\n\n**Last Deals = Cantillon Effect**\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nIs it true... or false?\n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UpTUBgUYgc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UpTUBgUYgc)",

There are a few economic reports, including inflation data, the consumer price index Wednesday and producer prices Thursday. Weekly jobless claims will be important Thursday to see if there\u2019s a drop in continuing clams, after May\u2019s employment report showed a surprising record gain of 2.5 million jobs.\n*****\n&gt; The reopening trade was in full swing in the past week, especially Friday when stocks surged on the jobs report, which was expected to show a loss of 8.3 million jobs. The Nasdaq broke above its record high set on Feb. 19, and the S&amp;P 500 was just 1.1% away from turning positive for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Even before the jobs report, investors were loading up on financials, industrials, transports and small caps, which were up more than 8% for the week and 18.4% in the past month. S&amp;P financials were 12.1% higher on the week, S&amp;P industrials were up 10.5, and the NYSE airline index jumped more than 35.4.%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think next week is dominated by the reopening and it will be for another month,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. \u201cWith cyclicals outperforming, small [caps] outperforming, credit spreads coming in and then the bond yields going up, everybody \u2014 all facets of the financial markets \u2014 are sort of suggesting the same outcome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 3,193, a gain of 4.9%, and now traders are watching to see if it can scale the psychological 3,200 level. The Dow closed Friday at 27,110, up 6.8% for the week, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.4%, at 9,814 after reaching an intraday record high of 9,845 Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts say the market will likely look past the protests that broke out in cities across the U.S. after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Four policemen were charged with murder in his death. Looters joined the protests, some of which turned violent, but they quieted down towards the end of the week.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher for a third week in a row, but a change this past week has been the abrupt lurch higher in Treasury yields. The 10-year rose to a high of 0.95% Friday, a quarter-point move in just three sessions. The move was already underway but got a lift Wednesday when ADP jobs data was not nearly as bad as expected. Yields ripped even higher after the May employment report showed the unemployment rate actually fell to 13.3%, instead of climbing to 20%, as expected by economists.\n*****\n&gt; Bond strategists said the Treasury market was now acknowledging the potential for a recovery, but not in the exuberant way the stock market has been. Since March 23, the S&amp;P 500 has risen more than 45%, but it took the 10-year Treasury until this week to get back the yield level it was at when stocks bottomed.\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen said he believes a new bull market has been launched, but there could be pullbacks and some headwinds for the market coming up.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhen GDP is minus 30%, other issues don\u2019t matter. There\u2019s just one issue. But as the economy reopens again, the trade battles will matter again, presidential politics will matter again,\u201d said Paulsen, adding the budget deficit could also matter. \u201cI think we\u2019ll get removed from a sole focus. That isn\u2019t quite there but I think it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed begins its two-day meeting Tuesday, and will release its statement Wednesday afternoon, followed by a video briefing by Powell.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhey would the Fed want to disrupt this with anything?\u201d Paulsen said. \u201cThey\u2019re still going to support the economy. They\u2019re going to stay away from negative rates or yield curve management. They\u2019re not going to do anything to scare the markets. They might certainly reassure people that they are still ready to provide support.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America, said the Fed may clarify where it stands on some of the extraordinary moves it has taken since it cut rates to zero. The Fed has been supporting the markets with asset purchases and multiple programs for commercial paper, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds, for example.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe think right now they\u2019re just trying to get this Main Street lending program to work. The question is are they going to do more things around what they do in terms of forward guidance and next steps of macro easing,\u201d Harris said.\n*****\n&gt; There has been speculation that the Fed would do some type of so-called yield curve control, a program to keep interest rates capped at certain levels. \u201cI think it\u2019s too early for that,\u201d said Harris. He said the Fed would be guaranteeing low rates for a long period of time if it does yield curve control.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYield curve control is basically open-ended quantitative easing,\u201d he said. The Fed is currently buying Treasurys but if it wanted to stop yields from rising too much as the economy improves, it could make targeted purchases.\n*****\n&gt; Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said it\u2019s possible the Fed could announce the yield curve control. \u201cWe\u2019ve said they could implement yield curve control out to three years,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my mind that matches the length of the horizon of the economic projections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Powell has said the economy needs more fiscal help, and he could reiterate those comments Wednesday. President Donald Trump on Friday said he backs more stimulus. So far, the Democrats have put out a marker with their wish list for further spending, but there have been no negotiations.\n*****\n&gt; There was concern the strong jobs report could make it harder to get buy in for another big spending package. But some economists say the recovery needs a boost and states need funding to fill the holes in their budgets from coronavirus-related spending and a lack of tax receipts.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7klaXQm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PKTBzT2.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/a5JkAB6.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/M2x4Qoq.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qtJYfXN.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bjiJWjV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UAi19KJ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GQm4ruO.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uV1U7FN.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/wm2XJND.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yarkiMO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hFblu2G.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Stocks Outpacing Analyst Price Targets\n\n&gt; This morning's jobs report shocked the financial world -- most notably the economists whose job it is to provide estimates. The consensus estimate among economists for May nonfarm payrolls was projecting a loss of more than 7 million jobs. The actual number that was reported did not just show a smaller than expected job loss, but it actually showed a gain in jobs of more than 2.5 million.\n\n&gt; We're seeing a similar situation play out in the equity analyst community. With the S&amp;P 500 now up 40%+ since its low less than three months ago, the average stock in the index is now trading above its consensus analyst price target that looks 12 months out. Analysts have simply not been able to catch up to the rapid rise we've seen for equity prices.\n\n&gt; It's extremely rare to see share prices move above consensus analyst price targets. We don't have the historical daily data on this, but anecdotally we can't remember a time when the spread has been this wide. As shown below, at the end of 2019 when the S&amp;P finished a massive rally, equity prices were 5.5% below the consensus price target. That was seen as a very tight spread prior to what we're seeing now. At the lows in March, the average share price had dropped all the way to $92.50 compared to an average consensus price target of $143.20. That projected a gain of 54.9% at the time!\n\n&gt; Since March 23rd, the average share price has risen from $92.50 up to $138.40, while the average analyst price target has fallen from $143.20 to $136. Current price targets no longer project a gain for the average S&amp;P 500 stock, but rather a 1.7% drop.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/avgpricetarget.png))**\n\n&gt; # Nasdaq's Historical Run\n\n&gt; At its highs earlier this morning, the Nasdaq Composite was within 2% of its record high from earlier in the year. Besides the steep V-shape of the Nasdaq's pattern over the last four months, the other aspect of the chart that stands out is just how steep the 50-day moving average is trending lately.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-50DMAa.png))**\n\n&gt; To illustrate just how steep the Nasdaq's 50-DMA has become, the chart below shows the daily percentage change of the 50-day going back to 1971. Currently, the Nasdaq 50-DMA is rising at an average of over 0.5% per day. That's an incredible slope and a level that has been exceeded only a handful of times in the Nasdaq's 50-year history.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-Composite1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Big Gains From Smaller Tech\n\n&gt; It's still difficult to fathom the moves in the US equity market over the last four months. The fact that the Nasdaq and more specifically the Technology sector aren't far from record highs is definitely something no one was expecting two months ago. There's an old market saying that equities take the stairs up and the elevator down, but in the latest market cycle, the elevator up was almost as fast as the way down!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Nasdaq.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Technology-Sector.png))**\n\n&gt; If you've been following the markets, all you've likely heard up until recently is that large-cap tech, and more specifically, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Facebook (FB), are single-handedly driving the market higher. The reality is not nearly as clear-cut. Given their market caps, the \"Big 5\" (as they're often referred to) have done a lot of heavy lifting, but in terms of performance, they're hardly the only game in town.\n\n&gt; The table below lists Technology sector stocks in the Russell 3000 with market caps of more than $1 billion that are outperforming all of the 'big 5' tech stocks on a YTD basis. Actually, since Amazon is doing so well relative to the rest of the \"big 5\" these are all stocks that are outperforming Amazon. If we looked for stocks that were doing better than the average return of the \"big 5\" the list would be a lot, lot longer (+16.4%).\n\n&gt; Looking through the list of names below, the two top-performing names are Zscaler (ZS) and Twilio (TWLO), which have both more than doubled. Behind these two, DocuSign (DOCU) and Sprout Social (SPT) are both knocking on the door of triple-digits. All 28 of the names listed have market caps of $1 billion, but the average market cap is just over $21 billion, while Nvidia (NVDA) is the largest company on the list with a market cap of $216 billion. For the most part, these aren't names that have been driving the indices, but anyone holding these stocks in their portfolio probably doesn't care!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Tech-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Best 50-Day Rally Ever\n\n&gt; In many ways, what we\u2019ve seen so far in 2020 has been both record-breaking and devastating. From the S&amp;P 500 Index peak on February 19 to the bear market lows March 23, stocks lost 33.9%. Now, 50 trading days later, stocks have gained 39.6%, for the largest 50-day rally since the S&amp;P 500 moved to 500 stocks in 1957.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere are no rollercoasters that can replicate what stocks have done so far in 2020,\u201d exclaimed LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHere\u2019s the catch though: Big 50-day rallies in the past have taken place near the start of new bull markets, and the returns going out a year were quite bullish.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 39.6% gain in 50 days was the greatest 50-day rally ever, besting the previous best in October 1982. What\u2019s important to note here is that many of these rallies took place coming off major market lows, and delivered quite strong returns going out 6 to 12 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/best-fifty-days.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Although we have near-term worries given this historic run, as some sentiment indicators such as put/call ratios are showing some froth, from a bigger picture perspective, this strong 50-day rally offers a reason to think stock prices may be even higher this time next year.\n\n*****\n\n# 2020 In Charts\n\n&gt; 2020 is only five months old, but in many ways it is one of the most historic years we\u2019ve ever seen. \u201c2020 went from moving along nicely, to seeing the worst recession in a generation and the fastest bear market ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cNow stocks are in the midst of one of the best bull runs ever, even though the economy remains extremely weak, thanks to record stimulus and hopes over a vaccine.\u201d\n&gt; \nTo best sum it all up, here are 10 charts that tell the picture of 2020 so far.\n\n&gt; 1.) The 2010s were the first decade in history to go all 10 years without a recession, which of course ended just months into the new decade, as the economy stopped. Stocks gained 13.5% on an annual basis last decade, surprisingly, only the third-best decade over the past four.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 2.) This is an election year, and the S&amp;P 500 Index hasn\u2019t been lower when a President is up for reelection since FDR in 1940. Although this seemed nearly impossible at the March lows, it is looking like this incredible streak could have a chance in 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 3.) One of the first signs something could go wrong in 2020 was stocks fell in January. Historically, this has meant potential trouble for the final 11 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 4.) As fears over COVID-19 gripped the world, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its fastest bear market ever, in only 19 days. To put this in perspective, this was the fastest bear market in the 124-year history of the Dow.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 5.) Mark Twain said \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes\u201d. Looking at history, every 50 years there has been a terrible pandemic and stocks fell more than 30%. We don\u2019t know if the ultimate lows are in this time, but so far, history is rhyming.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 6.) More than 20 million people in the US lost their jobs in April, while the unemployment rate soared to near 15%, the highest since the Great Depression. Record drops in manufacturing, industrial production, retail sales, and consumer spending have all taken place in the past two months as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 7.) A recession is here, ending the streak of 128 months in a row without one. What is unique about the previous expansion was nominal gross domestic product (GDP) grew only 50%, about the average growth seen during the previous expansions, but this expansion was nearly twice as long as the average expansion (10 years versus 5 years).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 8.) The bounce off of the March 23 S&amp;P 500 lows has been historic in many ways. In fact, it was one of the best 20-day rallies ever, with previous best rallies seeing strong returns 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 9.) As scary as it was on the way down, stocks have come roaring back, gaining more than 35% from the March 23 lows. This would classify as the greatest bear market bounce ever, which opens the question: is this more than a bear market bounce and instead the start of a new bull market?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 10.) The number of COVID-19 tests in the US nearly doubled in May versus what was seen in April. Additionally, fewer and fewer tests are coming back positive. Testing is one of the key ways we will beat this and this is a step in the right direction. We\u2019ve also seen new monthly lows in people on ventilators, in the ICU, and in hospitals.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Hard to believe, but there are still 7 months left in 2020. It hasn\u2019t been easy for any of us, and we continue to keep everyone impacted by this pandemic in mind, but we continue to see the glass as half full. The dual benefit of record monetary and fiscal policy should help create a bridge to help those most impacted, while the economy can slowly come back online later this year.\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$ADBE** \n&gt; * **$UNFI** \n&gt; * **$CHWY** \n&gt; * **$TIF** \n&gt; * **$LULU** \n&gt; * **$COUP** \n&gt; * **$SFIX** \n&gt; * **$LOVE** \n&gt; * **$NEPT** \n&gt; * **$GHM** \n&gt; * **$REVG** \n&gt; * **$GME** \n&gt; * **$HDS** \n&gt; * **$FIVE** \n&gt; * **$SIG** \n&gt; * **$CASY** \n&gt; * **$CVGW** \n&gt; * **$AMC** \n&gt; * **$FCEL** \n&gt; * **$QTNT** \n&gt; * **$PLCE** \n&gt; * **$CHS** \n&gt; * **$THO** \n&gt; * **$GCO** \n&gt; * **$BF.B** \n&gt; * **$LMNR** \n&gt; * **$WSG** \n&gt; * **$PRTY** \n&gt; * **$GES** \n&gt; * **$BBCP** \n&gt; * **$CONN** \n&gt; * **$HEXO** \n&gt; * **$PHR** \n&gt; * **$PVH** \n&gt; * **$RRGB** \n&gt; * **$PLAY** \n&gt; * **$TNP** \n&gt; * **$JW.A** \n&gt; * **$SB** \n&gt; * **$GSM** \n&gt; * **$SRT**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/bgPdMCr.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.8.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/d2EW1kr.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uxSiJJr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.9.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3SIjcG7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cRBrPlt.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.10.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DaheXAm.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9mcHxTl.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.11.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/i8SNjWM.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9xcBZPK.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.12.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Inc. $392.90\n&gt; **Adobe Inc.

        "selftext": "Dear Investors, \nFirst of all, I\u2019m new in this community and your advices already helped me to make a few good picks. So, I would like to share my first due diligence with you. \nI\u2019ve been holding and watching this stock for almost 2 years. Cypress Development (TSX-V: CYP) (OTCQB: CYDVF) is a Canadian mining company, that has one major project I\u2019m focusing on.\nThey have the mining rights for Clayton Valley Project totalling 5,430 acres. Their prefeasibility study showed a highly profitable Lithium reservoir in their claim (source: https://www.cypressdevelopmentcorp.com/news/2020/cypress-development-files-prefeasibility-study-for-clayton-valley-lithium-project-in-nevada/)\nKey facts of the prefeasibility study: \n\nAverage production rate of 15,000 tonnes per day to produce 27,400 tonnes lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) annually over a +40-year mine life.\n\nCapital cost estimate of US$493 million, pre-production, and operating cost estimate averaging US$3,329* per tonne LCE.\n\nAfter-tax net present value at an 8% discount rate (NPV-8%) of US$1.052 billion and an after-tax internal rate of return (IRR) of 25.8% based on a price of $9,500/tonne for lithium carbonate.\n\nProduction based on Probable Mineral Reserve of 222 million tonnes averaging 1,141 ppm Li (1.353 Mt LCE).\n\nMineral Reserves and production plan derived from Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources of 593 million tonnes averaging 1,073 ppm Li (3.387 Mt LCE).\n\nIndustry-low cash cost of US$3,329 per tonne LCE\n\nSo to sum up, they are sitting on a huge depot of lithium in Nevada, USA which has one of the mining-friendliest jurisdiction in the USA (source: https://investingnews.com/innspired/nevada-largest-gold-producer/). They already made a prefeasibility study, which examined the profitability of the claim. Their CEO is Dr. Bill Willoughby, a veteran of mining management, with 38 years of experience in the branch. Another person, who is visible for the public is their Corporate Communication manager Don Myers. He is often guest in mining related podcasts and also does (poor) social media management. \nIMPORTANT: What you don\u2019t read on their website, but what they said in a few podcasts is, that they probably won\u2019t do the lithium mining themselves. They will probably sell the mining rights to another, bigger mining company (can\u2019t provide source on that, you have to look after mining podcasts). \nTheir stock is currently at 0,20 CAD. \nNow for the opportunities/risks: \nOpportunity: \n\nLithium is used for the production of battery cells, especially in the electric car industry \n\nElectromobilty is a current megatrend and highly subsidized by the EU \n\nTesla has a battery production Gigafactory in Nevada (source https://www.tesla.com/gigafactory?redirect=no)\n\nThe price could go high, when they sell the mining rights\n\nAs we all know, Trump is a president, whos aim it is to make the USA more self-sufficient, maybe he will provide laws to make mining of essential material in the USA more profitable\n\n\u00a0\nRisks: \n\nThe stock had not had any bigger rises in the last years, despite good news\n\nSo\u2026 if you were reading this far, you now ask yourself the question: If the inner value is really that high, why is this still a pennystock? \nI can\u2019t answer that with full security. As we all know, the stock market is a psychological market (I\u2019m a psychologist myself, btw). That means the intrinsic value is not essential for the share price. In my opinion their corporate communication is just too bad and it\u2019s not really known. \nSo I\u2019m looking forward to your feedback. You can criticize me, but please be fair, it\u2019s my first DD to post in this forum and I\u2019m pretty new to investing.",

Imperial Oil (an integrated petroleum company majority-owned by Exxon-Mobil).\n\n* Why you should invest:\n\n1. Expectation of recovery in industrials which will lead to increased consumption of petroleum products.\n2.

P/E at 10.16, [integrated oil industry P/E average at 14.0](https://csimarket.com/Industry/Industry_Valuation.php?ind=603). Massively undervalued compared to the industry.\n4. While they suffered a loss of 188million in Q1 2020 due to the OPEC spat, they have sizable cash reserve of over 1.7billion dollars and a quick ratio of 1.05. They are equipped to survive for the long haul.\n5. If you're into dividends, they're still paying dividends all the way up to March at 0.76/share.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Risks:\n\n1. V-shape recovery turns into a L-shape recovery and it turns into a long winter.\n2. Continued tension between Saudi+ Russia and the US O&amp;G pushes oil back below breakeven price again [(approx- $36/bbl)](https://www.reuters.com/article/canada-energy-oilprice-idUSL2N0XE1D620150417)\n\nSource: [Financial Reports of Imperial Oil Corp](https://www.imperialoil.ca/-/media/Imperial/Files/Annual-and-quarterly-reports/2020_q1_interim_report.pdf)",

        "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI work in fine jewelry and time piece sales.\nAs a promotion, from time to time a brand that we carry will reward us with discounts or prizes or often times gift cards.\n\nIt\u2019s more of a fun side benefit they give us but I worked my butt off last year and managed to pull in $1500 in prepaid Visa gift cards.\n\nThese gift cards aren\u2019t meant to be used at any one particular store, they can be used anywhere that visa is excepted as if it were cash.\nUnfortunately I am unable to go to an ATM or bank and make a withdrawal in actual cash.\n\nAny advice on how to actually turn it into cash? Or possibly use this to somehow make me money in an investment?\n(My expenses are extremely low and I don\u2019t want to just use it as my grocery money for the next couple months, I\u2019d rather use my credit card for points and then pay it off immediately)\n\nI called one of those payday loan type places and they buy the cards but only at 50%. So that was a no-go.\nI even tried calling a buddy and asking if he would want one or a few of them in exchange at a 95% rate (he pays $95 for every hundred etc. etc.)\n\nOf course he thought I was scamming him somehow ha ha\n\nI would appreciate any thoughts or ideas before I just give up and end up using it as grocery money",

I got great tips, opened a td account, and put several thousand into some staple stocks. Microsoft, home depot, Visa, Mastercard, etc. Since then, I've seen my earnings climb quite a bit. Now that feels good and all, but honestly it begs more questions. Do I just hold for better gains? Do I buy more? Do I sell everything, quit my job, and enjoy life as a thousandaire? Not looking for granular advice, just general direction. Also curious if anyone is in a similar position.",

It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.

        "selftext": " \n\n&gt;**Investment managers say asset prices are too detached from harsh economic realities** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Hedge funds are getting ready for another slide in stock markets after growing uneasy that surging prices do not reflect the economic problems ahead.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Some managers fear that equity investors \u2014 used to buying the dips during the decade-long bull market that ended in March\u2019s sharp sell-off \u2014 have become too complacent about how quickly economies can recover from the pandemic and how effective stimulus packages from central banks and governments can be.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The S&amp;P 500 index completed its best 50-day run in history on Wednesday, said LPL Financial, closing within 8 per cent of its record high of mid-February.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cThe markets are priced to perfection,\u201d said Danny Yong, founding partner at hedge fund Dymon Asia Capital in Singapore. \u201cThe stability in equity markets does not reflect the job losses and the insolvencies ahead of us globally.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Mr Yong has been buying put options \u2014 which protect against market falls by allowing their owner to sell at a predetermined price \u2014 on stock indices and also on currencies sensitive to risk appetite such as the Australian dollar and the Korean won.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cI believe we will see new lows in global equity markets later this year,\u201d he added. \u201cAs March . . . has shown us, prices cannot diverge from fundamentals for too long.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Other hedge fund managers have expressed concerns about the sharp rebound in stocks from the March lows.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Stanley Druckenmiller, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of George Soros who stepped back from managing outside money a decade ago, recently said he expected a wave of bankruptcies and that a V-shaped economic recovery was a \u201cfantasy\u201d.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Paul Singer\u2019s Elliott Management, which has $40bn in assets, wrote in its most recent letter to investors that, since the impact of the economic downturn was greater than that of the 2008 financial crisis, \u201cour gut tells us that a 50 per cent or deeper decline from the February top might be the ultimate path of global stock markets\u201d.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The fund made money during the first-quarter crash from hedges in stocks and credit, and said it was trying to find new ways of protecting itself against another market fall after some hedges became more expensive.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Despite bleak economic data \u2014 including more than 40m Americans filing for unemployment benefits and an expected record contraction in the eurozone economy in the second quarter \u2014 the S&amp;P 500 has surged almost 40 per cent since its trough in March, leaving it down just 3 per cent for the year.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The index is now trading at more than 22 times expected earnings for the next 12 months, according to FactSet figures, taking the common valuation measure back to levels not seen since the early 2000s.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Mr Yong believes investors could soon discover that the so-called \u201cFed put\u201d \u2014 the concept that the central bank will step in to support markets \u2014 may be reaching its limits.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cSome people believe the Fed\u2019s unconventional measures are limitless but this is not the case,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's now about the \u201cTrump Put\u201d \u2014 how much more stimulus can he push through? I think he \\[President Donald Trump\\] will be constrained by Democrats in the House.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that its hedge-fund clients held a net short position of about $40bn in Euro Stoxx 50 futures.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Global macro hedge funds have sharply reduced their exposures to stocks this year, according to JPMorgan Cazenove.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cIt is entirely possible that there will be a fourth-quarter reckoning, where a second wave of job losses and a prolonged period of business failures tests equity sentiment,\u201d said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Francesco Filia, head of London-based hedge fund Fasanara Capital, is holding 70 per cent of his fund in cash and also using put options and other instruments to hedge his portfolio while he waits for a \u201csevere rupture\u201d in markets.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He sees threats in the trend towards \u201cdeglobalisation,\u201d which could drive inflation higher, and growing political interference in the technology sector, which could hurt shareholder returns.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He expects a potential \u201c2008-style . . . daily liquidity crisis\u201d as investors try to pull money from exchange traded funds that may not be able to meet those redemptions.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;However, many fund managers are reluctant to bet outright against stocks in the face of stimulus efforts from the US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, both of which have argued they have firepower in reserve.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The market hitting new lows \u201cis possible\u201d, said Tom Clarke, who has a low exposure to stocks at a macro fund at William Blair in London.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But he added that government and central bank stimulus packages have \u201ctaken on almost mythical proportions. There\u2019s no doubt in which direction policymakers want markets to go.\u201d",

        "selftext": "The Oracle of Omaha has a reputation as the gentle GOAT, but is there more to this than meets the eye?\n\nIs there something that is often overlooked?\n\nOr is this reputation warranted? (get it...warren, warranted?)\n\nAnyway...Let's begin...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe story begins in 1942, when Warren Buffet bought his first shares at the age of just 11. \n\nThis is same year that his father Howard Buffett ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in the Nebraska district.\n\nHe won, and became a member of Congress in 1943.\n\nBefore this, Howard worked at a small stock brokerage firm.\n\nHe was reelected twice. However, in 1952, he decided against seeking another term and returned to his investment business in Omaha,\u00a0Buffett-Falk &amp; Co., where he worked until shortly before his death in 1964.\n\nBut what about Warren Buffett?\n\nIn 1951, after graduating from Columbia, where he was taught by Benjamin Graham, Buffett worked for three years at his father's firm as an investment salesman. \n\nIn 1954, Buffett accepted a job at Benjamin Graham's partnership, working as a securities analyst.\n\nHis starting salary was $12,000 a year - the equivalent of $114,000 today.\n\nHowever, just two years later, Graham retired and Buffett started his own investment partnership.\n\nHe went to his father's acquaintances to raise Capital for his first fund. \n\nThese were prominent families in Nebraska with big businesses and political connections.\n\nFor example, across the street was the family whose son became the CEO of Coca Cola - that family gave him $10,000.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn 2012, the STOCK Act or The Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act was signed into law.\u00a0 \n\nThe law prohibits the use of non-public information for private profit, including insider trading by members of Congress and other government employees.\n\nRemember, Buffett's father used to be in Congress.\n\n***The only people who were, before 2012, allowed to trade on insider information without having criminal charges brought against them were congressmen.***\n\nRemember, Buffett's father was a stock market broker prior to being elected and going to Congress, hence he had a comprehensive knowledge of the stock market and clearly had an interest in it. \n\nAfter all, it was his father who taught Buffett the ropes early on and had him buy his first shares as an eleven year old.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImagine you are Warren Buffett, and you can:\n\n1). Get insider information to trade on it;\n\n2). Get a six-figure position after College;\n\n3). After a few years, set up your own fund, getting money from wealthy family friends;\n\n4). Pay no dividends to investors and only put a hundred bucks of your own money into the fund;\n\n5). Let the mathematics of compounding work its magic as you bring in more institutional money;\n\n6). Become so connected Politically and connected on Wall Street that you can get special deals, which have practically no risk as you know bailouts are coming. For example, in the 2008 crisis, Berkshire owned stock valued at more than $13 billion in the top recipients of the TARP funds, and Berkshire had at least twice as much dependence on bailed-out banks as any other large investor;\n\n7). Have billions of dollars on hand, remember you aren't paying any dividends to investors, ready for the inevitable economic recession to hit so that you can sweep up cheap assets;\n\n8). Be holier-than-thou (i.e. calling derivatives \"financial weapons of mass destruction\" when, during the height of the 2008 crisis, Berkshire sold more than $2.5 billion worth of credit default swaps. OR what about Buffett's reputation as the saviour in the Great Recession when Berkshire is the majority owner of Moody's, who played a key role in inflating the crisis in 2008 - via their questionable debt and derivative ratings which inflated the mortgage and subprime market).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat about Buffett's status as the GOAT?\n\n[Jim Simons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcy8QaILDJI) has a far superior track record.\n\nBillionaire Chamath Palihapitiya has even stated that [Jeff Bezos is the best investor of our generation](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/12/chamath-palihapitiya-amazons-jeff-bezos-the-best-investor-better-than-warren-buffett.html#:~:text=Chamath%20Palihapitiya%20calls%20Amazon's%20Jeff%20Bezos,investor%2C%20better%20than%20Warren%20Buffett&amp;text=%E2%80%9CPeople%20used%20to%20lambaste%20Jeff,said%20on%20%E2%80%9CSquawk%20Box.%E2%80%9D), not Warren Buffett.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBuffett has missed out on an entire raft of tech and Berkshire has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 in recent years.\n\nBerkshire's best years are found overwhelmingly in the period before the tech era.\n\nAlso, he has been critical of Bitcoin, describing it as \"rat poison squared\"\n\nUltimately, Buffett is worth $73 billion, he doesn't need to have an in-depth understanding of new age tech.\n\nMoreover, Buffett has a huge stake in Finance 1.0, why would he give props to Finance 2.0?\n\nBitcoin as a savings vehicle is misaligned with Berkshire's don't-save-money-invest-it-in-us or consume more of the products of the businesses that Berkshire has a huge stake in, and is also misaligned with Berkshire's Cantillon insider advantages.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's worth noting that Howard Buffett strongly supported the gold standard because he believed it would limit the ability of government to inflate the money supply and spend beyond its means. Here is a direct quote from Howard:\n\n***\"I warn you that politicians of both parties will oppose the restoration of gold, although they may outwardly seemingly favor it,\u00a0unless you are willing to surrender your children and your country to galloping inflation, war and slavery\u00a0then this cause demands your support. For if human liberty is to survive in America, we must win the battle to restore honest money. There is no more important challenge facing us than this issue -- the restoration of your freedom to secure gold in exchange for the fruits of your labors.\"***\n\nHis son Warren, however, hates gold. See the [Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs) as to why.\n\n**Some have even argued that Buffett's success can be summarised by the following:**\n\n**First Deals = Insider Information**\n\n**Last Deals = Cantillon Effect**\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nIs it true... or false?\n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UpTUBgUYgc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UpTUBgUYgc)",

Last month THE OTC DAILY Interviewed Greene Concepts President and CEO Lenny Greene &gt;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ1V5OHkQrg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ1V5OHkQrg)\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/otc-daily-interviews-greene-concepts-140500143.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/otc-daily-interviews-greene-concepts-140500143.html)\n\n**Highlights from the CEO Interview &gt;&gt;**\n\n**Size of the Bottling Plant:** The size of the plant is 60,000 square feet. The company can produce water for other companies via third-party (white-label) manufacturing. Many other companies without a plant may have revenues of up to $30 million per year.\n\n**Quality Benefits of BE WATERTM:** Greene Concepts offers clean, pristine natural spring artesian water in an area cherished by many other businesses because of the favorable water supply. The water holds numerous health benefits to include healthy joints and bones, teeth and tooth decay protection and balanced pH levels.\n\n**Company Valuation:** As of May 1, the company share price closed at .0015 with a current outstanding share count of 862 million equaling a market cap of $1,293,000 which is very undervalued compared to the $3.29 bottling plant asset on the books and the $10 million company valuation in 2018 without a bottling plant at the time and a higher outstanding share count of a billion shares.\n\n**Company Goals and Vision for Success Over the Next 6 - 12 Months:** Finalizing 15 unique deals and taking steps to grow and proliferate sales of our BE WATERTM line. We will continue to expand our white-label production. Greene Concepts can develop scientific formulations for itself and for other companies such as an immune CBD. The company has also developed a complete 24/7 beverage line aimed at providing multiple beverage types for consumers from sunup to sundown. The company anticipates a future up listing to NASDAQ in the future for a win-win for everyone as strong sales begin and continue to take shape.\n\n**About the Company:** \n\nGreene Concepts owns and operates a bottling plant located in Marion, NC valued at $3.29 million which sources water directly from seven different spring and artesian water wells. The bottling plant's capacity is 8 million cases and 192 million individual units.\n\n$INKW",

Imperial Oil (an integrated petroleum company majority-owned by Exxon-Mobil).\n\n* Why you should invest:\n\n1. Expectation of recovery in industrials which will lead to increased consumption of petroleum products.\n2.

While they suffered a loss of 188million in Q1 2020 due to the OPEC spat, they have sizable cash reserve of over 1.7billion dollars and a quick ratio of 1.05. They are equipped to survive for the long haul.\n5. If you're into dividends, they're still paying dividends all the way up to March at 0.76/share.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Risks:\n\n1. V-shape recovery turns into a L-shape recovery and it turns into a long winter.\n2.

        "selftext": "The firm founded by famous bear Jeremy Grantham is worried equities are looking expensive as investors underestimate the coming hit to earnings. \n\nIf there\u2019s one number that Ben Inker is finding particularly hard to wrap his head around amid the COVID crisis, it\u2019s this one \u2013 6 per cent.\n\nThat is the amount by which analysts expect Wall Street\u2019s earnings per share to fall in the fourth quarter of 2020 from a year earlier.\n\nJust 6 per cent. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s how mild the market expects the impact of the biggest global economic hit in a generation to actually be.\n\n\u201cThe fourth quarter in 2019 was one of the best quarters ever for large companies,\u201d Inker tells Chanticleer from his home in Massachusetts, sounding more than a little incredulous.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether investors believe the forecasts they are looking at. I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to take it for the market to wake up to reality. And I don\u2019t know exactly what reality is going to look like.\u201d\n\nBut what he does know is that he\u2019s nervous.\n\nInker is the head of asset allocation at GMO, the firm founded by legendary British investor Jeremy Grantham, who is credited with warning of Japan\u2019s sharemarket bubble in the 1980s, the tech bubble in the early 2000s, and the conditions that led to the global financial crisis (GFC).\n\nA bit of the inherent scepticism of the investors they call the Perma Bear naturally flows through the value-oriented GMO and it\u2019s no surprise that the sharp rally in US equities \u2013 the S&amp;P 500 is now up 36.5 per cent since the market\u2019s low on March 23 \u2013 has forced Inker\u2019s hand.\n\nSo in the midst of the fastest bull market in history, GMO is retreating from equities.\n\n\nJeremy Grantham's GMO fund is pulling back on equities. Domino Postiglione\n\nFor its un-correlated funds (which don\u2019t use a benchmark to measure relative returns) Inker has reduced the net equity exposure to 25 per cent from 55 per cent. The equity exposure of benchmarked funds has been cut in a similar, albeit smaller way. Grantham is completely behind the decisions.\n\n\u201cThis was a big move for us and makes our portfolios look very different to most big portfolios,\u201d Inker explains. \u201cWhich is a scary thing to do.\u201d\n\nBut he says his team was guided by the simple principle that they wouldn\u2019t invest their own money in the market at these levels.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d rather take the risk of looking stupid than \u2026 be in a position where we lost the clients 30 per cent or 40 per cent because the equity market took another leg down.\u201d\n\nInker acknowledges that GMO, which reportedly manages about $80 billion, has had a difficult year, like many investors. Its value orientation meant it underperformed the market as it went down, but Inker says the firm\u2019s funds have largely kept up with the rally, which has limited absolute losses.\n\nGMO increased its equities position when the market was down 30 per cent in mid March, believing stocks were fairly prices for a downturn that would be about twice the severity of the GFC.\n\nWhere GDP fell 3.25 per cent during that period and took seven quarters to reach a new high, GMO expected the COVID-19 crisis to wipe between 6 per cent and 6.5 per cent from GDP, which would not be back to the new high until the end of 2021.\n\nAs such, GMO was banking on steady returns over the course of several years from its equities bet. What it got was what Inker describes as \u201ca monumental rally\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe got the returns we were expecting, we just got them an awful lot faster than we were expecting. And that started to make us nervous.\u201d\n\nGMO\u2019s view is that it is dealing with incredible uncertainty caused by \u201ca virus of which the world has a grand total of five months of experience\u201d and it cannot make post-rally stock valuations, even in the most optimistic of scenarios.\n\nSmall business key to cashflows\nYes, the Federal Reserve has taken incredible, and Inker argues justified, steps to save companies that would have otherwise become bankrupt through no real fault of their own.\n\nBut he doesn\u2019t believe it can stop the hit to earnings that will arrive when the US government\u2019s massive but limited stimulus runs out. \u201cAs we see it, the Federal Reserve can do a lot to help investor confidence, but it can do little to help corporate cashflow.\u201d\n\nThe big problem is small business. The business models of many retailers and restaurants won\u2019t work if they\u2019re only allowed to operate at a percentage of their pre-crisis capacity. Those small businesses employ a lot of people, and it will take a long time for laid of workers to get new jobs. That surge in unemployment can\u2019t help but hit corporate cashflow.\n\nInker faced another problem in retreating from equities \u2013 cash offered now risk, but also no reward.\n\nHis two bets are on emerging market stocks and particularly value stocks.\n\nIf GMO is wrong about the economy, and the recovery is V-shaped, then these value stocks should do well. And if the downturn is prolonged and ugly, Inker thinks he can still win.\n\n\u201cWe think we do have a pretty nice margin of safety here. Value stocks can withstand quite a bad economic outcome and still outperform over the next several years because there just so much cheaper.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.afr.com/chanticleer/rally-leaves-jeremy-grantham-s-gmo-nervous-20200602-p54ym8",

        "selftext": "Today we'll be taking a look through [PwC\u2019s Global Artificial Intelligence Study](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/data-and-analytics/publications/artificial-intelligence-study.html).\n\nLet's get started.\n\n**Part 1/6 - Overall impact of AI:**\n\nThe first real takeaway of the report is just how big of a game changer AI is likely to be, and how much potential value is up for grabs.\n\n***Global GDP could be up to 14% higher in 2030 as a result of AI, according to PwC research.***\n\nThis is the equivalent of an additional $15.7 trillion, therefore making it the biggest commercial opportunity in today's rapidly evolving economy.\n\nFor some context, this is more than the current GDP of Japan, Germany, India and the UK *combined*.\n\nBut what are the main drivers of this immense economic impact?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Part 2/6 - Productivity gains:**\n\nIn the near-term, the biggest potential economic uplift from AI is likely to come from improved productivity.\n\nThis includes the automation of routine tasks, augmenting employees' capabilities and freeing them up to focus on more stimulating and higher-value-adding work.\n\n***As many of their operational processes are highly susceptible to automation, capital-intensive sectors such as manufacturing and transport are likely to see the largest productivity gains from AI.***\n\nIn an increasingly competitive business environment, the impact on productivity could be transformative, and businesses that fail to adapt could quickly find themselves undercut on turnaround times as well as costs.\n\nTherefore, they stand to lose a significant amount of their market share as a result.\n\nOver the period from 2017-2030, labour productivity improvements are expected to account for over 55% of all GDP gains from AI.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Part 3/6 - Consumer Demand:**\n\nEventually, the GDP uplift from product enhancements and subsequent shifts in consumer demand, behaviour and consumption emanating from AI will overtake the productivity gains, potentially delivering more than $9 trillion of additional GDP in 2030.\n\nConsumers will be mostly attracted to higher quality and more personalised products and services.\n\n***This increased consumption creates a virtuous cycle of more data touch-points and hence more data, better insights, better products and hence more consumption.***\n\nThe consumer revolution set off by AI opens the way for massive disruption as both established businesses and new entrants drive innovation and develop new business models. \n\nAI front-runners will have the advantage of superior customer insight.\n\nThe immediate competitive benefits include an improved ability to tap into consumer preferences, tailor their output to match these individual demands and, in doing so, capture an ever bigger slice of the market.\n\nMoreover, the front-runners' ability to shape product developments around this rich supply of consumer data will make it increasingly difficult for slower moving competitors to keep pace.\n\nProvided they execute well, it is likely that the front-runners will have an unassailable advantage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Part 4/6 - Destruction...but opportunity:**\n\nIn terms of job losses from automation, the report makes the argument that new jobs will be created by the shifts in productivity and consumer demand emanating from AI, and through the value chain of AI itself.\n\nIn addition to new types of workers who will focus on thinking creatively about how AI can be developed and applied, a new set of personnel will be required to build, maintain, operate, and regulate these emerging technologies.\n\nAll of this will facilitate the creation of new jobs that would not have existed in a world without AI.\n\n***Although I agree that AI will result in the creation in new jobs, and differentiated skill sets such as creativity will be imperative moving forwards, I think it's likely that we will see a winner takes all economy, whereby the businesses who 'win' will employ more people, however their competitors will be forced to dramatically reduce their workforce and*** [***the overall trend will be destructive in nature***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nFbKzt-uwE)***.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Part 5/6 - Impact on different regions:**\n\nSome economies have the potential to gain more than others in both absolute and relative terms.\n\nChina and North America are likely to see the biggest impact.\n\nIn North America, the potential uplift to GDP from AI will be amplified by the huge opportunities to introduce more productive technologies, many of which are ready to be applied. \n\n***These gains will be accelerated by the advanced technological and consumer readiness for AI, along with the impact of rapid accumulation of assets \u2013 not just technology, but data touch-points and the flows of information and customer insight that come with them.***\n\nIn terms of China, the high proportion of Chinese GDP that comes from manufacturing heightens the potential uplift from introducing more productive technologies. \n\nIt is likely to take some time to build up the technology and expertise needed to implement these capabilities and therefore the GDP boost won\u2019t be as rapid as the US. But by 2030, the productivity gains in China could begin to pull ahead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Part 6/6 - Sector analysis:**\n\nThe report then looks at the potential impact of AI on different sectors.\n\nIt provides Scores based on PwC\u2019s AI impact index evaluation. Potential scores range from 1-5, with 5 indicating the highest potential impact due to AI, and 1 being the lowest.\n\nLet's look at the top three sectors where AI is expected to have the highest potential impact.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**In first place is Healthcare, with a score of 3.7**\n\nThe three areas with the biggest AI potential are:\n\nDetecting small variations from the baseline in patients' health data to support diagnosis\n\nEarly identification of potential pandemics.\n\nand imaging diagnostics (i.e. radiology)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe benefits here are obvious: faster and more accurate diagnoses, which would allow for earlier intervention, and more personalised treatment.\n\nIn terms of timeframe, medical insurance and smarter scheduling is ready to go.\n\nIn the medium term, data-driven diagnostics and virtual drug development are in the works.\n\nLonger term, there could be robot doctors carrying out diagnosis and treatment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA key barrier to overcome is the concern over the privacy and protection of sensitive health data. Also, more advanced applications (i.e. intelligent implants) will take some time to reach their potential and gain acceptance from patients, healthcare providers and regulators.\n\n***They then touch on a use case with massive potential: data-based diagnostic support***\n\n***This involves AI-powered diagnostics, which use the patient's unique history as a baseline against which small deviations flag a possible health condition in need of further investigation and treatment.***\n\nAlthough this will initially be adopted as an aid, the accuracy of the AI system will improve over time and long term it could operate autonomously.\n\nIt's worth noting that the global healthcare market is expected to reach $11.9 trillion by 2022, so whoever executes well here is going to be pretty high up on the Forbes List.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**In second place is the automotive sector, with another score of 3.7**\n\nHowever, it is ranked second as Healthcare is further along in terms of adoption in the long-term, and it is in the long term technologies where the greatest impact lies.\n\nThe three areas with the biggest AI potential are:\n\nAutonomous fleets for ride sharing\n\nSemi-autonomous features such as driver assist\n\nand engine monitoring and predictive, autonomous maintenance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe main benefit to consumers will be 'on demand' flexibility.\n\nReady to go:\u00a0Automated driver assistance systems (e.g. parking assist, lane centering, adaptive cruise control etc.).\n\nIn terms of timeframe, automated driver assistance systems are ready to go.\n\nIn the medium term, there could be on-demand parts manufacturing and maintenance.\n\nLonger term, there is the possibility of engine monitoring and predictive, autonomous maintenance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***The tech still needs development, for example it is more challenging to get an autonomous vehicle to perform safely under extreme weather conditions. Even then, it needs to gain consumer trust and regulatory acceptance.***\n\nAutonomous fleets for ride sharing is the high potential use case; this would allow people to access the vehicle they need at that point, and would be more efficient than the current system.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**In third place is the Financial Services sector, with a score of 3.3**\n\nThe three areas with the biggest AI potential are:\n\nPersonalised financial planning\n\nFraud detection and anti-money laundering\n\nand Process automation, which would apply to both back office and customer facing operations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor consumers, this would offer a more customised solution that would be integrated with others areas of their life.\n\nIn terms of timeframe, robo-advice, automated insurance underwriting and robotic process automation in areas such as finance and compliance is ready to go.\n\nIn the medium term, there could be optimised product design based on consumer preferences.\n\nLonger term, moving from anticipating what will happen (i.e. predictive analytics) to proactively shaping the outcome (i.e. prescriptive analytics) could reduce accident rates or improve consumer outcomes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe main barriers to overcome are consumer trust and regulatory acceptance.\n\n***Undoubtedly, personalised financial planning is a high potential use case - AI could allow clients to manage their finances dynamically to match their goals.***\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwTHGDDHMPc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwTHGDDHMPc)",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 8th, 2020.\n\n# **Look for the S&amp;P 500 to turn positive for the year with a boost from the Fed in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/05/look-for-the-sp-500-to-turn-positive-for-the-year-with-a-boost-from-the-fed-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to reassure markets next week the central bank will do whatever it takes to help the economy heal. That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting is the big event for markets in the coming week. There are a few economic reports, including inflation data, the consumer price index Wednesday and producer prices Thursday. Weekly jobless claims will be important Thursday to see if there\u2019s a drop in continuing clams, after May\u2019s employment report showed a surprising record gain of 2.5 million jobs.\n*****\n&gt; The reopening trade was in full swing in the past week, especially Friday when stocks surged on the jobs report, which was expected to show a loss of 8.3 million jobs. The Nasdaq broke above its record high set on Feb. 19, and the S&amp;P 500 was just 1.1% away from turning positive for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Even before the jobs report, investors were loading up on financials, industrials, transports and small caps, which were up more than 8% for the week and 18.4% in the past month. S&amp;P financials were 12.1% higher on the week, S&amp;P industrials were up 10.5, and the NYSE airline index jumped more than 35.4.%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think next week is dominated by the reopening and it will be for another month,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. \u201cWith cyclicals outperforming, small [caps] outperforming, credit spreads coming in and then the bond yields going up, everybody \u2014 all facets of the financial markets \u2014 are sort of suggesting the same outcome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 3,193, a gain of 4.9%, and now traders are watching to see if it can scale the psychological 3,200 level. The Dow closed Friday at 27,110, up 6.8% for the week, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.4%, at 9,814 after reaching an intraday record high of 9,845 Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts say the market will likely look past the protests that broke out in cities across the U.S. after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Four policemen were charged with murder in his death. Looters joined the protests, some of which turned violent, but they quieted down towards the end of the week.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher for a third week in a row, but a change this past week has been the abrupt lurch higher in Treasury yields. The 10-year rose to a high of 0.95% Friday, a quarter-point move in just three sessions. The move was already underway but got a lift Wednesday when ADP jobs data was not nearly as bad as expected. Yields ripped even higher after the May employment report showed the unemployment rate actually fell to 13.3%, instead of climbing to 20%, as expected by economists.\n*****\n&gt; Bond strategists said the Treasury market was now acknowledging the potential for a recovery, but not in the exuberant way the stock market has been. Since March 23, the S&amp;P 500 has risen more than 45%, but it took the 10-year Treasury until this week to get back the yield level it was at when stocks bottomed.\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen said he believes a new bull market has been launched, but there could be pullbacks and some headwinds for the market coming up.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhen GDP is minus 30%, other issues don\u2019t matter. There\u2019s just one issue. But as the economy reopens again, the trade battles will matter again, presidential politics will matter again,\u201d said Paulsen, adding the budget deficit could also matter. \u201cI think we\u2019ll get removed from a sole focus. That isn\u2019t quite there but I think it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed begins its two-day meeting Tuesday, and will release its statement Wednesday afternoon, followed by a video briefing by Powell.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhey would the Fed want to disrupt this with anything?\u201d Paulsen said. \u201cThey\u2019re still going to support the economy. They\u2019re going to stay away from negative rates or yield curve management. They\u2019re not going to do anything to scare the markets. They might certainly reassure people that they are still ready to provide support.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America, said the Fed may clarify where it stands on some of the extraordinary moves it has taken since it cut rates to zero. The Fed has been supporting the markets with asset purchases and multiple programs for commercial paper, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds, for example.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe think right now they\u2019re just trying to get this Main Street lending program to work. The question is are they going to do more things around what they do in terms of forward guidance and next steps of macro easing,\u201d Harris said.\n*****\n&gt; There has been speculation that the Fed would do some type of so-called yield curve control, a program to keep interest rates capped at certain levels. \u201cI think it\u2019s too early for that,\u201d said Harris. He said the Fed would be guaranteeing low rates for a long period of time if it does yield curve control.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYield curve control is basically open-ended quantitative easing,\u201d he said. The Fed is currently buying Treasurys but if it wanted to stop yields from rising too much as the economy improves, it could make targeted purchases.\n*****\n&gt; Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said it\u2019s possible the Fed could announce the yield curve control. \u201cWe\u2019ve said they could implement yield curve control out to three years,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my mind that matches the length of the horizon of the economic projections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Powell has said the economy needs more fiscal help, and he could reiterate those comments Wednesday. President Donald Trump on Friday said he backs more stimulus. So far, the Democrats have put out a marker with their wish list for further spending, but there have been no negotiations.\n*****\n&gt; There was concern the strong jobs report could make it harder to get buy in for another big spending package. But some economists say the recovery needs a boost and states need funding to fill the holes in their budgets from coronavirus-related spending and a lack of tax receipts.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7klaXQm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PKTBzT2.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/a5JkAB6.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/M2x4Qoq.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qtJYfXN.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bjiJWjV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UAi19KJ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GQm4ruO.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uV1U7FN.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/wm2XJND.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yarkiMO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hFblu2G.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Stocks Outpacing Analyst Price Targets\n\n&gt; This morning's jobs report shocked the financial world -- most notably the economists whose job it is to provide estimates. The consensus estimate among economists for May nonfarm payrolls was projecting a loss of more than 7 million jobs. The actual number that was reported did not just show a smaller than expected job loss, but it actually showed a gain in jobs of more than 2.5 million.\n\n&gt; We're seeing a similar situation play out in the equity analyst community. With the S&amp;P 500 now up 40%+ since its low less than three months ago, the average stock in the index is now trading above its consensus analyst price target that looks 12 months out. Analysts have simply not been able to catch up to the rapid rise we've seen for equity prices.\n\n&gt; It's extremely rare to see share prices move above consensus analyst price targets. We don't have the historical daily data on this, but anecdotally we can't remember a time when the spread has been this wide. As shown below, at the end of 2019 when the S&amp;P finished a massive rally, equity prices were 5.5% below the consensus price target. That was seen as a very tight spread prior to what we're seeing now. At the lows in March, the average share price had dropped all the way to $92.50 compared to an average consensus price target of $143.20. That projected a gain of 54.9% at the time!\n\n&gt; Since March 23rd, the average share price has risen from $92.50 up to $138.40, while the average analyst price target has fallen from $143.20 to $136. Current price targets no longer project a gain for the average S&amp;P 500 stock, but rather a 1.7% drop.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/avgpricetarget.png))**\n\n&gt; # Nasdaq's Historical Run\n\n&gt; At its highs earlier this morning, the Nasdaq Composite was within 2% of its record high from earlier in the year. Besides the steep V-shape of the Nasdaq's pattern over the last four months, the other aspect of the chart that stands out is just how steep the 50-day moving average is trending lately.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-50DMAa.png))**\n\n&gt; To illustrate just how steep the Nasdaq's 50-DMA has become, the chart below shows the daily percentage change of the 50-day going back to 1971. Currently, the Nasdaq 50-DMA is rising at an average of over 0.5% per day. That's an incredible slope and a level that has been exceeded only a handful of times in the Nasdaq's 50-year history.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-Composite1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Big Gains From Smaller Tech\n\n&gt; It's still difficult to fathom the moves in the US equity market over the last four months. The fact that the Nasdaq and more specifically the Technology sector aren't far from record highs is definitely something no one was expecting two months ago. There's an old market saying that equities take the stairs up and the elevator down, but in the latest market cycle, the elevator up was almost as fast as the way down!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Nasdaq.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Technology-Sector.png))**\n\n&gt; If you've been following the markets, all you've likely heard up until recently is that large-cap tech, and more specifically, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Facebook (FB), are single-handedly driving the market higher. The reality is not nearly as clear-cut. Given their market caps, the \"Big 5\" (as they're often referred to) have done a lot of heavy lifting, but in terms of performance, they're hardly the only game in town.\n\n&gt; The table below lists Technology sector stocks in the Russell 3000 with market caps of more than $1 billion that are outperforming all of the 'big 5' tech stocks on a YTD basis. Actually, since Amazon is doing so well relative to the rest of the \"big 5\" these are all stocks that are outperforming Amazon. If we looked for stocks that were doing better than the average return of the \"big 5\" the list would be a lot, lot longer (+16.4%).\n\n&gt; Looking through the list of names below, the two top-performing names are Zscaler (ZS) and Twilio (TWLO), which have both more than doubled. Behind these two, DocuSign (DOCU) and Sprout Social (SPT) are both knocking on the door of triple-digits. All 28 of the names listed have market caps of $1 billion, but the average market cap is just over $21 billion, while Nvidia (NVDA) is the largest company on the list with a market cap of $216 billion. For the most part, these aren't names that have been driving the indices, but anyone holding these stocks in their portfolio probably doesn't care!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Tech-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Best 50-Day Rally Ever\n\n&gt; In many ways, what we\u2019ve seen so far in 2020 has been both record-breaking and devastating. From the S&amp;P 500 Index peak on February 19 to the bear market lows March 23, stocks lost 33.9%. Now, 50 trading days later, stocks have gained 39.6%, for the largest 50-day rally since the S&amp;P 500 moved to 500 stocks in 1957.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere are no rollercoasters that can replicate what stocks have done so far in 2020,\u201d exclaimed LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHere\u2019s the catch though: Big 50-day rallies in the past have taken place near the start of new bull markets, and the returns going out a year were quite bullish.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 39.6% gain in 50 days was the greatest 50-day rally ever, besting the previous best in October 1982. What\u2019s important to note here is that many of these rallies took place coming off major market lows, and delivered quite strong returns going out 6 to 12 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/best-fifty-days.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Although we have near-term worries given this historic run, as some sentiment indicators such as put/call ratios are showing some froth, from a bigger picture perspective, this strong 50-day rally offers a reason to think stock prices may be even higher this time next year.\n\n*****\n\n# 2020 In Charts\n\n&gt; 2020 is only five months old, but in many ways it is one of the most historic years we\u2019ve ever seen. \u201c2020 went from moving along nicely, to seeing the worst recession in a generation and the fastest bear market ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cNow stocks are in the midst of one of the best bull runs ever, even though the economy remains extremely weak, thanks to record stimulus and hopes over a vaccine.\u201d\n&gt; \nTo best sum it all up, here are 10 charts that tell the picture of 2020 so far.\n\n&gt; 1.) The 2010s were the first decade in history to go all 10 years without a recession, which of course ended just months into the new decade, as the economy stopped. Stocks gained 13.5% on an annual basis last decade, surprisingly, only the third-best decade over the past four.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 2.) This is an election year, and the S&amp;P 500 Index hasn\u2019t been lower when a President is up for reelection since FDR in 1940. Although this seemed nearly impossible at the March lows, it is looking like this incredible streak could have a chance in 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 3.) One of the first signs something could go wrong in 2020 was stocks fell in January. Historically, this has meant potential trouble for the final 11 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 4.) As fears over COVID-19 gripped the world, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its fastest bear market ever, in only 19 days. To put this in perspective, this was the fastest bear market in the 124-year history of the Dow.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 5.) Mark Twain said \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes\u201d. Looking at history, every 50 years there has been a terrible pandemic and stocks fell more than 30%. We don\u2019t know if the ultimate lows are in this time, but so far, history is rhyming.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 6.) More than 20 million people in the US lost their jobs in April, while the unemployment rate soared to near 15%, the highest since the Great Depression. Record drops in manufacturing, industrial production, retail sales, and consumer spending have all taken place in the past two months as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 7.) A recession is here, ending the streak of 128 months in a row without one. What is unique about the previous expansion was nominal gross domestic product (GDP) grew only 50%, about the average growth seen during the previous expansions, but this expansion was nearly twice as long as the average expansion (10 years versus 5 years).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 8.) The bounce off of the March 23 S&amp;P 500 lows has been historic in many ways. In fact, it was one of the best 20-day rallies ever, with previous best rallies seeing strong returns 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 9.) As scary as it was on the way down, stocks have come roaring back, gaining more than 35% from the March 23 lows. This would classify as the greatest bear market bounce ever, which opens the question: is this more than a bear market bounce and instead the start of a new bull market?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 10.) The number of COVID-19 tests in the US nearly doubled in May versus what was seen in April. Additionally, fewer and fewer tests are coming back positive. Testing is one of the key ways we will beat this and this is a step in the right direction. We\u2019ve also seen new monthly lows in people on ventilators, in the ICU, and in hospitals.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Hard to believe, but there are still 7 months left in 2020. It hasn\u2019t been easy for any of us, and we continue to keep everyone impacted by this pandemic in mind, but we continue to see the glass as half full. The dual benefit of record monetary and fiscal policy should help create a bridge to help those most impacted, while the economy can slowly come back online later this year.\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$ADBE** \n&gt; * **$CHWY** \n&gt; * **$TIF** \n&gt; * **$LULU** \n&gt; * **$COUP** \n&gt; * **$SFIX** \n&gt; * **$LOVE** \n&gt; * **$NEPT** \n&gt; * **$GHM** \n&gt; * **$REVG** \n&gt; * **$GME** \n&gt; * **$HDS** \n&gt; * **$FIVE** \n&gt; * **$SIG** \n&gt; * **$CASY** \n&gt; * **$CVGW** \n&gt; * **$AMC** \n&gt; * **$FCEL** \n&gt; * **$QTNT** \n&gt; * **$PLCE** \n&gt; * **$CHS** \n&gt; * **$THO** \n&gt; * **$GCO** \n&gt; * **$BF.B** \n&gt; * **$LMNR** \n&gt; * **$WSG** \n&gt; * **$PRTY** \n&gt; * **$GES** \n&gt; * **$BBCP** \n&gt; * **$CONN** \n&gt; * **$HEXO** \n&gt; * **$PHR** \n&gt; * **$PVH** \n&gt; * **$RRGB** \n&gt; * **$PLAY** \n&gt; * **$TNP** \n&gt; * **$JW.A** \n&gt; * **$SB** \n&gt; * **$GSM** \n&gt; * **$SRT**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/bgPdMCr.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.8.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/d2EW1kr.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uxSiJJr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.9.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3SIjcG7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cRBrPlt.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.10.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DaheXAm.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9mcHxTl.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.11.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/i8SNjWM.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9xcBZPK.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.12.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Inc. $392.90\n&gt; **Adobe Inc.

        "selftext": " [https://oracledispatch.com/2020/06/01/gearing-up-for-the-pot-stock-election-run-mjna-crlbf-mctc-curlf/](https://oracledispatch.com/2020/06/01/gearing-up-for-the-pot-stock-election-run-mjna-crlbf-mctc-curlf/) \n\n \n\nThe 2016 general election November vote was one of the biggest catalysts for the cannabis space. 2020 is shaping as potentially another similar situation, with 4 states already on the ballot for legalization (2 for recreational) and another 6 states pushing to get on the ballot (5 for recreational), making it potentially even more explosive for the overall legalization movement than we saw in the historic 2016 process.\n\nThe rationalization for this last claim is about percentage change: the ultimate shift would be to get cannabis legalized on a recreational basis in the majority of the US, thereby putting pressure on the federal government to accept the verdict by states and start removing federal statutes around cannabis, which would likely accelerate the dominoes as a \u201ctipping point\u201d phenomenon.\n\nIn percentage terms, if all states seeking to get on the ballot for recreational \u201cadult use\u201d legalization are successful in doing so, then 2020 will be a bigger shift (provided they all pass) than the movement in 2016.\n\nIn other words, start getting your pot stock portfolio picks together ASAP. Below you will find our thoughts and analysis on some of the more widely discussed names in the space, including: Medical Marijuana Inc (OTCMKTS:MJNA), CRLBF, MCTC Holdings Inc (OTCMKTS:MCTC) aka Cannabis Global Inc. (OTCMKTS:MCTC), and CURLF\n\n**Medical Marijuana Inc (OTCMKTS:MJNA)** isn\u2019t what we would consider a \u201cprime investment pick\u201d in this space. The company has remained on the pink sheets, offering up unaudited financials only for all of its tenure as a publicly traded stock (and we\u2019re talking about years here), despite claiming tens of millions in revenues. In case you\u2019re wondering, this is not remotely typical. As far as we can tell, MJNA is the only stock in the history of the world that fits this description. And it\u2019s certainly not a reassuring idea. Why would you hide on the pink sheets and avoid producing audited financial reports if you are seeing such success?\n\nTo underscore this, the stock has done nothing but slide lower despite the company\u2019s proclamations of ever-growing revenues. Smoke equals fire. We would simply be careful with any company that seems to overpromise and overhype, and then claim the opaque lack of transparency afforded to companies trading on the pink sheets. While we have seen a recent spike following news that Aurora bought out a CBD name (CBD is the main focus of MJNA), we would remain skeptical that the long history here of underperformance in MJNA is likely to change on a sustained basis anytime soon.\n\nMedical Marijuana Inc (OTCMKTS:MJNA) bills itself as an investment holding company that operates in the medical marijuana and industrial hemp markets. Its products range from patented and proprietary based cannabinoid products to seed and stalk or isolated high value extracts manufactured and formulated for the pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and cosmeceutical industries. The company licenses its proprietary testing, genetics, labeling and packaging, tracking, production, and standardization methods for the medicinal cannabinoid industry.\n\nIt engages in the research and development of cannabinoid-based pharmaceuticals; and marketing and distribution of cannabidiol hemp oil-based products. In addition, the company provides management support and services to cooperatives, collectives, health and wellness facilities, and medical clinics; and consulting and securities services to businesses and individuals in the legal cannabis industry.\n\nIt\u2019s subsidiary, Kannaway, is a network sales and marketing company specializing in the sales and marketing of hemp-based botanical products. Kannaway currently hosts weekly online sales meetings and conferences across the United States, offering unique insight and opportunity to sales professionals who are desirous of becoming successful leaders in the sale and marketing of hemp-based botanical products.\n\nMJNA has been acting well over recent days, up something like 30% in that time. Shares of the stock have powered higher over the past month, rallying roughly 75% in that time on strong overall action.\n\nMedical Marijuana Inc (OTCMKTS:MJNA) managed to rope in revenues totaling $16.9M in overall sales during the company\u2019s most recently reported quarterly financial data \u2014 a figure that represents a rate of top line growth of -4.2%, as compared to year-ago data in comparable terms. In addition, the company is battling some balance sheet hurdles, with cash levels struggling to keep up with current liabilities ($6.2M against $11M, respectively).\n\n**Cresco Labs Inc (OTCMKTS:CRLBF)** continues to act like a new leader in the making, with an expanding footprint in terms of market density and geographic range.\n\nMoreover, this is a company very much tied to the process of gradual legalization in the US marketplace, with a widely known brand and a growing scale in terms of distribution relationships.\n\nCresco Labs Inc (OTCMKTS:CRLBF) trumpets itself as a company that manufactures and sells medical cannabis products in the United States. It offers cannabis dry flower; vaporizer forms of cannabis; cannabis oil in capsule, oral and sublingual solutions; cannabis in topical; and other cannabis products.\n\nThe company also provides cannabis infused edibles, including chocolate and toffee confections, fruit-forward gummies, and hard sweet and chews. Cresco Labs Inc. sells its products under the Cresco brand. In addition, it operators a Hope Heal Health dispensary in Fall River, Bristol County, Massachusetts.\n\nIf you\u2019re long this stock, then you\u2019re liking how the stock has responded to the announcement. CRLBF shares have been moving higher over the past week overall, pushing about 8% to the upside on above average trading volume. Shares of the stock have powered higher over the past month, rallying roughly 24% in that time on strong overall action.\n\nCresco Labs Inc (OTCMKTS:CRLBF) generated sales of $54.6M, according to information released in the company\u2019s most recent quarterly financial report. That adds up to a sequential quarter-over-quarter growth rate of 14.2% on the top line. In addition, the company is battling some balance sheet hurdles, with cash levels struggling to keep up with current liabilities ($70.2M against $194.7M, respectively).\n\n**MCTC Holdings Inc (OTCMKTS:MCTC)**, now doing business as Cannabis Global, Inc. (MCTC), has started to emerge as a new focus point for cannabis stock traders in the past few weeks. The company has been an IP leader, with a number of major patents related primarily to infusion technology for CBD, THC, CBG, and THC-V in the works. It\u2019s rare to see substantive IP as a factor in the pot stock space \u2013 most of these names are basically commodity plays \u2013 but MCTC appears to be the genuine item on that note.\n\nTo help reinforce that idea, the company just announced it has completed product development and has begun distribution of its unique tetrahydrocannabivarin (THC-V) coffee and tea products to product beta testers. This comes on the heels of news that the company has been approved as an Amazon.com platform seller for its Hemp You Can Feel branded line of CBD products.\n\nAccording to the release, \u201cCannabis Global has integrated three internally developed technologies into the unique manufacturing process for the industry\u2019s first THC-V beverages. The first of these is the process developed by the Company to produce 70%+ loaded THC-V, controlled release, nanoparticles utilizing laboratory-based, pharmaceutical-grade production equipment. The Company is also utilizing both its internally developed powerization and one step dosing system, ensuring precise dosing and significantly faster production. The Company has filed provisional patents on all three technologies.\u201d\n\nAs noted, Cannabis Global (OTCMKTS:MCTC) has recently filed six patents on cannabinoid extraction technologies and delivery systems. Management is currently working with patent counsel to protect various other technologies it has developed or is currently developing, including its programs pertaining to cannabinoid glycosides, polymeric cannabinoid nanoparticles and nanofibers, and its hemp extract-based alcohol replacement technologies.\n\n\u201cOur unique infusion and production technologies provide Cannabis Global with a product purity advantage as well as a clear path to low cost leadership,\u201d commented CEO Arman Tabatabaei. \u201cThe THC-V cannabinoids are synthesized and entirely free of impurities. While there were some upfront technology development and intellectual property protection costs, we expect our ongoing variable production costs to be less than half of any potential competitor. Via our technologies, we turn one of the cannabis industry\u2019s most expensive items \u2013 pure THC-V cannabinoids \u2013 into a cost-effective solution that sets a new standard for product purity in the cannabinoid-based products marketplace.\u201d\n\nMCTC Holdings Inc (OTCMKTS:MCTC) had no reported sales in its last quarterly financial data. In addition, the company is battling some balance sheet hurdles, with cash levels struggling to keep up with current liabilities ($157K against $1.5M, respectively).\n\n**Curaleaf Holdings Inc (OTCMKTS:CURLF)** shares have been moving steadily higher as the company continues to expand and solidify itself as one of the primary leaders in the space, particularly in the US market.\n\nCURLF shares pushed above their key 200-day simple moving average line two weeks ago, and have held up above that key technical marker on a closing basis since, with two critical tests, both passed nicely thus far. At this point, all of the stock\u2019s major MA\u2019s are curving into a bullish posture on a long-term basis.\n\nCuraleaf Holdings Inc (OTCMKTS:CURLF) promulgates itself as a company that operates as an integrated medical and wellness cannabis operator in the United States. The Company is the parent of Curaleaf, Inc., a leading vertically integrated cannabis operator in the United States. Headquartered in Wakefield, Massachusetts, Curaleaf, Inc. has a presence in 12 states.\n\nCuraleaf, Inc. operates 30 dispensaries, 12 cultivation sites and 9 processing sites with a focus on highly populated, limited license states, including Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York. Curaleaf, Inc. leverages its extensive research and development capabilities to distribute cannabis products in multiple formats with the highest standard for safety, effectiveness, consistent quality and customer care. Curaleaf is committed to being the industry\u2019s leading resource in education and advancement through research and advocacy.\n\nCuraleaf Inc.\u2019s Florida operations were the first in the cannabis industry to receive the Safe Quality Food certification under the Global Food Safety Initiative, setting a new standard of excellence. It cultivates, processes, markets, and/or dispenses a range of cannabis products in various operating markets, including flower, pre-rolls and flower pods, dry-herb vaporizer cartridges, concentrates for vaporizing, concentrates for dabbing, tinctures, lozenges, capsules, and edibles.\n\nShares of the stock have powered higher over the past month, rallying roughly 26% in that time on strong overall action.\n\nCuraleaf Holdings Inc (OTCMKTS:CURLF) generated sales of $129.8M, according to information released in the company\u2019s most recent quarterly financial report. That adds up to a sequential quarter-over-quarter growth rate of 30.3% on the top line. In addition, the company has a strong balance sheet, with cash levels far exceeding current liabilities ($251M against $177.1M).",
