I started with $100. \n\nThough the stock market can be unpredictable, and I'm down $150 this week on Ford, Six Flags, and AMC, here's what I've learned:\n\n1) Don't buy calls mid-pandemic that you're not selling that day. Most people who have made tons of money on calls in the past few weeks have bought them prior to one of Trump's speeches and sold them the same day.\n\n2) Don't buy calls when skilled fiction writers concoct a story about EOD green. When there are hundreds of people dying in Italy every day, worldwide border restrictions, corporation on pause, why the hell would you buy calls EOD?\n\n3) Don't panic sell your puts.\n\n4) Don't buy anything with no volume or a massive bid-ask difference.\n\n5) Before you buy something, just go to the news tab of Google and read the headlines for 15 seconds.\n\nAlso, the people who are actually good at this took their logo to the private sub. We're not getting that shit back.",

        "selftext": "February 27th I made a minimum deposit of 1K CAD into my portfolio. I had followed WSB for the past few months, but wanted to be responsible with the money. So I bought 100 shares of AMC at $7.05 (now trading at $2.47). After trading hours I started reading up on this thing called the coronavirus and found  evidence from highly reputable scientists about this causing a global pandemic.\n\nMany people on another forum I read started thinking this virus would cause a global recession and that it would adversely affect the travel, tourism, restaurant and entertainment industries. I found the scientific research credible and thought the conclusions of these posters logical. Someone on that forum had a large position in $RCL and I decided to sell my $AMC shares and follow his lead. I put the entire 1k into $RCL 80p when it was trading at $91. That day I made more than 60% profit and sold my position. It was an incredible rush and I felt ecstatic! I took a week off trading but continued reading up on the coronavirus. \n\nI eventually decided to buy $SPY 240p when it was trading at $310 and quickly sold those puts for 50% profit. Once again the rush I felt was incredible. I currently have $1100 cash and $4200 worth of options in the account. I've certainly sold too early at times, but I've still made an absolute killing!\n\nOne might assume that I've had a terrific time, and I have, but I can't overstate how much stress this experience has caused me. There's been plenty of days where my unrealized profits drop by $500 and I feel absolutely dreadful, countless nights of waking up at 3 am to check the futures, and my heart rate is through the roof every weekday 9-4. I simply don't think I can take this anymore. If this is what making money trading options feels like (for me) then I can't imagine how losing money feels. It's worth noting that I have Bipolar Disorder 2 and am much more sensitive to positive and negative emotions than the average person.\n\nFriday will be my last day trading, no matter what happens. I will sell off all my positions (except for a couple EEM puts that have a market value of $660) and try to avoid this subreddit. I would like to thank every single one of you for your information, camaraderie, and exquisite sense of humour. You've truly brightened my past few weeks, but my mental health is more important to me than money. \n\nIf you're struggling with mental health or gambling issues, I'm here for you.",

        "selftext": "Stock: [Costco (COST) - 315.02$](https://bcheights.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Costco-logo-01-678x381.png)\n\nDirection: **Mildly Bullish**\n\n**Price Target:** **320$**\n\n**Type: Put Credit Spread**\n\n**Fundamental:** Costco is one of the most respected and trusted consumer retail companies in the world. From sales transparency to its customer-focused business model, everything about Costco screams wholesome goodness. The market has rewarded this rare type of business with a monster 36 PE. (TGT - 17.5, WMT 22.23, BBY 13.8) This is really really expensive for a retail sector company. Costco pays a dividend of 2.60$. It has a relatively high institutional ownership of 70%.\n\n**Technical**: Priced above 20, 50, 200 day moving average. MACD shows bearish convergence. RSI shows around 50, coming up from oversold. Options sentiments are very bullish in volume and neutral open interest. Implied movement is 4.8% or about 15.26$ Short interest is at 1.1%, with 2.1 days to cover. Support at 306$, with all time high being 325.26$\n\n**Sentimental**: Costco suffered a steep selloff like the rest of the market. However, it has recovered 75% of the drop this week. One macro sentiment fueling Costco is the stockpile phenomenon. With coronavirus breaking out, many are going to Costco and purchasing out sized bulk goods in preparation. This should lead to an uptick in sales that will help Costco beat Revenue estimates. EPS may be affected due to sickness and preventive measures. Guidance might be affected as well, though I believe that has already been priced in. The main bearish move would be a lackluster guidance or missing EPS. \n\n**Robinhood (3/4/2020) Less Fucky. Not using. Moving to Schwab this weekend.** \n\n**Put Credit Spread 3/13**\n\n**Buy 295 Put**\n\n**Sell 300 Put**\n\n**Everyone loves Costco and the stockpiling will definitely help with sales. The real question is how Costco frames the future given the coronavirus risk.**",

        "selftext": "Stock: **Urban Outfitters (URBN) - 23.33$**\n\nDirection: **Neutral Bearish**\n\n**Price Target:** **23$**\n\n**Type: Call Credit Spread**\n\n**Fundamental:** Urban Outfitters has a great low PE and strong margins. Recently, it\u2019s debt levels exploded and cash-on-hand are dwindling. This paints a mixed picture of a company trying to transition through growing expenses. While last quarter and Jan sales guidance were lackluster, some of its non-core brands are performing quite well in their respective niches. Outside of macro issues, a key focus will be Nuuly, its digital experience.\n\n**Technical**: Priced below 20, 50, 200 day moving average. MACD shows bullish neutral. RSI shows around 35, oversold. Options sentiments are very bearish in volume and very bearish open interest. Implied movement is 9.8% or about 2.30$ Short interest is at 8%, with 6.1 days to cover.\n\n**Sentimental**: There are several macro headwinds that plague all of the retail sector, especially on their forward guidance. In addition, there may have been massive Adspend and development costs that will be factored into the earnings. Urban Outfitter\u2019s incredible margin is a bright spot in this muddy analysis. In addition, we will be updated on the performance of Nuuly and see if there are incremental gains and updated progress towards a digital transformation. I think the main bull thesis is the \u201clight in the darkness\u201d potential. If URBN beats really hard and everything else is red, there is a chance that traders flock over. However, any negativity or weakness will be exposed and drive stock prices down. \n\n**Robinhood (3/2/2020) Fucky.

        "selftext": "Hey fellow reddit people.\n\nI'm fairly new to the stock market and am just understanding basic market terms / vocab / processes. I've got a question for those more experienced than me w/ the current market if anyone can help.\n\nMy position -- I've got roughly 8-10k of creditcard debt that I'm paying off, though I've got low payments and I have roughly 800-1,400 a month roughly spendable after all of my expenses / liabilities / bills are paid off.\n\nI also have around 1000 in the moment I'm considering in investing due to the recent drop. I obviously know my position isn't perfect in life to start investing this as I have some other debts to pay, but my company is still up and running and i'm working from home so the market isn't killing me financially, and hopefully won't thankfully.\n\nI'm looking to invest this in stocks that have had the most drops that I think will bounce back. I know it sounds like a long shot for it to work perfectly well, but stocks suck as Norwegian Cruise Lines / AMC / Royal Caribbean / Carnival / Air lines as well --- Each of these have seemed to have dropped to near 20-30% of what they were in february.\n\nMy plan is to kind of wait until they hit a bottom of near bottom again as they did last Wednesday 3/18, and then start investing as much as I can in these and similar companies. Then I plan to continue investing over the next few months to build my portfolio and continue this, rather than work on paying down my debt due to this change in the economy that I believe I can benefit more in.\n\nIf all goes well I'd imaging I would wait anywhere from 6 months to 2-3 years for the market to bounce back and then sell to collect my profit.\n\nCAN ANYONE TELL ME IF I'M CRAZY OR IF THIS SEEMS SEMI LOGICAL? I feel like the mad scientist that hopes and thinks this can help me out in my position in life financially and give me a downpayment on a house in a few years if not more, and hopefully by then I learn a lot more and only invest better. I appreciate any advice, words of wisdom, and answers greatly. Thank you.",

Currently, OKTA is not profitable. OKTA has beat earnings 100% of the time for the past 2 years. However, the earnings performance was not always positive. This means that outside of beating earnings, OKTA must navigate both profit-collection and lackluster guidance. Okta currently does not pay a dividend. One risk factor is OKTA\u2019s D/E Ratio, which is 230+. This is incredibly high and poses a risk for long term OKTA holders. \n\n**Technical**: Price at the 50D moving average, below the 20 day MA and above the 200DMA.  MACD shows bullish divergence. RSI shows around 50. Options sentiments are bullish in volume and bearish open interest. Implied movement is 7.4% or about 9.56$ Short interest is at 6.6%, with 6.9 days to cover. \n\n**Sentimental**: Being an unprofitable tech growth company is current macro conditions is very risky. Extrapolating SPLK\u2019s earnings, we can say that the market expectations for profitable company was already very high. OKTA must continue its streak while proving that they can hit profitability. Any mistakes will be heavily punished. Currently, its EPS and Revenue revisions have been very bullish, in addition to a recent price correction from the 140\u2019s. While I believe OKTA will beat earnings, the guidance will not be bullish enough for the stock to pop. \n\n**Robinhood (3/5/2020) Less Fucky. Not using. Moving to Schwab this weekend.** \n\n**Call Credit Spread 3/13 - Easier one**\n\n**Buy 140 Call**\n\n**Sell 135 Call**\n\n**Iron Condors 3/06 - much riskier**\n\n**117/139, 2$ width.**\n\n**There are lofty expectations on OKTA right now and with the given environment, I don\u2019t think they will be satisfied. Profitability remains an issue alongside massive debt.**",

        "selftext": "Stock: **Square (SQ) - 48.30$**\n\nDirection: **Neutral Bullish**\n\n**Price Target:** **50$**\n\n**Type: Short Put**\n\n**Fundamental:** Nothing in Square\u2019s formula has changed since the start of the Coronavirus outbreak. **There is a note that due to the closure of many SMBs, Square\u2019s transaction count will be significantly affected.** Square\u2019s price fell from about 85$ to about 49$ in the span of the first Coronavirus slide, bottoming out at 32$, which was quickly brought up to about the 40$ average. Since then, it has grown alongside the rest of the market. Square will face very little growth for the foreseeable future, but can be a great candidate for covered calls.\n\n**Technical**: Priced below 20, 50, 200 day moving average. MACD slight shows bullish convergence. RSI shows around 40, coming up from oversold. Options sentiments are bullish in volume and Bearish open interest. Implied movement is a whopping 12.1% or about 5.85$ Short interest is at 7.83%, with 5.2 days to cover. Support at \\~41$, with 52w high being 87.25$.\n\n**Sentimental**: Square is a company that will not die. While the valuation was rich, Square was primely in the growth category, with its consistent revenue and EPS increases. The current coronavirus selloff has affected every stock on the market and Square was no exception. In addition, the recent purchase of Honey, alongside essentially halted SMBs, leaves SQ exposed to large risks. Analyst revisions have been entirely negative, as the outlook looks very grim. \n\nTypically in an elevated IV environment, sell-side earnings play becomes less effective. In addition, because of the current volatile macro environment, the binary event\u2019s sway over price points becomes mitigated as well, making earnings movement even less predictable. **I believe the bottom line here is if SQ moves against you, it can be beneficial long term to absorb the shares and sell covered calls as a way to generate cash-flow**. While this leaves many smaller trades on the sidelines, extraordinary times and risk management dictates safer plays. \n\n**Sell** \n\n**SQ - 4/03 $40 Puts**\n\n**4 of 5, Highly risky**",

I think the market is now understanding and accepting where we are economically and with the virus, and I'm not sure any other news will shock the market into panic selling again. The fed threw everything plus the kitchen sink at the market/economy and it seems that it has done a decent job of holding it in place for the moment.\n\nWhat I will bet on is that we will continue to gradually slide over the coming weeks and months. I do believe that the market will eventually hit down to a level near or at SPY \\~$200 level. If you plan on buying puts, I'd recommend buying them for April, but definitely May or June, with May being my favorite right now.\n\nSpecific companies are going to be more impacted than others. Six Flags (SIX), SeaWorld (SEAS), AMC (AMC), and separately Emerald Holding (EEX) and others in that space have already taken a beating. SIX and SEAS are great targets still because they have significant levels of debt and have closed ALL of their parks, thus providing $0 in cash flow. That is a huge problem for them. Companies like EEX, who operate trade shows around the country, and likely to be canceled for the foreseeable future. They are also in a decent amount of debt and the current structure of it for them is not at all favorable given the current conditions; I would estimate that this company will go bankrupt.\n\nHappy to answer questions.",

However, the hype and the demand both died down as reality set in. Tilray is currently cutting workforce as well, showing some weakness in its operation model. TLRY currently does not generate a profit, though it is look at 250%+ YoY revenue growth. Whether the market accepts this growth is up for debate, especially in current macro environments.\n\n**Technical**: Priced below 20, 50, 200 day moving average. MACD shows bullish convergence.

Continuing on the CGC thought process, the stock had held its highs for 2 days before it came crashing down again. I believe this is due to current macro conditions that hurts speculative plays such as cannabis and fake meat.

In addition, the recent purchase of Honey, alongside essentially halted SMBs, leaves SQ exposed to large risks. Analyst revisions have been entirely negative, as the outlook looks very grim. \n\nTypically in an elevated IV environment, sell-side earnings play becomes less effective. In addition, because of the current volatile macro environment, the binary event\u2019s sway over price points becomes mitigated as well, making earnings movement even less predictable. **I believe the bottom line here is if SQ moves against you, it can be beneficial long term to absorb the shares and sell covered calls as a way to generate cash-flow**. While this leaves many smaller trades on the sidelines, extraordinary times and risk management dictates safer plays. \n\n**Sell** \n\n**SQ - 4/03 $40 Puts**\n\n**4 of 5, Highly risky**",

From sales transparency to its customer-focused business model, everything about Costco screams wholesome goodness. The market has rewarded this rare type of business with a monster 36 PE. (TGT - 17.5, WMT 22.23, BBY 13.8) This is really really expensive for a retail sector company. Costco pays a dividend of 2.60$. It has a relatively high institutional ownership of 70%.\n\n**Technical**: Priced above 20, 50, 200 day moving average. MACD shows bearish convergence. RSI shows around 50, coming up from oversold. Options sentiments are very bullish in volume and neutral open interest. Implied movement is 4.8% or about 15.26$ Short interest is at 1.1%, with 2.1 days to cover. Support at 306$, with all time high being 325.26$\n\n**Sentimental**: Costco suffered a steep selloff like the rest of the market. However, it has recovered 75% of the drop this week. One macro sentiment fueling Costco is the stockpile phenomenon. With coronavirus breaking out, many are going to Costco and purchasing out sized bulk goods in preparation. This should lead to an uptick in sales that will help Costco beat Revenue estimates. EPS may be affected due to sickness and preventive measures. Guidance might be affected as well, though I believe that has already been priced in. The main bearish move would be a lackluster guidance or missing EPS.\n\n**Robinhood (3/4/2020) Less Fucky.

With the rise of Cloud computing, Micron\u2019s time to shine was finally here. Unless the supply-chain disruption was even harder than imagined, MU\u2019s value is very high. MU has recently drawn down their 2.5B credit in preparation for hard times. This will add additional risk to the debt side of things. \n\n**Technical**: Priced below 20, 50, 200 day moving average, surprising close to their 200DMA of 47$ and 20DMA of 44.66. MACD slight shows bearish divergence. RSI shows around 45, coming up from oversold. Options sentiments are very bullish in volume and neutral open interest.

        "selftext": "Stock: **Urban Outfitters (URBN) - 23.33$**\n\nDirection: **Neutral Bearish**\n\n**Price Target:** **23$**\n\n**Type: Call Credit Spread**\n\n**Fundamental:** Urban Outfitters has a great low PE and strong margins. Recently, it\u2019s debt levels exploded and cash-on-hand are dwindling. This paints a mixed picture of a company trying to transition through growing expenses. While last quarter and Jan sales guidance were lackluster, some of its non-core brands are performing quite well in their respective niches. Outside of macro issues, a key focus will be Nuuly, its digital experience.\n\n**Technical**: Priced below 20, 50, 200 day moving average. MACD shows bullish neutral. RSI shows around 35, oversold. Options sentiments are very bearish in volume and very bearish open interest. Implied movement is 9.8% or about 2.30$ Short interest is at 8%, with 6.1 days to cover.\n\n**Sentimental**: There are several macro headwinds that plague all of the retail sector, especially on their forward guidance. In addition, there may have been massive Adspend and development costs that will be factored into the earnings. Urban Outfitter\u2019s incredible margin is a bright spot in this muddy analysis. In addition, we will be updated on the performance of Nuuly and see if there are incremental gains and updated progress towards a digital transformation. I think the main bull thesis is the \u201clight in the darkness\u201d potential. If URBN beats really hard and everything else is red, there is a chance that traders flock over. However, any negativity or weakness will be exposed and drive stock prices down. \n\n**Robinhood (3/2/2020) Fucky.

Splunk sports a very high, but not astronomical PE, with decent profitability and a consistent record of beating earnings guidance. The recent acquisition (6 month) of SignalFx gives them further footprint in the booming cloud computing sector. An additional note is an announcement of a DoD contract with some huge numbers on it. While I cannot explain its actual effects, I do believe this is a positive for Splunk.\n\n**Technical**: Priced below 20, 50 day averages and below 200 day moving average. MACD shows bullish convergence. RSI shows around 48, coming up from oversold. Options sentiments are very bullish in volume and bullish open interest. Implied movement is 9.1% or about 13.85$ Short interest is at 4.6%, with 5.6 days to cover. One thing to note, the ATM straddle is actually getting cheaper, with a tiny IV contraction. While not a strong signal, I believe this is bullish for Splunk, as contracting IV is not a normality in current macro environments. The skew to call side reinforces this idea.\n\n**Sentimental**: Splunk has been beating and raising for more than 4 years. This track record of growth and performance weights positively. Analyst sentiments are bullish with a higher price target than SPLK\u2019s current price. Numerous partnerships with kings like AWS, CISCO, Accenture give Splunk a competitive moat. While not directly affected by the coronavirus, Splunk will need a massive win to command a big upward move. The main wildcard is the DoD deal updates, which can be a massive boost. Primary bear case is missing estimates and guiding lower.\n\n**Robinhood (3/4/2020) Less Fucky. Not using.

Currently, OKTA is not profitable. OKTA has beat earnings 100% of the time for the past 2 years. However, the earnings performance was not always positive. This means that outside of beating earnings, OKTA must navigate both profit-collection and lackluster guidance. Okta currently does not pay a dividend. One risk factor is OKTA\u2019s D/E Ratio, which is 230+. This is incredibly high and poses a risk for long term OKTA holders. \n\n**Technical**: Price at the 50D moving average, below the 20 day MA and above the 200DMA.  MACD shows bullish divergence.

Implied movement is 7.4% or about 9.56$ Short interest is at 6.6%, with 6.9 days to cover. \n\n**Sentimental**: Being an unprofitable tech growth company is current macro conditions is very risky. Extrapolating SPLK\u2019s earnings, we can say that the market expectations for profitable company was already very high. OKTA must continue its streak while proving that they can hit profitability. Any mistakes will be heavily punished. Currently, its EPS and Revenue revisions have been very bullish, in addition to a recent price correction from the 140\u2019s.
