        "selftext": "Been lurking here for a little while now while I\u2019ve been learning about investing and now options. I still have no idea other than the basics about options but I understand how buying a lottery ticket works. \n\nFinally opened an account earlier this week with a (very) small chunk of change. Most of it went to dividend stocks for long term growth but as they say you gotta risk it for the biscuit. \n\nBought 30 shares of NMCI as a long play but what I\u2019m really excited about is Seagate (STX). I definitely don\u2019t have the capital to invest in shares but I\u2019ve been watching it and I think it\u2019s gonna continue the steady rise it\u2019s on. \n\nWith how fast tech advances and Seagate\u2019s new Lyve Drive I think they\u2019re poised for some great growth. Anyways what do you guys think about STX? I haven\u2019t seen many people talking about it on the sub. \n\nSTX 15 Jan 21 67.5 C\n\nOh and Go Retards! Or whatever y\u2019all say",
