Semiconductor chips power the computers and technologies that are  essential to our modern economy and society. The proposed vertical deal  would give one of the largest chip companies control over the computing  technology and designs that rival firms rely on to develop their own  competing chips. The FTC\u2019s complaint alleges that the combined firm  would have the means and incentive to stifle innovative next-generation  technologies, including those used to run datacenters and  driver-assistance systems in cars.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe FTC is suing to block the largest semiconductor chip merger in  history to prevent a chip conglomerate from stifling the innovation  pipeline for next-generation technologies,\u201d said FTC Bureau of  Competition Director Holly Vedova. \u201cTomorrow\u2019s technologies depend on  preserving today\u2019s competitive, cutting-edge chip markets. This proposed  deal would distort Arm\u2019s incentives in chip markets and allow the  combined firm to unfairly undermine Nvidia\u2019s rivals. The FTC\u2019s lawsuit  should send a strong signal that we will act aggressively to protect our  critical infrastructure markets from illegal vertical mergers that have  far-reaching and damaging effects on future innovations.\u201d",

At this point, I\u2019m expecting Alibaba (BABA) to delist at some point. \n* As a reminder, a lot of times, when you buy Chinese stock, you aren\u2019t really buying a share of the company, usually you are being what is called an American Depositary Receipt, which is basically just a contract representing a number of shares, not an actual piece of the company\n* The Federal Trade Commission sued NVIDIA (NDA) to block the proposed $40 billion acquisition of Arm. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t look like the deal will go through given all the regulatory backlash in both the US, UK and EU. Sad for me, NVIDIA is my favorite stock in the market. \n* Ford Motor (F) expects to be the world's second largest electric vehicle manufacturer within two years, with annual production capacity of nearly 600,000, according to Lisa Drake, the Chief Operating Officer. \n* Shares of sport-betting company DraftKings (DKNG) sank to 52-week lows, losing more than 50% of its value in the last three months. Penn National Gaming (PENN) is following a similar trend. \n* Cathie Wood\u2019s flagship Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) hit a 52-week low today, after falling 25% in the month amid the broad tech-selloff. \n* Shares of Grab (GRAB), the largest ride-hailing and digital payment solution in Southeast Asia, failed spectacularly in its first day of trading following the largest ever merger, which valued the company at over $40 billion. Has not been a good week for foreign stocks.  \n* Qualcomm (QCOM) on Wednesday released a new chip designed for gaming-specific handheld devices offering 5G connectivity, a potential new mobile platform for video gamers offering more flexibility to play streaming games on the go.

At this point, I\u2019m expecting Alibaba (BABA) to delist at some point. \n* As a reminder, a lot of times, when you buy Chinese stock, you aren\u2019t really buying a share of the company, usually you are being what is called an American Depositary Receipt, which is basically just a contract representing a number of shares, not an actual piece of the company\n* The Federal Trade Commission sued NVIDIA (NDA) to block the proposed $40 billion acquisition of Arm. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t look like the deal will go through given all the regulatory backlash in both the US, UK and EU. Sad for me, NVIDIA is my favorite stock in the market. \n* Ford Motor (F) expects to be the world's second largest electric vehicle manufacturer within two years, with annual production capacity of nearly 600,000, according to Lisa Drake, the Chief Operating Officer. \n* Shares of sport-betting company DraftKings (DKNG) sank to 52-week lows, losing more than 50% of its value in the last three months. Penn National Gaming (PENN) is following a similar trend. \n* Cathie Wood\u2019s flagship Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) hit a 52-week low today, after falling 25% in the month amid the broad tech-selloff. \n* Shares of Grab (GRAB), the largest ride-hailing and digital payment solution in Southeast Asia, failed spectacularly in its first day of trading following the largest ever merger, which valued the company at over $40 billion. Has not been a good week for foreign stocks.  \n* Qualcomm (QCOM) on Wednesday released a new chip designed for gaming-specific handheld devices offering 5G connectivity, a potential new mobile platform for video gamers offering more flexibility to play streaming games on the go. QCOM said it partnered with hardware company Razer to create an initial test device for gamers.\n\n\u201cThe greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.\u201d *-Nelson Mandela*",

        "selftext": "Even after the surge this year, most of them are still trading at valuations far below other tech companies. Historically, it's a cyclical business right. However that is based on decades' worth of trends which have less relevance in today's economy. Semiconductors these days can turn profits rain or shine and the worst they encounter is a slowdown in growth. Not a surprise given the explosion of connected cars and IOT. Meanwhile software companies lose money for years at nosebleed valuations and no one bats an eye. Where is the logic. And why does NVDA get 10X the premium of everything else (GPUs yes, but the valuation is too extreme).",

I myself invested as much as I could into SOXX and well as TSM and invested some into NVDA. I am up approx. 16%, 4% and 110% respectively. When is it time to sell you ask? \n\nIn my opinion, for many of these, never. The only one I am considering selling is TSM, and that would have to do with the possibility of a Chinese invasion into Taiwan. SOXX and NVDA will not be sold by me for sure this decade, or probably the one after that. \n\nSeems to me some on this sub want to sell now because they have made say a nice 20% profit, which beats the market average. ~~If~~ when NVDA goes up another 100% in the next 2 years you will regret it in my honest opinion.",

        "selftext": "Hey there guys, I just started analyzing stocks more and I thought I\u00b4ll try to do that and post it here. That\u00b4s my first analysis for NVDA. If you have any feedback for me that would be great and highly appreciated. If you have questions feel free to ask, I\u00b4ll try to answer everything.\n\nToday we will look through the basics of NVIDIA\u00b4s business and then see if we can come up with a fair value for NVDA\u00b4s stock using discounted free cashflow.\n\nThis is not financial advice and I do not own shares in NVIDIA. Nevertheless I will try to stay as unbiased and objective as I can. Always do your own due diligence.\n\nFirst let\u00b4s review their different revenue streams. Their biggest stream, around **45%** of their sales comes from **Gaming**. The **Data Center** makes up around **41%**. Another **8%** comes from **Professional Visualization**. Then there is **3%** from **OEM**, and another **2%** from **Automotive**.\n\nFor the valuation:\n\nWe take **analyst estimates**, we discount that by our **required return of 9,2%**. Then we use the **perpetual growth rate of 2,5%** and that gave us a fair value for NVDA\u00b4s stock of **$327 per share**. But because we have to account for **NVDA\u00b4s equity** as well, our **fair value of equity** would be **$311 per share**.\n\nNow feel free to include a margin of safety to that.\n\nWith NVDA\u00b4s price being at **$326** **per share** right now, it\u00b4s kind of fairly valued. That\u00b4s why I think buying *heavily* might not be a good idea. Although you can always dollar-cost-average. That\u00b4s where you invest every month the same amount.\n\n**Where I see NVDA\u00b4s stock price in 5 years.** We can calculate where the price might be in 5 years with the **Earnings Per Share (EPS TTM)**, the **Estimated Growth Rate** and the **Future P/E Value**. With this method I get a stock price of **$868 per share** which is definitely higher than what it is now. \n\n**What I\u00b4ll do.** I believe NVIDIA is here to stay. I think they will stay for a long time and innovate even more. That\u00b4s why, although the price is not exactly where I would want it to be (I want to include a margin of safety), I will maybe start to **dollar-cost-average**. That way I won\u00b4t mind the volatile market and hold for the longterm.\n\nThank you for reading and I hope I\u00b4ll see you again.",

        "selftext": "To preface this, I'm only advising this for young investors, 18-25.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost of reddit is quick to recommend you throw all of your money into an ETF, but I disagree. In my opinion, ETFs are more for preserving wealth. Individual stocks is where you gain that wealth. When you're at a young age, your risk tolerance should be way higher than when you're in your 40s. I'm not saying gamble your money on a high-risk penny stock, but you should be putting most of your portfolio in individual stocks. Find a few sectors you like, and find companies within those sectors that have historically performed well and have positive earnings growth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will take 5 sectors and compare popular stocks within those sectors against the 1-year performance of the S&amp;P500 \n\nEnergy: \n\nXOM - 52%\n\nCVX - 28%\n\nCOP - 72%\n\nMRO - 151%\n\nSU - 45%\n\nTotal 1yr performance : 69%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIndustrials:\n\nLPX - 94%\n\nSEB - 17%\n\nOC - 20%\n\nBLDR - 104%\n\nNLSN - 15%\n\nTotal 1yr performance: 51%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinancial:\n\nMA - (-5%)\n\nSOFI - 57%\n\nAXP - 27%\n\nPYPL - (12%)\n\nV - (5%)\n\nTotal 1yr performance: 12%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShipping:\n\nZIM - 376%\n\nSBLK - 157%\n\nGOGL - 125%\n\nTGH - 87%\n\nSTNG - 12%\n\nTotal 1yr performance: 151%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTechnology:\n\nNVDA - 139%\n\nNFLX - 24%\n\nAMD - 63%\n\nNET - 124%\n\nINTC - (3%)\n\nTotal 1yr performance: 70%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Total 1yr performance of all these stocks combined: 71%**\n\n**Total 1yr performance of the S&amp;P500: 25%**\n\nPicking individual stocks nearly tripled the performance of the S&amp;P500 over the course of a year. While you did take on more risk, this should be considered encouraged at a younger age. As you get older you should gradually move portions of your portfolio over to more blue chips and ETFs. Anyways, I constantly see people saying only to put stocks into ETFs, but I'm curious to hear your thoughts.",

Bitcoin is a good example of this, nobody is buying up GPU to mine bitcoins; so assuming theres some huge future market for this is crazy.\n\nSo the real question is who can build machine learning and ASICS in the US, and offer it as an all in one solution to everyone?\n\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-darpa-structured-asics](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-darpa-structured-asics)",

        "selftext": "I'm pretty new to stock trading, so don't hesitate to point out anything I omitted that you think would be worth mentioning regarding Intel.\n\nSo Intel seems to be one of those tech underdogs who no one thinks will perform well in the future because they haven't been innovative at all in the past few years compared to companies like AMD and such. To me, this looks like a long-term buy opportunity:\n\n-  Financials look pretty healthy from what I know.\n\n- 2.80% dividend yield is a big nice-to-have if you're gonna hold the stock patiently for a few years.\n\n- P/E ratio is one of the lowest in the tech market right now, meaning that the company has a lot of room to grow if the expectations become optimistic. And in the case of a market crash, it would be one of the safest bets in the tech market because of its healthy P/E ratio (correct me if I'm wrong on this one).\n\n- They announced an increase in capital spending for the next year, so they are likely trying to get back the ground that they've lost in their technological advancement.\n\n- They're soon going to compete in the discrete GPU market too, so that can't do them any wrong.\n\n- With their own semiconductor foundries, they have an upper edge in manufacturing costs and can avoid a lot of supply chain related issues. And with the never-ending chip shortage, they might be able to make more chips at more affordable costs than AMD and Nvidia, who are bound in their production by TSMC's production capacity. Surely, their manufacturing processes are not as good as TSMC and Samsung's 5-7 nm processes, but it looks like they plan on catching up with them within the next few years. \n\n- They still have their place in the lower-end desktop/mobile CPU market, as their lower-end CPU's are much cheaper than AMD's. They offer the cheapest CPU's with integrated graphics on the market right now. Even if they don't grow anytime soon, I doubt they will run out of revenue sources, especially with the chip shortage going on.\n\nMy plan would be to hold the stock for a few years and cash in those nice dividends while waiting for the stock to become a growth one. I think Intel has already reached its floor price, and it would be very unlikely that the stock price goes any lower considering that it has strong fundamentals.\n\nWhat do you think?",

Semiconductor chips power the computers and technologies that are  essential to our modern economy and society. The proposed vertical deal  would give one of the largest chip companies control over the computing  technology and designs that rival firms rely on to develop their own  competing chips. The FTC\u2019s complaint alleges that the combined firm  would have the means and incentive to stifle innovative next-generation  technologies, including those used to run datacenters and  driver-assistance systems in cars.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe FTC is suing to block the largest semiconductor chip merger in  history to prevent a chip conglomerate from stifling the innovation  pipeline for next-generation technologies,\u201d said FTC Bureau of  Competition Director Holly Vedova. \u201cTomorrow\u2019s technologies depend on  preserving today\u2019s competitive, cutting-edge chip markets. This proposed  deal would distort Arm\u2019s incentives in chip markets and allow the  combined firm to unfairly undermine Nvidia\u2019s rivals. The FTC\u2019s lawsuit  should send a strong signal that we will act aggressively to protect our  critical infrastructure markets from illegal vertical mergers that have  far-reaching and damaging effects on future innovations.\u201d",

        "selftext": "Hey there guys, I just started analyzing stocks more and I thought I\u00b4ll try to do that and post it here. That\u00b4s my first analysis for NVDA. If you have any feedback for me that would be great and highly appreciated. If you have questions feel free to ask, I\u00b4ll try to answer everything.\n\nToday we will look through the basics of NVIDIA\u00b4s business and then see if we can come up with a fair value for NVDA\u00b4s stock using discounted free cashflow.\n\nThis is not financial advice and I do not own shares in NVIDIA. Nevertheless I will try to stay as unbiased and objective as I can. Always do your own due diligence.\n\nFirst let\u00b4s review their different revenue streams. Their biggest stream, around **45%** of their sales comes from **Gaming**. The **Data Center** makes up around **41%**. Another **8%** comes from **Professional Visualization**. Then there is **3%** from **OEM**, and another **2%** from **Automotive**.\n\nFor the valuation:\n\nWe take **analyst estimates**, we discount that by our **required return of 9,2%**. Then we use the **perpetual growth rate of 2,5%** and that gave us a fair value for NVDA\u00b4s stock of **$327 per share**. But because we have to account for **NVDA\u00b4s equity** as well, our **fair value of equity** would be **$311 per share**.\n\nNow feel free to include a margin of safety to that.\n\nWith NVDA\u00b4s price being at **$326** **per share** right now, it\u00b4s kind of fairly valued. That\u00b4s why I think buying *heavily* might not be a good idea. Although you can always dollar-cost-average. That\u00b4s where you invest every month the same amount.\n\n**Where I see NVDA\u00b4s stock price in 5 years.** We can calculate where the price might be in 5 years with the **Earnings Per Share (EPS TTM)**, the **Estimated Growth Rate** and the **Future P/E Value**. With this method I get a stock price of **$868 per share** which is definitely higher than what it is now. \n\n**What I\u00b4ll do.** I believe NVIDIA is here to stay. I think they will stay for a long time and innovate even more. That\u00b4s why, although the price is not exactly where I would want it to be (I want to include a margin of safety), I will maybe start to **dollar-cost-average**. That way I won\u00b4t mind the volatile market and hold for the longterm.\n\nThank you for reading and I hope I\u00b4ll see you again.",

In my opinion, ETFs are more for preserving wealth. Individual stocks is where you gain that wealth. When you're at a young age, your risk tolerance should be way higher than when you're in your 40s. I'm not saying gamble your money on a high-risk penny stock, but you should be putting most of your portfolio in individual stocks. Find a few sectors you like, and find companies within those sectors that have historically performed well and have positive earnings growth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will take 5 sectors and compare popular stocks within those sectors against the 1-year performance of the S&amp;P500 \n\nEnergy: \n\nXOM - 52%\n\nCVX - 28%\n\nCOP - 72%\n\nMRO - 151%\n\nSU - 45%\n\nTotal 1yr performance : 69%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIndustrials:\n\nLPX - 94%\n\nSEB - 17%\n\nOC - 20%\n\nBLDR - 104%\n\nNLSN - 15%\n\nTotal 1yr performance: 51%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinancial:\n\nMA - (-5%)\n\nSOFI - 57%\n\nAXP - 27%\n\nPYPL - (12%)\n\nV - (5%)\n\nTotal 1yr performance: 12%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShipping:\n\nZIM - 376%\n\nSBLK - 157%\n\nGOGL - 125%\n\nTGH - 87%\n\nSTNG - 12%\n\nTotal 1yr performance: 151%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTechnology:\n\nNVDA - 139%\n\nNFLX - 24%\n\nAMD - 63%\n\nNET - 124%\n\nINTC - (3%)\n\nTotal 1yr performance: 70%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Total 1yr performance of all these stocks combined: 71%**\n\n**Total 1yr performance of the S&amp;P500: 25%**\n\nPicking individual stocks nearly tripled the performance of the S&amp;P500 over the course of a year.

Sucks for me a little as I'm down 6% but I believe they'll continue to keep putting out great content and I don't see online content consumption reducing at all.

Already, we have seen those mid-cap tech stocks bleed as investors flock to the FAANG stocks. \n\nIf you look at the charts for the past two years or so, you\u2019ll see huge gains for practically every stock.

        "selftext": "I'm pretty new to stock trading, so don't hesitate to point out anything I omitted that you think would be worth mentioning regarding Intel.\n\nSo Intel seems to be one of those tech underdogs who no one thinks will perform well in the future because they haven't been innovative at all in the past few years compared to companies like AMD and such. To me, this looks like a long-term buy opportunity:\n\n-  Financials look pretty healthy from what I know.\n\n- 2.80% dividend yield is a big nice-to-have if you're gonna hold the stock patiently for a few years.\n\n- P/E ratio is one of the lowest in the tech market right now, meaning that the company has a lot of room to grow if the expectations become optimistic. And in the case of a market crash, it would be one of the safest bets in the tech market because of its healthy P/E ratio (correct me if I'm wrong on this one).\n\n- They announced an increase in capital spending for the next year, so they are likely trying to get back the ground that they've lost in their technological advancement.\n\n- They're soon going to compete in the discrete GPU market too, so that can't do them any wrong.\n\n- With their own semiconductor foundries, they have an upper edge in manufacturing costs and can avoid a lot of supply chain related issues. And with the never-ending chip shortage, they might be able to make more chips at more affordable costs than AMD and Nvidia, who are bound in their production by TSMC's production capacity. Surely, their manufacturing processes are not as good as TSMC and Samsung's 5-7 nm processes, but it looks like they plan on catching up with them within the next few years. \n\n- They still have their place in the lower-end desktop/mobile CPU market, as their lower-end CPU's are much cheaper than AMD's. They offer the cheapest CPU's with integrated graphics on the market right now. Even if they don't grow anytime soon, I doubt they will run out of revenue sources, especially with the chip shortage going on.\n\nMy plan would be to hold the stock for a few years and cash in those nice dividends while waiting for the stock to become a growth one. I think Intel has already reached its floor price, and it would be very unlikely that the stock price goes any lower considering that it has strong fundamentals.\n\nWhat do you think?",

Their biggest stream, around **45%** of their sales comes from **Gaming**. The **Data Center** makes up around **41%**. Another **8%** comes from **Professional Visualization**. Then there is **3%** from **OEM**, and another **2%** from **Automotive**.\n\nFor the valuation:\n\nWe take **analyst estimates**, we discount that by our **required return of 9,2%**. Then we use the **perpetual growth rate of 2,5%** and that gave us a fair value for NVDA\u00b4s stock of **$327 per share**. But because we have to account for **NVDA\u00b4s equity** as well, our **fair value of equity** would be **$311 per share**.\n\nNow feel free to include a margin of safety to that.\n\nWith NVDA\u00b4s price being at **$326** **per share** right now, it\u00b4s kind of fairly valued. That\u00b4s why I think buying *heavily* might not be a good idea. Although you can always dollar-cost-average. That\u00b4s where you invest every month the same amount.\n\n**Where I see NVDA\u00b4s stock price in 5 years.** We can calculate where the price might be in 5 years with the **Earnings Per Share (EPS TTM)**, the **Estimated Growth Rate** and the **Future P/E Value**. With this method I get a stock price of **$868 per share** which is definitely higher than what it is now. \n\n**What I\u00b4ll do.** I believe NVIDIA is here to stay. I think they will stay for a long time and innovate even more. That\u00b4s why, although the price is not exactly where I would want it to be (I want to include a margin of safety), I will maybe start to **dollar-cost-average**. That way I won\u00b4t mind the volatile market and hold for the longterm.\n\nThank you for reading and I hope I\u00b4ll see you again.",

I mean, we won\u2019t be seeing an \u2018everything rally\u2019 like we have seen the last two years especially. Already, we have seen those mid-cap tech stocks bleed as investors flock to the FAANG stocks. \n\nIf you look at the charts for the past two years or so, you\u2019ll see huge gains for practically every stock.

        "selftext": "I'm pretty new to stock trading, so don't hesitate to point out anything I omitted that you think would be worth mentioning regarding Intel.\n\nSo Intel seems to be one of those tech underdogs who no one thinks will perform well in the future because they haven't been innovative at all in the past few years compared to companies like AMD and such. To me, this looks like a long-term buy opportunity:\n\n-  Financials look pretty healthy from what I know.\n\n- 2.80% dividend yield is a big nice-to-have if you're gonna hold the stock patiently for a few years.\n\n- P/E ratio is one of the lowest in the tech market right now, meaning that the company has a lot of room to grow if the expectations become optimistic. And in the case of a market crash, it would be one of the safest bets in the tech market because of its healthy P/E ratio (correct me if I'm wrong on this one).\n\n- They announced an increase in capital spending for the next year, so they are likely trying to get back the ground that they've lost in their technological advancement.\n\n- They're soon going to compete in the discrete GPU market too, so that can't do them any wrong.\n\n- With their own semiconductor foundries, they have an upper edge in manufacturing costs and can avoid a lot of supply chain related issues. And with the never-ending chip shortage, they might be able to make more chips at more affordable costs than AMD and Nvidia, who are bound in their production by TSMC's production capacity. Surely, their manufacturing processes are not as good as TSMC and Samsung's 5-7 nm processes, but it looks like they plan on catching up with them within the next few years. \n\n- They still have their place in the lower-end desktop/mobile CPU market, as their lower-end CPU's are much cheaper than AMD's. They offer the cheapest CPU's with integrated graphics on the market right now. Even if they don't grow anytime soon, I doubt they will run out of revenue sources, especially with the chip shortage going on.\n\nMy plan would be to hold the stock for a few years and cash in those nice dividends while waiting for the stock to become a growth one. I think Intel has already reached its floor price, and it would be very unlikely that the stock price goes any lower considering that it has strong fundamentals.\n\nWhat do you think?",

Sales next year will include the rapid scaling of a higher value, high-volume PCIe Gen4 SSD controller.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Our customers have also provided us with purchase orders for the next year, and the order book today already exceeds $1.5 billion.** Our strong order book is a result of many years of hard work. No last minute opportunistic procurement audit of all the shelf parts by customers. We have been building our business pipeline for many years, leading to these purchase orders. Our OEM projects typically kick off one to three years before initial sales, depending on product capacity.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Already, our order book for next year is at least $1.5 billion, and our team is currently working to ensure we can deliver this. Next quarter, we will provide an update on our work. And at the start of next year, we will provide our official 2022 revenue guidance**.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I will say, our client revenue will continue to grow. Although PCIe Gen3 next year growth rate will be modestly, but PCIe Gen will grow very strong to carry because we have a very large design share in PC OEM. We stated almost 50% higher by end of the next year so that we have eight different customer, five on NAND maker with our PCIe Gen4 controller and ramping next year. For eMMC+UFS, we also will grow very, very strongly. It also depends how many wafer we can secure.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We say it's going not to grow for a certain level, **we guarantee is exceed the $1 billion of revenue next year**. But we think the backlog will continue to pile up by end of this year. But we'll continue to work very hard to secure more wafer, especially in mature technology because many eMMC are in 55, 40-nanometer and 28 meter, these mature technology wafer are in severe allocation from all foundry makers. So this is very critical, how fast we can porting, work with TSMC as well as other foundry that can grow overall the eMMC+UFS business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis guidance was confirmed on SIMO's [Q3 2021 earnings call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/28/silicon-motion-technology-corporation-simo-q3-2021/):\n\n&gt; In the third quarter, sales and earnings reached another quarterly company record. **Revenue grew 15% sequentially and over 100% year-over-year to $254 million**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We expect this situation of demanding excess of supply to continue through next year since foundry capacity will likely only start improving in 2023. Our order book remains strong and continues to be well in excess of $1.5 billion for next year.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;**In the third quarter, we delivered $1 billion in revenue run rate a quarter ahead of when we had previously communicated and expect our revenue run rate to increase further in the fourth quarter** as we focus on managing our product mix, customer allocation and pricing. We have already received foundry wafer allocation for 2022. **That is incremental to what we have this year, and we are confident we can grow ourselves next year toward our $1.5 billion order book.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I think based on the third quarter revenue and fourth quarter guidance, we are ready at a $1 billion sale revenue rate with our current wafer supply. We have already received foundry wafer allocation for 2022 as we state. **That's incremental to what we have this year, and we are confident we can grow our sales next year to around $1.5 billion.** We believe the demand will continue to exceed supply next year, but I think we definitely will continue to negotiate and discover TSMC to gain more wafer supply. Regarding the $1.5 billion backlog, I think we -- **our backlog remained very solid with the purchase order of 2022, continued to be well in excess of $1.5 billion**. Most of the backlog consists SSD and eMMC+UFS controller order \\[Indecipherable\\] 23:35. An OEM order is strong because our customers have been gaining share, and we have been gaining share of \\[Indecipherable\\] 23:41 as these customers. We believe we have secured about 50% of all PC OEM and PCIe Gen four socket for next year. But we have seen, however, some adjustment in our order book with the softening of order for channel market product and strengthening our product for OEM customer. For example, we are seeing demand for SSD by global PC OEM continue to strengthen, our current client SSD for retail market, especially in China, softening. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI repeat: management guarantees that revenue will exceed $1B in 2022.\n\nNow what do the anal(ysts) think?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-----\n\n**Analyst Estimates**\n\n* Morgan Stanley research: price target of $78 with only $1B of revenue modelled in 2022 / 2023\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zq7z1bccey281.png?width=473&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8fe6bf8cde6597ea7db096112c377fa7771dd3c3\n\n* Bank of America research: price target of $80 with only \\~$850M of revenue modelled in 2022 / 2023\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ia6skvysey281.png?width=502&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f326906c0291c5bf0a9323ae7a3f7a1ecb52418b\n\nNeedham is the only analyst properly reflecting $1.5B of revenue in 2022.
