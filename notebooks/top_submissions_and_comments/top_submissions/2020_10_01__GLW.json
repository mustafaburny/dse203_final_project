        "selftext": "Probably not the best DD ever seen on this thread, but lets start with my creds. I'm an engineer with a small national ISP that runs fiber-optic based cabling for all our operations. Over the past 12 months, most industries have been hit hard with COVID complications, but the ISP industry is growing massively. Companies are requiring faster internet for WFH roles, and remote education has skyrocketed. As such, almost every ISP across the nation has been growing their network at a rapid pace, and fiber backbones are essential to the roll out of 5G services across the nation. \n\nWhen it comes to on-pole and in-ground fiber optic cables (which can get incredibly pricey), there is one name in the game and it is Corning (Ticker GLW). Our small company has been buying parking lots full of fiber reels for months now, and my contacts at similar businesses across the US and Canada agree, business is booming for Corning. \n\nEarnings are coming 10/27, and they have outpaced expectations for the past 4 cycles, with Q2 over doubling the estimate. As such, I think earnings pushing the stock to $40 is a sure bet, and the calls are cheap enough to buy a significant amount without incurring too much risk, or you can YOLO like the autists I know you are. \n\nPosistion: 300 $40c 10/30",

        "selftext": "I am relatively new to the investing world, having started in Jan this year, so feel free to lay some knowledge on me. I have recently been riding the Green Energy/Tech waves up and would like to rotate a little into some more unloved stocks with decent potential.\n\nIt seems reasonable to assume the next phase of the pandemic (next 6 months or so) could be the release of a vaccine and the huge challenge of distributing it to the masses. One of the biggest hurdles to mass vaccination is the lack of medical grade glass used in manufacturing vials. Of current interest to me is Corning Inc (NYSE:GLW), who in 2017 finished development of Corning Valour Glass which is said to be superior to Borosilicate containers (which are currently used most widely). In May 2020 Pfizer signed a multi year deal to be supplied with Corning\u2019s Valour Glass, and a month later Corning received $204mil from US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to expand domestic manufacturing of Valor glass vials to hold COVID-19 vaccines. This helped push Corning to a Q2 earnings beat of 76%. It has rallied around 80% from its March lows but is yet to surpass its ATH. \nIt\u2019s not exactly cheap at the moment with a P/E of 34, but considering there will be a need for billions of vials for the next few years at least, it could be one to watch. \n\nThis is by no means investment advice, it is just my own opinion (and probably not a very good one)\n\nIs anyone else currently looking at rotating?

        "selftext": "I sold my NET stock few days ago with good profit (at around 57$, 87% up), and I have about 10K worth of WCLD. I was looking into all the holdings of WCLD, and I was surprised there is no akamai (check [https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/thematic/wcld](https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/thematic/wcld)).\n\nI started digging and I came across this very good comparison of the major cloud companies:\n\n[https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/maxcdn-vs-cloudflare-vs-cloudfront-vs-akamai-edge-vs-fastly/](https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/maxcdn-vs-cloudflare-vs-cloudfront-vs-akamai-edge-vs-fastly/)\n\nas you can see, it seems akamai has like 55% of market share, while NET and FASTLY are around 1%. The blog was from July, but I don't think things have changed dramatically since then. \n\nFrom reading the blog, it seems to me for big companies, akam seems to be the first choice for the biggest websites (facebook, adobe, ibm, to mention few).\n\nThen I started looking into the valuations, and I found this article from today comparing Akamai and Fastly\n\n[https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/15/forget-fastly-this-edge-computing-rival-is-the-bet/?source=iedfolrf0000001](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/15/forget-fastly-this-edge-computing-rival-is-the-bet/?source=iedfolrf0000001)\n\nIt was very eye opening, specially, the following table below  (Revenue and operating income are Guidances for 2020)\n\n    Company | Revenue | Operating Income  | Mkt Cap | P/S  | P/E   |  P/E (forward)\n    ---------|----------|-----------------|---------| ---- | ------|-----------------\n    FSLY  | $295 M |$7 million| $14.5 B | 54.0 | N/A  | 1,110\n    AKAM  | $3,150 M |$961 million| $18.8 B | 6.1 | 35  | 20.3\n\nThere is another table shown the revenue growth, where FSLY obviously have better figure (62% Q2 revenue growth for FSLY vs 13% for Akam), but Akam is still doing better when you look into margins \n\nI know the cloud market is growing, and Akam will not be able to keep the 55% market share. But still, how come it is almost not discussed here?\n\nSo after this quick research, I am thinking of buying a good 4-6K worth of Akamai. Any reasons why I shouldn't do that?  \n\nPS: Fsly, even after the big drops today and yesterday, is still up around 350% YTD, on the other hand, AKAM is only 26% up (NET is around 250% up YTD)",

        "selftext": "After sneaky WSJ reported \"talks\" of AMD buying Xilinx, we saw roughly a 17% jump in XLNX and a 2% drop in AMD from pre-market to market-open on 10/9.  That jump caught every fucking investing blog and finance news website's attention and by noon:o'clock there were about 20+ articles parading around like this was the biggest news since the Trump got Covid.  Here is why this AMD acquisition will never happen:\n\n/AMD DEBT/\n\nAMD cannot afford it.  They don't have enough cash on hand to make a $30billion deal\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-09/amd-ceo-tries-to-banish-debt-ridden-deal-ghosts-with-xilinx-bid](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-09/amd-ceo-tries-to-banish-debt-ridden-deal-ghosts-with-xilinx-bid)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n/Xilinx's Business Model/\n\nXilinx may simply be trying to get acquired and are leaking rumors to get the fire started. See what companies they work with and see the data for yourself here:\n\n[https://csimarket.com/stocks/markets\\_glance.php?code=XLNX](https://csimarket.com/stocks/markets_glance.php?code=XLNX) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n/Xilinx Price Tag/\n\n$30billion offering is already out of AMD's reach (as you can see from the valuations from the articles above). If Xilinx is truly interested in selling their company, then will likely open their doors to other tech giants who will pay more and have a better handle on the sector.  These rumored \"talks\" drive up share value as you have already seen and, if they're smart, they won't sell to anyone... just take the overvaluation and strike up exclusive contracts with all the competing companies who try and buy them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, neither company would even comment on it.  AMD has been aggressive with their business since the induction of their newest CEO.  IMO this was a leak from AMD to illicit conversations with XLNX, but XLNX is too smart to let a company like AMD to swoop them up, even if AMD is trying to play the \"Fuck IBM\" card to pander them into an ethical agreement - or - this was a strategic move by XLNX to start a bidding war over their already stable company because they hit a ceiling in their profit model.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWho knows tho, it's all rumors anyways\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: IDK wtf I'm talking about, but I can say that neither does anyone else on this matter except for our beloved sneaky-ass AMD/XLNX execs \n\n//\n\nAMD $80c 10/16\n\nXLNX $120p 10/16\n\nAVT $27c 2/19",

        "selftext": "From: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ibm-divestiture-idINKBN26T1TZ\n\n(Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp is splitting itself into two public companies, capping a years-long effort by the world\u2019s first big computing firm to diversify away from its legacy businesses to focus on high-margin cloud computing.\n\nIBM will list its IT infrastructure services unit, which provides technical support for 4,600 clients in 115 countries and has a backlog of $60 billion, as a separate company with a new name by the end of 2021.\n\nThe new company will have 90,000 employees and its leadership structure will be decided in a few months, Chief Financial Officer James Kavanaugh told Reuters.\n\nIBM, which currently has more than 352,000 workers, said it expects to record nearly $5 billion in expenses related to the separation and operational changes.\n\nInvestors cheered the surprise move by Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna, the key architect behind IBM\u2019s $34 billion acquisition of cloud company Red Hat last year, sending the company\u2019s shares up 7%.\n\n\u201cWe divested networking back in the \u201890s, we divested PCs back in the 2000s, we divested semiconductors about five years ago because all of them didn\u2019t necessarily play into the integrated value proposition,\u201d Krishna said on a call with analysts.\n\nBIG BLUE\u2019S NEW FOCUS\n\nIn a blog, Krishna called the move a \u201csignificant shift\u201d in the 109-year-old company\u2019s business model.\n\n\u201cIBM is essentially getting rid of a shrinking, low-margin operation given the cannibalizing impact of automation and cloud, masking stronger growth for the rest of the operation,\u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Moshe Katri said.\n\nIBM, which has sought to make up for slowing software sales and seasonal demand for its mainframe servers, said it would now focus on open hybrid cloud and AI solutions that will account for more than half of its recurring revenues.\n\nKrishna, who replaced Ginni Rometty as CEO in April, said IBM\u2019s software and solutions portfolio would account for the majority of company revenue after the separation.\n\nThe company also said it expects third-quarter revenue of $17.6 billion and an adjusted profit per share of $2.58, roughly in line with Street estimates.",

There for most major companies will be more inclined to robots and artificial intelligence \n\nPlus they are makeing good amount of earnings during the pandemic \n\nPlus you don\u2019t have to pay taxes for employing artificial intelligence\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\n\n\nEdit:If you know a stock that is better or equivalent then by all means do tell cuz they ain\u2019t one.\n\nEdit : bill gates and Steve Jobs stole software ideas from ibm and became billionaires. \nGood software can make you a billionaire due to the fact that once made it copied and pasted very cheaply and sold at a high markup such as video games and computer virus protection and most importantly WINDOWS PC UI and APPLE PC UI\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not saying buy the stock because I actually waiting for the dip I\u2019m hoping the stock won\u2019t go up but down\n\nEdit: When you walk down the street do you see IBM on the street or when you drive or when you go to the store no they are not a consumer goods product but corporate product. \nPandemic happens corporations cut costs and restructure most companies will want to have less human work force thus AI will take over go to Walmart and look at the self checkout or when you go to a amazon warehouse tell me what you see boy.\n\nEdit: the power of well know product goods in the software community such as\n-oracle\n-snowflake\n-google whom is creating a quantum computer \n-Amazon Relational Database Serves\n-IBM\nWhy is this important because big corporations like to associate with other big corporations \nSuch as apple buys oled screens from Samsung",

        "selftext": "\n \nFor Trading October 9th\n   \nSolid Day\n \nIBM Soars, DPZ Crushed\n \n \nToday\u2019s market was just a good, old-fashioned day without any major moves in the indexes, no earth-shattering tweets or end of days prognostications.  I didn\u2019t have any power, cable or phone last night so besides not putting out my Daily Note or closing comment, I miss the big debate.  Judging by the reports I heard today, all I missed was the fly on Pence\u2019s head!  The DJIA was = 122.06 (.43%), NASDAQ +56.38 (.50%), S&amp;P 500 +27.38 (.80%), the Russell was the big winner again +17.51 (1.09%) and the Transports +72.54 (.62%) and a new all-time high!  The internals were good with NYSE 3:1 and NASDAQ 2:1 positive and all I can say is that it was very a very \u201cGoldilocks\u201d kind of day.\n\nLooking at adding NEM and GLD calls, and a reentry into CVS and UNG calls probably...\n                                                                                                                           \nTonight\u2019s closing comment video: https://youtu.be/lXD_OB9CrYU\n \nSECTORS:  There was good news for holders of Eaton Vance (EV) being taken over by Morgan Stanley (MS) for about $7 billion in cash and stock.  MS was -2.20 premarket but right after the open it started back up and finished $49.35 +.64, and since it included stock, the rise sent EV higher to close $60.78 +19.84 (48.4%).  \nIBM also had news that sent it higher.  They gave guidance and then announced that they are going to split the company up and make the pieces \u201cpure plays\u201d in an effort to get a better valuation for the parts.  It looked great pre-market but by the open it had given up about 1/3 of the gains and finished the day up $7.42 (6%) after the early market up 12%.  Same situation with REGN, trading up to $618 or so +$26, but the stock never made it there when the real market opened\u2026and then traded back to $598 and closed $599.70 +8.00, near the lows, but still ahead 1.24%.\nOn the downside, the DISASTER DU JOUR, was a name that I wrote about last week, WWR, Westwater Resources, which went from $1.52 to $14.50 on news that Mr. Trump had signed an executive order relating to securing \u201crare earth\u201d and critical minerals last week.  As I mentioned, the stock took off from under $2 to $14.50 in 4 days and then reversed and finished the day $7.46 -4.26 (36%).\n \nNew Group:\nAIR &amp; CRUISE LINES were HIGHER with CCL -.22, RCL +1.48, NCLH +.28, AAL +.33, DAL +.67, LUV +.57, UAL +1.06, HA +.55, ALK +1.98, and XTN $61.54 +.77 (1.27%).\n \nFOOD SUPPLY CHAIN was MIXED with TSN +.57, BOS +.03, FLO -.08, CPB +.48, CAG -.35,M MDLZ +.38, KHC +.36, CALM -.14, JJSF -.02, SAFM -1.59, HRL -.23, SJM -.33, PPC -.21, KR +.36, and PBJ $33.64 +.11 (.34%).\n \nBIOPHARMA was HIGHER with BIIB +1.89, ABBV +.56, REGN +3.87, ISRG +2.74, GILD +.83, MYL +.83, TEVA +.35, VRTX +2.71, BHC +2.12, INCY +3.09, ICPT -2.46, LABU +.74 and IBB $141.38 +.39 (.28%).\nCANNABIS: was HIGHER with the comment in last night\u2019s debate that Kamala Harris that they would legalize pot.

After breaking out over $10,000 we have had a \u201crunning correction\u201d pushing prices toward $12,000, reaching a recovery high of $12220 Thursday, and after a day of rest in between, we resumed the rally touching $12,635, but have sold off back to support. We had 750 shares of GBTC and sold off 250 last week at $13.93 and still have 500 with a cost of $8.45. GBTC closed $11.86 +.89 today.\n \n Tomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

Energy, financials, materials some of the leaders. Tech, industrials, consumer discretionary trailing. Treasuries mostly firmer with curve flattening after another steepening move yesterday.

Still a lot of concern about rising Covid new-case levels in Europe (and increasingly in the US). However, **vaccine/treatment optimism theme** helped by Trump talking up his **positive experience with REGN's antibody cocktail**.\n* Analyst takeaways from yesterday's FOMC minutes note the degree to which **policymakers have baked more stimulus into their economic forecasts** and notes that **the Fed might turn to more explicit guidance on QE at future meetings**.
