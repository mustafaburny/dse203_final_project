        "selftext": "I get in the market at August's ATH like the NPC that I am. I bought only tech, because of course. MU, NIO, AMD, ATVI, TSLA. Then they all drop, I panic sell TSLA at near bottom 350, losing $100/share. I hold the rest, because this is somehow a tactic. \n\nI get rid of AMD at break even recently, same for ATVI. I sell MU at like $1 less a share because I'm tired of seeing this stock and its wonky-ass graph. Fuck MU seriously, it goes down a lot when everything goes down, and down a little when everything goes up.\n\nLast week, I decide to move funds outta that account to an other broker/acct type because I tried to day-trade with a $10/trade commission with TDA because yes on top of all of this \"condition\" I'm Canadian and TD charges us that much. Now I'm with IB, ugly as shit interface but dirt cheap commissions, not gonna stop my fails tho, just facilitate them.\n\nSold TSLA 440 Oct23 Puts few days ago and am looking forward to it fucking me pretty bad any moment now.",

        "selftext": "## Daily Synopsis \n* The S&amp;P 500 -0.06% today while the NASDaq decreased by (-0.62%). The Russell 2000 closed lower by (-0.25%). The Dow ended in positive territory at (+0.33%)\n* The best performing sector was Utilities(+1.07%) while Energy(-2.27%)was the worst performer.\n* The energy sector (-2.3%) and Dow Jones Transportation Average (-1.3%) were consistent laggards today amid disappointing reactions to mixed earnings reports from Schlumberger (SLB 14.97, -1.45, -8.8%), J.B. Hunt Transport (JBHT 128.04, -13.80, -9.7%), and Kansas City Southern (KSU 179.01, -5.00, -2.7%). \n* The weakness in the transportation space was mitigated in the industrials sector (+0.7%) by nice gains in Boeing (BA 167.35, +3.11, +1.9%) and Caterpillar (CAT 168.75, +3.71, +2.3%). Boeing's 737 MAX was deemed safe to fly by EU regulators, and CAT was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Wells Fargo.\n* Evidently, the session was mixed with conflicting trading narratives that made it hard to identify a clear theme. It was a stock picker's kind of day and certainly one for options traders amid monthly options expiration activity. \n* Looking ahead, investors will receive the NAHB Housing Market Index for October on Monday. \n## Index Summary\n &lt;b&gt;S&amp;P 500 :&lt;/b&gt; (-0.06%); &lt;b&gt;NasDaq : &lt;/b&gt;(-0.62%); \\\n&lt;b&gt;Russell 2000 :&lt;/b&gt;(-0.25%); &lt;b&gt;Dow :&lt;/b&gt;(+0.33%); \\\n&lt;b&gt;Vix :&lt;/b&gt;26.97 (+1.63%); [+9.64%]; {-1.97%} \n## Sectors Summary \n_Three highest sectors for today were -_ \n&lt;b&gt;Utilities: &lt;/b&gt;(+1.07%); &lt;b&gt;Health Care: &lt;/b&gt;(+0.99%); &lt;b&gt;Industrials: &lt;/b&gt;(+0.73%) \\\n_Three lowest sectors for today were -_\n &lt;b&gt;Energy: &lt;/b&gt;(-2.27%); &lt;b&gt;Consumer Discretionary: &lt;/b&gt;(-0.91%); &lt;b&gt;Real Estate: &lt;/b&gt;(-0.36%) \n## Commodities/Futures \n(1-day %), [5-day %], {10-day %} \\\n_**Currency -**_ \\\n&lt;b&gt;USD Index :&lt;/b&gt;93.864 (-0.17%); [+0.65%]; {-0.04%}\\\n &lt;b&gt;BC :&lt;/b&gt;11595 (-2.16%); [-2.45%]; {+6.73%} \\\n_**Precious Metals -**_\\\n&lt;b&gt;Gold :&lt;/b&gt;1908.9 (-0.32%); [-1.03%]; {+0.08%}  &lt;b&gt;Silver :&lt;/b&gt;24.224 (+0.11%); [-3.88%]; {+1.59%}\\\n _**Farming -**_ \\\n&lt;b&gt;Soybeans :&lt;/b&gt;1062.25 (-1.08%); [+1.64%]; {+0.65%}  \n&lt;b&gt;Corn :&lt;/b&gt;403.75 (-0.31%); [+3.47%]; {+4.55%} \\\n&lt;b&gt;Coffee :&lt;/b&gt;109.5 (-2.37%); [-2.06%]; {-0.7%} \\\n_**Industrials -**_ \\\n&lt;b&gt;Crude :&lt;/b&gt;40.96 (-0.46%); [+3.4%]; {+0.25%} \\\n&lt;b&gt;Nat Gas :&lt;/b&gt;2.775 (-2.52%); [-6.11%]; {+7.34%} \\\n&lt;b&gt;Copper :&lt;/b&gt;3.0855 (-0.96%); [-0.16%]; {+3.05%} \n## Dark Pool Summary - \nHighest Dark Pool buys by rank -\\\n            1.

        "selftext": "I played COSTCO call options since May and made about $200k. COSTCO is a stock with low intrinsic value options and rewards you well if you are patient. This is not a swing trade or a 10 bagger but in my opinion, it was always a sure thing, hence I was able to buy 100 or 200 call options. I've played other tech options, NVDA, AMD, AMZN, TSLA but it always felt like pure gambling. I made about 40k on NVDA but got burned for 20k on TSLA and AMZN. I don't recommend playing options on tech stocks unless you're YOLOing stimulus money or a paycheck.\n\nOption trading on WSB has become exactly that but there are still handful savvy people that are playing smart. Sure, in the beginning when you have less than $10k, you can take higher risk for higher reward. But when you accumulate over 50k or 100k, you can invest on plays like this that gives you 10-15% return consistently without having to risk losing 80%.\n\nMy advice is once you hit 50k, don't chase option plays like ZOOM or obscure meme plays like PRPL.   \nPlay monthly options on lower intrinsic value call options like WMT or TGT. Don't hold for earnings unless you have options that are over 1 month till expiration.\n\nIf you manage to get past 100k, then put 75k in APPL or AMZN or NVDA and you can do whatever you want with the 25k. This has worked for me and hopefully this inspires this community to play smarter and make money.\n\nNow I will go to local Costco and get some rotisserie chicken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fevp23hboiq51.png?width=1053&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcc0b91dfe2ccfcd8c5ee0ea0eefd0ab2d28a254\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kbst9qwgoiq51.png?width=972&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0891a965f84b59a91b7341b519bf5588fbe61c7d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xpj57o7loiq51.png?width=941&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c49437265d557ea40dc8cbc7446a68df76a36c3e\n\nIt wasn't all glory and there were days when my unrealized loss was 30k or 40k but you have to set a price target or an exit date and be discipline. I took this screenshot to remind myself to always be humble and disciplined. I'm still holding some of these and they are now 20k unrealized gain.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3o38stz9piq51.png?width=1173&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6b3da0b4825d1543c15e1c91996bd1e00480107",

        "selftext": "\\#**WHY #AMD #IS #GOING #TO #THE  #MOON**  \n\n\n\\#1\n\n**Heavily Rumoured New CPUs (including 16 core gaming CPU).**\n\nThis would be revolutionary and will put investors into a complete frenzy. The slide was leaked and confirmed by [videocardz.com](https://videocardz.com) which is a very authentic source for tech news. A 16 core CPU that pulls 105w at a reasonable price will be GAME-CHANGING, and everyone will want to get their hands on it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f4y8kvv3blq51.png?width=1569&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0e772c7f4963cb569eb0024dcee84fb63b4697e\n\nAlong with this game-changing chip, 3 additional CPUs are rumored to be released.   \n\n\n\\#2\n\n**Big Navi having possibly better performance**  \nThere have been leaks off Newegg of Big Navi being better than the 3080. Even if the cards are neck in neck AMD will be able to paint the 6000 series cards as better due to minor discrepancies.\n\nRadeon RX 6900 XT\t5,120\t1,500\t16GB GDDR6\t512\t256-bit\t300  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRadeon RX 6800 XT\t3,840\t1,500\t12GB GDDR6\t384\t192-bit\t200  \n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRadeon RX 6700 XT\t2,560\t1,500\t6GB GDDR6\t384\t192-bit\t150  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x0zjsju2clq51.png?width=970&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14551f974837dfc21662c24da268d5284287d169\n\n  \n\\#3\n\n**NVIDIA 3rd Party Card Catastrophe**\n\n*(this section is from my previous post)*\n\nSo most GPUs are made by a 3rd party. AMD and NVIDIA make the actual \"brain\" of the GPU but 3rd party partners add onto it for better performance (very basic explanation). Don't ask me why this is, it is just mainly because of logistical reasons.\n\nBut that is not the point, the point is that the great majority of GPUs are third-party cards meaning that they get to change around the design of the PCB. The issue here is that some of these third-party partners cheaped out on little capacitors.\n\nBy cheapening out it is leading to bad power delivery. The only way to fix this rn is to downclock the card which the normal person doesn't know how to do and doesn't expect is necessary when they are buying a 500$+ piece of hardware.\n\nI feel like if there is a mass callback that will be bad PR. NVIDIA could always release drivers that make the cards run below their listed spec but i'm not sure if people will really want that even if the performance loss is marginal.\n\nEVGA already confirmed the suspicions that these cards were crashing because of capacitor issues. It may be different for other companies but at least for EVGA this is what they are saying currently.\n\n**But why does this matter??**\n\nPeople who were looking to pick up a next-gen GPU right away are now hesitant and will wait for AMDS offerings. The people who did return their GPUs will also possibly wait. Faulty cards will most likely get a down clock which will make Big Navi look better. It supposedly already is better and this 3-5% difference could really change people's minds.  \n\n\n\\#4 \n\nLisa Su is an absolute unit. She will for sure talk about their timeline and plans for 5nm/3nm. I am guessing that this will rally investors to invest because they will see shinny 5nm/3nm while Intel is just getting to 10nm.  \n\n\n**POSITIONS:**  \n\\+95 call  (exp 12/18)  \n\\- 100 call (exp 12/18)\n\n(*call me a pussy for using a debit spread but I think its the best for my case)*  \n\n\nif you have something else you want to share comments below and I will add it!\n\nSources:\n\n[https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-ryzen-9-3950x-to-become-worlds-first-16-core-gaming-cpu](https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-ryzen-9-3950x-to-become-worlds-first-16-core-gaming-cpu)\n\n[https://www.igorslab.de/en/what-real-what-can-be-investigative-within-the-crashes-and-instabilities-of-the-force-rtx-3080-andrtx-3090/](https://www.igorslab.de/en/what-real-what-can-be-investigative-within-the-crashes-and-instabilities-of-the-force-rtx-3080-andrtx-3090/)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6bUUEEe-X8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6bUUEEe-X8)\n\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/evga-nvidia-rtx-3080-capacitor-caused-crashes](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/evga-nvidia-rtx-3080-capacitor-caused-crashes)\n\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/newegg-insider-reportedly-reveals-radeon-rx-6900-xt-rx-6800xt-rx-6700-xt-specifications](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/newegg-insider-reportedly-reveals-radeon-rx-6900-xt-rx-6800xt-rx-6700-xt-specifications)\n\n*This is not financial advice just me presenting the facts and the possibility of a callback.*  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b2ciqo9vdlq51.png?width=662&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64d0fa79a87e74390c112a07e8d93a82c5a8476e",

Would graciously appreciate someone with maybe some more knowledge opinion.\n\nWould love any insight you guys have on these tickers. Thanks again any constructive thoughts are GREATLY appreciated.  \n\n$NEE - Amazing Long term growth. Attempting to buyout other companies. Dividend has been rapidly increasing. Is the growth potentially done or near done?\n\n$AVGO - Amazing long term growth. Dividend has been RAPIDLY increasing. Can't imagine Broadcom getting smaller but just like NEE how much more growth is there still?\n\n$NVDA - INSANE long term growth. Big player in the market. Doubtful they are going anywhere in the future\n Trash dividend. And once again they have grown so much idk how much more they are likely to grow.\n\n$PYPL - Amazing long term growth. PayPal rumored to be moving into Ecommerence. Huge player for electronic transactions. I forsee them continuing to grow into the future.. No dividend \n\n$PENN - Amazing long term growth. Analysis put a $100 PT. I dont see gambling EVER going anywhere in the future. \n\n$COST - Decent long term growth. I feel like Costco is going to continue to grow as a super giant into the future. Dividend is slightly lacking. \n\n$U - New IPO. Unity is a huge player in the mobile app industry. If expect growth with them branching out. Not to mention I dont see mobile app using another company to this degree.\n\n$T - Mainly for the dividend. 10yr growth is a mere 2% on average. I feel like HBO MAX and the casual dividend increase will make up for this long term. \n\n$JPM - Decent long term growth. Bad PR recently but I dont see that holding it back. Dividend is pretty prime and the banking sector will grow once interest rates are settled. \n\n$CRSR - New IPO.HUGE player in the ESports community. Doesn't seem to be slowing down at all. Big on Twitch.tv with sponsorships and the streaming industry. Esport is a rapidly growing industry. Sadly no dividend as of now. \n\n$KIRK - There site is a overstock wayfair look alike. In the future I can see them rapidly growing just as those did. Even to some degree the growth potential would be massive.\n\n$JMIA - Essentially the amazon of Europe/Africa. Branching out into the African market. The growth on this seems like it could be exponential.\n\n$AGO - New IPO. Sells camping gear as well as GUNS and AMMO. Comparing it to camping world [$CWH] seems like there's alot of potential growth in the market.",
