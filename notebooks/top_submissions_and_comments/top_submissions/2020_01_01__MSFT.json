Guardant Health ran from $30 to $112 with blow-out earnings quarter after quarter.\n\nAs the bull market charges into 2020, here are 3 stocks under $20 billion market cap that I'm bullish about. Let me know if you enjoy these types of posts, and I'll come out with more picks in my portfolio!\n\n**Guardant Health (**[**$GH**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GH&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d)**):**\n\n\"Guardant Health, Inc. is a precision oncology company.

Just opened a Roth IRA, looking to get the most bang for my buck for the next 25+ years with this account. \n\nI have two simple strategies I am considering employing. I'm thinking about either investing only in one mutual fund and/or total market ETF and 1-3 individual stocks that would only make up 10-20% of my portfolio(V, MSFT and AAPL most likely). My other strategy would be investing in 10-20 blue chip stocks with with high revenue, low debt and decent dividend payouts (WFC, MO, CCI for example). What strategy is best for very long term growth? \n\nIn regards to the first strategy, if I'm going very long in a Roth IRA wouldnt a mutual fund be better than an ETF? Should I do one or both?\n\nIn regards to the second strategy, since Roth IRA isnt taxed, does it make more sense to go after blue chip dividend stocks or growth stocks?\n\nThanks in advance!",

See $24k YOLO below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **MARKETSHARE CREEP**: As the collective US/EU retail industry looks around and wonders if they should be establishing or growing their competitor's cash cow, they'll be looking to strategically invest elsewhere. There are only a handful of major IaaS providers: Microsoft, Google, IBM. Microsoft has greater IaaS market share than every other remaining hyperspace cloud player combined.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Player|2018 IaaS Market Share / Year Prior +/-|\n|:-|:-|\n|Amazon Web Services $AMZN|47.8% (-1.6)|\n|Microsoft Azure $MSFT|15.5% (+2.8)|\n|Alibaba Cloud $BABA|7.7% (+2.4)|\n|Google Cloud Platform $GOOG|4% (+0.7)|\n|IBM Cloud $IBM|1.8% (-0.1)|\n\nSource:  [https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-07-29-gartner-says-worldwide-iaas-public-cloud-services-market-grew-31point3-percent-in-2018](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-07-29-gartner-says-worldwide-iaas-public-cloud-services-market-grew-31point3-percent-in-2018) \n\nFor the time being, $BABA and $MSFT have culturally different clientele, providing a favorable moat to $MSFT in the US and with allies (UK, EU, AU, NZ) and the Western hemisphere neighborhood (LATAM). Of course, that's before we get to PaaS, which $MSFT serves as a leader in some of the most cutting edge (AI/ML, IoT), and as the uncontested king of on premise and hybrid cloud in enterprises.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **THE MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX HATH SPOKEN:** Unless you're living under a rock, you've probably heard about JEDI and DEOS. The monopoly that $AMZN once enjoyed in the cleared space  is now in the crosshairs of big blue. This opens the door for Microsoft to gain all types of opportunities in the highly profitable federal space, and some of which it is uniquely positioned for with it's Azure Stack Hub and array of edge devices. Microsoft, with it's already deeply established sales and relationships with the DoD, will have no problems capitalizing on this opportunity. It's only just beginning. Microsoft can leverage a huge partner base, and don't forget that US defense companies can increase that leverage too.\n* **O365, DYNAMICS, LINKEDIN, AND GITHUB ARE EASY MONEY:** $MSFT is enjoying the fruits of its acquisition(al) labors on one hand, and the easiest inflows of cash via O365, which will see increased growth as more cleared / defense onboard into O365 and dog-whistle Teams.\n* **ENJOYS THE TAILWINDS OF A RECORD YEAR**: $MSFT and Azure are coming along from record highs, with yearly gains between the 50-60% respectively. If you're bullish on the S&amp;P 500/DOW, you can be bullish on Microsoft - and expect it to outperform. Microsoft has enjoyed steady climbs after most favorable earning events, provided its largely institutional (\\~73%) ownership isn't panicking. \n\n[MSFT 07\\/18 - present day](https://preview.redd.it/3p9ccnoj0ub41.png?width=1196&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=191d019a0e7af40f2cca475e20db6d2bd60cedb4)\n\nMY $23,958.32\u202c YOLO: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uvizq7hj1ub41.png?width=645&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=246b5fccb66ce5191d9e562bc723df21bb892f5e",

Years ago, I was failing big time, in over my head so I brought it to RBC to straighten out.  Some of the stocks I still have from my initial purchases like msft, intc, cn rail, which now I have done great on.  The other day I went to see him and his new team wants to reconfigure my entire profile, basically sell all my stocks and purchase a series of dynamic asset allocation funds.  They are companies similar to Berskshire.  I asked what about my current stocks, are they transferable in kind to these funds.  He said no, they would be sold.  I brought up the fact that between a group of stocks that I own, I counted capital gain of 300k and with a few loser stocks that I lost about 40k.  So I have to pay tax on that now, which would put me in the highest tax bracket.  I could not believe he had no answer for that and did not even think about that.  I am not that smart but even I knew that.  He was proud that last year my portfolio did 15%, which is a mix of stocks, bonds, GIC.  Well on my own side, I did 15 % as well with some basic TD bank mutual funds, VTI and a few good stocks.  A lot of you guys on here are well versed in trading, I know enough to be dangerous and the dangerous part got me in trouble.  Face it, the last 8 years, anyone could have made money.  When I first started in the late 90's, it was like now.  I would buy 5k of stocks, in a few months, it was worth 7k, I would sell and go on vacation. Then the tech crash came  and i lost a ton.

        "selftext": "This time last year, Slack Technologies, the popular workplace chat provider, was one of the most eagerly anticipated public tech debuts of 2019. That seems like a long time ago. Since Slack went public in June, its stock has dropped about 40%.\n\n\nThe reason for the slump: Revenue growth at Slack is slowing and competition is intensifying, especially from Microsoft. The tech giant is relying on a familiar tactic\u2014bundling a Slack killer with a widely used existing product, its Office 365 suite of apps. Given that competitive pressure, I predict 2020 will be the year that\u2014after years of acquisition speculation\u2014a larger tech company will finally buy Slack.\n\n\nPotential suitors could include Amazon\u2014which has reportedly eyed Slack in the past\u2014and Google. Both companies are top providers of cloud computing services and could plug Slack into their cloud units to increase the revenue they generate from online applications. \n\n\nAlready a big Amazon cloud customer, Slack has committed to spending a minimum of $250 million with the Amazon Web Services division between 2018 and 2023, according to regulatory filings. Becoming part of Amazon could help Slack\u2014which is currently unprofitable\u2014trim some costs.    \n\n\nCisco Systems and Salesforce, both of which could use a spark to fire up their collaboration software businesses, might also make sense as acquirers. Both companies have relationships with corporate chief information officers that could open the door to customers in the Fortune 500. \n\n\nA Slack purchase would be a sizable deal. Slack has a market capitalization of just over $12 billion, although its management would likely push for a higher price. One benchmark they might point to: A few weeks before it went public, Slack was valued in private market trades at about $19 billion. At that price, Slack would be the largest acquisition ever for the likes of Amazon, Google, Cisco, and Salesforce.  \n\n\nOne company that likely won\u2019t buy Slack is the company that would arguably be most responsible for its sale: Microsoft. Owning Slack, along with its in-house Slack competitor, Teams, would give Microsoft a dominant position in workplace collaboration software. Microsoft reportedly considered offering an $8 billion bid for Slack in 2016 before deciding to funnel more investment into building out Teams. \n\n\nBut I\u2019m skeptical that Microsoft could pull off such a deal. Gaining regulatory approval would be an ordeal, if not impossible, because Microsoft already offers a directly competitive product. Microsoft went through the antitrust wringer two decades ago and is happy to avoid joining other big tech companies in the regulatory spotlight now. \n\n\nSpokespeople from AWS and Salesforce declined to comment. A Microsoft spokesperson didn\u2019t have a comment. Spokespeople from Cisco and Google didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. \n\n\nIf Slack CEO and co-founder Stewart Butterfield doesn\u2019t want to sell, he will have to find a way to win back investor confidence. Clearly what is worrying Wall Street is Slack\u2019s slowing revenue growth and increasing losses. \n\n\nThe company\u2019s annual sales grew 110% in fiscal 2018, which ended last Jan. 31, from the prior year. In fiscal 2019, that figure fell to 82%. In its most recent earnings report, Slack forecast that revenue growth for fiscal 2020 will fall even further to around 55%. Meanwhile, its net loss rose to about $88 million in the third quarter, from nearly $48 million a year earlier.\n\n\nSlack has spread like wildfire as a business tool largely through a free version of its product. To continue to grow, it must find ways to convince these users to become paying ones. During its recent earnings call, for the quarter ended Oct. 31, the company said it had 105,000 paying customers, up 30% from the same period a year earlier. \n\n\nIn an interview, Daniel Newman, founder and principal analyst at Futurum Research, said Slack\u2019s early growth was partly due to developers\u2019 frustration with the limitations of older products like Microsoft\u2019s Skype and Cisco\u2019s Webex. Now, with Microsoft pouring money into Teams and making improvements to the product to entice large companies, Slack has to work much harder to attract customers, he said. And a host of younger companies, such as Zoom and Asana, and open source startups, including Mattermost and Rocket.Chat, also offer workplace collaboration tools. \n\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of competition in the collaboration space right now,\u201d Newman said. \n\n\nThe growing competition highlights another issue for Slack. Having captured a loyal following of developers and technical users through word of mouth, it is now spending heavily on sales and marketing to show how its software can help companies be more productive. During the third quarter, its sales and marketing expenses jumped 42% to over $96 million. \n\n\nMicrosoft appears to have gotten into Butterfield\u2019s head. This first became apparent in 2016 when Slack took out a full-page ad in The New York Times to \u201cwelcome\u201d Microsoft to the market around the time it introduced Teams. More recently, Butterfield has sounded a defensive note on earnings calls, pointing out that Slack has to earn every customer and can\u2019t rely on bundling its product with other business applications, as Microsoft does. \n\n\nHe often pushes back on Microsoft\u2019s framing of its daily active user numbers for Teams, claiming that the company muddies the waters by counting people who make voice calls using Skype. Slack\u2019s usage figures more accurately reflect the deep level of engagement its users have with the service, according to Butterfield. \u201cThe confusion is deliberately created,\u201d Butterfield said on Slack\u2019s recent fiscal third quarter earnings call with investors. \n\n\nWhatever the reason, Butterfield faces a choice: Keep fighting or surrender by selling.",

The rule has faced a number of courtroom challenges that so far have prevented it from going into effect. Now, a handful of tech companies have signed [an amicus brief filing in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (PDF)](https://assets-wp.boundless.com/uploads/2020/01/Public-charge-amicus-for-Boundless-et-al-CA4-FINAL.pdf), putting their public weight behind rescinding the rule.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThose companies argue that the rule will prevent them from hiring the talent they need. From the filing:\n\n&gt;\u201cAmerican businesses depend upon an efficient immigration system to ensure that they have access to the talent that they need to grow and succeed. Although the American-citizen workforce is highly skilled, businesses sometimes benefit by hiring foreign nationals for certain positions, often sponsoring these workers for permanent residency. Immigration law has long recognized that, in such circumstances, businesses require pathways (such as H-1B and L-1 visas adjusted to 5 employment-based permanent residency) for foreign nationals to come to and remain in the United States to work\u2026 The Rule, however, would restrict American businesses\u2019 ability to hire foreign-born workers, because, under the Rule, many skilled workers who would otherwise have been eligible for permanent residency would now be barred from receiving it.\u201d\n\nIn other words, these companies feel that the rule is too broad: \u201cGiven the numerous and amorphous factors\u2014and the unfettered discretion given to immigration officials\u2014virtually any applicant could be found to have some basis for a denial.\u201d\n\nfrom\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://insights.dice.com/2020/01/21/low-income-immigrants-rule-microsoft-push-back/](https://insights.dice.com/2020/01/21/low-income-immigrants-rule-microsoft-push-back/)",

Regardless of how game 5 plays out, the series was won here.\n\n\nMSFT 150c's and 160c's\nTSLA 6/2020 700c\nAMD 1/2021 30c and couple hundred shares\nAlways holding shares of GOOG\n253 shares of TQQQ\n\nMSFT will be MVP.",

        "selftext": "**Earnings Watch:  Nearly half of index, 14 out of 30 companies, expected to report  holiday-season results in busiest week of the season, which also  includes Facebook, Tesla and Amazon**\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average increased more than 22% in 2019 and  is already up 2.2% through three weeks of 2020, but it is about to face  its biggest test of the young year, and potentially many years.\n\nNearly half of the 30 Dow  [DJIA, -0.58%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/djia?mod=MW_story_quote) components are scheduled to  report results from the holiday season in the coming week, which will be  by far the busiest week of the earnings season.\n\nThere are 14  Dow companies expected to report, the most companies from the blue-chip  index to report in a single week since at least 2014, a group that  includes two trillion-dollar market caps in Apple Inc. [AAPL, -0.29%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/aapl?mod=MW_story_quote) and Microsoft Corp [MSFT, -1.01%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/msft?mod=MW_story_quote) Plenty of non-Dow  companies will throw their numbers in as well \u2014 141 of the S&amp;P 500  companies are expected to report, including Facebook Inc. [FB, -0.83%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fb?mod=MW_story_quote), Amazon.com Inc. [AMZN, -1.22%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amzn?mod=MW_story_quote) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc [AMD, -2.63%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amd?mod=MW_story_quote) \n\nThe 85 members of the S&amp;P 500 that have reported results thus far  have seen net income fall by 0.3% on average from a year ago, though  Credit Suisse Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Jonathan Golub said it\u2019s  tough to make broader inferences from early reports given different  sectors tend to post results at different parts of the earnings cycle.  More than a third of S&amp;P 500 that have reported so far sit in the  financials sector, which could skew those results.\n\nThe  FactSet consensus currently calls for net income to fall by 1.9% for  the S&amp;P 500, based on a blend of reported results and analyst  projections, which would mean [the current earnings recession ](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/earnings-recession-is-expected-to-swallow-all-of-2019-after-holiday-forecasts-disappoint-2019-11-22)would swallow all of 2019\u2019s results.\n\nHere\u2019s what to watch for in the week ahead. \n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-dow-is-about-to-face-its-stiffest-test-in-years-2020-01-25](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-dow-is-about-to-face-its-stiffest-test-in-years-2020-01-25)",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 6th, 2020.\n\n# **Geopolitical tensions could hold back stocks in the week ahead, as investors await jobs report  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/03/geopolitical-tensions-could-hold-back-stocks-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Geopolitical concerns could continue to weigh on stocks in the week ahead, leaving investors wondering whether Middle East tensions will be the catalyst for a much anticipated market pullback.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks sold off Friday, the second trading day of the year, after a rally to new highs on Thursday. The market was slammed after the U.S. killed Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani, sparking a rally in oil prices and raising concerns Iran will take some retaliatory action.\n*****\n&gt; The big event in the coming week is the December employment report, expected to show 160,000 payrolls were added and average earnings rose 3.1% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv. The jobs report is especially important after December\u2019s ISM manufacturing data Friday was surprisingly negative and the weakest in more than a decade.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the four-day week at 3,235, with a loss of 0.2%, after Friday\u2019s 0.7% decline. Treasury yields retreated on Friday, as buyers moved into the safety of bonds and the 10-year yield was at 1.78%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis was a textbook rationale for a bout of profit taking, but that said, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s dramatic,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \u201cNonetheless, the question will be when do buyers come in ... Much will depend on this weekend and next week in terms of headlines from both the White House and Iran.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Some analysts have been looking for a minor selloff in stocks after the fourth quarter\u2019s 8.5% gain in the S&amp;P 500. But whether Friday\u2019s decline is the start of something bigger is unclear.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt could be, but only in retrospect will you know for sure,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group.\n*****\n&gt; Boockvar said if Iran takes some minor action, the market could shrug it off, oil could lose its gains, and stocks could move higher again.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe may see Treasurys continue to get a big bid, gold get a bid and the safe-haven currencies get a bid. If we go into things next week and all things are quiet, the market will pay attention to the data,\u201d Krosby said.\n*****\n&gt; Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities, expects to see Treasury yields lower initially. \u201cI think short-term, the geopolitical risk is probably going to override any fundamental views that people have of the marketplace,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; But there could be a catalyst for some Treasury selling with the issuance of high level of corporate bonds in the coming week. Faranello expects the year to start off strong, with corporate treasurers looking to raise about $30 billion to $35 billion in the debt market.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said they will be looking closely at the jobs data after Friday\u2019s surprisingly weak manufacturing survey from the Institute for Supply Management, which was expected to have been better because of the trade agreement.\n*****\n&gt; Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont, said the survey actually took place before the trade deal was announced, and he\u2019s waiting for the results of the next couple of reports.\n*****\n&gt; He expects to see 165,000 jobs added in December, off of 266,000 in November, which was in part skewed by the end of GM\u2019s strike. \u201cI think there\u2019s a little upside risk. It seems like we saw a pretty strong Christmas season,\u201d he said, adding there could have been more hiring than was factored into seasonal adjustments.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/aoDnUW7.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/6x4NtiW.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/I3ZNEuH.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/QqYTbUD.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/U3Ltxt2.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CyHtJoF.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/RO92K5i.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SEszd5M.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Trp0mo0.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/V19lVTd.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tlPjW9c.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/aicevVU.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical January Trading: Volatile Last 20 Years\n\n&gt; Yesterday major indexes continued their recent trend of strength on the first trading day of 2020. While today the market has turned weaker on escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran. This type of volatility was once quite rare in January. However since 2000, the S&amp;P 500 has declined ten times in twenty years in January. This recent weakness can be seen in the above January seasonal pattern chart.\n\n&gt; Over the last 21 years, Only NASDAQ has posted a full-month average gain. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have started January positive, only to surrender early-month gains by the eighth trading day. Greatest weakness has appeared just after mid-month, the eleventh trading day. Mild average losses on or around the eleventh trading day quickly swell to over 2% for DJIA and nearly as much for S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/82a79e9eb21df6d414fd0ec1c7725b4d/e48bbc4e7f5b7041-e9/s500x750/6a964dc4a15e1c9ab0fcc9ccc451f6e642aacff5.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Banner Year for US Equities\n\n&gt; 2019 was surely a banner year for US equities. With a total return of 31.5%, the S&amp;P 500's gain in 2019 was nearly three times the historical average 12-month return of 11.7%. That's strong! In the chart below we compare the S&amp;P 500's annualized returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years to its average annualized returns over those same time frames since 1928. While the one-year return sticks out like a sore thumb, we would note that the S&amp;P 500's annualized returns over the last two, three, and ten years are also above average. Almost as notable as the fact that the one year return has been so much stronger than average is that the S&amp;P 500's two-year return is less than two percentage points above its historical average. That just shows how bad 2018 was! Looking further out, the only time frame where returns are below average is over the last twenty years where the 6.1% annualized gain is almost five percentage points below the historical average. Over a full twenty years, that's a difference of tripling your investment versus making eight times your investment!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/010220-Annualized-returns.png))**\n\n&gt; The chart below compares how current returns during the above time frames rank on a percentile basis relative to all other periods. The S&amp;P 500's one-year return ranks in the 85th percentile which is pretty extreme. For the two, five, and ten year periods, though, current returns are much more middle of the road. Conversely, as stretched as extreme to the upside that the one-year return is relative to all other periods, the twenty-year return is even more depressed to the downside. At just 4.6, more than 95% of all other 20-year periods have been better than the last 20.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/010220-Annualized-returns-Percentile.png))**\n\n&gt; Finally, as mentioned above the last year has certainly been a strong one, and it follows a year where returns had been abnormally poor. The chart below shows the rolling 12-month total return for the S&amp;P 500 going back to 1990. The gain of 31.49% over the last year was the strongest for the S&amp;P 500 in six years coming up just shy of the 32.39% gain in 2013. Last year at this time, though, the S&amp;P 500 was down over 4% on a total return basis in the prior 12 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/010220-Annualized-returns-Percentile-rolling.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# 2019 and 2020 Dogs of the Dow\n\n&gt; The Dogs of the Dow strategy is a simple, hands-off investment approach that says to buy the 10 highest yielding stocks in the Dow 30 at the start of each year. With the calendar turning over from 2019 to 2020, below is a look at how the Dogs strategy performed in 2019. As shown, the 10 Dogs posted a total return of 19.38% in 2019, which was below the 25% return for the Dow and well below the 28% that the 20 non-Dogs returned. The biggest winner in the Dogs in 2019 was JP Morgan (JPM) with a gain of 47.27%, but Pfizer's (PFE) decline of 6.92% really hurt overall performance.\n\n&gt; The 20 non-Dogs were led by Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Visa (V), and United Tech (UTX), while Walgreens Boots (WBA) and 3M (MMM) were the two non-Dogs that fell in 2019.

Eight of the ten Dogs from 2019 remain on the list, while 3M (MMM) and Walgreens Boots (WBA) -- the two non-Dogs that fell in 2019 -- have replaced JP Morgan (JPM) and Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) -- the two biggest gainers of the Dogs in 2019. Dow Inc. (DOW) is the highest yielding Dog at 5.12%, followed by Exxon (XOM), IBM, and Verizon (VZ), which all have dividend yields above 4%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/2020dogs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Full Year 2019, Q4, and December Asset Class Total Returns\n\n&gt; Below are the final total return performance numbers for key ETFs across asset classes in 2019. For each ETF, we also include its performance in Q4 and December.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 rallied 2.9% in December and 8.99% in Q4 to finish the full year up 31.22%. The Tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) was by far the best performing US index ETF in 2019 with a gain of 38.96%, and it was the third best ETF in the entire matrix. The title of best performing ETF in 2019 goes to the S&amp;P 500 Technology sector ETF (XLK), which rallied 49.86%. Remember, 40% of XLK is made up of just Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), which gained 89% and 58% in 2019, respectively. The Russia stock market ETF (RSX) was the second biggest winner in the matrix with a 2019 total return of 40.79%.\n\n&gt; Everywhere you look across the equity landscape, there were big winners in 2019, but the weakest area of the market was the Energy sector ETF (XLE). Even still, XLE managed to put up double-digit percentage gains on the year at +11.74%.\n\n&gt; In the commodities space, we saw oil gain 32.61% in 2019, which actually bested the gain for the S&amp;P 500. Gold (GLD) and silver (SLV) both put in solid gains in the mid-teens, while the perpetually losing natural gas ETF (UNG) was the only ticker in the matrix that fell across all three time frames (December, Q4, and full year).\n\n&gt; Looking at fixed income, the aggregate bond market ETFs (AGG and BND) posted total returns of 8%+, while the 20+ Year Treasury ETF (TLT) gained 14% on the year. Q4 and December were tough for fixed income, however, as rates moved higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/assetclass1231.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# January Almanac: Average Performance Slips in Presidential Election Years\n\n&gt; January has quite a reputation on Wall Street as an influx of cash from yearend bonuses and annual allocations typically propels stocks higher. January ranks #1 for NASDAQ (since 1971), but fifth on the S&amp;P 500 and sixth for DJIA since 1950. It is the end of the best three-month span and holds a full docket of indicators and seasonalities.\n\n&gt; DJIA and S&amp;P rankings did slip from 2000 to 2016 as both indices suffered losses in ten of those seventeen Januarys with three in a row, 2008, 2009 and 2010 and then again in 2014 to 2016. January 2009 has the dubious honor of being the worst January on record for DJIA (-8.8%) and S&amp;P 500 (-8.6%) since 1901 and 1931 respectively. Last year, January was downright stellar after the worst December since 1931 for DJIA and S&amp;P 500.\n\n&gt; In election years, Januarys have been weaker. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 slip to number #8 while DJIA average performance dips negative.

If a patient\u2019s blood sugar is dangerously low or high, a coach will call to warn them within 60 seconds. Inspired by how big tech companies personalize services and nudge people into certain behaviors, Livongo \u2014 short for living-on-the-go \u2014 started by treating diabetes, before moving on to hypertension, weight loss and mental health.\n\n**Why?**\n\n* Livongo provides a truly disruptive technology and they're targeting a massive TAM (total addressable market). 90% of the $3.5 trillion spent annually on healthcare is dedicated to people with chronic and mental health conditions -- this is only expected to increase.\n* It also just signed its [largest contract ever](https://www.businessinsider.com/livongo-lands-biggest-contract-yet-2019-10) for the US government, allowing it to provide its diabetes solution to 5.3M employees as part of the Federal Employee Health Benefits Platform starting in 2020. Launching at the start of 2020, the tool will be available to 5 million federal employees and their families \u2014 and Livongo is optimistic that the partnership will afford it 45,000 new members and a revenue boost of up to $60 million through 2021. That's a significant lift given that Livongo brought in a total of\u00a0[$68 million](https://e.businessinsider.com/click/18262001.4/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VjLmdvdi9BcmNoaXZlcy9lZGdhci9kYXRhLzE2MzkyMjUvMDAwMTE5MzEyNTE5MTg1MTU5L2Q3MzEyNDlkczEuaHRt/5d233c18f730436f2414784fB050eba75)\u00a0in revenue in 2018, it reported in its S-1 filing.\n* LVGO's clients include 20% of the Fortune 500 (Target, Pepsi, Microsoft, Merck, and Citigroup) and boast a high retention rate of \\~96%. They reported a 121% YoY growth in Q3 2019 and continue to grow exponentially.\n* Announced partnership this week that they were collaborating with Dexcom ($DXCM) on user data dissemination. In a joint press release, the two companies said that users of Livongo's health information platform would be able to sync their data from DexCom's G6 glucose (blood sugar) monitoring system.\n* Livongo\u00a0and health kiosk startup\u00a0Higi\u00a0have teamed up for a new program that will bring a Livongo-branded on-stage program to nearly 500 retail pharmacies. Higi has smart health stations at more than 11,000 chain grocery stores and pharmacies sites around the country. They include major brands like Rite Aid, Walgreens, and Kroger.",

Now hear me out retards before you start throwing your prebuilt HP Pavilion Gaming Desktops at me.  \n  \nYes we all know that AMD blows shintel out of the water in literally every way and the new stuff makes literally every Intel laptop look like a Chinese knockoff of the 1986 IBM PC Convertible. But look at the news and see who it really affects. Do you think $BECKY is going to buy a 64 core AMD Thundercock? Fuck no, $BECKY knows your eyes can only see 32 cores at a time. And you can be sure her favorite movie studios won't be either because we know in Frozen 3: Iced Caramel Macchiato, that new scene with Elsa doing coke off of Olaf's ass is going to be rendered with 4 year old workstations. Emperor Mickey Mouse is not going to fork out a fucking penny for that shit for several more years because he wants to max out those gains.  \n  \nNow let's get to the more important thing, laptops. Who are the primary audience for new laptop purchases? It's fucking $BECKY. We all know that you're not trading in your 3 year old AMD Ryzen Lenovo for another 10 years when you run out of Indian sweatshops capable of recovering your 1TB hentai collection because they cant find flex tape strong enough to hold your broken down cum stained piece of shit laptop together. Do you think $BECKY cares that AMD's new processors are 5 quadrillion times better than anything that ever made Bob Swan edge in his sleep? Hell fucking no. $BECKY needs her apps and all her friends hate when Shaun sends a green SMS from his lenovo anyway. She can't live without Pages and Keynote, and knows exactly how to turn on Microsoft remote desktop to get help when she can't find a tab she closed on Safari. And you know the fucking second she gets a dent in the cover or spills 1ml of her Matcha Green Tea on the keyboard of her 2019 MacBook Pro and it makes a little sticky noise, she's taking that bitch in to the Apple Store where they convince her to buy a brand new one in full. She will be in tears as she pulls out your Surge Mastercard and buys that 2020 Macbook Air along with the $420.69 Airpods pro deluxe that comes in a box with that cute emoji sticker.  \n  \nDon't say I didn't fucking warn you. $BECKY is coming, but you won't be.",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 6th, 2020.\n\n# **Geopolitical tensions could hold back stocks in the week ahead, as investors await jobs report  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/03/geopolitical-tensions-could-hold-back-stocks-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Geopolitical concerns could continue to weigh on stocks in the week ahead, leaving investors wondering whether Middle East tensions will be the catalyst for a much anticipated market pullback.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks sold off Friday, the second trading day of the year, after a rally to new highs on Thursday. The market was slammed after the U.S. killed Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani, sparking a rally in oil prices and raising concerns Iran will take some retaliatory action.\n*****\n&gt; The big event in the coming week is the December employment report, expected to show 160,000 payrolls were added and average earnings rose 3.1% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv. The jobs report is especially important after December\u2019s ISM manufacturing data Friday was surprisingly negative and the weakest in more than a decade.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the four-day week at 3,235, with a loss of 0.2%, after Friday\u2019s 0.7% decline. Treasury yields retreated on Friday, as buyers moved into the safety of bonds and the 10-year yield was at 1.78%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis was a textbook rationale for a bout of profit taking, but that said, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s dramatic,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \u201cNonetheless, the question will be when do buyers come in ... Much will depend on this weekend and next week in terms of headlines from both the White House and Iran.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Some analysts have been looking for a minor selloff in stocks after the fourth quarter\u2019s 8.5% gain in the S&amp;P 500. But whether Friday\u2019s decline is the start of something bigger is unclear.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt could be, but only in retrospect will you know for sure,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group.\n*****\n&gt; Boockvar said if Iran takes some minor action, the market could shrug it off, oil could lose its gains, and stocks could move higher again.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe may see Treasurys continue to get a big bid, gold get a bid and the safe-haven currencies get a bid. If we go into things next week and all things are quiet, the market will pay attention to the data,\u201d Krosby said.\n*****\n&gt; Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities, expects to see Treasury yields lower initially. \u201cI think short-term, the geopolitical risk is probably going to override any fundamental views that people have of the marketplace,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; But there could be a catalyst for some Treasury selling with the issuance of high level of corporate bonds in the coming week. Faranello expects the year to start off strong, with corporate treasurers looking to raise about $30 billion to $35 billion in the debt market.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said they will be looking closely at the jobs data after Friday\u2019s surprisingly weak manufacturing survey from the Institute for Supply Management, which was expected to have been better because of the trade agreement.\n*****\n&gt; Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont, said the survey actually took place before the trade deal was announced, and he\u2019s waiting for the results of the next couple of reports.\n*****\n&gt; He expects to see 165,000 jobs added in December, off of 266,000 in November, which was in part skewed by the end of GM\u2019s strike. \u201cI think there\u2019s a little upside risk. It seems like we saw a pretty strong Christmas season,\u201d he said, adding there could have been more hiring than was factored into seasonal adjustments.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/aoDnUW7.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/6x4NtiW.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/I3ZNEuH.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/QqYTbUD.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/U3Ltxt2.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CyHtJoF.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/RO92K5i.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SEszd5M.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Trp0mo0.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/V19lVTd.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tlPjW9c.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/aicevVU.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical January Trading: Volatile Last 20 Years\n\n&gt; Yesterday major indexes continued their recent trend of strength on the first trading day of 2020. While today the market has turned weaker on escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran. This type of volatility was once quite rare in January. However since 2000, the S&amp;P 500 has declined ten times in twenty years in January. This recent weakness can be seen in the above January seasonal pattern chart.\n\n&gt; Over the last 21 years, Only NASDAQ has posted a full-month average gain. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have started January positive, only to surrender early-month gains by the eighth trading day. Greatest weakness has appeared just after mid-month, the eleventh trading day. Mild average losses on or around the eleventh trading day quickly swell to over 2% for DJIA and nearly as much for S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/82a79e9eb21df6d414fd0ec1c7725b4d/e48bbc4e7f5b7041-e9/s500x750/6a964dc4a15e1c9ab0fcc9ccc451f6e642aacff5.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Banner Year for US Equities\n\n&gt; 2019 was surely a banner year for US equities. With a total return of 31.5%, the S&amp;P 500's gain in 2019 was nearly three times the historical average 12-month return of 11.7%. That's strong! In the chart below we compare the S&amp;P 500's annualized returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years to its average annualized returns over those same time frames since 1928. While the one-year return sticks out like a sore thumb, we would note that the S&amp;P 500's annualized returns over the last two, three, and ten years are also above average. Almost as notable as the fact that the one year return has been so much stronger than average is that the S&amp;P 500's two-year return is less than two percentage points above its historical average. That just shows how bad 2018 was! Looking further out, the only time frame where returns are below average is over the last twenty years where the 6.1% annualized gain is almost five percentage points below the historical average. Over a full twenty years, that's a difference of tripling your investment versus making eight times your investment!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/010220-Annualized-returns.png))**\n\n&gt; The chart below compares how current returns during the above time frames rank on a percentile basis relative to all other periods. The S&amp;P 500's one-year return ranks in the 85th percentile which is pretty extreme. For the two, five, and ten year periods, though, current returns are much more middle of the road. Conversely, as stretched as extreme to the upside that the one-year return is relative to all other periods, the twenty-year return is even more depressed to the downside. At just 4.6, more than 95% of all other 20-year periods have been better than the last 20.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/010220-Annualized-returns-Percentile.png))**\n\n&gt; Finally, as mentioned above the last year has certainly been a strong one, and it follows a year where returns had been abnormally poor. The chart below shows the rolling 12-month total return for the S&amp;P 500 going back to 1990. The gain of 31.49% over the last year was the strongest for the S&amp;P 500 in six years coming up just shy of the 32.39% gain in 2013. Last year at this time, though, the S&amp;P 500 was down over 4% on a total return basis in the prior 12 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/010220-Annualized-returns-Percentile-rolling.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# 2019 and 2020 Dogs of the Dow\n\n&gt; The Dogs of the Dow strategy is a simple, hands-off investment approach that says to buy the 10 highest yielding stocks in the Dow 30 at the start of each year. With the calendar turning over from 2019 to 2020, below is a look at how the Dogs strategy performed in 2019. As shown, the 10 Dogs posted a total return of 19.38% in 2019, which was below the 25% return for the Dow and well below the 28% that the 20 non-Dogs returned. The biggest winner in the Dogs in 2019 was JP Morgan (JPM) with a gain of 47.27%, but Pfizer's (PFE) decline of 6.92% really hurt overall performance.\n\n&gt; The 20 non-Dogs were led by Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Visa (V), and United Tech (UTX), while Walgreens Boots (WBA) and 3M (MMM) were the two non-Dogs that fell in 2019.

Eight of the ten Dogs from 2019 remain on the list, while 3M (MMM) and Walgreens Boots (WBA) -- the two non-Dogs that fell in 2019 -- have replaced JP Morgan (JPM) and Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) -- the two biggest gainers of the Dogs in 2019. Dow Inc. (DOW) is the highest yielding Dog at 5.12%, followed by Exxon (XOM), IBM, and Verizon (VZ), which all have dividend yields above 4%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/2020dogs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Full Year 2019, Q4, and December Asset Class Total Returns\n\n&gt; Below are the final total return performance numbers for key ETFs across asset classes in 2019. For each ETF, we also include its performance in Q4 and December.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 rallied 2.9% in December and 8.99% in Q4 to finish the full year up 31.22%. The Tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) was by far the best performing US index ETF in 2019 with a gain of 38.96%, and it was the third best ETF in the entire matrix. The title of best performing ETF in 2019 goes to the S&amp;P 500 Technology sector ETF (XLK), which rallied 49.86%. Remember, 40% of XLK is made up of just Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), which gained 89% and 58% in 2019, respectively. The Russia stock market ETF (RSX) was the second biggest winner in the matrix with a 2019 total return of 40.79%.\n\n&gt; Everywhere you look across the equity landscape, there were big winners in 2019, but the weakest area of the market was the Energy sector ETF (XLE). Even still, XLE managed to put up double-digit percentage gains on the year at +11.74%.\n\n&gt; In the commodities space, we saw oil gain 32.61% in 2019, which actually bested the gain for the S&amp;P 500. Gold (GLD) and silver (SLV) both put in solid gains in the mid-teens, while the perpetually losing natural gas ETF (UNG) was the only ticker in the matrix that fell across all three time frames (December, Q4, and full year).\n\n&gt; Looking at fixed income, the aggregate bond market ETFs (AGG and BND) posted total returns of 8%+, while the 20+ Year Treasury ETF (TLT) gained 14% on the year. Q4 and December were tough for fixed income, however, as rates moved higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/assetclass1231.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# January Almanac: Average Performance Slips in Presidential Election Years\n\n&gt; January has quite a reputation on Wall Street as an influx of cash from yearend bonuses and annual allocations typically propels stocks higher. January ranks #1 for NASDAQ (since 1971), but fifth on the S&amp;P 500 and sixth for DJIA since 1950. It is the end of the best three-month span and holds a full docket of indicators and seasonalities.\n\n&gt; DJIA and S&amp;P rankings did slip from 2000 to 2016 as both indices suffered losses in ten of those seventeen Januarys with three in a row, 2008, 2009 and 2010 and then again in 2014 to 2016. January 2009 has the dubious honor of being the worst January on record for DJIA (-8.8%) and S&amp;P 500 (-8.6%) since 1901 and 1931 respectively. Last year, January was downright stellar after the worst December since 1931 for DJIA and S&amp;P 500.\n\n&gt; In election years, Januarys have been weaker. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 slip to number #8 while DJIA average performance dips negative. NASDAQ slips to #3, but average performance remains respectable at 1.7%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/891a38b2171ab08b547127db29f12536/f4d2c822df56176c-4f/s400x600/8f8fe64b2da5c123c7e073095dd8b656e1066429.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 3rd, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.5.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$CMC** \n&gt; * **$WBA** \n&gt; * **$BBBY** \n&gt; * **$STZ** \n&gt; * **$LEN** \n&gt; * **$CALM** \n&gt; * **$SMPL** \n&gt; * **$RPM** \n&gt; * **$ANGO** \n&gt; * **$AZZ** \n&gt; * **$KBH** \n&gt; * **$UNF** \n&gt; * **$MSM** \n&gt; * **$INFY** \n&gt; * **$SCHN** \n&gt; * **$SNX** \n&gt; * **$AYI** \n&gt; * **$GBX** \n&gt; * **$HELE** \n&gt; * **$SAR** \n&gt; * **$EXFO** \n&gt; * **$NTIC** \n&gt; * **$LNN** \n&gt; * **$WDFC** \n&gt; * **$KRUS** \n&gt; * **$FC** \n&gt; * **$SLP**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Trp0mo0.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/lNG07hG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/Y1KO0R4.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.6.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DNOQOhD.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.6.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.7.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QorVd8K.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.7.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/xTrYEcQ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.8.2 0Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/TRPytQz.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/owUNbSh.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.9.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RXUjAgC.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/m5AQPKl.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.10.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/v60Cw2n.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.10.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# lululemon athletica inc. $229.38\n&gt; **lululemon athletica inc.

        "selftext": "\nIt might be a crowded trade, but the stock is still cheap, relative to the online retailer\u2019s free cash flow.\n\n\u201cBuy Amazon\u201d isn\u2019t the world\u2019s biggest stock-picking clich\u00e9, but it\u2019s close. There are 49 analysts who cover the shares, and 47 of them are positive, with two neutral, according to FactSet. Only Alibaba Group Holding of China and ICICI Bank of India boast more endorsements.\n\nAnd after a record-setting run-up, Amazon\u2019s stock isn\u2019t obviously inviting. A $1,000 stake at the close of the stock\u2019s first day of trading in 1997 has turned into more than $950,000. The shares today, at $1,875, go for 69 times projected 2020 earnings.\n\nStill, buy Amazon.com (ticker: AMZN). The stock price looks sensible when compared with free cash flow, which is swelling quickly. Some growth initiatives are only now paying off. Don\u2019t expect a 35% gain this year, as Amazon has averaged, compounded, since going public. But don\u2019t rule it out, either.\n\nAmazon\u2019s reputation for operating near break-even has long been outdated. Founder Jeff Bezos has emphasized free cash flow over accounting earnings from the start, and Amazon has generated free cash since 2002. The company has tended to invest much of that cash for growth, and the result is that earnings have been positive only since 2014, and only meaningfully so since 2018. Now the numbers are reaching escape velocity.\n\nWhen 2019\u2019s results are released, Wall Street expects Amazon to report that revenue increased by 20%, to $279.1 billion; that earnings rose slightly, to $10.4 billion; and that free cash flow ballooned by 28%, to $24.9 billion. In 2020, free cash flow is expected to expand even faster, by 36%, to $34 billion.\n\nWithin five years, the consensus view is that Amazon will become the biggest free cash generator in America, passing some companies that aren\u2019t exactly standing still, like Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT). The simplest reason is that Amazon\u2019s investment spending can\u2019t keep up with its growth rate forever.\n\nAmazon launched Prime in 2005, with its free two-day shipping for members, and vast opportunities for the company to put capital to work building speedier infrastructure. Not long after, Amazon Web Services went into cloud computing, another path for investment. Both ventures have proved to be lucrative, with Prime spurring increased spending by shoppers, and AWS yielding generous profit margins.\n\nLast year, Amazon said that it would spend to shorten free Prime shipping to a single day. There are early signs of that paying off, too. Cowen analyst John Blackledge estimates that Prime membership grew 13% during the fourth quarter, versus a year earlier. That compares with 3% growth a year ago and would be the third straight quarter of acceleration.\n\nNow, consider another of Amazon\u2019s growth initiatives: advertising. A recent search for \u201cmen\u2019s tennis rackets\u201d on Amazon.com yielded editorial recommendations and a racket listing labeled \u201cAmazon\u2019s Choice.\u201d But nothing was more prominently displayed than the three sponsored racket listings near the top\u2014except for the paid ad for portable nets just above them.\n\nAdvertising doesn\u2019t require vast investments in fleets and data farms, and it looks like another boon for Amazon\u2019s growth. Ad revenue will rise 36%, to $17.6 billion, in 2020, and by 2025 will top $46 billion, predicts Cowen\u2019s Blackledge. Assuming a 35% operating margin for the business, he estimates that advertising and AWS will together account for 90% of operating income this year.\n\nThat has important implications for shareholders. First, it bodes well for the competitiveness of a store when it doesn\u2019t have to rely on its retail margins for the bulk of profits. Second, the advertising ramp provides another rich source of funds to invest in growth. Third, with Amazon passing the anniversary of its spending boost for Prime one-day, it is unclear that it will need that extra spending. As things stand, growth in capital expenditures is expected to decelerate from over 25% last year, to 16% this year, to under 10% in 2021.\n\nAmong 10 analysts who have estimated Amazon\u2019s free cash flow out to 2021, the lowest says $32.7 billion, the highest says $57.5 billion, and the average is $43.7 billion. Out to 2024, there are only three estimates, averaging $82.8 billion. Apple, in comparison, is expected to produce close to $63 billion in free cash during its current fiscal year through September.\n\nIf distant estimates for Amazon are feasible, or even if they are only moderately overblown, the stock could continue outperforming. At less than 30 times estimated 2020 free cash flow, it is cheaper than the shares of Visa (V), Nike (NKE), or McDonald\u2019s (MCD). From here, 20% annual gains for the next three years could leave the stock priced at a humbler 25 times free cash flow.\n\nA government crackdown against powerful tech titans is a risk, but Amazon may have a better \u201cwho me?\u201d defense than some of the others. Its market share in the public cloud is less than half, and falling, as Microsoft and others catch up. In e-commerce, more than half of its sales are from third-party merchants who pay to use its services. And in online advertising, it\u2019s a pipsqueak next to Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB).\n\nAll told, Amazon is popular with stockpickers for good reason. It\u2019s not too late to join the crowd.\n\nSource: Barron's",

        "selftext": "On the [Pivot](https://podcasts.apple.com/br/podcast/pivot-with-kara-swisher-and-scott-galloway/id1073226719?l=en) podcast last week, Kara Swisher said that a several people are running the numbers on Twitter. The thesis is pretty simple. Twitter has a massive audience but hasn't turned it into $$$, so someone else could buy it, and make a better go of it.\n\n[Comscore](https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Rankings?country=US) data shows Twitter getting approximately half the audience of Google or Facebook. [Alexa](https://www.alexa.com/topsites) shows the same. So: comparing the stats:\n\n||Market Cap|US users (Comscore)|Revenue: last 12 months|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Twitter|$25bn|156m|$3.4bn|\n|Google|$986bn|257m|$155bn|\n|Facebook|$622bn|219m|$67bn|\n|Snap|$24bn|111m|$1.5bn|\n\nIf it does get acquired, no doubt the buyer will be obvious with hindsight. So to jump the gun, let's consider who's big enough to pay a 30% premium and not trash their own valuation or debt levels. \n\nHere's my short list, and I've included Snap, to show it is unlikely but still possible:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n||Market Cap|Profit|PE ratio|Cash/Debt|EV/Net Debt|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Apple|$1,360bn|$56bn|24x|$8bn cash|n/a|\n|Microsoft|$1,231bn|$41bn|31x|$59bn cash|n/a|\n|Amazon|$936bn|$10bn|92x|$4bn cash|n/a|\n|AT&amp;T|$279bn|$25bn|11x|$159bn debt|2.6x|\n|Disney|$260bn|$10bn|27x|$42bn debt|2.6x|\n|Verizon|$245bn|$20bn|13x|$107bn debt|2.2x|\n|Comcast|$205bn|$14bn|15x|$103bn debt|3.1x|\n|Netflix|$146bn|$2bn|100x|$8bn debt|0.7x|\n|Charter Comm.|$109bn|$2bn|75x|$74bn debt|4.6x|\n|Softbank|$93bn|$9bn|12x|$125bn debt|4.8x|\n|Sony|$91bn|$5bn|19x|$12bn cash|n/a|\n|Snap :)|$24bn|\\-ve|n/a|$1bn cash|n/a|\n\nA $30% premium would value Twitter at $32bn. Assuming an all cash deal, financed by debt at 5% this would cost $1.5bn a year. Compared to Twitter's net income of $1bn, it would almost be cash-break even.\n\nIn the case of cash positive companies like **Apple** and **Microsoft** it might even be accretive, as their cash piles are unlikely to be generating much income. For others with cash, **Amazon** and **Sony**, it's hard to see it having much of an impact to the PE ratio.\n\nFor the debt heavy firms, it would probably be too much for **Charter** and **Softbank** who are already nearing 5x leverage. **AT&amp;T, Verizon** and **Disney** could do a deal without much damage to their balance sheets or impact to their PE ratio. **Comcast** is somewhere in-between.\n\nWhich leaves the two most interesting options:\n\n* **Netflix** would see its net debt ramps to $40bn and it's leverage ratio get to 3.5x. Uncomfortable but manageable. Given the strategy, and the high price of their stock at 100x, it would probably make sense to part pay in shares.\n* **Snap** just doesn't have the access to $32bn of debt. Even if the purchase was self-financing, using Twitter's cashflow, it's hard to see what lenders would underwrite such a deal. So, again, part equity would be a key way to get this deal across the line. But that's unlikely to be enough. I'd guess a PE firm would need to pony up a $5-10bn part of the equity. And yes, bankers are imaginative folks, and PE folks are awash with cash.\n\nLove to hear everyone's views. \n\nThanks in advance.",

        "selftext": "I bought mostly into the VFIAX with some Microsoft and Boeing at the start a year ago (just stocks account no options or leverage).  VFIAX was the biggest but throughout the year I added a few thousand into Microsoft and Boeing.  I feel I lost out on a lot of gains because I did not exit Boeing at all during their peak nor once news broke of the second crash.  I set my Boeing, Microsoft, and VFIAX to reinvest the dividends and was able to get a few more % gains from diversifying out of Boeing into Amazon and Shopfiy a few months post 2nd airplane crash.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot sure how to feel, from the tweet and what I saw personally from other people my gains are no where near what people were making just from stock this year.  Was considering perhaps I failed because I held Boeing and did not diversify into Amazon, Shopify, or AMD before when I had the chance too.  I also let my ignorance convince me to not consider Apple since I felt Microsoft was the better stock pick.  I think for most of the year the VFIAX was just dead weight compared to how individual big market stocks like Apple and Microsoft performed and maybe I should of not held so much of that index.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould appreciate some feedback or some discussion on what you guys played this year and how you did.",

        "selftext": "I'm currently going on a year at my first steady job, and have built up nearly $8000 in emergency fund savings. I just paid off my car, which frees up $500 a month, and I want to start making money with my extra money. I rarely spend more than $1500 a month, so even if I had a sudden $5000 emergency, I could throw that all on a credit card and have a month and a half to pay it back while I get the money back from wherever I invested it.\n\nAfter trying out this last year just by buying a couple of stocks and seeing the return, I'm thinking about investing via Robinhood. The idea would be that I take most of my savings, transfer it into Robinhood, and invest it all in 2-3 stocks. I'd want to pick ones that are well-known, that have a history of \\~40% per year, and which I'm personally invested in and think will do well. I'm a gamer so I think Sony and Microsoft are going to do well with their console releases this holiday. Then, I'd start putting the $1000 a month that was going towards my car and savings and buy more stock every month with it.\n\nThe endgoal here is to make my money grow as fast as possible over a 10-year period, and keep it in a place that's flexible enough for me to grab some if I really need it, plus allows me to manage it but not micro-manage it. I already have regular Roth 401k contributions to get the maximum match (although let me know if you think I should be doing more than that). I recognize the inherent risk in the stock market but I want to take the risk of a 200% growth over 5 years instead of just playing it safe and getting much less.\n\nHow good / terrible is this plan? Are there better things I should do? What am I naive about?",

As a relatively inexperienced investor, it has always felt like growth funds were the way to go and that it was a waste to put money into value funds. That article shows that value funds performed noticeably better than growth funds over that period. As I said, the article is about 5 years old, so I suspect the results would slightly favor growth funds if rewritten today. Ironically, the article states that perhaps you should tilt toward value funds, which would be poor advice for the last five years!\n\nSome takeaways from someone who is still learning a lot:\n\n1. While growth funds may seem like the way to go now, value funds frequently outperform growth funds. So unsurprisingly, it's a good idea to have a blend that captures the overall performance of the market.\n2. The volatility (fluctuations in price) are dramatically greater for growth funds, so you probably need to be a bit more comfortable with big changes to focus on growth funds.\n3. The volatility of mid-cap and small-cap funds tends to be higher than their large-cap counterparts.\n4. Mid-cap and small-cap funds often outperform their large-cap counterparts. (This is surprising to me because we talk so much about companies like Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, etc.) However, large-caps seem to have dominated overall the past 5 years or so.\n\nI'm sure this is all pretty basic stuff for the experienced investor, but it was refreshing for me as a novice to see some real data confirming the statements that are frequently made in r/investing.",

(Yes, you read that right\u2014the 5G dream is barely realized and talk has already started on 6G.)\n\nTo be sure, there are headwinds for some of this tech exuberance.\n\nBig tech has come under the scrutiny of lawmakers due to antitrust concerns and fears over how users\u2019 data is used. Politicians are expected to ramp up their attacks during the 2020 election cycle, but Baird analysts dismiss that as \u201cposturing.\u201d The real risk to tech players won\u2019t be forced breakups but management distraction and inaction spurred by the noise. A slowdown in innovation and M&amp;A is possible, they say.\n\nAs for what will drive growth for Amazon and other tech companies, Baird sees several opportunities over the coming decade:\n\n\u2022 Networking speeds will increase, boosting efficiencies. Some of the largest platform companies may begin building their own chips and processors.\n\n\u2022 There will be new user interfaces as the capabilities of augmented and virtual reality increase, potentially leading to new ways to access e-commerce and online media.\n\n\u2022 Media subscription models will continue to dominate, but there may not be much room for many more players in the space.\n\n\u2022 \u201cConnected everything,\u201d which means our cars and homes may be an extension of today\u2019s connected devices.\n\n\u2022 Cloud wars will continue, providing a huge opportunity for Amazon, Alphabet\u2019s Google, Alibaba, and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\n\u2022 E-commerce will be everywhere, and digital-payment options will increase.\n\nSource: Barron's",

        "selftext": "I think making companies match, to an extent, the money that they return to shareholders in bonuses to their workers would be a good way to help raise the quality of their workers lives significantly without negatively affecting the company itself since it would be money they were going to spend anyway.\n\nThis would effectively halve the dividends and buyback return portion of stock appreciation. However, this wouldn't notably affect company stock prices other than those who rely on their dividend to prop up their stock price.\n\nAs an example, Microsoft returns $14.55 Billion to its shareholders in dividends. If it halves its dividend and matches that return to its employees, each of its 148,000 employees would receive an extra $49,000. From this example, you can see you wouldn't need to do something as drastic as half. Even just a 10% return to employees would result in an extra $9,800 each year.",

People will get hyped about the free 40% without understanding whats going on.\n\n Let me break it down for you. \n\nBuy Nlok now 26.45 cents\n\nOwn Nlok Through January 23rd through Feb 3rd (you have to own past Jan 31st to get dividend you won't be able to sell till Feb. 3rd cause weekend).\n\nYou will receive 12 dollars per share congrats.\n\nSo what's the catch? \n\nThe stock is now worth 14.45, you were given your money back. Put's and calls will be adjusted accordingly it's a 0 sum game.\n\nSo how do you make money? Well I'm not smart enough to tell you that, but its probably going to get a lot of headlines and alot of people buying running the price up because they don't understand. There will also probably be a sell off after the dividend.\n\nI'd say the best time to get into this stock is after the selloff for the long term hold potential of the company. \n\nrecommended reading [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NLOK/community?p=NLOK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NLOK/community?p=NLOK)",
