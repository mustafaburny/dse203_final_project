        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, October 5, 2020**\n\nStocks rose Monday, mostly recovering Friday\u2019s losses, as market participants continue to closely monitor developments around the health of President Trump and additional fiscal stimulus. \n\nLast Friday, Pres. Trump announced that he and the First Lady had contracted COVID-19 and that he was going to Walter Reed Military Medical Center to receive treatment. White House physician Dr. Sean Conley, said Sunday that the President was being treated with steroid dexamethasone (which is typically used in severe cases), remedesivir (broad-spectrum antiviral medication developed by Gilead (GILD)), and  REGN-COV2 (which is used to alleviate symptoms and reduce viral load developed by Regeneron (REGN)). Since then developments around the President\u2019s health have been mostly positive. About an hour or two before market close, Pres. Trump tweeted that he planned to leave the hospital today at 6:30 p.m. ET. \n\nMarket participants also continue to closely eye updates around the election in light of Pres. Trump\u2019s diagnosis and his inability to continue campaigning in the last few weeks before the election on Nov. 3. A new poll released Sunday by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal conducted after last week\u2019s presidential debate, but before news emerged that Trump had tested positive for Covid-19, found that former Vice President Joe Biden was leading Trump 53% to 39% nationally among registered voters in the survey.\n\nHouse Speaker Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin have committed to keep working together to try and come to an agreement regarding additional fiscal stimulus after last week\u2019s failed meeting. Today, Pelosi and Mnuchin met once again, for about an hour, but were again unable to come to a consensus. The pair expects to talk again Tuesday as the White House and Democratic leaders try to craft an elusive second pandemic relief package, Pelosi\u2019s spokesman Drew Hammill said in a tweet. While Mnuchin and Pelosi are pushing to come to an agreement, there are still a range of outstanding disagreements between Democrats, Republicans, and White House officials.\n\nEconomists and FOMC officials are once again pushing for the passage of additional stimulus. With millions of Americans out of work and small businesses struggling to stay afloat, economists are worried that a lack of additional fiscal stimulus would completely stunt the already slowing US economy. Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors said, \u201cEconomic scarring is likely to become more apparent in Q4 as more companies finally start to throw in the towel, reporting closures and job cuts.
