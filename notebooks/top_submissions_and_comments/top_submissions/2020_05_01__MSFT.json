Asked my teacher \u201cwho owns the internet?\u201d He said \u201cno one, but AOL and Microsoft seem to be the most involved. My parents had put away some bonds for me, so I used that money to buy 100 shares of both companies (I believe they were $10 or under). \n\nMade about $60,000. Sold stock and bought a house a block from the beach in Southern California for $500,000 in 2000. Sold that two years later for $600,000. Everyone celebrate.\n\nGot married, continued to buy houses and make money. Got divorced in 2006, lost about 50% of equity in the crash. \n\nThat first beach house is now worth $2+ million. And I don\u2019t even want to do the math on profit if I had kept the stocks. \n\nMoral: keep stocks and real estate for 25 years and spend all extra money on marriage therapy!",

UBER would enter and dominate \u201cfood delivery, freight, autonomous vehicles, and even buses and bikes\u201d. Later, he added flying cars. By 2023, Khosrowshahi continued, UBER could run the entire transportation network for a city! As recently as UBER's latest 10-K, filed in February, UBER characterized its Freight business as \"revolutionizing\" the freight industry. And now they are simply going to shut it down? None of these promises have ever happened, of course, and with this week's forced retrenchment, likely never will.\n\nSevere and unsustainable cash losses have forced UBER to ratchet back its strategic ambitions; to raise another $1.0BN of junk bonds at a steep 7.5%, and reduce on-the-books headcount by at least 25%. UBER will likely cut its \"non-core\" businesses, including freight, autonomous vehicles, flying cars, artificial intelligence, and job matching. These businesses, together, were the secret sauce that was to turn a simple and old-fashioned taxi-hailing app into the next big thing, rivaling Amazon in the scope and reach of its operations. These promises were what drew investors as big as Texas Pacific Group and Softbank in at valuations north of $70BN and even promised to approach $100BN - for a business that, in the here and now, is only able to generate revenues of $14BN, with growth slowing sharply, while margins remain massively negative, and billions of cash losses pile up - and that best case was pre-COVID!\n\nNow, UBER faces a sharply diminished TAM, or total addressable market, as it gives up its ambitions to expand beyond taxi-hailing and food delivery, and major American and international corporations in various industries, including technology, media, real estate, airlines, hotels, and entertainment destinations all prepare us for a world of sharply diminished transportation needs. Where workers will shift to permanently working from home; where international travel will be diminished for years; where even domestic destination travel will face diminished capacity and utilization.\n\nNone of this has yet sunk into the minds of equity market investors.\n\nTHESIS\n\nDiminution of Total Addressable Market.\u00a0Uber is likely abandoning its ambitions to be a leader and create a revenue generating business in nearly every area besides its core taxi-hail and food delivery business. These early-non-core businesses, while inchoate and pre-revenue, gave investors hope that UBER was not just an old-fashioned transportation company making use of the latest technology - smartphone apps - but an actual technology company, with the same opportunity for horizontal expansion as Amazon. This hope was among the reasons why a negative cash burn of several billion dollars for a seemingly mundane business could turn into a $59 BN valuation. That hope is gone.\n\nFor its remaining core business, taxi-hail, the world has changed:\n\nNegative Secular Changes to UBER\u2019s Core Business\n\nFirst, we start with the massive secular change we are witnessing in the American workplace. Then, we move on to the lengthy and even semi-permanent changes to restaurants and travel.\n\nWe are witnessing a generational acceleration in work-from-home, in which commuting to and from work is facing the biggest and fastest change in its history. Companies such as Google, Square, and Twitter are preparing for a future in which employees may work remotely \u2013 forever. Others such as Facebook, JP Morgan, Citibank, American Express and Microsoft have taken steps in this direction. Employees who commuted to these workplace jobs were often customers of UBER. Many of these customers and their \"rideshare\" business won\u2019t come back. Here is a sampling of recent headlines that will negatively impact UBER - for at least several quarters in some cases, permanently in others:\n\nFirst, Twitter. This one is permanent:\n\n\ufffc\n\nNext, we have Square, also offering permanence:\n\n\ufffc\n\nNow, we turn to Facebook, who for now, is only planning until the end of the year:\n\n\ufffc\n\nNow we will shift to the banks, which are not only continuing work from home, but also seeking semi-permanent shifts away from urban centers, another hit to UBER's business:\n\n\ufffc\n\nCiti is but one example; the list goes on and on, and is only growing by the day.\n\nNext, we have buy in to work from home from the media, who indicate that working from home is the right thing to do:\n\n\ufffc\n\nAnd the NY Times weighs in on the nascent trend:\n\n\ufffc\n\n\ufffc\n\n\ufffc\n\nWe also have consultancies now adding their voices to the chorus of work from home:\n\nSurveys also indicate there is a new and growing movement for work-from-home accommodations. Global Workplace Analytics, a leading authority on integrated work at home strategies, recently published a report in which they forecast that as much as 25-30% of the workforce will be working from home by the end of 2021. See the full report here:\n\nWork-at-Home After Covid-19-Our Forecast - Global Workplace Analytics\n\nThese are the thought leaders. We are witnessing a tsunami of potentially permanently lost taxi-hail business for these former commuters. While some of the headlines may say only through 2020, these arrangements are likely to be made permanent in many cases.\n\nAnd now, the rest of the ride-share customer universe: the restaurant, travel and leisure industry have been decimated, with full year 2020 volumes estimated to be down anywhere from nearly 20% (fast food) to 40% (hotels) to more than 50% (airlines and certain destination-based entertainment.)\n\nObviously, none of these industries by themselves comprise UBER's exact customer base, but taken collectively, they are representative of what has happened to the total addressable market: it is severely impaired.\n\nSelected Peer Group Performance 2020\n\nThroughout the latest strategy retreat, 25% work force reduction, revenue collapse, junk debt capital raise, and multi-billion dollar cash burn, one thing stands out: UBER\u2019s high flying stock, which has surged this week along with the NASDAQ market to a new high for the year of $59 billion, now up 16% on the year. Stated another way, stock buyers have treated COVID-19 and its catastrophic impact on UBER\u2019s revenues and margins as a net positive catalyst. This stands in stark contrast to the many other companies operating in and round UBER\u2019s universe, including hotels, airlines, lodging, office space, and even other \u201cunicorns\".\n\nWe highlight the 2020 changes in valuation of numerous companies that derive revenues from similar underlying strategic drivers as UBER: commuting to work, commuting to airports, commuting to leisure activities, commuting to restaurants and bars, and commuting to vacation. We lay out the year to date equity returns, followed by consensus changes to 2020 forecast revenues. Every data point indicates UBER\u2019s valuation change is completely inconsistent with its related peer group.\n\nFirst, we frame UBER\u2019s equity valuation change year to date, along with the consensus expectation for 2020 Revenues, and list how they have changed, showing the January 1, 2020 consensus estimate, followed by the current 2020 consensus estimate.\n\nAs you can see, UBER is up 16% year to date, while its 2020E Revenue expectations have been reduced by 29%.\n\n\ufffc\n\nThen, we turn to the various comparably impacted industries, as described above. We start with Airlines, as airports are a primary source and destination of UBER customers, and note the average hit to airline valuation has been 66%, while the average expected hit to revenues in 2020 has been 56%.\n\n\ufffc\n\nNext, we look at Hotels, a common destination and origin for UBER customers, where you can see the average hotel has taken a 39% valuation hit, while the expected revenue decline is 40%.\n\n\ufffc\n\nOffice REITS, which we also use as a proxy of demand for commuting to work, have seen an average 42% decline in valuation, with only a 5% hit to revenues. Here, the financial forecasts are out of sync with the change in valuation. Even the out years look similar. Expect the numbers to come down, significantly.\n\n\ufffc\n\nRestaurants are a large and fractured group, and we chose McDonalds as simply a directional indicator:\n\n\ufffc\n\nAnd finally, the still-private \u201cunicorns\u201d, who bear much structural similarity to UBER, particularly AirBnB which also was forced to fire 25% of its work force, and to reduce its strategic scope to \u201ccore\u201d operations while giving up on growth opportunities. Here, you will see that AirBnB recently took a 52.6% hit to its private market valuation since 2019, and WeWork took a 60% hit to its December 2019 valuation (which was itself an 84% hit to its January 2019 valuation). AirBnB\u2019s CEO also wrote a letter that sounds nearly identical to UBER\u2019s CEO \u201cI\u2019m-sorry-but-you\u2019re-fired, our business is collapsing\u201d letter.\n\n\ufffc\n\nThe overall context should be clear: UBER's entire ecosystem has experienced a volume and valuation collapse compared to UBER's year to date double digit stock price growth. This stock price growth is inconsistent with the underlying data.\n\nWe specifically concede that none of these companies are perfect comparables, but all derive revenues from a similar ecosystem: the home-work-travel-leisure nexus, and their customers must be transported somehow to their offices, their hotels, their airports, and their leisure AirBnB vacations. Together, they paint a picture: UBER\u2019s equity price has largely ignored the reality of a collapsed ecosystem, and is the only related equity that not only has not collapsed, but is actually UP double digits on the year.\n\nWill UBER\u2019s business come back? Absolutely, some of it will come back. The travel/airline/hotel transport nexus actually has the highest probability of coming back, but the longest lead time. These won\u2019t see even a near-full recovery for several years, in line with forecasts for hotel and airlines revenue. The most at risk revenue is actually related to work commuting: many employers are in the process of shifting to permanent work-from-home arrangements. UBER will never recover this revenue. Much of the work commute revenue IS NEVER COMING BACK. Thus, UBER's TAM has shrunk.",

You think I just keep getting lucky, punks? Do you have any idea how unlikely that is?\n\n \n\nWell, let's take a look at what the fuckstick Kevin Cook from Zacks wrote on 3/5:  \n\n[How Many Sigmas Was the Flash Correction Plunge?](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/many-sigmas-flash-correction-plunge-222010752.html) \n\n&gt;\"Did you know that last week's 14% plunge in the S&amp;P 500 SPY was so rare, by statistical  measures, that it shouldn't happen once but every 14,000 years?\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"By several measures, it was about a 5-sigma move, something that's not \"supposed to\" happen more than once in your lifetime -- or your prehistoric ancestors' lifetimes!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"According to general statistical principles, a 4-sigma event is to be expected about every 31,560 days, or about 1 trading day in 126 years. And a 5-sigma event is to be expected every 3,483,046 days, or about 1 day every 13,932 years.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn 3/5, TQQQ closed at $81. I just got lucky, right? You should buy after a 5-sigma move, right? That's what fuckstick says:\n\n&gt;\"Big sigma moves happen all the time in markets, more than any other field where we collect and analyze historical data, because markets are social beasts subject to \"wild randomness\" that is not found in the physical sciences.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This was the primary lesson of Nassim Taleb's 2007 book The Black Swan, written before the financial crisis that found Wall Street bankers completely ignorant of randomness and the risks of ruin.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I also took advantage of the extreme 5-sigma sell-off by grabbing a leveraged ETF on the Nasdaq 100, the ProShares UltraPro QQQ TQQQ. In my plan, while I might debate the merits of buying AAPL or MSFT for hours, I knew I could immediately buy them both with TQQQ and be rewarded very quickly after the 14% plunge.\"\n\nAhahaha, fuckstick bought TQQQ at $70, cuz that's what you do after a random 5-sigma move, right? How many of you dumbasses did the same thing? Don't lie, I see you buying 3/5 on this TQQQ chart: \n\n![img](9ks35zdla5151)\n\nMeanwhile, on 3/3, I answered the question \"Where do you see this ending up at in the next couple weeks? I have 3/20s\" with \"under 30 imo\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell good fucking job, because a week later on 3/11, TQQQ closed at $61, and it kept going.\n\n[Nomura: Market staring into the abyss](https://www.macrobusiness.com.au/2020/03/nomura-market-staring-into-the-abyss/) \n\n&gt;\"The plunge in US equities yesterday (12 March) pushed weekly returns down to 7.7 standard deviations below the norm. In statistical science, the odds of a greater-than seven-sigma event of this kind are astronomical to the point of being comical (about one such event every 160 billion years).\n\nLet's see what Stephen Mathai-Davis, CFA, CQF, WTF, BBQ, Founder and CEO of Q.ai - Investing Reimagined, a Forbes Company, and a major fucktard [has to say at this point](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephenmathaidavis/2020/03/11/time-to-buy-stocks-selling-otm-put-spreads-looks-better/):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\"Our AI models are telling us to buy SPY (the SPDR S&amp;P500 ETF and a great proxy for US large-cap stocks) but since all models are based on past data, does it really make sense? \"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"While it may or may not make sense to buy stocks, it definitely is a good time to sell \u201cvolatility.\u201d And yes, you can do it in your brokerage account!

No, dumbass, you try to figure out what Billy's doing. And in this case it was pretty obvious, Billy saw the Fed train coming and wanted to close his shorts. So you give the dude a hand, quick short in and out, and position for Billy dumping his short bags.  \n\n[Video of Billy &amp; the Fed train](https://giphy.com/gifs/cheezburger-fail-train-near-miss-l2Sq3kNYfshvzwoBq)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's what Billy boy says:\n\n&gt;\u201cBut if they don\u2019t, and the government takes the right steps, this hedge could be worth zero, and the stock market could go right back up to where it was.

I gave y\u2019all a 150-bagger.  \n\nSo how could I catch that? Because it wasn't random, yo. And I'm here to teach your asses how to try to spot such potential moves. But first, the technical bootcamp.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Chapter III. Mouthbreather's bootcamp on managing a position \u2013 THE TECHNICALS**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**RULE 1. YOU NEVER BUY OPTIONS AT OPEN.** You NEVER OVERPAY for an option. You never FOMO into buying too fast. You NEVER EVER NEVER pump the premium on a play.\n\nI saw you fuckers buying over 4k TQQQ 5/22 $45 puts in the first minutes of trading. You pumped the premium to over $0.50 dudes. The play's never going to work if you do that, because you give the market maker free delta, and he's going to hedge that against you. Let me explain simply:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's say a put on ticker $X at strike $50 is worth $1, and a put at strike $51 is worth $2. \n\nIf you all fomo in at once into the same strike, the market maker algos will just pull the asks higher. If you overpay at $2 for the $50p, the market maker will just buy $51ps for $2 and sell you $50ps for 2$. Or he'll buy longer-dated $50ps and sell you shorter-dated $50ps. Max risk for him is now 0, max gain is $1. You just gave him free downside insurance, so of course he's going to start going long. And you just traded against yourself, congrats.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou need to get in with patience, especially if you see other autists here wanting to go in at the same time. Don't step on each other's toes. You put in an order, and you wait for it to fill for a couple of seconds. If it doesn't fill, AND the price of the option hasn't moved much recently, you can bump the bid $0.01. And you keep doing that a few times. Move your strikes, if needed. Only get a partial fill or don't get a fill at all? You cancel your bid. Don't fucking leave it hanging there, or you're going to put a floor on the price. Let the mm algos chill out and go again later. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**RULE 2. WATCH THE TIME**. Algos are especially active at x:00, x:02, x:08, x:12, x:30 and x:58. Try not to buy at those times.\n\n**RULE 3. YOU USE MULTIPLE BROKERS.** Don't just roll with Robinhood, you're just gimping yourself. If you don't have another one, open up a tasty, IB, TD, Schwab, whatever. But for cheap faggy puts (or calls), Robinhood is the best. If you want to make a play for which the other side would think \"That's free money!\", Robinhood is the best. Because Citadel will snag that free money shit like no other. Seriously, if you don't have a RH account, open one. It's great for making meme plays.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**RULE 4. YOU DON'T START A TRADE WITH BIG POSITIONS.** Doesn't matter how big or small your bankroll is. If you go all-in, you're just gambling, and the odds are stacked against you. You need to have extra cash to manage your positions. Which leads to\n\n**RULE 5. MANAGING YOUR WINNERS**: Your position going for you? Good job! Now **POUND THAT SHIT!** And again. Move your strikes to cheaper puts/calls, and pound again. And again. Snowball those gains. \n\n \n\n**RULE 6A. POUND THOSE $0.01 PUTS:**  \n\nSo you bought some puts and they\u2019re going down? Well, the moment they reach $0.01, **YOU POUND THOSE PUTS** (assuming there\u2019s enough time left on them, not shit expiring in 2h). $0.01 puts have amazing risk/return around the time they reach $0.01. This is not as valid for calls. Long explanation why, but the gist of it is this: you know how calls have unlimited upside while puts have limited upside? Well it\u2019s the reverse of that.\n\n**RULE 6B. MANAGING YOUR LOSERS:** \n\nYour position going against you? Do you close the position, take your loss porn and post it on wsb? **WRONG DUMBASS**. You manage that by **POUNDING THAT SHIT**. Again and again. You don't manage losing positions by closing. That removes your gainz when the market turns around. You ever close a position, just to have it turn out it would have been a winner afterwards? Yeah, don't do that. You manage it by opening other positions. Got puts? Buy calls. Got calls? Buy puts. Turn positions into spreads. Buy spreads. Buy the VIX. Sell the VIX. They wanna pin for OPEX? Sell them options. Not enough bankroll to sell naked? Sell spreads. Make them fight you for your money, motherfuckers, don't just give it away for free. When you trade, YOU have the advantage of choosing when and where to engage. The market can only react. That's your edge, so USE IT! Like this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExample 1: \n\nInitial TQQQ 5/22 position = $5,000. Starts losing? You pound it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](gq938ty8e5151)\n\nTotal pounded in 5/22 TQQQ puts = $10,824. Unfortunately expired worthless (but also goes to show I'm not selling you puts, dickwads)\n\nThen the autists show up:\n\n&gt;\"Hahaha you lost all your money nice job you fucking idiot why do you even live?\" - /u/cscqb4\n\nWrong fuckface. You see the max pain at SPX 2975 &amp; OPEX pin coming? Sell them some calls or puts (or spreads). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](7nv23fr41a151)\n\nSold 9x5/20 SPX calls@2975, bam +$6,390. Still wanna pin? Well have some 80x5/22 TQQQ $80cs, bam anotha +$14,700.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](1iqtpmc71a151)\n\n\\+$21,090 - $10,824 = +$10,266 =&gt; Turned that shit into a +94.85% gain. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;[./u/cscqb4 rn](https://giphy.com/gifs/smile-angry-kanye-west-ZI88V08ZzgMWA) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou have a downside position, but market going up or nowhere? You play that as well. At least make some money back, if not profit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExample 2:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5/22, long weekend coming right? So you use your brain &amp; try to predict what could happen over the 3-day weekend. Hmm, 3 day weekend, well you should expect either a shitty theta-burn or maybe the pajama traders will try to pooomp that shite on the low volume. Well make your play. I bet on the shitty theta burn, but could be the other, idk, so make a small play. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSold some ES\\_F spreads (for those unaware, ES is a 50x multiplier, so 1 SPX = 2 ES = 10 SPY, approximately). -47x 2955/2960 bear call spreads for $2.5. Max gain is $2.5, max loss is 2960-2955 = $5. A double-or-nothing basically. That's $5,875 in premium, max loss = 2x premium = $11,750. \n\nWell, today comes around and futures are pumping. Up to 3,014 now. Do you just roll over? You think I'm gonna sit and take it up the ass? Nah bros that's not how you trade, you fucking fight them. How?\n\nI have:\n\n47x 2960 calls\n\n\\-47x 2955 calls\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPajama traders getting all up in my grill? Well then I buy back 1 of the 2955 calls. Did that shit yesterday when futures were a little over 2980, around 2982-ish. Paid $34.75, initially shorted at $16.95, so booked a -$892 loss, for now. But now what do I have?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n46x 2955/2960 bear calls\n\n1x 2960 long call\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the fuckers can pump it. In fact, the harder they pump it, the more I make. Each $2.5 move up in the futures covers the max loss for 1 spread. With SPX now at \\~3015, that call is $55 ITM. Covers 24/46 contracts rn. If they wanna run it up, at 3070 it's break-even. Over that, it's profit. I'll sell them some bear call spreads over 3050 if they run it there too. They gonna dump it? well under 2960 it's profit time again. They wanna do a shitty pin at 3000 today? Well then I'll sell them some theta there.\n\nLater edit: that was written yesterday. Got out with a loss of only $1.5k out of the max $5,875. Not bad.\n\nAnd that, my dudes, is how you manage a position.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**RULE 7 (ESPECIALLY FOR BEARS). YOU DON'T KEEP EXTRA CASH IN YOUR BROKER ACCOUNT.** You don't do it with Robinhood, because it's a shitty dumpsterfire of a broker. But you don't do it with other brokers either. Pull that shit out. Preferably to a bank that doesn't play in the markets either, use a credit union or some shit. Why? Because you're giving the market free liquidity. Free margin loans. Squeeze that shit out, make them work for it. Your individual cash probably doesn't make a dent, but a million autists with an extra $1200 trumpbucks means $1.2b. That's starting to move the needle. You wanna make a play, use instant deposits. And that way you don't lose your shit when your crappy ass broker or bank gets its ass blown up on derivative trades. Even if it's FDIC or SIPC insured, it's gonna take time until you see that money again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Chapter IV. BUSTING YOUR RETARDED MYTHS**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MYTH 1 - STONKS ONLY GO UP**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo you think the market can go up forever? Do you think stOnKs oNLy Go uP because Fed brrr? Do you think SPX will be at 5000 by the end of the month? Do you think $1.5 trillion is a good entry point for stonks like AAPL or MSFT? Do you want to buy garbage like Hertz or American Airlines because it's cheap? Did you buy USO at the bottom and are now proud of yourself for making $2? Well, this section is for you!\n\nLet's clear up the misconception that stonks only go up while Fed brrrs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat's your target for the SPX top? Think 3500 by the end of the year? 3500 by September? 4000? 4500? 5000? Doesn't matter, you can plug in your own variables. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's say SPX only goes up, a moderate 0.5% each period as a compounded avg. (i.e. up a bit down a bit whatever, doesn't matter as long as at the end of your period, if you look back and do the math, you'll get that number). Let's call this variable BRRR = 0.005.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCan you do the basic math to calculate the value at the end of x periods? Or did you drop out in 5th grade? Doesn't matter if not, I'll teach you. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's say our period is one week. That is, SPX goes up on average 0.5% each week on Fed BRRR:\n\n2950 \\* (1.005\\^x), where x is the number of periods (weeks in this case)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, after 1 month, you have: 2950 \\* (1.005\\^4) = 3009\n\nAfter 2 months: 2950 \\* (1.005\\^8) = 3070\n\nEnd of the year? 2950 \\* (1.005\\^28) = 3392\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow clearly, we're already at 3015 on the futures, so we're moving way faster than that. More like at a speed of BRRR = 1%/wk\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2950 \\* (1.01\\^4) = 3069\n\n2950 \\* (1.01\\^8) = 3194\n\n2950 \\* (1.01\\^28) = 3897\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBetter, but still slower than a lot of permabulls would expect. In fact, some legit fucks are seriously predicting SPX 4000-4500 by September. Like this dude, David Hunter, \"Contrarian Macro Strategist w/40+ years on Wall Street\". IDIOTIC.\n\n[https://twitter.com/DaveHcontrarian/status/1263066368414568448](https://twitter.com/DaveHcontrarian/status/1263066368414568448)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat'd be 2950 \\* (BRRR\\^12) = 4000 =&gt; BRRR = 1.0257 and 2950 \\* (BRRR\\^12) = 4500 =&gt; BRRR = 1.0358, respectively. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's why that can't happen, no matter the amount of FED BRRR: **Leverage. Compounded Leverage.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's currently over $100b in leveraged etfs with a 2.5x avg. leverage. And that's just the ones I managed to tally, there's a lot of dogshit small ones on top of that. TQQQ alone is now at almost $6b in AUM (topped in Fed at a little over $7b).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, let's try to estimate what happens to TQQQ's AUM when BRRR = 1.0257. 3XBRRR = 1.0771. Take it at 3XBRRR = 1.07 to account for slippage in a medium-volatility environment and ignore the fact that the Nasdaq-100 would go up more than SPX anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n$6,000,000,000 \\* (1.07\\^4) = $7,864,776,060\n\n$6,000,000,000 \\* (1.07\\^8) = $10,309,100,000\n\n$6,000,000,000 \\* (1.07\\^12) = $13,513,100,000\n\n$6,000,000,000 \\* (1.07\\^28) = $39,893,000,000. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat if BRRR = 1.0358? =&gt; 3XBRR = 1.1074. Take 3XBRRR = 1.10.\n\n$6,000,000,000 \\* (1.1\\^4) = $8,784,600,000\n\n$6,000,000,000 \\* (1.1\\^8) = $12,861,500,000\n\n$6,000,000,000 \\* (1.1\\^12) = $18,830,600,000\n\n$6,000,000,000 \\* (1.1\\^28) = $86,526,000,000\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd this would have to get 3x leveraged every day. And this is just for TQQQ.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's do an estimation for all leveraged funds. $100b AUM, 2.5 avg. leverage factor, BRRR = 1.0257 =&gt; 2.5BRRR = 1.06425\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n$100b \\* (1.06\\^4) = $128.285b\n\n$100b \\* (1.06\\^8) = $159.385b\n\n$100b \\* (1.06\\^12) = $201.22b\n\n$100b \\* (1.06\\^28) = $511.169b\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat'd be $1.25 trillion sloshing around each day. And the market would have to lose each respective amount of cash into these leveraged funds. Think the market can do that? You can play around with your own variables. But understand that this is just a small part of the whole picture, many other factors go into this. It's a way to put a simple upper limit on an assumption, to check if it's reasonable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the long run, it doesn't matter if the Fed goes BRRR, if TQQQ takes in it's share of 3XBRRR. And the Fed can't go 3XBRRR, because then TQQQ would take in 9XBRRR. And on top of this, you have a whole pile of leveraged derivatives on top of these leveraged things. Watch (or rewatch) this: [Selena Gomez &amp; Richard H. Thaler Explaining Synthetic CDO through BLACKJACK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUM59Eh6vTw) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy general point, at the mouth-breather level, is that Fed BRRR cannot be infinite, because leverage.\n\nAnd these leveraged ETFs are flawed instruments in the first place. It didn't matter when they started out. TQQQ and SQQQ started out at $8m each. For the banks providing the swaps, for the market providing the futures contracts, whatever counter-party to whatever instrument they would use, that was fine. Because it balanced out. When TQQQ made a million, SQQQ lost a million (minus a small spread, which was the bank's profit). Bank was happy, in the long run things would even out. Slippage and spreads and fees would make them money. But then something happened. Stonks only went up. And leveraged ETFs got bigger and more and more popular. \n\nAnd so, TQQQ ended up being $6-7b, while SQQQ was at $1b. And the same goes for all the other ETFs. Long leveraged ETF AUM became disproportionate to short AUM. And it matters a whole fucking lot. Because if you think of the casino, TQQQ walks up every day and says \"I'd like to put $18b on red\", while SQQQ walks up and says \"I'd only like to put $3b on black\". And that, in turn, forces the banks providing the swaps to either eat shit with massive losses, or go out and hedge. Probably a mix of both. But it doesn't matter if the banks are hedged, someone else is on the other side of those hedges anyway. Someone's eating a loss. Can think of it as \"The Market\", in general, eating the loss. And there's only so much loss the market can eat before it craps itself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you were a time traveller, how much money do you think you could make by trading derivatives? Do you think you could make $20 trillion? You know the future prices after all... But no, you couldn't. There isn't enough money out there to pay you. So you'd move the markets by blowing them up. Call it the Time-travelling WSB Autist Paradox. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you had a bucket with a hole in the bottom, even if you poured an infinite amount of water into it, it would never be full. Because there's a **LIQUIDITY SINK**, just like there is one in the markets.\n\nAnd that, my mouth-breathing friends, is the reason why FED BRRR cannot be infinite. Or alternatively, \"**STONKS MUST GO BOTH UP AND DOWN**\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MYTH 2 - YOU CAN'T TIME THE MARKET**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Jan 14, 2020, I predicted this: Assuming that corona doesn't become a problem, \"AAPL: Jan 28 $328.3, Jan 31 $316.5, April 1 $365.7, May 1 $386, July 1 $429 December 31 $200.\"\n\nNow take a look at the AAPL chart in January. After earnings AAPL peaked at $327.85. On 1/31, after the 1st hour of trading, when the big boys make moves, it was at $315.63. Closed 1/31 at $309.51. Ya think I pulled this one out of my ass too? \n\nYes you can time it. Flows, motherfucker, flows. Money flow moves everything. And these days, we have a whole lot of **RETARDED FLOW**. Can't even call it dumb flow, because it literally doesn't think. Stuff like:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* ETF flows. If MSFT goes up and AAPL goes down, part of that flow is going to move from AAPL to MSFT. Even if MSFT flash-crashes up to $1000, the ETF will still \"buy\". Because it's passive. \n* Option settlement flows. Once options expire, money is going to flow from one side to another, and that my friends is accurately predictable from the data.\n* Index rebalancing flows\n* Buyback flows\n* 401k passive flows\n* Carry trade flows\n* Tax day flows\n* Flows of people front-running the flows\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd many many others. Spot the flow, and you get an edge. How could I predict where AAPL would be after earnings within 50 cents and then reverse down to $316 2 days later? **FLOWS MOTHERFUCKER FLOWS**. The market was so quiet in that period, that is was possible to precisely figure out where it ended up. Why the dump after? Well, AAPL earnings (The 8-K) come out on a Wednesday. The next morning, after market opens the 10-Q comes out. And that 10-Q contains a very important nugget of information: the latest number of outstanding shares.  But AAPL buybacks are regular as fuck. You can predict the outstanding shares before the market gets the 10-Q. And that gives you EDGE. Which leads to\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MYTH 3 - BUYBACKS DON'T MATTER** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAre you one of those mouthbreathers that parrots the phrase \"buybacks are just a tax-efficient way to return capital to shareholders\"? Well sit the fuck down, I have news for you. First bit of news, you're dumb as shit. Second bit:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn 1/28, AAPL's market cap is closing\\_price x free\\_float\\_outstanding\\_shares. But that's not the REAL MARKET CAP. Because the number of outstanding shares is OLD AS FUCK. When the latest number comes out, the market cap changes instantly. And ETFs start moving, and hedges start being changed, and so on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\"But ETFs won't change the number of shares they hold, they will still hold the same % of AAPL in the index\" - /u/random_wsb_autist\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh my fucking god you're dumb as fuck. FLOWS change. And the next day, when TQQQ comes by and puts its massive $18b dong on the table, the market will hedge that differently. And THAT CAN BE PREDICTED. That's why AAPL was exactly at $316 1 hour after the market opened on 1/31. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, what can you use to spot moves? Let me show you:\n\n \n\nMarket topped on 2/19. Here\u2019s SPY. I even marked interesting dates for you with vertical lines.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](7agm171eh5151)\n\nNobody could have seen it coming, right? WRONG AGAIN. Here:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](i1kdp3cgh5151)\n\nIn fact, JPYUSD gave you two whole days to see it. Those are NOT normal JPYUSD moves. But hey maybe it\u2019s just a fluke?  Wrong again.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](fsyhenckh5151)\n\nForex showed you that all over the place. Why? FLOWS MOTHERFUCKER FLOWS. When everything moves like that, it means the market needs CASH. It doesn\u2019t matter why, but remember people pulling cash out of ATMs all over the world?  Companies drawing massive revolvers? Just understand what this flow means.  \n\nThe reversal: \n\n![img](4xe97l0oh5151)\n\n![img](v6i0pdmoh5151)\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just forex. Gold showed it to you as well. Bonds showed it to you as well.\n\n![img](40j53u8th5151)\n\nEven god damn buttcoin showed it to you.\n\n![img](43lvafhvh5151)\n\nAnd they all did it for 2 days before the move hit equities.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **Chapter V. LIQUIDITY NUKE INBOUND**\n\n \n\nYou see all these bankruptcies that happened so far, and all the ones that are going to follow? Do you think that\u2019s just dogshit companies and it won\u2019t have major effects on anything outside them? WRONG.\n\nBecause there\u2019s a lot of leveraged instruments on top of those equities. When the stock goes to 0, all  those outstanding puts across all expirations get instantly paid.   \n\nUnderstand that Feb-March was a liquidity MOAB. But this will end with a liquidity nuke.  \n\nHere\u2019s just HTZ for example: $239,763,550 in outstanding puts. Just on a single dogshit small-cap company (this thing was like $400m mkt. cap last week).\n\nAnd that\u2019s just the options on the equity. There\u2019s also instruments on etfs that hold HTZ, on the bonds, on the ETFs that hold their bonds, swaps, warrants, whatever. It\u2019s a massive pile of leverage.  \n\nThen there\u2019s also the ripple effects. Were you holding a lot of HTZ in your brokerage margin  account? Well guess what big boi, when that gaps to 0 you get a margin call, and then you become a liquidity drain. Holding long calls? 0. Bonds 0. **DOG SHIT!**\n\nAnd the market instantly goes from holding $x in assets (HTZ equity / bonds / calls) to holding many multiples of x in LIABILITIES (puts gone wrong, margin loans, derivatives books, revolvers, all that crap). And it doesn\u2019t matter if the Fed buys crap like HTZ bonds. You short them some. Because when it hits 0, it\u2019s no longer about supply and demand. You get paid full price, straight from Jerome\u2019s printer. Is the Fed going to buy every blown up derivative too? Because that's what they'd have to do.\n\nThink of liquidity as a car. The faster it goes, the harder it becomes to go even faster. At some point, you can only go faster by driving off a cliff. THE SQUEEZE. But you stop instantly when you hit the ground eventually. And that\u2019s what shit\u2019s doing all over the place right now.\n\nRewatch: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hG4X5iTK8M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hG4X5iTK8M)\n\nAnd just like that fucker, \u201cI\u2019m standing in front of a burning house, and I\u2019m offering you fire insurance on it.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Don\u2019t baghold!**\n\nNow is not the time to baghold junk. Take your cash. Not the time to buy cheap crap. You don\u2019t buy Hertz. You don\u2019t buy USO. You don\u2019t buy airlines, or cruises, or GE, or motherfucking Disney. And if you have it, dump that shit.  \n\nAnd the other dogshit that\u2019s at ATH, congrats you\u2019re in the green. Now you take your profits and fucking dump that shit. I\u2019m talking shit like garbage SaaS, app shit, AI shit, etc. Garbage like MDB, OKTA, SNAP, TWLO, ZM, CHGG etc.\n\nAnd you dump those garbage ass leveraged ETFs. SQQQ, TQQQ, whatever, they\u2019re all dogshit now.  \n\nThe leverage MUST unwind. And once that\u2019s done, some of you will no longer be among us if you don\u2019t listen. A lot of leveraged ETFs will be gone. Even some non-leveraged ETFs will be gone. Some brokers will be gone, some market makers will be gone, hell maybe even some big bank has to go under. I can\u2019t know which ones will go poof, but I can guarantee you that some will. Another reason to diversify your shit. There\u2019s a reason papa Warrant Buffet dumped his bags, don\u2019t think you\u2019re smarter than him. He may be senile, but he\u2019s still a snake.\n\nAnd once the unwind is done, THEN you buy whatever cheap dogshit\u2019s still standing.  \n\nGot it? Good.\n\nYou feel ready to play yet?  Alright, so you catch a move. Or I post a move and you wanna play it. You put on a small position. When it\u2019s going your way, **YOU POUND DAT SHIT.** Still going? Well **RUSH B CYKA BLYAT AND PLANT THE GOD DAMN 3/20 $30p BOMB.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Chapter VI - The mouthbreather-proof play - THE AKIMBO**\n\n \n\nStill a dumbass that can\u2019t make a play? Still want to go long? Well then, I got a dumbass-proof trade for you. I present to you THE AKIMBO:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSTEP 1.  You play [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hE2O2FjZ-g) full blast. You need some real Russian hardbass to get you in the right mood for trading, cyka.\n\nSTEP 2. Split your play money in 3. Remember to keep extra bankroll for POUNDING THAT SHIT.\n\nSTEP 3. Use 1/3 of your cash to buy SQQQ 9/18 $5p, pay $0.05. Not more than $0.10.\n\nSTEP 4. Use 1/3 of your cash to buy TQQQ 9/18 $20p, pay around $0.45. Alternatively, if you\u2019re feeling adventurous, 7/17 $35p\u2019s for around $0.5.\n\nSTEP 5. Use 1/3 of your cash to buy VIX PUT SPREADS 9/15 $21/$20 spread for around $0.15, no more than $0.25. That is, you BUY the 21p and SELL the 20p. Only using Robinhood and don\u2019t have the VIX? What did I just tell you? Well fine, use UVXY then. Just make sure you don\u2019t overpay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Chapter VII - Quick hints for non-mouthbreathers**\n\nQuick tips, cuz apparently I'm out of space, there's a 40k character limit on reddit posts. Who knew? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Proshares is dogshit. If you don't understand the point in my last post, do this: download [https://accounts.profunds.com/etfdata/ByFund/SQQQ-historical\\_nav.csv](https://accounts.profunds.com/etfdata/ByFund/SQQQ-historical_nav.csv) and [https://accounts.profunds.com/etfdata/ByFund/SQQQ-psdlyhld.csv](https://accounts.profunds.com/etfdata/ByFund/SQQQ-psdlyhld.csv).  Easier to see than with TQQQ. AUM: 1,174,940,072. Add up the value of all the t-bills = 1,686,478,417.49  and \"Net other assets / cash\". It should equal the AUM, but you get 2,861,340,576.  Why? Because that line should read: NET CASH = -$511,538,344.85\n2. Major index rebalancing June 22.\n3. Watch the violent forex moves.\n4. 6/25 will be red. Don't ask, play a spread, bag a 2x-er.\n5. 6/19 will be red.\n6. Not settled yet, but a good chance 5/28 is red.\n7. Front run the rebalance. Front-run the front-runners of the rebalance too. TQQQ puts. \n8. Major retard flow in financials yesterday. Downward pressure now. GS 180 next weeks looks good.\n9. Buy leaps puts on dogshit bond ETFs (check holdings for dogshit)\n10. Buy TLT 1/15/2021 $85ps for cheap, sell over $1 when the Fed stops the ass rape, rinse and repeat\n11. TQQQ flow looks good:\n\n![img](untvykuxea151)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck.

        "selftext": "Guys there\u2019s so much info and ppl arguing about MVIS is it true is it not. Should I sell tomorrow, should I sell before call, should I risk it all and wait. \n\nTruth is no one can tell you, but here are some pointers from the past 24hrs.\n\nMVIS is tied to MSFT, just look at their product it\u2019s literally the same thing. https://youtu.be/uIHPPtPBgHk\n\nThe volume on this guy has 190 million more than S&amp;P!!! That\u2019s 3x the amount in just one day!!\n\nThere was for a fact a whale that manipulated the price, this cause triggers to offset, with a panic sell for ppl trying to short this thing.\n\nPatent was approved today, even if you think it\u2019s false, read it carful and you\u2019ll see MVIS referenced. Again Holo lens comparison.\n\nMany MVIS employees are NOW MSFT employees, one in particular is a senior researcher (hint hint)\n\nThey are in the process to updating the holo lens to holo lens 2.\n\nMSFT can continue to pay royalties, buy them out after they\u2019ve paid their debt off, or honestly this company continues to grow because holo lens is the future.\n\nI don\u2019t believe this is a pump and dump, I believe this is to good to be true. If you want to sell to make a quick buck fine, but my own opinion, do your own DD, this guy is a win-win-win. Yes, there will be a bumpy road to the upside, but after the news either announced on the 7th after hours at 5pm, or 19th, I think based on the CEOs letter for exploring potential acquisition or merger on 5/1. We have good evidence to believe this is the real deal.\n\nMore info from investors hub\n\n\u201dEx Microsoft (MSFT) Employees now work at MicroVision (MVIS) \nAfter some research by the community, a staggering amount of ex Microvision employees have been scooped up by Microsoft over the years. This growing list leads to suggest that Microsoft is very interested in MicroVisions technology and capabilities. \n\nJosh Miller \u2013 Director of Engineering at Microsoft and former Lead Systems Engineer \u2013 HoloLens (6 years at MVIS as Director of System Engineering) \n\nScott Woltman \u2013 Director Hardware Engineering at Microsoft (5 years at MVIS as Senior Staff Engineer, Systems) \n\nRichard James \u2013 Director of Optical Engineering HoloLens, former Director of Sourcing \u2013 Advanced Optics (14 years at MVIS as Director, Opto-Mechanical Engineering) \n\nWyatt Davis \u2013 Principal Engineer at Microsoft (15 years at MVIS as Principal Engineer/MEMS Technical Lead) \n\nJeb Wu \u2013 Principal Hardware Engineer HoloLens HW Design at Microsoft (5 years at MVIS as Sr. Staff Engineer) \n\nJohnson Liu \u2013 Principal Optical Engineer (3 months at MVIS as Staff Engineer) \n\nMark Champion \u2013 Principal Systems Engineer (6 years at MVIS as Principal Engineer) \n\nMason Thomas \u2013 Principal Program Manager (3 1/2 years at MVIS as Lead Systems Engineer for DARPA eye ware display) \n\nGreg Gibson \u2013 Senior Electrical Engineer at Microsoft (11 years at MVIS as Electronics Engineering Manager) \n\nDaniel Nevistic \u2013 Hardware Development Engineer \u2013 (2 years at MVIS as Electronics Engineer) \n\nMichael Beard \u2013 Senior Optics Test Manager \u2013 HoloLens, Senior Hardware Engineer (8 years at MVIS as Lead Systems Engineer of Image Quality) \n\nShawn Swilley \u2013 Senior Hardware Engineering Manager, former Sr. Hardware Engineer (7 years at MVIS as Senior Staff Engineer) \n\nJustin Zilke \u2013 Embedded Systems Engineer (4 years at MVIS as Lead Engineer, Embedded Firmware) \n\nMinhua Liang \u2013 Optical Engineer (6 years at MVIS as Sr. Staff Engineer) \n\nDamon Domjan \u2013 Senior Embedded Systems Engineer (5 years at MVIS as Firmware Engineer) \n\nRobert Hilker \u2013 Manager HW Test Engineering at Microsoft (11 years at MVIS as Director, Global Manufacturing Technology) \n\nBill Woodland \u2013 Sr. Director Strategic Sourcing (9 years at MVIS as Sr. Director) \n\nTaha Masood \u2013 Sr. Manager for Strategic Technology Sourcing for Augmented &amp; Mixed Reality Products at Microsoft (6 years at MVIS as Director, System Engineering, Design-Win and Technology Integration) \n\nJack Clevenger \u2013 Sr. Program Manager (12 years at MVIS as Sr. Program Manager) \n\nMoh Eslamy \u2013 Process development working for both Microsoft and MicroVision (6 years at MVIS managing high volume manufacturing/assembly processing for laser projector) \n\nKarlton Powell \u2013 Senior Researcher (8 years at MVIS as Senior Research Engineer) \n\nGiven both companies are headquartered in Redmond, WA, a Microsoft acquisition of MicroVision could be an extremely easy transition for both the company and employees. \n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) currently using MicroVision (MVIS) Technology in HoloLens \nOn March 31, 2020, Microvision agreed to an agreement for its April 2017 customer to take over production of the components MicroVision had been producing for the customer. Beginning in March MicroVision started earning a royalty on each component shipped that was approximately equal to the gross profit it earned on each component it had previously produced. \n\nAround the same exact time, Microsoft started expanding production capabilities for its Hololens in order to meet higher demands for the product. \n\nAnd to follow that up, the Army which is currently planing to equip its first units with the Integrated Visual Augmentation System toward the end of next year, thanked Microsoft for the expanded commitment to meet production demands. \n\n\u201cOur Microsoft partners have been outstanding in reforming the supply chain where necessary and continuing on with the development in their production and manufacturing facility in California\u201d \n\nAnd if the dots aren\u2019t connecting enough, immediately after this on April 6th, MicroVision stated their first clue of possibly entering a buyout of some sort. \u201cAs we reported on March 11, we are actively engaged with multiple interested parties to evaluate various opportunities to license our IP as well as other strategic alternatives.\u201d \n\nWhile no one knows for sure if MicroVision\u2019s technology is in the Hololens, there have been some confirming reports stating that may be the case (found under Hybrid Arrive section). \n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\u2019s Possible Expanded Use of MicroVision (MVIS) Technology \nThe connection between MicroVision and Microsoft is almost undeniable when it comes to the Hololens reports and timelines. But an additional use of their tech may change everything. \n\n\n\nThere are rumors and evidence that Microsoft is using MicroVision technology in their new expanded capability with the Xbox. Microsoft expanding their use of MicroVision technology can show us their interest and commitment to the technology, and also validate why they might think about buying MicroVision out. \n\nIt\u2019s interesting to note that Microsoft announced an Xbox Series X gameplay reveal event for Thursday, May 7, the same day as MicroVisions conference call. Whether anything of substance is announced is yet to be seen\u201d\n\nBelow are some links! Please share info, news and insight.

        "selftext": "Over the course of the past couple of months, I\u2019ve seen countless posts of new investors risking their hard earned savings and dumping it in stocks that they believe will go back up to pre-pandemic levels. Stocks don\u2019t always recover. Industries that will most likely take a very long time to recover will be risky, and you will really need to be careful in the travel industry stocks like airlines, cruises, hotels, etc. People aren\u2019t going to feel comfortable traveling as much, and with so many people losing their jobs, the last thing on their mind is what next big cruise they are going to go on when their pockets are empty.\n\nToo many new investors are trying to chase stocks all the way up with FOMO, and it\u2019s not worth it.\n\nToo many investors don\u2019t even understand the business they just purchased shares in, they only bought it because someone on the internet said \u201cIt\u2019s going to the moon\u201d or their friend said that this magical penny stock will be the next MSFT, etc.\n\nToo many investors don\u2019t look at the balance sheet of the companies stocks they have purchased. I have seen countless posts on here saying \u201cThis stock is about to skyrocket! BUY! BUY! BUY!\u201d And you look into the balance sheet and you see why the stock price has been going down for 10+ years, because they are drowning in debt.\n\nThere is a company behind every stock, and unless you can understand the company and explain it easily, don\u2019t buy the stock. Stick to what you know, or be optimistic and ready to learn about a company so you know where your money is going.\n\nTLDR: Please read the balance sheet, and understand the company behind the stocks you are purchasing. Don\u2019t follow the herd. Risk doesn\u2019t always lead to reward. Have a good day!",

        "selftext": "To open I will make a bold claim, the rumors are true. Why do I think so, because that\u2019s a pre-requirement for what follows to make sense. You can call me insane, idgaf. \n\nSomeone knows the above and has orchestrated a massive scheme to profit on this fact. We\u2019ll call them whales. \n\nWhales started the buyout rumor in order to get the volume up. Nobody knows where this rumor started, MSFT using MVIS technology in their shit has been public knowledge for years. Probably pumped the stock a bit themselves, FOMO in full effect, then pumped it some more in extended hours using the fact that the volume is low, most stocks don\u2019t move much in extended hours mind you. If you look at the past few days majority of gains happened during extended hours. Let it run for a few days to further build up the volume. Pump again during extended hours, keep that FOMO going. This was Friday and Monday.\n\nThen came yesterday (Tuesday), normal start although the momentum started to fizzle down. Then came the stop raid. Why, a few reasons, get some cheap stocks, shake off a chunk of the weaker hands, get an estimate of how much you can really crash it, trigger an SSR breaker, and lower the confidence into the stock which in turn lowers the volume. Then just let it recover or pump it up a bit, you need less volume but you still need a lot of volume to pull this shit off.\n\nThis brings us into today (Wednesday), not much growth since yesterday, the momentum fizzled out but those who were holding were holding hoping to sell during late Wednesday or early Thursday or push their luck and sell before the call, few planned to actually brave the earnings report and conference call. None of us believed the rumor to be true. \n\nThen came the massive dip, courtesy of a fake news headline, bots/trolls spreading it around, and probably some good old fashioned market manipulation. \n\nThis brings us to accumulation. The chart behaved weird, frequently just trading in a 2 cent range for hours, like there were points where it broke out in either direction but it basically stayed in 1.08 to 1.10 range for a large chunk of the trading session. This brings us to the SSR breaker, once that\u2019s tripped for the rest of the trading day and the next day you can only place a short sale order at a higher price than the current price. So shorts had to play ball and sell for 1.10 or 1.09 when the price was at 1.08. A dip like that attracted a lot of shorts looking for a quick buck. The whales have eaten up all the short sales coming in and the weak hands getting out and are holding millions of shares. There was no recovery in the after hours today. Why, cause they don\u2019t need it. The minor spike in AH was probably some dumber shorts getting burned and having to cover.\n\nTomorrow (Thursday) the trading day is going to be a sideways slide with close to 0 net change, it\u2019s gonna look like the tail end of a one day runner after its done spiking, whoever was going to panic sell panic sold already. SSR breaker got tripped and volume is going to be in the gutter (buyers have no confidence in this bullshit anymore, shorts can\u2019t bring it down, whales have fed).\n\nAfter hours the rumors will be confirmed to true. Yes Microsoft or at least someone is buying, might be Facebook, might be Amazon, might be Tesla, might be someone else. Price will absolutely explode between the moment that\u2019s said and 8 PM. \n\nFriday, FOMO is again in full effect, everyone is chasing the stock, whales will either unload or just hold until buyout comes. Past Friday, who fucking cares, this is penny land after all.",

        "selftext": "Those DD posts all spammed yesterday. So much evidence the stock is going higher.\n\n-12% today.\n\nGreat work guys. DD is another way of saying \"I have no idea what I'm doing, so I'll rationalize why my trade will work.\" The mob of reddit upvotes it, because they're clueless, and now you got yourself a bunch of new bagholders.\n\nPerhaps it's a good thing these traders lose. Buying long on some of these companies, just downright stupid. \n\nStupid money is good. While it's sometimes painful to read the overwhelming amount of bullshit on this subreddit, every now and then something new comes along. Nowadays, we have the next hype stock posted daily. It's comical. \n\nHere's each point broken down:\n\n**Recklessly long-biased**\n-\n\n99.85% of all posts on here are long biased \"hot stock picks.\" I suspect many traders wouldn't be long if they had the choice. Unfortunately, robinhood and most mainstream brokers don't have the shares to borrow. So, instead of admitting it's impossible to profit long-term by swinging these pumps long, these traders double down. Like playing slots, they are always the losers, because they don't even know they are playing against the house.\n\n**Incompetent**\n-\n\nEver notice how each stock pick, those hype picks that you see on the front page, always fail? They always drop, even after a week. Those, like myself, who bring up the fact they fail, are met with usual replies:\n\n* You need to sell sooner rather than later\n\n* I bought before the pump even started\n\n* Gibberish about how the company is great\n\n* I'm a bad person for even suggesting the idea they'll fail\n\nNow all these vapid arguments all have one thing in common, the person has a vested interest in the stock. It's pretty amusing, because they create posts that are entirely emotion based. Some are more clever. Emotional based posts under the auspices of \"DD.\" I'll get to why this subreddits \"DD\" is nothing more than confirmation bias.\n\n**Shockingly uniformed**\n-\n\nNewbie traders, who admit they're new, should be given the benefit of the doubt. Although, newbies helping newbies create more newbie decisions, perhaps this is a bad cycle. While I can't prove it, sometimes there are manipulative forces that jump into subreddits like this. They mask themselves as \"arbiters of preforming proper DD.\" These people are nothing more than newsletter frauds, who have blended in to almost seem real. \n\nRead into astroturfing.\n\nEver notice how many DD posts contain a laundry list of reasons why a company is a good buy. Where is that short-biased DD? One side of the trade is correct, so perhaps there's more to it then \"microsoft may have a stake in it.\" Ironically, if you keep track of these hype stocks posted on here, all that DD is laughable. Re-read a few from a couple months ago. Check where those stocks ended up. \n\n**Never profitable long term**\n-\n\nOver the past 5 years, I've seen this subreddit grow into something pretty insane. A new stocktwits has formed. Pumpers, gullible sheep, and the occasional good trader make up the population on here. I remember posting similar things 5 years ago. These traders, who were confident in their positions at the time, would fire back at my contrarian arguments by saying my arguments are wrong. How many of these traders survived?\n\nNone.\n\nNone of those accounts, over 100 traders, survived.... except myself. I was short-biased, they were long-biased. Wave after wave, month after month, newbie traders are flushed out. Gullible traders, otherwise known as sheep, are the first ones to blow up. They are the slot machine players. The buyers into these hype stocks creating \"DD\" as a mask for their confirmation bias. \n\nCMV.",

        "selftext": " I pasted [the article](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2020/05/07/the-market-v-the-real-economy), to exempt you from registering an account to read it.\n\n##Financial markets have got out of whack with the economy. Something has to give\n\nSTOCK MARKET HISTORY is packed with drama: the 1929 crash; Black Monday in 1987, when share prices lost 20% in a day; the dotcom mania in 1999. With such precedents, nothing should come as a surprise, but the past eight weeks have been remarkable, nonetheless. A gut-wrenching sell-off in shares has been followed by a delirious rally in America. Between February 19th and March 23rd, the S&amp;P 500 index lost a third of its value. With barely a pause it has since rocketed, recovering more than half its loss. The catalyst was news that the Federal Reserve would buy corporate bonds, helping big firms finance their debts. Investors shifted from panic to optimism without missing a beat.\n\nThis rosy view from Wall Street should make you uneasy (see article). It contrasts with markets elsewhere. Shares in Britain and continental Europe, for example, have recovered more sluggishly. And it is a world away from life on Main Street. Even as the lockdown eases in America, the blow to jobs has been savage, with unemployment rising from 4% to about 16%, the highest rate since records began in 1948. While big firms\u2019 shares soar and they get help from the Fed, small businesses are struggling to get cash from Uncle Sam.\n\nWounds from the financial crisis of 2007-09 are being reopened. \u201cThis is the second time we\u2019ve bailed their asses out,\u201d grumbled Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, last month. The battle over who pays for the fiscal burdens of the pandemic is just beginning. On the present trajectory, a backlash against big business is likely.\n\nStart with events in the markets. Much of the improved mood is because of the Fed, which has acted more dramatically than other central banks, buying up assets on an unimagined scale. It is committed to purchasing even more corporate debt, including high-yield \u201cjunk\u201d bonds. The market for new issues of corporate bonds, which froze in February, has reopened in spectacular style. Companies have issued $560bn of bonds in the past six weeks, double the normal level. Even beached cruise-line firms have been able to raise cash, albeit at a high price. A cascade of bankruptcies at big firms has been forestalled. The central bank has, in effect, backstopped the cashflow of America Inc. The stockmarket has taken the hint and climbed.\n\nThe Fed has little choice\u2014a run on the corporate-bond market would worsen a deep recession. Investors have cheered it on by piling into shares. They have nowhere else good to put their cash. Government-bond yields are barely positive in America. They are negative in Japan and much of Europe. You are guaranteed to lose money by holding them to maturity, and if inflation rises the losses would be painful. So stocks are appealing. By late March prices had fallen by enough to tempt the braver sort. They steeled themselves with the observation that much of the stockmarket\u2019s value is tied to profits that will be made long after the covid-19 slump has given way to recovery.\n\nTellingly, though, the recent rise in share prices has been uneven. Even before the pandemic the market was lopsided, and it has become more so. Bourses in Britain and continental Europe, chock-full of troubled industries like carmaking, banking and energy, have lagged behind, and there are renewed jitters over the single currency (see article). In America investors have put even more faith in a tiny group of tech darlings\u2014Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft\u2014which now make up a fifth of the S&amp;P 500 index. There is little euphoria, just a despairing reach for the handful of businesses judged to be all-weather survivors.\n\nAt one level, this makes good sense. Asset managers have to put money to work as best they can. But there is something wrong with how fast stock prices have moved and where they have got back to. American shares are now higher than they were in August. This would seem to imply that commerce and the broader economy can get back to business as usual. There are countless threats to such a prospect, but three stand out.\n\nThe first is the risk of an aftershock. It is entirely possible that there will be a second wave of infections. And there are also the consequences of a steep recession to contend with\u2014American GDP is expected to drop by about 10% in the second quarter compared with a year earlier. Many individual bosses hope that ruthless cost-cutting can help protect their margins and pay down the debts accumulated through the furlough. But in aggregate this corporate austerity will depress demand. The likely outcome is a 90% economy, running far below normal levels.\n\nA second hazard to reckon with is fraud. Extended booms tend to encourage shifty behaviour, and the expansion before the covid crash was the longest on record. Years of cheap money and financial engineering mean that accounting shenanigans may now be laid bare. Already there have been two notable scandals in Asia in recent weeks, at Luckin Coffee, a Chinese Starbucks wannabe, and Hin Leong, a Singaporean energy trader that has been hiding giant losses (see article). A big fraud or corporate collapse in America could rock the markets\u2019 confidence, much as the demise of Enron shredded investors\u2019 nerves in 2001 and Lehman Brothers led the stockmarket down in 2008.\n\nThe most overlooked risk is of a political backlash. The slump will hurt smaller firms and leave the bigger corporate survivors in a stronger position, increasing the concentration of some industries that was already a problem before the pandemic. A crisis demands sacrifice and will leave behind a big bill. The clamour for payback will only grow louder if big business has hogged more than its share of the subsidies on offer. It is easy to imagine windfall taxes on bailed-out industries, or a sharp reversal of the steady drop in the statutory federal corporate-tax rate, which fell to 21% in 2017 after President Donald Trump\u2019s tax reforms, from a long-term average of well over 30%. Some Democrats want to limit mergers and stop firms returning cash to their owners.\n\nFor now, equity investors judge that the Fed has their back. But the mood of the markets can shift suddenly, as an extraordinary couple of months has proved. A one-month bear market scarcely seems enough time to absorb all the possible bad news from the pandemic and the huge uncertainty it has created. This stock market drama has a few more acts yet.\u25a0",

High prices were signalled in [MSFT](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/MSFT/LWCMh0jH-Microsoft-Setting-Up-For-Hard-Landing/), [BRK](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/BRK.A/bHDf6D7j-Buffet-s-the-King-of-the-Bag-Holders/), [SPCE](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/SPCE/uFAroqOi-SPCE-and-Gravity/), [GOOG](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/GOOG/m56g98mU-Weekly-Bearish-Butterfly-Pattern/). A high on [AMZN was called](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/AMZN/b4DOD5dy-The-Amazon-Bubble/), but price later traded higher. The best signal generated was a buy on the [TVIX from 34 to 800.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/TVIX/ts9VcIlG-TVIX-Long-Term-Trend-Line-Break/)\n\nIn the month of March , 2020, the bubble popped. Most risk based assets and indices crashed over 30%. First analysis post said to [wait for a bounce to sell into](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/nVbfBVXn-Dow-Bounces-Like-a-Brick-While-Making-Big-Breakout/), but this was updated before the market opened to say prices could fall [8% and then 30% in March.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/01/30-dow-jones-drop/) At this point the TradingView account was suspended. Only one account is allowed, and this was set up specifically for a 2020's bear market. So no further posts or updates were made there.\n\nOn the 3rd of March came the first signal to [look for the down move entering somewhere in the 16,000 - 18,000 area](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/16/dow-jones-enters-end-of-denial-stage-and-start-of-the-bull-trap/) on the Dow Jones. Followed by a post on the 16th of March saying [we're entering into the bull trap.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/31/optimism-in-the-air-as-end-of-bull-trap-approaches/) The low on the Dow would be made around 18,250 on the 23rd of March. From here a rally began which has made a current high of 24,500.\n\nApril of 2020 has been the bull trap month. Some losing signals have been generated in the later couple weeks of April. A few calls on the top of the bull trap have been made. Prices have not went substantially higher, they've just not dropped. A forecast on the [17th of April marks the current high](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/16/17th-april-2020-the-bull-trap-completes/), but it looks like price can trade a bit higher. A post on the 19th of April calls for a crash in the S&amp;P500 to [1,600 within the next 5 - 10 weeks](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/19/19th-of-april-here-comes-an-attitude-readjustment/).\n\nToday is the 25th of April. Over the last two weeks forecasts of a big drop starting have been inaccurate. I very strongly suspect this is akin to the sell signals generated in late January and early February. It's the right idea, but it's just the wrong time. A top in the Dow Jones somewhere in the 24,000 - 25,000",

        "selftext": "Hey retards, this is my first time doing one of these things, not really sure how to start but hear me the fuck out because I'm about to shill the fuck outta some company called poly or plantronics, whatever the ticker is $PLT and that's all that matters. **$PLT 15c 6/19**\n\n**Plantronics** is a leading global designer, manufacturer, and marketer of lightweight communications headsets, audio solutions, telephone headset systems, other communication endpoints, and accessories for the business and consumer markets. They develop enhanced *communication* [products](https://www.poly.com/us/en/products) for *offices*, contact centers, mobile devices, cordless phones, computers and gaming consoles. So essentially they make communication equipment and electronics for offices.\n\nWho specifically do they make this communication equipment for? Idk, maybe some of the largest cloud based communication companies in the entire world right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Strategic Alliances](https://preview.redd.it/u0im7d1w8fz41.png?width=1120&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06ceb7cfd37c14b346dee1a40ce51b73351d5055)\n\nNot only do they have contracts and specialized equipment developed for [Microsoft Teams](https://www.poly.com/us/en/solutions/platform/microsoft) , [Mother Fucking Zoom](https://www.poly.com/us/en/solutions/platform/zoom), [Five9](https://www.poly.com/us/en/solutions/platform/five9), [Amazon](https://poly.com/us/en/solutions/platform/amazon), and [Google](https://www.poly.com/us/en/solutions/platform/google) but they also have contracts with the largest employer in the United States - the [Federal Fucking Government](https://www.poly.com/us/en/solutions/industry/government) \\- specifically the [GSA](https://www.poly.com/us/en/solutions/industry/public-sector).\n\nWhy does that matter, because we're in a massive fucking pandemic, the entire world is closed and the company corporate work culture will probably never return to 'normal'. What does that mean, that means that people are working from home more now than ever, and people will continue to work from home in the foreseeable future ([check this link](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/5-ways-the-future-of-work-is-changing-due-to-coronavirus/), [and this one](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/29/how-the-coronavirus-pandemic-will-impact-the-future-of-work.html), [maybe even this one](https://www.wbur.org/bostonomix/2020/03/25/coronavirus-work-from-home-office-culture)). Corporations and the public sector, offices in general will downsize and people will continue to work from home. The demand for cloud-based conferences/tech and working from home is high and about to get a whole lot higher. AKA THE DEMAND FOR FUCKING PLANTRONICS PRODUCTS, YES EVEN THE STUPID SAVI 8200 HEADSET, IS ABOUT TO SKY ROCKET ITSELF OUT OF DEBT!! $$ FREE MONEY\n\nLets talk about **DEBT.** The only think downgrading Plantronics is their longterm Debt to Equity - 2.76. Scary right? Nope, wrong. Debt is scary to three kinds of people, BOOMERS, DOOMERS and POOR people. We're degenerative gamblers here, we embrace debt, we buy into debt, we are debt. Buy $PLT. I have $7000 worth of credit card debt and a $5000 default lightstream loan, am I'm afraid of debt, nope... that's what bankruptcy is for.\n\nSeriously though, we shouldn't you be afraid of Plantronics debt? The majority of their debt was accumulated in purchase of Polycom and their process of re-branding. They took in a whopping $700 million of net debt from their purchase in 18'. They're debt is on a current downtrend, from and overall $1.74 billion in 18' to their last reporting on Dec 19' of 1.62 billion, they also had a reported $171.1 million in cash, so their net debt currently stands at about $1.45 billion. Covid is hurting a ton of companies, but one industry it isn't is tech.t Look at the success [Logitech is having](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/logi). If Plantronics never made another sale, this would be an issue, but with the current industry expectations, this isn't anything to be worried about. More sales will bring in more cash, and their debt will be neutralized... eventually.\n\n# PLT Earnings are expected on [5/27/2020](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/plt)\n\nThey were originally scheduled for 5/21, but AH on Friday they delayed to 5/27. Consensus is expecting shit earnings, nobody is expecting anything positive to come of their earnings report, especially after this earnings delay. Only a fool would play earnings, it's the ultimate [contrarian](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-theory/08/contrarian-investing.asp) play.\n\nExpected EPS is .09, down from last quarter. EPS are expected to be down, when demand for their products is expected to be up due to covid. If you look at their previous year's earnings, they're a profitable company. But they've gotten fucked by the absolutely fucked by the [2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/05/01/1494397/0/en/Plantronics-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2018-Financial-Results.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[2017-2018 EPS](https://preview.redd.it/n8wyev909fz41.png?width=710&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7dc36d3e4ba3700d5dc1dc2909352601a5b3077)\n\n[Income Tax](https://preview.redd.it/vh2khvq09fz41.png?width=696&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0a427760d2f7d0b1ff6736cc7838b8a8abd543d)\n\nPlantronic's revenue dipped in 2018 due to re-branding from the purchase of poly and the 2017 income tax pump, but their next report is going to announce a massive pump in revenue due to Covid-19. Plantronic's is fundamentally a profitable company, but on paper they look fuckin anemic. Not only will sales and revenue increase, in this quarter, but again, with the change of work force, their products will continue to be in demand.\n\n[Plantonic's website traffic](https://www.similarweb.com/website/poly.com#overview)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Poly.com](https://preview.redd.it/y0kvfb439fz41.png?width=1062&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99483c28723bd9b4a0d6167556eb569e8f4be914)\n\n**Price Targets?**\n\n[Finviz - $18](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLT)\n\n[Marketbeat - $41](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/PLT/price-target/)\n\n[Investor Averages - $17.33](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/plt/analyst-research)\n\n**Technicals**\n\n[dum oversold - nearing market mover cross-over](https://preview.redd.it/e91vumo49fz41.png?width=1311&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e93cca4a0409f857a5c2284b332fb44b60a37285)\n\n[nearing MACD bullish crossover](https://preview.redd.it/2vmt7o669fz41.png?width=1308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c098bf22f9b8ad8b3afddcd48b0749bd6329df6)\n\nTo conclude, $PLT is the ultimate Contrarian play, go against these Will Meade look-a-like hedge fund retards and look at my autistic DD I provided you guys above. It's literally free money. Worse that happens, you lose maybe $5-$6, the best that could happen, you listen to me, thehappyitalian, you tip me some of the money you make and you go out buy yourself a Tesla.\n\ntl;dr  **$PLT 15c 6/19**",

One uses market cap, another is equally weighted. \n\n* [S&amp;P 500](https://us.spindices.com/indices/equity/sp-500) -8.52% YTD\n* [S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Index (EWI) ](https://us.spindices.com/indices/equity/sp-500-equal-weighted) -16.68% YTD\n\n\nSummary: Composition of stocks market changed after initial market drop. Those companies that do well in pandemic are already large and move the whole index. Many other companies stay down and can go even bankcrupt.     \n(And they say that passive indexing removes infomation from the market. It's not doing it yet) \n\n---\n\nThis insight is provided to you by https://www.npr.org/2020/05/22/861331371/stocks-are-up-but-the-economys-down\n\n&gt; \u2026 when the coronavirus pandemic started forcing the U.S. economy to shut down in late February, the stock market tanked for the next month. By late March, it was down 34%. But then, even though the economy has kept getting worse and worse, the U.S. stock market has started to recover. It rebounded in a big way so that now it is only down 13% from where it was in February before the recession started. \u2026 And meanwhile, millions of workers keep losing their jobs each week. \u2026  the stock market did beat the real economy to what was happening, and it reprised really quickly. And then all of a sudden, it became a battle of the composition of the stock markets.\n\u2026 the whole stock market collapsed when coronavirus started hurting the U.S. economy, but then some stocks of companies started recovering even as others continued to struggle.\n\u2026  it just so happens that the companies that are the best positioned for the environment we find ourselves in and what we will find ourselves in over the next six months to a year, the companies that are best positioned happen to already be the largest weighted components of the indices.\n\u2026  companies like Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple and Alphabet, a.k.a. Google - are also some of the most valuable companies in the country. In fact, just those five companies make up about 20% of the entire S&amp;P 500 \u2026 when those five stocks do well, they can help pull up the whole index.\n\u2026  First markets dropped in panic sell. Then  companies who don't suffer from the pandemic recovered and the composition of index changed.  Big tech companies happen to be already large part of market cap of SP500, so they bring up the SP500 as a whole. \n\u2026  aside from Amazon, which has almost a million workers, a lot of these companies don't actually employ that many people. Microsoft only has 144,000 workers. Facebook has just 48,000 workers. And this can partly explain why tens of millions of people can lose their jobs while the stock market keeps going up.\n\u2026   not all companies are the same. Some big ones are doing fine, pulling up the stock market. Others are struggling, possibly going bankrupt, laying off workers.",

You've probably heard of Slack. Their earnings will be on June 4th. I believe the hype around this stock will cause it to Moon before earnings and that's the play we are making here, who cares what happens after they print, we are here for the run-up. Like many other tech meme stonks, they run before earnings and there is still time to take advantage of that run up with a few weeks of lead, while the greeks are still in our favor and premiums are low.\n\n**Words:** Slack has become a household name (read: Meme) in the WFH world and is becoming the \"bandaid\" brand of the work communications the same way ZM is. Both it and Microsoft Teams are basically priced nearly the same for equivalent tiers of service but teams has had a slower marketing start than WORK. Slack has also beaten earnings since IPO and should expect to see an even higher earnings expectation with the rise in WFH.\n\n**Trends:** Slack peaked at its IPO and stayed above teams throughout since and saw another spike that coincided with teams when the market was nearing the recent bottom.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/296a09c1ory41.png?width=894&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2490a44816a5c71e5760fea7fa73b10d40c9fde2\n\nSince its bottom in March, the share price has steadily increased and in the past 2 weeks is seeing faster if still volatile growth and is hitting its ATH since the initial IPO sell-off WORK experienced.\n\nVoodoo BS TA: Bottom side resistance is strong at 30 and continues to see a higher peak. I don't believe in TA but the trend is the trend. Interest in the last month has increased the price by almost 25% already.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8m847qhiory41.png?width=553&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=425473d629563cca0dc5bca82e26fca68b498bae\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fi919axjory41.png?width=522&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d6ffd6c9c45d6bf568d7d7d91f623ab0da42967\n\nTL;DR / Don't sleep on Slack and capture the run-up to earnings AH on 4 June, sell before close.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAutist Positions:\n\n40c 5/22 - They are basically free right now\n\n31c 5/29\n\n32c 6/5\n\n35c 6/5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Seeing a lot of early hate here. I am trying to create a helpful post about a position I believe in and will continue to hold as time comes. Please give me better feedback than \"pump and dump\" so that I can increase my post quality and not get called a scammer. My interest is only to perform the same service to you guys that I've taken from other DD posters where I see the opportunity to do so. Thanks Retards.",

        "selftext": "For all of you that spent today FOMOing into $DBX, listen up. Although they have recovered well from their COVID low, $BOX has plenty of room to run and this may finally be the chance for some of you to make a play better than just bending over for an IV crush. **TLDR: $BOX calls**\n\n#Overview\n\nEven amid all of the recent hype for $DBX, $BOX hasn't gotten the love that it deserves. Where $DBX spends most of their time making small money on the consumer front or on limited basic enterprise plans, $BOX focuses on playing with the big money (like the MMs that steal your weekly allowance). To give a bit of background, let's get into the background and then their latest 10-K.\n\n&gt;With our Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) cloud content management platform, users can collaborate on content both internally and with external parties, automate content-driven business processes, develop custom applications, and implement data\nprotection, security and compliance features to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, internal policies and industry standards and regulations . . .  Our platform enables a broad set of business use cases across enterprises, hundreds of file formats and media types, and user experiences. Our platform integrates with leading enterprise business applications, and is compatible with multiple application environments, operating systems and devices, ensuring that workers have access to their critical business content whenever and wherever they need it.\n\nAs a common theme, you'll continue to see this enterprise focus throughout, but it gets better.\n\n&gt;Our go-to-market strategy is focused on selling our cloud content management platform as a solution for the entire enterprise with the full set of Box capabilities, leveraging our product suite offerings, and driving high-value significant business outcomes for our customers . . .  We focus our efforts on larger enterprises, capitalizing on international growth, and utilizing our partner ecosystem, where most advantageous . . . We offer nearly 1,500 integrations with partners including Microsoft, IBM,\nSalesforce.com, Apple, Google, Slack, Adobe, Palo Alto Networks, Okta, Zoom and others, giving our users easy access to their content in Box without leaving these applications. \n\nSee some familiar names here? Those are the stocks that you've already missed the boat on. Beyond that, if you take a look at their site, you can look at some of the big names already using Box in their business: Morgan Stanley, GE, Intuit, AstraZeneca, etc. \n\nEven their CEO himself has been out trying to [tell everyone to hop on for the ride](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-24/box-ceo-aaron-levie-sees-cloud-growth-during-coronavirus), but hopefully the news coming out of the $DBX call was enough to convince you that it's viable. \n\nIf we get into their financials, you'll see strong revenue growth YoY from about $600M for the year ending 1/31/2019 to $700M on 1/31/2020. Although they have recorded a net loss each year, it's primarily driven by sales and marketing expense (45% revenue and declining YoY). When your product sells itself in this pandemic, that becomes a bit less of an issue. The balance sheet is a bit weak with limited cash and substantial A/R that may be problematic, but given the nature of their customer base and limited leverage, it shouldn't be as big of a concern.\n\nIn terms of revenue generation, I'll direct you to their [Enterprise License Agreement](https://cloud.app.box.com/s/xec0gl0gqcgverpn2rw0r4kkzqycdsme). These are 3 year agreements which include implementation and full integration into the Box platform. Over the past couple of months, even a few large organizations signing up for these are going to make it rain tendies, but I'd bet you see massive growth here. Because enterprise customers on broad platform integrations tend to be locked in for a while, it's going to lead to incredibly strong guidance.\n\n#Why now?\n\n$BOX reports earnings on 5/27, so for once you'll have the chance to get in *before* the big run up. As of now, premiums are still low and have plenty of room to run. The best part here is that because $BOX hates their accountants, their fiscal year ends on 1/31, so their quarterly earnings on 5/27 will include actual numbers through 4/30/20. Because of this, they'll have a good 2 months worth of pure COVID gains to showcase. Analysts are estimating about $0.05 EPS, but I'd bet on that being revised up and still beaten. The window may start to close as the market reacts to the $DBX earnings and detail from their conference call, but there's still time to get in tomorrow.\n\n#My Positions\n\n$BOX 6/19 17c\n\n$BOX 6/19 20c\n\nI entered started building the position earlier today and am already up about 20%, but I plan to hold over the next couple of weeks and use any dips as an opportunity to add more. As always, do your own research and mind your personal risk tolerance.",

        "selftext": "The saying, \"The stock market predicts the future\" is older than most of us, yet most discard it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\u201cI always believe that **prices move** first and **fundamentals** come second.\u201d\n\n\\~ Paul Tudor Jones\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can prove to **any thinking person** that extreme price moves can be forecast (within a *reasonable* margin of error) by understanding price patterns. All I need you to do is to suspend disbelief for long enough to consider the facts of the matter.  To engage in civil disagreement and to be receptive to evidence and testing.  I used to think this was not much to ask, March taught me better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've learned those who pretend to be asleep can not be awakened, so at this point I am only talking to those of you who can understand the difference between rational and radical. Sceptical and cynical.   **I'm speaking to the rational sceptics.** The people too  smart to believe what  I say, and not dumb enough to not bother to check if I might just be right.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know that most big price moves in the market can be seen before they happen, and that when they happen there will  usually be news that is synchronised along with it. From a casual perspective, the news moves the market; but the move can be seen setting up before the news happens. It is in the charts first, and then it is in the news  later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Listen, I get it!\n\n# I know that sounds dumb.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI absolutely, fully, understand that saying that is just like saying there is an  elephant in the tree. Right away your mind comes up with all the reasons an  elephant can not be in the tree. I GET THAT.  Be sceptical. Doubt what is doubtful,  do not refuse to look.  If you refuse to look, this is ignorance disguised as scepticism. If you can be shown, I can show you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt doesn't \"Make sense\", but it does happen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Classic Template of a Bubble\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBubbles have always formed in extremely similar ways and anyone who understood how a bubble template worked and remained focused on executing trade plans based upon  that template would have always made a fortune. **This is a fact.** You can dispute if this will  happen again, but upon  full examination of the evidence it is indisputable it was the case for all  previous crashes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\"People forecasting market crashes are always wrong!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe the boy who cries wolf has better eye sight.  To see something coming and to time the trades of that thing are really quite different. Picking a top is very hard because no matter what form of analysis you use there will be multiple false signals thrown out.  From all forms of analysis I know of, typically about 3 - 5 false signals come before the real trade.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3 - 5 failed attempts is plenty to lure folks into thinking Cassandras of Wall Street should be mocked without due consideration, but rarely do any of these signals produce sells levels more than 20% off the mark.  The trouble is, in a bull market if you call a bear people will laugh at you for being wrong each time the market goes up 0.05%. Which is why I say a *reasonable* margin or error is required.\n\nFor example, in  late February I said if the Dow breaks under 29,000  [it could start to crash](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/LiV4pmmH-Dow-Jones-Crucial-Downside-Break-Possible/).   That happened, but there are people here who seen me posting daily warning them this was coming (on other platforms) who'll say  my forecasts do not matter because [I was wrong in January.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/RGkn3RjW-Dow-Jones-Crucial-Support-Levels-in-the-Week-Ahead/)  The market went up 600 points and down 10,000.  Here I learned only aim things at reasonable people. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got this market top (and it went really well for me). I did not get it first time. I had some small  stop outs (as I do in ANY trade), but I did nail it.  I've posts from January [saying I was looking for it.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/SPX/KY1p7aZa-50-Years-Could-End-in-Tears-for-US-Indices/)   Posts in February calling [both the  high and low of the move.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/Cd6Il3np-Next-Series-of-Falls-Can-Take-Dow-Down-10-000-Points/)   I've shown how I used patterns from  the previous crashes over the [last 100 years to forecast this.](https://www.reddit.com/user/2020sbear/comments/fwo5ut/it_shouldnt_work_but_over_the_last_100_years_this/)   I forecast [the low in  March](https://imgur.com/a/5bNi7vz), then the [move through April](https://imgur.com/a/WX5kwCP) (Full post for [previous links](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/16/dow-jones-enters-end-of-denial-stage-and-start-of-the-bull-trap/)) and then to watch for good news transfer over to [bad news around 25,000 Dow](https://imgur.com/a/OUy2dTM) ([Full  post](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/31/optimism-in-the-air-as-end-of-bull-trap-approaches/))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've done all of this during times when everyone seems to think the market is entirely \"Irrational\" and making \"Unprecedented moves\" that I could not predict because  I've \"Never lived through a pandemic\" - but if the market is so irrational and doing things it's never done before,  why are you watching the news and wonder WTF is going on in the market in April, and I am writing posts about it in  March? I'm not smart. I just studied the patterns. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do not know why it works. More and more as  I see it working while bad things are happening I wish it did not work, but it does. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you go through all my posts  you'll see my forecasts are very accurate. I'm sometimes a bit out. Often I make trades that I could have done better on. I am not perfect. I'm aware of my need for improvement in  various areas of my analysis - but the fact I am sometimes a bit wrong does not mean this is not working.  Me not being flawless does not mean there is not merit to what I'm using. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been right more than 90% of people I  see. I'm not bragging, I must spend 10,000% more time on this than 99% of people and so it stands to reason I understand it better.  I'm not smart, I just believe in something that works and most of you  think is a subject for mockery. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point in the pattern what would now be expected is [news events to start to slide](https://www.reddit.com/user/2020sbear/comments/gatjxp/whatever_it_is_will_be_on_the_news/).  Something a bit bad. Then something a lot bad. Followed by something terrible.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you study the patterns of history, the conditions of now [best sync up with the Great Depression](https://www.reddit.com/user/2020sbear/comments/fwohg1/why_we_believe_the_us_and_world_may_be_heading/).  I know it's almost a meme to say that now, but it was not when I started saying it - every day was a new all time high when [I started to talk about it.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/SPX/KY1p7aZa-50-Years-Could-End-in-Tears-for-US-Indices/) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBelow is pasted a run through of trades and forecasts this year.

In 2000 and 2008 we seen the early 'Bear trap' sections of the bubble and then in the following decade we seen enthusiasm become greed and greed become delusion. The 30% gain in the S&amp;P500 through the year 2019 was the final stages of this bubble.\n\nHere is a post describing us being in the ['Delusion' stage of the bubble in January of 2020](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/SPX/KY1p7aZa-50-Years-Could-End-in-Tears-for-US-Indices/).\n\nThe pop of this bubble and the following bear market will not be a nice fast one like the crashes of 2000 and 2008, it will be a more drawn out affair where prices drop far lower. The crash of the 2020's will be more like the crash of the 1930's depression. See the analysis [leading to this conclusion here.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/01/us-indices-bubble-in-style-reflecting-the-great-depression-of-1930/)\n\nIn the months of January and February major US indices traded into the zone where a bubble template would be looking for the top to be made. Read about how this method has [worked in previous crashes here.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/05/how-technical-analysis-has-signalled-previous-stock-market-highs-and-now-again-in-2020/) First forecasts in late January were mostly stopped out. There were losing signals on the Dow [around 29,300](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/RGkn3RjW-Dow-Jones-Crucial-Support-Levels-in-the-Week-Ahead/) and some in [February at 28,900](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/xWSFpsRi-Selling-Dow-28-900/). Individual stocks shorts done poorly, One exception was the Vanguard dividends index VYM. This did make it's high on the [exact price first posted.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/VYM/BlWd0mFm-Popular-Vanguard-Has-High-Exposure-to-Bad-Market-Conditions/)\n\nIndividual stocks picks done particularly poorly in January. TSLA almost doubled from the first [shorting price of 510.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/TSLA/FOs1PP5d-Tesla-Could-Breakdown-Soon/) Some did a bit better. [Like shorting T at 39.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/T/IUgQyy8k-AT-T-Vulnerable-Debt-Cash-Flow-Leaks/)\n\nLater in February more sell signals were generated as price traded briefly over important resistance levels. If price broke back under these it would suggest market weakness. These were [170 on VTI](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/VTI/IPRCTQh9-VTI-Enters-the-Stubborn-Stage-of-a-Possible-Reversal/) and [29,000 on the Dow.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/LiV4pmmH-Dow-Jones-Crucial-Downside-Break-Possible/) Once these levels were broken the bear market began. In the following days a signal for a [30% drop on the Dow Jones came](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/Cd6Il3np-Next-Series-of-Falls-Can-Take-Dow-Down-10-000-Points/) (and was successful).\n\nIndividual stock picks did much better in February. High prices were signalled in [MSFT](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/MSFT/LWCMh0jH-Microsoft-Setting-Up-For-Hard-Landing/), [BRK](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/BRK.A/bHDf6D7j-Buffet-s-the-King-of-the-Bag-Holders/), [SPCE](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/SPCE/uFAroqOi-SPCE-and-Gravity/), [GOOG](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/GOOG/m56g98mU-Weekly-Bearish-Butterfly-Pattern/). A high on [AMZN was called](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/AMZN/b4DOD5dy-The-Amazon-Bubble/), but price later traded higher. The best signal generated was a buy on the [TVIX from 34 to 800.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/TVIX/ts9VcIlG-TVIX-Long-Term-Trend-Line-Break/)\n\nIn the month of March , 2020, the bubble popped. Most risk based assets and indices crashed over 30%. First analysis post said to [wait for a bounce to sell into](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/nVbfBVXn-Dow-Bounces-Like-a-Brick-While-Making-Big-Breakout/), but this was updated before the market opened to say prices could fall [8% and then 30% in March.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/01/30-dow-jones-drop/) At this point the TradingView account was suspended. Only one account is allowed, and this was set up specifically for a 2020's bear market. So no further posts or updates were made there.\n\nOn the 3rd of March came the first signal to [look for the down move entering somewhere in the 16,000 - 18,000 area](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/16/dow-jones-enters-end-of-denial-stage-and-start-of-the-bull-trap/) on the Dow Jones. Followed by a post on the 16th of March saying [we're entering into the bull trap.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/31/optimism-in-the-air-as-end-of-bull-trap-approaches/) The low on the Dow would be made around 18,250 on the 23rd of March. From here a rally began which has made a current high of 24,500.\n\nApril of 2020 has been the bull trap month. Some losing signals have been generated in the later couple weeks of April. A few calls on the top of the bull trap have been made. Prices have not went substantially higher, they've just not dropped. A forecast on the [17th of April marks the current high](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/16/17th-april-2020-the-bull-trap-completes/), but it looks like price can trade a bit higher. A post on the 19th of April calls for a crash in the S&amp;P500 to [1,600 within the next 5 - 10 weeks](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/19/19th-of-april-here-comes-an-attitude-readjustment/).\n\nToday is the 25th of April. Over the last two weeks forecasts of a big drop starting have been inaccurate. I very strongly suspect this is akin to the sell signals generated in late January and early February. It's the right idea, but it's just the wrong time. A top in the Dow Jones somewhere in the 24,000 - 25,000\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n============\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn advice of kindly internet strangers and the little voice in my head that screams, \"They did not even read what you said, dick\" inside my head; I won't be responding to trolls. \n\nI put forward this information for you to consider if you have an open mind to, and I post daily my ideas and trades based upon this to show real time application of it.",

        "selftext": "It should be well known that FAANGM is dominating the S&amp;P index weight at over 21%.  The combination of this dominance and the insulated nature of their business models have led to a lot of frustration for anyone running TA on the SPX during the recent rally.  With the risk of earnings behind us on big tech, lets take a look at how these bad boys are looking and what the implications are for the broader market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[AMZN Daily](https://preview.redd.it/l59fkfoj7mw41.png?width=1418&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fefb7961f5afa7b1a314e8c8e4427b7b232fc49)\n\nThere was a ton of speculation on AMZN going into earnings, but it is time for this baby to check back to the 2,000 - 2,200 range.  This would be a healthy pull back after the breakout to new highs, but would put a dent in the SPX performance.  MACD crossed over on Friday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[MSFT Daily](https://preview.redd.it/dfztu9s99mw41.png?width=1418&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65341521aa5cf30f6b296b5b8a6c14b95da2fc0e)\n\nMSFT broke its uptrend a couple weeks ago, but hung on as it has an insulated business model and (IMO) if you are an index fund you couldn't afford to miss a breakout on earnings due to the contribution.  With earnings out and MACD waning after the double top at 180, I'm betting on a move back down to the 50 day MA.  Again, a pretty standard check back, but the 7% move down will weigh on the index thanks to the 5.7% weight in the SPY.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[AAPL Daily](https://preview.redd.it/1eqk7rqyamw41.png?width=1418&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eaa9be1af319c90f4db71eb299f92340746721ad)\n\nAAPL, similar to MSFT, broke the uptrend a couple weeks ago, but was bid up into earnings.  With that behind us there is room for a healthy correction back to the 50 day MA at \\~270.  That is a 6.5% move down with an over 5% weight in the SPY.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[SPX Daily](https://preview.redd.it/q759igkjdmw41.png?width=1418&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e70f5bef509a47100dd297c730bebbb35f7568b)\n\nTo tie things together, the rolling over of big tech could drive the S&amp;P down to the 50 day MA of \\~2,740.  If momentum to the downside picks up, we could see \\~2,640.  \n\n**TL/DR:**  Market sentiment has been influenced by big tech, so look for big tech to signal the next leg down.  With earnings out, technicals are turning negative, which removes the positive influence on broader market.  Tech is likely to outperform throughout this recession, but this increases the probability for downside moves on the names that are truly getting bent over.    \n\n**Positions:** SPXS, SPYp 5/15 +270/-260,  XLFp 6/19 +20/-18, ZMp 8/21 +130/-100, XLEp 6/19 35",

        "selftext": "It\u2019s earnings season and with that we\u2019ve seen an influx of earnings related posts. Over the course of my 10 years of investing and trading I\u2019ve learning a few things about trading during earnings season. In this post I\u2019m going to attempt to outline how to approach earnings and profit off of this season. Unlike most of my posts about long-term investing, this will be the rare active trading post. \n\nFor starters, let\u2019s cover the basics of what quarterly earnings are. Publicly traded companies report earnings four times a year, and while most companies follow the calendar year for their fiscal year, some (such as Disney and Microsoft) use a different fiscal year. You may see Q2 earnings in April, or Q1 in October. The important thing to understand is, for the most part, the actual quarter is irrelevant. Prior to an earnings report from being released analysts will use advanced modelling techniques to predict a company\u2019s EPS. Companies are then judged on whether they hit these predictions. The stock price can often fluctuate greatly on whether they hit or missed the consensus prediction.\n\nNow that we understand what earnings are, how do we profit during the volatile earnings season? Let\u2019s outline different strategies and how to implement them\n\n1. The most consistent way to trade around earnings season is the simplest. **Don\u2019t trade!** Earnings season brings additional volatility and often causes emotional trading. Emotional trading can lead to massive losses. Bottom line, if you\u2019re an emotional trader, don\u2019t trade around earnings.\n\n2. The best way to profit during earnings season from my experience is by missing the largest move. In other words, never hold a position, whether it\u2019s a long, short, or options position through earnings. Trade the volatility and hype leading up to earnings and lock in your profits before the report. After the earnings trade the momentum. Don\u2019t be afraid to go long leading up to earnings and shorting after a miss. \n\n3. The final strategy is holding a position through earnings. This is the riskiest option since a miss (if you\u2019re long) or a hit (if you\u2019re short) can cause massive losses. While this is a strategy I rarely implement, you can still be profitable if you approach it in the right way. If you plan to hold through earnings look for companies where the analysts have historically been wrong on earnings. Additionally, look at the individual analyst predictions and remember a hit/miss is based off their consensus. For example, if you have 3 analyst predictions and two predict a 5c EPS and one predicts a -1c EPS the consensus will be 3c EPS, you may be able to conclude that the company is likely to hit since one analyst low balled earnings. You can also read up on how accurate each analyst is and use that knowledge in your trading strategies. This is typically a bit challenging and requires a good amount of digging which is a key reason why I rarely employ this strategy personally.\n\nThese three basic approaches are far from all-encompassing but they cover the basics for newer traders. If you\u2019ve just started trading during the COVID-19 pandemic it\u2019s likely wise to avoid the 3rd option listed above. These are not normal times and volatility is already higher than normal. \n\nGood luck trading around earnings and remember to take your profits and cut your losses quickly.",

Real Estate in smaller / more rural / cheaper areas \n5. At home work stations \n6. Drone delivery (if more people are living in rural areas)\n\nWhat are some ways to capitalize on these trends in the public markets if these are correct?

        "selftext": "Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension Plan made some major changes in its U.S.-traded stock investments in the first quarter, a period marked with volatility from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe pension, one of the largest in the world by assets, initiated a position in Microsoft stock and doubled an investment in Alibaba Group Holding American depositary receipts. Ontario Teachers\u2019 also sold Amazon.com and bought 3M stock. The pension [disclosed the trades, among others, in a form it filed](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/937567/000090342320000041/xslForm13F_X01/infotable.xml?mod=article_inline) with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe provincial pension, which managed $150 billion in net assets at the end of 2019, declined to comment on its stock trades. Ontario Teachers\u2019 is formidable by its size and its execution, having just ended its seventh year of being fully funded. Its funded ratio stood at 103% at the start of 2020, which meant net assets more than covered liabilities. That is an enviable position. A study by The Pew Charitable Trusts using 2017 data showed that the average American state pension had a funded ratio of only 69.1%.\n\nOntario Teachers\u2019 bought 507,493 Microsoft shares in the first quarter. It hadn\u2019t owned any shares of the software giant at the end of 2019.\n\nMicrosoft stock has surged 16.4% in the second quarter through Friday\u2019s close. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 index, a broad measure of the market, has gained 14.3% in the second quarter.\n\nThe company reported strong fiscal-third-quarter earnings at the end of April, and we noted that observers saw strength in Microsoft\u2019s cloud business. Microsoft stock was a popular pick in our latest Big Money Poll .\n\nThe pension bought 219,600 Alibaba ADRs in the quarter to lift its investment to 438,300 ADRs of the Chinese online giant. \n\nAlibaba has gained 2.7% so far in the second quarter. Tension between the U.S. and China continues to overhang the ADRs, but Alibaba continues to build out its cloud business.\n\nOntario Teachers\u2019 sold 53,905 Amazon shares, slashing its investment in the retail and cloud giant to 1,576 shares.\n\nAmazon stock has surged 25.0% for the second quarter to date, benefiting from a rush into so-called stay-at-home stocks . Amazon is also looking beyond merely delivering packages in the coronavirus pandemic. In a recent earnings call, the company said it is developing its own Covid-19 testing capabilities .\n\n3M stock has gained 7.3% so far in the second quarter. The manufacturing giant reported a strong first quarter that was boosted by its health-care and personal-safety-equipment operations. \n\nThe pension bought 90,156 3M shares in the first quarter, lifting its investment to 502,345 shares.\n\nSource: [https://www.barrons.com/articles/huge-pension-bought-microsoft-stock-alibaba-3m-amazon-51589994778](https://www.barrons.com/articles/huge-pension-bought-microsoft-stock-alibaba-3m-amazon-51589994778)",

        "selftext": "I see a lot of posts here about how we\u2019re headed for a lower leg or a higher leg etc, but honestly, no one fucking knows and your sorry ass won\u2019t be able to time it with puts. Even if there\u2019s the next leg down, consider that your timing would need to be impeccable. So instead, consider the following strategies:\nWrite put credits on aapl and msft a month out, with vxx call debits that are due to expire at the same date. The otm vxx call debits would serve as a perfect hedge in case aapl and msft fall. I specifically chose these two tickers because I like both companies, but you can also pick other tech leaders such as fb etc. Basically, do it with a variety of tech stocks that are leading the market. Alternatively, you can just go with qqq put credits hedged with vxx call debits if you only wanna thing about two tickers. \nWrite iron condors on GLD and SLV: this is understated. For instance, between each opex period (historically), SLV on average moves between around 0.7 dollars. That means if you write a condor on SLV on May 18 for June 19 that is 2 point wide from the current price, you\u2019ll have an incredibly likely chance that this trade will go through with you realizing the full profit. \nAs for GLD, write biweekly condors 5 point wide from current price and those typically have an incredible chance of success, especially if you write it in the middle of two opex dates (may 1 for may 15 was when I wrote GLD 166/164, 155.5/153.5). The theta burn on GLD options is best in a two week period. \nAnd finally, another strategy for a hedge is place OTM call debits on TLT for each opex that you write the put credits on. This would be similar to the strategy with vxx. Both sets of strats are perfect, but I personally like vxx more since TLT is prone to mass liquidation events like the one we saw in March.\nSo basically, stop thinking that you\u2019ll be able to time the market with ur retarded technical analysis or looking at volumes on puts. A lot of put volume is just 1-2% of a fund\u2019s money for a multibillion dollar long. The 50 cent trader (ruffer capital) put those trades on to protect their net long assets, which included companies such as Disney. In the end, they just broke even since the vxx options provided a cushion for all the loss in their equities. Most people who consistently make money do it without having to predict market direction.",

        "selftext": "\n\nOkay guys. I will keep it simple. I wrote a post saying $TWLO will moon but got removed. \n\nDon\u2019t worry if you missed $TWLO. Buy call on $OKTA or $NET. The reason is very (extremely) simple: these types of companies are built for the rona situation. I kept hearing people saying $OKTA $TWLO $NET is at ATH. So what? Stocks only ONLY go up. \n\nLook at these companies\u2019 past earnings and think about what these companies are doing during the pandemic. You are restarted if you buy puts on them.\n \nHere is some article explaining why $OKTA is a good play. I hope you have the patience to read all of it because I want you guys to be fucking rich. The article is from seeking alpha but I find it really good. \n\n\u201c\u201d\u201d\nSummary\n\nOkta is a market leader in the much promising sector of identity services.\nThe company was already growing at full speed before the coronavirus pandemic, and it should benefit from accelerating adoption during this period.\nMajor economic and technological trends provide powerful tailwinds for the business in the years ahead.\nThe stock is not too cheap at all, but it is still fairly valued if management keeps executing well.\nI\nOkta (NASDAQ:OKTA) is a high-growth leader in identity services, an area with tremendously promising opportunities for growth. The business was already producing outstanding performance before the coronavirus pandemic appeared on the scenario, and a globally distributed workforce in times of shelter at home policies all over the world is driving accelerating adoption for identity services.\n\nOkta stock is not cheap at all at current prices, but the business is strong enough to grow into its valuation over the next several years.\n\nAn Outstanding Growth Business\nThe company provides identity solutions for the workforce and customers. Workforce identity is the largest and most established segment, and it guarantees that the right employees and contractors will get access to the right networks and data in due time. Customer identity is a relatively new growth area for the company, and Okta is focused on both identity security and providing a seamless experience to the end-user in this business.\n\nOkta is benefiting from major growth tailwinds based on multiple drivers.\n\nDue to the rapid growth of cloud and hybrid IT, identity has become increasingly complex as organizations move to the cloud.\nThe global trend toward digital transformation means that every company is now a technology company, and businesses of all kinds need help at implementing identity solutions that can meet their specific requirements.\nCybersecurity is a major concern nowadays. According to management, more than 70% of hacking-related breaches are caused by stolen credentials, and identity protection is of paramount importance.\nWhen considering the size of the total addressable market, the company believes that it could be as high as $55 billion. Okta is expected to make $771 million in revenue during the fiscal year 2021, so the company is barely scratching the surface in comparison to its long-term growth opportunities.\n\nFinancial performance has been truly outstanding in recent years, with revenue growth reaching 54% annually since 2017. Management comments during the company's investor day on April 1 confirmed that the business keeps firing on all cylinders based on recent data, and several research firms increased their price targets for Okta after the conference.\n\nMost high-growth companies in the sector are losing money due to aggressive reinvestment needs to support long-term growth. Okta, on the other hand, is already generating positive free cash flows, and management has ambitious targets over the middle term.\n\nOkta intends to deliver revenue growth rates in the range of 30% to 35% over the next five years and a free cash flow margin of 20-25% in fiscal 2024. These targets are not easy to achieve, but they are not unrealistic either when considering the company's track record and future opportunities.\n\nTotal revenue was last quarter reached $167.3 million, an increase of 45% year over year. Subscription revenue was $158.5 million, an increase of 46%. Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) reached $1.21 billion, growing by 66% year over year.\n\n\nLooking at the long-term trajectory of both customer count and retention rates, the numbers are more than healthy. Okta is consistently gaining new customers while also making more revenue per customer, with the net dollar retention rate in the neighborhood of 120% over the past several years.\n\n\nIt can be difficult for an outside investor who is not an industry expert to assess the technological strength of a company such as Okta. However, the fact that customers keep spending more money on the company's solution is clearly a positive reflection in this area.\n\nLooking at other sources of information, Gartner recognizes Okta as a market leader in its main market.\n\nThe company still has a long way to go until reaching its profitability targets, but Okta has been steadily and consistently making progress in terms of profitability over time, so the business is clearly moving in the right direction.\n\nOkta has a relatively short history as a public company, but it is worth noting that the company has exceeded revenue and earnings estimates in each quarter since going public. This is indicating that management tends to provide modest guidance and to overdeliver over time, which is encouraging in terms of assessing Okta's ability to meet its targets going forward.\n\n\nRisk and Reward\nOkta is a market leader in an area with plenty of opportunities for growth in the years ahead. The company is firing on all cylinders and generating positive free cash flow, and there is a good chance that revenue growth will continue being strong while profit margins expand in the next 5 years. Vigorous top-line growth, in combination with expanding profit margins, will provide a double boost to earnings and cash flows.\n\nCompetition is always an important risk factor to watch, especially from large players with deep pockets such as IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). These companies have a wide reach among large corporations all over the world, and they also have solid reputations for reliability.\n\nHowever, Okta is a specialized player with the first-mover advantage in top quality identity services, and it benefits from remarkably high customer switching costs. Companies that are relying on Okta for their identity services would be very reluctant to change to another provider due to the risks and difficulties that this transition would potentially carry.\n\nBesides, having a large customer base also means more usage data for Okta, and this data is enormously valuable when it comes to permanently improving the quality of the company's services. Considering the company's competitive strength and world-class technologies, it is not unreasonable to say that a big technology company such as Microsoft could be more interested in buying Okta than trying to compete aggressively in Okta's main areas of strength.\n\nThe biggest drawback is arguably valuation, since Okta is trading at a price to sales ratio above 30. The company is one of the most promising businesses in the industry, but this quality is also acknowledged by the market and incorporated into the stock price.\n\nOkta can grow into its valuation over time, and there is a good chance that the stock will deliver double-digit returns over the long term from current price levels. But, still, the stock is fairly priced as opposed to undervalued at around $150 per share.\n\n\nI am not against buying Okta at these prices, because the company has enough strength to outperform expectations in the future. After all, the best growth opportunities are seldom available at cheap valuations, and these kinds of companies can many times sustain rapid growth for longer periods than what the market is giving them credit for. The bar is set quite high for Okta, but the company does not lack the capability to overdeliver.\n\nHowever, it is a more conservative assumption to estimate that revenue growth will be around 30% per year in the next five years, which would mean that the stock is fairly valued right now.\n\nFor those looking to start building a position in Okta at current prices, it makes sense to start doing it slowly. Perhaps buying one-third of your intended position at these prices and waiting for a better entry price over the middle term with the other two-thirds of the position.\n\nOne thing looks quite clear, though, Okta is a high-quality growth stock, and any pullback down the road could represent a remarkably attractive buying opportunity.\n\u201c\u201d\u201d\n\nEdit: I got fucked up buying $NAT calls but $TWLO saved me. I currently have no position on $OKTA as the earning date is 05/28. I will update my position a week before the earning.",

        "selftext": "\\## **My history investing in college and my first month investing in February:**\n\nLearned about miners and blockchain validation with a chemical engineering friend before the rally.\n\n\\- Bought **XRP** at $.15 and $.25, sold at $3.28 (I valued at $4 or $5 dollars MAX in 10 years if blockchain found adoption)\n\n\\- Bought **AMD** after the rally at $11 because it was ridiculous how much cost efficiency they had introduced to the market to poor people like me unlike **NVIDIA** products which always seemed far removed and discouraged me.\n\n\\- I started with **Panasonic** because I had missed out on the window to invest in **Tesla** at 200-300 range. I believed **Panasonic** to be similar to **AMD's** relationship to **bitcoin**; while all eyes looked at the shiny object, I looked at the boring parts that built it.\n\n\\- The market crashed, so I DCA'd aggressively and controlled my emotions through out. I was more concerned with my performance to commitment rather than my returns at the time. I did well.\n\n\\- My investments in March 19 was **SQ** and **Lyft**\n\n\\## **My Strategy now that I have income**\n\n\\- I bought up to 5,000 dollars in stocks ranging from **FANUC** (industrial robotics) to **DENNYS** (logistics/real estate)\n\n\\- I trimmed down to $2,300 but will rapidly rebuild with a different approach:\n\n\\- I'm buying 1 stock in the company before making any further developments with. Following this, I will purchase ETFs in sectors that I **want** to see develop in the next 5-15 years. I will buy 1 stake into these ETFs and combine it with my 1 stock purchase to create the necessary offset.\n\n\\- For example, I bought 1 stock of **Texas Instruments**  for $109 followed by a purchase in **SOXX ETF** for semiconductors, which has the largest ETF allocation to **Texas Instruments.** I will apply similar logic to companies like **Facebook, Paypal,** etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I do this \"1 chip\" start in multiple industries because I want to pick some arbitrary point in time but I have a lot of industries &amp; ecosystems that I would like to reasonably participate in. This will still cost a lot of money to start off with and buys me time to study company numbers and outlooks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\## **My current market sentiment**\n\n**-** I consider where you start on a graph as somewhat arbitrary and see the current market stability as somewhat of an exercise in game theory and rowing a boat throat a thick fog. I believe it's optimal to row cautiously forward and to not stay still. With cautious rowing, you'll be able to react appropriately if you are suddenly met by a waterfall or a path with clearer vision.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I am **\\`*****BEARISH\\`*** on Amazon in the long term. I believe that slowly, but surely, the market will consume Amazon's hold on its markets. I don't believe Amazon will maintain the status quo on cloud computing due to the quality of its competitors. I absolutely LOVE **Google Cloud Platform** and utilize **Firebase real-time database** very often. **Microsoft** has made some extremely important acquisitions recently in **Github and NPM - that's enormous.**\n\n\\-  I have suspicions about **Amazon** will struggle internationally. I don't know if Amazon will penetrate China the way China does, or if it will succeed in locations south of Mexico against things like **Mercado Libre**\n\n\\- I have suspicions that tech platforms will soon integrate in a meaningful way with financials. As in, the virtualization of stores and forwarded payments in places like the **Facebook(Visa) Market Place, Twitter(Square) payment sending, Paypal(honey) &amp; Amazon purchasing, Gaming credits, etc.**\n\n**-** I am \\`**bullish**\\` on Facebook. Facebook is utterly invaluable and scales globally. The reason it's adopted in **Mexico**, for example, is because it's cheaper and faster than other services. They also service millions of developers with **React** and its growing development ecosystem. They provide a standardized marketting platform for small businesses on Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, and soon to be JIO. I would not be surprised if they soon enter the fintech sector.\n\n\\- I am \\`**bullish\\`** on **Paypal**. They are seemingly repeating their previous success by servicing large online commerce that are upgrading their systems. **Honey/Paypal** will scrape coupons for Amazon and force organizations like Visa to compete with  **real-time financial services**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I am **\\`bullish\\`** on cloud software and networking. I think **CDNs** and dedicated **services for Cybersecurity** will maintain. Sure Google provides these services but things like **Cloudflare** and **Fastly** have dedicated solutions to fast image processing, DDoS protection, and more that other platforms may not be able to **allocate their resources to**. **Cloudflare** has an enormous network, and **Fastly** provides a great system for you to enjoy content like **Reddit.** I think it's hard to miss the mark here - the highway of the internet is going to get faster and more assets will be maintained in the server's space - the ecosystem must grow with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I am ***\\`EXTREMELY BEARISH***\\*\\*\\`\\*\\* on Beyond Meat. I've been vegetarian for 10 years. IT'S BAD. WE HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO BE EXCITED ABOUT AND WE'RE NOT USED TO HAVING ATTENTION. VEGETARIANS ARE LYING IF THEY SAY IT'S AMAZING. ***IT'S LITERALLY DOG FOOD***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I am \\`**BULLISH\\`** on the long term development of **Mexico**. I think companies like **Kansas City Southern** that services **Mexican-American** relationships will grow well in the long run.\n\n\\- I am **\\`BULLISH\\`**  on Apple and Adobe. Amazing products.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\## **CURRENT HOLDINGS (ordered by priority &amp; checkup time):**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**GOOG &amp; AMZN exposure through tech ETFs** ::: priority FB\n\n**NVIDIA, AMD, Intel EXPOSURE through semiconductor ETFS** ::: priority Texas Instruments\n\n**Environmental Services exposure through Sanitation ETFS** ::: priority Waste Management\n\n**Adobe and AutoDesk exposure through cloud software ETFs** :: priority Adobe\n\n**Nintendo exposure through gaming ETFS ::** priority Nintendo\n\n**Cisco exposure through cloud networking and edge computing ETFS** Cicsco, Fastly, Cloudflare, etc\n\n**TELECOM networking ETFS** :: priority TMobile\n\n**Manufacturing technology, industrial sectors, and robotics exposure to**  Fanuc, ABB, Siemens, Sherwin-Williams, VW, GM, Nissan, Toyota, Panasonic,\n\n**Healthcare services ETF** :: priority Cigna\n\n**FB -- LONG**\n\n**PAYPAL --  LONG**\n\n**TEXAS INSTRUMENTS - LONG**\n\n**MSFT     --  LONG**\n\n**APPLE   --  LONG**\n\n**ADOBE -- LONG**\n\n**DISNEY -  LONG**\n\n**BITCOIN - LONG**\n\n**TMOBILE - 2 YEARS**\n\n**VISA -- 2 YEARS**\n\n**JPM - 2 YEARS**\n\n**TWITTER - 2 YEARS**\n\n**SQUARE - 1 YEAR**\n\n**LYFT - 1 YEAR**\n\n**FASTLY - QUARTERLY**\n\n**CLOUDFLARE - QUARTERLY**\n\n**1LIFE MEDICAL - QUARTERLY**\n\n**FIVERR - QUARTERLY**\n\n**DRAFT KING - QUARTERLY YEAR + CHICAGO POLITICS**\n\n**GROUPON - SPARE CHANGE JAR**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**## EXCITED TO ACQUIRE**\n\n**- ADOBE**\n\n\\- **QQQ**\n\n\\- **SHERWIN WILLIAMS**\n\n\\- **TOYOTA**\n\n\\- **KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN**\n\n\\-",

        "selftext": "Every once in a while you will come across a stock that very few people seem to talk about, for whatever reason that might be. Below I will talk about 3 companies that I feel like are underrated and deserve some consideration by investors. Of course always do your own research on all companies and don't buy these because I wrote about them, I am just a random guy on the internet.\n\nFirst company:\nOpenText (OTEX)\nMarket cap: 10,76 billion\nCurrent share price: 55.64 CAD\nYear high: 63.28 CAD\nForeward PE: 12.63\nTotal cash: 1.45 bilion\nTotal debt: 4.47 billion\nEstimated growth next year: 16.70%\nEstimated sales growth: 8:00%\n\nA Canadian softwate company that is the leader in Enterprise Information Management (EIM), which means they help companies work more efficiently on things like the cloud and within their own systems. Their 2019 1.42 billion doller acquisition of Boston based software company Carbonite, who focused mainly on providing software backups and data protection, also gives them more strings to their bow in the ever growing cloud industry.\n\nThey have around 684 companies that use their software, some of the biggest companies are: Aegon, BMW, British American Tobacco, T-Mobile, Fox, Michelin, Qualcomm, Rio Tinto and Unilever. With more and more companies placing emphasis on online work and the importance of the cloud, OpenText is well situated to profit from these trend in the coming decade.\n\nSecond company:\nTakeTwo Entertainment (TTWO)\nMarket cap: 15.95 billion\nCurrent share price: 140.51 USD\nYear high: 140.51 USD\nForeward PE: 32.38\nTotal cash: 2 billion\nTotal debt: 177.25 million\nEstimated growth next year: -7.90% but with a 5 year estimate of 11.88% per annum\nEstimated sales growth: -5.10%\n\u00a0\nOne of the largest video game companies in the world and holder of titles like GTA, Red Dead Redemption, Bioshock, Borderlands, Civilization and NBA2K. These blockbuster gaming franchises make them the producers of the most popular video games in several of the gaming genres. They also recently signed a deal with the NBA to extend their popular 2K series, which also grants them the rights to the ever growing popularity of e-sports focused on NBA2K.\n\nIn the recent year they have also shifted their focus more towards the mobile gaming industry, an industry responsible for 60% of the global video game market in 2019 and forecast to grow much more in the coming years. With the video game market as a whole growing and more and more people using their spare time to play video games, TakeTwo is well positioned for the future growth that comes with the industry, especially as games get more realistic and virtual reality starts playing a big role in these games.\n\nThird company:\nBlackberry (BB)\nMarket cap: 2.54 billion\nCurrent share price: 4.54 USD\nYear high: 8.96 USD\nForeward PE: 28.38\nTotal cash: 909 million\nTotal debt: 758 million\nEstimated growth next year: 166.70%\nEstimated sales growth: 10.70%\n\nLast but not least, the company that everyone still associates with their popular cellphones in the 2010's. Blackberry has fallen a long way since then, but they have since shifted their focus to software rather than hardware. Since CEO John Chen took over at the helm in 2013, he has drastically changed the future outlook of this company. Blackberry is now mainly focused on cyber security, with their QNX embedded systems software platform being their main flagship for future growth. The QNX platform is used to secure and aid self driving car systems. This platform has helped them land a collaboration deal with Amazon Web Services to produce save self driving cars. It doesn't stop there however, as they also have deals to provide security software for Microsoft, Audi, BMW, Ford, GM and the US government.\n\nIt certainly doesn't help that most people still think Blackberry is focused on producing cellphones and I have even heard people asking if they still exist as a company, but they most certainly do and I would argue they are ready for a shot to reclaim their 2010 glory days as a cyber security company instead of a hardware one.\n\n\nIf you have any stocks that you feel like are underrated or you have a different view on the ones I wrote about, feel free to let me know.\n\nTLDR:\nOpenText, TakeTwo Entertainment and Blackberry are well positioned for growth in the coming decade with a stronger emphasis on the integration of technology into every aspect of our daily personal and working lives.",

        "selftext": "We can all agree that the conference call was a disappointment. Well, this is how I would have handled the MVIS call if I were the CEO of MVIS. \n\nCall starts, epic rock music starts playing instead of the gay piano music of the real call. This gets people hyped up and automatically raises the stock price by 20 or 30 cents. \n\nA really hot lady gets on and says in a sexy voice, thank you MVIS stockholders for attending our conference call, we will begin shortly. Now moaning sex noises are added to the rock music as the announcer starts making out with her hot assistant live on air.\n\nRock music fades into guitar solo and finally an explosion. Then the CEO of MVIS (me) takes the mic and says \"Good evening investors old and new, we have some VERY SPECIAL news for you today... and a very special guest\" - shares gap up, people start buying like crazy. \n\nI then hand the mic to my special guest. \"Yes indeed we do\", he says in an oddly familiar voice.\n\nIt takes shareholders mere seconds to realize that this is the voice of none other than Bill Gates the founder and former CEO of Microsoft, during which time stock price has already cleared $2. \n\n\"At this point we would like to announce a merger of MVIS and Microsoft\" says Bill Gates, \"and we will be purchasing the technology of MVIS to use in our Hololens for... 1 Billion Dollars\".\n\nAt this point the shares are trading well north of the $5 mark. \"But there's more\" Gates continues. \"We will be folding the entirety of MSFT common stock into MVIS shares ASAP to reflect this merger\" \n\nimmediately in exchanges across the world MSFT stops trading and is replaced with none other than MVIS at an initial stock offering of $300 a share. All across the world those intelligent enough to have invested in MVIS celebrate as newly minted millionaires. \n\nI take the mic back from Bill. \"Thanks Bill\" I say. \"But there's more. We have just come out with a vaccine for the Coronavirus.\" Insantly trading of MVIS shares halts because of the insane amount of people buying it crashing the exchange and hitting all the circuit breakers. \n\nSuddenly a helicopter noise is heard in the background growing louder and louder. \"Uhhh, what's happening?\" I say and even Bill looks confused. However, as the Helicopter lands, who emerges from inside it but Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon...\n\nHe snatches the mic from Bill and says, \"I would like to announce that I Jeff Bezos CEO of Amazon have just taken up a 50% stake in MVIS and UAVS.\" \n\nUAVS moons.\n\nFinally we all crack open a Beer live on the call and talk about our favorite penny stocks and have investors call in to ask questions, or even just to shoot the shit with us. A hologram of Warren Buffet appears using MVIS technology to congratulate us on our wise investments. Everyone makes a profit, even people that didn't buy MVIS as the poor all around the world are assigned 1 share of MVIS each (which is worth well over $10,000 at this point) as an economic stimulus, saving the global economy.",

        "selftext": "My brother-in-law, who is a senior position at Microvision, has shared with me very clear and definite news. This is highly classified information between the two companies , Microvision and Microsoft. Due to strict confidential regulations, I am not at liberty to discuss the specifics, but all I can say is that on Tuesday bagholders will celebrate and see the price beyond what they had imagined. The only reason why a buyout has been delayed is due to price negotiations between the two companies and they have finally agreed upon a price after a lengthy process. The deal is sealed and will be announced on Tuesday, May 19. This is based on concrete evidence, not rumors as I see many of you base your investments on in this forum. Up until now, both companies have been rather cryptic with respect to any buyout or merger news so that the stock price remains low for the whales. If you think that the price for $mvis will only go up to $3, you are making a huge underestimation. The bears and shorts will be utterly destroyed and face the ultimate regret on Tuesday.\u00a0 As an investor, I have already invested in 300k shares at sub $0.60. I will continue to purchase an additional 100k shares before Tuesday. I highly recommend all people to take this opportunity and invest as much as you're able to while the price is under a dollar. For those who are holding on to this, the time has almost come. Do not sell! $3 is nowhere near close to what $mvis will be on Tuesday..think double digits $10 and up , guaranteed. For those who have not purchased enough, now is your last opportunity to purchase some on Monday before the rocket takes off. I am going to pull an Elon Musk here and speak hypothetically\u00a0 to avoid legal issues and securities fraud so I hope you catch my drift : Imo, based on data I received from a close source at Microvision,\u00a0 $mvis stock price will be at $12 a share. Monday will be the last chance to buy this very lucrative stock. As the great Warren Buffet has mentioned , \"\u00a0 To all the people who become millionaires and multimillionaires on Tuesday, you owe me 10% in dividends of your profit. Salute.",

        "selftext": "This is a strategy that has limited risk, and decent profit potential considering the length of holding the position (generally 2-3 days).\n\nThe layout is a long strangle/straddle expiring the next week and a short strangle expiring in the current week at a 3:2 ratio. For example, here is an MSFT trade I just entered.\n\nMSFT Price at Entry: 178.90\n\nBuy 3 177.5 P (6/5 Exp)\n\nBuy 3 180 C (6/5)\n\nSell 2 175 P (5/29)\n\nSell 2 182.5 P (5/29)\n\nPrice of 3 Long Strangles: 2.65 + 2.99 X 3 = 16.92\n\nPrice of 2 Short Strangles: .51 + .58 X 2 = 2.18\n\nEntry Price: 1474$\n\nThe short credit covers 218$ of theta decay in the long strangle if the stock doesn't move, or around 13%. In cases where the stock price doesn't move, the play can still be a winner and is usually a small loser (~3-5%) unless there is also an accompanying volatility drop which can make it a medium loser (10-15% generally).\n\nBecause longs are in a higher number to shorts, there is still unlimited profit potential to the upside or downside.\n\nRun this through a profit loss calculator or an analysis tool and see if you like what you see. This has become one of my go-to plays.\n\nA few rules:\n\nDon't make this play around earnings. When earnings come into play, IV becomes inverted (back week has higher IV than front week) so moves in the stock price affect the short strangle more than the long strangle/straddle, which can make the play a big loser. If you want to run a hedged straddle/strangle around earnings, the long must be in at least a 5:2 ratio to the short, sometimes up to 4:1.\n\nGenerally don't open on days when there has been a big spike in VIX, as this increases the entry price of the position and leaves you vulnerable to volatility drops.\n\nYou can use a 2:1 ratio if you want more upside for a stock price move, but this leaves you more vulnerable if the stock price doesn't move.\n\nYou can also use a 1:1 ratio provided you can find a setup where the wing widths are wide enough and you can still get a required amount of short credit. However, the rules for 1:1 ratios are a bit more complex. I will make another post in a few days detailing the rules for this.\n\nThis strategy performs well when VIX is elevated (25+). I have not used this strategy in regular market conditions, but I think it would still work, although short credits would be smaller. The ratio may need tinkering in normal market conditions.\n\nGain Target: ~10%. These plays can easily produce 20-30% gains as well; however, when you are in this gain range the play becomes more directional so you need to be weary of price reversals.\n\nEntry date: I usually look to enter on Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday.  Length of hold can be longer but make sure you get a higher percentage of short credit as there will be more theta decay in your long.\n\nExit date: Anytime between Thursday EOD and Midday Friday.\n\nAlways buy back short puts and calls if they go to 0.05 or under.\n\nTry to use highly liquid stocks (AMD, INTC, MSFT) that also move a decent bit.\n\nThat's all I can think of for now. Lmk if there are any questions.\n\nI'll be making more posts like this in my community /r/hedgedoptiontrading",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m coming at you with another hot pick. In my last DDs, I gave y\u2019all New Relic and Activision as two picks that would give huge returns. I think the potential Box Inc. shows for gaining upward momentum is even greater than the previous two. Below I will make the case for why Box is a good investment.\n\n**What Do They Do?**\n\nBox Inc. is a cloud content management and file sharing service for businesses. It was founded in 2005 and is supported on various platforms like Windows, macOs, and mobile.\n\n**Box Competitors**\n\nThe main competitors for Box are Dropbox, Google, and Microsoft. The downside risk from Box stems from the fact that Google and Microsoft are willing to deliver the services Dropbox and Box offer for very cheap, which makes the landscape a bit challenging. However, that said, Box Inc. is uniquely positioned to be an enterprise play while its most similar counterpart Dropbox is mostly for individual consumers.\n\n**Why Box Inc. is a Good Play Right Now?**\n\nBox Inc. is an excellent play right now because it has been struggling these past few years to show sustained growth in revenues. However, the pandemic has become the catalyst that Box needed to accelerate the company to its next stages. Below you can see my reasons:\n\n1. Dropbox has seen large growth by users in the business space. However, Box is truly the enterprise play as I mentioned earlier and to me the continued growth as seen in Dropbox\u2019s last earnings call (18% y/y) is promising for Box as well. I am simply convinced Dropbox and Box are in a space that is growing a ton. The biggest takeaway I took from Dropbox\u2019s most recent earnings report is that Dropbox Business Team was the fastest growing part of their business starting from March, the beginning of quarantine, with a 40% increase in Business Team trials [www.blog.dropbox.com/topics/company/dropbox-by-the-numbers-in-q1-and-early-q2](http://www.blog.dropbox.com/topics/company/dropbox-by-the-numbers-in-q1-and-early-q2). I can\u2019t even imagine or even accurately guess what the enterprise solution for cloud file system management Box is posting in growth if Dropbox, the consumer play, is posting those numbers. That Dropbox link I posted above is definitely worth a read especially considering Box has all these same integrations that Dropbox has plus more, which is an additional thing that makes it an even more attractive investment. You can see some of Box\u2019s integrations here: [https://www.box.com/partners?utm\\_source=Google&amp;utm\\_medium=SEM&amp;utm\\_campaign=DM-Google-SEM-NA-ENG-Brand&amp;utm\\_keyword=box%20integrations&amp;id=7010e000001PaCy&amp;utm\\_content=217155712240|kwd-332756340892|c&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwnv71BRCOARIsAIkxW9HKhQ-3qQCL9J1xUCNYI51JIpRRs1lqkw8tQiF\\_5CUtnPmyyy27\\_q0aAg-kEALw\\_wcB](https://www.box.com/partners?utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=SEM&amp;utm_campaign=DM-Google-SEM-NA-ENG-Brand&amp;utm_keyword=box%20integrations&amp;id=7010e000001PaCy&amp;utm_content=217155712240|kwd-332756340892|c&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwnv71BRCOARIsAIkxW9HKhQ-3qQCL9J1xUCNYI51JIpRRs1lqkw8tQiF_5CUtnPmyyy27_q0aAg-kEALw_wcB).\n2. Box supports 68% of Fortune 500 companies ([www.box.com/customers](http://www.box.com/customers)) which you can find straight off their website. This is important to note because Box charges businesses per user per month unless it\u2019s a massive account as you can find here: [www.box.com/pricing](http://www.box.com/pricing). As more companies continue letting their employees work from home and get them on-boarded on their remote infrastructure, Box will gain users with their existing customers, people who previously were not given Box access. On top of that, Box will gain more company sign-ups as remote work becomes more prevalent, and I think the next earnings report will start to show the full picture of the favorable positioning Box has gained.\n3. It\u2019s hard to leave the Box ecosystem. This is important because it mitigates risk of company\u2019s leaving Box for a cheaper competitor. Autists doubted my vibes when I said New Relic was going to kill it, but contrary to popular belief, changing technologies and services isn\u2019t something that just happens overnight. It\u2019s a gradual process and one that Box has made very difficult since their platform has so many custom add-ons and is tailored to specific companies.\n4. Box is seen as the secure solution by many companies. I know for a fact that the talent at Box is incredible, and the product they have is also equally great. Security is very valuable, and companies are willing to pay premiums to make sure the information that they are sharing over the cloud will not be leaked or exposed. Box even has products within the ecosystem that can make things more secure such as Box Shield, which helps prevent data leaks by allowing admins to add security controls to content. On a side note, the plugins Box has continued adding to their ecosystem has created a great opportunity for additional revenue.\n5. Box is one of the companies that immediately benefits from remote work and will have lasting gains from the new economy. But even better, Box is also a part of the tools that make collaboration possible for teams and in immediate demand now like Zoom and Slack. I think it is possible that people will not notice Box\u2019s potential until an earnings call or two once their growth rate is outpacing the conservative one management had previously outlined in Q4 earnings (11% revenue growth).\n\n**Acquisition Target?**\n\nI\u2019m going to make a case for getting long calls here. Simply, I can see a world where Box is acquired by Microsoft. Right now, Box is a growing company that has learned to monetize an industry that Microsoft has continuously shown interest in penetrating. A Microsoft and Box pairing would be super successful but also means Microsoft would probably pay a premium to acquire Box as well. What makes this an even bigger possibility in my opinion is activist investor Starboard Value taking three Box board seats ([https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/23/activist-investor-starboard-value-taking-three-box-board-seats-as-involvement-deepens/](https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/23/activist-investor-starboard-value-taking-three-box-board-seats-as-involvement-deepens/)). Starboard is on the Board of Box to help raise the stock price, and as of right now, it seems like it is a collaborative effort between management and Starboard rather than throwing out leadership or doing a complete takeover, something activists are usually more well known for doing.\n\nMicrosoft can make that sad balance sheet Box has and help the business scale to a healthier state that would give Dropbox and Google a run for their money. In addition, Box already integrates with Office 365, so in my opinion, this is a pretty painless integration into the Microsoft ecosystem of products. To be clear, this is one of the things I have considered and is probably overly optimistic. Nonetheless, the pandemic is still giving Box incredible growth and that should remain as the main driving factor for investing.\n\n**Financials**\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to dig in here, but I think the elephant in the room is the massive amount of debt Box carries. However, I\u2019m not too concerned as management has addressed ways to reduce this which you can reference their last earnings call, and I believe management is more focused on solidifying their place as the enterprise leader in this industry. Basically, this business was built to reduce debt and COGS a ton as its revenues scale.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI cannot see a scenario where Box loses, and I see them as a long-term winner. Long calls are safe to avoid any catastrophe the broader market brings and even better because Box contracts are cheap. The key here is buying at the right time and let earnings sink in for folks so they realize the massive potential box has.\n\ntldr: Long calls on Box to make the ultimate gains.\n\nBox 09/18/20 $20C\n\nBox 01/15/21 $25C\n\nPD 11/20/20 $30C",

        "selftext": "I am a web developer with cloud certifications in Google Cloud Platform and AWS. I have a long position in VMW.\n\n**TLDR: VMW June 19 150C**\n\nVMWare's earnings are May 28, which leaves some decent runway left to play the IV increase leading into earnings, but you don't want anything expiring too close to earnings, since theta will steal your premium. Expiring wwo weeks after earnings is usually a fine distance that protects gains, but you probably want to consider selling the day (or two) before earnings if we  had already run up to 150 quickly.\n\nSo, onto the actual DD. First, from a personal standpoint, as a cloud developer, there is no cloud without virtual machines, as they are an essential component to scalable architecture (and building your application to scale with user growth is basically the original point of cloud based technology). And without VMWare, the landscape of potential VM options significantly diminishes.\n\nIf the cloud is the gold mine, VMWare are selling the very best virtualized shovels. Shit, they can just spin up new shovels at a keystroke.\n\nVMWare is at the core of any sound cloud strategy, and Google has recently announced their fully-managed VMware Cloud Foundation stack on dedicated Google infrastructure:\n\n[https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-announces-new-integrated-first-party-offering-with-vmware/](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-announces-new-integrated-first-party-offering-with-vmware/)\n\nAlso, VMWare's relevance in the context of COVID-19, and partnerships with Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are highlighted in this recent Business Insider article, which is pay-to-read, so I've copied it here, since I'm no elitist:\n\n[https://www.businessinsider.com/vmwares-coo-the-indispensable-bridge-in-the-cloud-2020-5](https://www.businessinsider.com/vmwares-coo-the-indispensable-bridge-in-the-cloud-2020-5)\n\n&gt;VMware Chief Operating Officer Sanjay Poonen said the alliances it forged with cloud giants like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have transformed the company into an \"indispensable bridge.\" VMware's virtualization technology has become a critical tool in the cloud as businesses set up networks on multiple platforms and in their own data centers. \"If you look at the last two to three years, we're the only company where the six public-cloud-infrastructure leaders have all embraced VMware,\" Poonen told Business Insider. \"Nobody else has that position of being the indispensable bridge from the private cloud to the public cloud.\"\n&gt;\n&gt;The earnings reports from several tech giants \u2014 Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, and Google \u2014 are in, and they underscore a key trend: The cloud is hot.\n&gt;\n&gt;VMware Chief Operating Officer Sanjay Poonen, who has been keeping track of the reports, said he noted another common theme in these cloud giants' success.\n&gt;\n&gt;\"They've all embraced us,\" he told Business Insider last week. \"Some percentage of those companies' revenue growth will come from VMware helping customers.\"\n&gt;\n&gt;How did all the big cloud companies become VMware allies?\n&gt;\n&gt;The Dell Technologies subsidiary blazed the trail for virtualization, a technology that enables businesses to access disparate computer systems as one network. Virtualization has become even more critical in the cloud because it allows businesses to set up networks on web-based platforms and scale down \u2014 or even abandon \u2014 private data centers.\n&gt;\n&gt;A new trend called \"hybrid cloud,\" where businesses use multiple cloud platforms and in-house data centers, has made VMware even more popular, since its software makes it possible to manage data and applications across platforms. As a result, all the major cloud players (including China's Alibaba) have sought out an alliance with VMware.\n&gt;\n&gt;\"If you look at the last two to three years, we're the only company the six public-cloud-infrastructure leaders have all embraced,\" Poonen said. \"Nobody else has that position of being the indispensable bridge from the private cloud to the public cloud. We view Amazon, Azure, Google as our friends. We've worked really hard the last three years to build pristine partnerships with all of them.\"\n&gt;\n&gt;Some of VMware's friendships have even risen eyebrows. The most prominent example is Oracle: The two companies had long been rivals, with Oracle refusing to support VMware's software for years \u2014 until it announced an unexpected new alliance last year. VMware Chief Information Officer Bask Iyer told Business Insider at the time that he was \"very pleasantly surprised\" by Oracle's decision to form a partnership.\n&gt;\n&gt;The COVID-19 crisis has led to a faster acceleration of the cloud as businesses scramble to adapt to the sudden pivot to remote work. VMware is well-positioned to benefit because of the alliances it forged in the past few years, according to Poonen: \"The notion of VMware being at the center of the cloud for the enterprise is only going to get more and more pronounced,\" he said.\n\n**TLDR: VMW June 19 150C**\n\nSecure those virtualized tendies.",

        "selftext": "The saying, \"The stock market predicts the future\" is older than most of us, yet most discard it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\u201cI always believe that **prices move** first and **fundamentals** come second.\u201d\n\n\\~ Paul Tudor Jones\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can prove to **any thinking person** that extreme price moves can be forecast (within a *reasonable* margin of error) by understanding price patterns. All I need you to do is to suspend disbelief for long enough to consider the facts of the matter.  To engage in civil disagreement and to be receptive to evidence and testing.  I used to think this was not much to ask, March taught me better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've learned those who pretend to be asleep can not be awakened, so at this point I am only talking to those of you who can understand the difference between rational and radical. Sceptical and cynical.   **I'm speaking to the rational sceptics.** The people too  smart to believe what  I say, and not dumb enough to not bother to check if I might just be right.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know that most big price moves in the market can be seen before they happen, and that when they happen there will  usually be news that is synchronised along with it. From a casual perspective, the news moves the market; but the move can be seen setting up before the news happens. It is in the charts first, and then it is in the news  later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Listen, I get it!\n\n# I know that sounds dumb.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI absolutely, fully, understand that saying that is just like saying there is an  elephant in the tree. Right away your mind comes up with all the reasons an  elephant can not be in the tree. I GET THAT.  Be sceptical. Doubt what is doubtful,  do not refuse to look.  If you refuse to look, this is ignorance disguised as scepticism. If you can be shown, I can show you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt doesn't \"Make sense\", but it does happen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Classic Template of a Bubble\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBubbles have always formed in extremely similar ways and anyone who understood how a bubble template worked and remained focused on executing trade plans based upon  that template would have always made a fortune. **This is a fact.** You can dispute if this will  happen again, but upon  full examination of the evidence it is indisputable it was the case for all  previous crashes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\"People forecasting market crashes are always wrong!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe the boy who cries wolf has better eye sight.  To see something coming and to time the trades of that thing are really quite different. Picking a top is very hard because no matter what form of analysis you use there will be multiple false signals thrown out.  From all forms of analysis I know of, typically about 3 - 5 false signals come before the real trade.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3 - 5 failed attempts is plenty to lure folks into thinking Cassandras of Wall Street should be mocked without due consideration, but rarely do any of these signals produce sells levels more than 20% off the mark.  The trouble is, in a bull market if you call a bear people will laugh at you for being wrong each time the market goes up 0.05%. Which is why I say a *reasonable* margin or error is required.\n\nFor example, in  late February I said if the Dow breaks under 29,000  [it could start to crash](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/LiV4pmmH-Dow-Jones-Crucial-Downside-Break-Possible/).   That happened, but there are people here who seen me posting daily warning them this was coming (on other platforms) who'll say  my forecasts do not matter because [I was wrong in January.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/RGkn3RjW-Dow-Jones-Crucial-Support-Levels-in-the-Week-Ahead/)  The market went up 600 points and down 10,000.  Here I learned only aim things at reasonable people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got this market top (and it went really well for me). I did not get it first time. I had some small  stop outs (as I do in ANY trade), but I did nail it.  I've posts from January [saying I was looking for it.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/SPX/KY1p7aZa-50-Years-Could-End-in-Tears-for-US-Indices/)   Posts in February calling [both the  high and low of the move.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/Cd6Il3np-Next-Series-of-Falls-Can-Take-Dow-Down-10-000-Points/)   I've shown how I used patterns from  the previous crashes over the [last 100 years to forecast this.](https://www.reddit.com/user/2020sbear/comments/fwo5ut/it_shouldnt_work_but_over_the_last_100_years_this/)   I forecast [the low in  March](https://imgur.com/a/5bNi7vz), then the [move through April](https://imgur.com/a/WX5kwCP) (Full post for [previous links](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/16/dow-jones-enters-end-of-denial-stage-and-start-of-the-bull-trap/)) and then to watch for good news transfer over to [bad news around 25,000 Dow](https://imgur.com/a/OUy2dTM) ([Full  post](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/31/optimism-in-the-air-as-end-of-bull-trap-approaches/))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've done all of this during times when everyone seems to think the market is entirely \"Irrational\" and making \"Unprecedented moves\" that I could not predict because  I've \"Never lived through a pandemic\" - but if the market is so irrational and doing things it's never done before,  why are you watching the news and wonder WTF is going on in the market in April, and I am writing posts about it in  March? I'm not smart. I just studied the patterns.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do not know why it works. More and more as  I see it working while bad things are happening I wish it did not work, but it does.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you go through all my posts  you'll see my forecasts are very accurate. I'm sometimes a bit out. Often I make trades that I could have done better on. I am not perfect. I'm aware of my need for improvement in  various areas of my analysis - but the fact I am sometimes a bit wrong does not mean this is not working.  Me not being flawless does not mean there is not merit to what I'm using.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been right more than 90% of people I  see. I'm not bragging, I must spend 10,000% more time on this than 99% of people and so it stands to reason I understand it better.  I'm not smart, I just believe in something that works and most of you  think is a subject for mockery.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point in the pattern what would now be expected is [news events to start to slide](https://www.reddit.com/user/2020sbear/comments/gatjxp/whatever_it_is_will_be_on_the_news/).  Something a bit bad. Then something a lot bad. Followed by something terrible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you study the patterns of history, the conditions of now [best sync up with the Great Depression](https://www.reddit.com/user/2020sbear/comments/fwohg1/why_we_believe_the_us_and_world_may_be_heading/).  I know it's almost a meme to say that now, but it was not when I started saying it - every day was a new all time high when [I started to talk about it.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/SPX/KY1p7aZa-50-Years-Could-End-in-Tears-for-US-Indices/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBelow is pasted a run through of trades and forecasts this year. Both winning and losing signals are posted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n========\n\nFind a three year forecast of the [Dow Jones bear market of the 2020's here.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/16/three-year-forecast-of-dow-jones-crash/)\n\n\\---\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe US indices have been [forming a bubble](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/02/29/formingbubbles/) over the last 50 years. In 2000 and 2008 we seen the early 'Bear trap' sections of the bubble and then in the following decade we seen enthusiasm become greed and greed become delusion. The 30% gain in the S&amp;P500 through the year 2019 was the final stages of this bubble.\n\nHere is a post describing us being in the ['Delusion' stage of the bubble in January of 2020](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/SPX/KY1p7aZa-50-Years-Could-End-in-Tears-for-US-Indices/).\n\nThe pop of this bubble and the following bear market will not be a nice fast one like the crashes of 2000 and 2008, it will be a more drawn out affair where prices drop far lower. The crash of the 2020's will be more like the crash of the 1930's depression. See the analysis [leading to this conclusion here.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/01/us-indices-bubble-in-style-reflecting-the-great-depression-of-1930/)\n\nIn the months of January and February major US indices traded into the zone where a bubble template would be looking for the top to be made. Read about how this method has [worked in previous crashes here.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/05/how-technical-analysis-has-signalled-previous-stock-market-highs-and-now-again-in-2020/) First forecasts in late January were mostly stopped out. There were losing signals on the Dow [around 29,300](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/RGkn3RjW-Dow-Jones-Crucial-Support-Levels-in-the-Week-Ahead/) and some in [February at 28,900](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/xWSFpsRi-Selling-Dow-28-900/). Individual stocks shorts done poorly, One exception was the Vanguard dividends index VYM. This did make it's high on the [exact price first posted.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/VYM/BlWd0mFm-Popular-Vanguard-Has-High-Exposure-to-Bad-Market-Conditions/)\n\nIndividual stocks picks done particularly poorly in January. TSLA almost doubled from the first [shorting price of 510.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/TSLA/FOs1PP5d-Tesla-Could-Breakdown-Soon/) Some did a bit better. [Like shorting T at 39.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/T/IUgQyy8k-AT-T-Vulnerable-Debt-Cash-Flow-Leaks/)\n\nLater in February more sell signals were generated as price traded briefly over important resistance levels. If price broke back under these it would suggest market weakness. These were [170 on VTI](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/VTI/IPRCTQh9-VTI-Enters-the-Stubborn-Stage-of-a-Possible-Reversal/) and [29,000 on the Dow.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/LiV4pmmH-Dow-Jones-Crucial-Downside-Break-Possible/) Once these levels were broken the bear market began. In the following days a signal for a [30% drop on the Dow Jones came](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/Cd6Il3np-Next-Series-of-Falls-Can-Take-Dow-Down-10-000-Points/) (and was successful).\n\nIndividual stock picks did much better in February. High prices were signalled in [MSFT](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/MSFT/LWCMh0jH-Microsoft-Setting-Up-For-Hard-Landing/), [BRK](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/BRK.A/bHDf6D7j-Buffet-s-the-King-of-the-Bag-Holders/), [SPCE](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/SPCE/uFAroqOi-SPCE-and-Gravity/), [GOOG](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/GOOG/m56g98mU-Weekly-Bearish-Butterfly-Pattern/). A high on [AMZN was called](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/AMZN/b4DOD5dy-The-Amazon-Bubble/), but price later traded higher. The best signal generated was a buy on the [TVIX from 34 to 800.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/TVIX/ts9VcIlG-TVIX-Long-Term-Trend-Line-Break/)\n\nIn the month of March , 2020, the bubble popped. Most risk based assets and indices crashed over 30%. First analysis post said to [wait for a bounce to sell into](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/nVbfBVXn-Dow-Bounces-Like-a-Brick-While-Making-Big-Breakout/), but this was updated before the market opened to say prices could fall [8% and then 30% in March.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/01/30-dow-jones-drop/) At this point the TradingView account was suspended. Only one account is allowed, and this was set up specifically for a 2020's bear market. So no further posts or updates were made there.\n\nOn the 3rd of March came the first signal to [look for the down move entering somewhere in the 16,000 - 18,000 area](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/16/dow-jones-enters-end-of-denial-stage-and-start-of-the-bull-trap/) on the Dow Jones. Followed by a post on the 16th of March saying [we're entering into the bull trap.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/31/optimism-in-the-air-as-end-of-bull-trap-approaches/) The low on the Dow would be made around 18,250 on the 23rd of March. From here a rally began which has made a current high of 24,500.\n\nApril of 2020 has been the bull trap month. Some losing signals have been generated in the later couple weeks of April. A few calls on the top of the bull trap have been made. Prices have not went substantially higher, they've just not dropped. A forecast on the [17th of April marks the current high](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/16/17th-april-2020-the-bull-trap-completes/), but it looks like price can trade a bit higher. A post on the 19th of April calls for a crash in the S&amp;P500 to [1,600 within the next 5 - 10 weeks](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/19/19th-of-april-here-comes-an-attitude-readjustment/).\n\nToday is the 25th of April. Over the last two weeks forecasts of a big drop starting have been inaccurate. I very strongly suspect this is akin to the sell signals generated in late January and early February. It's the right idea, but it's just the wrong time. A top in the Dow Jones somewhere in the 24,000 - 25,000\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n============\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn advice of kindly internet strangers and the little voice in my head that screams, \"They did not even read what you said, dick\" inside my head; I won't be responding to trolls.\n\nI put forward this information for you to consider if you have an open mind to, and I post daily my ideas and trades based upon this to show real time application of it.",

I did not make any trades after submitting the FULL transfer so don\u2019t know why these shares are in limbo... \n\nHas anyone else had a similar issue? If so, were you able to get it resolved? I\u2019ve already contacted support about it, but if anyone has any info it\u2019d be greatly appreciated",

        "selftext": "OK. I am a bear for now simply because the economy is in the toilet and won't be back for a while (think 3 years). The S&amp;P 500 is down 13.7% from all time highs and the NASDAQ is down 9.27%--not even a \"correction\" anymore. There is no way that a bear market lasts 23 trading days when companies are laying off workers by the tens of millions in a country with 165 million working people, in addition to oil companies and retailers going bankrupt left and right.\n\nThe problem, of course, is that Facebook, Amazon and Google don't pay a dividend. Meanwhile, Microsoft and Apple pay a meagre 1.x % dividend. Why is this important? Retirees have the most money and are most likely to influence the markets with their money, not some random 25 year olds just starting out.\n\nRetirees need a regular source of income, and dividends are one way to get it. Yes, you see the stocks go up, but in order for you to get money out of it, you have to sell. When you sell, that part of your money is no longer participating in the stock market.\n\nSo, if you want income and stay in the market, you need something that has reasonable dividends (3-5%) and have enough profits to be able to afford paying them for the long term. You don't want high yield (10-15%) because these are probably going bust or their dividends are going to get cut soon (especially if the high yield is the result of the stock plunging 75% due to problems with the company).\n\nOh, by the way, debt is exploding at a terrifying speed (think of all kinds of fiscal stimulus paid by all countries to their residents, citizens and corporations). Oh and what about household debt that has been built up post-2008? The US fiscal stimulus can't last more than a few months and when everything reopens, there will be too many people chasing too few jobs, putting downward pressure on wages. Exploding debt + collapsing economic activity = very very slow growth going forward (You complained about how US GDP growth sucked post-GFC? Think about how much lower growth will be post-COVID!) Lower growth potential means lower P/E ratios, which basically means substantially lower prices for stocks in the face of collapsing future earnings.\n\nIf the stock market is right, and that 100X P/E for Amazon is justified, then eventually, Walmart, Target, Costco, etc... will all go out of business and the market share will get eaten by Amazon. If that kind of consolidation is actually to happen, we will see the end of capitalism because competition will no longer exist. Prices will rise to whatever the market will bear, and holders of specific assets (namely stocks of Amazon or similar monopolies) will be quadrillionaires while the rest of the world will be incapable of saving money due to, for instance, a loaf of bread that normally costs $2 becomes $20. Money will become pointless other than for the purposes of the masses enriching the 0.01%. The days of a frugal person living on $10 000 a year on a $50 000 salary will be over as that hypothetical person's spending becomes $30 000 and basically can't save anything after taxes. Standard of living for the masses in rich countries will drop to third-world levels while third world residents will starve like they do in Venezuela.\n\nFurther to that, if someone who is single, childless and makes $50 000 can barely survive, and there are about 50% of people who make less than that. This will mean that the masses will stop having kids and when they get old, population aging will cause governments to go bust because of healthcare costs--not to mention that pensions cannot survive in negative interest rate environments that last for decades. Soverign defaults will sweep the globe and that is how humanity ends.\n\nThis is a rant about how, taken to the logical extreme of what message the stock market is trying to send, is anything but good. The stock market is trying to say that, because of reduced competition, prices will soar, and as a result, the middle class craters into abject poverty and the world becomes less and less sustainable and stable and societal collapse is the only logical conclusion.",

Is it Funko 2.0?\n\nIt's very odd because Zoom did get a hit due to recent news this week but didn't really drop enough to stay down and has been rsing up gradually again. But there's a chance it'll end up back at it's original shareprice range or lower if its competitors manage to convince people to Switch, and Zoom fails to deal with pissed off customers that don't care for it's many issues.\n\nWith this inconsistent market it's hard to see where it will go. You also have the issue of whether Dr.Jerome will use his frankenstein money machine to help prop up the stock, or if not him the chinese government.",

Microsoft is another candidate, but comparable companies to amd like Nvidia have a stock prices in the hundreds. Furthermore, as amd increases its presence in the tech hardware market I feel like they will have a good chance of reaching comparable stock prices to nvidia and intel. As the tech hardware market already has incredible upside, and amd is a growing company in that market I can\u2019t imagine why they wouldn\u2019t be green in the long term.

        "selftext": "A few years after I was born (around 2001) , my grandmother invested a minor amount of money (about $2000) into Microsoft held in a joint-bank account for me that I would inherit when I turned 18. This investment yielded 80 shares at the time. I am 22 now, I have had the stocks for several years now and have done nothing but let them sit. I occasionally look at the stock price to see where things are at. I was shocked at the stock's downturn in February and was tempted to get out, but Microsoft is a solid company and their products will be in use for years and years to come. So again, I did nothing. The stock is nearly back to it's high right before the fallout and I am wondering if it would be a good idea to get out, not knowing if another fallout is impending, and wait to see if it falls. If I get out and it does fall, I can buy back more shares at a lower price and if it doesn't fall I can buy back in yielding a similar position. I have no use for the cash at the moment, this is a long-term investment. I want to know what my best course of action is, there is so much uncertainty out there and I am far from an expert on market practices. Please help.",
