        "selftext": "original post removed for a different ticker in the block of text, after about 14 edits I fixed most format issues. sorry for errors.\n\nOriginally posted to my channel --  information should be up to date but may have missed grammatical shorthand errors. All info is post-USPS debacle, and assumes they get ZERO part of the contract in the future.\n\n## Intro\n\nWorkhorse describes itself as a technology company focused on providing sustainable and cost-effective solutions to the commercial transportation sector by creating all-electric delivery trucks and drone systems, including the technology that optimizes the way these mechanisms operate\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Workhorse was founded in 2007 under the name AMP Electric Vehicles\n   * They first experimented with adding battery-electric power to two-seat roadsters\n   * Contracted to complete the 100% electric GM Sky\n   * Additionally, AMP Electric Vehicles were responsible for the creation of electrification packages for the Chevrolet Equinox SUV, the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Mercedes Benz ML350\n   * Later, AMP Electric Vehicles went public in 2010 trading on the OTC market under the ticker AMPD\n   * Acquired the Workhorse brand and assembly plant in March of 2013\n   * The asset acquisition established them as an Original Equipment manufacturer, or \u201cOEM\u201d\n   * March of 2015 AMP formally changed its name to Workhorse Group Incorporated\n* Workhorse today trades under the ticker WKHS\n   * Market Cap: $1.8 billion (finviz)\n   * Share Price: $15.05\n   * 122.63 million shares outstanding/112.69 million float\n   * Short Interest last reported around 40% for the end of May;

The truck is the jumping off point for the drone and then the pair will meet after the delivery is complete. The truck features a control center for the driver and auto-landing HorseFly roof with charging capabilities.\n* Recent updates to the drone allow for point-to-point package delivery without the need for a c1000\n* Reduces per package last-mile cost by up to 95% (\\~$0.04 per mile vs. \\~$1.00 for gas vehicle)\n* The recently granted HorseFly\u2122 patent covers any drone utilization integrated with conventional vehicle\n* COVID-19 accelerated e-commerce experimentation and adoption with contactless drone deliveries\n\n## Additional Projects\n\n* Metron:  cloud-based, remote management system to manage and track the performance of all of the vehicle as a real-time solution for fleet managers\n* Aeres Delivery App -  a custom HorseFly user control center.

Additionally, Workhorse will receive a royalty fee for each electric pickup truck delivered by Lordstown. (Should they actually make one.)\n* The global Electric Vehicles Market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22% from 2019 to 2026\u201d.  Per FACTS &amp; FACTORS\n* ARK forecasts that EV sales should increase roughly 20-fold from \\~2.2 million in 2020 to 40 million units in 2025\n* ARK estimates that at some point during the next five years, drones will deliver more than 20% of parcel shipments.\n* ARK believes that drone delivery platforms will generate roughly $275 billion in delivery revenues, $50 billion in hardware sales, and $12 billion in mapping revenue by 2030.\n\n**Who\u2019s In(vested)?**\n\nInstitutional Ownership: 45.81% (Yahoo)\n\n* Blackrock (6.05%)\n* Vanguard (4.29%)\n* Ark Invest (3.24%) \\*\\*\\* Yes Timmy, I know they unloaded their shares.\n* Robeco (3.22%)\n* Invesco (2.38%)\n\n## Comps\n\nIt is Workhorse\u2019s expectation that the non-traditional OEMs will compete head-to-head with the likes of GM, Daimler and Ford in the sub 600 cubic feet class, while the 650 - 1200 cubic feet cargo capacity space is left largely ignored. The main reason being that vehicles over 10000 lbs require a Professional driver and costs associated with increase in skill required.\n\nWorkhorse is focused in BOTH the 650-1200 cubic feet range AND 10000lb+ gvw class.\n\nI found that information **hidden away in a scroll called a \"10-k\"**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Traditional OEMs\n   * Ford eTransit/GM EV600 both have 600 cubic feet cargo capacity or less. Late 2021 production.\n   * Freightliner has both the ECascadia (class 8) and eM2 (class 6-7)\n   * Mercedez-Benz ESprinter (Only 96 mile charge; Looking for 100+ in North America. Although Mercedez partnered with Matternet for drone optimization, the WKHS\u2019s US patent should impair operations.)\n* Non-Traditional OEMs\n   * Rivian (Amazon contract; 10,000 pounds or less)\n   * Chanje v8100 (650 cubic feet cargo capacity)\n   * Bollinger Deliver-E (Production set to begin 2022; no blue chip names announced)\n\n## SWOT Analysis\n\n* Strengths\n   * Patents/Trademarks\n   * All electric OEM (made in America)\n   * Strong congressional support in OH\n   * Already have actual product\n* Weaknesses\n   * Historically poor production (prior management)\n   * Low staff count (during COVID they didn\u2019t have enough staff to assemble vehicles despite backlog of thousands of vehicles)\n   * Connection to Steve Burns\n* Opportunities\n   * Expected CAGR of both EVs and Drones over the next decade\n   * 10% equity stake in RIDE (+ royalties on any future sales if they occur)\n* Threats\n   * Never mass produced all electric C1000 or C650\n   * EV market does not rapidly expand\n   * Not a cash-positive company from direct operations\n\n## Conclusion + Position\n\n* My Position: 850 shares @ $13.89 average cost per share/$12.30 \"adjusted\" cost basis after selling covered calls Feb-April (message for screenshot if necessary; no problem!)\n* I originally discovered Workhorse digging through daily ARK invest movement emails. I found it interesting to see Cathie grabbing extraordinary amounts of shares in the company so I looked further into them. I was disappointed to see them exit their position but I have added an additional 200 shares to my portfolio since I found out.\n* Workhorse was probably way ahead of itself when it reached $40. That doesn't make it \"Deadhorse\" just because it missed out on one government contract. The government will need electrified fleets; Workhorse might stand a chance, who knows.\n* I miss flying my drone. I crashed it into a darn tree and ever since videos of the Horsefly on youtube have had to fill the void. Not the same, but it's like watching an airplane play Tetris.\n* I did not provide a list of catalysts - use the google machine\n\n## Exit Strategy\n\n* No.\n\nDisclaimer: **I am not a financial advisor**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: format issues\n\nedit2: format issues again\n\nedit3: i think i fixed the format issues",

        "selftext": "So I\u2019ve been following AMD since it was a $30 little boy share, and I\u2019ve always believed in it long. Looking at its history, you can see the annual returns over the last five years have been great. But here\u2019s why this particular autist really likes this stock. But first, a bit of backstory about AMD.\n\n###Who is AMD and why do we care?\n\n**Advanced Micro Devices** (AMD) is a computer hardware development and manufacturing company at its core. They design and sell Processors, GPUs, APUs, and the like. For anyone who has been into gaming or building PCs, you\u2019d probably recognize AMD as the \u201cbudget build\u201d: the company who\u2019s processors you buy when you don\u2019t want to shell out $900 for a top shelf Intel. They have always been seen as an underdog in Intel\u2019s shadow, with Intel having the superior clock speeds, Hyperthreading tech, and better clout when it comes to contracting.\n\n###Next Gen Consoles\n\nCurrently the latest gaming consoles are the PS5 and the Xbox Series X, both being relatively impossible to get your hands on due to the microchip shortage (more on that later). *AMD powers both.*\n\nLet that sink in. AMD has no competition for this generation of video game consoles. Every PS5 and Xbox X that gets built, AMD gets a chunk of that change. This is basically guaranteed profit for the life of the console, historically that\u2019s about 6-7 more years.\n\n###Server Hardware\n\nAMD has been expanding their server hardware lineup, and their biggest competitor Intel has dropped the ball on this one: their new server hardware isn\u2019t rolling out til Q1 2022. Meanwhile, Google is replacing outdated hardware with AMD processors. This is a big step for AMD, because it puts them in the position of no longer being the underdog, and gives them juicy, profitable market share.\n\n###CEO Lisa Su\n\nLisa Su is an awesome woman. She has a diverse background including Texas Instruments and IBM, and since she took the reigns of AMD in 2014, the stock has soared. She helped diversify their product line success, and saw the immense benefit of getting AMD server chips licensed in China.\n\n###The future of work\n\nLots of people see the future of work moving towards a larger working from home model (anecdotal). Working from home requires hardware, and people buying hardware prefer to spend less if they can, and this is the hardware AMD specializes in.\n\n###Semiconductor Shortage\n\nThe massive demand for semiconductors for everything from cars to laptops to servers has been a drag on literally the entire economy. Auto manufactory lines in Midwest America are at a standstill while car lots are barren of new vehicles because of the world\u2019s \u201cjust in time\u201d production model collapsing under increased demand.\n\nI personally believe this shortage is artificially holding down the price of AMD, as big money is slower to invest in a company that could potentially suffer from the shortage. Once things pick back up, there is a lot of potential for accelerated movement upwards as things become available to the public for purchase.\n\nAMD is a preferred client of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), which has invested billions into additional manufacturing capacity.\n\n###Get on the train before it leaves!\n\nOnce these processors start shipping out, the profits will roll in and sentiment will return. Boarding this rocket begins now! \ud83e\udd8d \ud83d\ude80 \ud83c\udf1d \n\nI hold 100 shares @84 average and some 12/17/21 $155 calls.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m profoundly autistic, my late wife\u2019s second boyfriend told me so. This is not financial advice, I am retarded.",

This is in a taxable account. My first thought was to buy SMH as TSM and NVDA are the two largest holdings. However, it lacks any AAPL and MSFT. Would the best choice be to buy SMH and also both AAPL and MSFT? Or, would it be best to buy AMD, NVDA, TSM, AMAT, TXN, AAPL and MSFT individually?",

        "selftext": " \n\n**Objective** : Draw attention to a good investment opportunity OR Draw caution to this investment and have me reconsider my position. I'm long 6000+ warrants.-This post is focusing primarily on warrants. It summarizes key details and provides subjective opinion. It also poses questions to which input is appreciated. **I know literally nothing about the technology they use and industry they operate in**, therefor I provide no opinion on the business model/reasonability of their projections. Take what I have to say with a grain of salt. That said, I hope this will provide a good information resource for those considering this investment.\n\n**Deal details/ Breakdown of funding and uses of cash:**\\-Target, Valens Semiconductor Ltd. [Valens. Pushing the Boundaries of Connectivity.](https://www.valens.com/) Deal is targeting Fall of 2021 to close.-Pipe 125mm @ 10$ , Including investment from Mediatek (a world leading SC company) Listed in Taiwan at roughly 54billion USD. [MediaTek | Homepage](https://www.mediatek.com/) , sovereign wealth funds, Breakdown is not disclosed\\*. PTK Acquisition corp will be participating in Pipe via 4mm purchase of shares @ 10$.-SPAC trust 115mm from 11.5mm share IPO\\*Primerose Development Group Limited is participating in the SPAC trust of 115mm via Forward Purchase Agreement (FPA). Primerose is comitted to hold at least 1mm common stock following the business combination. Can't find anything about this firm.-240mm cash to Valens' BS assuming no redemptions. Cash is to fund company through to positive CF, no existing shareholders will be paid out or debt paid down.\\*Opinion: strong strategic pipe, and pipe size relative to trust size seems healthy. Uses of proceeds are ideal, and sponsor participating to some degree in PIPE reflects more skin in the game.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Sponsor compensation arrangement/Warrants**\\-Sponsor holds 2.875mm CS, which represents 20% of 14.375mm float.-Sponsor holds 600,000 @ .50 each-Sponsor share vesting: 35% unvested at time of merger if a price is achieved for 20 of 30 trading days, here is the breakdown; 10% @ 12$, 12.5% @ 12.5$, 12.5% @ 15$. This is for a 3-4 year time frame.\"This not only reflects our confidence in the company, but also the fact that the PTK team intends to be very involved with the company over the long term in helping the business achieve its business plan forecast\". Source: Investor presentation/conference call.\n\n\\*Opinion: 20% sponsor shares is a rich cut for them, however the lock up is very attractive. No shares will vest within 4 years if price targets aren't achieved, and even then it's only 35% of their shares.\\*\\*QUESTION: Vesting periods for sponsor shares in the Business Combination prospectus are different from the original offering prospectus. Assuming this is a normal part of deal negotiations and the more formal BC agreement will further solidify these terms?\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Warrant Structure**  \n\\-Warrants are 2:1, meaning you need 2 warrants to buy one share. you have 5 years from BC to exercise them. They are not able to be cash settled in lieu of physical settlement.  \n\\-There are 6mm Private Placement warrants, which were originally placed at .50$ but may have changed hands/been sold to retail since (they were trading 1$+ in Dec-Feb. They differ from public warrants, as they can't be redeemed, so they have much more upside potential.  \n\\-As noted above, sponsor purchased an additional 600,000 warrants @.50  \n\\-There are 11.5mm warrants resulting from a 1:1 split from units.-Warrants can be called for redemption if share price is trading above 18$ for 20 of 30 trading days, the redemption window would be 1month.  \n\\*Opinion: If all warrants are exercised it will increase float by 9.45mm common shares, and have a diluting effect of 94.5mm @ 10$, 8.5% of Pro-Forma Equity-Value. This is my own take, not sure if it's accurate way to look at it.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThings that give me confidence in this deal;\n\nI have confidence in the targets future because of its past...  \n\\-Valen's has an impressive Executive team at the helm.-116(95) patent applications (granted), Sold &gt;25mm chips to date with 465mm Revenue to date.  \n\\-They have raised 150mm to date from notable firms.  \n\\-They have grown Rev from 3mm in 2010 to 57mm 2020.-Majority of their Rev growth will come from automotive sector, Chairman of Board has significant experience of over 35years. They're on the road in Mercedes vehicles as of 2020.  \n\\-Majority of their expenses goes to R&amp;D, 2020A was 79% of Revenue, 45mm. Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of (16mm).\n\nI have confidence in the sponsor team..  \n\\-C-suite has strong background of success/experience  \n\\-Payout structure of their CS shows a great deal of confidence  \n\\-Invested 4mm via PIPE, sponsor has skin in the game\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**How are they valuing the deal?**  \n\\-They are doing their best to find comparables, and then using EV/Rev multiples to value the company in 2023 and 2026 based on expected revenues. There's two groups of comparables, Recent Auto-tech SPACS (Indi, Velodyne, Luminar, etc), and more traditional analog/mixed signal companies (Texas Instruments/Broadcom, etc)  \n\\-2023 is meant to be more of a base-line, de-risk valuation. It is derived from existing business/prospective business on products that are already produced and available to ship. 2023 value is EV in the range of 7.4-8.3x 120mm expected revenue  \n\\-2026 is 8.5-9.5x 482mm expected revenue. They discount it back by 15% per year for a valuation of 2.6-2.3B. Current EV is at a big discount to that.  \n\\-They are valuing the deal right now at 900mm EV, which they feel is an attractive combination of future status-quo value and future hit-targets value.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_**What are my concerns?**  \nPrimarily about the possibility of the deal falling through, since i'm accumulating warrants and they'd be worth nothing. At the price they're trading right now, I feel if the deal goes through their intrinsic value can have significant boost. INDI warrants have only slightly fallen below 2, when their commons were just below 9. These warrants are at .52 \\* 2 = 1.04$...  \n\\-warrants are basically trading at split levels, .02$ more than that of private placements, and at March lows after big correction.  \n\\-Language concerning the deal covenants in the BC prospectus.\\*on one hand it states, \"PTK having at least $5,000,001 of net tangible assets remaining prior to the Transactions (after taking into account any redemption requests by PTK stockholders)\" Ok, seems easily achievable?\\*on the other hands, \" In addition, the obligations of Valens and Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions is conditioned upon, among other things, on the aggregate amount remaining in PTK\u2019s trust account after taking into account all redemptions, *plus* the aggregate amount sold in the PIPE being equal to or greater than $215,000,000.\". If I'm reading it right, this seems less certain.. **It would mean that with 125mm Pipe, only 15mm of the 115mm Trust can vote for redemption, more than that and the deal wouldn't go through, is that right??**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**WARNING**\n\nIf you plan to buy warrants, strongly consider limit orders. The spread is usually observed as .03-.04%, which is about 6-8% of their price. average 3 month volume is 95k daily, so a lot of buying can definitely move the market and you may not get a favorable price. Again, use LIMIT orders and amend them as needed. be PATIENT.\n\nTLDR\n\nThere isn't one, just skim what's important to you.\n\nThanks in advance for feedback.\n\nSources;  \n[EDGAR Entity Landing Page (sec.gov)](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=1797099&amp;owner=exclude)  \n[Valens.

        "selftext": " \n\n**Objective** : Draw attention to a good investment opportunity OR Draw caution to this investment and have me reconsider my position. I'm long 6000+ warrants.  \n\\-This post is focusing primarily on warrants. It summarizes key details and provides subjective opinion. It also poses questions to which input is appreciated. **I know literally nothing about the technology  they use and industry they operate in**, therefor I provide no opinion on the business model/reasonability of their projections. Take what I have to say with a grain of salt. \n\n**Deal details/ Breakdown of funding and uses of cash:**  \n\\-Target, Valens Semiconductor Ltd. [Valens. Pushing the Boundaries of Connectivity.](https://www.valens.com/) Deal is targeting Fall of 2021 to close.  \n\\-Pipe 125mm @ 10$ , Including investment from Mediatek (a world leading SC company) Listed in Taiwan at roughly 54billion USD. [MediaTek | Homepage](https://www.mediatek.com/) , sovereign wealth funds, Breakdown is not disclosed\\*. PTK Acquisition corp will be participating in Pipe via 4mm purchase of shares @ 10$.  \n\\-SPAC trust 115mm from 11.5mm share IPO  \n\\*Primerose Development Group Limited is participating in the SPAC trust of 115mm via Forward Purchase Agreement (FPA). Primerose is comitted to hold at least 1mm common stock following the business combination. Can't find anything about this firm.  \n\\-240mm cash to Valens' BS assuming no redemptions. Cash is to fund company through to positive CF, no existing shareholders will be paid out or debt paid down.  \n\\*Opinion: strong strategic pipe, and pipe size relative to trust size seems healthy. Uses of proceeds are ideal, and sponsor participating to some degree in PIPE reflects more skin in the game\\*.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Sponsor compensation arrangement/Warrants**  \n\\-Sponsor holds 2.875mm CS, which represents 20% of 14.375mm float.  \n\\-Sponsor holds 600,000 @ .50 each  \n\\-Sponsor share vesting: 35% unvested at time of merger if a price is achieved for 20 of 30 trading days, here is the breakdown; 10% @ 12$, 12.5% @ 12.5$, 12.5% @ 15$. This is for a 3-4 year time frame.  \n\"This not only reflects our confidence in the company, but also the fact that the PTK team intends to be very involved with the company over the long term in helping the business achieve its business plan forecast\". Source: Investor presentation/conference call.\n\n\\*Opinion: 20% sponsor shares is a rich cut for them, however the lock up is very attractive. No shares will vest within 4 years if price targets aren't achieved, and even then it's only 35% of their shares.  \n\\*\\*QUESTION: Vesting periods for sponsor shares in the Business Combination prospectus are different from the original offering prospectus. Assuming this is a normal part of deal negotiations and the more formal BC agreement will further solidify these terms?  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Warrant Structure**  \n\\-Warrants are 2:1, meaning you need 2 warrants to buy one share. you have 5 years from BC to exercise them. They are not able to be cash settled in lieu of physical settlement.  \n\\-There are 6mm Private Placement warrants, which were originally placed at .50$ but may have changed hands/been sold to retail since (they were trading 1$+ in Dec-Feb. They differ from public warrants, as they can't be redeemed, so they have much more upside potential.  \n\\-As noted above, sponsor purchased an additional 600,000 warrants @.50  \n\\-There are 11.5mm warrants resulting from a 1:1 split from units.  \n\\-Warrants can be called for redemption if share price is trading above 18$ for 20 of 30 trading days, the redemption window would be 1month.  \n\\*Opinion: If all warrants are exercised it will increase float by 9.45mm common shares, and have a diluting effect of 94.5mm @ 10$, 8.5% of Pro-Forma Equity-Value. This is my own take, not sure if it's accurate way to look at it.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Things that give me confidence in this deal;**  \nI have confidence in the targets future because of its past...  \n\\-Valen's has an impressive Executive team at the helm.  \n\\-116(95) patent applications (granted), Sold &gt;25mm chips to date with 465mm Revenue to date.  \n\\-They have raised 150mm to date from notable firms.  \n\\-They have grown Rev from 3mm in 2010 to 57mm 2020.   \n\\-Majority of their Rev growth will come from automotive sector, Chairman of Board has significant experience of over 35years. They're on the road in Mercedes vehicles as of 2020.   \n\\-Majority of their expenses goes to R&amp;D, 2020A was 79% of Revenue, 45mm. Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of (16mm). \n\nI have confidence in the sponsor team..   \n\\-C-suite has strong background of success/experience  \n\\-Payout structure of their CS shows a great deal of confidence  \n\\-Invested 4mm via PIPE, sponsor has skin in the game  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nHow are they valuing the deal?   \n\\-They are doing their best to find comparables, and then using EV/Rev multiples to value the company in 2023 and 2026 based on expected revenues. There's two groups of comparables, Recent Auto-tech SPACS (Indi, Velodyne, Luminar, etc), and more traditional analog/mixed signal companies (Texas Instruments/Broadcom, etc)  \n\\-2023 is meant to be more of a base-line, de-risk valuation. It is derived from existing business/prospective business on products that are already produced and available to ship. 2023 value is EV in the range of 7.4-8.3x 120mm expected revenue  \n\\-2026 is 8.5-9.5x 482mm expected revenue. They discount it back by 15% per year for a valuation of 2.6-2.3B. Current EV is at a big discount to that.   \n\\-They are valuing the deal right now at 900mm EV, which they feel is an attractive combination of future status-quo value and future hit-targets value.   \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n**What are my concerns?**   \nPrimarily about the possibility of the deal falling through, since i'm accumulating warrants and they'd be worth nothing. At the price they're trading right now, I feel if the deal goes through their intrinsic value can have significant boost. INDI warrants have only slightly fallen below 2, when their commons were just below 9. These warrants are at .52 \\* 2 = 1.04$...  \n\\-warrants are basically trading at split levels, .02$ more than that of private placements, and at March lows after big correction.   \n**-Language concerning the deal covenants in the BC prospectus.**   \n\\*on one hand it states, \"PTK having at least $5,000,001 of net tangible assets remaining prior to the Transactions (after taking into account any redemption requests by PTK stockholders)\" Ok, seems easily achievable?  \n\\*on the other hands, \" In addition, the obligations of Valens and Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions is conditioned upon, among other things, on the aggregate amount remaining in PTK\u2019s trust account after taking into account all redemptions, *plus* the aggregate amount sold in the PIPE being equal to or greater than $215,000,000.\". If I'm reading it right, this seems less certain.. **It would mean that with 125mm Pipe, only 15mm of the 115mm Trust can vote for redemption, more than that and the deal wouldn't go through, is that right??**  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nWARNING  \n\n\nIf you plan to buy warrants, strongly consider limit orders. The spread is usually observed as .03-.04%, which is about 6-8% of their price. average 3 month volume is 95k daily, so a lot of buying can definitely move the market and you may not get a favorable price. Again, use LIMIT orders and amend them as needed. be PATIENT. \n\nTLDR\n\nThere isn't one, just skim what's important to you. \n\nThanks in advance for feedback.",
