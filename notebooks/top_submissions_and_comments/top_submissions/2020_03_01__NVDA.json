        "selftext": "Assume for a moment that recent technological advancements in cloud, AI, automation, etc has created a lot of excitement about the future and it wasn't just a bubble and rather good ol' exuberance, maybe a little excessive but not dangerously so.   Also, don't forget the Donald's  deregulation.   Yeah it's dangerous and stupid for the planet, but \\*\\*\\*\\* me, it really lets the capitalism roar loudly.    Tragedy of the commons can take awhile to bite you in the ass, especially at a global scale.\n\nOk, so the virus comes along and says \"look, any business that relies on human contact is totally \\*\\*\\*\\*ed.\"   So bang, market comes crashing down, because there are a lot of tickers in the S&amp;P that do rely on human contact.  You know, gaming / retail / restaurants -  MGM, WYNN, DRI, ULTA, HD, and yeah maybe even the health ones, but they have always been in a precarious spot - LNC, UHS, UNM.   DIS too got hit, but something tells me they will weather this.   They're more than just a bunch of resorts.\n\nBut those aside, really, if we assume the market was not really in a bubble before but merely a reflection of a society becoming wealthier due to tech and money was more free to do its thing.  Also, we see approval numbers come out that show Donald is actually pretty popular with his handling of the virus.\n\nWhy shouldn't the market take off like a rocket?  Yeah, those tickers above I think are still \\*\\*\\*\\*ed, but everything else should do OK.   Besides, they were stupid businesses anyway and did very little for over all social productivity.  They were just mostly expensive, time consuming entertainment and social waste- what does that really do anyways? \n\nWe may have to restructure our economy so that we're all more efficient in how we become entertained, but this actually may be a good thing, and reason to be optimistic about the future.\n\nI'm talking MSFT, AMZN, GOOG(L), AAPL, NFLX, INTC, T, VZ, NVDA, NFLX, ADBE,  etc.  XLK is a reasonable tracker here.\n\nI'm not saying buy calls, I'm just saying that the reports of death may have been exaggerated and Social distancing is not necessarily a bad thing.   Lots of very very productive people work and learn from home.\n\nAnd then, of course let's not forget - the money machines go BRRRR \\* 10\\^infinity.",

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/wallstreetbets sub! Welcome to the new trading week and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market movers and news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[Today's Top Headlines for Monday, March 30th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/30/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-30-2020.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures were pointing to a modest decline for the Dow Jones Industrial Average at Monday\u2019s open after President Donald Trump extended national social distancing guidelines to April 30. The Dow, which closed 4% lower Friday, did soar 12.8% for the week, logging its best weekly gain since 1938 and raising questions about whether blue chips have bottomed. However, heading into Monday\u2019s session, the Dow was still nearly 27% off last month\u2019s record highs. The yield on the 10-year Treasury remained below 1% early Monday. U.S. oil prices sank below $20 per barrel, near 18-year lows hit earlier this month.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * On Sunday, mortgage bankers warned that Federal Reserve mortgage purchases are unbalancing the home lending market. In addition to the Fed\u2019s extraordinary no limit fixed-income purchases, Wall Street analysts and economists said it would not be out of the question to see the central bank take for the first time ever a passive interest in the performance of the stock market.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Preparing the nation for a death toll that could exceed 100,000 from the coronavirus, Trump on Sunday walked back his previous remarks about wanting to reopen the country for business by Easter. In continuing social distancing until the end of next month, the president said, \u201cNothing would be worse than declaring victory before the victory has been won.\u201d Earlier on Sunday, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said the country could see up to 200,000 deaths and millions of infections. However, he also cautioned that those numbers are based on outbreak modeling and nothing is certain.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * The U.S., which has the most known coronavirus infections in the world, saw confirmed cases jump to over 143,000 with 2,513 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. New York has about 40% of those cases and fatalities. A field hospital has been set up inside New York\u2019s Central Park to treat coronavirus patients. Abbott Laboratories, which received FDA emergency use authorization on Friday for a test that can detect coronavirus in 5 minutes, was praised by Trump. \u201cAbbott has stated that they will begin delivering 50,000 tests each day, starting this week,\u201d he said. Abbott shares were soaring about 8% in the premarket.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Global coronavirus cases increased to over 730,000 with 34,685 deaths and more than 149,000 recoveries. Italy, No. 2 to the U.S. in cases with about 97,700, has the worst death toll. Italy\u2019s 10,779 fatalities are more than three times as many as China\u2019s 3,308 deaths. Rounding out the top three, Spain just surpassed China in infections, with over 85,000 cases and more than double China\u2019s death toll at 6,803. China, where the pandemic started in December, has the world\u2019s fourth most known infections, nearing 82,200 cases. Germany is No. 5 in worldwide cases at about 62,400. It has 541 deaths.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Amazon warehouse workers in Staten Island, one of the five boroughs of New York City, plan to strike on Monday to call attention to what they claim is the lack of protections for employees. Chris Smalls, a management assistant and a lead organizer of the strike, told CNBC that workers at the fulfillment center known as JFK8, have grown increasingly concerned about coming into work after an employee tested positive for the coronavirus there last week. Amazon told CNBC that the company was supporting the individual in quarantine and asked anyone who was in contact with the worker to stay home with pay for two weeks. JFK8 remains open.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/pzD22Kh.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/EsF6mmi.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/mce1VeY.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/5rLsTWv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/vOVEFHa.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($RH $BB $VFF $CHWY $KMX $WBA $PAYS $TTNP $STZ $CALM $GNLN $CSU $CAG $MKC $RMBL $GPL $HEXO $PVH $DARE $CTEK $CYD $NVCN $LW $AYI $ICLK $ALPN $APOG $UNF $EAST $SMTS $CSSE $SCHN $LNDC $NG $RECN $EDAP $APTX $ASND $VRNT $MOTS $VERO)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/InmHVgs.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($GRWG $GNLN $RMBL $CALM $CTEK $CYD)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Sm5LctR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ho9EpoV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/hrNOYzf.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/q0iWKbS.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/pnJXRXy.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/9T9bEYz.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/qMxQyex.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/r6VRiZb.pngg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/BD1YIpS.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/TfbQnba.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/EysvYE9.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/ycEzL4P.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/uwjtT4d.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #6!](https://i.imgur.com/RPQKKYw.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #7!](https://i.imgur.com/G4gNNJx.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:\n\n* ABT\n* AXSM\n* JNJ\n* NVDA\n* CALM\n* BK\n* CAKE\n* CVNA\n* APD\n* UBS\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/30/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-jj-sanofi-regeneron-la-z-boy-apple-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)** \u2013 The company announced it has identified a lead COVID-19 vaccine candidate, and plans to begin phase 1 clinical trials by September at the latest.

Both NVDA and AMD appear to be holding the support line that formed last week very well. Assuming NVDA will at least go low enough to retest last week's' support, that would net more profit then puts on SPY.

The Dow, which closed 4% lower Friday, did soar 12.8% for the week, logging its best weekly gain since 1938 and raising questions about whether blue chips have bottomed. However, heading into Monday\u2019s session, the Dow was still nearly 27% off last month\u2019s record highs. The yield on the 10-year Treasury remained below 1% early Monday. U.S. oil prices sank below $20 per barrel, near 18-year lows hit earlier this month.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * On Sunday, mortgage bankers warned that Federal Reserve mortgage purchases are unbalancing the home lending market. In addition to the Fed\u2019s extraordinary no limit fixed-income purchases, Wall Street analysts and economists said it would not be out of the question to see the central bank take for the first time ever a passive interest in the performance of the stock market.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Preparing the nation for a death toll that could exceed 100,000 from the coronavirus, Trump on Sunday walked back his previous remarks about wanting to reopen the country for business by Easter. In continuing social distancing until the end of next month, the president said, \u201cNothing would be worse than declaring victory before the victory has been won.\u201d Earlier on Sunday, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said the country could see up to 200,000 deaths and millions of infections. However, he also cautioned that those numbers are based on outbreak modeling and nothing is certain.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * The U.S., which has the most known coronavirus infections in the world, saw confirmed cases jump to over 143,000 with 2,513 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. New York has about 40% of those cases and fatalities. A field hospital has been set up inside New York\u2019s Central Park to treat coronavirus patients. Abbott Laboratories, which received FDA emergency use authorization on Friday for a test that can detect coronavirus in 5 minutes, was praised by Trump. \u201cAbbott has stated that they will begin delivering 50,000 tests each day, starting this week,\u201d he said. Abbott shares were soaring about 8% in the premarket.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Global coronavirus cases increased to over 730,000 with 34,685 deaths and more than 149,000 recoveries. Italy, No. 2 to the U.S. in cases with about 97,700, has the worst death toll. Italy\u2019s 10,779 fatalities are more than three times as many as China\u2019s 3,308 deaths. Rounding out the top three, Spain just surpassed China in infections, with over 85,000 cases and more than double China\u2019s death toll at 6,803. China, where the pandemic started in December, has the world\u2019s fourth most known infections, nearing 82,200 cases. Germany is No. 5 in worldwide cases at about 62,400. It has 541 deaths.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Amazon warehouse workers in Staten Island, one of the five boroughs of New York City, plan to strike on Monday to call attention to what they claim is the lack of protections for employees. Chris Smalls, a management assistant and a lead organizer of the strike, told CNBC that workers at the fulfillment center known as JFK8, have grown increasingly concerned about coming into work after an employee tested positive for the coronavirus there last week. Amazon told CNBC that the company was supporting the individual in quarantine and asked anyone who was in contact with the worker to stay home with pay for two weeks. JFK8 remains open.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/pzD22Kh.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/EsF6mmi.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/mce1VeY.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/5rLsTWv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/vOVEFHa.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($RH $BB $VFF $CHWY $KMX $WBA $PAYS $TTNP $STZ $CALM $GNLN $CSU $CAG $MKC $RMBL $GPL $HEXO $PVH $DARE $CTEK $CYD $NVCN $LW $AYI $ICLK $ALPN $APOG $UNF $EAST $SMTS $CSSE $SCHN $LNDC $NG $RECN $EDAP $APTX $ASND $VRNT $MOTS $VERO)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/InmHVgs.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($GRWG $GNLN $RMBL $CALM $CTEK $CYD)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Sm5LctR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ho9EpoV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/hrNOYzf.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/q0iWKbS.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/pnJXRXy.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/9T9bEYz.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/qMxQyex.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/r6VRiZb.pngg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/BD1YIpS.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/TfbQnba.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/EysvYE9.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/ycEzL4P.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/uwjtT4d.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #6!](https://i.imgur.com/RPQKKYw.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #7!](https://i.imgur.com/G4gNNJx.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:\n\n* ABT\n* AXSM\n* JNJ\n* NVDA\n* CALM\n* BK\n* CAKE\n* CVNA\n* APD\n* UBS\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/30/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-jj-sanofi-regeneron-la-z-boy-apple-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)** \u2013 The company announced it has identified a lead COVID-19 vaccine candidate, and plans to begin phase 1 clinical trials by September at the latest.

        "selftext": "Good Morning. Here's the watch list for today.\n\nGap Ups: DRAD, JNUG/NUGT, NNVC, NVAX, TVIX\n\nGap Downs: AAPL, AOBC, BYND, CSCO, CY, DAL, FB, JPM, MSFT, NVDA, TSLA\n\nPossible Day 2 Runners: TDOC, ZM, INO\n\nCorona Virus Related stocks: AHPI, CODX, INO, LAKE, MRNA, NNVC, TDOC, VIR\n\nThe market is gapping down pretty big which usually makes for a tough trading day. With that being said, there are plenty of stocks gapping today and most are gapping with the market. Had I included them all, this list would be ridiculously large so I picked what I thought were the best. Many times stocks will bounce at the open on a large gap like today but due to the extreme nature of the move, and also the SPY not holding the 200 DMA yesterday, we could see some continued selling pressure.\n\nMost airline stocks are extremely oversold and very extended so I didn't add them to my list. Yesterday I mentioned if the market tanked that I would long the TVIX, you can see today why I made that statement yesterday and the TVIX trade worked. However today is a new day. I will be very patient today, and wait for patterns. Days like today it's easy to get chopped up. For now temporary support on the SPY at 285, next after that is the 282 - 280 area. Good luck, be patient and be careful out there.",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRelatively new to options (&lt; 1 month). I have been taking advantage with put options the past few weeks, however, with the market at record lows and possibly further down to go due to the current coronavirus situation, I assume in the near future that this will be a once in a decade opportunity to buy stocks cheap for many of us.\n\nNo one knows when we will hit the bottom of the market but WHEN IT DOES, I was wondering what would be the best LONG-TERM plays to take advantage of on some of these blue chip companies that are bound to go back up.  LEAPS or shares?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy logical thought was to buy as many LEAPS as possible that expire in 2021 or 2022 (APPL, MSFT, NVIDIA, GOOGLE,  even SPY ETF?, etc.) since these stocks should rebound back to pre-coronavirus levels. Based on my very limited knowledge in option trading, wouldn't these be guaranteed to net you a sizeable profit down the road? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOR would it be better to just buy shares outright from these companies instead? What am I missing here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks.",

I definitely didn't see it coming. There are probably many others who are in the same boat as I am and I just had the mindset of \"gotta hold, it's gonna recover soon\" but now I'm really starting to feel that worry and fear that the market is not going to recover for a long time since according to many reports, we aren't even at the peak of the crisis yet. I'm down about an average of 10-12 percent from my initial buy in. Fortunately enough, I did buy actual \"good\" stocks (objectively speaking) most of which are technology stocks - MSFT, NVIDIA, AMD, IBM, etc. How worried should I be?

What I'm trying to say is if a price seems like it's a steal and you truly believe in the company, then buy! Time in the market is better than timing the market, almost always.

        "selftext": "TLDR: Nvidia, Netflix, Dropbox, Facebook look like decent plays for a rebound. For the truly truly autistic - there is Micron.\n\nHere's my reasoning - the market has sold off a whole bunch in the past week, but some look much weaker than others right now. I wouldn't touch Apple with a 10 foot pole because it has gone up so far, and was the favorite for so long. But if there is a rebound, which stocks might be the strongest? Not the ones everyone has been FOMOing into for the past 2 months because those people have just got burned (I'm looking at you MSFT $200 call holders). \n\nAnd definitely not $SPCE - probably one of the worst ideas ever to come across this sub. \n\nIf I look at which ones have held up very strong the past week and close on Friday, Nvidia definitely gets my attention. It's been a slower climber but recently broke out and last week just retested its upward trend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$NVDA still on an linear uptrend, up 7&amp;#37; on Friday 2\\/28](https://preview.redd.it/a9vdb1w6l5k41.png?width=909&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0f7eb6f3ac9f0cf270f390dac9608d48d6ebbfe)\n\nMedia companies with no physical presence (hence coronavirus safe) also seem like decent bets. I'm talking about Netflix and Facebook here. $FB and $NFLX are the only FAANG stocks not breaking out to new highs recently and there could be a rotation of money into them as they are minimally affected by coronavirus. Also Facebook has announced a $10 billion stock buyback.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$NFLX mostly flat last week, still in solid uptrend](https://preview.redd.it/fhafupxfl5k41.png?width=880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72057d5a941678e3deda16910e4418f4e988180f)\n\nDon't have a position because last week was insane, but watching.",

I've been gambling with SQQQ, TZA, DWT, SPXU, etc, hence all the cash + I luckily pulled out  all my investments very early into this market crash. PUTS on SPY, amiiright? Might be too risky for my blood, personally. I've got about \\~$55K to invest. With so many companies I fancy, and trying to diversify my future portfolio I'm wondering how much to DCA into each company over the next couple months. I'd love feedback.\n\n I've been investing for \\~8 years, mostly doing DCA and not looking at my portfolio for months at a time. Been out of the market for \\~2 years cause buying a house took every penny. Just decided to get back in, in Jan ... almost perfectly timed haha.\n\nWhat companies don't you like? How much would you initially purchase into? Would you cut down on the number of companies to invest into? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: I grabbed prices, ratios, etc at some point over the last couple days, so numbers are a fuzzy\n\n**MSFT, Microsoft** \n\n* It's Microsoft. They are a great company with every lasting appeal to wether this crash and to continue to be a great business in the future. While they are less sexy than their 2 major OS competitors (Apple, Google (Android)), they have such an entrenched position into the business world, I can't see how they would ever fade away at this point. The deal they are making, where their going to carry Linux kernel in Windows, or the deals they are making with their XBOX brand, or talks they Azure is going to really take off cause it's a far better equipped business to partner with. yah MSFT, no brainer. \n* EPS 5.74\n* P/E 25.59\n* Yield 1.38%\n* Peak 52wk price 188.2\n* Discount from 52wk @ price $146.92, -21.93% \n\n**AAPL, Apple** \n\n* It's Apple. They have so much cash on hand, and are positioned to continue to produce amazing products and get a huge boost from the release of 5G\n* EPS 12.6\n* P/E 19.49\n* Yield 1.25%\n* Peak 52wk price 327.85\n* Discount from 52wk @ price 246.88, -24.70% \n\n**QCOM, Qualcomm**\n\n* They stand to make so much from 5G, very profitable biz.\n* EPS 19.57\n* P/E 3.52\n* Yield 3.93%\n* Peak 52wk price 96.17\n* Discount from 52wk @ price 68.98, -28.27% \n\n**SWKS, Skyworks Solutions**\n\n* Another company that stands to profit huge from 5G\n* EPS 19.46\n* P/E 4.78\n* Yield 2.06%\n* Peak 52wk price 128.48\n* Discount from 52wk @ price 92.96, -27.65% \n\n**BA, Boeing**\n\n* So ... sigh, Boeing is too big to fail. From a US defense perspective, the federal government will probably not allow Boeing to actually go under. They've been beaten so much by the 737 Maxx grounding &amp; the current market crash, they are such a deal. I imagine those lucky souls that grabbed @ $100 a share in 2-5 years will make 3x easily.\n* EPS -\n* P/E -\n* Yield 8.65%\n* Peak 52wk price 398.66\n* Discount from 52wk @ price 158.73, -60.18% \n\n**ULTA, Ulta Beauty**\n\n* This company has great financials. With COVID-19 makeup demands will go down, but then they will rebound. With the discount on this company, seems like too good a deal to pass up\n* EPS 12.15\n* P/E 15.79\n* Yield na\n* Peak 52wk price 368\n* Discount from 52wk @ price 191, -48.10% \n\n**SBUX, Starbucks**\n\n* What a proven and dominate business.

Again look at that EPS\n* EPS 11.98\n* P/E 10.86\n* Yield 3.61%\n* Peak 52wk price 192.76 \n* Discount from 52wk @ price 133.16, -38.03% \n\n**ENPH, Enphase Energy**\n\n* It'll take a decade, but solar will become a huge part of the energy sector. It's just time.\n* EPS 1.23\n* P/E 26.28\n* Yield -\n* Peak 52wk price 59.15\n* Discount from 52wk @ price 36.13, -38.92% \n\n**SEDG, SolarEdge**\n\n* It'll take a decade, but solar will become a huge part of the energy sector.

Also, I believe they will pivot to alternative energy once it makes sense for them. The oil war has made them so cheap.\n* EPS 3.36\n* P/E 11.1\n* Yield 9.82%\n* Peak 52wk price 83.49\n* Discount from 52wk @ price 37.29, -55.34% \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Notable Companies Missing in my view**\n\n* FB, probably should? idk\n* NVDA, They own the GPU market and will probably continue to dominate\n* AMZN, AMZN to $10,000 stonks price!?!?! It's just such an expensive stock\n* NFLX, it's expensive .... I guess\n* TSLA, I will absolutely buy TSLA, it needs to slide down below $400 again. \n* LULU, Their PE is little high, I want to see more a discount\n* HD, they may get hit harder with COVID-19. Wait it out.\n* DEAC, I think they will be huge, draft kings will become huge. \n* AMD, I think we're at a moment where AMD may start to really comp at Intel's lunch in the server market. I'm in tech, in hardware, and I see in our own decisions and others that Intel has really become a mountain that cannot move to please their customers while AMD is busting there ass ... and has more attractive technology in some segments. Stay tuned. \n* PFE, should probably get some pharmaceuticals exposure.\n* DPZ, wow who else missed this boat? Should of been buying them for a while ha.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Companies I'm a hard pass on.**\n\n*  I follow video games quiet intensely, and while ATVI made me a lot of money in the past, I think their greed is starting to hamstring their profitability. Folks, are not happy with their current releases. Sure, the disgruntled voices may be the minority, but I see them turning into an EA. Which EA is profitable but ... I'm not sure the outlook is bigger/better\n\nAnyway I appreciate all thoughts, comments, feedback, trolling, hate, love, disinterest. Happy investing in this \ud83d\udc3b\ud83d\udcb9!",

These stocks will be less affected by the current situation and will be clear winners when it comes to picking stocks for investing (not yolo stocks).\n\nI personally understand tech and am therefore looking at MSFT, ADBE, NVDA, AMD, AMZN, GOOG, TWLO, CHGG, ROKU. I'm also getting to understand renewables and clean energy better and looking at some obvious tickets there. If nothing else, there's ICLN.

My portfolio is close to 40% AMZN and AAPL, 45% between GOOG MSFT TSLA NFLX BRKB and FB, and about 15% between a couple other companies including AMD, NVDA, HD, and a couple others. Down about 27% since all this started and have just been holding all along like I have the last 6-7 years. Wondering what you'd do?

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the new trading week and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market movers and news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[Today's Top Headlines for Monday, March 30th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/30/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-30-2020.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures were pointing to a modest decline for the Dow Jones Industrial Average at Monday\u2019s open after President Donald Trump extended national social distancing guidelines to April 30. The Dow, which closed 4% lower Friday, did soar 12.8% for the week, logging its best weekly gain since 1938 and raising questions about whether blue chips have bottomed. However, heading into Monday\u2019s session, the Dow was still nearly 27% off last month\u2019s record highs. The yield on the 10-year Treasury remained below 1% early Monday. U.S. oil prices sank below $20 per barrel, near 18-year lows hit earlier this month.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * On Sunday, mortgage bankers warned that Federal Reserve mortgage purchases are unbalancing the home lending market. In addition to the Fed\u2019s extraordinary no limit fixed-income purchases, Wall Street analysts and economists said it would not be out of the question to see the central bank take for the first time ever a passive interest in the performance of the stock market.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Preparing the nation for a death toll that could exceed 100,000 from the coronavirus, Trump on Sunday walked back his previous remarks about wanting to reopen the country for business by Easter. In continuing social distancing until the end of next month, the president said, \u201cNothing would be worse than declaring victory before the victory has been won.\u201d Earlier on Sunday, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said the country could see up to 200,000 deaths and millions of infections. However, he also cautioned that those numbers are based on outbreak modeling and nothing is certain.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * The U.S., which has the most known coronavirus infections in the world, saw confirmed cases jump to over 143,000 with 2,513 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. New York has about 40% of those cases and fatalities. A field hospital has been set up inside New York\u2019s Central Park to treat coronavirus patients. Abbott Laboratories, which received FDA emergency use authorization on Friday for a test that can detect coronavirus in 5 minutes, was praised by Trump. \u201cAbbott has stated that they will begin delivering 50,000 tests each day, starting this week,\u201d he said. Abbott shares were soaring about 8% in the premarket.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Global coronavirus cases increased to over 730,000 with 34,685 deaths and more than 149,000 recoveries. Italy, No. 2 to the U.S. in cases with about 97,700, has the worst death toll. Italy\u2019s 10,779 fatalities are more than three times as many as China\u2019s 3,308 deaths. Rounding out the top three, Spain just surpassed China in infections, with over 85,000 cases and more than double China\u2019s death toll at 6,803. China, where the pandemic started in December, has the world\u2019s fourth most known infections, nearing 82,200 cases. Germany is No. 5 in worldwide cases at about 62,400. It has 541 deaths.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Amazon warehouse workers in Staten Island, one of the five boroughs of New York City, plan to strike on Monday to call attention to what they claim is the lack of protections for employees. Chris Smalls, a management assistant and a lead organizer of the strike, told CNBC that workers at the fulfillment center known as JFK8, have grown increasingly concerned about coming into work after an employee tested positive for the coronavirus there last week. Amazon told CNBC that the company was supporting the individual in quarantine and asked anyone who was in contact with the worker to stay home with pay for two weeks. JFK8 remains open.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/pzD22Kh.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/EsF6mmi.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/mce1VeY.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/5rLsTWv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/vOVEFHa.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($RH $BB $VFF $CHWY $KMX $WBA $PAYS $TTNP $STZ $CALM $GNLN $CSU $CAG $MKC $RMBL $GPL $HEXO $PVH $DARE $CTEK $CYD $NVCN $LW $AYI $ICLK $ALPN $APOG $UNF $EAST $SMTS $CSSE $SCHN $LNDC $NG $RECN $EDAP $APTX $ASND $VRNT $MOTS $VERO)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/InmHVgs.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($GRWG $GNLN $RMBL $CALM $CTEK $CYD)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Sm5LctR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ho9EpoV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/hrNOYzf.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/q0iWKbS.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/pnJXRXy.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/9T9bEYz.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/qMxQyex.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/r6VRiZb.pngg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/BD1YIpS.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/TfbQnba.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/EysvYE9.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/ycEzL4P.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/uwjtT4d.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #6!](https://i.imgur.com/RPQKKYw.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #7!](https://i.imgur.com/G4gNNJx.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:\n\n* ABT\n* AXSM\n* JNJ\n* NVDA\n* CALM\n* BK\n* CAKE\n* CVNA\n* APD\n* UBS\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/30/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-jj-sanofi-regeneron-la-z-boy-apple-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)** \u2013 The company announced it has identified a lead COVID-19 vaccine candidate, and plans to begin phase 1 clinical trials by September at the latest.

        "selftext": "\nFor Trading March 10th\n \nHISTORIC ACTION\n \nIs Cruising Over?\n \nEntire Yield Curve Under 1%\n \nToday\u2019s market was down from overnight with the futures hitting \u201climit down\u201d before 4:00AM.  The DJIA opened at 9:30, like always, but was halted within 4 minutes after hitting the \u201ccircuit-breakers\u201d at -7% and trading was stopped for 15-minutes after which we reopened and headed lower again, touching -1946, and by noon we had recovered to only -1183, but by 3:00 we had made a new low of 23,706 -2158 before a rally to -1650 before another sell-off to close DJIA \u2013 2013.76 (7.79%), NASDAQ -624.94 (7.29%), S&amp;P 500 -225.81 (7.60%), the Russell -135.79 (9.37%, and DJ Transports, the biggest loser -874.21 (9.76%).  Market internals were just short of absurd with numbers that I had to go to several sources to make sure were correct.  NYSE raw numbers were 70:2973 or 43:1 and NASDAQ was 169:3190 or 19:1. The DJIA was 30:0 after WMT, which held on all day fell into the red.  The biggest losers were not double, but triple-digit movers with BA -237, AAPL -155, GS -136, HD -123, CAT -117, and JPM -100DPs.  The only single digit losers were VZ and WMT.  It was an interesting day, but not one I\u2019d like to see too often.  The market was influenced by not only COVID-19, but also the fact that OPEC couldn\u2019t come up with an agreement to limit oil production.  Over the weekend Saudi Arabia declared a price war with Russia, the main opponent to any agreement.  Interest rates continued to fall, and that, along with the oil news sent the banking names down dramatically.  I\u2019ll list those below in their sector.\n \nOur \u201copen forum\u201d on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.  It is informative and allows me to share insights as the market is open and moving.  The link is: https://discord.gg/ATvC7YZ  and I will be there and active from before the open and all day.  It\u2019s a great place to share ideas and gain some insights.\n \nSECTORS: Other names in the news: It was a very tough day for everyone.  While we did have a \u201cMerger Monday\u201d deal between AON and WLTW, neither of the participants made any headway.  AON Plc, is buying Willis, Towers, Watson in the biggest insurance transaction ever and creating the world\u2019s largest insurance broker, surpassing Marsh &amp; McLennan (MMC) and worth about $80Billion.\n \nThere were a couple of names higher, just a few, and the main ones were in the auto parts segment with ORLY finishing $373.63 +5.55 (1.51%), AZO, $1113.69 +53.38 (5.03%) and AAP $130.36 +2.45 (1.92%).  This group has been weak for the past 4-6 months.  Also higher was discounter DLTR, $83.51 +3.27 (4.08%).\n \nThe Cruise lines continued to fall with all making new lows.  RCL fell to $48.27 - 16.74 (25.75%) and down from $135 in January.  CCL fell to $21.74 -5.41 (19.93%) and down from $52, while NCLH was $19.81 \u2013 7.29 (26.9%) and down from $60.  This is absolutely uninvestable. There will clearly be a point at which the shorts cover, but this group is dead money for a while.\n \nIn more COVID-19 news, Inovio (INO) which moved from $2.40 to $16.00 on the news that it would start human trials of its vaccine in April.  This morning at $19.36 before collapsing all the way back to $8.53 before closing $9.83 -4.26 (30.23%).\n \nBut the HOMERUN OF THE DAY was another name I talked about in this space, AIM Immuno-Tech, Inc (AIM).  The company said that its drug, Ampligen will begin testing at National Inst. Of Infectious Diseases in Japan that could play an important role in developing a protective early-onset therapy for COVID-19.  The stock has been reverse split both 1:12 in 2016 and more recently 1:44 last June and traded under $ .40 had moved up to $3.50 this month and traded up on the news finishing $6.10 +4.00 (190%) and is continuing in extended hours to $8.75 and is currently $7.69 up an additional $1.59 for a total gain of $5.59 (266%).  Quite a highlight on a dismal day.\n \n \nBIOPHARMA: was LOWER with all names falling hard with BIIB -20.76, ABBV -3.55, REGN -20.58, ISRG -44.48, MYL -1.19, TEVA -1.42, VRTX -13.85, BHC -2.69, INCY -4.42, ICPT -6.88, LABU -11.47 (24.95%), and IBB $109.80 -8.23 (6.97%).\n \nCANNABIS: stocks were LOWER with TLRY -2.47 (24.65%) and KERN -2.58 (37.34%) and none down less than 7.48%.  The ETF, MJ $11.74 -1.36 (10.38%).\n \nDEFENSE: was LOWER with some major loses by LMT -31.47, RTN -14.83, GD -13.01, TXT -5.48 (15.26%), UTX -12.48, NOC -15.58, BWXT -5.14, TDY -33.73, and ITA was $174.00 -21.04 (10.79%).\n \nRETAIL was LOWER with major losses. The brands were the biggest losers on the day.   M-1.12, JWN -1.88, KSS -2.84, DDS -2.37, JCP - .015, WMT -1.17, TGT -1.92, TJX -1.35, RL -10.78 (10.19%), UAA -1.46 (11.56%), LULU -22.44 (10.27%), TPR -3.35 (15.44%), CPRI -3.13 (13.65%) and XRT $37.01 -2.12 (5.42%).\n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were LOWER with GOOGL -80.14, AMZN -96.19, AAPL -21.42, FB -11.40, NFLX -22.48, NVDA -21.04, IBM -10.38, TSLA -92.48 (13.01%), BABA -7.24, BIDU -8.52, BA -36.22 (13.81%) on continuing problems with the 737MAX and the general market, CAT -16.42 (13.52%), DIS -10.55, and XLK $82.84 -6.07 (6.83%).\n \nFINANCIALS were LOWER with most down over 10% with the market and softness in rates with GS -19.14, JPM -13.53, BAC -3.59, MS -4.35, C -9.34, PNC -15.48, AIG -5.13, TRV -8.54, AXP -9.94, and XLF $22.80 -2.75 (10.76%).\n \nOIL, $31.13 -10.15 (24.58%) The stocks were LOWER with the dramatic fall on the \u201cprice war\u201d between the Saudi\u2019s and Putin.  It\u2019s difficult to even relate to the prices I\u2019m seeing.  In August when OXY bought APC for $57billion OXY was just over $50. Tonight it closed $12.51 \u201314.35 (53.43%) and the COMBINED market-cap is only $11.4Billion.  The rest of the list was equally bad with CVX -13.42, XOM -4.94, MRO 4.06 -2.77 (40.56%), MPC -5.43, APA 10.22 -10.48 (50.6%), BP -5.66 and XLE $34.98 -7.52 (17.69%).\n \nMETALS, GOLD: $1,675.70 +3.30. After the rebound, and the overnight move to $1,704.30 we sold off as liquidation hit even the yellow metal.  We managed to close up on the day, but it was a disappointment just the same.  Our $1.40 position in the GLD calls finished $1.65 +.11.\n \nBITCOIN: closed $7,850 -1,315. We broke to the downside overnight and fell to a low of $7,640, which closed a gap left on the breakout back in January.  While I want to add the 350 sold just over a week ago, I want to wait and see some stabilization.  We did have 2 subscribers add to new positions under the close today.  But we still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $8.86 \u2013 1.72 today.\n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

        "selftext": "For Trading March 20th\n \nAnother Range Day\n \nYields Fall\n \nOil Rebounds\n \n \nYesterday I said that \u201ctoday\u2019s market was actually not as bad as it seemed.\u201d  And today while we had a sharp decline early, we rallied back up toward yesterday\u2019s  highs, and when the dust settled we were DJIA +188.27 (.95%), NASDAQ +160.74 (2.3%), S&amp;P 500 +11.29 (.47%), the Russell +67.52 (6.81%) and DJ Transports +107.29 (1.54%).  Also, yesterday I said \u201cthe obvious culprit was the Oil.  After the close, the oil bounced and held most of the gains until it had rallied up about 24% and closed $25.91 +5.08 after trading as high as $28.28.  Market internals were better with the A/D on NYSE at 3:1, and about the same on NASDAQ.  The DJIA was 17 Up, 13 Down, and for the first time in over a week, there were no triple-digit losers or gainers.  The biggest movers were MCD +83 and GS +64 on the upside and JNJ -54 DPs. Strong sectors included Energy and consumer discretionary, while the weak included utilities, consumer stables, health care and real estate.  The technology and small caps outperformed.  The thought that Mr. Trump has the relationship or talent as an arbitrator to settle a dispute between the Kingdom and Putin the thug is unlikely.  I also issued a YouTube video (#151) on today\u2019s closing comments:  https://youtu.be/spf45YUFaxc\n \n \n \nOur \u201copen forum\u201d on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.

It\u2019s a great place to share ideas and gain some insights.\n \n \nSECTORS: Other names in the news: While there is plenty to discuss, I\u2019ll just hit a few high points.  All U.S. industries are lining up with their hands out looking for their piece of however many trillions of dollars and favorable legislation they can extract through their state politicians.  While I get that nobody in the cruise industry, or the hotel and allied hospitality sectors or any manufacturing business had any fault in COVID-19, at some point in time, they must take responsibility for the cash they squandered on stock buybacks instead retaining earnings for when the business cycle went through a slowdown.  I know I\u2019ve railed about this for a while, but Capitalism works because it enforces some degree of fiscal responsibility on the operators of business.  And if they fail, they fail.  That what the bankruptcy laws are about.  If you need a primer on it, just ask the president. If you run a business into the ground, by any means, you lose.\n \nOn the rocket to \u201calmost the moon\u201d followed by a crash and burn, we had Blue Apron (APRN) started the week at $2.28 and yesterday it closed $16.25 +9.70, but today after trading $28.84 before collapsing to finish $14.34 -1.91 (11.75%).  In case you forgot, this little beauty was reverse split 1:15 last year, so todays close is still under $1.00.\n \nBIOPHARMA: was HIGHER with TEVA the big winner @ $8.10 +1.41 (21.08%) on the news that it is a manufacturer of Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate, a potential treatment for COVID-19 and are donating the tablets to hospitals nationwide.  ICPT was +8.80 (18.20%), LABU +2.11 (14.36%) and IBB $99.51 +1.18 (1.2%).\n \n \nCANNABIS: Even this group had some winners with TLRY +1.16 (46.96%), PYX, yesterday\u2019s biggest loser bounced back to close +.40 (27.59%) and MJ $9.65 +.55 (6.04%).\n \nDEFENSE: was MIXED with LMT -20.14 (6.12%), RTN +6.39, and yesterday\u2019s big loser, TDY +25.06 (12.46%), and ITA $126.19 +2.78 (2.25%).\n \nRETAIL was MIXED with JWN +1.49 (7.54%), DDS +4.78 (12%), and WMT -3.34, RL \u20133.11, UAA +.94 (10.99%), CPRI +2.40 (31.91%) and XRT $29.27 +1.52 (5.48%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were MOSTLY HIGHER with GOOGL +19.30, AMZN +43.00, AAPL -3.42, FB +3.94, NFLX +18.54, NVDA +7.48, IBM -4.50, TSLA +32.78(9.07%), BABA +1.00, BIDU +5.50, BA -7.08, CAT +1.69, DIS +4.45 and XLK $74.85 +.27 (.36%).\n \n \nFINANCIALS were MIXED with GS +4.70, JPM -.19, BAC -.04, MS -.14, C +2.57, PNC +4.76, AIG +1.77 (9.42%), TRV +4.38, AXP +1.65, and XLF $19.61 +.42 (2.19%).\n \n \nOIL, $5.91 +5.08. The stocks were HIGHER with the price of Oil trading as high as 28.28).  The oil is slightly higher in extended hours and XLE is $25.61 +1.63 (6.8%).\n \n \nMETALS, GOLD: $1,479.30 +1.40. After the liquidation of the past few day\u2019s gold tried to work higher but gave it up closing barely changed.  I still expect a move back toward $1,600 to unfold.  \n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $6240 +900.

        "selftext": "For Trading March 26th\n \nSanders Foils Rally\n \nBA Drives the DJIA\n \n \n \nToday was driven early by BA and the statement that it would not need to accept the kind of share dilution that would be part of a government bailout.  The market seemed to take that as a good thing, at least for BA, which has rebounded from $89.00 to a high of $174.77 in the last week.  This dragged the DJIA higher but left the S&amp;P and NASDAQ down at the open.  We had a great deal of enthusiasm in both directions but by late in the day everyone was in the green.  While there were selloffs in all the indexes on the news that Bernie Sanders would oppose the current relief legislation because it gave corporations to easy a time, and Ms. AOC saying that she MAY oppose the unanimous consent resolution, which would delay financial relief, we finished with the DJIA +495.55 (2.39%), NASDAQ \u2013 33.56 (.45%) and S&amp;P 500 +28.23 !.15%), the Russell +13.83 (1.26%) and the DJ Transports +184.07 (2.44%) the biggest winner, but off 424 off its high.  Market internals were okay, with NYSE 4:1 and NASDAQ only 1.7:1 up.  The DJIA was 18:12 higher but the biggest 5 gainers, BA +210, UNH +100, UTX +63, V +50 and AXP +24DP\u2019s added up to a gain of $465.\nThis the link to my closing comment:  https://youtu.be/BW3S_KKvjAo\n \nUnfortunately we bought some SPY puts (a small position) at $3.20 that closed @ $2.91, and were stopped out @ $1.58 today.\n \n \nOur \u201copen forum\u201d on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.

NKE had earnings after the close last night and after falling from $95 to $60, has rebounded to close today $79.01 +6.68 (9.24%).  \n \n \nBIOPHARMA: was MIXED with ISRG the big gainer +28.41 (6.58%) and ICPT +3.97 (6.84%).  VRTX was the biggest loser -13.04 (5.84%). The IBB was $102.00 -.57 (.55%).\n \n \nCANNABIS: This group finally caught a bid on the news that several reported big jumps in revenues in California with TLRY + 1.38 (34.33%), still not impressive after falling from $300, CGC +1.02 (7.86%), CRON +.20, GWPH +1.25, ACB +.04, PYX +.14, NBEV +.05, CURLF -.38 (9.79%), KERN +.78 (18.13%) and MJ $11.45 +1.04 (9.99%).\n \n \nDEFENSE: was HIGHER with none up less than 5% and several gainers like LMT +33.34 (11.54%), TXT +3.05 (13.27%), UTX +9.43 (10.87% and 63 DPs), TDY +21.17 (7.97%) with ITA $147.97 +16.80 (12.81%).\n \n \nRETAIL was MIXED with the retailers mixed but the brands all higher.

We traded in a short range again today and finished mid-range on the day. While I want to add the 350 sold just over a week ago, I want to wait and see some stabilization.

        "selftext": "\nFor Trading March 19th\n \nAnother Halt!\n \nYields Rise\n \nOil Collapse\n \n \nToday\u2019s market was actually not as bad as it seemed.  We finally got some dramatic action on the downside, and a rally back up into the range that I thought we were building yesterday.  The obvious culprit was the Oil.  In case you missed it, here is my midday video, #148  https://youtu.be/7eKv4Z2Qox0 .  I\u2019m going off script because I have several issues to discuss, and frankly, I\u2019m not really sure we need to go over all the damage that seems to have been done.  First of all, the big numbers: DJIA -1338.46 (6.3%) after being -2320, NASDAQ -344.94 (4.7%) after being -648, S&amp;P 500 -131.09 (5.18%) after being -249, the Russell -115.50 (10.44%), and the DJ Transports -496.79 (6.65%) after being -987.  Internals were NYSE 15:1 and NASDAQ 8.9:1.  Volume increased, especially on NASDAQ.  The rally came late in the day and while there was an ECB stimulus package and China lowering rates, it felt to me as if the we were just so \u201cwrung out\u201d that we were due a bounce.\n \nAnother issue that came to the surface was provided by Bill Ackman of Pershing Square fame, who called into CNBC and gave, without question, the worst-case scenario for the state of the world.  His degree of panic was palpable and frankly a bit overboard.  In all his doom and gloom, he also said he was buying selected stocks.  He called for the total shutdown of the country for 30 days.  I find that as I\u2019ve always said, \u201ceveryone is never right\u201d and EVERYONE is panicked.  Buy the fear, sell the greed works for me too.  Frankly, it scares me too, and that goes into the buy column.  Here\u2019s the Ackman call-in:  https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/18/bill-ackman-pleads-to-trump-to-increase-closures-to-save-the-economy-shut-it-down-now.html\n \nMy other issue is one that I\u2019ve railed about for months.  Buybacks.  If you had any doubt of the BS basis for buybacks, the last week should solve it.  Now that these companies have been buying stock and cutting their share count to inflate their earnings at the cost of (not the benefit of) shareholder.  The fact that most companies have cut off their buying is the giveaway.  The point of buybacks is to use your excess cash for the betterment of the firm.  At what point on the downside should you be buying stock back?  Any time that prices are depressed, and you can\u2019t find a better use for the cash.  This is EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT THE CORPORATIONS HAVE DONE. It shows their true intent, and it is disgraceful.  That\u2019s all I have to say about it, except that you can count on the massive class-action suits that will be brought.\n \n \n \nOur \u201copen forum\u201d on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.  It is informative and allows me to share insights as the market is open and moving.  The link is: https://discord.gg/ATvC7YZ  and I will be there and active from before the open and all day.  It\u2019s a great place to share ideas and gain some insights.\n \n \nSECTORS: Other names in the news: While there is plenty to discuss, I\u2019ll just hit a few high points.  All U.S. automakers closing production.  Marriott laying off workers and closing many hotels completely and in other floors.  Airlines cutting capacity. DAL which 10 days ago said 15%, upped it to 40%, now cutting 70%. Shelter in place expected in many major U.S. cities.  If you think it can\u2019t get worse, wait a few minutes.  But, as I said above, that\u2019s a time to buy, not sell.  \n \n \nBIOPHARMA: was LOWER with most falling sharply, and only gainers REGN +3.31 and VRTX +8.36 (3.97%).  IBB was $99.97 -1.33 (1.31%).\n \n \nCANNABIS: stocks aren\u2019t even worth reporting with losses from the best, GWPH only down 2.85 (3.42%) and the worst PYX -.65 (30.95%).  MJ $9.10 -.85 (8.54%).\n \n \nDEFENSE: was MOSTLY LOWER with LMT +20.17 (6.33%) and NOC +5.67 (1.78%) and TDY -58.88 (22.57%) the biggest loser.  ITA was $124.90 -12.15 (8.87%).\n \n \nRETAIL was MIXED with JWN +1.47 (7.85%), DDS +2.74 (7.39%), and WMT +5.44 (4.56%) and JCP -.08 (16.34%), and UAA -.97 (9.83%) the biggest loser.  XRT was $27.75 -2.39 (7.93%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were MIXED with GOOGL -26.87, AMZN +22.16, AAPL -6.19, FB -2.46, NFLX -4.28, NVDA -14.45, TSLA -68.98 (16.03%), BABA -4.81, BA -22.25 (17.92%), DIS -4.73 and XLK $76.35 -1.15 (1.48%).  This group was down much harder but rallied late and are higher in extended hours.\n \n \nFINANCIALS were LOWER with insurance stocks the worst.  TRV -14.41 (14.95%), AIG -2.80 (12.58%) the banks all down from 3 to 9%, and XLF $19.77 -1.20 (5.72%).\n \n \nOIL, $20.83 -6.50 The stocks were LOWER with the price of Oil trying to hold $24.00 and fell quickly on the break there touching $20.06.  XLE was $23.98 -4.02 (14.36%).  The oil rallied in extended hours and is currently $23.23 +2.40.\n \n \nMETALS, GOLD: $1,477.47.90 After the liquidation of the past few day\u2019s gold tried to work higher but gave it up when the oil cracked $24.00.  I still expect a move back toward $1,600 to unfold.  \n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $5340 -40. We broke to the downside overnight and fell to a low of $4390, and for the first time in days did not make a new recent low.  Today was another \u201cinside day\u201d which is generally indecisive. While I want to add the 350 sold just over a week ago, I want to wait and see some stabilization.  We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $6.01 -.09 today.\n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

        "selftext": "\nFor Trading March 12th\n \nBA CRASHES MARKET\n \nTRAVEL BUSINESSES COLLAPSE\n \nYields Improve\n \nToday\u2019s market was pounded from the start with the futures overnight falling on the lack of the president showing up after he said he would be appearing and the fact that there were no specifics of his \u201cplan\u201d to address the issues.  After trading down all morning to -1067 around 11:45 rates started to firm and we had a rally back to -787, but then rates slipped and we headed to 1665 before a close -1464.94 (5.86%), NASDAQ -382.20 (4.7%), S&amp;P 500 -140.86 (4.89%), the Russell -86.60 (6.41%) and the DJ Transports -394.75 (4.63%).  Clearly, the biggest drag on the market was BA -284 DP\u2019s, one of the reasons that the DJIA was a bigger percentage leader on the downside.  Market internals were weak with the NYSE 18:1 and the NASDAQ 7.1:1 negative.  All of the DJIA stocks were lower with only 2 NOT down in double digits.  Between the declaration that the WHO put out calling the COVID-19 a \u201cWorld-wide Pandemic,\u201d and the banning of spectators at sports events in Washington State and bans on events in San Francisco of over 1000 people, things only got worse when BA declared that it was taking down a $13.8 billion line of credit and a hiring freeze.  Since the close, the NCAA has said that March Madness games will also be played without spectators.  Even the late- night TV shows are stopping live audiences by this weekend.  The one thing that I feel I have to stress here is that this IS NOT A FINANCIAL CRISIS, IT IS A HEALTH CRISIS.  While that does little to take the sting out of a 20% decline, it is not a bank (or banks) failure.  I know it doesn\u2019t help, but it is the fact.  And frankly, the panic is overdone.\n \nOur \u201copen forum\u201d on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.

It\u2019s a great place to share ideas and gain some insights.\n \nSECTORS: Other names in the news: It was a debacle of a day for the same names as for the last 2 weeks with airlines, cruises, booking companies, and finally BA, the biggest aircraft manufacturer in the world falling.  In the airlines we had JBLU -1.01 (6.93%), UAL \u2013 3.22 (6.13%), LUV -307 (6.74%) and DAL -2.80 (6.16%).  The cruise lines continued with all down dramatically, but none as bad as NCLH today -5.47 (26.7%), CCL -2.27 (9.45%), and RCL -7.30 (14.13%).  The bookers followed with BKNG -116.50 (7.47%) and EXPE \u20139.26 (10.7%).  \n \nAs mentioned, BA gets a double (or maybe triple) shot with their 737MAX troubles, yesterday\u2019s issue with wiring bundles, the airlines canceling orders and the fact that they drew on a massive $13.8billion line of credit today.  The stock, the leader on the upside moving from $102 in 2016 to a peak of $446 last March has fallen back to 2017 levels, closing $189.08 -73.25 this week and -41.93 (18.15%) today.\n \n \nBIOPHARMA: was LOWER with none down less than 2.7% and BIIB -11.38, ABBV -2.53, REGN -10.32, ISRG -27.85, MYL -.58, TEVA -.35, VRTX -8.06, BHC -.61, INCY -2.41, ICPT -8.42 (9.29%), LABU -7.07 (18.72%) and IBB $107.70 -4.61 (4.10%).\n \nCANNABIS: stocks were LOWER again with TLRY -.69, CGC -.71, CRON -.03, GWPH -6.49, ACB -.09, PYX -.32, NBEV- .18, CURLF -.22 and the only winner KERN, maker of compliance software, 5.76 +.86 (17.55%) and MJ $11.34 -.80 (6.59%).\n \nDEFENSE: was SHARLY LOWER with -10.24, RTN -14.12, GD -6.85, TXT -3.85 (11.29%), UTX -11.71 (9.81%), NOC -17.04, BWXT -.34, TDY -15.98, and ITA $116.77 -16.54 (9.02%).\n \nRETAIL was LOWER with the brands only slightly better on the day.   M-.79, JWN -3.08 (11.36%), KSS -2.96, DDS -4.04, JCP -.068 (12.11%), WMT -4.81, TGT -2.75, TJX -2.36, RL -8.24, UAA -.37, LULU -10.38, TPR -1.59, CPRI -2.04 (9.97%), NKE -4.30 (4.87%) on Adidas earnings and guidance, and XRT $34.97 -2.70 (7.17%).\n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were LOWER with GOOGL -54.17, AMZN -57.62, AAPL -7.65, FB -6.64, NFLX -11.64, NVDA -12.39, IBM -5.51, TSLA \u20132.33, BABA -6.88, BIDU 2.51, BA (see above), CAT -5.80, DIS -5.27, and XLK $84.10 -3.54 (4.04%)\n \nFINANCIALS were LOWER with the market and a visit with the president didn\u2019t seem to help.  GS -10.10, JMP -3.93, BAC -.81, MS -2.30, MS -2.30, C -4.26, PNC -6.10, AIG -2.64, TRV -5.77, AXP -6.85 and XLF $23.00 -1.15 (4.76%).\n \n \nOIL, $3432.98 -1.38 The stocks were LOWER with the price of Oil trying to rally and making it to $36.35 before turning back down and closing near the lows.  I\u2019m still stand aside this market since it has a lot of work to do to rebuild a base to define the risk.  XLE finished $34.25 -1.30 (3.66%).\n \nMETALS, GOLD: $1,642 -13.80. After the rebound, and the overnight move to $1,704.30 we sold off as liquidation hit even the yellow metal.  We finished nearer the low, and we continued lower today.  \n \nBITCOIN: closed $7,855 -140. We broke to the downside overnight and fell to a low of $7,640, which closed a gap left on the breakout back in January.  While I want to add the 350 sold just over a week ago, I want to wait and see some stabilization.  We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06.

        "selftext": "Analyst day was largely as expected. It was encouraging to hear management reconfirm Q1 guidance, although sales may come in at the low end due to the coronavirus (not a surprise at this point). Most assume sales will pick back up in the 2H, so full year street estimates are unlikely to changing much from this event.\n\nAMD's pivot in GPU strategy from general-purpose GPUs to domain-specific GPUs seems like a smart move in adapting to the market evolution. The Radeon DNA will be optimized for gaming, while Compute DNA will be optimized for machine learning etc.\n\nAMD's market share gain story has been rewarding for shareholders, but the biggest push-back now is its valuation (\\~33x forward PE vs. \\~19x for peer group), leaving some to wonder if all the good news has been priced in. AMD will likely get a top-line boost in 2H from gaming console refresh, but this is a low margin business.\n\nAs the \"second horse\" in the declining PC market, AMD still needs to prove it has a long-term profitable business model. $INTC and $NVDA appear to be in better financial position to strengthen their positions in both CPU and GPU markets. AMD chasing the low-margin gaming business could hinder its ability to improve profitability.",

        "selftext": "Good morning. Here's my watch list for today\n\nGap ups: AHPI, APT, CEMI (over 200 pre market highs), CODX, INO, LAKE, TVIX/UVXY\n\nGap downs: ALC, AXSM, CRWD, ETSY, LK, NVDA, QRVO, TQQQ, TSLA, TTD, UBER\n\nMost likely we hit a limit down and circuit breakers kick in. Here's the levels: \n\n* **Level 1:** A drop of 7% from the prior day's closing price of the S&amp;P 500 triggers a 15-minute trading halt. Trading is not halted if the drop occurs at or after 3:25 p.m. ET.\n* **Level 2:** A drop of 13% triggers a 15-minute halt. Trading is not halted if the drop occurs at or after 3:25 p.m. ET.\n* **Level 3:** A drop of 20% triggers a halt for the rest of the trading day, and trading resumes the following day.\n\nWith that being said, pay attention to the market action if you do not want to get stuck in any halts. Spy is sitting on 200 DMA on weekly chart, we will have to see if this holds. Patience is your friend in these markets. Volatility is here and it will be here for a while to come. Not an ideal market for newer traders. Try not to look at the negative aspects, this is a good learning experience if you are studying and paying attention. Take the opportunity to do so. If you aren't an active trader, trade with small risk, trade paper, or watch. There will be better days when trading is more favorable. I will be focusing on TQQQ mostly due to the range. Good luck and be careful out there.",

Medtronic just got under 100 dollars, Stryker is plummeting, I see it as good news to finally get in soon on these stocks. I work in the operating room and the doctors I work with(mostly orthopedics/neurosurgeons) always bragging about when they got in on medtronic, Stryker, smith and nephew, etc. I bet they aren\u2019t liking their numbers right now. Keep on going down and I will be right there with you boys! So I guess what I am saying is to slowly trickle shares in when these companies are low, and if they go lower, o well, buy more!

        "selftext": "I have been so fortunate that I have been all cash during this turbulent time. I'm currently studying and I have around 8k USD cash to invest for and the money is not needed any time soon. So, \"timing\" the market and going all in is a no-go. I want to buy x percent of stock, every y amount of days/weeks/months and keep doing that until i run out of cash to invest.\n\nI am a bit in doubts of the timespan and the amount to buy every time. First, I am a bit of pessimistic about the economy and I think it may have more consequences in the long term. So, if I buy 20% every week, I will have invested over 5 weeks and if I expect a bigger dip, let's say when Q3 are released etc., I wouldn't really spread my investment that well. So, I am open for a discussion on what YOU would do, if you were in my situation. The US stock indexes are generally more performant than the European ones, but since I am buying on a European broker there is a significant brokerage fee per time I buy (like 10-15 usd), which is not that relevant, but if I buy like for 200 USD every 2 days or something, then it adds up. So the frequency won't be less than a week imo. I am not interested in investing in oil, tobacco and that sorts of companies.\n\nI know this isn't an exact science and in the end probably doesn't matter too much, but still. At the moment I am thinking of something like  \n\n\n25% every 2 weeks =&gt; so in two months I am \"all in\". Stuff like Google, Apple, Tesla etc. (maybe not Tesla, I don't now). Or should I consider an even longer entry strategy?  \nI can also consider big european stocks like Volkswagen or stuff like that. if someone's into tech, hmu with some cool companies. Two years ago I managed a 100% yield, by buying NVIDIA for example.   \n\n\nI open up the discussion and also individual stocks you think would be cool and I'll take a look :-)",

PATRICK\u2019S DAY!!\n \nI can\u2019t believe that I had to search around to find a restaurant that was open for me to pick up dinner since I wasn\u2019t spending any time in a grocery store to buy the ingredients.  \n \nToday\u2019s market was the first day that we had any real \u201chorizontal\u201d action, and frankly, it was a much calmer day.  We had a day that was higher at the open, fell back to -200 or so, but then something different happened, it went back to the plus side.  Here\u2019s the video I did this evening: https://youtu.be/coWMsic-3xU .  Unfortunately, I also did one on the Oil, which concerns me since it looks to me as if it may be setting up for another down leg.  But for the day, we were higher across the board with DJIA +1048.86 (5.2%), NASDAQ +430.19 (6.23%), S&amp;P 500 +143.05 (6%), the Russell +69.09 (6.66%), and the DJ Transports +444.79 (6.33%).  Market internals were also tame (disappointing) with NYSE a subdued 1.5:1 up and the Naz. only slightly better at 2:1. The DJIA was 27:3 with only 4 single digit movers and, surprisingly only 1 triple-digit gainer, UNH +130DPs.  The biggest loser, as usual, was BA -40DPs.  \n \n \nOur \u201copen forum\u201d on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.  It is informative and allows me to share insights as the market is open and moving.  The link is: https://discord.gg/ATvC7YZ  and I will be there and active from before the open and all day.  It\u2019s a great place to share ideas and gain some insights.\n \n \nSECTORS: Other names in the news: The news of the FED commercial paper facility was helpful, but the fall in retail sales was a disappointment and the direct payment to taxpayers or tax cuts helped, but Mayor De Blasio\u2019s comments about residents going to \u201cshelter in place\u201d status, like San Francisco, was not taken well.  Energy concerns and defensiveness that is unknowable at this point sent MAR \u2013 11.18 (12.9%) as it started to furlough workers.  DKS -2.59 (12.22%) got several downgrades in price objectives and after touching just under $40 last week on earnings has fallen all the way toward being a teenager at $18.60.  Housing starts, building permits and mortgage applications come tomorrow.  \n \n \nBIOPHARMA: was HIGHER with most rising only slightly, and the major multipoint gainer being REGN +56.17 (12.74%), BIIB +23.60 (8.38%), ABBV -2.32, ISRG +21.19, MYL +.22, TEVA +.19, VRTX +1.83, BHC -.76, INCY -1.23, ICPT +1.45, LABU +.18, and IBB $100.01 +5.62 (5.95%).\n \n \nCANNABIS: stocks were MIXED with TLRY -.11, CGC -.23, CRON -.26, GWPH, the big gainer, +9.52 (13.13%), ACB +.01, PYX +.23, NBEV +.05, CURLF -.17, KERN +.54 (12.98%), and MJ $9.95 +.51 (5.4%).\n \n \nDEFENSE: was MIXED with LMT +22.06, RTN -4.58, GD +1.20, TXT +1.20, UTX +1.04, NOC +27.41 (9.7%), BWXT -1.11, TDY +6.02, and ITA $133 -1.18 (.88%).\n \n \nRETAIL was MIXED with M-.31, JWN +1.17, KSS -2.40, DDS +2.24, JCP -.07 (12.28%), WMT +10.42 (9.76%), TGT +7.21 (7.69%), TJX unch., RL +1.91, UAA -.12, LULU +5.02, TPR +1.62 (14.11%), CPRI -1.69 (17.49%) and XRT $30.14 +1.48 (5.16%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were HIGHER with GOOGL +45.06, AMZN +76.85, AAPL +1.79, FB -2.01, NFLX +11.16, NVDA +14.60, IBM +1.92, TSLA -37.50, BABA +3.21, BIDU -2.51, BA -17.31, CAT +1.60, DIS -3.76, and XLK 76.35 +3.79 (5.22%).\n \n \nFINANCIALS were MIXED with GS -.66, JPM +2.54, BAC +.69, MS +1.35, C -1.96, PNC +3.03, AIG -1.25, TRV +7.90, AXP -2.87 and XLF $20.20 +.31 (1.56%).\n \n \nOIL, $26.95 \u20131.75 The stocks were LOWER with the price of Oil trying to hold $30.00 initially but turning back down and breaking $29.00. This puts it back near the 2016 lows just under $27.00. Today\u2019s move to below $27.00 is ominous. XLE finished $28.00 +.19 (.68%). Today\u2019s Video  https://youtu.be/D4QXK21NMAs\n \nMETALS, GOLD: $1,1525.80 +39.30. After the liquidation of the past few day\u2019s gold worked its way higher today.  I expect a move back toward $1,600 to unfold.  \n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $5,380 +450. We broke to the downside overnight and fell to a low of $4390, and for the first time in days did not make a new recent low.  Today was another \u201cinside day\u201d which is generally indecisive. While I want to add the 350 sold just over a week ago, I want to wait and see some stabilization.  We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $6.10 +.56 today.\n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

        "selftext": "\nFor Trading March 17th\n \nMarkets Halted Again\nFED Move Fails to Help\n \nYields Steady\n \nToday\u2019s market was pounded from the start with the futures overnight falling to down \u201cthe limit\u201d prior to our open and were halted almost immediately.  We came close to the second halt, but the market stabilized, sort of, and traded without much enthusiasm until Mr. Trump started to speak, and that took us to a new low of the day at -1050 or so.  For a while it looked as if we\u2019d also see a new all-time loss on the NASDAQ 2hich looked like it would go -1000, but rallied a touch to close -970.29 (12.32%), DJIA -2997.11 (12.93%), SP 500 -324.90 (11.98%), the Russell -171.66 (14.2%) and the DJ Transports -916.76 (11.55%).  Market internals were not quite as bad as the decline would project with NYSE A/D 24:1 and NASDAQ 11:1, but the DJIA was a debacle with all stocks lower and the biggest losers being UNH -317DPs, HD-275, BA -274, AAPL -242, MCD-190, V -162, and MSFT -158.  In fact, 10 of the 30 were down triple digits while only 1, WBA was down a single digit.  The Fed\u2019s dramatic 1% rate cut down to .25% did little to calm fears as did their open market infusions during the day.  The White House did little to engender any confidence, and their lack of any cohesive fiscal plans left the futures \u201climit down\u201d from early last evening right up to the open, which lasted only a minute, literally, before level 1 circuit breakers halted the market for 15 minutes.  We came very close to the second breakers at -13%, but the market seemed to calm down a bit and while trading included more forced liquidation, but the decline was stopped at -2798 by 10:00 (including the 15 minute halt) and we rallied until topping out at 11:30 at -1417.  The rest of the day was uneventful until Trump started speaking and we sold off into the close with a new point loss record.  Briefing.com listed NO STRONG groups for the 3rd time in 3 days with the weakest including Info tech, financials, consumer discretionary, materials, real estate and of course, energy.\n \nOur \u201copen forum\u201d on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.

It\u2019s a great place to share ideas and gain some insights.\n \nSECTORS: Other names in the news: I\u2019m not sure that there is really any point to listing all the names and declines here so I\u2019m just going to hit the groups and highlight any outstanding issues.  But the main characteristic of this market is forced liquidation.  Whether for margin calls, or recently new investors throwing in the towel and leaving the market, it\u2019s pretty extreme.  As I\u2019ve said here before, the rallies in a bear market can be very deceptive.  Sharp and quick and with high volume, sucking you back in because everyone wants to believe the turn is here.\n \n \nBIOPHARMA: was LOWER with most down nearly 10% and the only multipoint gainer being REGN +4.45.  On the downside we had BIIB -21.71, ABBV -9.06 (10.16%), ISRG -66.69 (14.16%), MYL +.13, TEVA -.99 (11.79%), VRTX -21.09 (9.55%), BHC -3.48 (18.51%), INCY -2.34, ICPT -16.81 (23.41%), LABU -8.10 (33.37%) and IBB $95.90 -7.78 (7.5%).\n \nCANNABIS: stocks were LOWER again and it\u2019s almost a waste to discuss the group, which is severely broken with TLRY, a former $300 stock that has fallen for 14 of the last 16 days from $20 to close today $3.05 -.875 (21.74%).  Even the medical company CURLF was $3.20 -.48 (12.83%) and KERN the compliance software $4.16 -.91 (17.95%) and MJ $9.54 -.80 (7.74%).\n \nDEFENSE: was SHARPLY LOWER with most down double digits LMT -33.08, RTN -16.29, GD -12.94, TXT -2.22, UTX -13.37, NOC -31.00, BWXT -3.79, TDY -37.18, and ITA $134.25 -23.12 (14.69%).\n \nRETAIL was LOWER with all down double-digit percentages. M -1.16 (14.45%), JWN -4.40 (20.38%), and on the brand side, TPR (COACH) -4.23 (26.06%), and CPRI (KORS), -4.27 (30.65%) and XRT $28.66 -4.08 (12.46%).\n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were LOWER with this group the highlight of the crowded trade problems.  GOOGL \u2013 129.27, AMZN -40, AAPL -27.97 (10%), FB -21.28 (12.5%), NFLX-30.30 (after making a 52-wk high @393, 10 days ago and 95 higher), NVDA -34.94, IBM -5.71, TSLA -93.62, BABA -12.41, BIDU -8.84, BA -37.34, CAT -2.66, DIS -5.41, and XLK $72.56 -11.63 (13.81%).\n \nFINANCIALS were SHARPLY LOWER with the market and the FEDs big rate cut didn\u2019t seem to help.  GS \u201318.60, JPM -13.16, BAC -3.28, MS -4.66 (after Cramer \u201csanctioned the purchase\u201d last Tuesday at $37 ($6 ago), C -8.79, PNC -17.01, AIG -3.44, TRV -20.94 (19.49%), AXP -8.67, and XLF $20.35 -2.70 (11.71%).\n \n \nOIL, $28.70 -3.04 The stocks were LOWER with the price of Oil trying to hold $30.00 initially but turning back down and breaking $29.00. This puts it back near the 2016 lows just under $27.00. XLE finished $27.81 -4.38 (13.61%).\n \nMETALS, GOLD: $1,486.50 -30.20. After the overnight rally on the Fed news the Gold fell along with the S&amp;P, and other indexes.  Gold is clearly suffering through liquidation like the rest of the market, but the FED repo program should stoke the inflation fires, and any bounce in stocks will help.  \n \nBITCOIN: closed $4930 -400. We broke to the downside overnight and fell to a low of $4390, and for the first time in days did not make a new recent low.  While I want to add the 350 sold just over a week ago, I want to wait and see some stabilization.  We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $5.44 -.73 today.\n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

        "selftext": "This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.\nThe SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.

        "selftext": "\nFor Trading March 11th\n \nAnother Day, Another 5%\n \nYields Improve\n \nToday\u2019s market was interesting in that after it opened higher and was +945 within the first 15 minutes, and fell back to down on the day by 11:45, it actually made a slight new low vs. yesterday\u2019s debacle and survived, spent 3 hours consolidating, and then started up again making a new high on the day and closing on that high with DJIA +1167.14 (4.89%), NASDAQ +393.57 (4.95%), S&amp;P 500 +4.94%), the Russell +37.47 (2.85%) and the DJ Transports +437.35 (5.41%).  The transports were the only index that had an \u201cinside\u201d day, while all the others made the lower low and finished at or near the highs.  While I don\u2019t believe that the market is turning on a dime and heading higher, today\u2019s action is constructive in that it is displaying the kind of action that occurs in a \u201cbottoming\u201d area.  The gap, followed by the selloff, and recovery to new highs for the day was impressive.  Market internals improved (it would have been hard for them not to) with NYSE A/D at 3:1 and the NASDAQ was 2:1.  Volume was good in both places and the DJIA was the mirror image of yesterday with all 30 names higher.  The biggest gainers were AAPL +130, HD +103, MCD +88 and GS +77DPs.  There were only 3 stocks up less than double digits.  These gains may not look very impressive when compared to yesterday\u2019s losses, but what you need to remember is that on the downside, there need not be big sellers to depress prices.  The absence of buyers and the gaps down take little volume, while buying, in the face of depressed prices takes substantially greater conviction.  This is one of the reasons that the market goes up roughly 2/3 of the time and falls twice as fast.\n \nOur \u201copen forum\u201d on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.  It is informative and allows me to share insights as the market is open and moving.  The link is: https://discord.gg/ATvC7YZ  and I will be there and active from before the open and all day.  It\u2019s a great place to share ideas and gain some insights.\n \nSECTORS: Other names in the news: It was a decent day for an earnings report for DKS.  They beat on every metric and raised the dividend, and then in a display of public awareness disclosed that they are discontinuing hunting and gun sales.  While the stock is down from $50 to $32 in January, today\u2019s actions took it back as high as $39.14 and finished $35.87 +1.39 (4.03%).\n \nI want to take the time tonight to remind everyone that there have been a lot of companies that have made claims, or had claims made about them that have caused some major moves.  Some were warranted and some were not, but the point is that as a rule, they are dangerous unless you use stops and go into them with the knowledge that they can and do turn on a dime.\n \nHere are a few:\nINO  Started $4.00 went to $19, closed @$5.70 -4.13 today.\nSPEX  $1.03 to $3.75, back to .75, back to $5.50, closed today $1.83 -1.39 today\nOPK   $1.40 to $2.91, closed today $1.71 -.51\nAnd CODX $3.16 to $21.75, back to $8, back to $18, closed $6.89 -2.94 today.\n \nBIOPHARMA: was HIGHER with BIIB +1.81, ABBV +2.17, REGN +.58, ISRG +26.74 (5.24%), MYL +.70, TEVA +.28, VRTX +5.35, BHC +1.10, INCY +1.71, ICPT +5.47, LABU +1.82 and IBB $112.15 +2.15 (1.95%).\n \nCANNABIS: stocks were HIGHER with TLRY +.09, CGC +.80, CRON +.15, GWPH +5.79, ACB +.04, PYX +.01, NBEV + .13, CURLF +.21, KERN +.43 and MJ $12.14 +.39 (3.32%).\n \nDEFENSE: was HIGHER with LMT +8.47, RTN +4.89, GD +5.28, TXT +3.06, UTX +2.14, NOC +21.61 (6.9%), BWTX +2.72, TDY +11.92, and ITA $186.29 +9.95 (5.64%).\n \nRETAIL was LOWER with the brands were the biggest winners on the day.   M-.24, JWN +.32, KSS -1.50, JCP -.01, WMT +.59, TGT +1.98, TJX -.20, RL +3.92, UAA +.75, LULU +2.23, TPR +.62, CPRI +.66, and XRT $37.67 +.66 (1.78%).\n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were HIGHER with GOOGL +24.21, AMZN +56.55, AAPL +13.33, FB +5.22, NFLX +10.51, NVDA +9.76, IBM +5.69, TSLA +17.30, BABA +7.20, BIDU +3.35, BA -2.37, CAT +.43, DIS +4.86, and XLK $87.64 +5.48 (6.67%).\n \nFINANCIALS were HIGHER with the market and firming in rates with GS +7.19, JPM +5.11, BAC +1.08, MS +1.14, C +2.68, PNC +9.29, AIG +2.26, TRV +2.30, AXP +3.96 and XLF $23.77 +.96 (4.21%).\n \nOIL, $34.36 +3.23%) The stocks were HIGHER with the steadying of the Oil price and the overall market.  I\u2019m still stand aside this market since it has a lot of work to do to rebuild a base to define the risk.  XLE finished $34.79 +.85 (2.5%).\n \nMETALS, GOLD: $1,660.30 -15.40. After the rebound, and the overnight move to $1,704.30 we sold off as liquidation hit even the yellow metal.  We finished nearer the low, and I feel like after a consolidation that we will head higher.\n \nBITCOIN: closed $7,995 +145. We broke to the downside overnight and fell to a low of $7,640, which closed a gap left on the breakout back in January.  While I want to add the 350 sold just over a week ago, I want to wait and see some stabilization.  We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $9.27 +40 today.\n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

        "selftext": " \n\nHi All,\n\nWe have the potential for a \"Follow Through Day\" this week, which is a gain in one of the major indexes of over 1% with volume greater than the previous trading session. This must happen on the 4th day or later of a rally to be eligible. This is a CANSLIM strategy to get you in as close to a potential bottom while minimizing risk.\n\nAfter a Follow through day you want to slowly scale in to market leaders, stocks showing excellent technical price performance relative to the indexes. At this point any stocks over their 30 and 50 day moving averages and near their prior highs are showing considerable relative strength. This price action suggest that institutions are keeping their large positions in them and potentially buying more.\n\nHere is my focus list for the upcoming trading week:\n\n[$AMD](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMD&amp;src=cashtag_click) [$EHTH](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24EHTH&amp;src=cashtag_click) [$SAFE](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SAFE&amp;src=cashtag_click) [$DOCU](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24DOCU&amp;src=cashtag_click) [$NVDA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24NVDA&amp;src=cashtag_click) [$TAL](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TAL&amp;src=cashtag_click) [$NET](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24NET&amp;src=cashtag_click) [$TEAM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TEAM&amp;src=cashtag_click) [$CHWY](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CHWY&amp;src=cashtag_click)\\* [$DXCM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24DXCM&amp;src=cashtag_click) [$PLMR](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24PLMR&amp;src=cashtag_click) [$ZM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ZM&amp;src=cashtag_click) [$GSX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GSX&amp;src=cashtag_click) [$TDOC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TDOC&amp;src=cashtag_click) [$COE](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24COE&amp;src=cashtag_click) [$FIVN](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FIVN&amp;src=cashtag_click) [$RNG](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24RNG&amp;src=cashtag_click)\n\nAs the CANSLIM methodology goes, all of these are showing great technical strength as well as Earnings growth, Sales Growth, Margins Growth, ROE...

        "selftext": "\nFor Trading March 27th\n \nHIGHER AGAIN\n \nBA Drives the DJIA, Again\nDJIA +4339 Off Low\n24% Off Monday\u2019s Low\n \nToday was another blockbuster of a day, and while I didn\u2019t expect it, clearly, I seemed to be in the minority.  Everything that I have learned over the many years of participation in the market\u2019s tells me that this is not sustainable.  Even with the dramatic influx of money from all the central banks can not possibly keep this going for any period of time.  The health of any country is built on its currency and when you generate the kind of deficits that we are creating, there is a bill to pay.  While we have a leader whose answer to over leveraging a business is bankruptcy, it does little to engender stability.  Those are my thoughts.  Now on to what happened today.  Futures were mostly lower all night and early this morning they started to turn to the upside.  By the time we opened, the S&amp;P had moved from 2402 to 2550.  Of course, by then, Fed Chairman Powell had made a successful appearance on the Today Show, telling the public that the Fed \u201cwould not run out of ammunition.  After hitting 2575 we fell back $40 or so we moved up to the 2600 level by noon and then fell back another 60 to 2540.  But by 2:50 we had made another new high at 2625, and we spent the rest of the day and this evening between 2600 and 2625.  At the close the DJIA was +1351.62 (6.36%), NASDAQ +413.34 (5.6%), S&amp;P 500 +154.51 (6.24%), the Russell +69.98 (6.3%) and the DJ Transports +320.60 (4.15%).  Market internals were NYSE 6:1 and NASDAQ 4.8:1 while volume was lighter than the past several days.  All 30 DJIA stocks were higher with the leader\u2019s BA +148 and UNH +142 DP\u2019s.\nHere is the link to tonight\u2019s link to my closing comment:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH7NlMsLJvc&amp;t=127s\n \nOur \u201copen forum\u201d on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.  It is informative and allows me to share insights as the market is open and moving.  The link is: https://discord.gg/ATvC7YZ  and I will be there and active from before the open and all day.  It\u2019s a great place to share ideas and gain some insights, and we\u2019ve grown to almost 800 members.\n \n \nSECTORS: Other names in the news: Since it\u2019s late, I\u2019m going to deliver a quick and to the point summation of the sectors.\n \n \nBIOPHARMA: was HIGHER with ABBV +6.23 (9.17%), ISRG +40.69 (8.84%), REGN +30.22 (7.03%), ICPT +5.69 (9.18%) and the IBB was $106.79 +4.79 (4.7%).\n \n \nCANNABIS: This group finally caught a bid yesterday on the news that several reported big jumps in revenues in California and today had a bout of short covering that drove prices dramatically higher with TLRY + 3.21 (64%), CGC +1.05 (7.51%), CRON +.77 (13.68%), GWPH -1.91, ACB _.29 (39%), PYX +.59 (21.22%), NBEV +.21 (16.28%), CURLF +.49 (14.16%), KERN +.86 (17.06%) and MJ $12.11 +1.11 (10.09%).\n \n \nDEFENSE: was HIGHER with none up less than 5% and several gainers like LMT +30.33 (9.48%), RTN +11.91 (8.32%), GD +12.38 (10.15%), TXT +3.18 (12.22%), UTX +8.57 (8.91%), NOC +32.64 (11.32%), BWXT +4.23 (9.45%), TDY +14.84 (5.17%), and ITA $162.00 +17.43 (12.06%).\n \n \nRETAIL was MIXED with the retailers lower but the brands all higher.  Only the discounters were higher with WMT +.55, TGT +4.96 (5.45%), TJX +3.77 (8.55%) and RL +4.40 (6.3%), UAA +.36 (3.88%), LULU +2.33 (1.2%) and XRT $31.20 +.94 (3.11%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were HIGHER with GOOGL +61.38, AMZN +68.16, AAPL +13.41, FB +7.29, NFLX +19.86, NVDA +12.28, TSLA -12.25, BABA +6.79, BIDU +4.98, BA +26.27 (16.55%), CAT +5.83, DIS +4.68 and XLK $82.31 +4.80 (6.19%).\n \nFINANCIALS were HIGHER with PNC +11.95 (12.98%) and C +4.36 (10.42%) and XLF $21.67 +1.28 (6.28%).\n \n \nOIL, $22.60 -1.89. The stocks were HIGHER even with the price of Oil trading down 7%, but the stocks trading with the overall market.  MRO was the big winner+.46 (12.85%), MPC +2.09 (9.9%) and XLE $30.39 +1.75 (6.11%).\n \n \nMETALS, GOLD: $1,651.20 +17.80 After the selloff yesterday and last night the Gold moved higher on the words of Fed Chairman Powell on the Today Show telling the interviewer that the Fed would not run \u201cout of ammunition\u201d to help with the relief money and the whatever is needed to help the economy.\n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $6675 + 45. We traded in another short range again today and finished mid-range on the day. While I want to add the 350 sold just over a week ago, I want to wait and see some stabilization.  We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $7.41 +.06 today.\n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

        "selftext": "You think Trump is gonna allow the economy to call per months before election? Fuck no, he will do anything and everything in the book, illegal or legal to save this ship. If he doesn\u2019t, he risks losing. I think he will emulate China in liquidating tons of cash in the market and downplaying the virus. I see a few Green Day\u2019s before the market inevitably corrects just like how it took a while for it to collapse this go round after China played dirty. This is the one time every powerful human agrees, fuck corona virus because it fucks with our ability to achieve our agenda. Media might just downplay it for a while to help out their billionaire buddies. Finally, the CDC has always talked about disease \u201cx\u201d. This is a disease that kills 80 mil people. Let\u2019s be honest, those numbers will be heavily skewed towards countries with bad infrastructure and bad healthcare. Essentially, poor countries will account for a vast majority of deaths, and old/compromised people will make up the rest. This is a correction due to every stock being over valued and at all time highs. Look at a 180 day candlestick chart, they all look the same, every company. All time highs, to massive drops to 180day to 1yr averages. I think the prices will drive buyers plus the realization that this won\u2019t truly effect us regardless if it hits max potential. Sorry this was so long I\u2019m fucking smacked boys.  And boys don\u2019t just buy calls or puts, if you have the capital sell a put, easy premium. Make the smart play, if you think it\u2019s gonna trend down, buy puts, up? Buy calls. Not sure? Spread. Have a tool bag of plays to use like a ducking plumber. The hammer don\u2019t work for everything, sometimes you need the wrench, or the screwdriver. As long as you diversify your plays to fit the situation, you can trade the same stock all the time. For example, I trust AMD and bought calls all year, then I waited and sold puts way otm for fat premium and cashed out. Meanwhile I bought puts and tenderized theta gang. Then Friday I thought it was all gonna go green, I went gainer my dd and bought $INTC calls expiring this Friday. Down like 50% on those contracts. Not only did it not go up, I bought it the second it was up when the cost was at its highest by a stupid amount. Played myself and hate my self for getting greedy. Pray for bull market Monday. \n\nTLDR: Buy cheap calls on shit like $TSLA, $AMZN, $AMD, $NVDA, $LULU, literally anything that is stupid cheap now. A lot of shit went green Friday and could be a song of upturn.",

        "selftext": "\nFor Trading March 24th\n \nAnother Range Day\n \nYields Fall\n \nOil Rebounds\n \n \nLast week I said that \u201ctoday\u2019s market was actually not as bad as it seemed.\u201d  And today while we had a sharp decline it feels to me that were have a slowing rate of decline and some good trading action, that we are setting up for a tradable rally.  Here\u2019s my closing comments video from this evening:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cj7UI1dvLNk   Market internals were improved with A/D on NYSE 3.5:1 and NASDAQ 1.5:1, and volume slowed slightly.  We actually had a few Strong sectors, Consumer discretionary and Communication services while the weakest were (guess what) Energy and financials.  The DJIA was 26 down, 4 up with no triple-digit winners or losers and BA the big gainer +72 DPs and HD +69, and the biggest losers MCD -77, UNH -70, JNJ -60, UTX -51, and MMM -48 DP\u2019s.  BA was up after a trading halt for news at which they announced they were suspending all production at the Seattle facility.  Semi\u2019s (the chips not the trucks) were also higher by 3.4% and as I mentioned consumer discretionary was higher, but only by .4%.  The FED continues to prime the pump with as much cash as they can get into the market.  Neel Kashkari, ex-Goldman Sachs, brought on by Henry Paulson as an aide, and part of the TARP team, is now President of the Minneapolis Fed since January 1, 2016 and was on CNBC this morning, said that the Fed has the power to keep adding liquidity with as much as and whenever they feel it is needed.\n \n \nOur \u201copen forum\u201d on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.  It is informative and allows me to share insights as the market is open and moving.  The link is: https://discord.gg/ATvC7YZ  and I will be there and active from before the open and all day.  It\u2019s a great place to share ideas and gain some insights, and we\u2019ve grown to almost 800 members.\n \n \nSECTORS: Other names in the news: Last night, Inovio Pharmaceuticals was highlighted on a 60 Minutes story that would have made you think that they were the best buy in creation, but INO, which moved from $3.00 to a high of $19.36 in a week earlier this month had fallen back to close $7.22 opened up .22 today but finished $6.62 -.60 (8.31%).  Very disappointing.\n \n \nBIOPHARMA: was MIXED with MYL and TEVA the big winners.  MYL was +1.25 (8.2%) and TEVA +.53 (7.29%) after the news Thursday that it is a manufacturer of Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate, a potential treatment for COVID-19 and are donating the tablets to hospitals nationwide.  REGN, also in the COVID-19 space was +27.55 (6.28%) and IBB $97.50 -.54 (.55%).\n \n \nCANNABIS: Even this group had some winners with TLRY +.35, CGC +.85, CRON -.32, GWPH +3.51, ACB -.02, PYX -.18, NBEV -.03, CURLF +.30, KERN +.04 and MJ $9.71 -.01 (.10%).\n \n \nDEFENSE: was MIXED with LMT -8.61, RTN -7.18, GD -4.99, TXT unchanged, UTX -4.83, NOC -10.02, BWXT +.46, TDY +.74 and ITA $120.95 +.20 (.17%).\n \n \nRETAIL was MUCH LOWER with M -1.06 (17.61%), JWN -2.07 (11.59%), KSS -2.35 (14.83%), DDS -6.35 (15.15%), JCP -.034 (7.84%), WMT +2.52, TGT +.40, TJX +.13 LULU the only winner in the brands +12.84 (7.78%), TPR -1.24 (10.3%), CPRI -.65 (6.59%) and XRT $26.99 -.80 (2.86%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were MOSTLY HIGHER with GOOGL +379, AMZN +76.91, AAPL -4.87, FB -1.63, NFLX + 27.44, NVDA +6.94, IBM -.63, TSLA +6.76, BABA -6.12, BIDU +3.79, BA +10.61, CAT -3.65, DIS -.22 and XLK $71.85 +.80 (1.13%).\n \n \nFINANCIALS were LOWER with GS -.91, JPM -2.43, BAC -1.14, MS -.84, C -1.64, PNC -6.99 (7.81%), AIG +.07, TRV -1.01, AXP -3.33, and XLF $17.66 -1.09 (5.82%).\n \n \nOIL, $23.36 +.73. The stocks were LOWER with the price of Oil trading up slightly but the stocks trading with the overall market.  BP was the only big gainer +1.23 (7.07%) and the XLE $24.05 +1.25 (4.92%).\n \n \nMETALS, GOLD: $1,567.60. After the liquidation of the past few week\u2019s gold made a higher low and broke through resistance at $1,520 and rallied hard right through $1,540 and up towards $1,575.  I still expect a move back toward $1,600 to unfold.  \n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $6340 +90. We broke to the downside overnight and fell to a low of $4390, and for the first time in days did not make a new recent low.  Today was a strong move to the upside While I want to add the 350 sold just over a week ago, I want to wait and see some stabilization.  We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $7.19 +.19 today.\n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

        "selftext": "Just some ramblings from a 59 year old investor. Been through this in 87 and 2008 and it's the same every time. The world as we know it is ending, the rules for investing have changed, the paradigm has shifted, etc.... and we're all F'd. Yesterday the volume was huge and everything was getting kicked to the curb, in all categories, even gold and crypto. That's the definition of panic. Throwing out the babies with the bathwater. I was sitting on cash but putting it to work now. Started buying in at -15% and have been cost average buying every 5% pts down. I'm about 2/3's done. Bought heavily at the close yesterday and wanted to puke the whole time and my inner dialogue was telling me what a moron I am. Yesterday had all the symptoms of capitulation when we were down 27% peak to trough, but I think we'll end up down 30-35% all totaled before this is over, so there will be plenty of buy opportunities over the next few weeks. From there we may bounce around in a short lived bear market that traders will like. Not quite the existential financial crisis of 2008 but close. Loading up on MSFT, DIS, CSCO, AAPL, BAC, CVS, SBUX, MA, VZ, T, MU, STX, NKE etc... and plan to hold for 10+ year timeline. When this is over, interest rates will be at zero and people have to put their money somewhere for any kind of yield. If you got caught in this downdraft and you're at the point now where the pain is kicking your ass and you're tempted to sell... I gave in and did that in 2008 and when I reverse engineer if I had just done nothing and just shut my computer, I would have doubled my money in the following 5-7 years. Remember, nearly everyone you see commenting on CNBC and every article you read from the so called experts, all have a position to protect and every word they speak is in service of protecting that position/gameplan.",
