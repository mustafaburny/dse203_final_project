        "selftext": "As a new investor I would like to get some opinions from some of the savvy folks out there. \n\nI recently pulled about half of my money out of the stock market as COVID cases started increasing in America. I know that the death rate will start to dramatically increase in a week or two as a result. With the increased death rate I'm expecting the market to take a negative turn and hence why I pulled half my money out. \n\nAm I getting cold feet or am I right to take this precautionary approach? Planning on buying during the dip (if there is one).\n\nCurrently still invested in MFST, AMD and ZM but sold on BABA (..fuck me), DIS, CRNC, SNPS and ALB.",

Both companies have been around for decades and have large semiconductors as their clients. With all the noise around 5G, AI and IoT, each company should benefit big time. Which stock would you bet on?",
