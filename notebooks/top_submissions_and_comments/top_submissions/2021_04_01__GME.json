        "selftext": "&gt;GameStop disclosed on April 5, 2021 that it had filed a prospectus supplement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to offer and sell up to a maximum of 3,500,000 shares of its common stock from time to time through the ATM Offering. The Company ultimately sold 3,500,000 shares of common stock and generated aggregate gross proceeds before commissions and offering expenses of approximately $551,000,000. Net proceeds will be used to continue accelerating GameStop\u2019s transformation as well as for general corporate purposes and further strengthening the Company\u2019s balance sheet.\n\nThis is amazing news. GME sold 3.5 mil shares at ~$157 to raise 550 mil. The company has zero debt and now has signicant money to fund their transformation moving forward. Stock is currently up 12% in AH, reaching $190. GME is now primed for another run and the highly anticipated short squeeze. \n\n[https://gamestop.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-completes-market-equity-offering-program](https://gamestop.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-completes-market-equity-offering-program)",

Last time I posted about TA was on $RKT and my price target hit on the dot (I was shocked too lol). This time I was looking at the GME Chart and I noticed something very interesting.\n\n\\- Currently we are breaking out of a descending triangle to the upside and the price target for that is 348$\n\n\\- I then noticed if we hit the price target of 348$ we are creating a W pattern which has a higher high base. The realistic price target of the W pattern would be 476$ but a 560$ could happen as well!\n\n\\- Currently volume overall in MA deviation rate, MACD and the volume bars is very low and stable which indicates a rise in Volume and Volatility soon. This can link to the fact that we are breaking out of a descending triangle.\n\n\\- Soon enough with George Sherman stepping down as Chief Executive we can hope the next candidate can sustain GME as a company better than Sherman did.\n\n\\- Last but not least, I have to mention the breakout to the downside price target which is 40$ however I think it is highly unlikely for that scenario to play out.\n\nPlease have a look at my TA in the screenshot, I've labeled each indication for you apes to see something other than crayons.\n\nTL;DR - In the next 1-2 weeks expect GME to go Brrrr \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 OTM Calls are finally going to pay.. xd",

        "selftext": "\\[I posted this as a comment in response to someone who said the whole GME saga \"made them sick\".  I thought it was worth posting here.  Not posting in the GME related subs because they probably won't like the fact that I'm not holding.  I believe this is related to the broader topic of stocks and stock trading.  Not sure if this will be deleted.  Disclosure: I hold 0 GME currently.\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm gonna explain this because I think it's worth explaining, and you're free to opinions on GME and on anything, but I am detecting some dickishness on your part and I think it deserves to be called out.\n\nGME was cool because it showed that retail investors can win at this game, too. So big hedge funds like Melvin Capital can hope to multiply their wealth by shorting a dying firm into the ground, yeah? But the people who are just trying to make ends meet working at a company like Gamestop or similar from 9-5 have no hope of ever participating in that kind of play. And in fact they often see their very livelihood threatened by these hedge funds and other financial entities.\n\nTake the case of 2008 for example. Wall Street banks can profit off of unethical practices, normal people can't. And when the music stops, not only do the Wall Street firms get bailed out, they also take down the whole Main Street economy with them.\n\nPeople are tired of Wall Street and the wealthy always having the upper hand. They almost always win, and most of the time they win big. When they don't win, they can't lose, because the government's there to bail them out.\n\nMy degree is in economics. I know the bailout was necessary to save the economy. But it doesn't change the fact that the common people are fed up with this dynamic. They are fed up with it, and they have every reason in the world to be. People's livelihoods were dramatically, dramatically effected by this sort of behavior.\n\nGME represented the first time that retail could win in a big way. And even then, they didn't win. Robinhood cut off the trading. But still, it was a major breakthrough. Average Joes showed that via social media the odds have been evened a bit. Now it's not just hedge funds and mega financial entities that can win at these big plays... retailers have a shot, too.\n\nSome people look at it is \"bringing the Hedgies down\", \"death to the 1%\", etc. I'm not necessarily part of that crowd. But no matter what side of the political spectrum you're on, if you're a retail investor, just an Average Joe, you can be proud of what happened with GME. It was a victory for us. It meant a leveling of the playing field, if only ever so slightly.\n\nI for one am happy that I profited on the long end of things. I really believed in what I was doing, thus why I bought in on the way up the first time, and continued holding. I had never invested in stocks before. But I soon realized that the moment had passed, and that losing money wasn't much of a way to make a statement. So on the way up the second time I cashed out and made small profits.\n\nIf you wanna short it, that's fine. Like I said, you're not making much of a statement by losing money. I for one wouldn't want to short it. I really believed in that movement, no matter how small or insignificant my contribution was. It may not have mattered in the grand scheme of things, but it mattered to *me*.\n\nBut still. You wanna short it? That's fine. But the part about it \"making you sick\". I think that's on you, man.",

Today, I woke up (with only a half chub) and thought to myself \u201cI\u2019m gonna be super productive today and get a ton of work done.\u201d Then, my ADHD medicine kicked in and I went down another GME rabbit hole. Here is the product of that (I will warn you, this is long):\n\nI have done a lot of digging and have found some extraordinary similarities from last year\u2019s annual meeting of stockholders to this one and why it and the months leading up to it should be HUGE for GME. This is not a technical analysis, this is pure DD. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice.\n\nJust a note: you can find all of these documents simply by searching \u201cGamestop Notice of 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders\u201d on Google, I just picked out the important parts to make it easier.\n\n**History**\n\nI am first going to start with GME\u2019s share price as of April 2020:\n\n*Processing img 8vdfrd67c0r61...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can see, on April 3rd, 2020, GME\u2019s price bottomed to under $2. This was due to Covid absolutely crushing the company and shorters seeking to hit the \u201cbankruptcy jackpot.\u201d However, on April 3rd and the next few days, we see the price of GME almost triple all the way up to $6. Why was this? Some of you may remember Michael Burry announced his GME position in April 2020. Well, that\u2019s not what caused this rise as Burry announced his stake on Friday the 10th, which caused a rise on Monday the 13th:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2nex5908c0r61.png?width=1388&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de67e9bdd2d979c91dc9bb43bc53b2a12da68ae9\n\nSo if it wasn\u2019t Michael Burry\u2019s announcement of his position, then what was it? Was it the announcement of the annual shareholder\u2019s meeting? Nope, that was announced in late April as well:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ng9w1hn8c0r61.png?width=1308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80752e0a42df99f79379699efda585b273c938b3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, if it wasn\u2019t either of those things, then what was it? The drastic rise in GME starting April 3rd, 2020 (which seems pathetic compared to today\u2019s price action) was due to a group of activist investors, Hestia Capital, who owned 7.5% of GME at the time announcing that they would be nominating new members of the board at the shareholders meeting. When was this letter released? April 3rd, 2020:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y9fc9ul9c0r61.png?width=1380&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2203bb2a004f5510f8d37d0e0415f26a165233b2\n\nWhy is this significant? Well, for some reason it was pretty well known that GME\u2019s short interest was over 100% at this time (still blows my mind that more people didn\u2019t pounce on this at the time, myself included). Again, this was because Covid was destroying GME and shorts were looking to get the \u201cbankruptcy jackpot.\u201d I believe that this is when shorts were deploying massive amounts of naked shorts. Their reasoning was that if they pushed GME into bankruptcy, they wouldn\u2019t have to repay the naked shorts because the company wouldn\u2019t exist anymore (this is just a theory but it seems reasonable considering what\u2019s happened today). Shorts took a calculated risk that they thought would pay off. Their reasoning was that at the best they hit the bankruptcy jackpot and at the worst they stock goes up a little and they take a slight loss due to the naked shorts (boy were they wrong on that one). Well, their plan almost worked. They got it down to under $3. Then, this statement came out. Why is that statement significant? Well, this letter explicitly stated that GME has high short interest and that in order to vote, shareholders need to recall their shares from anyone who has them on loan before the date of April 20, 2020:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pc0t84fac0r61.png?width=1376&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44b6abff32b7961952a48798d464c491f3c7a445\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLook back at the GME chart that I posted at the top of this. BOOM. This company announces that and people start recalling their shares, forcing some shorts to cover. GME\u2019s massive short interest at this time was already well known:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p0046h2bc0r61.png?width=1326&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffee6642fffdc657bb343467eff365a777f9bb84\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom that point on, GME's price never even got close to that $3 range again:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b5gn9tubc0r61.png?width=1304&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a73405eb69dce6967d5a7a95684f6fcd1e1fb484\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI couldn\u2019t include the rest of the chart because it makes these moves seem insignificant because of GME\u2019s massive price today. This is where the shorts should\u2019ve thrown in the towel and taken the loss, but they didn\u2019t. They kept shorting GME and, as we all know, the short interest eventually hit 140% and the January events happened. And know we\u2019re here, exactly 1 year later to the tee. The rest of this post will be going over the similarities of this period last year to today and my thoughts on what might happen.\n\n**Similarities**\n\nSo, as stated above, GME\u2019s price rose so rapidly on April 3rd because of that proxy statement urging shareholders to recall their shares. This, which was simply an urging, not a full recall, lead to an almost 3x increase in price in just a few days. Imagine if GME does a forced recall of the shares this time around: BOOM.\n\nThe first similarity is the presence of activist investors trying to make a fundamental change to GME as a company. The 2020 activist investor that I mentioned above, Hestia Capital, was what Ryan Cohen currently is. From the proxy statement, we can see that Hestia was actively trying to replace people on the GME board of directors for their inaction and ineffectiveness:\n\n*Processing img adj3y4edc0r61...*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yzjcp6edc0r61.png?width=1324&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3081f2c2f5034871461197e61f6b6e0e1855e1c0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/desngdedc0r61.png?width=1348&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d66cfdecd99b8f97de088f16ab4dcab54aad716b\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, note that the whole point of this proxy letter was Hestia announcing that they are nominating people to the board for the 2020 meeting and that shareholders need to vote. Does this feel any similar to Cohen getting on the board, ousting the C.F.O., and bringing on Chewey and Amazon execs?\n\nThroughout the letter, Hestia documents the reasons for their desire to change the board and documents a history of the events leading up to it. This is far too much information to screenshot, but I encourage you to read it for yourself: [https://news.gamestop.com/node/17596/html](https://news.gamestop.com/node/17596/html) (Search \u201creasons for the solicitation\u201d and \u201cbackground of the solicitation\u201d within the document to find these points).\n\nTo recap, we have the presence of an activist investor trying to shake up the board of GME, GME having a massive short interest, naked/abusive shorting activity, the annual shareholders meeting being in June (last year it was June 12th, this year it is June 11th), and an activist investor trying to change the fundamental direction of the company. All of this went down in April and was related to the shareholders meeting in June.\n\nSounds pretty similar to today right? But what\u2019s the difference? Ryan Cohen is a much stronger activist investor, seems to have more power in the company, has a clearer vision than Hestia, and is making changes more aggressively. Another difference is obviously GME\u2019s price, media coverage, and volume. The short squeeze has made GME a hot media topic, the price is multiples higher than it was a year ago (almost 200x), and the volume (though lower recently) is still MUCH higher than it was one year ago (see any GME chart and compare the volume). But there\u2019s one more difference that is crucial. There is an odd phenomenon in GME today. A strange primate whose scientific name is hominoidea, whose hands are strong as diamonds, and whose wives have endless boyfriends. Yes, I am talking about apes. The uncanny ability of apes to buy and hold throughout any storm has created a sort of wall of support on GME that makes it very hard for shorts to kill the price. Combine that with another strange creature, whose scientific name is Cetacea, who has deep pockets and a symbiotic relationship with hominoidea. This is our whale. This symbiotic relationship means that the shorts are toast (I\u2019m not even joking here, apes have created a wall of support, we have power). Combine all of this with the abusive shorting, failure to deliver cycle, statutory leverage ratio relief not being extended, and new DTCC/SEC regulations on abusive shorting and you have a recipe for tendies.\n\n**The future**\n\nSo, I broke down the past, showed you the similarities, and talked about the present. Now what? Well, here are my thoughts on how the potential GME shareholder\u2019s meeting and the months leading up to it could affect the stock:\n\nFirst, I want to echo what everyone else says about dates and predictions - they are not set in stone, do not base your strategy off of them, and do not treat them as fact as it could lead to more doubt among newer apes. This is not a prediction, this is simply a date/time to keep in mind. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. I am Hank. Uncle Hank.\n\nI would like to turn your attention to the week of April 12th and the week of April 19th. This is a 2 week period. As many of you apes know, our golden ticket would be a share recall. A share recall would force shorts to return the borrowed shares of GME to the rightful owners. Obviously, this would literally force the shorts to cover and would lead to massive tendies. As I've said in my previous posts, GME needs volume in order to rise and catalysts are what create volume. As we have seen, GME is particularly sensitive to catalysts, especially those relating to its leadership and Ryan Cohen. This was most evident when GME shot back up from the dead in late February after they announced the ousting of their C.F.O.\n\nThe SEC does not allow a company to recall its shares earlier than 60 days of the shareholder's annual general meeting. Many people hoped a share recall would be announced during earnings (Mar 23), but this would have been a violation of SEC rules, so that was off the table from the start. For context, here are the dates of the past four meetings: June 10, June 26, Jun 10, June 2. This year\u2019s meeting is June 12th or 11th (not sure which but it\u2019s one of those).\n\nLet's use June 11 as our assumption. 60 days prior to June 10th would put us at April 12. Moreover, the tenure of the current C.E.O. also lines up with that date. The current C.E.O. is on a vesting schedule (incentive to stay with a company until a certain date to receive some form of compensation). Per his vesting schedule, he will get 84k shares of GME on April 15th. GME could possibly be waiting until that date to announce Cohen as the C.E.O. (or at the very least to announce that the current C.E.O. is parting ways with the company). Remember when this happened to the C.F.O in February (the price returned from the dead), just imagine how much bigger the rise would be if this announcement was for the C.E.O.\n\nNow, turn your attention back to everything I said above about last year. Maybe GME will announce that they are planning on holding some kind of vote for board positions, or maybe someone with a significant stake in GME (oh Idk maybe Cohen whose stake is almost double what Hestia\u2019s was) could submit a proxy statement similar to Hestia\u2019s which encourages shareholders to recall their shares so they can vote. Or, maybe GME will announce a forced recall for the purposes of voting (GME already acknowledged in their SEC filing that they are aware that their stock still has very high short interest). Maybe this explains why the conference call was so bland: the C.E.O. knows that he\u2019s on the outs and was instructed by the board to give a bare-bones call so they can announce the juicy stuff later when he\u2019s out. OR, maybe there will be more announcements about more board members coming on similar to the recent announcement of the Chewey and Amazon execs. Either way, if any of these announcements require a vote and shares are forcibly recalled or if it is recommended that shareholders recall their shares, then maybe we will see something similar to last year.\n\nThat date (April 15th) is also significant because the monthly options for April are expiring on April 16. Because of that, expect, at the very least, higher volume on that Friday and the Thursday preceding it. This might also explain why the earnings call felt so bare-bones. AT THE VERY LEAST, we will get some kind of good announcement during the shareholders meeting in June, but I would expect something sooner. At this point, I don't see a world where Cohen is not named a C-suite executive of GME. He owns 13% (obviously has a huge personal interest in its success), has recruited Chewey executives (and maybe the person from Amazon as well), and appears to be shaking up the board and other C-suite positions. I would be shocked if he just kinda sat outside the action as the puppet master. He has too much vested in this to not obtain direct power over the situation. It also appears that the company is going in the direction that he wants to take it (e-commerce shift), so it wouldn't make sense for him not to be a C-suite executive at some point. It's also significant that GME has made leadership announcements in each of the past few months (C.F.O. in February, Amazon + Chewey Execs in March), and that it would make sense for another announcement to come in April especially considering last year's activity in April regarding leadership and where Cohen is currently trying to take the company.\n\nAs many of you know DFV's calls expire on that day. At this point, it should be obvious that he is exercising those because if he was gonna just take the profits and rollover the contract, he would've done so much earlier because theta has been eating those. This is again just conjecture, but maybe DFV is waiting until that date to exercise his calls in order to inflict more pain on market makers for failing to deliver shares. This is again just conjecture did research similar to this and came to the conclusion that April 16th would be a crucial day, so he is waiting til then to exercise to put more pressure on the failure to delivers. If you've kept up with his updates, he has plenty of cash on hand so he could easily exercise these. What he could also do is buy more calls (at a later date), which would put obvious upward pressure on the stock. One thing is for certain, he's not going to let those options expire worthless, especially considering the fact that he has millions in cash in his account.\n\nFinally, I also wanted to discuss why I believe that the leadership of GME (at least the new ones) and Cohen are on our side, which is why a share recall would benefit them. First, as we all know, Cohen loves to tweet cryptic stuff (it's actually pretty obvious that it's about GME). A few weeks ago he tweeted that video of the puppet that people deciphered to be about a commercial that said \"I love your shorts.\" Recently he tweeted a vid of TED hitting a bong that people deciphered to mean either bears got smoked or bears took a big hit (this is when it shot up significantly in a day). So, as we all know Cohen is insanely interested in GME and its stock price - and why wouldn't he be, he has 13% ownership (there are also reports of him calling up disgruntled customers asking how he can make their service better). Now, this is why a share recall would benefit GME. There are two different sets of assumptions that we have to work with here: assumption 1 is that the leadership of GME (Cohen included) does not subscribe to the theory that GME is abusively shorted. If we go with this assumption and say that GME is only shorted 25% (boomer data), a share recall benefits them because it will alleviate some of the selling pressure that shorting creates, which will allow the stock to go up. Assumption 2 (the more likely assumption) is that the leadership subscribes to the theory that GME is being abusively shorted. The reason why I believe this is more likely is because of their SEC filing where they addressed that GME has high short interest and that continuing this could cause a short squeeze. This was like when Porsche announced that they had a huge stake in VW to \"warn\" the shorts to cover. If this theory is true, GME is aware that their company is being abusively shorted and is not reflective of the real price of the stock. Therefore, it would be significantly in their interest to recall shares, which would force naked shorts to cover and would DRASTICALLY decrease the downward pressure. Whichever theory they subscribe to, it benefits them immensely to do a recall, and I believe that assumption 2 is far more likely.\n\nYeah I know that was long, rabbit holes will do that to ya.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nOne year ago to the tee, GME\u2019s stock rose on the announcement that an activist investor was having a vote and they recommended shareholders to recall their shares. The short interest was over 100%. The activist investor sought to shakeup management and change the direction of GME. Fast forward to today (exactly 1 year later), and we have an activist investor changing up the company. If GME does a share recall ahead of this meeting or if Cohen releases a proxy statement encouraging shareholders to recall their shares, we could very well see a meteoric rise similar to last year at this time. GME has not provided much information on that meeting, so, similar to last year, updates could come in the month of April. We know that any announcement about leadership changes makes the stock rise.\n\nNot a financial advisor, not financial advice. Am primate.",

        "selftext": "CLOV has a very interesting setup right now but way too many people seem to only care about the short float debate that has been unfolding over the last few days. To sum that up: FactSet (top financial data provider) had the CLOV float listed as 23.5M and short interest at 39M - putting the percentage of the float shorted at 146.6%. This circulated online and has been argued on twitter and reddit starting Friday. Factset has since updated the float to 109.8M making the 39M short interest account for 36% of the float. They previously had deducted the CEO\u2019s class B shares from the total class A shares, and although his shares are \u201cnon-tradeable\u201d and shouldn't be included in the public float, they were only using the class A shares to determine the float as all class B shares are already non-tradeable unless converted - so shouldn\u2019t have been part of the equation to begin with. Now I could get more into the \u2018Hindenberg said this\u201d and \u201cS3 said this\u201d bullshit that people have been arguing about...\n\nBut heres why NONE OF THAT EVEN FUCKING MATTERS\n\nShorts and those who have been bashing CLOV and arguing against the original short float number are taking a victory lap, like Factset updating the short float to 36% destroys the entire bullish case for CLOV and now it will tank. BULLSHIT, here\u2019s why:\n\nThe 39M short interest number being used in the short float calculation is from 3/31. Over two weeks ago. When the two highest volume and highest short volume days in CLOV history have occurred within the last two weeks. With \\~30M shares shorted on 4/8 and \\~90M shares shorted on Friday (according to Fintel). We don\u2019t know at this time how much of the short volume has since covered and would be included in the current short interest; but given all this, you could logically conclude the short float on CLOV right now could be pretty damn high. For context, 36% short float - based on outdated short interest from 3/31 - is in the ballpark of double what we're currently seeing in GME or AMC, and would still make CLOV one of the highest short float stocks in the entire market right now.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rvr4bslwszt61.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=801f7c4f339e3573272d280586c7a9bd54d8343d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l4ssab8yszt61.png?width=2010&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10de1da2465f375d84f5d28bdf9689936cf5af48\n\nThe short float is only a small piece of the puzzle, and it\u2019s without a doubt high enough to trigger a short squeeze if prices continue to rise, end of story. Now let\u2019s get into the shit that really matters.\n\nFirst off, from a technical perspective, there are some good signs. (if you hate technical analysis or think you're so good at it that you'll find a way to disagree with whatever I say then skip to the next section)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/06weuky6tzt61.png?width=1125&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64b8a0b9d28d85d079627746c4e1832aec8f153e\n\n* MACD bullish\n* RSI only starting to warm up\n* Decent support built between $7-$7.30\n* But what\u2019s really screaming on this chart are these two recent MASSIVE buying volume days coming after about a month of consolidation with a double bottom pattern making higher lows.\n\n**Now let\u2019s get into call volume**\n\n[Some of the order that came through Friday](https://preview.redd.it/ksveumt0tzt61.png?width=1108&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2577d77bf9ab0d6f3180c955e9af5b861f859f3b)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a7e1pes3tzt61.png?width=730&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83c9ea5a0d92808cfd65626f792fa1078443b1ed\n\nFridays call flow and the sheer volume and open interest on some of these call options speak for themselves. This is where I should break down the mechanics of a gamma squeeze, but really all you need to know is that heavy call volume is important for two reasons: 1) it can be a good indicator of where money is flowing in the market and 2) the people who write the call options need to buy shares to hedge against their position. The more the price rises the more shares they need to buy, helping to push price higher just like we see in a short squeeze.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext, CLOV is down over 50% from Dec/Jan highs. Some of the main reasons for the drop would be:\n\n* Money flowing out of growth stocks and SPACS\n* Hindenberg short report\n* Short seller price manipulation\n\nThe Hindenburg short attack really did a number on CLOV. The stock was trading at about $14 prior to the release of their short report and dropped over 50% in the weeks following its release.\n\nHindenburg attacked CLOV from many different angles. One of their main arguments being that Clover Health uses misleading and unethical marketing practices to boost sales, as evidence stating that in 2016: \u201cClover was fined for misleading marketing practices by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS)\u201d\n\nWell, just this month (April 8th), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services granted Clover heath approval in 10 new states. CLOV has yet to release a PR on this but it has been updated on the CMS website (see picture below). The stock price jumped with huge volume on this news but short sellers were able to manipulate it back down until the spike we just saw on Friday.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sc2w81eatzt61.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7eb791918794ff6a425e42fffa397e409788b782\n\nIt seems that Hindenbergs argument doesn\u2019t hold up as the same federal agency (CMS) they were using to support claims against Clover Health is currently supporting Clovers expansion into 10 new states. Which is huge news for CLOV by the way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Wrapping this up**\n\nNow say what you will about Chamath, but he had retail investors back during the GME squeeze. He promoted it, posted his personal positions, and while Wall Street, CNBC, and others attacked Gamestop, Chamath defended retail traders and the movement as a whole. It may be a total coincidence that his SPAC\u2019s were the target of short attacks shortly after, but his support of the GME squeeze may have made him a bigger target.\n\nAdditionally, we saw Hindenberg quickly come out Friday pushing back against the CLOV short squeeze premise. This could be out of the goodness of Nathan's heart, just wanting to spread the truth\u2026 OR it could be an indication that Hindenberg and/or the short sellers they work with behind the scenes are worried and stand to loose significant money if CLOV squeeze continues. This may be our best chance to fight back against the short selling market manipulation targeted against retail - an opportunity to make Hindenburg and the short selling hedge funds they work with the next Melvin Capital. Do we let that opportunity pass by?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo one knows what will happen in the market, I sure as hell don\u2019t, but given all that's been laid out here, I like the stock.\n\n$CLOV to $100",

        "selftext": "First off, this is not financial advice! We are all gambling for goodness sake (sir, this is a casino). It's called wallstreetBETS for a reason. This is simply my personal opinion and if you read it, COOL! If not, COOL!\n\nP.S. I dove head first into the stock market for one reason and one reason only, TO MAKE MONEY! And honestly, I haven't done that at all so I know I belong here! But without further ado:\n\nThere are two types of people, 1) people who can effectively analyze the technicals of a stock like GME and 2) liars. There is no way any of you mother effers can account for the volatility of this stock, the amount of holders, the true short interest, and momentum. So take whatever you learned from your little youtube video or on investopedia about your cute Elliott wave theory, fibonacci retracement, and MY FAVORITE \"do you see that cup and handle formation,\" no I don't you idiot, it's like looking at the dam clouds, you can create anything with an imagination! The reason I can say this so confidently is because I was one of the retards that thought I could analyze the stock with my tools only to find out I was wrong every time! I mean I hit some targets, but where there was supposed to be support it fell, where there was supposed to be resistance it broke through, there is no telling where the thing is going (hopefully up). Rather than focusing on the technicals instead I have been paying attention to trends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[I even color coded this bihh for you. Shout out to kidsdoodle .net for the help!](https://preview.redd.it/mrajg8l1igr61.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5e0350d9dddf0ce4fc172955e2d46dc76bde047)\n\n**12/23/20 - 1/12/21:**\n\nPrice consolidated around $16 - $22 only to advance up to \\***$43.40!**\n\n**1/15/21 - 1/22/21:**\n\nPrice consolidated around $35 - $45 only to advance up to $481.19!\n\n**2/4/21 - 2/24/21:**\n\nPrice consolidated around **\\*$40 - $60** only to advance up to \\*\\***$182.49!**\n\n**3/1/21 - 3/4/21:**\n\nPrice consolidated around $110 - $130 only to advance up to $346.74!\n\n**Present:**\n\nPrice is consolidating around \\*\\***$170 - $200** only to advance up to x!\n\nHopefully you retards can comprehend what I am trying to illustrate here. I mean it's pretty simple, price bounces around a certain price then breaks out (up in this case), then corrects (goes down), then repeats. Notice how some of the highs tend to become support where the price consolidates (stays in a specific range). All I know is that I am pretty happy with the price hanging around the $180 - $200 range or even lower because that seems to becoming a nice support level. Who knows what could happen, let's just hope history repeats itself. I just like the stock and I get excited when bollinger bands squeeze (the white lines)! \n\n**TL;DR:**\n\nIt's not even long, read it!",

        "selftext": "Short story-time for amusement reasons only:\n\nsome days ago, I went to my bank (Austria). I am the owner of quite a number of GME shares and my broker app is actually just the bank-intern bond trading app, where I need to pay transactional feed everytime I buy (what is sell?) GME shares. I informed myself about the reasoning of those transactional fees beforehand and found out that by paying them, I have the right of consultation by my bank about the shares they\u2018re trading/I\u2018m buying. \n\nSo, I went to the main national building of my bank, they were really friendly at the beginning, enthustiatically, I mentioned GME to them and that I wish for professional consultation about the financial details involved with that stock (I am not a financial guy, actually, I don\u2018t exactly know what\u2018s going on, it\u2018s all pretty crazy to me). \n\nSuddenly, their posture and mimick changed pretty suddenly. I was told, they are not allowed to consult about GME. To my question, why this was the case, they told me, because GME is \u201etoo irrelevant for the big stock market\u201c. They are \u201eaware of the past short squeeze, but one should no longer focus on GME\u201c. They acted as if GME was some \u201echildish financial playground\u201c that should be forgotten about. When I confronted them with the huge recent naked short attacks and if they could explain to me possible effects of them if they were not covered, they just repeated themselves how \u201eGME is not relevant, please focus on stocks like Apple or Amazon to be safe\u201c. \n\nI left the bank, buying more GME shares.",

        "selftext": " \n\nFirst thing's fist: I don't know what the hell I'm doing. I'm just an ape throwing my own feces at the wall and calling it DD. I'm not saying that to be cheeky, I'm saying that because I'm probably wrong about a lot in this post and would appreciate being corrected. *I ain't no goddamn financial advisor. Ain't no goddamn financial advice. I just think the goddamn stock is nice.*\n\nSecond of all, I am not trying to predict a date. However, as many other fine simians before me have already elucidated, it's very likely that GME will rise and falls several times during leading up to the MOAS like so many ominous rumbling farts preceding an epic shart. Just as it is with a sloppy wet one, there are usually preceding clues that make you mentally take stock of your supply of clean underwear (I don't know why there's already so many shit analogies in this post, I really don't). One of the most commonly used metrics used to predict a bearish or bullish turn is the MACD.\n\n[A different kind of soft serve](https://preview.redd.it/vgcguphy5rr61.png?width=680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64c9755f28ec6b585db463c3f61ebbfd14c4dfa0)\n\nIt stands for Moving Average Convergence Divergence (there's a tongue twister for ya). The MACD is calculated using the difference between two exponential moving averages of a stock, usually over 26 days and 12 days. The MACD can be be either positive (more bullish) or negative (more bearish) but is most often tracked against the 9 day exponential moving average (EMA9) of the MACD itself in order to predict bullish or bearish sentiment. If it moves above its EMA9, it signals upward momentum and a recent or pending reversal. This is also known as the sought after **golden cross**. Day traders, of which GME has ***none*** \\*glares for dramatic effect\\*, use the MACD on the 15min, 30min, and 1hr charts to try and predict swings. To better prepare for impending sharp bounces or falls in our favorite stonk, I looked at macro trends in the 4hr and 1 day MACD preceding known squeezes. There are few trends I've noticed.\n\n* The MACD will often already be above the EMA9 leading up to a bounce. This makes sense because it's measuring growing momentum. However, this isn't always the case.\n* The MACD in volatile stocks will often dip below the EMA9 after the stock has already dropped following a bounce.\n* The 4hr charts usually show a golden cross before a sudden uptick\n* The 1 day chart's golden cross usually lags a little behind but is a better indicator of steady momentum and sentiment vs. volatile swings\n\nLet's take a look at these crosses in action using some established examples. First, we got PLTR. Palantir only recently went public in late 2020 and started out strong. On the 1 day chart, you can see the MACD sliding under the EMA9 for the first time on 12/11/20 followed by an extended period of trading mostly sideways.\n\n[PLTR 1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/ty0h2io06rr61.png?width=1635&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c19eec76613ed72d807e1ddedc49e76327e9fda5)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver a month later, it crossed positive again on 01/21/21 just as the gamma squeeze started. However, you can see the trend lines slowly coalescing just before that point, hinting at an impending upswing in momentum.\n\n[PLTR 1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/hq2uird36rr61.png?width=1631&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=153aee863e91337687c85ff7038b04c106ecf6fd)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, the golden cross appears **much earlier** on the 4hr chart.\n\n[PLTR 4HR Chart](https://preview.redd.it/z4dy29556rr61.png?width=1629&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a877f289bab3f432e1a972cfbe8cdcb8965065f2)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe negative MACD crossing during its double peak only happened **after** it fell on **both** drops.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[PLTR 1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/wmgjhk576rr61.png?width=1631&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75514080b49d216d5594e8b6155b22794077882e)\n\n[PLTR 1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/f0d7a1b86rr61.png?width=1635&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc901b0ed6e09ec8bbee4866a905ebad79fef4b4)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother well known recent event is SNDL's squeeze. On the 1 day chart, you can see the golden cross occur just as the stock starts its meteoric climb. Unfortunately, its crash came abruptly and the negative crossing only happened after its descent. The gap between the MACD and EMA9 oscillated but most important to note is how narrow their gap was in the days preceding the upswing. And again, the golden cross comes about a day earlier on the 4hr chart compared to the 1 day and the negative crossing occurs **after** the drop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[SNDL 1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/r89d6yga6rr61.png?width=1628&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fda5f96e4e513c86ce322de2655f9c30df01bcdd)\n\n[SNDL 4HR Chart](https://preview.redd.it/4n7tl0tb6rr61.png?width=1626&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c72d835fe24673cbe7ec13f0b0deda012db2db7)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, let's look at the golden boy himself, TSLA. This is a great one to use because the squeeze lasted for so long and consisted of several mini squeezes leading up to its eventual peak. The MACD and EMA9 oscillated back and forth very tightly up until 12/13/19 when it crossed over days before a massive upswing. The cross appeared earlier on the 4hr chart on 12/09/19. The stock then crashed but interestingly not before the negative cross reared its head to signal downward momentum.\n\n[TSLA 1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/nuimd6bd6rr61.png?width=1897&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1aa318ba8b04b880978d289092cd0274d870f54)\n\n[TSLA 4HR Chart \\(this was tough to find for some reason\\)](https://preview.redd.it/ds2bhuue6rr61.png?width=893&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e552b85ed0b6c295a3f1d70cc170095c14858d8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can see this pattern repeat again and again\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9bdc6kzg6rr61.png?width=1902&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e3d6ea82c0306ff61d80b6d7685efb848239e8f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe 4HR chart caught the next upswing in August earlier by 2 days. The most recent spike with a golden cross was caught at the start on both 1 day and 4hr charts on 11/17/20\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0wt6nvmi6rr61.png?width=2836&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21b26d4e15073ff96d2eab1574d944626751c929\n\nSo...wtf does this have to GME? Well rev up dem tits, boys, we're goin tendie huntin!\n\nThe squeeze that could have been had its golden cross MUCH sooner than the peak but did happen to occur on the 1 day chart right in the middle of a bump on 01/13/21. The crossover occurred a day earlier on the 4hr chart.\n\n[GME 1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/di6fftuj6rr61.png?width=1907&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4852d32f9c07d9437be87102c15905a136d50d31)\n\n[GME 4HR Chart](https://preview.redd.it/x4xlqyel6rr61.png?width=1915&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa29a14c5987f3ef3ba6610964991c6b18f72e6b)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Second Coming coincided with another cross but well after it began on the 1 day chart on 02/25/21. What about the 4hr? It shows up **four trading days earlier** on 02/19/21\n\n[GME 1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/s1707wen6rr61.png?width=1911&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=073b05a050cd764d5c6e45d071db01c3b6f7185b)\n\n[GME 4HR Chart](https://preview.redd.it/48jttkdo6rr61.png?width=1909&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b143b7e52d58847cfcb32a18364d5a1936662c3)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that brings us to today. On the 1 day chart, the MACD is still underwater with a spread of -5.09. You can see the channel narrowing. For comparison, the spread on the 1 day chart was -3.58 on 02/24/19 the day before it crossed.\n\n*Processing img 2quuzm7q6rr61...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat about the 4hr chart, you ask? We already crossed over. **FIVE TRADING DAYS AGO**\n\n[GME 4HR Chart](https://preview.redd.it/z73b17ur6rr61.png?width=1909&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e0b93dcc1e81049c78b9c112201645fdeeb0d07)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe MACD and EMA9 are currently oscillating. We slipped back under the EMA9 on the 4hr chart yesterday but only just barely. The spread is -0.09 so it may as well be zero. Look at the narrowing of the two trend lines. See how they come together and have been twisting back and forth since 03/30? That's a fuse being spun together. Are you ass cheeks clenched yet? Well clench harder. Let's look at MACD and EMA9 spread for the 1 day chart starting from 01/13/21.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/baarfwat6rr61.png?width=154&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24f97c7c603005bf79c3191a66a4b18e850564f9\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can see, the spread has remained negative for 11 days in a row. The previous spread remained negative for 13 days in a row before the stock jumped from $44 to close at $91 the following day. The stock had also just hit a 28 day low volume of 7.57 million the day before it jumped. The previous low occurred on 01/12 with a volume of 7.06 million **the day before the MACD-EMA9 spread turned positive** **on the day chart**. Yesterday's volume was **6.08 million,** ***a 29 day low.***\n\nTL;DR\n\nFuse lit. Wait for boom boom. Buy. Hodl. Clench dem cheeks. \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "TL;DR  \ud83c\udf40go brrrrr \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \n\nHowdy degenerates!\n\nI bet you saw the price action in $CLOV yesterday (+20%)? Turns out the shorts got greedy again -- close to 120% greedy.\n\nWhat??? Haven't they learnt their lesson with $GME at once? Apparently not. The $GME squeeze has cost a bunch of hedge funds (Melvin, Maplelane, D1) billions in losses on top of their damaged reputation and 'prestige'.\n\nThese hedge funds hold a lot of grudge towards a few people that chipped in during the $GME squeeze of January 2021 -- namely Chamath. See excerpt from Greenlight Capital (David Einhorn's hedge fund) letter:\n\n[Einhorn's April 15 letter to investors](https://preview.redd.it/f54gnkshapt61.png?width=1254&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f408458520ba063250597ad9c2e270e73eddfb75)\n\nTheir weapon of choice -- shorting $CLOV, which was SPACed by Chamath.\n\nIsn\u2019t $CLOV a pos stock? No, and even if it is, this is irrelevant. As you already figured it out, most short squeezes are mostly math. I think this will unfold whether or not we take part in it.\n\n**$CLOV Short Interest:**\n\n$CLOV has 118% short interest. Shorts will try an tell you that this is much lower. In fact that's exactly what Hindenburg tried to do today. Hindenburg even e-mailed FactSet to try an counter S3 Partners data (although their calculation also seems to be incorrect). The table below is based on Clover's 10K + latest 13G filed by Vanguard, so should be very close to reality:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/osbjmrweapt61.png?width=1324&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77d1b36c6532e3d7e569cec2021a3fc7de03b37e\n\n[This includes CEO's shares -- it shouldn't. ](https://preview.redd.it/ypfw5kulapt61.png?width=862&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49333325388e5108d6af6c4b6d5b9b15c797c210)\n\nShorts are intentionally including CEO's shares into the float to make it appear larger. This is boneheaded at best and intentionally deceitful at worst:\n\n* The CEO (Vivek Garipalli) is the founder of $CLOV; the likelihood of him selling his shares is close to nil\n* All his shares are Class B (10-to-1 voting ratio vs. Class A; only Class A shares are traded on the open market -- so they shouldn't be in the calculation in the first place), which means that if he sells or transfers his shares this will generally result in those shares converting to Class A (i.e. losing the supervoting feature)\n* Even if he would decide to sell, the shares are still locked-up until July\n* Management incentive plan is anchored at $30 per share. What this means is that the share price has to exceed $30 for 90 consecutive days in order for management plan RSUs to vest and be possible to sell\n\n***What does this mean?***\n\nWhat this means is that a very small amount of $CLOV shares are free to trade because \\~78% of the shares are still owned by insiders, locked-up and not trading. It only takes a little bit of gamma juice to make $CLOV move A LOT.\n\n**Timing:**\n\nTiming this is tricky. $CLOV is due to announce results on May 20th, so save for any other good news, this would be our catalyst.\n\nTo capture the biggest upside, the highest strike call options are the best for this. Currently the only May expiry options are 5/21 $30C (still cheap at $0.2). There is A LOT of calls OI for that date.\n\nInducing some gamma juice so that MMs have to hedge with more shares, making the shorts cover, increasing the Delta of our call options further, would help getting there and beyond.\n\nRemember $CLOV ATH was $17.45 -- even if ALL shorts opened positions at that level, they would be 70% underwater if it hits $30. If you add leverage (all hedge funds are levered), say 2x -- they would be looking at a forced cover / liquidation \u00e0 la Archegos.\n\nObligatory: I am a financial degenerate and this is for entertainment purposes only.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Last of all came the cat, who looked round, as usual, for the warmest place, and finally **squeezed** herself in between Boxer and **Clover**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*George Orwell*",

During the first couple of days, I was seeing you all on TV and it really made my days. I was so proud of this sub. Before leaving, I had set my limit orders and then didn't have any computer access until January 29th.\n\nIn the meantime, most of my limit orders hit.

        "selftext": "I am not a financial advisor, and this is not financial advice.\n\nI have a significant position in GME.  I bought in around $100, have been constantly buying more over time, and have held from $350 to today's price (currently $156).  I will continue to buy/hold.  I'm not here to give you a floor, but I can sure as hell guarantee you that I'm not selling my shares anywhere near 1k.  \n\nI won't lie to y'all, I originally bought in solely for the squeeze potential, but that's not why I'm here anymore.  We don't know if the squeeze will squooze, but what we do know is that we will profit handsomely if we're patient.  Let's go over a few things:\n\n**(1) No one knows the short interest (SI).  There are zero reliable sources for SI data.  Everything that you see is entirely speculation.  Therefore, no one knows if shorts have covered or fucking quintupled down or worse.**\n\n**(2) If we are truly apart of one of the most heinous financial conspiracies that the world has even seen, I guarantee you the MOASS will NOT occur until the proper safeguards are in place, i.e. NSCC/DTCC/OCC regulations.  If the market can be manipulated to fuck retail, it can be manipulated to delay a MOASS until certain measures are in place.  These regulations may not be fully approved for 2-3 months.**\n\n**(3) Gamestop, led by Ryan Cohen, is beginning a fundamental transformation.   They paid off their debt.  They're replacing nearly all of their top level execs.  They're forming an e-commerce company with people who were part of building some of the most successful e-commerce companies in existence. If/when this transformation is successful, it could result in GME's price reaching more than $1000 in the next 1-3 years or so.  This is completely independent of any squeeze.**\n\n*I believe that illegal market manipulation is taking place, there's a ridiculous amount of short interest, the MOASS will eventually occur, and on top of that the Gamestop transformation will be wildly successful.  I don't know when the MOASS could happen.  I can't possibly estimate a floor since I don't know the real short interest.  What I do know is that this is the best investment opportunity that I've ever seen and here's the best way to think about this play:*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. If you believe in the transformation thesis, this should be the easiest investment play of your life.  Some of us bought in a $4, $40, or even $400.  Let's assume most people's average share price is $200.  So if the price were to get to $1000, then you've made 5x your initial investment.  That's fucking insane.  You can't go anywhere in the world and find a (legal and cheap buy in) investment opportunity that has a pretty damn good chance of giving you a 5x return and all you have to do is wait a few years.\n2. If the MOASS occurs, and the majority of people believe in (1), then one would assume that those people will hold to far beyond low $XXXX.  Why wouldn't you?  You believe that the price is going to get near there relatively soon anyway.  Again, I'm not here to set a floor, but if GME squeezes, I will say that I won't sell below $XXXXX, and I'd hope that even the most paper handed of apes wouldn't either.\n\nSo to reiterate: even if there is no squeeze, even if all the shorts have covered, even if some demonic intervention takes place and fucks over retail letting the shorters escape, if you hold, there's a very good chance that you're going to get make a ridiculous return.  I'd love to be apart of this transformation, and I'm more than happy to wait for my tendies.\n\n \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  **\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc**  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "Hi Everyone,\n\nIn case you missed my first posts on my efforts of counting gme yolos they can be found here: [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mdex64/dd_i_counted_all_the_wallstreetbets_gme_yolos/) [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/me13xm/dd_part_2_i_counted_all_the_wallstreetbets_gme/)\n\nTo summarize I am manually recording every instance of people posting their positions.  I have dedupped the data and interestingly the only instances of repeat users has been users increasing their positions. This could be because the type of the user to post their position is fully committed or if they do decrease their position they won't post. Either way pretty interesting. I am making some pretty stupid assumptions that of all the positions I have recorded no one has paper handed. Previously I had recorded 261 yolos holding 339,958 shares. \n\n**Updated Data:** Since then I have recorded an additional 212 positions for a total of **473** positions representing **576,433** shares. With current after hours share prices of $160.81 these shares represent **$92,696,190.73** or for those that can't read big numbers **92.6 million**. \n\nAs I had mentioned in my previous posts I personally believe the [rule of 1%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_%28Internet_culture%29) on the internet applies to these yolo positions and for every position posted there are likely 10-100 that are silent. Just for fun if we apply the 1:9:90 ratio for content creator, upvoter  and viewer. We can make a some what irresponsible estimates of  silent whales :\n\n1:9= 4,257 Silent WSB Kongs with 5,187,897 shares.\n\n1:90= 42,570 Silent WSB Kongs with 51,878,970 shares.\n\nEither way retail owns a lot and can make an big impact by holding.\n\nTDLR: Just 473 WSB Kongs hold 576,433 shares worth 92.6M",

        "selftext": "(This was my response to a young investor here. Thought I might just post it, I like to lurk but whatever. Some edits have been made.)\n\nFor what it is worth this is my advise:\n\nSAVING IS HARD. Unless you were born to wealth it is hard. Sometimes even saving $5 is hard, and as you climb up in life there are always new things you will see to spend your money on. \n\n#1 if you see money laying on the ground PICK THAT UP. IT'S FREE MONEY. People throw money down because they don't know what money is really worth or what money can do. PICK IT UP AND POCKET THAT. NEVER THROW MONEY DOWN, NOT EVEN A PENNY. Damn, I hate seeing money on the ground. Even that penny was some time or labor earned, dont disregard that time and labor. \n\nTry to use your money earned to make you happy, but put some back. Even if it is only $5 this week, but you wanted to go out and have a good steak. \n\nIf you did not grow up with a family that knows how money works you need to educate yourself. They won't teach you in school. You either need family to teach you or you will have to learn on your own. Go to your library and read finance books, subscribe to some financial magazines, and watch YouTube, or go to broker sites and go through their online education stuff. TDA (not that I'm a fan of them or anything), Fidelity both have some good reading and watching. \n\nMy grandfather was born in the great depression to a pretty poor family, joined the navy, became a cop and spent 1960 (he was 30 when this got intresting to him) the day he died, investing and trying to learn this shit and tried to teach me what he found out, and I have spent the last 20+ years doing it too. I've gotten pretty good at what I can find and I'm 41, still think I'm not all that good at it, but I could still just say F it and retire today if I wanted to. Make no mistake, if you do not have generational support you have a lot to do, make sure you pass on what you learn. I try to educate my friends and family that will listen, but I feel like a blowhard sometimes. \n\nGo to seminars, or online live stuff. Learn the financial products and how to use them. Learn how to read company financials and how to interpret it. \n\nNone of this takes a huge amount of time. Spend 5 or 10 hours a week doing this instead of watching tv, reading fantasy, playing games (or working, fuck the man).  \n\nIn 1 year you will be ahead of 90% of others. \n\nDon't believe what financial media is telling you, by the time you hear it from them it's already over and the big boys are looking for bag holders. You have to learn how to do your own due diligence. Never believe anything you can't verify.  Pretty sure CrMer was shouting to buy lemanbrothers in 2008... that worked out well?\n\nBroad market ETFs are seeming more and more like those bundled loan securities pre 2008. Looks like we might see more losers than winner soon, but I could be wrong.... do your research. \n\nI like managed funds. Vanguard and Fidelity have their reputation for a GOOD reason, and they have their own clearing houses. \n\nPick a solid broker, read above. \n\nGet a ROTH and max it before anything else, then standard IRA, then brokerage. Try hard as hell to get 6 months or 1 year of savings to cover basic expenses. \n\nDon't be afraid to gamble a little every now and then, but don't make a r/WSB yolo 90% of your portfolio. Unless that's your risk tolerance... investing really is ALL ON YOU. (You can [and I have] make good money on a meme stock, but pIck an entry and exit; you do NOT need a 1000% gain, a 10% gain is PROFIT, AND PROFIT: IS PROFIT.)\n\nStart with managed ETFs, mutual funds, then maybe some passive ETFs that track indexes. Then, Once you  have your feet wet, and have some cash in savings (don't forget that inflation will take cash out of your pocket, but a market correction could take more [it's a balancing act]) Try some stock picking.\n\nAfter you have set yourself up  try picking some stocks. Look long term, 10+ years. I like inovationers or solid old companies that just truck along and pay dividends. Healthcare, biotech, chips, multifamily REITs are what I'm in. Go global too. \n\nMaybe after you are set long term, try short term picks. It really is all about risk and risk tolerance. \n\nAfter you have a little bank roll sell some options. Sell cash covered puts for stocks you like or own and want more of for a lesser price. Sell covered calls on stocks you have, and this can lower your cost basis.  \n\nDon't do naked calls, dont short sell. Avoid Infinite risk, but know what your risk is and go for it if you think you might have a win. \nIf you bet $500 on a play that could get you 5k I call that an ok gamble, IF you can take a $500 risk. \n\nIf you are not from a family already rich now, its about getting rich in 10, 20, or 30 years. Save now. Learn how this works, have capital for down turns (buy dips and crashes), and ride the waves. This is a lot easier if you are young and have the time to ride it out while you wage slave. \n\nLook at any chart of any index over 20 or 30 or even 100 years, guess what ..... stocks go up.\n\nDon't try to out think the market. Go with the flow. Follow the waxing and waning. Markets move through rotations just like tides in the sea. Move with it, not against it. \n\nDONT PANIC. \n\nDon't trade with emotion, do your due diligence and analysis, and. stick. to. your. plan.\n\nLearn how to make a budget and include your investments into it.\n\nBuy 1 or 2 realestate properties. Everything you invest after purchase price is considered a loss and can offset your tax burden (even if it adds value).\n\n\nLearn some hedges. I take a 1% stake against my positions with 1yr puts or calls every year. If I'm down in a year I'll take a 1% value call option. If I'm up I'll take a 1% put a year out. Its like insurance. And believe me, it CAN and WILL save your ass. \n\nTime in the market vs timing the market ... time in always wins, but having bad timing can set you back a long time. \n\nAnyway, at the end of the day... just do something. \n\nDo not disregard other avenues of investment either. Realestate, income property, land, art, farms, cattle (it's a big one where I'm from), antiques, clasic cars (but that might be over after all the boomers are gone [I'm gen X and still remember the smell of them (and that is a real thing kids)]. \n\nTry not to fall into investment fads.\n\nWhen I was a kid these collectors thought these stupid bennie baby things and pogs were for life.... if those dumb*sses would have bought $AAPL instead they wouldn't still have tubs of useless, multicolored, cute cotton, whatever animal like things they would have yachts. Those damb card games are another one, yes I do have some Magic gathering cards worth some money, but I didn't buy it as an investment, I was a geek who liked playing the game with my friends.\n\nAnd buy some $GME. Even 2 shares. That shit is crazy, who knows what will happen.\n\n\n*I am not a financial advisor, I'm just a dude on the internet sharing what he has learned. Nothing should be taken as any type of financial advise, but everyone should save some money and invest with using their own risk tolerance and the help of a certified financial adviser (not me).*",

        "selftext": "Hi Fam, its me, Fam. \n\nThere is something going on with GME and it may be  **imminent**\nThis is my interpretation of GME thru wave counting/elliotwave. \n\nRefer to this image first : https://i.imgur.com/CR0OiQJ.jpg\n\nFrom a yearly point of view, we have accomplished wave 1(A) and wave 2(B) colored blue for those colored blind (idk how that works). We are in the mist of forming wave C.  That will be interpreted in the following paragraph. From this standpoint, we have strong support level at 23.6 fib level (priced 142.79). It was actually broken, but that level was a *test* to see how far it will go down. It found support again (twice) on several different locations (weeks later) This is very important because the psychology of the market (investors) show a threshold and now pointing towards a bullish movement - even though we were consolidating. Now, per elliot wave analysis, Wave 3 is the **BIGGEST** wave of the 5 wave formation. It  must past the high of 488.51 in order to be called a elliot wave 3 or C wave. There are several *mini* resistance levels we must past but as I am typing, we pushed past two of them. The next important level of all is Price $200 which is surprisingly at fib level 38.2. Thats a magic number for later. We can *predict where Wave 3 may end* and that number is 504 .34- 531.72. (math not included) \n\nRefer to image: https://i.imgur.com/cw86Lhx.jpg\nThis image basically tells me half time is over and the bell just rung. The pendant is forming or has already formed.  Its a signal and confirms the psychoanalysis of market (retail investors and all) that there is a upward movement. However, there needs to be a stimulus or break out movement out. This image now focuses on our micro analysis of wave 3 (C). Wave 1 of wave C has completed and assumingly so, wave 2 (b) of bigger wave 3 is consolidating (pendant). Quick fib analysis: We find resistance at fib level 23.6 (priced at 169.26). Then again we have fib level 38.2 hovering around price 200 (remember this - important later down the road). If we want some kind of breakout, we need to close above 200, followed by some stimulus (upward movement factor). In addition, this pendant formed a higher lows but also lower highs (consolidation). \n\nOn the daily,\n* if we close above 169-170, thats a great start\n* Then close above 200, price movement is building momentum for wave C - which should have the biggest momentum of all 5 waves\n* Theoretically, it needs to close above 351.90 to confirm wave 3(C), but remember thats only the smaller version of Wave 3. \n\nIf this happens, it can theoretically push bigger wave 5 to around 800 (depends on market volatility and demand) to XXXXs. \n\n TLDR: Wave 3's forming. There is a pressure on GME market and it may be bullish movement from now on. Consolidation may be done if it can close above micro support levels. \n\nIm not a financially literate to be a financial advisor, but just shooting blanks, i think. My mom told me I lost a chromosome when she was dividing me during mitosis phase.",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m going to go back a little bit in time and tell you how CLOV was directly related to GME squeeze.\nSo when GME was squeezing two very influential people have backed the squeeze and caused it to squeeze even more. Those two people were Elon Musk and Chamath Palihapitiya. Both partners in previous endeavors and friends. \nGME squeeze hurt short seller Hindenburg so much that they have lost 40% of their account that week. \nCLOV is backed by Chamath Palihapitiya. Hindenburg, in order to retaliate at Chamath for causing them huge losses, published a short seller report for CLOV few days after Chamath tweeted about GME. Short seller report had very little base, yet that caused the stock to drop and also SEC had to initiate an investigation due to the claims. \nSince then stock got beaten down to less than IPO prices. What does that mean? It means that it was moved not so much by true owners of the stock, but mostly by short sellers. That will play in nicely in the squeeze because short sellers always have to close out, but if stock is still held by their true purchasers it means that there are even less shares available for active trading. \n\n\n\nEnough of history. Retail following:\n\nSince GME endeavor Chamath PAlihapitiya joined the club of \u201cretail gods\u201d.... he is one of the poster babies for retail movement on hurting short sellers. His previous partnerships with Elon Musk furthers retail following so now not only we have GME crowd supporting Chamath, but also Tesla crowd. Both of those stocks were some of the most successful trades in history. \n\n\n\nFriday\u2019s Hindenburg\u2019s fright with CLOV:\n\nOn Friday CLOV has opened with 148% short interest and after this was noticed by retail the squeeze has started. The volume topped 250M shares traded (10x average daily volume and 5x its previous heaviest volume day). (Ill get in to more technicals later, but needed to mention this to push the narrative).\nHindenburg saw the action and protecting their possible short position tweeted that FactSet has misleading short interest data about CLOV not including CEOs clad B shares in the float. \nFactSet came back to Hindenburg\u2019s allegations with a reply that CEOs type B shares are classified as not tradable and are not included in the float. And once again confirmed that stock is 148% short.\nThis further angered retail traders and a lot of chatter online has started how Hindenburg is trying to manipulate this stock with lies and deceit. \nA lot of people didn\u2019t catch on on Friday but through the night and this afternoon Reddit and stock twits seem to have exploded about it, videos are popping up on YouTube. A lot of traction is being created over the weekend for a sweet Monday open. \n\n\n\nTechnicals:\n*CLOV free float is 109mil \n*CLOV shares outstanding are 406mil\n*78% of CLOV shares are owed by insiders and are still locked up. Insiders are only allowed to sell if stock hits $30 and stays above $30 for 90 days \n*institutional ownership of CLOV is at 48%\n\n*the volume on Friday was 249mil shares which only represents 61% turn over for shares outstanding, but if you take locked up shares out of consideration, true turn over was actually 228%, meaning every share available to trade was bought and sold at least twice on Friday. \n\nA lot of people that bought on Friday (including NEXT financial group that bought 21,400 shares) will not likely be actively trading this week meaning available shares short term will continue on decreasing.\n\nIn my speculation out of 109 mil free float Only around 35% of shares will be available to trade this week. Here is how I got to this number: \n-institutions owe 48% of stock and they are not likely to trade short term fluctuations, but giving it a benefit of doubt let\u2019s say that institutions that will hold account only to 30% of float. Now we only have 70% of float left to trade....\n-let\u2019s assume that investors that owe CLOV long term account for 20% of the float. A lot of them don\u2019t check stocks daily or sometimes even weekly. Let\u2019s assume that half of them even won\u2019t notice what is happening this week. At this point we only have 50% of float left to trade. \n-the rest of the free float is being traded by scalpers/ day traders, swing traders and \u201cdiamond handers\u201d. This is a very educated group and unless scalping or pattern trading will understand that we are in the middle of the squeeze and hold. I believe this group will contribute to another 15% of float being unavailable, assuming half of them will be trading fluctuations and half holding. \nSo my conclusion is: only 35% of available shares will be circulating next week being sold and bought over and over again. That\u2019s only 38mil shares not being stuck in someone\u2019s account semi permanently. Some more liquidity will be provided short term by other shorters flocking in, but I won\u2019t take them in consideration because they too have to close out at some point. \n\nFallowing all this speculative, yet very carefully vetted math let\u2019s calculate the demand for the shares, just to close short positions\n-148% of the free float is shorted, meaning 161mil shares will be in demand just to close out short positions. Since we already established that there will be only 38mil shares freely circulating in the market each short share will only have 0.24 shares. So looks like there are 4 times less shares than demand to close short positions! Throw in some buying activity to that math and you have a number closer to 10:1. \n\nFollowing all of that the question is how far the stock can go during this particular squeeze? Well the answer is: it\u2019s mathematically impossible to calculate. Although there are some indicators of what people can expect. Smaller the float, the bigger the short interest and the heavier the volume the further it can go. In this particular instance we have the combination of all three factors. Even if it\u2019s impossible to predict exactly what price short squeeze will hit, it\u2019s possible to trade short squeeze well using technical indicators and trade management. Monitoring volume, daily short interest and days to cover should be adequate. To know when short squeeze is ending I monitor same indicators that made me spot the short squeeze to start with, but in reverse. Meaning volume will start to tapper off, short percentage decrease and the upwards momentum will start to whilt. I also watch out for extremely sudden, needle like falls (trailing stop loss domino effect). \n\nI hope the read was interesting and I haven\u2019t lost you half way through. \n\nI won\u2019t go into any CLOV fundamentals or any of that good stuff cause I think we already established that everything is in order there. It is also completely irrelevant in a mathematical squeeze.",

        "selftext": "[Interview with Mindmed CEO](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/mindmed-ceo-going-public-allocate-184100037.html)\n\nSome takeaway from the interview:\n\n\u201cSo big debut on the NASDAQ today, but I'm looking at the stock and it's down 26%. So take us through what's going in your mind right now?\u201d\n\nJR RAHN: Well, look, I think we had a massive run-up on Friday and also on Monday. This was a very hotly-anticipated listing by many of our shareholders. And so I think now that we are on NASDAQ, we're going to start to see a little bit of some stability here today. It seems to be re-tracing a bit. But you know, this isn't just about share price. This is really about-- NASDAQ is about, how do we allocate capital to mental health?\n\nAnd how do we build an entire new industry? These are still very early innings for us. And so we're not going to be dictated by the day-to-day fluctuations or hour-by-hout fluctuations of our stock. We have 180,000 shareholders last time I checked, and a lot of them are very mission-driven. I think, yes, they are interested in investing into us for gains, but I think, importantly, a lot of them share what 40% of the US currently shares, which is that they have a form of mental illness or addiction at the moment.\n\nAnd so this is not just about investing. This is about investing in a company that is going to have a large impact on society. And that really is our mission.\n\n\u201cYou mentioned your investor base-- you've got some pretty passionate investors there. And I understand you're also trending on WallStreetBets today-- not quite sure if investors are seeing MindMed as one of those meme-type stocks like we saw with AMC and GameStop. But what's your take on what you're seeing happening sort of at the grassroots level with investors-- with individual investors and your company right now?\u201d\n\nJR RAHN: Well, these are chaotic times. And when you have chaotic times, both in the markets and in society, mental health is a big component and a problem that needs to be looked at. I think our being mentioned in WallStreetBets and on our MindMed investors club-- this is just a natural outcry from normal people that want to see a change in mental health. And suddenly, they can identify with something.\n\nI think it's great. I love to have empowered and passionate shareholders. We're very, very receptive and supportive. And you know, I think there's been a lot of hype around WallStreetBets, and meme stocks, and all of these things. But at the end of the day, people make markets. And it's great to have the people behind us.",

        "selftext": "I am a simple man. I see a stock, I buy it. I've bought into some of the most valuable stocks in my time, and I've noticed I have a certain special ability that might be of use here at r/wallstreetbets. It doesn't matter what it is, or what it's actually worth, I can make any stock go down just by buying/showing interest in it.\n\nJust as a sample, here are all of the stocks I have currently been sequestering. You might find this explains the unusually bearish behavior you've been seeing in the market:\n\nVism: 1000 shares, cost .049, price is now .011\n\nHCMC: 20000 shares, cost .00269, price is now .0014\n\nGME: 60 shares, cost 207.49, price is now 159.00\n\nAMC: 100 shares, cost 11.93, price is now 9.23\n\nTAN: 8 shares, cost 103.61, price is now 82.29\n\nOGI: 325 shares, cost 2.90, price is now 2.34\n\nAPHA: 210 shares, cost 16.17, price is now 13.14\n\nOCGN: 10 shares, cost 6.47, price is now 5.38\n\nSNDL: 325 shares, cost .97, price is now .84\n\nACB: 25 shares, cost 7.83, price is now 7.66\n\nTSLA: 1 share, cost 723.12, price is now 712.39\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's not all! Some of the other bullish stocks I've managed to chop off at the knee are:\n\nPLTR , VOO, VT, SPY, SSY, TELL, UAVS, UBER, RKT, SDGR, QQQ, MSFT, AAPL, XRT, and YOLO. As a secondary power, I've noticed that each one has seen at least a little spike in price since my selling. It's only cheap for as long as I own it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I'd failed at an investment in just a few of these stocks, I'd call it a fluke, but my investment history has a loss rate sitting at somewhere around 95%. That's not chance, that's certainty. That's fate. I'd bet my life on those kinds of odds. That's not bad luck, that's a goddamn super-power.\n\nI understand that some of you may be skeptical, so I've decided to take this opportunity to run a real-life, superb experiment to see if I'm incompetent, or have reverse-control over reality. Recommend any stock of reasonable price, and I will buy in first thing tomorrow morning (I'll try to give y'all time to liquidate your own shares first, but sometimes just my intention to buy something will make the price start to plummet). If my powers are correct, we should see a massive dip in that stock within a week. After a week, I will sell, and the stock should return to normal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf this does turn out to be a predictable trend, I would be happy to render my services. The way I see it, here's the plan:\n\n1) Pick Stock\n\n2) Pick Entry Time\n\n3) I will buy a MASSIVE amount of stock 1 week prior. This guarantees a daily loss in value. The bear attack will likely lose 50% of its momentum each day, so a 5 day run will be most effective before value is dropping too slowly to be worth it.\n\n4) Everyone buys in at market open the following day. 1hr into market open, I will liquidate shares, ensuring a bull run so strong that each and every one of you will become a millionaire. This bull run lasts as long as the stock holds my attention, likely another 5 days.\n\n5) Each of you contributes 1% of your earnings to a kickstarter, which will then be used to rescue me from the excruciating losses I am bound to continue suffering.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know what you think, apes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr Pick a stock, I'll buy it and we'll see if it shits the bed within a week.",

        "selftext": "Remember when GameStop mentioned it would sell a maximum of 3,500,000 shares, or $1bln, whichever came first? Many did some reverse maths and determined they *MUST* expect the share price to hit $1b/3.5m=**$285.71428571**. Others said \"or just 1m shares at $1,000 each.\" Still others (now this is the group I belong to) said this means fuck all for price expectations. This had nothing to do with GameStop peaking through the veil and determining a short squeeze was imminent and everything to do with seizing the opportunity to raise cash.\n\nWelp, the [3.5m shares came and went today](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestops-latest-big-day-picks-up-steam-after-hours-with-551-million-stock-offering-11619474789), and the price went UP.\n\n[Cramer actually sided with AMC and GameStop](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/06/jim-cramer-amc-gamestop-share-offerings-are-longterm-positives.html) about this being a good move, although we saw the sentiment on Reddit having great disdain for AMC's version (scummy CEO paying himself a fat bonus and taking credit when he did absolutely nothing) and overall the sentiment was a majority positive for GameStop and realizing RC's vision, although [GME stock price took a **-12% hit** when this was initially announced](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/05/gamestop-shares-drop-12percent-after-announcing-plan-to-sell-up-to-3point5-million-shares.html).\n\nGME is currently **up +12%** for the day (coincidence? *Cohencidence?*) and an additional +9% in AH with a peak that tickled the idea of breaking $200 at around... get ready for this... 4:20pm.",

        "selftext": "Posted by Nova &amp; Carob \n\nTo be clear from the inception of this DD, the purpose here is to shine a light on Hedge Funds and companies that are shorting AMC/GME and/or buying puts against AMC/GME. This light comes from a private community of Apes that have been looking very closely into the activities and inner workings of Citadel and friends. Our community intends to be as transparent as possible with everyape in our family, so we have made a unanimous decision to come forward here in this DD to all of you. We have coined the name The ApesOnWallStreet and before getting into the really good stuff we, Nova and Carob, want to personally provide some information about the Apes in our community. \n\nAnd a small message from Carob; I\u2019m good apes, thank you for your support, hope you enjoy reading our findings.\n\n**The ApesOnWallStreet** \n\n* We are a group of a few Apes that have been talking behind the scenes and merging the few wrinkles on our brains to form one very, very wrinkly Ape mind. The present goal is to create, review, and assist with DD\u2019s to help the Ape community grow in knowledge!\n* I personally am extremely grateful for this opportunity to be a voice against the players trying to manipulate the system. I speak for all of us when I say how grateful we are, to all of you who read our DD\u2019s and for all of your support. Every message, every upvote, every sentiment of encouragement expressed just reinforces our dedication to all of you and our drive to learn &amp; uncover more. \n\nI, Nova, The Student of Psychology, have nothing but the utmost love for every single ape, for all the huddled masses and for everyone struggling in this extremely complicated world of ours.\n\nWe were brought together by Moczak9, who read all of our DD\u2019s and reached out to all of us to bring us together in the belief that we could be a stronger force united. So far, I think he was right. I personally, am extremely grateful to him for this opportunity to be a powerful weapon against a very devious enemy. I personally never imagined that I would ever be part of something like this and now, honestly, I can\u2019t imagine a world without all of you. \n\n# Reddit Usernames ;\n\nu/TheNovaeterrae \n\nu/moczak9 (Founder) \n\nu/-Amewthyst- \n\nu/FuckYouWithAloha \n\nu/umu68 \n\nu/autistic-lord \n\nu/Horror_Carob2817 \n\nu/GGGGG\n\n**Now, let\u2019s get to the juicy part**. You all know I, Nova, love my links and this DD will be full of them. We will only include information that is readily accessible to everyape. No speculation. No opinions. I may include a small motivational speech because I have a need to add at least a dash of emotion into everything I do. It\u2019s my empathy that gives me my greatest strengths as a human being and I am so much less than I am, without that. But most of this will be facts. And links. And pictures. From the links. I hope this helps. \n\n# PART A. THE CONNECTION BETWEEN VIJAYABALAN MURUGESU OR (BALAN FOR THOSE WHO CAN\u2019T PRONOUNCE HIS NAME) AND CITADEL;\n\nNow, most of you might be wondering who is Balan? He isn\u2019t mentioned anywhere on any other DD or anything we\u2019ve seen that has to do with AMC, GME or Citadel. Well, hold onto your seats. \n\nThis is Balan. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rkar9fxiekt61.png?width=225&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77cbe0cd31beea4e14b20e00da9016ddb67e5670\n\nLink: Where we found his face. \n\n[https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2005/06/12/global-malaysians-network-spreading-afar](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2005/06/12/global-malaysians-network-spreading-afar)\n\nIf we start pulling the thread on Balan, you may first encounter Offshoreleaks. On offshore leaks you\u2019ll find 3 entities, all of which are named Redmile. I included a picture below. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rhz7tlyjekt61.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ed5b9e1afcbdd864c7c80a35c67cb621923edbc\n\nIf you then search for Redmile, you may encounter the following SEC Report. \n\n( Link: [https://sec.report/Document/0001472225-13-000001/](https://sec.report/Document/0001472225-13-000001/) )\n\nHere I want to show you the Form D/A Redmile Strategic Offshore Fund, Ltd D/A \\[Amend\\] - Notice of Exempt Offering of Securities. This was published January 25th, 2013 at 17:42:45. It was submitted on January 28th, 2013. The filing agent is RedMile Ventures, LTD. Now upon opening this SEC Report, the first message you will see is that \u201cThe Securities and Exchange Commission has not necessarily reviewed the information in this filing and has not determined if it is accurate and complete. The reader should not assume that the information is accurate and complete.\u201d \n\nMake of that what you will. \n\nThe jurisdiction here is the Cayman Islands. You\u2019ll see this location quite a few times as you look into Redmile. The reason being, is that the Cayman Islands are Balan\u2019s and Ken\u2019s wet dream palace. Gross, I know. And sorry, that is an opinion, someone might be into that, who knows? Anyway, the Cayman Islands is well known as one of the best tax havens of the world. According to Claire Boyte-White\u2019s article, titled \u201cWhy Are the Cayman Islands Considered a Tax Haven\u201d on Investopedia; \u201cUnlike most countries, the Caymans don\u2019t have a corporate tax which is a tax on the profits of a corporation\u201d. This makes it an incredible place for multinational corporations to base subsidiary entities which then act as shields to some or ALL of their incomes from taxation. I\u2019ve included a link below so you can read all about it. \n\n( Link: [https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100215/why-cayman-islands-considered-tax-haven.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100215/why-cayman-islands-considered-tax-haven.asp) )\n\nNow as you look into Redmile eventually you\u2019ll also notice the name of Jeremy Green. He is noted as the executive officer of Redmile Group, LLC, the Investment Manager of the Issuer. Here\u2019s his face. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5a82pqfvekt61.png?width=263&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bebc908a5ee50d57fd667471ac00c5842ce809f1\n\nLink: As a favor to you all, we will not lead you to where we found his face. You\u2019ve seen enough. \n\nNow according to Fintel, \u201cRedmile Group, LLC has disclosed 87 total holdings in their latest SEC filings. \n\nMost recent portfolio value is calculated to be $ 8,258,586,000 USD.\u201d \n\nThis Fintel link has more information here about actual assets under management and so on -&gt; [https://fintel.io/i/redmile-group-llc](https://fintel.io/i/redmile-group-llc) \n\nBut they only matter to me for one peculiar reason. Which is this link - &gt; [http://lacapitalmanagement.com/6pp3bl9m/redmile-group-founder-4f87bf](http://lacapitalmanagement.com/6pp3bl9m/redmile-group-founder-4f87bf) \n\nDon\u2019t worry Andrew, I won\u2019t make you click the link. I know you don\u2019t want to do all that so I\u2019ll make life easier for you and all of the Apes watching your video because I love all of you so much (there go those freaking emotions again). In the link you will find \u201cAdditional Series B investors included *Westlake Village BioPartners*, Kleiner Perkins, Cowen Healthcare Investments, *Acorn Bioventures,* HBM Partners, Perceptive Advisors, and **Surveyor Capital (a Citadel company)**\u201d. \n\nKen\u2019s Stupid Face. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img mtkpn1kwekt61...*\n\n**Redmile Special Opportunities Fund LTD** \n\nIn between the years of 2019-2021 - Redmile profits skyrocketed. During a pandemic. Their profits...skyrocketed. So while everyone else was losing money, theirs Skyrocketed. If you are still confused, here is a graph to display this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9obd70qxekt61.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e0e042b6cbc0a44704cd4c9a48fceaa3389d312\n\nThe graph can be found on this link that was provided to us by our very own, Lisbeth Salander AKA Amewthyst - &gt; [https://aum13f.com/fund/redmile-special-opportunities-fund-ltd](https://aum13f.com/fund/redmile-special-opportunities-fund-ltd)\n\nAs an added tidbit, Custodians listed under Fund Details include the following\u2026 \n\nThe Northern Trust International Banking Corporation, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co LLC, Morgan Stanley Institutional Liquidity Funds c/o Morgan Stanley Services Company Inc, JP Morgan Clearing Corp, JP Morgan Securities LLC, Morgan Stanley Private Bank National Association. \n\n# PART B. Balan and his HedgeFund friends;\n\nLet\u2019s face it, what would a world be for Balan if he only had one HedgeFund friend? That\u2019d probably be so empty, so lonely. That cannot be. Balan and Ken need friends. So we are going to dive into what Hedge Funds Balan is actually connected to, and it is a ton, probably even more than we were able to find. \n\n*Broad peak fund II LTD.;* \n\nA Singapore based company named Broad Peak Fund is connected to Balan, in the Caymans and others from there. ( Link: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1743736/000174373619000002/xslFormDX01/primary\\_doc.xml](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1743736/000174373619000002/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml) ). This company is based in several locations, the locations being; Singapore, Oregon and the Grand Cayman. A man named Syed Hyder Ahmad ( we will call him SHA for short ) is also connected to this company through the SingaPore based firm. Now you may ask who this is man? Well, this man is the founder of this company, Broad Peak Fund, but he founded it after he had resigned from his post from another well known company you might possibly recognize, ***Goldman Sachs***. He was the Co-Head of securities for Asia, after he resigned from his position he went on and started Broad Peak Investments, and of course, as we all could\u2019ve guessed, Goldman Sachs is also on the list of custodians. \n\n[https://www.globalcustodian.com/goldman-sachs-director-resigns-to-reportedly-start-his-own-asian-hedge-fund/](https://www.globalcustodian.com/goldman-sachs-director-resigns-to-reportedly-start-his-own-asian-hedge-fund/)\n\n*Pura Vida Investments LLC;*\n\nPura Vida being the name of the onshore company based in the US, they have an offshore fund that is called Pura Vida Offshore fund ONE, get it? The ONE because there are multiple -\\_-  Just like the other funds that Balan is connected to, this offshore fund is also based in the Caymans. The offshore funds are runned by; Ballan, Martin Laidlaw and Philip Hughes. We will call them the *Trio of Trouble* from now on. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll love that. \n\n1: [https://sec.report/CIK/0001637529](https://sec.report/CIK/0001637529) 2: [https://sec.report/CIK/0001774263](https://sec.report/CIK/0001774263) \n\n*140Summer partners LP;*\n\nAnd yet again another US based Hedge Fund that is associated with Balan! They own 3 onshore funds under the name 140 Summer Partners Onshore, 140 Summer Partners LP and 140 Summer Partners Fund GP LLC. For these 3 onshore funds they also own 2 offshore funds under the names; 140 Summer Partners Offshore LTD and Summer Partners Master fund. The Offshore funds have only posted a Securities offering once, now this isn\u2019t something to worry about since they have been in business for only a year. The company has a total of assets under management (AUM) of around $2.6 Billion in their first year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wlnbsy50fkt61.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=447ac94fe0ab60d1c520f7cea205c894e3d5ce3d\n\nYou see that perfectly normal rising line in every single chart? Yeah we do as well, this isn\u2019t normal stuff unless some bigger company decided to invest in them and gave them a boat load of money.\n\nConveniently enough they have sold the biggest amount of their assets through the fund in the Caymans. The onshore fund sold assets as well, but it was 30% less than what we are seeing in the Caymans.The only thing that the Fund in the Caymans has done is sell their securities, nothing else has been reported from there, *how convenient.*  [https://sec.report/CIK/0001813446](https://sec.report/CIK/0001813446) \n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9l0nmab1fkt61.png?width=422&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9b7245f0a82b5b02da9e1ac29021fe7a6a0101b\n\n*Pharo Trading Fund;*\n\nLast but not least for now is *Pharo trading fund*, this is a big company all around the world. So why did this spark our interest? It\u2019s not obviously not because Balan is on there because he obviously is. But the fact that the Pharo Trading Fund, LTD. based in the Caymans has only sold stock, for multiple years, I repeat, they have only sold stock but have never bought any ( At least not by filing them ). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/39hpkr72fkt61.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74c27defb5190296925c8e22476da57b4404e29c\n\nEvery single year they have offered securities/stock around the same time, the only year that stands out to us is the year of 2020 where they were 2 Months late when they previously never were. All of the directors got paid a nice bonus of $10k per person every single year for filing these reports.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9gv6w8l3fkt61.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b5dfc441a448cc53b30d981c4ca1374d04e6edc\n\nOur man Balan is on the board of directors for this company as well as; David Bree and Peter Rioda. Let\u2019s say that our man Balan has made a nice profit from only this company alone (around $100k), very lucrative business as you may see, and this is just one of the examples of many. \n\n[https://sec.report/Document/0001085146-19-001050/](https://sec.report/Document/0001085146-19-001050/) \n\n# Part C. THE ENEMY \n\nApes have really only been seriously fighting amongst each other on one thing. GME vs AMC. The great divide. The only thing that has seemingly separated apes is the fact that there are 2 stocks with incredible squeeze potential and because most of us are nerds, we believe that there can only be one. One stock to rule them all, one stock to find them, one stock to bring them all and...okay I\u2019ll stop, I\u2019ll stop\u2026\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b6h961z4fkt61.png?width=133&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfb3a9a75b2c9e05f620ed4efbab6ceb2507f058\n\nAND IN THE DARKNESS BIND THEM! I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t stop. You know that! You know that. But, I digress. Either way, you get it. Well, well, well, how we were all oh so wrong. Because the fact that there are 2 is exactly how we find the enemy. See the enemy of my enemy is my friend. And in this case, the enemy of AMC is also the enemy of GME. If you aren\u2019t following me here, I\u2019m saying that's the connection. These 2 stocks move together like a dance.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0vbrofu5fkt61.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b32ff1532c51491528cebd3aa128e3c3a6ebec1b\n\nSo stands to reason...that they share common enemies. Now, we\u2019re not going to completely release all their dirty secrets on this one DD but I have a feeling they\u2019re going to come across this. I just got a feeling. \n\nAnd I\u2019m curious how much of them are going to enjoy all the attention they have coming their way in future DD\u2019s. Here are a few of the names of companies that are interested in what AMC and GME are both doing as of late. \n\nMake of it what you will. \n\n[ADVISORNET FINANCIAL, INC](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/advisornet-financial-inc)**(PUT)** \n\n[SUSQUEHANNA INTERNATIONAL GROUP, LLP](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/susquehanna-international-group-llp)**(PUT) &amp; (CALL)**\n\n[**PRIVATE CAPITAL GROUP, LLC**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/private-capital-group-llc) **&amp;** [**PRIVATE ADVISOR GROUP, LLC**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/private-advisor-group-llc) **(PUT) &amp; (CALL)**\n\n[**FLAGSHIP PRIVATE WEALTH, LLC**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/flagship-private-wealth-llc)\n\n[**EVERENCE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT INC**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/menno-insurance-service-inc-dba-mma-capital-management)**(?)**\n\n[**DIMENSIONAL FUND ADVISORS LP**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/dimensional-fund-advisors-inc)**(?)**\n\n[**HUDSON BAY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT LP**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/hudson-bay-capital-management-l-p)**(?)**\n\n[**UBS ASSET MANAGEMENT AMERICAS INC**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/ubs-global-asset-management-americas-inc)**(?)**\n\n[**HSBC HOLDINGS PLC**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/hsbc-holdings-plc)**(?)**\n\n[**SCHRODER INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT GROUP**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/schroder-investment-management-group)**(?)**\n\n[**ALYESKA INVESTMENT GROUP, L.P.**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/alyeska-investment-group-l-p)**(?)**\n\n[**PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL GROUP INC**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/principal-financial-group-inc)\n\n[**SCULPTOR CAPITAL LP**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/oz-management-lp)**(PUT)&amp;(CALL)**\n\n[**JPMORGAN CHASE &amp; COMPANY**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/j-p-morgan-chase-co)**(D) ALL OF THE ABOVE**\n\n[**UBS OCONNOR LLC**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/ubs-oconnor-llc)**(PUT)**\n\n[**IMC-CHICAGO, LLC**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/imc-chicago-llc)**(PUT)&amp;(CALL)**\n\n[**CITADEL ADVISORS LLC**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/citadel-advisors-llc)**(D) ALL OF THE ABOVE**\n\n**(WILL ORGANIZE BETTER LATER WITH** **MUCH** **MORE DETAIL)**\n\nSo that\u2019s it.

Just, you know, to help out the SEC because they are just so busy these days, having to read and everything. Y\u2019know that\u2019s pretty new for them so we really just want to help out and we are very ready to take on these responsibilities.

Because even though we live in a Capitalist Society that serves as a breeding ground for corruption, I personally, prefer to look at it as a test of human virtue. Will a person try to create something that helps humanity regardless of how much they make? Will a person deny a Million dollars so his employees can all get better pay? Will a person hoard all the money they can while others struggle? Will a person choose the easy way to live, or the hard way? The moral way. In service of others. I personally think corruption has an expiration date. Maybe. I sure hope so. \n\nAlright, speech over. More links below. Links on links on links. And pictures.

Honest workers, Citadel doesn\u2019t care;\n\nSo you are an ape that has worked their entire life from 9 to 5, you have earned some good pension by now right? Well you do, but Citadel and other funds DO NOT care about that, by investing with brokers from the Caymans they don\u2019t have the protection that they do in the US. They do not care about losing retirement money, as long as it is in their best interest. They invest in risky businesses without having a good broker that has the same regulators as in the US.\n\nWe are talking about millions of dollars they are stealing from the pension funds, and no they do not care about this at all. Firefighters, hospital workers, teachers, they\u2019re basically scamming every single one of them for their own gains. They set these Shell funds up to protect themselves and nothing else. They care about 1 single person in the world and that is themself. So what is our duty now? Go out and show that this behaviour is no longer accepted, show them who's boss and that is US APES.[http://pensionpulse.blogspot.com/2017/11/the-grand-cayman-pension-scam.html](http://pensionpulse.blogspot.com/2017/11/the-grand-cayman-pension-scam.html) \n\nWe hope you all have enjoyed reading our research and this is only the surface that we\u2019re scraping right here.

        "selftext": "Hello my fellow retards, I have been a long-time lurker of this sub ever since I joined, but today I decided to bring you a TA DD as of 4/29/21 price action.\n\nAs of 4/29/21, CLOV opened at $11.22 and closed at $10.17 with previous closing price of $10.50 (-3.14%). Clearly, our positive momentum was beat down hard yesterday. This was most likely due to two possible reasons:\n\n* The market displayed a bearish sentiment in general against the medium/small/micro market caps while most of the large market caps was up (ex. FB) which explains why DOW, NASDAQ, and S&amp;P 500 were all up by EOD.\n* MVIS crashing hard which caused a ripple effect of panic selling across popular stocks like CLOV, AMC, GME, and MNMD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Daily chart of CLOV](https://preview.redd.it/byclt37gzaw61.png?width=3766&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=156907323ac0c10051c6051276d9d110e5c4640c)\n\n**Fibonacci retracements:**\n\nLooking at the chart above, Fibonacci retracements clearly show that we failed to cross over the 38.2% resistance level of $11.14 due to the reasons described from the previous paragraph. The 38.2% resistance level will be crucial heading into today's trading session as crossing over the resistance level would mean we have a high possibility of testing the next resistance level of 50% at $12.34.\n\nIf we continue a downward trend today (4/30/21) and go below the support line of $9.65, the 23.6% level will be shifted from being our support to a new resistance level. And of course, that's not a good sign since it would signify that there's a chance for us to reach back to the next support level of $8.53. Based on the historical trend, CLOV has been consolidating at around $8.53 and have been using $8.53 as a major support to bounce off so if this downward trend continues to spiral down, I would expect to see a bounce at $8.53 mark and rally back up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Elliott Wave Theory:**\n\nBased on the Elliott Wave Theory, with yesterday's candle, it seems like we are heading into wave 2 which is a corrective wave. Today's price action will confirm whether we are officially heading towards a wave 2 or not. If today's price action confirms that we are in wave 2, I do NOT expect to see CLOV dipping further than $8.53 based on the explanation provided from the Fibonacci section and expect to see a bounce and reversal pattern to wave 3. In contrast, if today's price action shows a positive momentum, this will be a bear trap which means shorts will get fucked even more.\n\nWith wave 3, I expect us to smash past 61.8% resistance level and face a major resistance test at $15.77 area. Wave 3 will be a key area for us to see how far our upside really is, but just know that if we smash past the resistance at $15.77, we will be able to test for 52-wk ATH price of $17.45 again. And if we cross over the 52-wk ATH price, sky is the limit for us and we are all going to the moon.\n\nAs for the other waves (wave 4 and wave 5), expect to see an eventual healthy pullback from wave 3 and literally launch off to the fucking Mars by wave 5. I'm going to guess that wave 5 will most likely occur after the Q1 Earnings which is May 17th. That would mean that we will see wave 2 and wave 4 happen within the next 2 weeks. So, expect our journey to the moon to be a bumpy ride but know that the chart is absolutely bullish for the take off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Other:**\n\n* Golden cross pattern detected on the daily chart, highly bullish sentiment.\n* RSI is centered out. Depending on today's (4/30) price action, we will find out if we are still in bullish sentiment or heading back to bearish sentiment based on RSI.\n* Daily MACD chart is still looking bullish as MACD line is still above the signal line, reinforces the idea that we are still in the bullish phase.\n* All around we are still seeing a lot of bullish indicators. Let's hope that yesterday's price action was a bear trap.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Yesterday \\(4\\/29\\)'s RSI](https://preview.redd.it/sgtfcpwmzaw61.png?width=1821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5639af2bdf2123a7210db78565f048c20597e3b2)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Daily MACD chart](https://preview.redd.it/mewjblapzaw61.png?width=3760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44d228a605326c92567cd38379f4ba73b3046f82)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll this speculation is contingent upon continuous increase in the volume level and buying pressure. Expect a bumpy ride, but based on my TA, we are primed to launch off hard. So, go tell your mom, your dad, your family relatives, and your friends to buy CLOV and hold instead of becoming paper hands and panic sell because if we hold, we are all going to the fucking moon.\n\n**Tl;dr: We are going to the fucking moon, don't be scared of the setbacks and don't panic sell.**\n\nP.S.

        "selftext": "At this point, seems a lot of people know about CLOV. Just so happens that the catalyst was a data error, but the opportunity is still quite strong even though the short interest isn't 144% of float. After all, it's now estimated at over 43%, making CLOV still one of the most shorted stocks in the entire market (if not THE most shorted stock).\n\nNow, I actually bought into this at $7 several weeks ago. I first became aware of CLOV in the midst of the January hype, but I don't like buying high, so I stayed away. Came back a few weeks later and started watching for bullish signs as it dropped, saw that sweeeet solid bounce happening after tapping $6.50, and bought in around $7 myself.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5v5jbsepycu61.png?width=1196&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8804c928fbb1e9bcff4269a4808a906c2ff376bb\n\nA few reasons for this initial bullishness from that point:\n\n* I think the \"DOJ Investigation\" accusations are a bunch of hogwash and were causing a temporary and factually empty hammering of the stock.\n* The average price target among analysts was at something like $13.50 at the time, with no analysts labeling it a sell. That is super promising for long-term holds.\n* The market opportunity itself. CLOV is one of those \"will make it big or will die trying\" kind of stocks. I think they can make it in the space, but it's uncertain enough to give fuel to detractors, keeping the price down until their results start showing.\n* The continued support shown around $7 weeks later just confirmed my bias, so I was watching closely to add to my position at the first sign of bullishness.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ebpjsdb00du61.png?width=198&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f114a359f0333b9f693cdcffefe1aee139e748d1\n\nNeedless to say, seemed like a home run, a nice value opportunity for a long-term hold. Then, I became aware of the short interest.\n\nFriday I saw my position exploding and had to look into why. Saw the 144% short interest report and increased my position by like 10x. This was no longer just a buy and hold for a high long-term gain, but could really explode up quickly! Turns out, the short interest wasn't quite accurate. But, ironically, this inaccurate short interest report actually did result from CLOV going from a top 10 short interest stock to quite possibly THE most shorted stock on the market in terms of float. Here's where it stands now according to Ortex. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g7oobj1tqdu61.png?width=331&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa2960f93772aaee400260dc35a6fcd12df4da54\n\nWith a 90% util rate, just about every share even available to be lent for shorts is taken up at this point. Shorts have basically maxed out their position, making up about 43% of the technical float. \n\nHowever, a large portion of the float is not actually \"available\". Given the information available on their most recent 10-K, it appears that roughly 87 million shares are owned by insiders/controlling investors. This leaves less than 60 million shares actually available for the \"real\" available float. This is likely why the util rate is at 90% despite less than half of the shares being on loan. We're at an \"effective\" short interest of roughly 75% and rising.\n\nY'all, I liked this stock before this whole thing, but now I love it. This is a pretty unique opportunity to squeeze some shorts. I don't want to say it's the \"next GME\", because obviously GME actually was shorted all the way past 100% of float and was a turnaround story itself. GME also took a super long time to actually take off and make that squeeze happen. I was in GME in Feb and March of 2020 and actually had sadly taken out my money when the stock hit like $24 in Dec (I never imagined it might go into the $40s, much less $400+).\n\nI don't see this as a \"turnaround story\" so much as a stock that has been massively underestimated by the market due to some hammering of Chamath and general SPAC distaste. For me, this is a value play that's been enhanced by the potential for a pretty massive short squeeze.\n\nFull disclosure, I currently hold:\n\n* 300 shares\n* One 21 May 7.5 C\n* One 18 Jun 7 C\n* One 20 Aug 12.5 C\n\nI'm also waiting on a deposit to clear, with which I plan to purchase a LEAP. I may roll my May call into something with a later expiry as well given how hard it can be to time these things.\n\nP.S. To top it all off, I'm a giant fan of the Wyckoff Method. The daily chart looks like a great Wyckoff setup right now, with today's pullback to the neckline area providing a promising potential LPS.",

        "selftext": "By now you have likely seen some $ASO talk. There are some other really good DD posts in WSB that cover different aspects of the stock. This post will break down why I'm bullish AF on ASO and why I believe that it could hit $60 or higher in the next few weeks. Before GME gang jumps down my throat, don't worry, I am still hodling. There are other stocks to make money on while that one consolidates and trades sideways for a little while. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR**: ASO looks a lot like RKT did in February when there was a massive spike. Short interest is high (may be over 45%) on a stock that has been steadily rising since its IPO in late 2020. They beat earnings expectations in a similar fashion to RKT (1.09 actual vs. 0.62 expected EPS = 76% beat). Undervalued stock that is primed for a squeeze means bears r fuk. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n  \nOk, for those of you apes with a few wrinkles, I will explain why you might be able to take your wife and her boyfriend and her parents to Red Lobster and order more than water and biscuits. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \n**2021 is the year of the squeezes and the SI% on this bad boy is HIGH**\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \nHedgies have shorted a wide swath of the market, with a focus on retailers. Makes sense, right? The pandemic has hit a lot of retailers hard, forcing a lot of store closures. Academy Sports &amp; Outdoors has been able to thrive through the pandemic for a few reasons: \n \n1. Their stores are mainly located in southern states whose COVID restrictions are far more lax than their northern counterparts. \n  \n2. Guns and ammo. There has been a massive pullback on offering guns and ammo by big box retailers due to a shift in public sentiment due to mass shootings. However, thanks to the pandemic and civil unrest, more people are buying guns than ever. ASO has not curtailed their gun and ammo offerings, which are a recession-proof sales channel right next to liquor.  \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \nRetailers have been shorted massively (see GME) with the shorts expecting that retail will die with the rise of online sales. Maybe they are right in the long term, but for now, people are still going to stores. Here in GA, you wouldn't know there is a pandemic if people weren't wearing masks. The mall parking lots are full. The short interest on ASO was 45.21% on 3/15 according to TD Ameritrade (compare that to 36.6% on RKT in late February). The stock is up 147% since its IPO in October 2020 without any significant dips, which tells us one thing: none of the shorts are in the money.  I first took interest in ASO about a month ago when I saw them at the top of the shorted list. Investing in stocks in January that had high short interest was quite lucrative for me, so I've been trying to continue investing in shorted stocks that appear to have a bright future. Because bears r fuk and squeezes are fun. \n   \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLet's look at the short interest over time for ASO: \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n|Report Date|Total Shares Sold Short|Dollar Volume Sold Short|Change from Previous Report|Percentage of Float Shorted|Days to Cover|Price on Report Date|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|3/15/2021|12,510,000 shares|$308.37 million|+0.8%|39.4%|9.1|$24.65|\n|2/26/2021|12,410,000 shares|$305.04 million|-3.0%|39.1%|8.3|$24.58|\n|2/12/2021|12,790,000 shares|$306.45 million|+24.5%|41.2%|8.9|$23.96|\n|1/29/2021|10,270,000 shares|$262.50 million|+10.1%|33.1%|7.3|$25.56|\n|1/15/2021|9,330,000 shares|$196.58 million|No Change|44.8%|8.4|$21.07|\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe can see that short interest has increased over time up to a high here of 39.4% on 3/15. TD Ameritrade says 45.21% and we know that short interest is not clear cut, so there is some variance on that  SI%. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMost shares were shorted between $21 - $25 and were still shorted on 3/15. What has happened to the price since 3/15? It was driven down to a low of $23.19. As seen on [this chart](https://i.imgur.com/yrwzR6R.jpg). This means that most of the shorts did not become profitable during the biggest drop since the latest SI% report and likely did not cover. There was another seemingly artificial drop on 3/31 down to $24.50 where some shorts may have covered which [I have put a little box around](https://imgur.com/lss7ppj). Why do I say that it is an artificial drop? Because the company absolutely crushed earnings expectations and was trending up the day earnings were released. That premarket drop was clearly induced and may have been an opportunity for some of the shorts to cover with a small profit, but certainly not the majority. I believe SI% is still very high and there is a **squeeze to be squoze**. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSome may attribute the drop in price on 3/31 to the **IPO lockup expiration**. If you don't know what lockup expiration means, \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n&gt;When a company goes public through a traditional IPO, it usually sets a lock-up period of 90 to 180 days during which insiders can't sell their shares. That rule isn't mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission -- it's a self-imposed one that prevents big investors from flooding the market with shares.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nSo, the lockup  expired and insiders can sell their shares, but why would they? They just beat earnings by a lot and should expect their shares to continue to increase in value. Also, there were further restrictions placed on insider sales that a commenter on another ASO DD thread made. I'm assuming it was valid research. Hopefully they can add it to this post because I don't have the full details, but essentially there is a still limit on how much the insiders can sell at one time as to no shift the price too much and that limit is 1% of the company's value. With a $2.64B market cap right now, that is $26.4M, or about 900,000 shares being the limit on insider sales in a day.  It is entirely possible that the lockup expiry was the cause of the 3/31 drop, which would mean that it was not artificial and it was not a plan by shorts to cover. Meaning SI% is still in the 35-45% range. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n**THE STOCK IS UNDERVALUED**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n[According to Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/results-academy-sports-outdoors-inc-052048433.html) the consensus price target is $32. [Simply Wall St](https://imgur.com/Y95DfqK) has a fair value estimate of $49.99. Prior to the company beating EPS expectations by 76%, I was seeing discounted cash flow values of $35/share. [GuruFocus has DCF value at $36.29](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/ASO/dcf). The price has been depressed. Watching the charts for the last month, there have been pretty massive sell walls in the $25 - $29 range, with order books full of those suspicious algorithm share #'s keeping the price from going up to its fair value naturally. With price targets that have not been fully updated for the earnings beat and increasing volume being between $28 - $35, it seems that the worst case scenario is buying in at $30 will net about a 10% gain or loss. That is attractive to boomers, which could increase retail volume.  \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDid someone say **volume**? Average volume was around 1.5M. Since earnings were released there has been an increase in volume: \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n|Date|Volume|Over/(Under) Average|\n--:|:--|:--|\n|26-Mar| 775,000| (725,000)|\n|29-Mar| 2,390,000| 890,000|\n|Earnings Release 30-Mar| 4,880,000| 3,380,000|\n|Lockup Expiry 31-Mar| 5,040,000| 3,540,000|\n|1-Apr| 3,610,000| 2,110,000|\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nPrice at open on the day of earnings release was $24.98. It closed on 4/1 at $29.01 for a 16% increase and kept going up after hours another $1 or another 4%. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLet's see that in a table: \n\n|Date|Open|Close|% Change since earnings||\n:--|--:|--:|--:|:--|\n|26-Mar|23.92|24.59|||\n|29-Mar|24.98|24.23|-3.0%||\n|30-Mar|24.59|26.74|7.0%||\n|31-Mar|25.79|27.05|8.3%||\n|1-Apr|27.08|29.01|16.1%||\n|After Hours|29.01|30.00|20.1%||\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nNow, I said previously that this stock reminds me of RKT. Strong earnings release for a heavily shorted stock and a delayed increase in price due to massive resistance. That resistance was overcome for RKT from massive buying volume as retail jumped on board. Volume really picked up and the RKT flew. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \n|Date|Open|Close|% Change since earnings|\n--:|--:|--:|--:|\n|25-Feb|20.33|19.9|-2.1%|\n|26-Feb|23.33|21.85|7.5%|\n|1-Mar|23|24.3|19.5%|\n|2-Mar|27.34|41.6|104.6%|\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \nI'm not saying that ASO will have a 100% gain this week, but if you look at what's been happening in 2021 (RKT, AMC, Discovery?), when a stock gets attention and momentum with a high SI%, it is entirely possible to jump 100% in a day. ASO seems similar to RKT in terms of having low float, high short interest, consistently beating earnings, and absolute price. The price point is really important here. Most jabronis can afford to buy into a $30 stock. \n  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Indicators** \n \nI don't put a ton of faith in traditional indicators because we live in the Upside Down now, but MACD and RSI both look very promising, with MACD [on the 3-month chart](https://imgur.com/unGgIgg) \"crossing over\" into positive territory on 3/30. This is a bullish sign for the chart watchers. RSI on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts is over 70. Also a bullish indicator. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n**Conclusion** \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFor me, personally, I think ASO is primed to have a big day this week if it volume gets high enough. By big day I mean spiking to anywhere from $45 - $60 before settling back into $35 - $40 and then slowly growing. If it goes any higher than $60 I will definitely be throwing a pizza party for my local store. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \n\nThanks for reading my post. Good luck out there.

        "selftext": "Alright retards, here\u2019s a DD that contains no technical analysis because if this company had good technical\u2019s it wouldn\u2019t be a sleeper. This is a social arbitrage DD. Also, I don't care about how many micro-brews you have in your town. Beer is somewhat irrelevant to this play.\n\nMiller-Coors is no longer the piss beer coors brand that your drunk uncle remembers. It\u2019s now a company that\u2019s woken up from the dead with new leadership and rollout of fantastic products. They have focused on a completely new product lineup, that involves seltzers, energy drinks, THC beverage\u2019s, and a \"beyond beer\" segment. Couple all these new products with the lockdowns ending globally and you are going to have a monster Q2/Q3 earnings report. Not to mention this stock is beat down so much from wall street it\u2019s a asymmetric trade as it stands right now.\n\nFirst off, wall street fucking hates this company and for good reason. The past 7 years they were stagnant and failed to adapt to new markets/trends. They took on billions of debt to purchase SABmiller. Another shit beer company that wasn\u2019t doing shit. The beauty of this is that wall street is frozen and is going to be late to the party when they get smacked in the dick with earnings for Q2 and Q3 of this year. They have a wait and see attitude to towards this company and they will be forced to pile on once they see the results from the new products miller-coors has deployed.\n\nTo name a few:\n\n* Topo Chico Hard Seltzer: Owned by coke but Miller- coors has exclusive manufacturing, distribution and marketing rights. This new seltzer is the hotness on the streets right now. It had a soft launch 3 weeks ago in 9 states and it already has over 3% of the seltzer market. Go out and pick some up(if its not sold out everywhere) and I promise you you\u2019ll be throwing your life savings into this company on Monday morning.\n* Zoa: New energy drink from the Rock. Who knows how this is going to sell but with the Rock pushing this to his tens of millions of social media followers, im sure it\u2019ll do just fine. I've spoken to a health store(cant name it here because of the automods) rep who have said this is selling as well as redbull and monster.\n* Light Sky: One of the best if not best light beers out there. Its blue moons light offering. Go check it out, it\u2019s a crushable summer beer. Perhaps the best light beer on the market right now.\n* Yuengling: Signed distribution rights to expand the company to the West Coast.\n* Vizzy Hard Seltzer: Another new solid seltzer offering. Has vitamin-c and shit that all the crunchies like. Also has great taste and flavors.\n* Coors Seltzer: Not sure who buys this but I heard its selling really well. Just glad the company has many different seltzer offerings now.\n* Truss Beverage: THC infused beverage offering that\u2019s killing it in Canada and has plans to expand to the US.\n* [Beyond beer hub](https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2021/04/08/Molson-Coors-launches-Beverage-Hub-for-beyond-beer-beverages): This is super exciting. Miller-coors has been bleeding out the past 10 years because they failed to adapt to new and emerging markets. This endeavor will enable them to be on the cutting edge of any trend that is emerging. Just think, if this company got into seltzers when it was starting to materialize 4 years ago, the stock prices would be well over $100/share minimum. With this hub you can be sure that Miller-Coors will never miss an opportunity like that again.\n\nThe Selzer game is absolutely huge for this company. This is a main pillar of the company\u2019s revitalization. The seltzer market is doubling every year and theres projections TAP will take a minimum of 10-15% of the market with Topo Chico and Vizzy alone. That is hundreds of millions to billions in revenue for a company that only has a 10B market cap. This can easily drive this stock price up by multiples.\n\nCheck out this quote from an insider: \u201cJust talked with a 10 year brewer in Milwaukee with coors- moors, extremely bullish conversation overall. Coors seltzer is see high sell through, heard vizzy is selling well, he brews light sky and blue moon, said sell through has been amazing, told me the company acquired/did a deal with columbay(?) For a hard coffee drink, he raved about the sampler packs they got, and extremely good initial response from that, rolling that out soon but didn\u2019t know timeline, he\u2019s heard topo is flying, the whole company is buzzing, but didn\u2019t know much beyond that. Said his factory laid 200 people off start of 2020, and have now hired back 350. He was extremely enthusiastic. Overall said in his ten years he\u2019s never seen coors do so well. Very confident in management and direction\u201d.\n\nAll of these solid new product additions coupled with the US coming out of lockdown and they are going to blow the tits off earnings Q2 and Q3. I expect the earnings call this week to be terrible for Q1 due to lockdowns and a cyber attack that stalled beverage production. Good time to jump in.\n\nTLDR: Revitalized company with new leadership, fantastic new diverse product offerings coupled with ending lockdowns will be rocket fuel for this company. Q1 earnings will suck because of the lockdowns and cyber-attack disrupting production but Q2 and Q3 will blow the tits off wallstreet. In my opinion the Q1 report will give us all a solid price to buy in. $SAM 6X in 3 years and I expect similar performance or better here. The stock is so beaten down from the past 5 years it's a safe asymmetric play with incredible upside potential. Even Michael Burry owns this. But he'll probably sell out before it rockets like GameStop because he's a boomer.\n\nMy Position: 20 $47C, 30 $70C, and 769 Shares(Buying after earnings 5/29)",

        "selftext": "I recently tried to estimate the amount of shares of GME owned in different subreddits and I remembered this post in February by u/cockspicuous who made a website where you can enter the GME shares you own, with a picture as proof.\n\nI gathered and loaded this data in a spreadsheet that you can access [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-JEVNbM-_3Wy0VZ04QXVeqs1dkfBZNAEMLphXWfdAxY/edit#gid=0).\n\nI then grouped the data between different shareholder groups.\n\n[Screenshot of the spreadsheet](https://preview.redd.it/sd2tr2qwpcv61.png?width=870&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=392acfd98481d05fb5e7928e9916249e3a71fa4e)\n\nThe main element to notice here is that even though X and XX holders represent 77% of total reported shareholders, they only hold 7.2% of total shares. Particularly the XXXX holder group is quite impressive since **they represent** **only 3.5% of the apes but they own 43% of total reported ownership!**\n\nThis has the effect to raise the average of shares owned by each ape to an impressive **215 shares/ape**.\n\nI believe that the amount of shares owned by bigger apes is largely underestimated.\n\nI also made a more fine tuned graph out of the gathered data :\n\n[Pretty good looking results !](https://preview.redd.it/6kps4vktlcv61.png?width=820&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5938629fa9680999a058f7067c800b48dcbcd5fb)\n\nTo explain briefly the X-axis is divided between a set of range of share going from 0-1 to 131K+. The blue columns are the amount of apes holding the corresponding share range, and the red columns are the amount of shares held in the corresponding share range.\n\nFor example for the range 64-128 : this means there are about 250 apes who reported holding between 64 and 128 shares for a total of 100\\*250 = 25 000 shares held (I scaled it down so it looks good).\n\nWhat makes me trust the data reported is that it looks like a nice looking log-normal distribution. Although we can see that the end of the shares held data is bumpy. The reason is because DFV's 50k reported shares are a bit of an anomaly in the distribution. We will come back to it later.\n\nNow let's apply this distribution to r/wallstreetbets.\n\nThe website advertisement was posted on WSB the 3rd of February soon after the subscriber count went up to 8 millions degenerates which is the number I used. The only number we don't have data about is the percentage of apes holding GME shares in WSB. I arbitrarily set it to 60% because it is the most popular stock in here and it seems like a reasonable number.\n\nHere is the result :\n\n[Uuuh](https://preview.redd.it/k9h56m85vcv61.png?width=875&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7462e336b479729785ce851eef459e5e3d5799a6)\n\nHOLY SHIT ! ONE BILLION SHARES !\n\nIs that even possible ? There has to be an error somewhere right ? We probably overestimated something. Let's try to make this number go as low as possible. First thing we can do is to remove the DFV anomaly. And while we're at it let's remove the 6 bigger shareholders from the result so that we're sure there can't be any overestimation. We now get :\n\n[Only 800M. Phew, Ken is saved !](https://preview.redd.it/4i06juhy1dv61.png?width=876&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3417133484bb258fea703e6b938582f11591348)\n\nGreat, retail now only owns 3000% of the float.\n\nLet's be more aggressive and assume WSB January's 6 new millions subscribers did it just to hit up on your wife's bf, and don't actually own any GME share. We set wallstreetbets degenerates counter to 2 million and get :\n\n[200M. I'm not sure if shorting it more is gonna solve the problem Ken...](https://preview.redd.it/rzgiyz564dv61.png?width=437&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10dfb48a36f131d97a6b12b90256a0c24fe6717c)\n\nEven if we estimate that only 30% of these 2M apes own GME, that would still be 100M shares which is way more than the 13 millions retail ownership we've been seeing.\n\nEven making ridiculously low estimations we still get insanely high results. On top of that the data is from around 4th of February and OBV has gone up since then. I went from X shares to now XXX shares, DFV quadrupled down, WSB sub count is now at 10M and we just kept buying.\n\nPlease let me know if you see any mistakes in my math, but to be honest I'm starting to think it's not impossible that the 1 billion number is real. I just can't find a way to make it go to a reasonable number based on the data, and if they can cheat to such level, they might as well cheat up to 1 billion. \n\nEither way get ready for the biggest squeeze ever.\n\n**TL;DR : Influence of bigger apes on the amount of shares is underestimated. WSB apes could even own 1B shares, and at the very least 100M based on what looks like a good quality sample.**",

        "selftext": "The moderation pendulum swings all over the place, but I fear it's a bit too far on constricting right now.  We haven't actually changed any of our base rules, but have tightened up on some in the post GME deluge of dumb posts. \n\nI know /u/greytoc just made a post on DD guidelines, we're just about ready to roll out some new firm guidelines on what DD is appropriate and what is not.  So stay tuned for that.  \n\nSo, that said the volume of posts has decreased significantly here, a lot are being removed for very good reasons, but we're still thinking of ways to strike a nice balance (to be clear - quality of discussion is and will continue to be our primary goal with any rule).  I regularly check the automod removal logs and 99% of the posts being removed are frankly just really generic advice requests or basic questions. \n\nThat said, I'd like to formulate some formal guidelines for differentiating between a post that should be in a daily thread and one that can have it's own thread.  I'd like for sufficiently complex topics to be able to generate insightful discussion - this is an inherently subjective threshold so someone's gonna be mad about their post not making the cut, but I think formalizing some guidelines should help.  \n\nSo, I was discussing this with /u/Emc87, and our initial thoughts were something along the lines of this: if you can google the answer to something it should not be a post here.  But if you can demonstrate that you have done a fair bit of research on something and are having trouble connecting the dots, or having trouble seeing the mechanics behind a concept, then that would likely be a good post to open up for discussion.  \n\nThis obviously creates a lot of room for interpretation - I've seen enough people in modmail arguing that \"how do I buy stock\" is a valid discussion topic that would help many people to know that we're not going to make everyone happy here.  But I would like to see what thoughts everyone has as to putting a semi-formal framework on these ideas, so that we can point to something when deciding which posts will be sent to the daily threads and which can have their own post.",

        "selftext": "CLOV has a very interesting setup right now but way too many people seem to only care about the short float debate that has been unfolding over the last few days. To sum that up: FactSet (top financial data provider) had the CLOV float listed as 23.5M and short interest at 39M - putting the percentage of the float shorted at 146.6%. This circulated online and has been argued on twitter and reddit starting Friday. Factset has since updated the float to 109.8M making the 39M short interest account for 36% of the float. They previously had deducted the CEO\u2019s class B shares from the total class A shares, and although his shares are \u201cnon-tradeable\u201d and shouldn't be included in the public float, they were only using the class A shares to determine the float as all class B shares are already non-tradeable unless converted - so shouldn\u2019t have been part of the equation to begin with. Now I could get more into the \u2018Hindenberg said this\u201d and \u201cS3 said this\u201d bullshit that people have been arguing about...\n\nBut heres why NONE OF THAT EVEN FUCKING MATTERS\n\nShorts and those who have been bashing CLOV and arguing against the original short float number are taking a victory lap, like Factset updating the short float to 36% destroys the entire bullish case for CLOV and now it will tank. BULLSHIT, here\u2019s why:\n\nThe 39M short interest number being used in the short float calculation is from 3/31. Over two weeks ago. When the two highest volume and highest short volume days in CLOV history have occurred within the last two weeks. With \\~30M shares shorted on 4/8 and \\~90M shares shorted on Friday (according to Fintel). We don\u2019t know at this time how much of the short volume has since covered and would be included in the current short interest; but given all this, you could logically conclude the short float on CLOV right now could be pretty damn high. For context, 36% short float - based on outdated short interest from 3/31 - is in the ballpark of double what we're currently seeing in GME or AMC, and would still make CLOV one of the highest short float stocks in the entire market right now.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rvr4bslwszt61.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=801f7c4f339e3573272d280586c7a9bd54d8343d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l4ssab8yszt61.png?width=2010&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10de1da2465f375d84f5d28bdf9689936cf5af48\n\nThe short float is only a small piece of the puzzle, and it\u2019s without a doubt high enough to trigger a short squeeze if prices continue to rise, end of story. Now let\u2019s get into the shit that really matters.\n\nFirst off, from a technical perspective, there are some good signs. (if you hate technical analysis or think you're so good at it that you'll find a way to disagree with whatever I say then skip to the next section)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/06weuky6tzt61.png?width=1125&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64b8a0b9d28d85d079627746c4e1832aec8f153e\n\n* MACD bullish\n* RSI only starting to warm up\n* Decent support built between $7-$7.30\n* But what\u2019s really screaming on this chart are these two recent MASSIVE buying volume days coming after about a month of consolidation with a double bottom pattern making higher lows.\n\n**Now let\u2019s get into call volume**\n\n[Some of the order that came through Friday](https://preview.redd.it/ksveumt0tzt61.png?width=1108&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2577d77bf9ab0d6f3180c955e9af5b861f859f3b)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a7e1pes3tzt61.png?width=730&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83c9ea5a0d92808cfd65626f792fa1078443b1ed\n\nFridays call flow and the sheer volume and open interest on some of these call options speak for themselves. This is where I should break down the mechanics of a gamma squeeze, but really all you need to know is that heavy call volume is important for two reasons: 1) it can be a good indicator of where money is flowing in the market and 2) the people who write the call options need to buy shares to hedge against their position. The more the price rises the more shares they need to buy, helping to push price higher just like we see in a short squeeze.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext, CLOV is down over 50% from Dec/Jan highs. Some of the main reasons for the drop would be:\n\n* Money flowing out of growth stocks and SPACS\n* Hindenberg short report\n* Short seller price manipulation\n\nThe Hindenburg short attack really did a number on CLOV. The stock was trading at about $14 prior to the release of their short report and dropped over 50% in the weeks following its release.\n\nHindenburg attacked CLOV from many different angles. One of their main arguments being that Clover Health uses misleading and unethical marketing practices to boost sales, as evidence stating that in 2016: \u201cClover was fined for misleading marketing practices by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS)\u201d\n\nWell, just this month (April 8th), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services granted Clover heath approval in 10 new states. CLOV has yet to release a PR on this but it has been updated on the CMS website (see picture below). The stock price jumped with huge volume on this news but short sellers were able to manipulate it back down until the spike we just saw on Friday.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sc2w81eatzt61.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7eb791918794ff6a425e42fffa397e409788b782\n\nIt seems that Hindenbergs argument doesn\u2019t hold up as the same federal agency (CMS) they were using to support claims against Clover Health is currently supporting Clovers expansion into 10 new states. Which is huge news for CLOV by the way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Wrapping this up**\n\nNow say what you will about Chamath, but he had retail investors back during the GME squeeze. He promoted it, posted his personal positions, and while Wall Street, CNBC, and others attacked Gamestop, Chamath defended retail traders and the movement as a whole. It may be a total coincidence that his SPAC\u2019s were the target of short attacks shortly after, but his support of the GME squeeze may have made him a bigger target.\n\nAdditionally, we saw Hindenberg quickly come out Friday pushing back against the CLOV short squeeze premise. This could be out of the goodness of Nathan's heart, just wanting to spread the truth\u2026 OR it could be an indication that Hindenberg and/or the short sellers they work with behind the scenes are worried and stand to loose significant money if CLOV squeeze continues. This may be our best chance to fight back against the short selling market manipulation targeted against retail - an opportunity to make Hindenburg and the short selling hedge funds they work with the next Melvin Capital. Do we let that opportunity pass by?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo one knows what will happen in the market, I sure as hell don\u2019t, but given all that's been laid out here, I like the stock.\n\n$CLOV to $100",

        "selftext": "I am a simple man. I see a stock, I buy it. I've bought into some of the most valuable stocks in my time, and I've noticed I have a certain special ability that might be of use here at r/wallstreetbets. It doesn't matter what it is, or what it's actually worth, I can make any stock go down just by buying/showing interest in it.\n\nJust as a sample, here are all of the stocks I have currently been sequestering. You might find this explains the unusually bearish behavior you've been seeing in the market:\n\nVism: 1000 shares, cost .049, price is now .011\n\nHCMC: 20000 shares, cost .00269, price is now .0014\n\nGME: 60 shares, cost 207.49, price is now 159.00\n\nAMC: 100 shares, cost 11.93, price is now 9.23\n\nTAN: 8 shares, cost 103.61, price is now 82.29\n\nOGI: 325 shares, cost 2.90, price is now 2.34\n\nAPHA: 210 shares, cost 16.17, price is now 13.14\n\nOCGN: 10 shares, cost 6.47, price is now 5.38\n\nSNDL: 325 shares, cost .97, price is now .84\n\nACB: 25 shares, cost 7.83, price is now 7.66\n\nTSLA: 1 share, cost 723.12, price is now 712.39\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's not all! Some of the other bullish stocks I've managed to chop off at the knee are:\n\nPLTR , VOO, VT, SPY, SSY, TELL, UAVS, UBER, RKT, SDGR, QQQ, MSFT, AAPL, XRT, and YOLO. As a secondary power, I've noticed that each one has seen at least a little spike in price since my selling. It's only cheap for as long as I own it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I'd failed at an investment in just a few of these stocks, I'd call it a fluke, but my investment history has a loss rate sitting at somewhere around 95%. That's not chance, that's certainty. That's fate. I'd bet my life on those kinds of odds. That's not bad luck, that's a goddamn super-power.\n\nI understand that some of you may be skeptical, so I've decided to take this opportunity to run a real-life, superb experiment to see if I'm incompetent, or have reverse-control over reality. Recommend any stock of reasonable price, and I will buy in first thing tomorrow morning (I'll try to give y'all time to liquidate your own shares first, but sometimes just my intention to buy something will make the price start to plummet). If my powers are correct, we should see a massive dip in that stock within a week. After a week, I will sell, and the stock should return to normal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf this does turn out to be a predictable trend, I would be happy to render my services. The way I see it, here's the plan:\n\n1) Pick Stock\n\n2) Pick Entry Time\n\n3) I will buy a MASSIVE amount of stock 1 week prior. This guarantees a daily loss in value. The bear attack will likely lose 50% of its momentum each day, so a 5 day run will be most effective before value is dropping too slowly to be worth it.\n\n4) Everyone buys in at market open the following day. 1hr into market open, I will liquidate shares, ensuring a bull run so strong that each and every one of you will become a millionaire. This bull run lasts as long as the stock holds my attention, likely another 5 days.\n\n5) Each of you contributes 1% of your earnings to a kickstarter, which will then be used to rescue me from the excruciating losses I am bound to continue suffering.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know what you think, apes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr Pick a stock, I'll buy it and we'll see if it shits the bed within a week.",

        "selftext": "Posted by Nova &amp; Carob \n\nTo be clear from the inception of this DD, the purpose here is to shine a light on Hedge Funds and companies that are shorting AMC/GME and/or buying puts against AMC/GME. This light comes from a private community of Apes that have been looking very closely into the activities and inner workings of Citadel and friends. Our community intends to be as transparent as possible with everyape in our family, so we have made a unanimous decision to come forward here in this DD to all of you. We have coined the name The ApesOnWallStreet and before getting into the really good stuff we, Nova and Carob, want to personally provide some information about the Apes in our community. \n\nAnd a small message from Carob; I\u2019m good apes, thank you for your support, hope you enjoy reading our findings.\n\n**The ApesOnWallStreet** \n\n* We are a group of a few Apes that have been talking behind the scenes and merging the few wrinkles on our brains to form one very, very wrinkly Ape mind. The present goal is to create, review, and assist with DD\u2019s to help the Ape community grow in knowledge!\n* I personally am extremely grateful for this opportunity to be a voice against the players trying to manipulate the system. I speak for all of us when I say how grateful we are, to all of you who read our DD\u2019s and for all of your support. Every message, every upvote, every sentiment of encouragement expressed just reinforces our dedication to all of you and our drive to learn &amp; uncover more. \n\nI, Nova, The Student of Psychology, have nothing but the utmost love for every single ape, for all the huddled masses and for everyone struggling in this extremely complicated world of ours.\n\nWe were brought together by Moczak9, who read all of our DD\u2019s and reached out to all of us to bring us together in the belief that we could be a stronger force united. So far, I think he was right. I personally, am extremely grateful to him for this opportunity to be a powerful weapon against a very devious enemy. I personally never imagined that I would ever be part of something like this and now, honestly, I can\u2019t imagine a world without all of you. \n\n# Reddit Usernames ;\n\nu/TheNovaeterrae \n\nu/moczak9 (Founder) \n\nu/-Amewthyst- \n\nu/FuckYouWithAloha \n\nu/umu68 \n\nu/autistic-lord \n\nu/Horror_Carob2817 \n\nu/GGGGG\n\n**Now, let\u2019s get to the juicy part**. You all know I, Nova, love my links and this DD will be full of them. We will only include information that is readily accessible to everyape. No speculation. No opinions. I may include a small motivational speech because I have a need to add at least a dash of emotion into everything I do. It\u2019s my empathy that gives me my greatest strengths as a human being and I am so much less than I am, without that. But most of this will be facts. And links. And pictures. From the links. I hope this helps. \n\n# PART A. THE CONNECTION BETWEEN VIJAYABALAN MURUGESU OR (BALAN FOR THOSE WHO CAN\u2019T PRONOUNCE HIS NAME) AND CITADEL;\n\nNow, most of you might be wondering who is Balan? He isn\u2019t mentioned anywhere on any other DD or anything we\u2019ve seen that has to do with AMC, GME or Citadel. Well, hold onto your seats. \n\nThis is Balan. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rkar9fxiekt61.png?width=225&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77cbe0cd31beea4e14b20e00da9016ddb67e5670\n\nLink: Where we found his face. \n\n[https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2005/06/12/global-malaysians-network-spreading-afar](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2005/06/12/global-malaysians-network-spreading-afar)\n\nIf we start pulling the thread on Balan, you may first encounter Offshoreleaks. On offshore leaks you\u2019ll find 3 entities, all of which are named Redmile. I included a picture below. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rhz7tlyjekt61.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ed5b9e1afcbdd864c7c80a35c67cb621923edbc\n\nIf you then search for Redmile, you may encounter the following SEC Report. \n\n( Link: [https://sec.report/Document/0001472225-13-000001/](https://sec.report/Document/0001472225-13-000001/) )\n\nHere I want to show you the Form D/A Redmile Strategic Offshore Fund, Ltd D/A \\[Amend\\] - Notice of Exempt Offering of Securities. This was published January 25th, 2013 at 17:42:45. It was submitted on January 28th, 2013. The filing agent is RedMile Ventures, LTD. Now upon opening this SEC Report, the first message you will see is that \u201cThe Securities and Exchange Commission has not necessarily reviewed the information in this filing and has not determined if it is accurate and complete. The reader should not assume that the information is accurate and complete.\u201d \n\nMake of that what you will. \n\nThe jurisdiction here is the Cayman Islands. You\u2019ll see this location quite a few times as you look into Redmile. The reason being, is that the Cayman Islands are Balan\u2019s and Ken\u2019s wet dream palace. Gross, I know. And sorry, that is an opinion, someone might be into that, who knows? Anyway, the Cayman Islands is well known as one of the best tax havens of the world. According to Claire Boyte-White\u2019s article, titled \u201cWhy Are the Cayman Islands Considered a Tax Haven\u201d on Investopedia; \u201cUnlike most countries, the Caymans don\u2019t have a corporate tax which is a tax on the profits of a corporation\u201d. This makes it an incredible place for multinational corporations to base subsidiary entities which then act as shields to some or ALL of their incomes from taxation.

Balan and his HedgeFund friends;\n\nLet\u2019s face it, what would a world be for Balan if he only had one HedgeFund friend? That\u2019d probably be so empty, so lonely. That cannot be. Balan and Ken need friends. So we are going to dive into what Hedge Funds Balan is actually connected to, and it is a ton, probably even more than we were able to find. \n\n*Broad peak fund II LTD.;* \n\nA Singapore based company named Broad Peak Fund is connected to Balan, in the Caymans and others from there.

This company is based in several locations, the locations being; Singapore, Oregon and the Grand Cayman. A man named Syed Hyder Ahmad ( we will call him SHA for short ) is also connected to this company through the SingaPore based firm. Now you may ask who this is man? Well, this man is the founder of this company, Broad Peak Fund, but he founded it after he had resigned from his post from another well known company you might possibly recognize, ***Goldman Sachs***. He was the Co-Head of securities for Asia, after he resigned from his position he went on and started Broad Peak Investments, and of course, as we all could\u2019ve guessed, Goldman Sachs is also on the list of custodians. \n\n[https://www.globalcustodian.com/goldman-sachs-director-resigns-to-reportedly-start-his-own-asian-hedge-fund/](https://www.globalcustodian.com/goldman-sachs-director-resigns-to-reportedly-start-his-own-asian-hedge-fund/)\n\n*Pura Vida Investments LLC;*\n\nPura Vida being the name of the onshore company based in the US, they have an offshore fund that is called Pura Vida Offshore fund ONE, get it? The ONE because there are multiple -\\_-  Just like the other funds that Balan is connected to, this offshore fund is also based in the Caymans. The offshore funds are runned by; Ballan, Martin Laidlaw and Philip Hughes. We will call them the *Trio of Trouble* from now on. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll love that. \n\n1: [https://sec.report/CIK/0001637529](https://sec.report/CIK/0001637529) 2: [https://sec.report/CIK/0001774263](https://sec.report/CIK/0001774263) \n\n*140Summer partners LP;*\n\nAnd yet again another US based Hedge Fund that is associated with Balan! They own 3 onshore funds under the name 140 Summer Partners Onshore, 140 Summer Partners LP and 140 Summer Partners Fund GP LLC. For these 3 onshore funds they also own 2 offshore funds under the names; 140 Summer Partners Offshore LTD and Summer Partners Master fund. The Offshore funds have only posted a Securities offering once, now this isn\u2019t something to worry about since they have been in business for only a year. The company has a total of assets under management (AUM) of around $2.6 Billion in their first year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wlnbsy50fkt61.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=447ac94fe0ab60d1c520f7cea205c894e3d5ce3d\n\nYou see that perfectly normal rising line in every single chart? Yeah we do as well, this isn\u2019t normal stuff unless some bigger company decided to invest in them and gave them a boat load of money.\n\nConveniently enough they have sold the biggest amount of their assets through the fund in the Caymans. The onshore fund sold assets as well, but it was 30% less than what we are seeing in the Caymans.The only thing that the Fund in the Caymans has done is sell their securities, nothing else has been reported from there, *how convenient.*  [https://sec.report/CIK/0001813446](https://sec.report/CIK/0001813446) \n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9l0nmab1fkt61.png?width=422&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9b7245f0a82b5b02da9e1ac29021fe7a6a0101b\n\n*Pharo Trading Fund;*\n\nLast but not least for now is *Pharo trading fund*, this is a big company all around the world. So why did this spark our interest? It\u2019s not obviously not because Balan is on there because he obviously is. But the fact that the Pharo Trading Fund, LTD. based in the Caymans has only sold stock, for multiple years, I repeat, they have only sold stock but have never bought any ( At least not by filing them ). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/39hpkr72fkt61.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74c27defb5190296925c8e22476da57b4404e29c\n\nEvery single year they have offered securities/stock around the same time, the only year that stands out to us is the year of 2020 where they were 2 Months late when they previously never were. All of the directors got paid a nice bonus of $10k per person every single year for filing these reports.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9gv6w8l3fkt61.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b5dfc441a448cc53b30d981c4ca1374d04e6edc\n\nOur man Balan is on the board of directors for this company as well as; David Bree and Peter Rioda. Let\u2019s say that our man Balan has made a nice profit from only this company alone (around $100k), very lucrative business as you may see, and this is just one of the examples of many. \n\n[https://sec.report/Document/0001085146-19-001050/](https://sec.report/Document/0001085146-19-001050/) \n\n# Part C. THE ENEMY \n\nApes have really only been seriously fighting amongst each other on one thing. GME vs AMC. The great divide. The only thing that has seemingly separated apes is the fact that there are 2 stocks with incredible squeeze potential and because most of us are nerds, we believe that there can only be one. One stock to rule them all, one stock to find them, one stock to bring them all and...okay I\u2019ll stop, I\u2019ll stop\u2026\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b6h961z4fkt61.png?width=133&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfb3a9a75b2c9e05f620ed4efbab6ceb2507f058\n\nAND IN THE DARKNESS BIND THEM! I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t stop. You know that! You know that. But, I digress. Either way, you get it. Well, well, well, how we were all oh so wrong. Because the fact that there are 2 is exactly how we find the enemy. See the enemy of my enemy is my friend. And in this case, the enemy of AMC is also the enemy of GME. If you aren\u2019t following me here, I\u2019m saying that's the connection. These 2 stocks move together like a dance.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0vbrofu5fkt61.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b32ff1532c51491528cebd3aa128e3c3a6ebec1b\n\nSo stands to reason...that they share common enemies. Now, we\u2019re not going to completely release all their dirty secrets on this one DD but I have a feeling they\u2019re going to come across this. I just got a feeling. \n\nAnd I\u2019m curious how much of them are going to enjoy all the attention they have coming their way in future DD\u2019s. Here are a few of the names of companies that are interested in what AMC and GME are both doing as of late. \n\nMake of it what you will. \n\n[ADVISORNET FINANCIAL, INC](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/advisornet-financial-inc)**(PUT)** \n\n[SUSQUEHANNA INTERNATIONAL GROUP, LLP](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/susquehanna-international-group-llp)**(PUT) &amp; (CALL)**\n\n[**PRIVATE CAPITAL GROUP, LLC**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/private-capital-group-llc) **&amp;** [**PRIVATE ADVISOR GROUP, LLC**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/private-advisor-group-llc) **(PUT) &amp; (CALL)**\n\n[**FLAGSHIP PRIVATE WEALTH, LLC**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/flagship-private-wealth-llc)\n\n[**EVERENCE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT INC**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/menno-insurance-service-inc-dba-mma-capital-management)**(?)**\n\n[**DIMENSIONAL FUND ADVISORS LP**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/dimensional-fund-advisors-inc)**(?)**\n\n[**HUDSON BAY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT LP**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/hudson-bay-capital-management-l-p)**(?)**\n\n[**UBS ASSET MANAGEMENT AMERICAS INC**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/ubs-global-asset-management-americas-inc)**(?)**\n\n[**HSBC HOLDINGS PLC**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/hsbc-holdings-plc)**(?)**\n\n[**SCHRODER INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT GROUP**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/schroder-investment-management-group)**(?)**\n\n[**ALYESKA INVESTMENT GROUP, L.P.**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/alyeska-investment-group-l-p)**(?)**\n\n[**PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL GROUP INC**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/principal-financial-group-inc)\n\n[**SCULPTOR CAPITAL LP**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/oz-management-lp)**(PUT)&amp;(CALL)**\n\n[**JPMORGAN CHASE &amp; COMPANY**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/j-p-morgan-chase-co)**(D) ALL OF THE ABOVE**\n\n[**UBS OCONNOR LLC**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/ubs-oconnor-llc)**(PUT)**\n\n[**IMC-CHICAGO, LLC**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/imc-chicago-llc)**(PUT)&amp;(CALL)**\n\n[**CITADEL ADVISORS LLC**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/citadel-advisors-llc)**(D) ALL OF THE ABOVE**\n\n**(WILL ORGANIZE BETTER LATER WITH** **MUCH** **MORE DETAIL)**\n\nSo that\u2019s it. It\u2019s just these companies. Just 18. That seems like more than enough friends right? No. Not enough. So let\u2019s find more of Ken\u2019s friends, we want to really set up that playhouse. \n\n### Antara Capital LP ownership in CLVS / Clovis Oncology Inc\n\n2019-11-14 - Antara Capital LP has filed a 13F-HR form disclosing ownership of 0 shares of Clovis Oncology Inc (US:CLVS) with total holdings valued at $0 USD as of 2019-09-30. Antara Capital LP had filed a previous 13F-HR on 2019-08-14 disclosing 50,000 shares of Clovis Oncology Inc at a value of $743,000 USD. This represents a change in shares of -100.00 percent and a change in value of -100.00 percent during the quarter.\n\nAntara Capital LP has a history of taking positions in derivatives of the underlying security (CLVS) in the form of stock options. The firm currently holds 0 call options valued at $0 USD and 42,500 put options valued at $204,000 USD .\n\nOther investors with closed positions include [Canada Pension Plan Investment Board](https://fintel.io/so/us/clvs/canada-pension-plan-investment-board), [Soros Fund Management Llc](https://fintel.io/so/us/clvs/soros-fund-management-llc), [**Citadel Advisors Llc**](https://fintel.io/so/us/clvs/citadel-advisors-llc)**,** [**Invesco Ltd.**](https://fintel.io/so/us/clvs/invesco)**, and** [**Redmile Group, LLC**](https://fintel.io/so/us/clvs/redmile-group-llc)**.**\n\nA substantial portion of the Company\u2019s options, clearing and financing activities are with a **Bank of America Merrill Lynch subsidiary (\u201cBAML\u201d).** These positions are recorded at fair value under securities owned on the statement of financial condition. This results in a concentration of operational and credit risks with BAML. Such risk, however, is partially mitigated by the obligation of certain of these financial institutions to maintain minimum net capital and to segregate customers\u2019 funds and financial instruments from the financial institution\u2019s own holdings. \n\n**Merrill Lynch. That\u2019s it. Just Merrill Lynch.**  \n\n**And for the internet's sake, Wikipedia.** \n\n* [***The Quants: How a New Breed of Math Whizzes Conquered Wall Street and Nearly Destroyed It***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quants)\n* [***Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc. v.

But know that we fully intend to dive further, in multiple DD\u2019s with each one going really in depth into who runs these companies, how they run their companies, and just doing our part to make sure that everything is being done above board. Just, you know, to help out the SEC because they are just so busy these days, having to read and everything. Y\u2019know that\u2019s pretty new for them so we really just want to help out and we are very ready to take on these responsibilities. But, all jokes aside, does anyone reading this know what the best part of this is? \n\nWe don\u2019t even want a paycheck. We\u2019re not charging anyone, for any of this. Wouldn\u2019t take it. Because even though we live in a Capitalist Society that serves as a breeding ground for corruption, I personally, prefer to look at it as a test of human virtue. Will a person try to create something that helps humanity regardless of how much they make? Will a person deny a Million dollars so his employees can all get better pay? Will a person hoard all the money they can while others struggle? Will a person choose the easy way to live, or the hard way? The moral way. In service of others. I personally think corruption has an expiration date. Maybe. I sure hope so. \n\nAlright, speech over. More links below. Links on links on links. And pictures. These links include compelling information about what has been said in this DD and maybe a bit more. Sorry Andrew, but we think these links speak very loudly enough for themselves. Thank you all for taking the time to read this. I hope you have a new wrinkle now. \n\n**--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**\n\n**https://fintel.io/so/us/clvs/antara-capital**\n\n**https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-03/citadel-hires-apollo-s-head-of-corporate-credit-trading-barratt**\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1146184/000114618420000006/CDRG\\_StmtFinCndtn2019.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1146184/000114618420000006/CDRG_StmtFinCndtn2019.pdf)\n\n**--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**\n\n# JPMorgan Sells $13 Billion of Bonds in Largest Bank Deal Ever \n\n# --&gt; [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jpmorgan-sell-13-billion-bonds-184602000.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jpmorgan-sell-13-billion-bonds-184602000.html)\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Cayman Law Bars Suit Over $1B Fund, NY Appeals Court Says\n\nMay 29, 2013 by [owbewcirk](https://www.ieyenews.com/author/owbewcirk/) \n\n[https://www.ieyenews.com/cayman-law-bars-suit-over-1b-fund-ny-appeals-court-says/](https://www.ieyenews.com/cayman-law-bars-suit-over-1b-fund-ny-appeals-court-says/)\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z6w78n97fkt61.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=910f6096e29b1c2ba7f1e942adb56d73d30d6bbe\n\nIf everything stays the same, rest assured the next web will also be more vast and a bit more detailed.

Honest workers, Citadel doesn\u2019t care;\n\nSo you are an ape that has worked their entire life from 9 to 5, you have earned some good pension by now right? Well you do, but Citadel and other funds DO NOT care about that, by investing with brokers from the Caymans they don\u2019t have the protection that they do in the US. They do not care about losing retirement money, as long as it is in their best interest. They invest in risky businesses without having a good broker that has the same regulators as in the US.\n\nWe are talking about millions of dollars they are stealing from the pension funds, and no they do not care about this at all. Firefighters, hospital workers, teachers, they\u2019re basically scamming every single one of them for their own gains. They set these Shell funds up to protect themselves and nothing else. They care about 1 single person in the world and that is themself. So what is our duty now? Go out and show that this behaviour is no longer accepted, show them who's boss and that is US APES.[http://pensionpulse.blogspot.com/2017/11/the-grand-cayman-pension-scam.html](http://pensionpulse.blogspot.com/2017/11/the-grand-cayman-pension-scam.html) \n\nWe hope you all have enjoyed reading our research and this is only the surface that we\u2019re scraping right here. We are coming out with way more in the future, we love all of you guys. All of our PM\u2019s are always open if you have any questions regarding the stocks. Except for Amewthyst.

        "selftext": "Hola!   NrdRage here.  My apologies  for not posting this yesterday, but  Reddit, with their extreme ethics  (?) put me in a corner for 3 days for  upvoting a couple of comments my  daughter made about motorcycle  safety.  Good to see their priorities are  in order, An upvote from the  same NAT, that's way more important than  employment background checks  on pedophile enablers, right Reddit?\n\nGiven   that last week's DD was my first complete WHIFF (seriously,   embarrassingly bad, but we'll get into that), I'm going to work hard to   find a layup for everybody next week.  Think I've found one, but with   that tax bomb President Harris tossed out yesterday, I don't want to   name a new ticker, even if I think it's all smoke (because the mere act   of sabre rattling can shake a market, and there's sure to be plenty  more  of that in the coming weeks as the administration attempts to  normalize  the plan to create the actual highest cap gains tax rate in  the world).   So instead, let's go back through the DD's (the ones I  haven't deleted  because they were no longer effective, at any rate) and  update them and  where I am with them.  This should hopefully, for at  least a day, stop  people from grabbing a DD from 2 months ago and  jumping in then  wondering why the trade is different.  Oh, who am I  kidding, I know you  fucks, nothing will stop that.  At the very least,  it should shut up the  small group of people who played the trades wrong  and declared them  broken.  Let's start from February, so right after  the first round of  people who \"liked the stock\"\n\n# DD #1:  $PLTR.  Original Date January 27th, 2021\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[I tried to tell you retards](https://preview.redd.it/pqrvl3j266v61.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b59d3513e9581b0babd63301fc9dd1cb8482387)\n\n**URL:**    Ended up deleting it - not because the DD was wrong, but because the   Palantards got it to about -700 karma and I decided to let them get   crushed.\n\n**Original thesis:**    $PLTR (then $35) was wildly overpriced based not only on their market   cap as a company who's almost every dollar is already priced in as a   result of their reliance upon government contracts, which span years,   their reliance upon the courts to force those contracts to be extended,   but also because the company insiders were selling stock like mad,   George Soros had signaled he was going to sell the 4% of the float he   controlled for \"ethical reasons\" (hah!).  Oh, and because Peter Thiel   participates in the wrong type of political ideology amongst the tech   elite, that he was so unfavored that there would be active attempts to   harm his ventures.\n\n**Original price target:**    I stated the company was worth no more than $22 and that people  should  open $25 puts expiring in late March.  In later comment updates,  I  stated that one should buy puts any time the company strongly  eclipsed  25, and should buy calls any time the company sinks to around  22, as  that's its rangebound territory.\n\n**How did it work/what has changed:**   Not a single thing.  It was literally impossible to screw this trade  up  unless you went against it.  So, of course, most of this sub did  just  that and lost money.\n\n**What the smart play is on it today:**   I no longer buy puts in $PLTR, but any time I see it creep to 22, I  buy  a biweekly $22 call.  Easy money that I will then put on the end of  a  fishing pole and hold over the head of a Palantard.\n\n**Trade rating:**  10/10.  15 bagger (and counting), plus you got to point and laugh at half of this sub.\n\n# DD #2:  Weed Stonks.  Original date February 3rd, 2021 (a non-Friday DD)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rsk2tbc566v61.jpg?width=300&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf756ce0a9fad711fd9fce0af241b7768ec065c3\n\nURL:  [Right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lh6ttf/pass_the_bong_and_gather_round_bros_were_gonna/)\n\n**Original thesis:**     You're the bad kind of retarded if you were throwing money into  SNDL.   If you wanted a \"cheap\" stock, you should go with one that  doesn't put  fucking rubber and plastic in their weed - so to buy a  stock like  Organigram instead if you could remember their stupid  fucking name.   $APHA and $TLRY should be joined at the hip and either  APHA must come up  or TLRY must come down.  Talked about $CGC and $ACB,  though didn't  endorse them.  Matter of fact, I didn't really endorse  any of them.   This DD was more about \"well, I can't tell you not to do  this stupid  thing, but if you're going to do it, at least make less bad  choices  amongst the stupid ones\".  Way to make me feel like a pearl  clutching  Boomer parent, assholes.\n\n**Original Price Target:**    I didn't give any, because it was all obviously a bubble and I was   mostly advising people to be careful with the play, but to pick better   companies if you were going to jump in on it.\n\n**How did it work out/what has changed:**    If you read between the lines and TRADED (read:  Scalped like Crazy   Horse) these stocks instead of invested in them, you probably fared   pretty well.  All the weed stocks peaked a week later and then started   their decline (except for $APHA, which continued to rise for a while   before collapsing as it tried to find equilibrium w/ $TLRY).  My own   results were originally mixed on this.  I made a lot of money scalping   Sundial before getting out of the way at the top and laughed as it   collapsed to the surprise of a million braindead stoners.  I made some   pretty decent money on TLRY, made quite a lot on APHA (and then gave it   all back and then some on a stupid play for the merger that expires on   the 30th, a nice 7 figure waste of money), and made some money on   Organigram, but I kept the 1/22 $5c's and am reasonably certain they're a   complete loss, but just like bagging Olivia Munn, there's always a   chance.\n\n**What the smart play is on it today:**    Don't touch any of them.  The reality is, long term, these Canadian   companies are going to have a hard time penetrating the US market, even   if the product is federally legalized.  But, more importantly, the one   thing every weed company has in common with one another is that they  are  absolutely TERRIBLE at execution.  This is why you don't make  stoners  CEO's of publicly traded companies just because they're  passionate about  the product.  They've got the easiest product out  there to sell, and no  matter how low you set the bar, they somehow find  a way to trip over  it.\n\n**What you should play instead if you want to get in this space:**     $MO.  Yeah, you heard me, $MO.  Think about this a moment:  These   guys sell tobacco.  A product that they are forbidden from marketing or   even talking about, which gets hidden away behind cages in stores,  which  has been completely wiped from movies that might product place or  even  being MENTIONED in public because of regulations.  A product  which in  some places it's illegal to use in your own home or alone in  your  vehicle as you take a 10 minute break from your soul-sucking job  and  question every choice you've made in life, just hoping to get 5  minutes  of sweet relief before you have to head back behind the Wendy's  to  finish your shift....and they STILL sell billions of dollars a  year.   Say what you will about their product, but these fuckers **know how to execute.**    And they're already in America.  You don't think that they won't be  at  the front of the pack when that shit gets legalized?  You don't  think  they won't give up the brown leaf for the green leaf?  You don't  think  they won't start buying up every Ganja Goddess or Chronic ReLEAF  store  they can find once they're allowed to?  Fuck outta here.\n\n**Trade rating:**    8/10:  You made money if you followed it and got out a week later,  you  made even more if you caught how lukewarm I was on the entire  sector  and picked something else, and you saved a lot if you got out of  Sundial  like I said, but the weed play really died out a very short  time later,  so the upside was very limited.\n\n# DD #3:  $BB.  Original Date February 12th, 2021\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nURL:  [Right here, bitch-o](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liezfr/nrdrages_friday_dd_theres_still_one_meme_stock/)\n\n**Original Thesis:**    Using another company that pivoted from enterprise applications to   automotive ($NUAN) and has no competition, extrapolated long term   earnings potential of a company pivoting from phones to secure   automotive and fleet management.\n\n**Original Price Target:**    87.50.....in 2023.  My positions were very early, so my average PPS  is  7.67 and my calls are 5's, so not really playing the same game.  I  have  since added, over time, a load of 1/23 42c's at an average cost of  like  80 cents.\n\n**How did it work out:**    Thesis still holds, though it would sure be nice if the green number   reflected a mammoth spike in equity price.  The only reason this  company  isn't sitting at 20 right now and well on its way to smart  vehicle  dominance is because of the damned chip shortage.\n\n**What the smart play is on it today:**    It's still buy and tuck away in a hole somewhere like a Boomer.  Grab   the farthest out, farthest OTM calls you can find (they should be no   more than 50 or 60 cents).   You'll still be a massive disappointment to   your parents, but maybe you'll be able to trick them that you're   starting to grow up enough to where they'll let you move out of your   refrigerator box and housesit for them when they go on a cruise.  Hey,   speaking of....\n\n**Trade rating:**    5/10:  I expect this one to age like wine and ultimately be a huge   profit maker, but the chip shortage was a resistance point I failed to   consider so it hasn't seen the immediate burst.\n\n# DD #4:  Cruise lines.  Original Date February 19th, 2021\ud83d\udcf7\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Not mine.  But I wants it.](https://preview.redd.it/onkncs8c66v61.jpg?width=275&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b139c61852f25bfc1b0a4d831afc7aa42eebf86d)\n\n**URL:**  [For you poor bastards who missed this boat](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnpqrp/nrdrages_friday_dd_the_bermuda_triangle_and_you/)\n\n**Original Thesis:**   The cruise liners were one of the last Wuhan-fucked plays   out       there     who hadn't taken a true turn at the recovery wheel   just   yet.      Which   made   them smooth sailing for easy tendies\n\n**Original Price Target January 2022:**  $NCLH 46, $CCL/$CUK 47/42 respectively, $RCL $90.  My     positions      were    established a month and a half before the DD, so     my cost   basis    was    different.  I was holding 700 1/22 25c's in   $CCL and   2000 1/23    $42.5c's    in $NCLH.\n\n**How did it work out:**    If you jumped in shortly thereafter and played the stocks      right,     you    made enough to buy your own boat.  Sure, maybe it  was  a    17'     Bayliner    that all the women at the marina called    \"adorable\"   and  were    clearly    conflating towards what they    assumed was your    pathetic 2.5\"    penis size    at diamond hardness,    but it floated, it    had an engine,   and  dammit, it    was yours  and   you had enough left    over for a   captain's  hat and a bunch     of   beer money.  This one  was   hard to screw   up -  especially since  it    was   the first one I   started  providing   updates on  and made  sure    everybody   knew to take   profits  at 32 on   NCLH and buy   back at  29  (and  to continue     playing that  range), etc.    People  in  these   from the date  of posting   who   didn't  just buy and    hold likely    have turned at least a 6    bagger by now.     This trade  was,   and to   some  extent is, still solid    gold.\n\n**What's happened since then:**              In spite of none of the companies in question needing to    issue        shares   as they had enough cash on hand, $RCL issued    shortly  after    that    DD,  $CCL  immediately copied them, and $NCLH    followed  suit a    couple   of  weeks   after $CCL.  At least none of    them tried  to pull  an   $AMC  and   have the   CEO go on TV and  give   zero credit  to retail    investors  for   saving the   company  and   instead taking  all the  credit   before  diluting   and then    paying   himself a fat ass  bonus  for doing   nothing  but issuing    shares like     some sort of  conquering  hero.  The   amount of  the  dilution   in   question   meant  that the  resistance  price  of (to  use  as example,     $NCLH) of $32 a    share  already  represented a   higher  price than   the   pre-virus share   price.    Ditto  for the  other  2.   Investors   haven't seem   to have  noticed,    however,   and these  stocks  still   trade in the  general   range,  though the     resistance  level is now    more like 31/25/85.    Also,  the  sailing    schedules  for  the   domestic  cruise ships has  been  pushed   back  as a   result of     somebody high up at  the CDC  obviously  shorting    these  stocks,  as    that's  the only  explanation  for why they're   so   focused  on trying   to   send these  companies to 0   by  preventing   sailings.    Norwegian  is  resuming  cruises  outside  the  US in the next   couple  of   months.\n\n**What the smart play is today:**              These 3 companies are no longer as attractive as a result  of     the        dilution, but they're still good swing traders within   their       respective     channels.  I'd put up a picture of some   charts to  show      those, but I     already told you where the   resistance is,  grow a      wrinkle and learn  where    support is.\n\nI          have since   exited  my positions in $CCL (and was never in    $RCL),     and   have   drastically  reduced my holdings in $NCLH, but I    do  still     maintain a    skeleton crew  of January calls for them.\n\n**Trade rating:**              9/10.  It was really hard to fuck this one up, unless you    just        didn't   believe me. And it's still a live trade.  The only    thing  I       could have   done better was post it sooner, but I  make   sure my    trades     are   established and going the right way  before I   talk  about   them in     depth.\n\n# DD #5:  The Semiconductors:  Original Date February 26th, 2021\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[And before you ask, yes it is.  Took this the other day when I   decided    to    start working on this. In retrospect, should have   washed first.](https://preview.redd.it/y6vlid9g66v61.jpg?width=1530&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6bfae5eeadc261cda360675c53f44c33d6ca1582)\n\n**URL:** [For you poor, broke ass souls who missed it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lt89s3/nrdrages_friday_dd_the_semis_play_not_just_the/)\n\n**Original Thesis:**          While everybody was spooging over high end chipmakers like  Theta        Semiconductor, $AMD, and $NVDA (and, to be fair, I had been   telling       people to buy $NVDA 545/580c's, which were all   multibaggers), the   real     action was in the commodity level   chipmaker space,  specifically    American   companies (or companies   that could masquerade  as them) who    would line   up to the trough to   get some free  government money to go    from being   nofab to fab   companies.\n\n**Original Price Target:**          $NXPI 200-210 within 3 months; $ON to within 43 within 3  months,       $MRVL  to 75 within that same range.  And I didn't give a  price   target     for  $UTZ, just that it would go up.\n\n**How did it work out:**          LAMBOS for almost everyone!  Supposing you could order one,   given      that  they can't get the chips they need to build the cars.       $NXPI   got   to  214 before pulling back to 202.  $ON hit 43 2  weeks   before I     predicted  it would.  $MRVL failed to live up to    expectations and has     been  essentially dead money since that    posting, but if you'll  recall I    was  very explicit that I was    bullish on them ONLY as a 5G  play,   whereas  the  others I felt had    more range and scope.  So  short-term   $MRVL play  was a  loser if you    moved up the timeline I  liked.  Oh, and   $UTZ printed  for   everybody   that just bought in  because they liked the   product.  It   was a   nice  little pocket play.\n\n**What's happened since then:**          The trade ran its course to perfection.  As I've been saying  for  a       little while now, semis, with the exception of $NVDA, are  not     presently    an interesting trade because there's been a  rotation out  of    them  after   this period of growth.  I am still  incredibly  bullish  on   the  sector as a   whole, but they need a  breather and  some time  out  of  the  sun before   continuing a leg up.   They're not  even good   rangebound   trades right now.    And LOL @  any of you  clowns who bought   $TSM  anyways  because Cramer  and his  cult of  Shortbus All-Stars   told  you  they were  the best in breed.   Suckers.    In the case of  $MRVL,  they  acquired  another company and  now are  going  to  \"officially\"  become a US  company  instead of that  tax  dodging shit   they've been  pulling, which  means the  thesis  about  them lining up for   gubmint  money is sound and  will happen   down the  road.\n\n**What the smart play is today:**         Ignore semis till at least June; probably July.  I have exited   out    of   all of my positions and have taken immense profits from the      commodity   semis.  I similarly got rid of my $NVDA calls at the  top,     though I am   willing to find a re-entry point in the 575 range  if  it    happens.  Don't   be sad that the trade is over, be glad that  it     happened and you might   have been there.  Or at least be happy  that I     was there and am   appreciative that I got to stack a bunch  more  paper    I'll never spend.    Either way.\n\n**Trade rating:**  9/10.  Absolutely perfect call, with only $MRVL being the laggard, but it came with the appropriate warning.\n\n# DD #6:  $CLNE.  Original Date March 5th, 2021\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v4er1pwi66v61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a69c73b90b3d059645e2d9f3f61af090f7c8921\n\n**URL:** [Got buried in a mountain of Gibbons doing dumbass \"DD\" on their stonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lye7st/nrdrages_friday_dd_ok_one_of_you_apes_needs_to/)\n\n**Original Thesis:**         People are finally willing to take greenhouse gas emission   capture      seriously, and the infrastructure and transport sector is   finally   ready    to start moving away from diesel and traditional oil   based   products  in   favor of carbon negative renewable natural gas -     especially  companies   making carbon pledges or located in states   where   progressive  leadership   is going to demand emission reduction.     $CLNE  was uniquely  positioned  as  the nation's leading provider  of   that  fuel source and,  unlike all  the  other green energy   EV/charging   companies out there,  actually has a  real  product that   they sell in   large quantities, making  it a diamond in  the  otherwise   pipe dream   green energy space.\n\n**Original Price Target:**  $17 by late May, $31 by next March\n\n**How did it work out:**         I said to buy it as soon as it got under 11.  It got under 11  the      very  next trading day.  Then immediately shot up almost 50%  within   10    days  and was one of the few stocks out there  consistently   finishing    green  while the entire market was tanking.   As long as you   played it    smart and  heeded warnings about stonks  not always just   going up and    taking profit  after parabolic rises  and looking for   re-entries later,    then you made  enough money to  put RNG high powered   engines in both  your   boat from  cruise stocks  and your Lambo from   semis and convert  your   entire house to  being  powered by cow farts   before the green  energy   sector got   skullfucked.  If you held, you'll   feel this trade  didn't   work out   (though it still will, if you   picked the June target  date like   I  said)  and, if you re-entered   after taking profits, you've  either    been  averaging down lately as   this has been getting unfairly  dragged    down  with the entire green   energy sector or else you're   underwater on    it....but you'll still be   fine.\n\n**What's happened since then:**         A LOT.  From them getting dragged down from the mid 15's all the     way    to below 10 on nothing but good news to them signing major      partnerships   with $BP, Total and Citgo, to signing a half a billion      dollar deal  with  $AMZN to power their long-haul fleet with RNG to      Washington DC  flat-out  stating that methane capture is a capstone  of     their green  energy plan,  there has been nothing but good news  coming     out of this  company.  And  yet It got absolutely PUMMELED  with the     sector for the  last month, and  then this past week  started Monday     morning up 27% only  to not only give  all of those  gains back but  lose    another 20% by the  close of trading  Tuesday  because of a  combination    of market  manipulation by a hedge fund   that shorted the  stock into    oblivion for a  hit and run (do a search  on my profile by  posts and  look   up my Wednesday discussion if you  want to be  absolutely fucking    infuriated that someone borderline  committed a  crime) coupled with them    paying off an analyst at RayJay  to run a hit  piece on the $AMZN deal  to   try and sink  the stock  price even lower,  right down to that hedge   fund  suppressing  the  price of the stock  for 2 weeks to keep it under   $12 so  the most   popular options for  April would expire worthless.    This  company has,  in  short, been  subjected to a biblical level of   fuckery  that was  probably  was some  Mortimer Brothers bullshit for a $1   bet, and  it's  still  standing and  ready to spring. Oh, and somebody   informed  me  that they  got some  airtime on Cramer's show on the 24th.    Jimmy  Retard  is luekwarm on   them, and you should always inverse him,   so  balls to the  wall, baby.    Especially since he tried to compare the    2009 version of  this  company  (when nobody gave 2 shits about nat   gas)  with the 2021   version (where  governments are going to force   people  into this type  of  product and the  transport industry is   finally  transitioning away  from  oil).\n\n**What   the smart play  is today:**    My thesis, as written back then, is  EXACTLY  what I would  write even   today.  I stand by every last thing  in there,  including  the strike date   and price, in spite of the hedge  fund  bullshit that  artificially tanked the stock for no reason other  than  unmitigated  greed.  It was my   favorite stock in the whole  market then,  and it  still is now, just   balanced against the  knowledge that, as a  very  small midcap bordering on   a small cap,  it's easy to push around  and  very clearly fucked some hedge fund  manager's wife or something. If  you  don't believe me, every   analyst  out there says this company is  worth  double what it's at now. My  original position still exists, except now  it's bigger and I'm also the  owner of a lot (and I mean a LOT) of shares  on top of it that I was  gobbling up like a porn star eating all the  money shots in an episode  of Blacked on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\n**Trade rating:**    10/10.   Nobody was talking about it before that DD.  You made a   multi-bagger in  just a few days if you jumped in, and even though   you're battered and  bloody right now on the 2nd run with them because   of the manipulation  from a hedge, you're still going to make mad   tendies with this one.   They've got EVERYTHING going for them,   corporate America is looking to  them for the carbon negative fuel as an   easy way to lower their  footprints, no competition other than a  shitty  (4 letter word for non IPO company) building their first   capture plant  who has NO fueling depots or infrastructure, politicians   demanding  carbon neutral fuel and, unlike most of the sector they  reside  in,  actually have a product and make money.\n\n# DD #7:  $BE.

Oh, and  politicians finally  acknowledging that  our utility grid is well beyond  end of life and hot  garbage and not  wanting voters blaming them for  citizen deaths being  willing to spend  taxpayer money to address that.\n\n**Original Price Target:**  70% conviction of a $32 price by mid-April, 45-50 by August, and a long term target of $72\n\n**How did it work out:**    I  had the unfortunate pleasure of posting this DD right as the  entire   green energy space was being crushed by big money rotating into   \"value\"  and later into \"the 10 biggest companies in the S&amp;P to  make  SPY go  up\", so things haven't gone as planned to this point.  The   stock has  actually fallen from the 27's all the way down into the  22's,  though it  has rebounded this week and looks to be starting a  fresh  run.  It's a  bit of a hail Mary, but that 5/21 32c that I was  hyping  back then....it  might still print.  Though even I rolled over  my May  calls to August at  the same strike to buy more time to make up  for them  getting dragged  down with a bunch of companies that aren't  even in the  same space as  these dudes.\n\n**What happened since then:**     They haven't announced any big deals, but I know they're working on    some.  And they set up a new global office in Dubai to start marketing    their products worldwide, which should only give them tailwinds going    forward.\n\n**What the smart play is today:**     I still stand behind everything written in that DD, with the only    thing I'd like to change is the expiry date on the calls from May to    August.  And again, if you're sitting on May calls that are way, WAY    down....I wouldn't cut bait with them just yet just because they're    already almost worthless and there's still a puncher's chance they fight    back.  This thing has started to get some life, and I wouldn't bet    against it being able to hit that strike in a month - well, I wouldn't    bet a lot.  I would just feel better if it were 4.  Long term, this is    still going to be a great investment.\n\n**Trade rating:**    I was  going to give this one a 2/10 just because it had been going   almost  straight down for weeks now killing the May expirys, but the   longer  calls and shares are still very much alive, but I'm going to   upgrade it  to a 3.5 because it's made some good movement, and I will   cross my  fingers that, by this time next month, I'll call it a 6.\n\n# DD #8:  $RYCEY.

The stock hasn't really moved    since that DD, and should still be tucked away.  The condition for   their  recovery (increased air travel) has not yet happened, therefore,   it's  not their turn yet.\n\n**What happened since then:**     People have continued to be afraid of their own shadows.  Especially    the Europoors, even though England no longer even has enough cases to    qualify as being in a pandemic.  Dumbasses.\n\n**What the smart play is today:**  Same as it was then.  Buy shares.  Hold.  My positions haven't changed.\n\n**Trade rating:**  4/10.  Their turn for recovery is taking forever, but it'll get there.\n\n# DD #9:  $NVTA.

Transformational technology, market leader.  Also, gave me an   opportunity to collaborate with Cathie about the stock (though, because   of my, to be charitable \"un-PC\" vernacular, she declined to put her  name  on the DD).\n\n**Original Price Target:**  50 by mid June, 60's by 2021\n\n**How did it work out:**    We're now officially in the space where the long-game trades are  still  developing and can't yet be judged.  The stock, typical of every   biotech, has been very choppy in this uncertain market.  It opened up   big a couple of days after the DD, but has drifted downwards since that   point.  The volatility still makes it a great intraday scalper, and the   thesis is still sound.\n\n**What happened since then:**   The rotation away from high multiple high growth stocks has continued,  especially after President Harris  proposed increasing the cap gains  tax to the highest in the world (via her J. Dunham \"Walter\" puppet).\n\n**What the smart play is today:**    I stand behind the DD and thesis, and the entry points are still   attractive.  I would move the strike price down into the low-mid 40's,   however.  My position has not changed.\n\n**Trade Rating:**  Incomplete.  Still developing.  I was very clear this one was not for the faint of heart.\n\n# DD #10:  $NEE.  Original Date April 9th, 2021\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5dl8kuuq66v61.jpg?width=1033&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56ad32cd35498f28f7998cdca7e268907f7c3175\n\n**URL:** [You're late, but here you go](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mnksim/nrdrages_friday_dd_ill_take_a_mackinnon_jersey_2/)\n\n**The thesis:**    The $ICLN ETF, which was mostly just $PLUG, was rebalancing in a big   way; Blackrock would thus be purchasing massive quantities of shares of   stock in the new companies.  $NEE was uniquely positioned because it  had  the stability and rotation safety of a value stock, but the  multiple of  a growth stock\n\n**Price targets:**  I said definitely take profits at 83, and my positions were June 75's and 77.50's.\n\n**How did it work out:**    Flawlessly.  The stock basically rocketed to $80 as Blackrock   purchased shares much more aggressively than anticipated, and anyone who   played this trade with me and watched volume would have noticed the   volume fell off a cliff and took profits before it started creeping back   down (as everybody else was taking profits, too).  I exited my   positions near the top and stacked all the money in an air conditioned,   humidity controlled room that consumes immense amounts of coal power.\n\n**What happened since then:**    The share price has started to pull back, which was expected.    Further, they had an earnings call, and you should almost never play   earnings in this environment.\n\n**What the smart play is today:**    This trade is effectively finished - it was predicated upon a   rebalance, the rebalance happened, it was a lot of fun, we all made lots   of money.  This is still a really well run company but the short-term   thesis is no longer valid.  The DD will stay up only as a display of  the  company's operations, margins, and overall growth potential if you  want  to act like a Boomer and be a long-term investor.  I pulled out  all of  my short-term positions, and only maintain shares at this stage.\n\n**Trade rating:**    10/10.  Took even less time than expected for the trade to complete,   and was never in any danger of doing anything but printing tendies.  No   matter when you bought leading up to the rebalance, your position was   green and stayed that way the whole time.\n\n# DD #11:  $ISRG.  Original Date April 16th, 2021:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ms2pwzhs66v61.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48d5a30b34e00bb9b21c4571cbc053739206ce54\n\n**URL:** [Thus proving I'm not the Zombie Jew](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ms51jy/nrdrages_friday_dd_a_robot_may_not_injure_a_human/)\n\n**The thesis:**    A pure earnings play that I didn't really want to write, but my 1st   idea ($PLUG puts) ran its course before Friday.  Analysts had been   lowering expectations for $ISRG for weeks, and even management was   saying things to make it seem like they were going to have a subpar   quarter.  Which made sense, given that a lot of operating theatres are   still closed.\n\n**Price Targets:**    As it was an earnings play, didn't list any long term, but suggested   going long in a company that typically only melts upwards when the  stock  fell by 60 or 70 bucks.\n\n**How did it work out:**    Not even slightly.  At all.  Absolutely TERRIBLE call.  They blew the   doors off earnings, beating by more than a dollar those lowered  analyst  expectations.  Sales were up.  Procedures were up.  Everything  was up.   Instead of going down 10% on weakened guidance, the stock shot  up 5% and  blasted through all-time-highs.  This was a big time loser  of a trade.\n\n**So why did it happen:**   I can't take credit for digging this up, that credit goes to /u/Farmer_eh who did  all the sleuthing of HOW they pulled it off.  It turns out  $ISRG  accelerated depreciation on a lot of their production equipment,  and  also had an increase in inventory.  This means that they had a bunch  of  extra Da Vincis laying around in a warehouse and were selling them  to  medical centers at a steep discount, which is why they sold so many   more robots than any analyst expected (30% more than pre-COVID sales),   and also lowered their expenses for the quarter.  These are neat tricks   that a company can only pull every so often, and it was smart of $ISRG   to not only have that one in their pocket for a rainy day, but also the   wherewithall to play the card at the best possible moment.  So, in a   way, the thesis itself was sound and the quarter would, in fact, have   been a down one had they just been organic about it all, but I failed to   account for easily accomplished accounting magic and motivated sale   pricing to ensure a quarterly beat.  Which is something I'll remember   next time I think about shorting a company that beats on quarterlies   almost 90% of  the time.\n\n**What the smart play is today:**    The original DD talked about letting the stock price come down and   then going long, because this is a company that is mostly always going   to go up.  However, it's run up so fast after those earnings that even   long is a dicey play now, so this is a company that, if you aren't   already in, you should probably stay away from.  However, buried in that   DD was commentary about how $PLUG had been beaten down to the level I   wanted to see it go to already, and that it was time to go long in  them.   I've had a couple of you message me, showing that you had read  between  the lines,  to say you covered your puts after that and went  into  calls.  So those are paying off.  As the green energy sector is  starting  to rebound a bit, $PLUG will naturally get caught up in that,  so  there's a play there.\n\n**Trade rating:**    1/10.  It was going to be a 0, but, as mentioned above, if you had   read between the lines there, there was a secondary play buried in there   about $PLUG calls, so I'll give 1 single, solitary point on this   otherwise complete dumpster fire of a call.\n\nAll my love\n\n\\-Chad Dickens",

        "selftext": "By now you have likely seen some $ASO talk. There are some other really good DD posts in WSB that cover different aspects of the stock. This post will break down why I'm bullish AF on ASO and why I believe that it could hit $60 or higher in the next few weeks. Before GME gang jumps down my throat, don't worry, I am still hodling. There are other stocks to make money on while that one consolidates and trades sideways for a little while. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR**: ASO looks a lot like RKT did in February when there was a massive spike. Short interest is high (may be over 45%) on a stock that has been steadily rising since its IPO in late 2020. They beat earnings expectations in a similar fashion to RKT (1.09 actual vs. 0.62 expected EPS = 76% beat). Undervalued stock that is primed for a squeeze means bears r fuk. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n  \nOk, for those of you apes with a few wrinkles, I will explain why you might be able to take your wife and her boyfriend and her parents to Red Lobster and order more than water and biscuits. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \n**2021 is the year of the squeezes and the SI% on this bad boy is HIGH**\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \nHedgies have shorted a wide swath of the market, with a focus on retailers. Makes sense, right? The pandemic has hit a lot of retailers hard, forcing a lot of store closures. Academy Sports &amp; Outdoors has been able to thrive through the pandemic for a few reasons: \n \n1. Their stores are mainly located in southern states whose COVID restrictions are far more lax than their northern counterparts. \n  \n2. Guns and ammo. There has been a massive pullback on offering guns and ammo by big box retailers due to a shift in public sentiment due to mass shootings. However, thanks to the pandemic and civil unrest, more people are buying guns than ever. ASO has not curtailed their gun and ammo offerings, which are a recession-proof sales channel right next to liquor.  \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \nRetailers have been shorted massively (see GME) with the shorts expecting that retail will die with the rise of online sales. Maybe they are right in the long term, but for now, people are still going to stores. Here in GA, you wouldn't know there is a pandemic if people weren't wearing masks. The mall parking lots are full. The short interest on ASO was 45.21% on 3/15 according to TD Ameritrade (compare that to 36.6% on RKT in late February). The stock is up 147% since its IPO in October 2020 without any significant dips, which tells us one thing: none of the shorts are in the money.  I first took interest in ASO about a month ago when I saw them at the top of the shorted list. Investing in stocks in January that had high short interest was quite lucrative for me, so I've been trying to continue investing in shorted stocks that appear to have a bright future. Because bears r fuk and squeezes are fun. \n   \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLet's look at the short interest over time for ASO: \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n|Report Date|Total Shares Sold Short|Dollar Volume Sold Short|Change from Previous Report|Percentage of Float Shorted|Days to Cover|Price on Report Date|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|3/15/2021|12,510,000 shares|$308.37 million|+0.8%|39.4%|9.1|$24.65|\n|2/26/2021|12,410,000 shares|$305.04 million|-3.0%|39.1%|8.3|$24.58|\n|2/12/2021|12,790,000 shares|$306.45 million|+24.5%|41.2%|8.9|$23.96|\n|1/29/2021|10,270,000 shares|$262.50 million|+10.1%|33.1%|7.3|$25.56|\n|1/15/2021|9,330,000 shares|$196.58 million|No Change|44.8%|8.4|$21.07|\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe can see that short interest has increased over time up to a high here of 39.4% on 3/15. TD Ameritrade says 45.21% and we know that short interest is not clear cut, so there is some variance on that  SI%. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMost shares were shorted between $21 - $25 and were still shorted on 3/15. What has happened to the price since 3/15? It was driven down to a low of $23.19. As seen on [this chart](https://i.imgur.com/yrwzR6R.jpg). This means that most of the shorts did not become profitable during the biggest drop since the latest SI% report and likely did not cover. There was another seemingly artificial drop on 3/31 down to $24.50 where some shorts may have covered which [I have put a little box around](https://imgur.com/lss7ppj). Why do I say that it is an artificial drop? Because the company absolutely crushed earnings expectations and was trending up the day earnings were released. That premarket drop was clearly induced and may have been an opportunity for some of the shorts to cover with a small profit, but certainly not the majority. I believe SI% is still very high and there is a **squeeze to be squoze**. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSome may attribute the drop in price on 3/31 to the **IPO lockup expiration**. If you don't know what lockup expiration means, \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n&gt;When a company goes public through a traditional IPO, it usually sets a lock-up period of 90 to 180 days during which insiders can't sell their shares. That rule isn't mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission -- it's a self-imposed one that prevents big investors from flooding the market with shares.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nSo, the lockup  expired and insiders can sell their shares, but why would they? They just beat earnings by a lot and should expect their shares to continue to increase in value. Also, there were further restrictions placed on insider sales that a commenter on another ASO DD thread made. I'm assuming it was valid research. Hopefully they can add it to this post because I don't have the full details, but essentially there is a still limit on how much the insiders can sell at one time as to no shift the price too much and that limit is 1% of the company's value. With a $2.64B market cap right now, that is $26.4M, or about 900,000 shares being the limit on insider sales in a day.  It is entirely possible that the lockup expiry was the cause of the 3/31 drop, which would mean that it was not artificial and it was not a plan by shorts to cover. Meaning SI% is still in the 35-45% range. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n**THE STOCK IS UNDERVALUED**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n[According to Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/results-academy-sports-outdoors-inc-052048433.html) the consensus price target is $32. [Simply Wall St](https://imgur.com/Y95DfqK) has a fair value estimate of $49.99. Prior to the company beating EPS expectations by 76%, I was seeing discounted cash flow values of $35/share. [GuruFocus has DCF value at $36.29](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/ASO/dcf). The price has been depressed. Watching the charts for the last month, there have been pretty massive sell walls in the $25 - $29 range, with order books full of those suspicious algorithm share #'s keeping the price from going up to its fair value naturally. With price targets that have not been fully updated for the earnings beat and increasing volume being between $28 - $35, it seems that the worst case scenario is buying in at $30 will net about a 10% gain or loss. That is attractive to boomers, which could increase retail volume.  \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDid someone say **volume**? Average volume was around 1.5M. Since earnings were released there has been an increase in volume: \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n|Date|Volume|Over/(Under) Average|\n--:|:--|:--|\n|26-Mar| 775,000| (725,000)|\n|29-Mar| 2,390,000| 890,000|\n|Earnings Release 30-Mar| 4,880,000| 3,380,000|\n|Lockup Expiry 31-Mar| 5,040,000| 3,540,000|\n|1-Apr| 3,610,000| 2,110,000|\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nPrice at open on the day of earnings release was $24.98. It closed on 4/1 at $29.01 for a 16% increase and kept going up after hours another $1 or another 4%. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLet's see that in a table: \n\n|Date|Open|Close|% Change since earnings||\n:--|--:|--:|--:|:--|\n|26-Mar|23.92|24.59|||\n|29-Mar|24.98|24.23|-3.0%||\n|30-Mar|24.59|26.74|7.0%||\n|31-Mar|25.79|27.05|8.3%||\n|1-Apr|27.08|29.01|16.1%||\n|After Hours|29.01|30.00|20.1%||\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nNow, I said previously that this stock reminds me of RKT. Strong earnings release for a heavily shorted stock and a delayed increase in price due to massive resistance. That resistance was overcome for RKT from massive buying volume as retail jumped on board. Volume really picked up and the RKT flew. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \n|Date|Open|Close|% Change since earnings|\n--:|--:|--:|--:|\n|25-Feb|20.33|19.9|-2.1%|\n|26-Feb|23.33|21.85|7.5%|\n|1-Mar|23|24.3|19.5%|\n|2-Mar|27.34|41.6|104.6%|\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \nI'm not saying that ASO will have a 100% gain this week, but if you look at what's been happening in 2021 (RKT, AMC, Discovery?), when a stock gets attention and momentum with a high SI%, it is entirely possible to jump 100% in a day. ASO seems similar to RKT in terms of having low float, high short interest, consistently beating earnings, and absolute price. The price point is really important here. Most jabronis can afford to buy into a $30 stock. \n  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Indicators** \n \nI don't put a ton of faith in traditional indicators because we live in the Upside Down now, but MACD and RSI both look very promising, with MACD [on the 3-month chart](https://imgur.com/unGgIgg) \"crossing over\" into positive territory on 3/30. This is a bullish sign for the chart watchers. RSI on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts is over 70. Also a bullish indicator. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n**Conclusion** \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFor me, personally, I think ASO is primed to have a big day this week if it volume gets high enough. By big day I mean spiking to anywhere from $45 - $60 before settling back into $35 - $40 and then slowly growing. If it goes any higher than $60 I will definitely be throwing a pizza party for my local store. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \n\nThanks for reading my post. Good luck out there.

We have made no decisions yet. We are thinking about it, but we haven\u2019t made any decisions yet.\n\nThis is a cause for cautious celebration - the CEO stands by his statement, and is serious about keeping the promise. \n\nBut, the emphasis is on cautious.

Theater openings delayed? More shares. AMC can\u2019t pay its interest and debt on schedule? More shares.

Love all the DD on here. u/FreakyPheobe also got a Bloomberg Terminal so let me share all my goodness! Please comment and UPVOTE if you like what you see and I'll post more depending on what you all want to see this summer!! I finally got enough karma to post on WSB so let's GO!!! \n\n*Processing img tu8r6jo3rst61...*\n\nI know you Apes have been waiting to hit the big screen! Well Warner Bros. \"Godzilla vs. Kong\" has infused new life into the jungle and a struggling US box office in 2020, prompting an upward revision in 2Q estimates across Wall Street. Yet it's too soon to draw conclusions. Film delays and \"day-and-date,\" or studios streaming movies on the same day as their theatrical release, are risks. \n\n***1)  \"Godzilla vs Kong\" to Top Box Office Again***\n\nIt's is expected to top box-office charts for a third consecutive weekend with an estimated $8.7 million, bringing gross receipts to $82.6 million, according to Box Office Pro. California's ArcLight shut down last week, Regal's staggered reopening will continue, so the lack of new films this week should pull total receipts 25-30% lower, based on Box Office Pro estimates. ArcLight and Regal should give AMC an edge going into final spring months and even the early months of the summer when Box Office blockbusters usually get released. \n\n*Processing img bf44qo0oust61...*\n\n***2) US Vaccine Available To All in 2Q; Theatres Also Gets Shot in Arm With Reopenings***\n\nWith cinemas only gradually reopening, 1Q21's box office totaled just under $240 million, an 87% plunge from the $1.83 billion in 1Q20. While that's not totally surprising, 2Q results will be much better, given the success of \"Godzilla vs. Kong\" even with only 55% of cinemas open. As Regal &amp; AMC reopens more of its theaters in April, 2Q box office may hit $650 million, based on Box Office pro's projections, despite Disney's decision to release highly anticipated summer movies \"Cruella\" and \"Black Widow\" on its Disney+ service at the same time as they're available in theaters. Warner's \"Mortal Kombat\" will be out on April 16. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing video yksi6cvgwst61...*\n\n***3)  'Godzilla vs. Kong' Monstrous Open Roars Box Office Back to Life Around the World***\n\nFollowing a strong international open, Warner Bros. \"Godzilla vs. Kong\" U.S. release had high expectations leading into the long Easter weekend. Those receipts, coming in slightly above the $13.5 million [the studio initially reported](https://variety.com/2021/film/news/box-office-godzilla-vs-kong-nobody-1234948900/) on Sunday, propel the film\u2019s overall tally to $70 million. After two weeks of release, \u201c[Godzilla vs. Kong](https://variety.com/t/godzilla-vs-kong/)\u201d already ranks as the highest-grossing movie of the pandemic era, surpassing Christoper Nolan\u2019s puzzling sci-fi thriller \u201cTenet,\u201d which ended its theatrical run with $58.4 million.  (Source: Variety Magazine / Variety.com).  This as a step in the right direction leading into the summer blockbuster period as hybrid day-and-date release strategies aren't deterring fans from the theatrical experience. As more vaccines are distributed and theater capacity restrictions are relaxed, expect continued higher box-office receipts. \n\n*Processing img ibudrjf9yst61...*\n\n***4)  AMC Re-Opens California Cinema To Kick-Off Summer Early***\n\nIn a small step toward recovery in the global film industry, AMC, the largest theater operator in the world, announced the reopening of 54 of its California locations in March.

I think there could be a pseudo Renaissance of the movie theatre experience after the pandemic restrictions are lifted, or even eased back. I think it is also a lot more stable than our neighbour's to the south's version in AMC, and with just as much potential upside. (Aside from meme explosion possibility.) I didn't put a huge stake in it, only 400 shares at 12.15, but for me this is about as much as I want to throw at it right now, with the potential to increase my stake in a month or so. Going to feel out the waters some more.\n\nIs this something other people have been looking at recently, and if so, why have you, or have not pulled the trigger?.",

My thought process in purchasing AMC was that people will want to go back to theaters, there are plenty of AMC theaters all around the country, the impending summer blockbuster movie season and that COVID 19 vaccine rates are ramping up all over. \n\nI took profits at around the $18 mark in late January but held onto 3000 shares with hopes things will do better for the long term. Based on your analysis and thoughts how to you think AMC will fare in the coming weeks and months? Would it be advisable for me to hold or just sell since I will still be able to turn a good profit based on the current market price? \n\nThanks!",

        "selftext": "This post is in continuation of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mikm42/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) post I made 2 days back. The response I received was amazing and lot of you were asking for weekly updates. So here goes!\n\n**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tkhtpy8hq6r61.png?width=623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cde4524f9c0f45d083d6370cce81e462640a965c\n\nGameStop continues to be the top discussed stock with more than 27K mentions. AMC dropped from 2nd to 4th position. PLTR gained in mentions and was the second most discussed stock last week due to a long-term deal they won with the U.S Department of Energy which is potentially worth 89 million dollars. ViacomCBS also made it into the top 10 but not in a good way. The company has lost 50% of valuation in the last 2 weeks and the sentiment reflects that. Rest all the companies are regulars in the top 10 list!\n\n**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/brep8x8qq6r61.png?width=623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47be46b91c1230ab01f618066a0344277613d285\n\nAbove is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.\n\n**ViacomCBS($VIAC)** was the company with the most growth in mentions. But, the average sentiment across the mentions was negative given the 50% drop in valuation. The stock had crossed the $100 mark on 22nd March 2021 and has lost more than 50% of its value since then. The market had been over-enthusiastic about the stock since the beginning of 2021 due to its effort of transforming to a streaming giant from a traditional cable media company. However, this enthusiasm was short-lived. There might be some scope for a short-term rebound.\n\n**ASO** was also growing in mentions due to their stellar earnings report. The company reported\n\n* Revenues were US$5.7b, approximately in line with what analysts expected.\n* (EPS) crushed expectations, coming in at US$3.79, an impressive 41% ahead of estimates.\n\n**Humanigen(HGEN)** reported phase 3 results of Lenzilumab\u2122 stating it improves survival without the need for mechanical ventilation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The stock jumped 100% on Monday and has stabilized at around 34% increase from last week. \n\n**MicroVision(MVIS)** stock soared 50% on Wednesday. This is mainly due to Microsoft receiving a U.S. Army contract for augmented reality headsets. (It's estimated to be worth $21.9B over the next 10 years). There has been a lot of rumors stating Microsoft is planning to buy MicroVision which predominantly drove the discussions on MVIS.\n\n**FUBO** stock price has been on a continuous decline for the last 2 months (more than 50% drop) and there is now increasing chatter on whether it is oversold or on the path to a rebound \n\n**SOME FAQ\u2019s:**\n\nHow does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).\n\nWhat is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyze financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments\n\n*Disclaimer : I am not a financial advisor!*",

        "selftext": "Duh, not a financial advisor.\n\nI loved every word of the interview with Adam Aron. He seems to be watching the market volume closely and plan his actions accordingly.\n\nQuote from the article:\n\n*\"the movie-theater chain is once again \u201cunder attack\u201d from short sellers after skirting bankruptcy during the Covid-19 pandemic.*  *The volume of short sales \u2014 bets that the stock will go down \u2014 rose about 50% in March to 73.8 million shares* *\"*\n\nNow, I'm not a market guru but I still believe that AMC are severely undervalued and heavily shorted. Yes, they've accumulated some debt but so have others and they survived through the worst of the pandemic one way or another, which means that the only way to go is UP.\n\nIf anything, they are on route to become winners after the pandemic since the ArcLight Cinemas and Pacific theatres have announced plans to close permanently.\n\n*\"Other theaters have succumbed to the Covid-19-struggle. ArcLight Cinemas and Pacific Theatres, two jointly owned California movie-theater chains, announced plans this week to close permanently, underscoring the still-tenuous state of the industry.\"* \n\nThe heavily discussed topic about the announcement to vote for the right to sell 500 million shares, which lead to significant price drop and short selling activity, has also been discussed by Adam Aron. The response:\n\n*\"If investors at the May 4 annual meeting approve the plan for additional stock, he\u2019ll gain flexibility to buy back debt at a discount or acquire another chain at an attractive price, which would counteract any dilution.\"*\n\nAnd more importantly:\n\n*\"Aron, who has long been known as outspoken, also praised the internet investors who see themselves as fighting against \u201cconventional\u201d market participants, like short sellers who profit when stock prices decline. He connected with Collins, who offers online investment commentary under the username Trey\u2019s Trades, after his 30-year-old son saw a tweet that Collins had sent to his nearly 50,000 followers, known as \u201capes.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cMy hat\u2019s off to you,\u201d Aron said. \u201cI\u2019m well aware that you have been talking about AMC a lot over the last few months and you have, you know, hundreds of thousands of subscribers, tens and tens of thousands of people watching your shows on the YouTube channel,\u201d Aron said.*\n\n*\u201cI actually work for you,\u201d he said, \u201cand for that reason it\u2019s a special reason for me to engage with all of you.\u201d*\n\nRead the last paragraph again. He works for us. So is every CEO on this goddamn planet that you guys have stocks in and hold long term. But he is the one who publicly acknowledged it. \n\nIn summary:\n\n1. Adam Aron acknowledged the rising activity in short selling which influences the price. \n2. He acknowledges the debt so he is acting accordingly.\n3. Competition (at least on the west coast) reduced.\n4. He works for the \"apes\".\n5. No plans to immediately sell the 500 million shares they announced. If things get tough, they have the right to sell 43 million shares to cover debt which means bankruptcy is NOT on the cards.\n\nIt was a tough year for the theatre giant but CEO Adam Aron believes in a bright future. It was a one in a generation economic and health crisis but AMC survived. The only way to go is UP.\n\nP.S. Don't take this as a guarantee. Like many others here, It is my personal DD, not a financial advise. Stay safe.

It has gained 96.33% this past quarter while the S&amp;P have only moved up 2.3% respectively.\n3. AMC has a zacks rank 2# (buy) ranking, basically saying that its positive earning outlook could easily translate to buying pressure which in turn would push the stock up.\n\nAlright, these are my reasons, and whether you agree or not, thanks for reading and please comment on your thoughts.\n\nP.S This not necessarily financial advice, nor am i a financial expert, this is just my humble opinion of the stock.",

        "selftext": "I continue to see people being cautious of the markets, and though the vast majority of you will likely disagree with me, and most likely downvote this, just please read through it before hand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe market if looked at from a simple graph looks absurd in comparison to previous years, 20% growth even after a crash! however, if compared to previous years this is not 'super uncommon' and still possible like 2013 for example. From this point on when I say the markets I am really just referring to the SPY, since its a simple and accurate portrayal of the overall market imo.\n\nsure, there are some stocks that obviously may crash, and are most certainly going to be argued about if they will crash or not, for example AMC, GME, etc. however, the overall market could not be healthier at the moment, we are currently coming out of a pandemic, and the largest companies are gaining more and more business as the smaller mom-and-pop shops are being forced to close due to a lack of business, while companies like AMZN and WMT have become evermore profitable in 2020 (while this may not be good overall, looking at it from a strictly stock market performance stance, its great news) due to this separation, and allowing big companies to do better, it makes sense the market is growing at such a rate (though maybe the 7-8% in march/April may call for a slight correction). \n\ncompanies like CCL, DAL, AAL, and other covid recovery stocks are also improving as their prospects look better going forward, and consumer spending is going to increase as we leave this pandemic behind us. interest rates are extremely low, allowing companies to further increase their profits, and grow as companies, in not creating crazy overvalued companies (there are obvious exceptions)\n\nI see many people worried about inflation, and showing various graphs that have flaws, such as the M1 graph I believe I saw on the home page here, or maybe on a similar subreddit, hinting that there is far too much money in circulation right now, but that graph has only gone up so much because of the shift from M1 not including savings accounts to now including them.\n\nFurthermore, comparing it to the 2000 bubble is not even fair, the 2000 bubble had seen at least 230% growth in the 5 years leading up, we have only seen around 100%. during the 2000 bubble, nobody thought the market would crash, and continue the increase, during this current market however, things couldn't be more different, everyone is trying to guess what will cause the market crash, you see it all over the news, on CNBC, barrons, and then in all the investing subreddits, trying to predict the next market crash. there are no crappy loans like in 2008, and again, like in 2008 nobody really assumed a crash, and everyone assumed house prices would just increase, however that couldn't be more different today, (with the stock market I mean). \n\nI believe this has just been an exceptionally good year, and may continue until 2022 or 2023 even, or may slow down soon, and just consolidate, but personally, I don't see a large drop like everyone is suggesting. If you disagree, that's up to you, but for the love of god, please stop putting graphs that don't prove anything about a crash coming, I've seen 3 different graphs posted make trending, trying to indicate a crash is coming, which I believe are unrelated, or are exaggerated.",

It is more of a customer\u00a0acquisition tool.**\n\nAt the moment \\~85% of fuboTV's revenue comes from its vMVPD subscriptions.

I concede that this is true, **UNLESS** fuboTV is able to subsidize the cost of licensing content by generating additional high-margin revenue from its user base.\n\n**Remember Roku?**\n\nWhen Roku was in its early days of being publicly traded, bears criticized the company because the lion's share of its revenue came from low-margin hardware sales. What bears were missing at the time, and what Roku understood, is that Roku could generate lots of high-margin ad revenue from each user over their lifetime once they entered the Roku ecosystem.\n\nSimilarly with fuboTV, bears are criticizing the company because, presently, the lion's share of its revenue comes from low-margin vMVPD subscriptions. However, as fuboTV rolls out its sports betting platform and as ad revenue growth continues to vastly outpace subscription revenue growth, margins will inevitably expand.\n\nThe key metric right now for fuboTV is its number of subscribers. If fuboTV is able to continue to grow its subscriber base, I am confident that fuboTV will be able to monetize them effectively in the future.\n\n**So, can Fubo execute on its Sportsbook?**\n\nThat is the million dollar question. fuboTV has been [backed by Sky Media](https://www.sportspromedia.com/news/sky-fox-amc-fubotv-sport-business-industry-digest-april-20) since long before fuboTV went public. Sky Media is the largest betting organization in the UK by number of subscribers, and has numerous brands that serve both traditional betting and fantasy soccer. [Comcast acquired Sky Media](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/22/sky-comcast-fox-36-billion-takeover-auction.html) in late 2018, but Sky Media is still a backer of Fubo today along with Disney by virtue of its acquisition of 21st Century Fox.\u00a0\n\nFurthermore, fuboTV recently [acquired Vigtory](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/12/fubotv-to-acquire-vigtory-and-launch-a-sportsbook/) and rebranded it under Fubo Sportsbook. Vigtory was a sports wagering platform that had a 50-75% lower \"vig\" than the average sportsbook. The \"vig\" is the fee you pay to the bookie on each bet that you place, and is baked into the betting odds. Because the \"vig\" usually about 10% at most sportsbooks, bettors need to win well above 50% of their bets in order to make a profit. Vigtory, now Fubo Sportsbook, is taking a Robinhood-style approach to betting by slashing the vig to attract high-volume bettors.\u00a0\n\nAlso, prior to being acquired by fuboTV, Vigtory [struck a deal](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/09/15/2093997/0/en/Vigtory-Announces-Technology-and-Media-Partnership-With-The-Action-Network.html) with the popular sports betting analytics company \"The Action Network\" to have its analytics integrated into Vigtory's wagering platform. This will save Fubo Gaming customers $19.99/mo or $100/yr, which is the [cost of an Action Network subscription](https://www.actionnetwork.com/pricing?intcmp=NavBarLoggedOut&amp;src_brand=actionnetwork). Sportsbooks have typically shied away from providing data and analytics to their customers for fear that they will be beaten. However, Vigtory, now Fubo Sportsbook, realizes that a offering analytics for each bet will create a superior customer experience, foster brand loyalty, and elevate overall activity on the platform.\n\nIf Fubo is able to release a sportsbook that has a significantly lower vig than the competitors plus the added bonus of built-in analytics, I believe that they will be positioned well to absorb signifiant market share.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Fubo Sportsbook](https://preview.redd.it/d1pvz9qjwzu61.png?width=2078&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d551f9060a90dc6f0b6509055947d1ecb8662eb5)\n\n**Exclusive content will come**\n\nOnce Fubo Sportsbook is successfully launched, the key for fuboTV's continued success will be to acquire more exclusive sports content. The more that fuboTV is able to acquire content rights directly from sports leagues, the less they are subjected to the expensive middlemen that are cable networks. Fubo has already taken a step in the right direction by [acquiring exclusive streaming rights for South American Qatar World Cup 2022 Qualifying Matches](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fubotv-acquires-exclusive-streaming-rights-200500425.html). I believe that by 2023 Fubo will win exclusive rights to some NFL content.\n\nBoth Fox and CBS just signed new deals with the NFL that will\u00a0[cost them more than double](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/nfl-tv-rights-deals-explained/z4rlycwog3jz1f6pqdqoegbxf) their previous deals. By the time those new deals are set to take place in 2023, I believe that Fox will have to renege knowing that they can't possibly meet the new financial obligation. Fox only generates $1-1.5B in net profit each year. Their new deal increases their fee to the NFL by $1.2B/yr.\n\nOne Fox backs out, a new network will have to step in and take over the broadcasting rights to those games. Why not Fubo? By then, Fubo will have already been lining the NFL's pockets for more than a year with sports betting revenue. Remember, the [NFL recently announced its three exclusive sports betting partners](https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-announces-tri-exclusive-sports-betting-partners): DraftKings, FanDuel, and Caesar's. By virtue of [Fubo's partnership with Caesar's](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210303005944/en/fuboTV-Secures-Market-Access-Agreements-for-Forthcoming-fubo-Sportsbook-in-Indiana-New-Jersey-Through-Caesars-Entertainment-Inc.), Fubo is included.\n\nWouldn't it be convenient for the NFL to sell broadcasting rights to the same entity that it partners with for betting? I think so. Fubo is also thinking this far ahead, which is why they've been quietly building their own sports network.\n\n**Does the** [**Dish/Draft Kings partnership**](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/draftkings-jumps-on-dish-network-partnership) **spell trouble for Fubo?**\n\nAbsolutely not. If anything, Fubo should view the partnership as validation of its vision.\n\nFirstly, Dish is dying a slow death. They're losing subscribers every day, even on their Sling platform. Today, SlingTV has the same number of subscribers as it had in Q1 2018, and has been [steadily losing subscribers](https://www.statista.com/statistics/867900/sling-tv-quarterly-subscribers/) since it peaked in Q3 2019.\n\nSecondly, the Dish/Draftkings solution fails to reduce latency. Presently, sports/betting enthusiasts watch the game itself on a TV, but have to\u00a0monitor their fantasy/betting on a separate device, rather than having the convenience of viewing the game and their fantasy/bets on the same device. The Dish/DraftKings partnership still doesn't fully solve this problem. If you want to place a bet through DraftKings while watching a game on Dish, you choose the bet that you want to take and then select a button that says \"open to DraftKings\" which sends a link to your phone where you can finalize the bet. Is it an improvement over the current system? Kind of, because its enables you to monitor your bets on the same device that is streaming the game. However, you still need to involve another device in order to place the bet to begin with. Unfortunately for Dish and DraftKings, they will likely never be able to resolve this problem for a multitude of reasons.\n\nFubo's solution of seamlessly\u00a0integrating a streaming platform with a fantasy/betting platform reduces latency and thus will win in the end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Dish\\/DraftKings sports betting integration](https://preview.redd.it/k4mm2ppevzu61.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e37b708e4fadac61a3ac7c083d9d77ef3d91af26)\n\n**Do not underestimate fuboTV's advertising business**\n\nFubo has a highly desirable viewership demographic--sports enthusiasts that are willing to pay almost $1000/yr on sports content.\n\nIn 2020, a year that countless sporting events were canceled and many companies slashed their advertising budgets due to Covid-19, fuboTV, a sports-first streaming platform, still managed to grow its ad revenue by 133%.\n\nNow it is 2021, all televised sports leagues have returned to full participation and most companies have fully reinstated their advertising budgets. A reasonable target for ad revenue in 2021 is $75M, which would be more than 15% of total revenues. Those are all good signs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Fubo Ad Revenue](https://preview.redd.it/dwzu4tmcvzu61.png?width=478&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acc48764f72b701f34a0aef15806e3dd668b906c)\n\n**Valuation and Price Target**\n\nIf management is able to successfully implement Fubo sportsbook on time or ahead of schedule and continue to grow subscribers and ad revenue, I believe that fuboTV will undergo significant multiple expansion. Presently, Fubo is trading at about 6.5x forward sales. Based on the forward P/S ratios of peers DraftKings and Roku, I expect fuboTV's forward P/S ratio to expand to 25-35. This results in my most conservative EOY price target of $80, and most aggressive price target of $115.\u00a0\n\n**YOLO Position**\n\n[YOLO](https://preview.redd.it/h5fsewuaxzu61.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dce427ff0070dd2ab552a0e3f93d616392a695c5)\n\nI also own 2k shares at an avg of $24.75 in a separate account as a LTBH.",

        "selftext": "Don't have enough Karma to post in r/Superstonk so posting here and hope this can be picked up and discussed. \n\n\\*Engage Tin Foil Hats\\*\n\nThere's been considerable and rationale speculation that the DTCC/BlackRock and other entities involved within the GME situation will be holding off the Squeeze until Legislation, such as 003/801 or 007 are approved and added into play.\n\nI'd like to speculate that this is not the case. \n\nFirstly, we're talking about a Trillion Dollar problem. If these entities can't get off their arses and swiftly fix an issue that has plagued the retail financial world for years, then I think we need an overhaul...\n\nSeriously, I would speculate that they have each of these legislations ready to go, however, the DTCC/Gov does not want to make the first move. In previous instances of Crashes and Market Craziness, the SEC/DTCC has been reactive, not proactive and I don't believe they will change their MO for this occasion either, whether in cahoots with the other parties or not. Plausible deniability? Possibly.\n\nOk, so let's place the DTCC/SEC regulations to one side, and as counter-DD, pretend that this isn't a requirement to be in place before the Squeeze begins (not MOASS)... Note, the null-requirement of Legislation is part of my theory so please keep this in mind throughout.\n\nOk, so where would that leave us? Requiring one hell of a Rocket to burst through any resistance put in place by either Shitadel &amp; Co, or DTCC/SEC and Co.  \n\nWell, we know from previous weeks that Whales don't like to spend a lot of money to create results; if anything, they want to spend the minimum possible - HFs are, afterall, a streamlined and successful business. So, what dates line up well with an organic increase, that could easily be attached to with an additional rocket (for extra power)?\n\nYou've probably seen the recent Hype around the FTD Squeeze, being a T+21 occurrence. So, depending on which DD you've been looking at, the dates will vary from yesterday to Monday, 26th April. Basically, anytime between yesterday and now. \n\nI know I haven't mentioned any other threads so far in this post but please take a look at this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mfk7xa/gme\\_price\\_significantly\\_jumps\\_every\\_2122nd/?utm\\_medium=android\\_app&amp;utm\\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mfk7xa/gme_price_significantly_jumps_every_2122nd/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)\n\nThis is one of the original FTD Cycle Posts, now updated by OP with some information on April. \n\nSo, what does OP say about April?\n\n\"If indeed this pattern continues, then it's likely we see a similar pattern around **April 26-28th** (if my ape math is wrong by a day or two, pattern may occur earlier on Friday, **Apr 23rd**).\"\n\nFriday, 23rd. Why is that interesting?\n\nWell, it's this week for a start - this Friday. And secondly, if you read the whole DD, you may have spotted this juicy nugget:\n\n\"Keep in mind, however, if the **21st/22nd trading day** happens to fall on a **Friday**, which is options expiry date, then we may see an **even** **higher price jump**.\"\n\nAlright, so this links back to the date that an organic increase will be made (one that the HF's do not have to influence) and as OP stated, using data from previous FTD Squeezes, if Options expire on the same date, then we MAY see an even higher price jump. \n\nNice! So, we have an an incredibly lucrative event in which the Friendly Whales can attach to, that also happens to fall on a Friday. AKA - a small amount of additional pressure, will result in a much greater increase in price.\n\nHow much truth can be added to this theory? I've been watching the Options Chain for the past few months, and although I have no solid data to add, I can say that this Week's (Fridays) Options Chain looks SPICY:-\n\n* 90,000 Call Options; majority of which, are placed around the $170+ and have high Open Interest on key Strikes, such as $200, $250 etc\n* According to [http://maximum-pain.com/options/GME](http://maximum-pain.com/options/GME) \\- Puts to Calls is just over 0.5, and the only key Put strike is at $300 (New Sweep - this was created yesterday/today). Note, very little downward pressure and unlike other weeks, a non-TOXIC Options Chain. \n* Total OI of 140,000 Options rivals other peak Options weeks\n\nSo, what could this mean for us?\n\nWell, if OP of the 21st/22nd Trading Day is correct, then this Friday would be an amazing time to run a Gamma Squeeze, that would stand a chance of breaking through the current resistance, and if triggered in the final hour of Trading would continue into Monday's Intraday Trading (dependent on the force of the Gamma Squeeze - the number of Shares that will be ITM and haven't been Delta Hedged). \n\nThe increase in price due to the Gamma Squeeze will have an even larger effect on the FTD Squeeze, by setting an even higher baseline price for GME once the FTD Squeeze bursts. \n\nWill this be enough to break through all resistance? Time will tell but I'm very excited to see what happens in Power Hour on Friday, and of course, Monday's FTD Squeeze. \n\nAs additional points to the above, I want to note:\n\n* IV Crush over the past few weeks; including, heavy regulation and tight price channels of the price this week, which leads into...\n* 0 DTE Options (0 Day Options) could be engaged on Friday, with a low-enough IV &amp; similar closing prices (I don't know much about 0 DTE so any help/problems with this, please shout)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a final point on this thread, I have a theory that the God Tier DD released yesterday by u/Blanderson_Snooper and the following post by u/Wild-Gazelle1579 are connected. \n\nGod Tier DD on Community and how HF's are using us as pieces in a chess game: \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mvov2f/the\\_gme\\_wargame\\_a\\_new\\_theory\\_of\\_everything\\_my/?utm\\_medium=android\\_app&amp;utm\\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mvov2f/the_gme_wargame_a_new_theory_of_everything_my/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)\n\nAMC Data / Recent Changes:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mvvzjv/whats\\_shitadels\\_play\\_with\\_amc/?utm\\_medium=android\\_app&amp;utm\\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mvvzjv/whats_shitadels_play_with_amc/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)\n\nAs u/Wild-Gazelle1579 mentions, AMC is the final, hidden weapon that's up Ken's sleeve. Why?\n\n* AMC Community &amp; GME have been close from the very start. We know of them; they know of us. Arguably, GME is the bigger beast BUT this doesn't discount that large SI on AMC. \\*Familiarity\\*\n* There's been rumours' of a Fake Squeeze for some time.\n* AMC SI, along with the Borrow Rate is increasing rapidly\n* We're seeing AMC start to move differently to GME, after months of being almost identical\n\nSo, what will happen?\n\nAMC will Rocket (Fake Squeeze) whilst GME sits on the launchpad. The closeness of the events are purposeful; the familiarity with AMC will stir jealousy, increasing emotional contention and in Shitadel's eyes (and possibly DTCC), lead us to Paperhand. \n\nBuy &amp; HODL GME. It's the only meaningful Rocket, with short-term tendies being outweighed by longer term and ridiculous gains. \n\nNote: in my mind, this doesn't mean that GME will sit on the launchpad for weeks. I think they will be very closely linked in time but there will undoubtedly be a purposeful delay between the two, in the hopes we transition. \n\nTL;DR - Read my brain fart",

        "selftext": " \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR**: ASO looks a lot like RKT did in February when there was a massive spike. Short interest is high (may be over 45%) on a stock that has been steadily rising since its IPO in late 2020. They beat earnings expectations in a similar fashion to RKT (1.09 actual vs. 0.62 expected EPS = 76% beat). Undervalued stock that is primed for a squeeze means bears r fuk. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n  \nOk, for those of you apes with a few wrinkles, I will explain why you might be able to take your wife and her boyfriend and her parents to Red Lobster and order more than water and biscuits. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \n**2021 is the year of the squeezes and the SI% on this bad boy is HIGH**\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \nHedgies have shorted a wide swath of the market, with a focus on retailers. Makes sense, right? The pandemic has hit a lot of retailers hard, forcing a lot of store closures. Academy Sports &amp; Outdoors has been able to thrive through the pandemic for a few reasons: \n \n1. Their stores are mainly located in southern states whose COVID restrictions are far more lax than their northern counterparts. \n  \n2. Guns and ammo. There has been a massive pullback on offering guns and ammo by big box retailers due to a shift in public sentiment due to mass shootings. However, thanks to the pandemic and civil unrest, more people are buying guns than ever. ASO has not curtailed their gun and ammo offerings, which are a recession-proof sales channel right next to liquor.  \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \nRetailers have been shorted massively (see GME) with the shorts expecting that retail will die with the rise of online sales. Maybe they are right in the long term, but for now, people are still going to stores. Here in GA, you wouldn't know there is a pandemic if people weren't wearing masks. The mall parking lots are full. The short interest on ASO was 45.21% on 3/15 according to TD Ameritrade (compare that to 36.6% on RKT in late February). The stock is up 147% since its IPO in October 2020 without any significant dips, which tells us one thing: none of the shorts are in the money.  I first took interest in ASO about a month ago when I saw them at the top of the shorted list. Investing in stocks in January that had high short interest was quite lucrative for me, so I've been trying to continue investing in shorted stocks that appear to have a bright future. Because bears r fuk and squeezes are fun. \n   \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLet's look at the short interest over time for ASO: \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n|Report Date|Total Shares Sold Short|Dollar Volume Sold Short|Change from Previous Report|Percentage of Float Shorted|Days to Cover|Price on Report Date|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|3/15/2021|12,510,000 shares|$308.37 million|+0.8%|39.4%|9.1|$24.65|\n|2/26/2021|12,410,000 shares|$305.04 million|-3.0%|39.1%|8.3|$24.58|\n|2/12/2021|12,790,000 shares|$306.45 million|+24.5%|41.2%|8.9|$23.96|\n|1/29/2021|10,270,000 shares|$262.50 million|+10.1%|33.1%|7.3|$25.56|\n|1/15/2021|9,330,000 shares|$196.58 million|No Change|44.8%|8.4|$21.07|\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe can see that short interest has increased over time up to a high here of 39.4% on 3/15. TD Ameritrade says 45.21% and we know that short interest is not clear cut, so there is some variance on that  SI%. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMost shares were shorted between $21 - $25 and were still shorted on 3/15. What has happened to the price since 3/15? It was driven down to a low of $23.19. As seen on [this chart](https://i.imgur.com/yrwzR6R.jpg). This means that most of the shorts did not become profitable during the biggest drop since the latest SI% report and likely did not cover. There was another seemingly artificial drop on 3/31 down to $24.50 where some shorts may have covered which [I have put a little box around](https://imgur.com/lss7ppj). Why do I say that it is an artificial drop? Because the company absolutely crushed earnings expectations and was trending up the day earnings were released. That premarket drop was clearly induced and may have been an opportunity for some of the shorts to cover with a small profit, but certainly not the majority. I believe SI% is still very high and there is a **squeeze to be squoze**. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSome may attribute the drop in price on 3/31 to the **IPO lockup expiration**. If you don't know what lockup expiration means, \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n&gt;When a company goes public through a traditional IPO, it usually sets a lock-up period of 90 to 180 days during which insiders can't sell their shares. That rule isn't mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission -- it's a self-imposed one that prevents big investors from flooding the market with shares.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nSo, the lockup  expired and insiders can sell their shares, but why would they? They just beat earnings by a lot and should expect their shares to continue to increase in value. Also, there were further restrictions placed on insider sales that a commenter on another ASO DD thread made. I'm assuming it was valid research. Hopefully they can add it to this post because I don't have the full details, but essentially there is a still limit on how much the insiders can sell at one time as to no shift the price too much and that limit is 1% of the company's value. With a $2.64B market cap right now, that is $26.4M, or about 900,000 shares being the limit on insider sales in a day.  It is entirely possible that the lockup expiry was the cause of the 3/31 drop, which would mean that it was not artificial and it was not a plan by shorts to cover. Meaning SI% is still in the 35-45% range. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n**THE STOCK IS UNDERVALUED**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n[According to Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/results-academy-sports-outdoors-inc-052048433.html) the consensus price target is $32. [Simply Wall St](https://imgur.com/Y95DfqK) has a fair value estimate of $49.99. Prior to the company beating EPS expectations by 76%, I was seeing discounted cash flow values of $35/share. [GuruFocus has DCF value at $36.29](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/ASO/dcf). The price has been depressed. Watching the charts for the last month, there have been pretty massive sell walls in the $25 - $29 range, with order books full of those suspicious algorithm share #'s keeping the price from going up to its fair value naturally. With price targets that have not been fully updated for the earnings beat and increasing volume being between $28 - $35, it seems that the worst case scenario is buying in at $30 will net about a 10% gain or loss. That is attractive to boomers, which could increase retail volume.  \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDid someone say **volume**? Average volume was around 1.5M. Since earnings were released there has been an increase in volume: \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n|Date|Volume|Over/(Under) Average|\n--:|:--|:--|\n|26-Mar| 775,000| (725,000)|\n|29-Mar| 2,390,000| 890,000|\n|Earnings Release 30-Mar| 4,880,000| 3,380,000|\n|Lockup Expiry 31-Mar| 5,040,000| 3,540,000|\n|1-Apr| 3,610,000| 2,110,000|\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nPrice at open on the day of earnings release was $24.98. It closed on 4/1 at $29.01 for a 16% increase and kept going up after hours another $1 or another 4%. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLet's see that in a table: \n\n|Date|Open|Close|% Change since earnings||\n:--|--:|--:|--:|:--|\n|26-Mar|23.92|24.59|||\n|29-Mar|24.98|24.23|-3.0%||\n|30-Mar|24.59|26.74|7.0%||\n|31-Mar|25.79|27.05|8.3%||\n|1-Apr|27.08|29.01|16.1%||\n|After Hours|29.01|30.00|20.1%||\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nNow, I said previously that this stock reminds me of RKT. Strong earnings release for a heavily shorted stock and a delayed increase in price due to massive resistance. That resistance was overcome for RKT from massive buying volume as retail jumped on board. Volume really picked up and the RKT flew. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \n|Date|Open|Close|% Change since earnings|\n--:|--:|--:|--:|\n|25-Feb|20.33|19.9|-2.1%|\n|26-Feb|23.33|21.85|7.5%|\n|1-Mar|23|24.3|19.5%|\n|2-Mar|27.34|41.6|104.6%|\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \nI'm not saying that ASO will have a 100% gain this week, but if you look at what's been happening in 2021 (RKT, AMC, Discovery?), when a stock gets attention and momentum with a high SI%, it is entirely possible to jump 100% in a day. ASO seems similar to RKT in terms of having low float, high short interest, consistently beating earnings, and absolute price. The price point is really important here. Most jabronis can afford to buy into a $30 stock. \n  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Indicators** \n \nI don't put a ton of faith in traditional indicators because we live in the Upside Down now, but MACD and RSI both look very promising, with MACD [on the 3-month chart](https://imgur.com/unGgIgg) \"crossing over\" into positive territory on 3/30. This is a bullish sign for the chart watchers. RSI on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts is over 70. Also a bullish indicator. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n**Conclusion** \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFor me, personally, I think ASO is primed to have a big day this week if it volume gets high enough. By big day I mean spiking to anywhere from $45 - $60 before settling back into $35 - $40 and then slowly growing. If it goes any higher than $60 I will definitely be throwing a pizza party for my local store. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \n\nThanks for reading my post. Good luck out there. [Enjoy this video of my dog eating a banana](https://v.redd.it/p23legq9zuo61/DASH_96.mp4). Dogs are apes too.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPositions = 223 shares. [38 calls at various strikes expirations](https://imgur.com/nC2pwHm). I sold 5 calls on Friday just to know what it feels like to close a position with a gain, but will be buying more this week if there are any dips.",

        "selftext": "Exactly what the title says. Plotting options data gives so much insight into why they are priced the way they are. If you're new to options these plots should make it really obvious why weeklies are like lotto tickets, and leaps are much more like owning the stock long term (with leverage).\n\nI find it more helpful than a lot of broker tools, and plotting the actual data gives a quick visual representation of theta. \n\n# QQQ\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o45w2rc1w1u61.png?width=2357&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81ac3d03c3d17e7fb5194dba3657ff143ade3511\n\n# SPY\n\n[Legend is really cluttered.

The market-makers will price options based on based on well-understood underlying assumptions. \n\nCurves of VXX with strike are inversed relative to SPY and QQQ, which I find interesting. This would probably mean the longer time goes on, the higher the expectation volatility comes back up. The higher relative cost of for OTM strikes would indicate that when VIX does eventually spike again, people are betting it will spike quite high, and you pay a premium this insurance. \n\nWith skyrocketing IV, sometimes things get out-of-wack.

Both subjects received attention on Capitol Hill this year after January\u2019s wild trading in Game Stop, AMC Entertainment and other stocks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Gensler also noted potential problems with the current structure of payment for order flow, a common practice on Wall Street whereby trading firms, such as Citadel Securities, pay companies to send them their customers\u2019 orders for execution.\n&gt; \n&gt; Questioned in March how the SEC should regulate bitcoin and other digital assets, Gensler replied that the responsibility could fall across the government depending on how assets such as bitcoin are classified. One of his earliest and most-anticipated decisions as head of the SEC will be whether to allow the creation of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/14/gary-gensler-confirmed-to-lead-the-sec.html\n\nGary Gensler also taught the [Blockchain and Money](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP63UUkfL0onkxF6MYgVa04Fn) course at MIT's Sloan School.",

        "selftext": "**I'm not a financial advisor, nor am I giving any financial advise. This is an entertainment/comedy-nonfactual post. I'm a literal retard posting on WSB with a bias due to having a large position of my portfolio in $ROOT. So, proceed on your own risk... In addition, a lot of my DD was taken from C\\*(i)Tron.**\n\nI'll keep it short and simple... This is a one of a kind DD where the whole DD is basically a TLDR.\n\n1- **Short Interest is 47.36%** (Fintel  2021-03-31). In addition, o**nly 2,000 shares were available for shorting o**n 04-01 2021-04-01 13:08:53 UTC(Fintel) with **a borrow rate of 8.71%!!**(2021-04-01 18:18:33 UTC). To put things into perspective, If there's a short interest of %10,  that's considered high. If there's a short interest of %20 or greater, **that's considered extremely high**. **We had 47.36% on Thursday** so a **short squeeze** is inevitable?\n\nIn comparison **of $ROOTS short interest of 47.6%(2021-03-31), $GME has a short interest of 18.81(2021-03-31) and $AMC 17.31%( 2021-03-31).**\n\n2- Forget about the short squeeze... It also have a very high potential of **gamma squeezing**. The open interest of calls is high above 15$. The open interest of all the calls for Only 16 April is 32,261. In addition, the open interest bellow 15$ is 16,414 **which equals 1,641,400 shares!!!!** .Once it hits and stays above $15, the **gamma squeeze** could take it to a whole **new solar system**.\n\n3-  ROOT is massively **undervalued**, Without factoring the massive short squeeze and Gamma squeeze potential, at $LMND multiple **$ROOT would trade at $65** and if ROOT is successful in capturing 2% of the $266 billion US auto insurance market then just the insurance side is worth **10x(120$).**\n\nBUT... instead of doing Voodoo math, **there is no reason this stock is worth less than its IPO price of $27.**  This is at the cross hairs of disruptive technology that is too strong to ignore.\n\n4- For Growth, the step up in sales and marketing investment appears to be paying off as there is an acceleration in ROOT daily and weekly app downloads this month based on a leading 3rdparty app data(App Annie). Bellow is the Chart:\n\n5-  As the end of 2020, ROOT had 323K auto and 8K renters policies in force. According to the NAIC, **there were a total of 49 auto and 1 renters complaints against ROOT in 2020**. Which **indicates the BS that $ROOT shorts are claiming about customer complaints**. Additionally, I dare you to find any insurance company without complaints.\n\n6- For the past week, everyday even today(weekend), I was receiving a ThinkOrSwim news notification advertising for a class action lawsuit against $ROOT. Some days I even receive it a few times a day, the same notification. The shorts are relentless in pushing this news while you have to keep in mind that Class Action Lawsuits **can take up to several years to conclude**. In addition, I dare you to find an old enough (Billion level company) which didn't or isn't facing a class action lawsuit. In my opinion, It's a distraction and FUD in the news cycle by the Shorts. Class action lawsuits are shitty law firms trying to make a name for themselves(IMO).\n\n7- It has a relatively small market cap of 3.07B and a very small float. It reminds me of $GME preSqueeze when it was 3.5-3.7B now it's(13.39B).\n\n**My short term Price target is 50$+ if a Short Squeeze +/- Gamma squeeze perfectly happens**",

(SENS) is getting ready to ramp up into an explosive 2021 and beyond.\n\n[Link to that DD here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/mpmeuv/my_last_yolo_fighting_diabetes_with_a_short/)\n\nThis week, my screeners and analysis of SENS detected something unique to low-float stocks that is happening with SENS. **SENS has the potential to have a compounded short squeeze and a** ***gamma squeeze*** **by July 2021 if certain events transpire.** In this post, I will explain how SENS' stock value could rise by 1000% gains in a matter of months.\n\nPlease take what I say with a huge grain of salt, do your own research, and do not copy my trades.

If you want to know and understand *why* that is, please check out my previous DD post linked at the top of this post.\n\nWhat you should understand though is that Senseonics only has a small number of shares, but is trading at *huge* volumes that make a squeeze absolutely possible. For these numbers, check out the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SENS/financials?p=SENS) and [Market Beat](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSEAMERICAN/SENS/short-interest/) pages so you can get the up-to-date information.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* SENS only has a float of 269.67M shares (that is public shares available to be traded)\n* SENS market cap at $2.69 is exactly $1Bn, which it hit several times in the last several months. Today, the price is below $1.90...way way low.\n* SENS has an trading volume of 50.387M shares. On the day (Jan 19th) that SENS shot up to almost $3.00, it had a volume of **409M shares**\n\nThese may sound like large numbers, but to put it in perspective, **if 1 Million of us each spent $190 on SENS today (100 shares each), they would collectively control 100M shares or 37% of all SENS floating shares**\n\nThe reality of SENS is that it is being pushed down by short sellers in order to devalue the company. This is because SENS is set to completely disrupt their industry in diabetic treatment, a very heavily monopolized sector of the biomedical industry. We are like ants. By ourselves, we can't do much, but as a unified army, we have already proved that we can push back against hedge funds and short sellers that are maliciously shorting companies in order to drive them under. We saw it with Gamestop, AMC, and many others, and we have been *winning*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[I'm just one ant trying to bite the hand holding the magnifying glass](https://preview.redd.it/et8f41byekt61.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=008128cb4e7ac995bd170abcfae9819f6f9dacd8)\n\n# SENS position for a short squeeze\n\nSome very incredible metrics have come out on SENS thanks to the latest \"Failure to Deliver\" report that was released last night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Data analysis and spreadsheet courtesy of u\\/ifitmovesidriveit](https://preview.redd.it/1p5z1spgfkt61.png?width=705&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0d9d73d791028e7dbe52b6f779acacb620fef28)\n\nNotice that on both March 15th and March 30th, more than 450,000 shares failed to deliver at a time when the share price was hovering at $3.15 and $2.64 respectively. **Senseonics' short interest in February was over 45% of float. Literally half of SENS' volume was short selling**. It's blatant market manipulation and malicious short selling. It's obvious. The SEC won't do anything about it, and we know it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$SENS Market Beat Short Interest Historical Data](https://preview.redd.it/rg5pcvvofkt61.png?width=992&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90b2adcb08ff850d33820a72b4ec6a23fa832d00)\n\nAt the moment, SENS is *still* heavily shorted over 19% of float. As the price falls, the shorts begin to cover, but if the price rises again, these shorts will come back. Why? Because they're nothing if not predictable little bastards.\n\nSENS is the cheapest it has been since it originally squeezed to $5.20, and I suspect that this squeeze did not reach its full potential because there was so much attention on Gamestop and AMC, rightly so. If buyers come back to SENS, the price can easily reach $3 by May, and such a heavy resurgence in the price would both push the latest short sellers out of their positions as well as attract new shorts into a bear trap.\n\nI've already described the potential for the short squeeze in my previous DD, so if you want to read about it in greater detail, please go back to that post and check it out.\n\nNow for the *real* DD I'm here to deliver.\n\n# Understanding a Gamma Squeeze\n\nA gamma squeeze is a situation unique to the options market that can cause a stock price to soar massively as a result of many options rapidly going \"In-the-money\". Typical options writers (market makers and hedge funds) write a significant amount of call options laddering up from lower to higher strike prices. You can write two kinds of call options, covered calls or naked calls. A covered call is a call you sell and you already own the shares to deliver if it gets exercised. A naked call is a call you sell when you *don't* have those shares, so you run the risk of having to buy those shares at market price if it gets exercised.\n\nMost market makers are confident that a stock will never rise to the price they write these options for, so it's typically easy money for them, because statistically, traders who buy calls are the losers. If the price rises sharply as those call options approach their expiration, market makers are encouraged to do something called \"delta hedging\" which means they need to buy shares in order to cover those call options, in the event they get exercised. The reason they do this is because statistically most call options are naked calls, meaning the market maker promises the call buyer \"I will give you 100 shares if you exercise this option.\"\n\nWhat happens if the options buyer has a call for $5 and the price rises to $4.95. Well... the hedge fund starts sweating because they know they don't have those shares on-hand, and if the price goes up just another 5 cents, then they will probably get assigned for the exercised call. So, the hedge fund \"delta hedges\" meaning it \"reduces their delta exposure\" by purchasing 100 shares *before* the price goes above $5. They still lose money, but they won't lose as much money, if the price were to go to ... say ... $6, in which case, they just lost $600 instead of $500 because they would have had to buy those 100 shares at market price.\n\nSo ... **what happens if 200,000 call options suddenly go in the money and NONE OF THEM ARE COVERED**\n\nRemember that a call option is a contract where the seller is *obligated* to sell 100 shares per contract at the strike price, no matter what the market price is. That means 200,000 calls are equal to 200M shares (74% of SENS's float, as it so happens). If 200,000 call options go \"in the money\" meaning, the market price goes over the strike price, then those calls can be exercised for profit, but the *seller* (market maker) has to buy those shares at market price. **200,000 call options becomes 200,000,000 shares that the market makers are forced to buy and** ***deliver*** **to the call option buyers**\n\nIf the market makers don't want to absolutely lose their asses, they will buy shares to cover their calls *before* the option goes in the money. Just like with a short squeeze, the buying pressure this creates causes the price to rise as a consequence, and if enough market makers do this, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\n**This can happen with SENS if the price goes to $5 by July 16th**\n\n# How SENS could be squeezed\n\nSENS is both severly overshorted at 19% of float. If SENS price goes up, those shorts will probably come back, and we may see selling pressure that is 50% of volume again. Such a heavy amount of selling pressure may push the price down, yes, but it would also play into a gamma/short squeeze if enough \"puny little ants\" bought up those shares at the discount.\n\nCompound this with a potential gamma squeeze, and SENS could explode 10x or even 100x its current price in such a situation.\n\nHow? Just look at the [Options Chain](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSEAMERICAN/SENS/options/)\n\nPay close attention to the \"Open Interest\" column and you'll notice that at $5 strike, over 50k call options would be in the money, and more of those options at $5 strike are being bought every day.\n\nAdditionally, open interest on $2-$4.5 strike has been rising steadily every week. At the moment, these options are out of the money, but collectively, these **SENS July options represent 130,896 total call options or 130.896 Million shares of SENS!** What's more, 32,203 calls are already in the money! That's only July though! If we look at the May call options, 21,243 call options are open as of right now up to the $4 strike.\n\n# What do we need to send SENS to the moon?\n\n**Buy and hold bitches.** The strategy still applies.\n\nThe trading volume on SENS is so low, it's disgusting. The price is the lowest it's been in months, and HFs have their boots on SENS' face right now, shorting it into the dirt. But if the price goes up, and SENS announced good news in their Q1 2020  earnings call (some time around May-June) then there is a good chance that we will have a catalyst event.\n\nSENS finally secured their partnership with Ascensia and has formed a new sales and marketing team that went live this month. They have already established insurance partnerships in the US and EU, and now have access to over 200 Million insured lives in the US alone. Even 1% of those 200M people, if they only tried SENS's product once would represent over $200M in revenue for SENS in 2021.\n\nSENS is \\_finally\\_ going to the global market as we speak, and they \\_finally\\_ are expecting to receive FDA approval on their groundbreaking 180-day sensor, and they are going to be completing their study trial on the 365-day sensor in a couple months, after which point, they will likely announce their FDA application for review of their 365-day sensor by mid 2021.\n\n# Reminder of my investment thesis\n\nHedgies are pushing down the price HARD right now so that they do not have to hedge against these call options, and they are doing it with short selling so that they can buy up the shares as cheaply as possible while simultaneously profiting on the shorts and earning premiums on the calls they wrote.\n\nI'm sorry, but this is bullshit. SENS is a good company, and their stock is being manipulated by SENS' competitors and hedge funds so that they do not have to be held responsible for dogshit financial responsibility and piss-poor risk management.\n\nIf you thought the GME and AMC squeeze was huge, then you have no idea what SENS could do. SENS stock is dirt-cheap at $1.90 and there is absolutely no way you can convince me that they aren't an **amazing company for creating the first ever viable 365-day CGM** which every one of their competitors said was impossible.\n\nSENS has the potential to be a huge long-term winner for the medical industry and saving the lives of millions of diabetic patients. The fact that the greed of wall street and competing pharmaceutical companies are able to manipulate the stock market to try to drive this company out of business if fucking criminal, and I'm going to put my money where my mouth is.\n\nAs promised in my previous DD, I'm dedicating at least $500 of each paycheck to SENS. With the price going so low, I decided to more than DOUBLE that, and bought $1,100 of SENS because I'm just one little ant and because FUCK SHORTS, FUCK HEDGIES, AND FUCK BIG PHARMA.\n\n# I'M NOT FUCKING LEAVING! \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[My Senseonics Position update](https://preview.redd.it/2zmz3fatfkt61.png?width=921&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d424d9ab6620b2d5b366b80a815eb4bdd1cbc893)\n\nI just bought another $1,150 (609 shares) of SENS today for $1.890, bringing my total quantity to 1,600 shares at an average cost basis of $2.373.\n\nI'm waiting on an additional $350 funds to settle so that I can add to my $3 calls expiring 7/14. I will update everyone with my options position once the funds are available for me to buy my options.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WARNING I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR**\n\nI believe in SENS as a company and I believe in its stock, but I am making this investment with the understanding that it is very high risk, and nothing is guaranteed in the stock market. Do your own due diligence and make your own decisions. Do not invest without understanding your risk tolerance or having your own strategy, and please take what I say with a huge grain of salt. You are responsible for your own financial decisions, and while I would love to have people joing me en-masse in this movement to save SENSEONICS, I understand it is neither feasible nor safe for everyone to do so.\n\nIn short, gamble at your own risk.",

        "selftext": "**I'm not a financial advisor, nor am I giving any financial advise. This is an entertainment/comedy-nonfactual post. I'm a literal retard posting on WSB with a bias due to having a large position of my portfolio in $ROOT. So, proceed on your own risk... In addition, a lot of my DD was taken from C\\*(i)Tron.**\n\nI'll keep it short and simple... This is a one of a kind DD where the whole DD is basically a TLDR.\n\n 1- **Short Interest is 47.36%** (Fintel  2021-03-31). In addition, o**nly 2,000 shares were available for shorting o**n 04-01 2021-04-01 13:08:53 UTC(Fintel) with **a borrow rate of 8.71%!!**(2021-04-01 18:18:33 UTC). To put things into perspective, If there's a short interest of %10,  that's considered high. If there's a short interest of %20 or greater, **that's considered extremely high**. **We had 47.36% on Thursday** so a **short squeeze** is inevitable? \n\nIn comparison **of $ROOTS short interest of 47.6%(2021-03-31), $GME has a short interest of 18.81(2021-03-31) and $AMC 17.31%( 2021-03-31).** \n\n2- Forget about the short squeeze... It also have a very high potential of **gamma squeezing**. The open interest of calls is high above 15$. The open interest of all the calls for Only 16 April is 32,261. In addition, the open interest bellow 15$ is 16,414 **which equals 1,641,400 shares!!!!** .Once it hits and stays above $15, the **gamma squeeze** could take it to a whole **new solar system**. \n\n3-  ROOT is massively **undervalued**, Without factoring the massive short squeeze and Gamma squeeze potential, at $LMND multiple **$ROOT would trade at $65** and if ROOT is successful in capturing 2% of the $266 billion US auto insurance market then just the insurance side is worth **10x(120$).**\n\nBUT... instead of doing Voodoo math, **there is no reason this stock is worth less than its IPO price of $27.**  This is at the cross hairs of disruptive technology that is too strong to ignore.\n\n4- For Growth, the step up in sales and marketing investment appears to be paying off as there is an acceleration in ROOT daily and weekly app downloads this month based on a leading 3rdparty app data(App Annie). Bellow is the Chart:\n\n[  Daily Downloads \u2013 ROOT \\(Green\\) vs. LMND \\(Blue\\)](https://preview.redd.it/mrtl7dp1o0r61.png?width=846&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4df16d1c5705f4b95677ab1b449705f86afc9769)\n\n5-  As the end of 2020, ROOT had 323K auto and 8K renters policies in force. According to the NAIC, **there were a total of 49 auto and 1 renters complaints against ROOT in 2020**. Which **indicates the BS that $ROOT shorts are claiming about customer complaints**. Additionally, I dare you to find any insurance company without complaints.\n\n6- For the past week, everyday even today(weekend), I was receiving a ThinkOrSwim news notification advertising for a class action lawsuit against $ROOT. Some days I even receive it a few times a day, the same notification. The shorts are relentless in pushing this news while you have to keep in mind that Class Action Lawsuits **can take up to several years to conclude**. In addition, I dare you to find an old enough (Billion level company) which didn't or isn't facing a class action lawsuit. In my opinion, It's a distraction and FUD in the news cycle by the Shorts. Class action lawsuits are shitty law firms trying to make a name for themselves(IMO). \n\n7- It has a relatively small market cap of 3.07B and a very small float. It reminds me of $GME preSqueeze when it was 3.5-3.7B now it's(13.39B). \n\n**My short term Price target is 50$+ if a Short Squeeze +/- Gamma squeeze perfectly happens**",

MedTech stocks were generally better but there was some scattered weakness in biotech and pharma. **Energy** was the only sector lower, with E&amp;Ps and oil-services firms weaker alongside crude oil.\n   * **Big beat for March payrolls:**\n      * Nonfarm payrolls surged 916K in March, the biggest gain since last August and well above the 660K consensus. In addition, the net upward revision to prior months totaled 156K. The unemployment rate fell by 0.2pp to 6.0%, in line with expectations. Household employment increased 609K, the participation rate rose 0.1pp to 61.5% and the employment-population ratio increased 0.2pp to 57.8%. Average hourly earnings fell 0.1% m/m vs expectations for a 0.1% gain, with compositional changes flagged as an overhang. Economist takeaways were positive, highlighting the broad-based job creation (Goldman Sachs said industry breadth hit a 9-month high) and the further room for recovery over the next few months in the industries most adversely impacted by the pandemic. There was some discussion about a return to the pre-pandemic level of jobs by year-end.\n   * **ISM non-manufacturing index posted record high:**\n      * **ISM non-manufacturing index** for March soared to 63.7, beating 58.5 estimate and up from prior month 55.3. Highest reading in series history (from 1997). Business activity index up 13.9 at 69.4, new orders index up 15.3 at 67.2, employment index up 4.5 at 57.2. Prices index rose 2.2 to 74. Respondents noted lifting of Covid restrictions has unleashed pent-up demand while capacity constraints remain a challenge. Elsewhere, March **Markit services PMI** at 60.4, up 0.4% from flash; above Feb's 59.8. Highest since Jul-14. New orders, input, output cost series up sharply. Production, employment, expectations also rose. February **factory orders** were -0.8% as expected following +2.7% in the prior month, while durable goods orders revised down a tenth to -1.2% for the month.

Today it has literally 4 different articles on why you shouldn't buy any m\u00eame stonks one of them titled 'If you bought Gamestop I have bad news.' . My question now is, what is the new material and research they constantly have that justifies that many articles on the same subject, I mena seriously guys 4 in one day. Even theire other articles have a constant clickbaity character with titles as 'Multiply your money X amounts with this stock.' or why did this stock go up being summarised in that well it went up cause stocks sometimes go up.

A lot of apes thought being part of a community ment helping fellow apes out. Those fellow apes are now saying they will be pulling out of AMC and GME due to so called selfish apes. If so than so be it.. I'm posting this becuse I believe WSB is a strong community and am honored to be apart of it. I've been holding GME and AMC sense last December and personally I'm  not selling, because for me GME and AMC are full of childhood memory's, just like toys r us once was till the shorts got it. So now it will remain just that a memory. Thankfully  GME and AMC are still around to give me the opportunity to take my son to GME for his video games and my daughter to AMC for date night as my parents did for me. This is how memory's are made. To see the wonder and joy in a child's eyes, to hear the change in their voice when asked to go to GME or AMC the excitement these two simple little thing can bring to a child face. Makes holding GME and AMC priceless not matter the cost. I believe in helping other out that is what makes friends. That is how powerful community's are built. I told my friends I'm in and I will tell everyone at WSB I will be taking my earnings from *** limited to but more GME and AMC why some may ask? Well becuse that's how roll. Scalp one to make bank to buy more and hold of the others. You are foolish not to.",

We are a team and all in it together. We will conquer this and we WILL reach 100K+++.

If you don't have confidence in this whole squeeze why are you here in the first place? If you do not believe it will go to 100K what makes you think it will hit $30? Just don't be that guy that sold for 3k a share and fucked this up for everyone. Now that all 100% of APES understand I think we are ready! Let's get the fucking adrenaline pumped in!!!

I\u2019ve made a post last time, urging people to be smart with buying AMC and GME, as when the market is green, AMC and GME take big hits. \n\nI was correct. \n\nPeople are just going to comment \u201cYou\u2019re a hedge fund\u201d, \u201cWe\u2019re still buying\u201d I\u2019m not here to tell you what you can, can\u2019t, or, should do with your money. However, I\u2019m here to tell you to be a little smart and invest only what you\u2019re willing to lose that\u2019ll not impact you what-so-ever. \n\nThat being said, last thing our economy needs is a recession. \n\nIf you\u2019re truly in it for the cause, then hold by all means. If you can\u2019t handle the hit, smart thing now would be to brace and not keep risking. \n\nWe will probably see a rapid decline in AMC &amp; GME, big sell offs are going to happen as the whales are going to shift their money into the bull market. \n\nQuarter 2 may not be the best for AMC &amp; GME. Although I will receive a lot of hate under this post, I\u2019m just trying to help new investors understand that prices don\u2019t only go up, they go down as well. Last thing I would want to see is people struggling like \u201808. \n\nSo please, don\u2019t let fomo take you over. Be wise and make good decisions. Always remember a quote from warren buffet; \u201cNever lose money.\u201d \n\nCheers &amp; Good luck.",

One name I came across was Atlas Air, ticker symbol: AAWW. \n\n\\*Not a financial advisor nor is this intended to be an investment recommendation. Just my two cents about a company I found. Everyone should always do their own DD and reach their own conclusions. \n\n**Company Profile:**\n\nThe company operates aircrafts that it leases to a variety of customers. The business is divided up into two main categories: \n\nACMI - the company leases out planes to customers either for chartering pasengers or shipping goods. The customer is responsible for expenses like fuel, landing, and other risks. AAWW is responsible for providing the plane, crew, maintenance, and insurance. \n\nCharter - this segment provides chartered planes to a variety of customers including sports teams, the US military, freight operators, etc. Here, the customer pays AAWW a fixed fee in order to charter passenger or cargo planes. \n\n**2020 Financial Highlights:**\n\n\\-Revenue grew 17% up to $3.2B  \n\\-Net Income grew to $360M  \n\\-2020 Gross Margin expanded to 34% from 30% in 2019  \n\\-Current Assets grew significantly to $1.2B, $845.6M of it in cash  \n\\-Net Debt decreased from $2.9B in 4Q 2019 to $2.02B in 4Q 2020, leverage ratio dropped from 4.4 in 2019 to 2.1 in 2020.   \n\\-Over $1B in cash from operations in FY 2020\n\n**Thesis**\n\nThe company did not provide guidance for FY 2021, something that doesnt bother me. The pandemic is still pressing and likely will be for most of 2021. I wouldnt put much stock into any 2021 guidance given anyway. \n\nI really like this name because of its insanely low valuation and due to the continued need for freight operators. Shipping has obviously been tough due to the pandemic and shipping via ocean is challenging due to the high cost and delayed timing. There is a massive shortage of shipping containers and many shippers are looking for alternative sources to get goods shipped. I think a company like Atlas Air could benefit from that in 2021. Even as the pandemic starts to dwindle down (hopefully), there will still be a huge need for shipping and logistics. sure, people will go out and travel, eat in person, etc... but they will still order online and goods will be in high demand. \n\nThe valuation of the company is insanely low right now. But how can a stock go from $23 to $61 in a year and still be highly undervalued? Right now, the company is trading at a Price/Book of .78 and a price/cash flow of 1.83. Notmany high quality names are going to give you those valuations. \n\nOne other thing I like about this name is their cash build up and deleveraging. This company only had about $100M cash on hand as of 12/31/2020 and like most companies, it cut expenses and capex when the pandemic struck due to the desire to keep cash. Well now they are in a great position to use that excess cash to create value for their shareholders. Management did not make any predications about large stock buybacks, dividends, or acquisitions. I think stock buybacks, something I usually oppose, is the right answer here. The stock is trading under book value and it would make sense to buyback stock here. I dont know the industry well enough to know what names could serve as a strategic acquisition for them. \n\n**Ownership**\n\nOne other interesting note is that Amazon is a shareholder, owning less than 5% of the company. Amazon has warrants that it has excercised in the past. Based on what I can see, Amazon could own more than 10% of the company and appoint a Board member, but it has kept its ownership stake under 5%. As of 12/31/2020, AAWW has 27 airplanes leased to Amazon. \n\nOf the top 5 institutional holdings, 4 have increased their stakes in AAWW (BlackRock, Vanguard, Greenlight Capital, and Donald Smith &amp; Company.)\n\n**Risks**\n\n\\-While I think the Amazon deal is a net positive, there is a risk that Amazon could terminate the agreement. Amazon has the right to terminate the agremeent with or without cause with a 180 day notice. Additionally, if Amazon continues to acquire shares through their warrants, it would dilute existing shareholders. \n\n\\-Air Atlas also does a lot of business with the Department of Defense, Air Mobility Command (AMC). Revenue from AMC represented 24% of total revenue in 2019 and 16% in 2020. While the lowering reliance on them is good, 16% is still a large number. Air Atlas and AMC operate in 2 year contracts and requires strong operational performance from AAWW. Changes to their relationship with AMC could harm the company. \n\n\\-Climate change - if steps are taken to curb carbon footprints through additional regulations or taxes, that would be a net negative for AAWW\n\n\\-Decrease in air freight. I noted this one earlier, but the risk that air transportation demand decreases is a realistic risk. I dont agree with that and think the problems with shipping via oceans could lead to more business for air freight companies. \n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nThis is my first DD post on this form, so I'd be interested to hear people's thoughts (good and bad). \n\nI like this company and continue to read about it. It is cheap and there are certainly reasons for that, but I think the stock is still undervalued. The main premise of this position is: \"Do you trust management to allocate capital correctly here given their large cash balance.\" For me, the answer is yes, but I am mindful of existing relationships that company has with the DoD and Amazon. I have seen plenty of smaller companies get crushed due to existing agreements with larger companies. \n\nRight now, I own a LEAP call option. The Jan 2022 call option with a strike price of 50. I will be holding for the months to come.",

        "selftext": "By now you have likely seen some $ASO talk. There are some other really good DD posts in WSB that cover different aspects of the stock. This post will break down why I'm bullish AF on ASO and why I believe that it could hit $60 or higher in the next few weeks. Before GME gang jumps down my throat, don't worry, I am still hodling. There are other stocks to make money on while that one consolidates and trades sideways for a little while. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR**: ASO looks a lot like RKT did in February when there was a massive spike. Short interest is high (may be over 45%) on a stock that has been steadily rising since its IPO in late 2020. They beat earnings expectations in a similar fashion to RKT (1.09 actual vs. 0.62 expected EPS = 76% beat). Undervalued stock that is primed for a squeeze means bears r fuk. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n  \nOk, for those of you apes with a few wrinkles, I will explain why you might be able to take your wife and her boyfriend and her parents to Red Lobster and order more than water and biscuits. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \n**2021 is the year of the squeezes and the SI% on this bad boy is HIGH**\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \nHedgies have shorted a wide swath of the market, with a focus on retailers. Makes sense, right? The pandemic has hit a lot of retailers hard, forcing a lot of store closures. Academy Sports &amp; Outdoors has been able to thrive through the pandemic for a few reasons: \n \n1. Their stores are mainly located in southern states whose COVID restrictions are far more lax than their northern counterparts. \n  \n2. Guns and ammo. There has been a massive pullback on offering guns and ammo by big box retailers due to a shift in public sentiment due to mass shootings. However, thanks to the pandemic and civil unrest, more people are buying guns than ever. ASO has not curtailed their gun and ammo offerings, which are a recession-proof sales channel right next to liquor.  \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \nRetailers have been shorted massively (see GME) with the shorts expecting that retail will die with the rise of online sales. Maybe they are right in the long term, but for now, people are still going to stores. Here in GA, you wouldn't know there is a pandemic if people weren't wearing masks. The mall parking lots are full. The short interest on ASO was 45.21% on 3/15 according to TD Ameritrade (compare that to 36.6% on RKT in late February). The stock is up 147% since its IPO in October 2020 without any significant dips, which tells us one thing: none of the shorts are in the money.  I first took interest in ASO about a month ago when I saw them at the top of the shorted list. Investing in stocks in January that had high short interest was quite lucrative for me, so I've been trying to continue investing in shorted stocks that appear to have a bright future. Because bears r fuk and squeezes are fun. \n   \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLet's look at the short interest over time for ASO: \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n|Report Date|Total Shares Sold Short|Dollar Volume Sold Short|Change from Previous Report|Percentage of Float Shorted|Days to Cover|Price on Report Date|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|3/15/2021|12,510,000 shares|$308.37 million|+0.8%|39.4%|9.1|$24.65|\n|2/26/2021|12,410,000 shares|$305.04 million|-3.0%|39.1%|8.3|$24.58|\n|2/12/2021|12,790,000 shares|$306.45 million|+24.5%|41.2%|8.9|$23.96|\n|1/29/2021|10,270,000 shares|$262.50 million|+10.1%|33.1%|7.3|$25.56|\n|1/15/2021|9,330,000 shares|$196.58 million|No Change|44.8%|8.4|$21.07|\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe can see that short interest has increased over time up to a high here of 39.4% on 3/15. TD Ameritrade says 45.21% and we know that short interest is not clear cut, so there is some variance on that  SI%. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMost shares were shorted between $21 - $25 and were still shorted on 3/15. What has happened to the price since 3/15? It was driven down to a low of $23.19. As seen on [this chart](https://i.imgur.com/yrwzR6R.jpg). This means that most of the shorts did not become profitable during the biggest drop since the latest SI% report and likely did not cover. There was another seemingly artificial drop on 3/31 down to $24.50 where some shorts may have covered which [I have put a little box around](https://imgur.com/lss7ppj). Why do I say that it is an artificial drop? Because the company absolutely crushed earnings expectations and was trending up the day earnings were released. That premarket drop was clearly induced and may have been an opportunity for some of the shorts to cover with a small profit, but certainly not the majority. I believe SI% is still very high and there is a **squeeze to be squoze**. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSome may attribute the drop in price on 3/31 to the **IPO lockup expiration**. If you don't know what lockup expiration means, \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n&gt;When a company goes public through a traditional IPO, it usually sets a lock-up period of 90 to 180 days during which insiders can't sell their shares. That rule isn't mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission -- it's a self-imposed one that prevents big investors from flooding the market with shares.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nSo, the lockup  expired and insiders can sell their shares, but why would they? They just beat earnings by a lot and should expect their shares to continue to increase in value. Also, there were further restrictions placed on insider sales that a commenter on another ASO DD thread made. I'm assuming it was valid research. Hopefully they can add it to this post because I don't have the full details, but essentially there is a still limit on how much the insiders can sell at one time as to no shift the price too much and that limit is 1% of the company's value. With a $2.64B market cap right now, that is $26.4M, or about 900,000 shares being the limit on insider sales in a day.  It is entirely possible that the lockup expiry was the cause of the 3/31 drop, which would mean that it was not artificial and it was not a plan by shorts to cover. Meaning SI% is still in the 35-45% range. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n**THE STOCK IS UNDERVALUED**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n[According to Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/results-academy-sports-outdoors-inc-052048433.html) the consensus price target is $32. [Simply Wall St](https://imgur.com/Y95DfqK) has a fair value estimate of $49.99. Prior to the company beating EPS expectations by 76%, I was seeing discounted cash flow values of $35/share. [GuruFocus has DCF value at $36.29](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/ASO/dcf). The price has been depressed. Watching the charts for the last month, there have been pretty massive sell walls in the $25 - $29 range, with order books full of those suspicious algorithm share #'s keeping the price from going up to its fair value naturally. With price targets that have not been fully updated for the earnings beat and increasing volume being between $28 - $35, it seems that the worst case scenario is buying in at $30 will net about a 10% gain or loss. That is attractive to boomers, which could increase retail volume.  \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDid someone say **volume**? Average volume was around 1.5M. Since earnings were released there has been an increase in volume: \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n|Date|Volume|Over/(Under) Average|\n--:|:--|:--|\n|26-Mar| 775,000| (725,000)|\n|29-Mar| 2,390,000| 890,000|\n|Earnings Release 30-Mar| 4,880,000| 3,380,000|\n|Lockup Expiry 31-Mar| 5,040,000| 3,540,000|\n|1-Apr| 3,610,000| 2,110,000|\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nPrice at open on the day of earnings release was $24.98. It closed on 4/1 at $29.01 for a 16% increase and kept going up after hours another $1 or another 4%. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLet's see that in a table: \n\n|Date|Open|Close|% Change since earnings||\n:--|--:|--:|--:|:--|\n|26-Mar|23.92|24.59|||\n|29-Mar|24.98|24.23|-3.0%||\n|30-Mar|24.59|26.74|7.0%||\n|31-Mar|25.79|27.05|8.3%||\n|1-Apr|27.08|29.01|16.1%||\n|After Hours|29.01|30.00|20.1%||\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nNow, I said previously that this stock reminds me of RKT. Strong earnings release for a heavily shorted stock and a delayed increase in price due to massive resistance. That resistance was overcome for RKT from massive buying volume as retail jumped on board. Volume really picked up and the RKT flew. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \n|Date|Open|Close|% Change since earnings|\n--:|--:|--:|--:|\n|25-Feb|20.33|19.9|-2.1%|\n|26-Feb|23.33|21.85|7.5%|\n|1-Mar|23|24.3|19.5%|\n|2-Mar|27.34|41.6|104.6%|\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \nI'm not saying that ASO will have a 100% gain this week, but if you look at what's been happening in 2021 (RKT, AMC, Discovery?), when a stock gets attention and momentum with a high SI%, it is entirely possible to jump 100% in a day. ASO seems similar to RKT in terms of having low float, high short interest, consistently beating earnings, and absolute price. The price point is really important here. Most jabronis can afford to buy into a $30 stock. \n  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Indicators** \n \nI don't put a ton of faith in traditional indicators because we live in the Upside Down now, but MACD and RSI both look very promising, with MACD [on the 3-month chart](https://imgur.com/unGgIgg) \"crossing over\" into positive territory on 3/30. This is a bullish sign for the chart watchers. RSI on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts is over 70. Also a bullish indicator. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n**Conclusion** \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFor me, personally, I think ASO is primed to have a big day this week if it volume gets high enough. By big day I mean spiking to anywhere from $45 - $60 before settling back into $35 - $40 and then slowly growing. If it goes any higher than $60 I will definitely be throwing a pizza party for my local store. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \n\nThanks for reading my post. Good luck out there.

The response I received was amazing and lot of you were asking for weekly updates. So here goes!\n\n**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tkhtpy8hq6r61.png?width=623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cde4524f9c0f45d083d6370cce81e462640a965c\n\nGameStop continues to be the top discussed stock with more than 27K mentions. AMC dropped from 2nd to 4th position. PLTR gained in mentions and was the second most discussed stock last week due to a long-term deal they won with the U.S Department of Energy which is potentially worth 89 million dollars. ViacomCBS also made it into the top 10 but not in a good way. The company has lost 50% of valuation in the last 2 weeks and the sentiment reflects that. Rest all the companies are regulars in the top 10 list!\n\n**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/brep8x8qq6r61.png?width=623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47be46b91c1230ab01f618066a0344277613d285\n\nAbove is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.\n\n**ViacomCBS($VIAC)** was the company with the most growth in mentions. But, the average sentiment across the mentions was negative given the 50% drop in valuation. The stock had crossed the $100 mark on 22nd March 2021 and has lost more than 50% of its value since then. The market had been over-enthusiastic about the stock since the beginning of 2021 due to its effort of transforming to a streaming giant from a traditional cable media company. However, this enthusiasm was short-lived. There might be some scope for a short-term rebound.\n\n**ASO** was also growing in mentions due to their stellar earnings report. The company reported\n\n* Revenues were US$5.7b, approximately in line with what analysts expected.\n* (EPS) crushed expectations, coming in at US$3.79, an impressive 41% ahead of estimates.\n\n**Humanigen(HGEN)** reported phase 3 results of Lenzilumab\u2122 stating it improves survival without the need for mechanical ventilation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The stock jumped 100% on Monday and has stabilized at around 34% increase from last week. \n\n**MicroVision(MVIS)** stock soared 50% on Wednesday. This is mainly due to Microsoft receiving a U.S. Army contract for augmented reality headsets. (It's estimated to be worth $21.9B over the next 10 years). There has been a lot of rumors stating Microsoft is planning to buy MicroVision which predominantly drove the discussions on MVIS.\n\n**FUBO** stock price has been on a continuous decline for the last 2 months (more than 50% drop) and there is now increasing chatter on whether it is oversold or on the path to a rebound \n\n**SOME FAQ\u2019s:**\n\nHow does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).\n\nWhat is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyze financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments\n\n*Disclaimer : I am not a financial advisor!*",

        "selftext": " \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR**: ASO looks a lot like RKT did in February when there was a massive spike. Short interest is high (may be over 45%) on a stock that has been steadily rising since its IPO in late 2020. They beat earnings expectations in a similar fashion to RKT (1.09 actual vs. 0.62 expected EPS = 76% beat). Undervalued stock that is primed for a squeeze means bears r fuk. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n  \nOk, for those of you apes with a few wrinkles, I will explain why you might be able to take your wife and her boyfriend and her parents to Red Lobster and order more than water and biscuits. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \n**2021 is the year of the squeezes and the SI% on this bad boy is HIGH**\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \nHedgies have shorted a wide swath of the market, with a focus on retailers. Makes sense, right? The pandemic has hit a lot of retailers hard, forcing a lot of store closures. Academy Sports &amp; Outdoors has been able to thrive through the pandemic for a few reasons: \n \n1. Their stores are mainly located in southern states whose COVID restrictions are far more lax than their northern counterparts. \n  \n2. Guns and ammo. There has been a massive pullback on offering guns and ammo by big box retailers due to a shift in public sentiment due to mass shootings. However, thanks to the pandemic and civil unrest, more people are buying guns than ever. ASO has not curtailed their gun and ammo offerings, which are a recession-proof sales channel right next to liquor.  \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \nRetailers have been shorted massively (see GME) with the shorts expecting that retail will die with the rise of online sales. Maybe they are right in the long term, but for now, people are still going to stores. Here in GA, you wouldn't know there is a pandemic if people weren't wearing masks. The mall parking lots are full. The short interest on ASO was 45.21% on 3/15 according to TD Ameritrade (compare that to 36.6% on RKT in late February). The stock is up 147% since its IPO in October 2020 without any significant dips, which tells us one thing: none of the shorts are in the money.  I first took interest in ASO about a month ago when I saw them at the top of the shorted list. Investing in stocks in January that had high short interest was quite lucrative for me, so I've been trying to continue investing in shorted stocks that appear to have a bright future. Because bears r fuk and squeezes are fun. \n   \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLet's look at the short interest over time for ASO: \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n|Report Date|Total Shares Sold Short|Dollar Volume Sold Short|Change from Previous Report|Percentage of Float Shorted|Days to Cover|Price on Report Date|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|3/15/2021|12,510,000 shares|$308.37 million|+0.8%|39.4%|9.1|$24.65|\n|2/26/2021|12,410,000 shares|$305.04 million|-3.0%|39.1%|8.3|$24.58|\n|2/12/2021|12,790,000 shares|$306.45 million|+24.5%|41.2%|8.9|$23.96|\n|1/29/2021|10,270,000 shares|$262.50 million|+10.1%|33.1%|7.3|$25.56|\n|1/15/2021|9,330,000 shares|$196.58 million|No Change|44.8%|8.4|$21.07|\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe can see that short interest has increased over time up to a high here of 39.4% on 3/15. TD Ameritrade says 45.21% and we know that short interest is not clear cut, so there is some variance on that  SI%. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMost shares were shorted between $21 - $25 and were still shorted on 3/15. What has happened to the price since 3/15? It was driven down to a low of $23.19. As seen on [this chart](https://i.imgur.com/yrwzR6R.jpg). This means that most of the shorts did not become profitable during the biggest drop since the latest SI% report and likely did not cover. There was another seemingly artificial drop on 3/31 down to $24.50 where some shorts may have covered which [I have put a little box around](https://imgur.com/lss7ppj). Why do I say that it is an artificial drop? Because the company absolutely crushed earnings expectations and was trending up the day earnings were released. That premarket drop was clearly induced and may have been an opportunity for some of the shorts to cover with a small profit, but certainly not the majority. I believe SI% is still very high and there is a **squeeze to be squoze**. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSome may attribute the drop in price on 3/31 to the **IPO lockup expiration**. If you don't know what lockup expiration means, \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n&gt;When a company goes public through a traditional IPO, it usually sets a lock-up period of 90 to 180 days during which insiders can't sell their shares. That rule isn't mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission -- it's a self-imposed one that prevents big investors from flooding the market with shares.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nSo, the lockup  expired and insiders can sell their shares, but why would they? They just beat earnings by a lot and should expect their shares to continue to increase in value. Also, there were further restrictions placed on insider sales that a commenter on another ASO DD thread made. I'm assuming it was valid research. Hopefully they can add it to this post because I don't have the full details, but essentially there is a still limit on how much the insiders can sell at one time as to no shift the price too much and that limit is 1% of the company's value. With a $2.64B market cap right now, that is $26.4M, or about 900,000 shares being the limit on insider sales in a day.  It is entirely possible that the lockup expiry was the cause of the 3/31 drop, which would mean that it was not artificial and it was not a plan by shorts to cover. Meaning SI% is still in the 35-45% range. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n**THE STOCK IS UNDERVALUED**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n[According to Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/results-academy-sports-outdoors-inc-052048433.html) the consensus price target is $32. [Simply Wall St](https://imgur.com/Y95DfqK) has a fair value estimate of $49.99. Prior to the company beating EPS expectations by 76%, I was seeing discounted cash flow values of $35/share. [GuruFocus has DCF value at $36.29](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/ASO/dcf). The price has been depressed. Watching the charts for the last month, there have been pretty massive sell walls in the $25 - $29 range, with order books full of those suspicious algorithm share #'s keeping the price from going up to its fair value naturally. With price targets that have not been fully updated for the earnings beat and increasing volume being between $28 - $35, it seems that the worst case scenario is buying in at $30 will net about a 10% gain or loss. That is attractive to boomers, which could increase retail volume.  \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDid someone say **volume**? Average volume was around 1.5M. Since earnings were released there has been an increase in volume: \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n|Date|Volume|Over/(Under) Average|\n--:|:--|:--|\n|26-Mar| 775,000| (725,000)|\n|29-Mar| 2,390,000| 890,000|\n|Earnings Release 30-Mar| 4,880,000| 3,380,000|\n|Lockup Expiry 31-Mar| 5,040,000| 3,540,000|\n|1-Apr| 3,610,000| 2,110,000|\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nPrice at open on the day of earnings release was $24.98. It closed on 4/1 at $29.01 for a 16% increase and kept going up after hours another $1 or another 4%. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLet's see that in a table: \n\n|Date|Open|Close|% Change since earnings||\n:--|--:|--:|--:|:--|\n|26-Mar|23.92|24.59|||\n|29-Mar|24.98|24.23|-3.0%||\n|30-Mar|24.59|26.74|7.0%||\n|31-Mar|25.79|27.05|8.3%||\n|1-Apr|27.08|29.01|16.1%||\n|After Hours|29.01|30.00|20.1%||\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nNow, I said previously that this stock reminds me of RKT. Strong earnings release for a heavily shorted stock and a delayed increase in price due to massive resistance. That resistance was overcome for RKT from massive buying volume as retail jumped on board. Volume really picked up and the RKT flew. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \n|Date|Open|Close|% Change since earnings|\n--:|--:|--:|--:|\n|25-Feb|20.33|19.9|-2.1%|\n|26-Feb|23.33|21.85|7.5%|\n|1-Mar|23|24.3|19.5%|\n|2-Mar|27.34|41.6|104.6%|\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \nI'm not saying that ASO will have a 100% gain this week, but if you look at what's been happening in 2021 (RKT, AMC, Discovery?), when a stock gets attention and momentum with a high SI%, it is entirely possible to jump 100% in a day. ASO seems similar to RKT in terms of having low float, high short interest, consistently beating earnings, and absolute price. The price point is really important here. Most jabronis can afford to buy into a $30 stock. \n  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Indicators** \n \nI don't put a ton of faith in traditional indicators because we live in the Upside Down now, but MACD and RSI both look very promising, with MACD [on the 3-month chart](https://imgur.com/unGgIgg) \"crossing over\" into positive territory on 3/30. This is a bullish sign for the chart watchers. RSI on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts is over 70. Also a bullish indicator. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n**Conclusion** \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFor me, personally, I think ASO is primed to have a big day this week if it volume gets high enough. By big day I mean spiking to anywhere from $45 - $60 before settling back into $35 - $40 and then slowly growing. If it goes any higher than $60 I will definitely be throwing a pizza party for my local store. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \n\nThanks for reading my post. Good luck out there. [Enjoy this video of my dog eating a banana](https://v.redd.it/p23legq9zuo61/DASH_96.mp4). Dogs are apes too.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPositions = 223 shares. [38 calls at various strikes expirations](https://imgur.com/nC2pwHm).

In addition, I dare you to find an old enough (Billion level company) which didn't or isn't facing a class action lawsuit. In my opinion, It's a distraction and FUD in the news cycle by the Shorts.

Bellow is the Chart:\n\n[  Daily Downloads \u2013 ROOT \\(Green\\) vs. LMND \\(Blue\\)](https://preview.redd.it/mrtl7dp1o0r61.png?width=846&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4df16d1c5705f4b95677ab1b449705f86afc9769)\n\n5-  As the end of 2020, ROOT had 323K auto and 8K renters policies in force. According to the NAIC, **there were a total of 49 auto and 1 renters complaints against ROOT in 2020**. Which **indicates the BS that $ROOT shorts are claiming about customer complaints**. Additionally, I dare you to find any insurance company without complaints.\n\n6- For the past week, everyday even today(weekend), I was receiving a ThinkOrSwim news notification advertising for a class action lawsuit against $ROOT. Some days I even receive it a few times a day, the same notification. The shorts are relentless in pushing this news while you have to keep in mind that Class Action Lawsuits **can take up to several years to conclude**. In addition, I dare you to find an old enough (Billion level company) which didn't or isn't facing a class action lawsuit. In my opinion, It's a distraction and FUD in the news cycle by the Shorts. Class action lawsuits are shitty law firms trying to make a name for themselves(IMO). \n\n7- It has a relatively small market cap of 3.07B and a very small float. It reminds me of $GME preSqueeze when it was 3.5-3.7B now it's(13.39B). \n\n**My short term Price target is 50$+ if a Short Squeeze +/- Gamma squeeze perfectly happens**",

Communications services performed well with FB and GOOGL strength. Tech was boosted by AAPL and MSFT. Energy was the only sector lower on the day. Treasuries were mostly firmer led by the five year point of the curve after rates saw some upward pressure on Good Friday when equities were closed. 10s finished above 1.70% again. Dollar weakened vs both yen and euro. Gold finished fractionally higher. WTI crude ended down 4.6%.\n   * **Market was largely supported by combination of upbeat recovery sentiment following better March employment data and fairly well behaved bond yields**. Nonfarm payrolls surged 916K, well above the 660K consensus, while net upward revisions to prior months totaled 156K. Economist takeaways were positive, highlighting the broad-based job creation, the room for further recovery over the next few months in the industries most adversely impacted by the pandemic and the lack of upward pressure on wages.

Also called on other nations to avoid pre-emptive fiscal tightening. **US vaccine outperformance continues** with seven-day average of 3M+ doses per day, seemingly overshadowing some concerns about a **potential fourth wave**.

MSFT and AAPL helped boost **tech**, with the semi space mostly higher as well. **Consumer staples** were a touch behind on food losses though good gains among drug stores, grocers, and beverages. **Industrials** trailed a bit though transports, A&amp;D, and multis performed well. **Materials** **lagged somewhat with packaging performing well while precious metal miners lagged. Financials** lagged with banks mixed and tech lending lower. **Healthcare** was a relative underperformer.

Average hourly earnings fell 0.1% m/m vs expectations for a 0.1% gain, with compositional changes flagged as an overhang.

Today it has literally 4 different articles on why you shouldn't buy any m\u00eame stonks one of them titled 'If you bought Gamestop I have bad news.' . My question now is, what is the new material and research they constantly have that justifies that many articles on the same subject, I mena seriously guys 4 in one day. Even theire other articles have a constant clickbaity character with titles as 'Multiply your money X amounts with this stock.' or why did this stock go up being summarised in that well it went up cause stocks sometimes go up. Always presented with emotionally charged pictures trying to sway unsure people reading their articles. So it's not really a question at the end of the day more like a rant, take it or leave it..",

If so than so be it.. I'm posting this becuse I believe WSB is a strong community and am honored to be apart of it. I've been holding GME and AMC sense last December and personally I'm  not selling, because for me GME and AMC are full of childhood memory's, just like toys r us once was till the shorts got it. So now it will remain just that a memory. Thankfully  GME and AMC are still around to give me the opportunity to take my son to GME for his video games and my daughter to AMC for date night as my parents did for me. This is how memory's are made. To see the wonder and joy in a child's eyes, to hear the change in their voice when asked to go to GME or AMC the excitement these two simple little thing can bring to a child face. Makes holding GME and AMC priceless not matter the cost. I believe in helping other out that is what makes friends. That is how powerful community's are built. I told my friends I'm in and I will tell everyone at WSB I will be taking my earnings from *** limited to but more GME and AMC why some may ask? Well becuse that's how roll.

Iv had material before for me to record my vote but never someone calling me to tell me how the board will be voting and asking if i want to align my vote with them.",

I\u2019ve made a post last time, urging people to be smart with buying AMC and GME, as when the market is green, AMC and GME take big hits. \n\nI was correct. \n\nPeople are just going to comment \u201cYou\u2019re a hedge fund\u201d, \u201cWe\u2019re still buying\u201d I\u2019m not here to tell you what you can, can\u2019t, or, should do with your money. However, I\u2019m here to tell you to be a little smart and invest only what you\u2019re willing to lose that\u2019ll not impact you what-so-ever. \n\nThat being said, last thing our economy needs is a recession. \n\nIf you\u2019re truly in it for the cause, then hold by all means. If you can\u2019t handle the hit, smart thing now would be to brace and not keep risking. \n\nWe will probably see a rapid decline in AMC &amp; GME, big sell offs are going to happen as the whales are going to shift their money into the bull market. \n\nQuarter 2 may not be the best for AMC &amp; GME. Although I will receive a lot of hate under this post, I\u2019m just trying to help new investors understand that prices don\u2019t only go up, they go down as well. Last thing I would want to see is people struggling like \u201808. \n\nSo please, don\u2019t let fomo take you over. Be wise and make good decisions. Always remember a quote from warren buffet; \u201cNever lose money.\u201d \n\nCheers &amp; Good luck.",

So why are   they giving up easy tendies and selling hype, or why can't they anymore?\n\nOh, and even though we didn't get to play stonks today, DONT WORRY, the shorts got to play! More at the bottom.\n\n**Intro Material:**\n\n*A    SPAC, Special Acquisition Company, is a way to get a bunch of money  to   take a company public, but it's basically nothing, just a pile of   money  that's looking to buy into a company and behind closed doors,   make an  agreement that gets the company listed.*\n\nSPAC's became a large part of the market since COVID, and banks and funds have been making SHIT TONS off of them.\n\n*\"In 2020, underwriters were the kings of Wall Street.*\n\n*The    biggest investment banks recorded better-than-expected  years, even    though a global pandemic sent shockwaves through businesses  and    households. No business grew more than their operations selling  stocks.    In the spring, clients bracing for economic trouble turned to stock    markets to raise cash.* [*In the latter part of 2020*](https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-flock-to-spacs-where-risks-lurk-and-track-records-are-poor-11605263402?mod=article_inline)*,     it was the SPACs\u2014special-purpose acquisition vehicles\u2014that raised     billions of dollars as a quick and suddenly popular way to get more     companies into* [*the public markets\u2019 wide-open arms*](https://www.wsj.com/articles/lessons-from-a-crazy-year-in-financial-markets-11609410602?mod=article_inline)*.

The surge in SPAC's    can also be said to have helped the recovery from the COVID crash,  and   it looks like they thought it would keep going well into 2021...\n\nBelow    is an ETF of SPACs, and you can see the nice run up until Jerome    Powell announces that the SLR Exception isn't going continue past March:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zrmamj77quq61.png?width=1194&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b40def2bb79c1e0fd8343459ebc413b199eddd7\n\nPurple Line is Powell Saying SLR Exception Won't Be Extended\n\nI've   seen many posts  commenting how the \"SPAC Crash\" is due to market   rotation, or consumer  cyclicals, or fears of COVID, yada yada. **I obviously don't know what caused it**,    but seems to match up pretty damn good with Banks being told they   don't  get to keep all the capital they'd been holding without following    SLR...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Look and see who all has been underwriting all the SPACS:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bucztsj5quq61.png?width=1278&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=305a8c3be18395f42d5cfe211b8b866651bafff0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTop 10 Underwriters for 2021\n\n[**https://www.spacresearch.com/underwriter**](https://www.spacresearch.com/underwriter)\n\nCitigroup, GoldmanSachs, CreditSuisse, MorganStanley, Deutsche Bank, Bank of America, JP Morgan....\n\nThere's    86 on that list, and most of them aren't major banks, though Credit   Suisse and Citi have the bulk from 2020, but the others are described as   \"boutique, private  financial investment firms\" and you can call some   of them Hedge Funds,  and you can call some of them Shirley.\n\nDoesn't matter, but these are the players who have been making BANK over the last year... up till now.\n\nSo let's start to look at some of the other firms on that list,...\n\nlike **Oppenheimer** because **he has become death, destroyer of worlds**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/my56u2n9quq61.png?width=1027&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=142aedec0ff4d751195f926d1709cf2323e1d747\n\nCheck out the Red Box for your own viewing pleasure\n\nNow    let's open up a favorite website of mine that doesn't have the most  up   to date data, but does have a pretty wide range of info on hedge  fund   holdings and shareholders, and you can even check out cashflow: **HedgeFollow**\n\nHere's the top shareholders for Oppenheimer ( just one of the underwriters from the SPAC list)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lbhkf0gaquq61.png?width=1093&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75f0a105fe629aa28c5e02a8508f1155c028b8ee\n\nhttps://hedgefollow.com/stocks/OPY\n\nHi Citadel! (Waves)\n\nYea, **there's all sorts of goodies**    in the SPAC underwriters. Most of them are pretty incestuous when it    comes to ownership, with a TON of overlap between them all, many of  them   just kinda own each other, and that one owns the other back...  round   and round.\n\n**Anyway, what the hell's my point?**\n\nSo    we've been told that Bill Hwang blew up Credit Suisse and probably   half  of all the major banks, but it probably deeper than all that...    actually YEA.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Last year, as of Sept 8 2020, Hedge Funds starting to go long on ViacomCBS, not just Billy Hwang.**\n\n[\\[YahooFinanceArticle\\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/avoid-viacomcbs-inc-viac-142213772.html)\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat's    that mean, no idea, but probably all of them doing something with it    selling off stuff after the merger, maybe, who knows..... shitty  guess,  they wanted a fall guy so they use the \"Bad Boy\"\n\n**Speculating won't do us any good though, so let's just look at how some of the banks are doing.**\n\nGoldman Sachs lays out how the chart reads for those apes not familiar with **IBorrowDesk** but it usually has updated info every 15 minutes on available shares for a company.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ayzny2ubquq61.png?width=1194&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebb021b76e2ee0d245e0f570db08d0bd26eebfb5\n\nGoldman Sachs is  getting shorted the last few days.\n\nAs    of now it seems that most of the action is concentrated in the   European  based banks, and we're starting to see them get shorted, some   of them  shorted HARD!!! Bank of America, Wells Fargo didn't show   anything since  the site maxes out at 10M shares available.\n\nThe   Swiss have taken the first hit, media's been focusing on them for the    last few days, and the red arrows show the change in available shorts    TODAY! Good Friday.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4yhx1c7equq61.png?width=1171&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=214df469ab1493c18862db19fa0ce00da4160ead\n\nLooks   like Thursday HF's bought back shares they shorted CS with, only to   short it again today. BUT, It's still above the average of the last   year.\n\nI would assume that after   the Swiss Bank fell to COVID levels they'd stop shorting, but NOPE!   They're still going at it, granted not AS BAD, but how much lower do   they think it will fall?\n\nThe Germans have been seeing a rounding of shorts for most of March:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/prsaroyequq61.png?width=1175&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89fc70ffd9722cc5f67ca25522ba3086343c81ff\n\nHF's have been shorting the Germans for most of March.\n\nAnd for those APEs that have read \"The Everything Short\" you're going to love this next one!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rhg6hxufquq61.png?width=1183&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4dd27a123753dca48d3bd3fc13ecf1cc926ea4b3\n\nYea, there's only about a handful of shares left for the bonds.\n\n**So what's it all mean.....MMMMAAAANNNNNN.......?**\n\n1. TLT is shorted to hell (Everything Short)\n2. HF's and Banks aren't making the returns from fees and selling SPACS (most of them) like they had in 2020...\n3. OR....    HF's are getting out of SPACsto have to cover shorts for GME or T   Notes  or AMC or .... USE WHICHEVER FLAVOR OF CONFIRMATION BIAS GOES   WELL WITH  YOUR PEEPS!  I sure as hell don't know.\n4. I'm    leanings towards it's not making me want to go out and buy SPY calls,    and maybe April Fools was the SPY hitting FOUR OH OH so that they  could   shoot it over the weekend, but again, I'm posting here, not WSJ.\n\nAs always, don't trust anyone on the internet, call your mother, and none of us are flossing enough.\n\n**Order of Links Used BECAUSE I BARELY SCRATCHED THE SURFACE:**\n\n* [**https://www.spacresearch.com/underwriter**](https://www.spacresearch.com/underwriter)\n* [https://hedgefollow.com/stocks/OPY](https://hedgefollow.com/stocks/OPY)\n* [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/DB)",

My question; at this point, looking at utilization, borrow rates, etc., what makes GME in a better spot right now with the price target it\u2019s at now? Is the short float % in better shape? Is the squeeze ceiling higher due to smaller outstanding shares? I\u2019m not asking in a condescending way.

Basically, they have tons of space that sits empty most of the time. \n\nMost movie theaters have thousands of square feet that sit unused most of them time.\n\nLease that space to Univ of Phoenix ....or more legitimate programs, Gaming tournaments on the big screens, the court systems since most stuff will now be remote even after the pandemic.\n\nEdit, Also note that most people hate cable. And one of the only reasons people pay for cable TV is for the sports packages.....So why not sell a la carte sports viewing packages. Yes...huge legal work to get thru with rights...but still. I would pay to watch a red wings game in a theater.\n\nGet better food\n\nGet robot waiters to bring me the better food.\n\nNeed to get every SF into revenue generating space. 8am-5pm is a business day and hardly anyone goes to the movies then.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you apes think?\n\n\\-Banana Stand?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks to [u/jfwelll/](https://www.reddit.com/user/jfwelll/)  and others for such detailed posts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/midao4/lets\\_just\\_take\\_over\\_amc/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/midao4/lets_just_take_over_amc/)",

        "selftext": "**I'm not a financial advisor, nor am I giving any financial advise. This is an entertainment/comedy-nonfactual post. I'm a literal retard posting on WSB with a bias due to having a large position of my portfolio in $ROOT. So, proceed on your own risk...**\n\nPreview:\n\n[Fintel Short Interest Data!](https://preview.redd.it/l8moqcogukq61.png?width=1836&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb02a6bbc8929d5809fa56b750b80b172e5132fb)\n\n# TLDR; $ROOT has a rare Short Squeeze opportunity with a Short interest of 47.36%! In addition to it being undervalued.\n\n# So What's Root?\n\n**In ape language:** It's a car Insurance technology which relies on machine learning to provide personalized insurance rates. Their business model has fairness and modern customer experience as core values (Check their app/website).\n\n(Boring details) **Details about ROOT:** Traditional Credit-Based Car Insurance Perpetuates Economic and Racial Inequalities as one in three American cannot afford essentials because of car insurance premiums. $ROOT is the only insurance carrier where 100% of customers have the app installed, which $Root uses to collect better data that gives it **a \u201cfour-year head start\u201d** in being able to better price insurance on actual driving behavior.\n\nWith over 10 billion miles of driving data and hundreds of thousands of actual claims, $ROOT has the best data analytics in the industry, As the company noted in it's S-1. The objective is simple, 50% of the claims in dollar terms come from 10-15% of the worst drivers.\n\n# Big boys invested in ROOT\n\nFive months ago, Silver Lake and early Snowflake investor Dragoneer each invested $250 million in $ROOT over 100% higher at the IPO price of $27.  Hill house also added to their previous investment at $27.\n\nTwo years ago, $ROOT raised $350 million in its Series E Funding from top tech investors including Coatue, DST Global, Red point Ventures,and Tiger Global at a valuation of $3.65 billion **or over 20% higher than ROOT\u2019s market cap today**. Ribbit Capital, which is founded by MELI board member Meyer Malka, participated in ROOT\u2019s Series E Funding and then proceed to buy 1 million shares at the IPO price of $27 and an additional 754K shares in the open market at $16.55.\n\n(important) **Rarely, do investors get the opportunity to invest in a disruptive technology company at a significant discount to the prices paid by the worlds leading tech investors  who had the ability to do a deep dive into the technology and cohort data.**\n\n# Why did it get FUCKED by WallStreet in the last 3 months?\n\nLast year was a bad year for an auto insurance company to go public with so much uncertainty around the future of the business due to COVID. Even the bears will admit, $ROOT has great management that knows insurance and technology. However, $ROOT has done a poor job of telling their story to WallStreet(Fuck WallStreet, I'm hopeful that Retail will believe in it as much as we do in $AMC).\n\nThe good news is that this can easily be changed while $ROOT has built the hardest part(The technology). $**ROOT has experienced its share of short reports and fraud claims and broken business models arguments...**\n\nThe original bear argument was centered around $ROOT\u2019s high loss ratios vs.competitors.  However, **ROOT disproved the bear case with additional disclosure in the company\u2019s Q4 2020 shareholder letter showing that it is important to consider** that ROOT has a younger customer base and to analyze loss ratios by cohort rather than on an aggregate level given that ROOT\u2019s loss ratios improve significantly as the customer base ages.\n\n# Root 2021 Growth\n\nGrowth is Re-Accelerating Based on 3rd PartyData. After intentionally pulling back on growth last year due to uncertainty around COVID, management is focused on accelerating growth this year. **As noted by ROOT CFO Daniel Rosenthal on the Q4 2020 earnings call:**\n\n\u201cWe were able to show strong growth despite the decision to pull back on marketing spend towards the end of the first quarter resulting from the global pandemic and surrounding macroeconomic and regulatory uncertainty.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe plan to more than double our sales and marketing investments in 2021following a COVID-driven pullback in 2020. This investment in marketing fuels an accelerating growth trajectory throughout the year.\u201d\n\nThis step up in sales and marketing investment appears to be paying off as there is an acceleration in ROOT daily and weekly app downloads this month based on a leading 3rdparty app data(App Annie).\n\n**Daily Downloads \u2013 ROOT (Green) vs. LMND (Blue)**\n\n[Daily Downloads \u2013 ROOT vs. LMND](https://preview.redd.it/xznvm6vnukq61.png?width=846&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff9268c390d6e6ab44fe070c1521b58cd038c288)\n\n# Now for the Most important Part!\n\n**$ROOT has a short interest of 47.36% Float as of 03/31/2021(Fintel). To put that into perspective, If there's a short interest of %10 that's considered high. If there's a short interest of %20 or greater that's considered extremely high. When $GME hit %140 short interest that was a rare event. Now $ROOT has 47.36% Short interest Float!!!!!**\n\nIn comparison, as of 03/31/2021, $GME has a short interest of 18.81%, $AMC 17.31%!!! %ROOT is sitting on 47.36%(FINTEL)\n\n# Price Target\n\nWithout factoring the massive short squeeze potential, at $LMND multiple **$ROOT would trade at $65** and if ROOT is successful in capturing 2% of the $266 billion US auto insurance market then just the insurance side is worth **10x(120$).**\n\nBUT... instead of doing Voodoo math, **there is no reason this stock is worth less than its IPO price of $27.**  This is at the cross hairs of disruptive technology that is too strong to ignore.\n\n\"This is a disruptive tech company and investors have an opportunity to buy the stock at bargain prices vs. what the smartest tech investors in the world paid just five months ago.\" C\\*Tron\n\n**If a full short squeeze happens, In my opinion, this can reach 50$+ short term.**\n\nResources:\n\nA lot of the DD came from C\\*(i)TRON",

        "selftext": "Hello my fellow Apes! It\u2019s your friendly neighbor CrayonEatter (Chris 801). As you know BlackRock has heavily invested in AMC with around 5,926,369 shares. This ranks them as number 3 behind Wanda and Vanguard.  \n\nOk, here is where things get juicy, and yes I mean juicy. Did you know Adam Aron is on multiple boards of directors? Well he is! FYI this is quite common for most CEOs, but I digress. Adam is currently attached to two other boards; Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. and Gaming and Leisure Properties Inc. I was up late last night, and I was going through Adam Aron\u2019s statement of ownership and it led me through this rabbit hole.\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=0001032673](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=0001032673) \n\nSo after seeing Adam Aron\u2019s SOO (Statement Of Ownership), it led me to Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, which I found out he used to be the CEO of the company, and is now just a board member. When I looked at the Fintel filings on Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, I was shocked to see similar institutions holding their shares. Could this just be a coincidence? Both BlackRock and Vanguard are the top institutional investors. \n\n[https://fintel.io/so/us/nclh](https://fintel.io/so/us/nclh)\n\nThis gave me the smooth brain ape idea to check on the other board of directors he sits on.  He currently sits on the Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. board. What did I find? The exact same institutions involved with top ownership of the company. I would like to refer to the old saying: \n\nIt happens once it's an occurrence, if it happens twice it\u2019s a coincidence/chance, and three times it\u2019s a trend. Well Blackrock and Vanguard both top institutional investors once again.\n\n[https://fintel.io/so/us/glpi](https://fintel.io/so/us/glpi) \n\nWhy is this significant? It's because it shows a trend that BlackRock, Vanguard, and Adam Aron are bullish on one another. This is important because Blackrock believes that Aron is a money maker, and also it shows we don\u2019t have to worry about Blackrock fire selling their shares or doing anything else shady. It also shows they have a true business relationship, and what better way to keep that relationship is to have the mother of all squeezes happen. After the squeeze, BlackRock with all its new tendies can buy a big portion of the upcoming 500 million shares issued by AMC. SO FEAR NOT APES! I can say BlackRock is our friend and ally when it comes to this war with Shitadel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot a Financial advisor. This is not financial advice.",

As they started doing this things, they hiked the prices and fees up to show movies at theaters, and started locking other movies up in their vaults preventing them from being seen at all.\n\nAs we all know, in the international markets China is the number one income sources for films overseas. Disney has notoriously edited films to all hell, met outrageous demands, and done things specifically for the Chinese markets just to keep making money for them.\n\nOut of nowhere, the COVID-19 virus shows up, from China, and shuts down the entire country.\n\nThe SLR rule is put into place. Hedge funds can leverage positions with near infinite amounts of money. \n\nHedge funds Target AMC and try to short it into bankruptcy. \n\nWhy? \n\nThinking about Disney\u2019s plans to get movie theater restrictions increased and leveraging streaming services online for a more steady and long-term income source to provide the house of mouse with infinite liquidity, it makes sense to me. Disney privately funded the Short on AMC to close down the movie theater industry in almost it\u2019s entirety in order to force people to sit home and buy subscriptions to their streaming services. \n\nI\u2019m not going to say that Disney orchestrated COVID-19, released it into the world, to shut down movies, to force people to stay home and buy movie subscriptions, but it makes sense.\n\nAnd thats why it\u2019s so hard to squeeze AMC. Because fucking Mickey Mouse wants AMC to go bankrupt and shut all it\u2019s doors forever so they can make the most money in the long wrong. They stand to make the most money. Forever.\n\nAnd then we showed up. And fucked up the entire plan. \n\nIv\u2019e been thinking about it for a little while. Over a year now. Since the YouTube videos came out and I\u2019ve been doing nothing during the pandemic except buying and holding. \n\n\nTLDR: Mickey Mouse is trying to bankrupt AMC to force people to buy Disney+ subscriptions.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Tinfoil hats in the comments.",

        "selftext": "For reference, I have already stated my bull thesis on AMC to be a recovery play. This merely a theory and I wanted to get some opinions.\n\nThis is the theory I had...\n\nIf Disney were to acquire AMC, it could reasonably wipe out the existing debt at the start and be making $1B+ in net profit each year from the acquisition alone once Covid ends. The reason why I say it\u2019s the holy trinity of acquisitions is you have a company that would have a proven streaming service, production of the some of the highest grossing movies, and then you add theater\u2019s to the mix. \n\nWhat would this mean for all other theater companies? It would be the end of all of them because Disney alone would command viewers by releasing their productions in their theaters first.\n\nIf Disney acquired the biggest theater company in the world, AMC, it would shatter the theater industry leaving only Disney remaining. Let\u2019s say Disney also could improve profit margins on snacks and drinks and raise net profits due to having better existing connections to snack and candy manufacturers respectively.\n\nWhat gives? Why would Disney do that? They could purchase AMC for less than what it\u2019s worth because of their debt. It would likely not bode well for current AMC investors, but it could go either way in terms of a valuation. It could benefit some and not others based on price entry points. Or it may drive the current stock price of AMC into overdrive considering what this deal means which is that Disney, being a movie producer, can now also own theaters based on the removal of the Paramount Consent Decree last year. This means a legal monopoly on theaters if studio companies like Disney, HBO, or Amazon decided to throw their weight around.\n\nPlus as of April, 2021 there is also some news articles coming out about dissenting theater companies not wanting to play Disney movies in their theaters due to unfavorable contractual conditions. \n\n\u201cWe haven't made any threats,\" AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. Chief Executive Adam Aron said in reference to \"Black Widow.\" But \"it is widely known that AMC has threatened not to play movies if we could not find business terms that we found acceptable,\" he said.\n\nHowever it is my belief that not one existing theater would be able to compete with the likes and funding of Disney if they decided to acquire AMC unless other theater companies too found a studio production company to buy them out.",

        "selftext": " \n\nHi everyone,\n\nFirst time poster and just started trading options a couple weeks ago. Ive been stock trading for a while and figured it was time to give options a go as i could see the benefit of paying premiums as opposed to tying up my whole portfolio.\n\nLast week i had purchased some options, these particular ones were:\n\nNLS 5/21 puts with a strike of $15 @ 1.31\n\nNLS 5/21 puts with a strike of 12.550 at 1.13\n\nsA couple days after i bought them i was up about 40% on them and sold them a day or two later to lock in some profit. i was not ITM (i think it briefly dipped into the money) when i sold but saw some pretty steep profit with minimal price movement.\n\nFast forward to this week and i boughht some of the following:\n\nAMC 4/16 puts with a strike of 10 @ 1.13.\n\nAMC 4/16 puts with strike of 9.50 @ 1.10\n\nNow these AMC puts went negative like 50% within a day or two. The first question is why would they swing so quickly into the negative with still so many days out. I would assume its because AMC went up a bit the days following but it wasnt very much , definitely less than $1 on the stock price.\n\nSecondly, the offering gave a huge sell off that put me into the money on both of the puts but they are still showing negative. Now i know that i lose value on my options in time, but these were bought on 3/25, so about a week now with still another 2 weeks left. Why did they decay so fast? im looking at the volitility to explain the deep loss even now that im ITM and i would assume that i overpaid because of the IV?\n\nif my NLS was quickly profitable with little movement, did i mess up by buying so close to expiry? was it simply overpaying on a premium ? when i started this i day traded some F option for 1 contract and i was up like 30% very quickly with minimal price movement. Im exploring and learning greeks to see if there is a component that made this trade such a bad one or rather, so hard to become profitiable while the others were profitable without even getting into the money so much.\n\nGood luck to everyone!",

        "selftext": "My brain just wrinkled thinking about the AMC situation.\nTell me if Im wrong.\n\n1. Voting yes means more shares, which means a count for actual viable shares, which is a good thing, right?\n2. Voting yes means share dilution, which in the immediate sense means a price drop, but can also act as a buying opportunity because fire sale.\n3. That fire sale could be bought up by current apes, new smoothbrains who couldn't afford to buy in until now, or by banks. Outcome unknown, but Im guessing apes will buy en masse.\n4. Increasing shares is a way for the company to build wealth, is it not? It just becomes a long terrm play for the real diamond-handers instead of a short-term play. \n5. So theoretically, if you vote Yes, you really like the stock and care about the company...and if you vote No, youre just worried about your bag right now, and not in the long term?\n6. If they do issue shares and you're holding, but buy more once the price drops, you could theoretically make up what you lost during dilution in the long term.\n7. Also, let's not kid ourselves, if they issue shares and price dilution happens, a lot of paperhanders will sell only to buy again after the price hits the dilution low, possibly creating another opportunity?\n\nNone of this is advice, I just like the company and the stock.",

[Link to DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mhcq0v/root_the_next_moon_landing/)\n\n1- It has a rare Short interest of 47.36% Float as of 03/31/2021(Fintel). In addition, only 75,000 are available for shorting(2021-04-01 11:33:46.728 UTC). To put things into perspective, If there's a short interest of %10, that's considered high. If there's a short interest of %20 or greater, **that's considered extremely high**. We have 47.36%!!! so a **short squeeze** is inevitable? \n\n **In comparison, as of 03/31/2021, $GME has a short interest of 18.81%, $AMC 17.31%!!! %ROOT is sitting on 47.36%(FINTEL).**\n\n2-  Forget about the short squeeze... It also has a potential of **gamma squeezing**. The open interest of calls is high above 15$ relative to Float. Once it hits and stays above $15, the **gamma squeeze** could take it to a whole **new solar system**. \n\n3- $ROOT is massively undervalued, **without factoring in the Gamma and Short squeeze potential(especially with low float and low valuation 3.2B reminds me of early days of $GME)**, at $LMND multiple **$ROOT would trade at $65** and if ROOT is successful in capturing 2% of the $266 billion US auto insurance market then just the insurance side is worth **10x(120$).**\n\nBUT... instead of doing Voodoo math, **there is no reason this stock is worth less than its IPO price of $27.**  This is at the cross hairs of disruptive technology that is too strong to ignore.\n\n4- For 2021 Growth Potential, There is an acceleration in ROOT daily and weekly app downloads which started in February based on a leading 3rdparty app data(App Annie)(Illustrated in the chart in u/faisall1's post).

[https://youtu.be/b1HrFGwPweA](https://youtu.be/b1HrFGwPweA)\n\n**DTC- 2021-005 Proposed Rule Change**\n\nFirst off, if you don\u2019t already know the Depository Trust Company (DTC) is one of the largest securities depositories in the world and also acts as a clearinghouse to process and settle trades in corporate and municipal securities. The DTC holds eligible securities on behalf of Participants and its activities include transfers and pledges of securities, and the settlement of transactions for Participants by book-entry, free of payment or delivery versus payment. Now that is cleared up so lets begin\u2026\n\nDTC-2021-005 proposes a modification of the DTC Settlement Guide and the DTC Pledgee\u2019s Agreement available here\u2026 [https://www.dtcc.com/legal/rules-and-procedures](https://www.dtcc.com/legal/rules-and-procedures) \n\nThis settlement guide along with all the other guides found on the DTC website put the DTC\u2019s rules and regulations into normal ape English as best they can to help understand what they mean and how they work.\n\nThe very first note of this specific guide states that:\n\n\u201cIt is the sole responsibility of **Participants** to perform a daily reconciliation of their activity and positions with the information, reports and statements provided by DTC. Participants must immediately report to DTC any discrepancy between their activity and positions with the information, reports and statements provided by DTC or other issues relating to the accuracy of the information, reports and statements provided by DTC\u201d \n\nParticipants are clearly the liable party here so let\u2019s first understand who they are before we dive any further. \n\nRule 1 of the DTC By-Laws tells us this: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dk010xma2ur61.png?width=618&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e08891f1c5ba3892efa57b07415ec27277ade10b\n\nPretty vague so let\u2019s go to Section 1 of Rule 2, but keep in mind that any time you see the word Corporation its mean the DTC:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jw3f9fsb2ur61.png?width=557&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65b5d8ae0cef8b1d7ba3c7d973653faccc5bb273\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aek47t9c2ur61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e901c46a381a56420c12d3ad7127869accbc8760\n\nSo essentially a DTC Participant can be brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations on whose behalf DTC was created to hold securities to facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions among DTC Participants.\n\n**Guess who is a DTC Participant?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rgngmbod2ur61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=551a75e0ad1719f602b0a6b8dd79952f459f868f\n\nIf you guessed Citadel, you would be right! Ok so let\u2019s look at the proposed change now\u2026\n\nAccording to the formal document submitted on April 1st, 2021, \u201cthe proposed rule change would revise text in the Settlement Guide and Pledgee\u2019s Agreement to clarify the text with respect to the processing of book entries of Pledge-related activity at DTC.\u201d Go here to read for yourself:\n\n[https://www.google.com/search?q=dtcc+rule+005&amp;rlz=1C1GCEB\\_enUS939US939&amp;oq=dtcc+rule+005&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.3432j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8](https://www.google.com/search?q=dtcc+rule+005&amp;rlz=1C1GCEB_enUS939US939&amp;oq=dtcc+rule+005&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.3432j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)\n\nAccording to Rule 1, the term \u201cPledge\u201d refers to \u201ccreating or providing for a security interest in a **certified or uncertified security**, a securities account, or securities entitlement in accordance with the NYUCC\u201d. The NYUCC being the Uniform Commercial Code of NY. A certified security is a security represented by certificate, which means an uncertified security has no certificate. Securities are banknotes, bonds, common stocks, options as well as many other forms. A securities account has two means, as follows: \n\n1) \u201cused with respect to a Participant or Pledgee, means an account maintained by DTC for the Participant or Pledgee to which Securities transactions of the Participant or Pledgee effected through the facilities of DTC are debited and credited in the manner specified in the Rules and Procedures\u201d \n\n2)\u201d used with respect to DTC, means an internal account of DTC to which Securities transactions are debited and credited to DTC.\u201d \n\nThe proposed revisions would reflect in the text of the Settlement Guide and Pledgee\u2019s Agreement that Pledged Securities remain credited to a Pledgor\u2019s Account unless the Pledgee makes a demand for the Pledged Securities. The respective texts of the Settlement Guide and the Pledgee\u2019s Agreement currently indicate that Pledged Securities are credited to a Pledgee\u2019s Account. The proposed rule change relates to a technical aspect of the operational processing of Pledge transactions and would not impact the rights or obligations of a Participant or Pledgee. \n\nEnglish, man, English!!!! Sorry, this means that the DTC or a pledgee approved by the DTC may demand a participant deliver the securities they pledged to deliver. This theoretically would eliminate FTDs, Failure-to-Delivers. \n\nYou\u2019re probably thinking, \u201cWait! I thought the other Rule change did this? Patience grasshopper, the best is yet to come!\n\nHere are the physical changes taking place in the Settlement Guide, which offers some icing to this cake: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tojo3wtf2ur61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c211e556be3491256730d2d7a3fba529e03681c\n\nTherefore, in the DTC\u2019s system all securities will remain accounted for at all times, which eliminates the possibility to naked short! This is what has been plaguing us in the market for as long as the market has existed. This of course has its pros and cons! The procon sandwich here is that because no more naked shorting will be able to take place, provided a loophole isn\u2019t quickly found, there will never been a squeeze like the ones we will see in the near future with the highly shorted stocks we know in love, Namely GME and AMC, just to name two! Therefore, is it unlikely we will take those HF managers Gucci ties and place them around our heads while we stand on top of the nearest tall object we can find and pound on our chests until we are badly bruised! However, maybe this will prevent the market from suffering severe crashes in the future, the purposeful bankrupting of companies, and the intense market manipulation we have seen of late.\n\nThe big potential con of course lies in the details of Rule 2 Section 2 &amp; 3: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jwrq0wfh2ur61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26ce0b7c5a50d27ba6c2bfecf70be08797023e14\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/clu3nyuh2ur61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ab1e3c6894b34d4ca7277c2da113d95bfea5b34\n\nHence, Citadel having the approval to be a DTC participant we two separate accounts as I mentioned previously could mean that Citadel A acts as a Pledgee for Citadel B the Participant and nothing changes except some words on a piece of paper. It seems like the DTC would still have the numbers in their system and not allow the pledged securities be repledged, but if that\u2019s not the case Citadel A may just lie and say, \u201cOh yea, they are alllllll accounted for!\u201d\n\nNevertheless, if this does pass remember Rule 27: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/addv67vi2ur61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b8453c57a55fca372fbb1c908ef1e8cebe659f7\n\nHere\u2019s to hoping all ends well for us Apes!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/em71yd1k2ur61.png?width=346&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1fb790977e173c4ceaf27926bbd5528534f9d621",

        "selftext": "For everyone who thinks all short-selling is bad, consider how strong the conviction must be for a fund to take an unhedged short position after GME and other squeezing bankrupted \"Smart Money.\" Strategies that involved using leverage to take on risk far greater than could be justified by any gains resulted in losses far above the threshold any reasonable asset manager should allow. There is a reason why taking short positions, has more than purely negative implications for the markets. Before you get mad, let me explain how it can actually can contribute to healthy markets. More importantly, I will talk about how limiting buy orders is far more destructive to shareholders.\n\nA company can take short positions in a number of ways. Many of which are new and now accessible to retail investors. Prior, high borrowing fees and barriers to entry made it only feasible for funds with with a significant AUM and open mandate. Now we have:\n\nInverse leveraged ETF's offering a low opportunity cost way of managing drawdowns and protecting investors with long positions during periods of large and lasting declines.\nIt can give retail investors a chance to make gains during a bear market. Rather than leaving only short sellers to profit, it can help contribute to the rebound and to the long term accumulation of wealth by new and small investors. These gains will likely be redistributed to those who need them the most or reallocated to sectors more deserving of capital based on the FREE MARKET.\n\nOptions, primarily buying puts allows for a set amount to be allocated to stocks or securities that could drop, but have a high chance of appreciating in value enough to offset the limited loss caused by the put expiring useless. Without any way of preventing rapid price declines from causing shareholders to sell more, and more, the innovation, new companies and higher risk plays would become impossible as the cost of margin (or clients with new money) required to stick it out prevents a buy and hold alternative.\n\nFor example, since I purchased Canadian and U.S. energy stocks during their lowest points: I have been able to hold those positions as they appreciate in value by almost 100% or more because I know that I can buy puts without costing much money as they expire and I repurchase OTM contracts at regular intervals to save my portfolio from a Blackswan event like 08 or increase my returns when an event like Covid-19. I may not have the 20X gains some investors have earned this year, but at least I know how much my loss could amount to if a meltdown occurs.\n\nThe F strategy is easy to follow and would have prevented situations like GME and many other times where funds blow up overnight. Forget shorting any of the:\n\nFrauds: If you are taking on a short position because you think a company is being fraudulent, you risk being right but still taking a big L because the company did something fraudulent, illegal or questionable to cover up the same reason to short in the first place. \"Fake it till you make it\" has been used by companies backed into a corner and forced to produce results or go under. We have seen banks and fortune 500 companies committing fraud or crimes because the penalties are negligible and the rewards are great.\n\nFailures: Shorting a failing company can and many times IS asking for trouble because changes in events, new information, technological breakthroughs and cheap debt can give the failing company a chance to pivot and very quickly reverse a trend even after it appears impossible. For example: AR is an energy company in the US that had to deal with low commodity prices, an oversupply of domestic and international crude as well as high borrowing costs. It had a 25+% short interest as it hovered around bankruptcy and dropped below a dollar per share during the worst of the pandemic. Rising oil prices then gas prices, and very low borrowing costs allowed for the struggling company to refinance, cut costs, face less competition and pay down high cost debt. No longer a failing company, many believed despite its massive free cashflow and huge reserves it will drop following a short lived rally thanks to a regime change and aggressive climate policies. Wrong. They shorted it up to $7, with 16% of the float still accumulating losses as of Jan 15.\n\nFads: My last F is particularly interesting right now because of the record levels of short interest in stocks like TSLA and AMC. During a period of intense buying and high rates of participation from the overall marketplace, the potential for price action driven by sentiment alone has never been higher. The time horizon and risk appetite for the AVERAGE investor (very different from a few years ago) combined with access to information faster, cheaper and easily manipulated information can lead to irrational (or rational depending on how you view it) price appreciation in companies that should otherwise have no reason to be rising. Disruptive technology, the FOMOGROMO effect (how I describe the fear of missing out on rapid growth perpetuated by rapid growth) and central banks changing their behaviours. The old saying \"The markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent is so relevant.\" Fads can also become the norm, and by assuming the vacuum created by the disappearance of a trend/fad will cause your short position to pay of and produce a quick gain: you will be surprised to see the emergence of structural changes cementing the fad into long-term patterns of behaviour initially thought to be impossible or very unlikely. For example, at the height of the pandemic, equities such as the IEF (a fixed income 10-year bond etf) rose to record highs as the flight to safety and market turmoil caused a massive demand for low risk, highly liquid fixed income ETFs. Further supported by the Fed buying assets like they are going out of style in fear of a deep recession following the lockdown. After the vaccine showed effectiveness and the economy began returning back to normal, I purchased a very small number of puts that would pay out substantially if nothing happened and more if the economy showed a strong recovery. This should be especially true with rising inflationary pressure. It was not a FAD, the Fed is apparently going to keep buying these assets until the M2 supply hits GME/TSLA levels. (Both two of the most shorted stocks return the highest gains this year.)",
