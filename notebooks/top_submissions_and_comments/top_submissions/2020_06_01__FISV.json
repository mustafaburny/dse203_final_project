        "selftext": "Welcome to another daily Unusual Options Activity post. Why do DD when you can see what stocks people are heavily investing in? The full post and a list of previous plays, as well as resources, are available at [https://www.noeticoptions.com/](https://www.noeticoptions.com/).\n\nContext \u2013 The S&amp;P 500 declined 2.4% today on fears of a CoVID-19 resurgence. Texas, California, and Arizona are the most notable hotspots.

At 12:22 32,015 18 DEC 20 100C were bought for $11. It\u2019s odd to see the stock decline despite being 13x it\u2019s ADV and have such a high C/P ratio for the day. Most of the calls were bought at the ask. The one major transaction is skewing this percentage a bit \u2013 I\u2019d imagine retail traders followed this and mostly traded at the mid. I will likely invest in this stock tomorrow.**\n\n2.  ***Ticker: CNX \u2013 Short Play***\n\n**Spot Price** **:8.96 -.24, (-2.61%)**\n\n**Sector: Energy**  **Industry : OIL &amp; Gas E&amp;P**\n\n**Company Summary** (from Yahoo Finance)**:** CNX Resources Corporation, an independent oil and gas company, explores for, develops, and produces natural gas properties primarily in the Appalachian Basin.

        "selftext": "If you look at the Ferguson riots in August 2014, police body camera companies did extremely well.  The overall market actually went up as well, so those of you buying SPY puts chose incorrectly.\n\nAAXN went from $12 to $27 from August to December.  \nDGLY went from $3 to $25 in a few days after the riots.\n\nOut of these two, I prefer AAXN because they are more established.  These are short-term positions for me - perfect for trading FDs.\n\nAnonymous group is hacking everything right now and there is definitely a push for tighter net security.\n\nFTNT has great revenue growth (20%/year).  Increasing EPS and more importantly, increasing free cash flow to equity.  No debt.    \nCRWD has phenomenal revenue growth (109%/year) but it is a pretty new company.  Their subscription model leads to very sticky revenues and one of the few companies that is actually growing faster than ZM.  They also release earnings tomorrow and if they can hit over $185m for the quarter, I can see them shooting up.\n\nThese two are both larger term holds for me.
