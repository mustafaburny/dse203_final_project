        "selftext": "The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type any given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare. **That is what happened here.**\n\nThe following research is quite advanced, look for the words **TL;DR** if your smoothness is over 9000.\n\n**TL;DR** Via machine learning analysis and scientific discovery, the formerly-hidden, hyper-subtle messages held within the GameStop online store have been decoded. **Short interest is at a minimum 700%**. The new **floor is $302,400,000**. Kenny is involved in the **UFO stories** we have been seeing on MSM.\n\nYOU ARE (start reading) HERE\n\nGameStop has had this information public for months, right under our noses. It only takes one ape to crack the code, and I have done it. It all started when I was staring at [GameStop.com](https://gamestop.com/) trying to figure out where they kept the crayons. I thought to myself, \"hmm, I wonder what would happen if I typed the half dozen words that I can spell into the search bar up top?\" Behold, my revelations.\n\n**Search bar term: SHORTS**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img p1w78utbdv071...*\n\nTwo results of note. The boxers are sold out, which is GameStop giving a nod to Atobitt's Citadel Has No Clothes DD (great read, linked below). Second, GameStop is the best so they are obviously have more copies of the NintendoDS game 'Shorts' but they are *mis-marking* it as sold out. This means that all shorts must cover and shares are behind rehypothecated. The last lead did not pan out, the Artemis Fowl connection led nowhere and just wasted seven hours of my time.\n\n([https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m4c0p4/citadel\\_has\\_no\\_clothes/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m4c0p4/citadel_has_no_clothes/))\n\nSearching for shorts did not reveal anything earth shattering, so I decided to take a meta approach. I searched for 'reddit' and began the descent into the rabbit hole that led to my ultimate discovery.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/by1d3t9fdv071.png?width=1713&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4757a00863e348d4eb669b913da35b47150278e\n\nAt first glance there does not appear to be anything important going on here, just a dragon ball-z figurine. I had never heard of Radditz before and was thinking he's probably like a knock-off Vegeta or something. I managed to get the imaginary boyfriend of my imaginary wife to type the words 'Radditz power level' into the google. I cannot read, but I liked what I heard from my text-to-speech app; the first result had a lot of numbers in it. **Numbers are closely related to financial markets.** I knew I was on to something. I clicked the link.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pnwu1m4idv071.png?width=1249&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7967b1b0cf5e48dfd9478085cf626e108b692f41\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt took a few hours, but I managed to throw my crayons at the keyboard in such a way that it searched for \"Rad\" on the very long page that would have taken weeks to read. Ok, I thought, I recognize these things from earlier this year: NUMBERS ONCE AGAIN. I am starting to see numbers everywhere, this is big.\n\nAccording to **many** of the top 10 counting songs on youtube: 3,000 is the highest number on this list. These numbers belong to two guys named Scarface and Shorty. Now at this point I thought that the next step in my research was to watch the movie, Scarface. So I did. But after I finished it I started thinking about the other result, Shorty.\n\nIt did not take me long (2 days and three more Al Pacino movies) to figure out that if you subtract the 'y' from 'Shorty' you get the word 'Short.' It was starting to make sense, GameStop planted this website knowing that Apes like numbers. They knew we would click on it, and see the word 'Shorty.'\n\nSo, back to GameStop.com I went, armed with the knowledge that the search term I was looking for was 'Shorty.'\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5slx341kdv071.png?width=1084&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4209d24d897eacc9911c927642b803696cc7382f\n\nThis is going to sound crazy, but it is definitely probably true: GameStop is indicating that the 'Klowns' behind the 'shorty'( - y + ing) are aliens from 'Outer Space' and that is why we have seen so much news about UFOs. At this point, the blatant corruption of MSM and sheer magnitude of this other-world fuckery started to make my head spin so I took a few minutes off from my GME pursuit. But after a quick bowl of banana raman I was ready and more determined than ever to get to the bottom of this mystery.\n\nIt is my understanding that apes are the key to this whole ordeal, so I took one last shot at the wealth of information hidden within GameStop's online store. I searched for patient zero, the alpha whale, the one who has been silently swimming aside GameStop for the past 33 years (plus or minus \\~32.5 years). I searched for 'Apes.'\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4mdooyvndv071.png?width=1497&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55271b59eca12983bffa8488f32e8b5d5df2f965\n\nHOLY SHIT. Confirmation biased confirmed.\n\nJust look at these numbers! Google says Great Ape Vegeta's power level is 180,000. There are two Great Ape Vegeta so we multiply by two and land on 360,000. The second Great Ape Vegeta also has a FiGPiN XL multiplier. This was the most difficult part to figure out, but after several months of deep thought and a machine learning application I was able to deduce that XL is a Roman Numeral and that Roman Numerals are old-timey numbers and that XL means a 40X multiplier. Great, so now we are at the number 14,400,000.\n\nBut it got even crazier.\n\nApe Escape..... 3!! As in another three times multiplier?! Yes, another one! We are at 43200000. But, wait, there is more! Look at the number of search results: 7. GameStop is basically screaming that the stock has been counterfeited at least 7 times over. The short interest is at least 700%. And that obviously means that we get another multiplier of 7x. The new floor is $302,400,000. This is retarded but probably true.\n\nDisclaimers:\n\n\\-I am long as fuck on GME. It is literally my savings account now.\n\n\\-If you think this is financial advice you may need to switch to non-toxic crayons.\n\n\\-This is my Magnum Opus shitpost. If even one person laughs, mission accomplished. Although.... I hope at least two people laugh because this legitimately took around 90 minutes to writeup. **So much respect for actual DD writers.**",

Also the good old payment for order flow PFOF system RH loves.\n\nMaking money and also using it to wash the empty fake trust bonds (sometimes partially empty), that\u2019s where the money is for him!!\n\nThey're not just shorting GME, they short tons of other companies as well. Those shorts need to seem legitimate and have real money backing them up (trust bond money) so no margin call happens if the SEC comes looking. Real money backing it so it\u2019s \u201cALL LEGAL AND LEGITIMATE\u201d\n\nYou know the drill! **Boom Money Washed!**\n\n**METHOD #2: Betting in the company knowing the result (manipulate the performance and outcome).**\n\nBet on the companies performance (not only short betting, but also making calls and manipulating it up and down)\n\nIt\u2019s easy to bet if you can manipulate the outcome right?\n\nNice casino Kenny! **Boom Money Washed!**\n\n**METHOD #3: Move the money overseas by funding overseas companies**\n\nFund companies overseas (together with other bank friends) and receive assets or Treasury bonds strips (T-bonds) as collateral (countries overseas have T-bonds to use as collateral for money) with interest rates of about 12%+!! **Boom Money Washed!**\n\nHe\u2019s making money on both sides of the trade, when giving the money he is making huge $$ in conversion exchange rates and fees, as well as when receiving the Collateral $$ for fees and exchange rates when it applies. **Boom!** ***this money is legitimate now!***\n\n[https://sec.report/Document/0001752724-21-087103/](https://sec.report/Document/0001752724-21-087103/)\n\n**METHOD 4: Scoop all the real state from bankrupted companies**\n\n[Scoop up all the real estate and assets](https://www.forbes.com/sites/amydobson/2019/09/19/billionaire-ken-griffin-adds-99-million-purchase-to-massive-real-estate-portfolio/amp/) that are left behind when the companies are bankrupt, buying the retail dirt cheap. **That\u2019s why Kenny targets brick and mortar, imagine GME stores closing and Kenny buying those properties for pennies.**\n\n**With real state the scam is even bigger!

Investors saw a bleak reminder of how risky some government bonds can be during the Asian financial crisis of 1997 and 1998. During this crisis, several Asian nations were forced to devalue their currency which sent reverberations around the globe. The crisis even caused Russia to default on its debt.\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/government-bond.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/government-bond.asp)\n\nAbout all this... Michael Burry has been warning us about a possible hyperinflation, all this will be **explained LATER ON!!**\n\nI'm going to break down each one of Kenny strategies as we go in the post.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**TRUST BONDS: The basket of bonds INFITINE MONEY GLITCH!!!**\n\nFirst of all let me stress how important this is!\n\n**THIS IS KENNY MAIN SOURCE OF CASH (LIQUIDITY)**, with this he's able to do all kinds of fuckery from shorting, to all the washing methods above (Ill explain more with sources as we move forward).\n\nThey love shorting because they love producing naked shares to fill up the juicy [**TRUST BONDS**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collateraltrustbond.asp#:~:text=A%20collateral%20trust%20bond%20is,pay%20the%20bondholder%2C%20if%20necessary) and get more and more cash for liquidity and fukery!!\n\nSo what's inside those **TRUST BONDS?**\n\n\"A collateral trust bond is a bond that is secured by a financial asset such as stock or other bonds\"\n\nWAIT WHAT???\n\nSo you telling me that Kenny is not only able to put his NAKED SHARES inside this basket called **TRUST BONDS** and pack it to sell, but that he can **PUT TRUST BONDS INSIDE OTHER TRUST BONDS?**\n\nThis is the pyramid and biggest **PONZI SCHEME!!!!**\n\nHear me out:\n\nThey have been **shorting many businesses** and also **buying some long positions in many other** businesses (I read somewhere and I cant find the source that Citadel controls 26% (according to the senate in the hearing) of the market).

While making a shit ton of money from NON EXISTING SHARES PACKED IN BIG BAGS OF SHIT!\n\n\\---------------------------------------\n\n**BIG BANKS ARE \u201cHOLDINGS\u201d???? WHAT IS THAT?**\n\nFirst we need to learn [what is a holding company?](https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/expert-insights/using-a-holding-company-operating-company-structure-to-help-mitigate-risk) [Restaurant Brands International (RBI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant_Brands_International) is an example of a holding company for a group of popular Quick Service (Fast Food) restaurants. They own Burger King, Tim Horton's and Popeyes. In this case RBI holding is basically a basket of a few fast food restaurants put together, like a stock ETF. It is the basket of those businesses and the value is according to those companies performance.\n\nSo are banks holding companies? Well...\n\n**As a result of the global financial crisis of 2008, many traditional investment banks and finance corporations such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, American Express, CIT Group and GMAC (now Ally Financial) converted to bank holding companies in order to gain access to the Federal Reserve's credit facilities. (**[Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_holding_company))\n\nThese holdings are filled up by pieces of many private institutions they lent money to: businesses, hedge funds, as well as people they lent money to (mortgages, auto loans, student loans, etc., plus money they lent to the government. Obviously as well as the money the people deposit and keep in their bank account (it will be their liquidity if they don't use your money, most of the time they move your money.)\n\n**Keep in mind: The federal reserve is privately owned (not part of the government and instead is sanctioned and backed by it) by the 12 reserve banks and the 0.01% (THE BIG BIG WHALES) (they are the top contributors to the reserve).** [Federal Reserve Structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_the_Federal_Reserve_System) WHAAAAAT?\n\nBut lets keep going with the banks...\n\nThink about every company borrowing money from a bank and putting their assets as collateral (putting that stock collateral inside the bank's basket/pool, mainly ETFs).\n\nNow the bank owns part of the company in form of debt collateral. The bigger the company debt the bigger part of the pie the bank owns as collateral, right? Big leverage!\n\nAlso, some ETFs are pretty much a basket/pool full of many many company shares that are supposed to be the collateral for the debts. Some others are filled with as packages of people\u2019s debt (student loans, mortgages, etc). Others full of government debt to the banks.\n\nPut all those shares and pieces of the company (could be turned into liquidity if sold in case of company liquidation or too much risk) and their liquidity backing of cash (people\u2019s bank accounts deposited) together and that\u2019s what the bank is made of. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong on the comments please. The banks own leverage on those companies they lend money too.\n\nTake a break!! I know this is very intense, but with every word I can see your hands getting harder and harder after knowing WTF is going on!\n\n**Ohhh Kenny, how the fuck did a melon discover your fuckery?**\n\n**PLEASE DONT FORGET TO UPVOTE EVERY POST AND COMMENT!!

I was wondering if they are still having these problems, and if so are there any other brokerages that you can trade crypto on without actually having to own it (no private keys). I read Robinhood is also commission free on crypto which also has me interested. It also seems like the only non-crypto brokerage that allows trading of cryptos, granted you don\u2019t actually own them on there.\n\nThanks for any advice or suggestions on this!",

        "selftext": "The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type any given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare. **That is what happened here.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe following research is quite advanced, look for the words **TL;DR** if your smoothness is over 9000. \n\n**TL;DR** Via machine learning analysis and scientific discovery, the formerly-hidden, hyper-subtle messages held within the GameStop online store have been decoded.  **Short interest is at a minimum 700%**. The new **floor is $302,400,000**. Kenny is involved in the **UFO stories** we have been seeing on MSM. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# YOU ARE (start reading) HERE\n\nGameStop has had this information public for months,  right under our noses. It only takes one ape to crack the code, and I have done it.  It all started when I was staring at [GameStop.com](https://GameStop.com) trying to figure out where they kept the crayons. I thought to myself, \"hmm, I wonder what would happen if I typed the half dozen words that I can spell into the search bar up top?\" Behold, my revelations.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Search bar term: SHORTS** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yh43rbxr7t071.png?width=1767&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2eede91ff30d0ad86864d14f1ab2610c1c78e408\n\nTwo results of note. The boxers are sold out, which is GameStop giving a nod to Atobitt's Citadel Has No Clothes DD (great read, linked below). Second, GameStop is the best so they are obviously have more copies of the NintendoDS game 'Shorts' but they are *mis-marking* it as sold out. This means that all shorts must cover and shares are behind rehypothecated. The last lead did not pan out, the Artemis Fowl connection led nowhere and just wasted seven hours of my time. \n\n([https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m4c0p4/citadel\\_has\\_no\\_clothes/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m4c0p4/citadel_has_no_clothes/)) \n\nSearching for shorts did not reveal anything earth shattering, so I decided to take a meta approach. I searched for 'reddit' and began the descent into the rabbit hole that led to my ultimate discovery. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7m1jrga86t071.png?width=1713&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab0f60e2db84059cfb4c53ab5eccb80ca6d37520\n\nAt first glance there does not appear to be anything important going on here, just a dragon ball-z figurine. I had never heard of Radditz before and was thinking he's probably like a knock-off Vegeta or something. I managed to get the imaginary boyfriend of my imaginary wife to type the words 'Radditz power level' into the google. I cannot read, but I liked what I heard from my text-to-speech app; the first result had a lot of numbers in it. **Numbers are closely related to financial markets.** I knew I was on to something. I clicked the link.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kwipe7fq9t071.png?width=1249&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf81740aafddc3a64309e18293c947d00448663a\n\nIt took a few hours, but I managed to throw my crayons at the keyboard in such a way that it searched for \"Rad\" on the very long page that would have taken weeks to read. Ok, I thought, I recognize these things from earlier this year: NUMBERS ONCE AGAIN. I am starting to see numbers everywhere, this is big. \n\nAccording to **many** of the top 10 counting songs on youtube: 3,000 is the highest number on this list. These numbers belong to two guys named Scarface and Shorty. Now at this point I thought that the next step in my research was to watch the movie, Scarface. So I did. But after I finished it I started thinking about the other result, Shorty. \n\nIt did not take me long (2 days and three more Al Pacino movies) to figure out that if you subtract the 'y' from 'Shorty' you get the word 'Short.' It was starting to make sense, GameStop planted this website knowing that Apes like numbers. They knew we would click on it, and see the word 'Shorty.'\n\nSo, back to GameStop.com I went, armed with the knowledge that the search term I was looking for was 'Shorty.'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/stid7hqhbt071.png?width=1084&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8652fefcd16037d60e7189f19f561bcb51fcd42e\n\nThis is going to sound crazy, but it is probably true: GameStop is indicating that the 'Klowns' behind the 'shorty'( - y + ing) are aliens from 'Outer Space' and that is why we have seen so much news about UFOs. At this point, the blatant corruption of MSM and sheer magnitude of this other-world fuckery started to make my head spin so I took a few minutes off from my GME pursuit. But after a quick bowl of banana raman I was ready and more determined than ever to get to the bottom of this mystery. \n\nIt is my understanding that apes are the key to this whole ordeal, so I took one last shot at the wealth of information hidden within GameStop's online store. I searched for patient zero, the alpha whale, the one who has been silently swimming aside GameStop for the past 33 years (plus or minus \\~32.5 years). I searched for 'Apes.'\n\n*Processing img trw4rdexet071...*\n\nHOLY SHIT. Confirmation biased confirmed.\n\nJust look at these numbers! Google says Great Ape Vegeta's power level is 180,000. There are two Great Ape Vegeta so we multiply by two and land on 360,000. The second Great Ape Vegeta also has a FiGPiN XL multiplier. This was the most difficult part to figure out, but after several months of deep thought and a machine learning application I was able to deduce that XL is a Roman Numeral and that Roman Numerals are old-timey numbers and that XL means a 40X multiplier. Great, so now we are at the number 14,400,000. \n\nBut it got even crazier. \n\nApe Escape..... 3!! As in another three times multiplier?! Yes, another one! We are at 43200000. But, wait, there is more! Look at the number of search results: 7. GameStop is basically screaming that the stock has been counterfeited at least 7 times over. The short interest is at least 700%. And that obviously means that we get another multiplier of 7x. The new floor is $302,400,000. This is retarded but probably true. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclaimers:  \n\n\\-I am long as fuck on GME. It is literally my savings account now. \n\n\\-If you think this is financial advice you may need to switch to non-toxic crayons.\n\n\\-This is a joke. If even one person laughs, mission accomplished. Although.... I hope at least two people laugh because this legitimately took around 90 minutes to writeup. **So much respect for actual DD writers.**",

        "selftext": "\nI assure you, this ISN'T going to get political. Because by all accounts South Africa is screwed. My planned position is bottom paragraph.\nUnder the current ANC government there has been a general degeneration of all aspects of South Africa. Due to systemic nepotism, there are math teachers that don't know what square roots are, army officers that can't read, and cops that have never fired a gun. The practice of fictitious employees that take checks but don't work there is widespread enough that the government has drove itself into insolvency already. Estimates are that some 80% of government funds are misused in some way, ranging from government subsidies given to businesses owned by government officials to simply going missing from accounts. The ANC solved this, against advise of wiser people, with quantitative easing. Which is a fancy term for printing money, and since they could never possibly reverse that printer they're inflating the South African Rand which is why they've had two bouts of inflation near 9% twice in the past 20 years.\nThat is all besides how the largely defunct government doesn't prevent anything on the ground. Roaming bands of pirates (many affiliates of the Marxist Economic Freedom Fighter party) will poison guard dogs and torture and murder residents often for as little as car keys and groceries. Many communities are functionally independent and take the law in their own hands, and in many areas utilities are defunct (untreated sewage goes in the river, untreated tap water comes out and it smells as disgusting as it sounds). South Africans are more likely to have their asylum applications accepted than any other nation as there are so many tales of rape and murder and threats of ethnic cleansing. This equates to the most educated citizens leaving SA and most SA based businesses diversifying out of the country as literacy rates have been falling. These disillusioned departures are not new, as they include the most famous Afrikaner in history Elon Musk who is now a naturalized American.\nEdit: The Economic Freedom Fighter's usual acronym isn't used because it's also the ticker for a penny stock.\nI first thought about shorting South Africa over a year ago when I was researching the country (I'm a historian, I read much on the country for fun). I found the only index tracking SA (EZA) wasn't an accurate representation of SA economy and buying puts on it was useless. It tracked only the largest cap firms, which are the aforementioned companies diversifying out of SA (mostly to other parts of Africa). Which is why it's a volatile ETF that overall trades sideways. Buying puts on it wouldn't really capitalize on SA going full Rhodesia/Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe having experienced the general breakup of modern institutions and hyperinflation due to similar problems.\nMy new broker, IBKR, allows negative currency positions as long you post 10% as collateral. Now my native currency are US dollars, where inflation in 2020 was 1.4% while the South African Rand's inflation was 4.12% in 2020. That equals a 26.8% return on investment per year from that simple short position. But I'm expecting US Dollar inflation to stay between 1-2% a year while the Rand (ticker ZAR) stays north of 4% with inflation spikes inevitable over the next decade. This position also reduces my market beta, much needed for me as I've got hugely leveraged positions on American ETFs. This isn't a short term swing trade, I'm waiting for SA to implode.",

Everything I read about this company indicates its a potential multibagger.\n\nMy analysis:\n\nGRAMF is a cannabis holding company focusing on recreational cannabis products. Currently it consists of two lines: Caliva, a delivery-based recreational cannabis company, and Monogram, a luxury cannabis brand. \n\nCurrently GRAMF trades at $6.00 and 96mio shares outstanding for a market cap of $575m.\n\nGRAMFs market cap of $575m is tiny compared to most of the well-known cannabis stocks which are all 1bio+. It has huge room for upside growth.\n\nGRAMF currently holds close to $300m just in cash. Compared to its $575m market cap, this implies GRAMF has a floor price of\u00a0 $3.26 JUST based on cash alone!\n\nMARKET SHARE\n\nThe cannabis market is currently particularly fragmented without any clear brand winner. For example, in california the top 10 cannabis brands only make up 30% total sales in the region. GRAMF has a good chance to emerge as a leader in this field for two reasons.\n\n1. Star Power: GRAMF is partnered with Jay-Z and his company Roc Nation (With artists like Rihanna, Meek Mill, Alicia Keys, et al). This is a huge outlet for cheap mass marketing, celebrity endorsements, and promotion. This will cement GRAMF as a brand in consumers\u2019 minds.\n\n2. M&amp;A: GRAMF management indicates it plans to use its huge cash war chest to aggressively acquire competitors. These M&amp;A deals will consolidate its foothold in the cannabis field and M&amp;A news will also help spike GRAMF share price.\n\nGROWTH\n\nRecreational cannabis was just legalized in march 2021 in NY. This is a huge untapped market which GRAMF has indicated is a focus of expansion. With Jay-Z and his east coast reputation at the helm, GRAMF has a huge chance to become a brand name in the region. \n\nFederal legalization in 2021/2022 is a also potential catalyst for the cannabis sector as a whole. Cannabis legislation by all indications looks to be favorable under the current Biden administration and has bipartisan support. GRAMF is currently only traded OTC because current regulations do not allow cannabis stocks to be listed on exchanges. Once regulation reform comes and GRAMF gets listed, this will drive share prices up.\n\nGRAMF has come off from its initial price of ~$11 when it first deSPAC\u2019ed to around $6 currently due to weak Q1 revenues and margins and its relative quietness currently. Its now trading quite cheaply compared to other cannabis stocks out there, and if it can post better Q2 numbers, make a splash in M&amp;A, and builds up its general brand recognition, expect the share price to skyrocket.",

My wife has left me and has taken my precious son with her. He is a beautiful 1 year old chihuhua.\nTo put this in context, I was left without a job with the beginning of the COVID pandemic, then I got infected and I acquired a large debt with the hospital for the recovery and time that I remained hospitalized.\nwe had a few savings left that we used to survive until a being who called himself my friend told me about cryptocurrencies. I studied a little and I thought that I could earn some money with it. I was wrong. They cheated me and what little was left was taken by him and my wife.\nAfter I left the hospital I adopted my beautiful baby and it was my strength to carry on with all the bad that has been from then until now that she took him away from me.\nHe won't give it back to me until I find a place to live and have space for my baby to grow up happily and feed him. I know it's fair but I can't take it anymore without him.\nThat is why I ask for your help. I know my story sounds unbelievable and for the same reason I apologize if I offend you.\nIf someone wants to help me get some money back and with that pay something to have space and get my son back, I appreciate it to the heavens.\n\nI have created a wallet in metamas because the keys of the one I used with my wife she took.\nif someone wants to help with even a penny I will be happy. I'll be a penny closer to my beautiful prince.\n0x9096Fbc32E532b0b3D3B3A132cfC89A37c115e85\n\nThank you all for reading to the end.",

While making a shit ton of money from NON EXISTING SHARES PACKED IN BIG BAGS OF SHIT!\n\n\\---------------------------------------\n\n**BIG BANKS ARE \u201cHOLDINGS\u201d???? WHAT IS THAT?**\n\nFirst we need to learn [what is a holding company?](https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/expert-insights/using-a-holding-company-operating-company-structure-to-help-mitigate-risk) [Restaurant Brands International (RBI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant_Brands_International) is an example of a holding company for a group of popular Quick Service (Fast Food) restaurants. They own Burger King, Tim Horton's and Popeyes. In this case RBI holding is basically a basket of a few fast food restaurants put together, like a stock ETF. It is the basket of those businesses and the value is according to those companies performance.\n\nSo are banks holding companies? Well...\n\n**As a result of the global financial crisis of 2008, many traditional investment banks and finance corporations such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, American Express, CIT Group and GMAC (now Ally Financial) converted to bank holding companies in order to gain access to the Federal Reserve's credit facilities.

        "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nI have been a long time and poster on this subreddit through some other account names, but wanted to make a more official account in order to share my ideas. \n\nI wanted to share with you guys a very basic SPAC trading strategy that I have been working on over the past few months. After developing it a bit further, I will be coming out with another blog post to cover the improvements that I have made to my trading model. \n\n[https://gainsandgrowth.wordpress.com/2021/04/18/spacs-a-trading-strategy/](https://gainsandgrowth.wordpress.com/2021/04/18/spacs-a-trading-strategy/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasics of the strategy:\n\n **1. SPACS offer a unique investment opportunity due to the \u201cprice floor\u201d** \n\n **2. SPACs tend to stay at or around the floor price until news surrounding the potential acquisition of a target is disseminated to the public** \n\n **3. SPACs will inevitably correct to the terms of the merger once they are announced** \n\nSo there are three keys points in this trading strategy\n\n1. **Identifying when investors \u201cnotice\u201d this stock.** If you can get in when investors notice the stock, you can ride the wave with them while avoiding the period of stagnation prior to major price movements.\n2. **Taking your gains and running.** I cannot stress this component of the strategy enough. We are not investing for the long term on this strategy, we don\u2019t even know anything about the company yet! We take our gains when we have them, and we revaluate if there is another point that is suitable for entry later down the road.\n3. **Reducing loses on \u201cFalse Positives\u201d.** If we enter into a position, we want to have clear end points for when we leave that position. Sometimes there will be false positives where we enter in the position, and no price action occurs, or the price of the SPAC falls. We want to get out quickly in these scenarios, since we are focusing on being ready to enter when the stock shoots up.\n\n**VOLUME**\n\nAs mentioned previously, the indicator is abnormal volume. This frees up the investor from monitoring news media and announcements, and focusing solely on the resulting interest in the company. What I have identified as a strong indicator of immediate upward price movements is three days of sustained volume above 200% of the monthly average volume.\n\nThis eliminates random trading days where the trading volume is high for unknown reasons. Maybe a fund is entering the SPAC and has bought a significant number of shares, who knows! We don\u2019t like just one day increases in volume because that can be anomaly. Three days of sustained large volume has appeared by the right indicator, but can of course be refined further. This is what I call the \u201cBuy Counter\u201d.\n\n**TAKING GAINS**\n\nThe second key part of this strategy is taking your gains. I have set an upward limit on price movement for 10%. After 10%, my algorithm will take its gains and exit the position, and will continue to monitor the SPAC and look for indicators to re-enter. The idea behind this being that a 10% return is an amazing return for any investor, especially over a short time frame. If we can string together many of these 10% returns, then I would be more than happy with the performance of my portfolio. This number is obviously arbitrary, and would benefit from more statistical analysis, but for the purposes of my initial tests I deemed it a fine starting point.\n\n**LIMITING FALSE POSITIVES**\n\nThe third key part of this strategy is reducing the times that you enter into a stock when the stock does not behave as expected. I also realized that towards middle/end of a SPACs lifecycle, volume indicators may also be true for major price corrections (refer to the CCIV graph and look at the volume towards the end of February). Therefore I also included a condition that the price increases over that 3 day period to avoid buying in on a fire sale.\n\n**Results:**\n\nI tested this strategy against 73 different SPACs, with $1000 to trade on these names from August 1st 2020 to April 18th 2021, and achieved a 20.5% return across the entire universe in my self built testing environment.\n\nParticularly impressive results were:\n\n1. TPGY: 203%\n2. ACTC 103%\n3. CCIV: 93%\n4. NGA 53%\n5. GHVI: 50%",

        "selftext": "For most people CumRocket seems like a funny memecoin, however for those who see it\u2019s potential it could revolutionise the porn industry. Here are some complied reasons as to why CumRocket is a solid investment right now. Obligatory this is not financial advice.  \n\nThe token unlike most meme coins actually has an real world use and an expanding economy. Right now it\u2019s used to buy nudes (that the models themselves are selling) and tip cam girls on NFT sites. But they are going to actually expand and either take on or combine with the porn industry.  \n\nHere are a few examples of how that might work:  \n\nScenario 1: They combine with the Porn industry and become the standard blockchain of choice for premium porn sites and other NSFW sites like OnlyFans. By having an alternative anonymous way to purchase subscriptions and porn, this allows many more people to engage monetarily with the porn industry. Right now millions of horney men and women are unable to access the content they want due to shared bank accounts and snooping partners. CumRocket offers the solution through anonymous payments.  \n\nScenario 2: they take on the porn industry by creating their own sites. They have already blackboarded this and are willing to offer 5% more than any other platform to creators while also offering complete anonymity for both the creator and buyer. Models would be paid and tipped in $CUMMIES.  \n\nThere is also a NFT marketplace where creators can sell their content. Buyers would have said content stored in their wallet, removing the need to store the content manually on a pc or hard drive. In other words the only way someone could access their porn is if they had their wallet keys.  \n\nFor many people around the world who are either embarrassed for creating porn or persecuted for it, CumRocket is the answer. In Australia where it\u2019s legal to be a sex worker they still struggle with mortgages due to the nature of the job. CumRockets allows them to show profits as an investment instead of sex.  \n\nNo matter which way $CUMMIES goes it cannot lose, they have already a growing list of content creators signing up and it\u2019s only a matter of time until one of the scenarios comes into fruition.  \n\nAudits have been done and passed, exchanges are interested, the token is deflationary with a small starting supply. It might have started as a meme but it won\u2019t end in one.",

        "selftext": "I'm a long term CLOV investor and do not believe the recent price action reflects a squeeze of any kind. More likely that wall street investors woke up to CLOV potential because of [this](https://innovation.cms.gov/media/document/gpdc-model-participant-announcement) CMS update that announces CLOV participation in 10 US states in PY 2021. (This is my first reddit post so here goes)\n\nBelow is why I (a regular, retail investor) have held on to CLOV shares and warrants in my portfolio and why I believe getting in on this stock under $15 is a no brainer (disclaimer: I\u2019m not a financial advisor and this is NOT investment advice, do your own DD before investing):\n\n1. **Business Model:** Clover Health is a Medicare Advantage insurance company. [Sources of revenue for MA insurers](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-is-medicare-advantage-funded) include premiums and payments via CMS, most of which goes to hospitals and doctors. In MA, specially under plans offered by CLOV, premiums are negligible so for our purpose payments made by CMS (government) are the lifeblood of MA plans such as Clover. You may be wondering so what? Well, let\u2019s put things in perspective. The US federal govt spent $1.2 Trillion on healthcare in 2019, $644 Billion of this went to Medicare of which $270B was spent on MA. All or most of this growing annual budget goes to fund MA plans such as Clover for services they provide members. The problem is, there are too many visits and hospitalizations (than are needed). What if there was an innovative startup that used innovation (pay doctors fixed fees per visit) and technology (Clover Assistant software with telehealth features) such that federal government paid out LESS per member to such a company vs. competition ([target outcome of Direct Contracting](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/direct-contracting)) for HIGHER quality of care. Great ability to capture market share from legacy insurers and help lower government spending (more on this later) \u2013 a WIN-WIN situation for insurer and the govt. This is why Clover\u2019s business model is so fool proof!  \n***TLDR:*** ***Clover operates in a space that is majority funded by government, and its unique business model helps it gain market share***\n2. **Competition:** Now let\u2019s talk competition. Competitors such as Humana, United Health, CVS/Aetna have for years delivered medical insurance but hardly innovated in a way that was positive for federal spending. They continued charging seniors on plan premiums, while trying to receive as much funding as possible from the fed to grow their profits. Why make the process more efficient when all we do to get paid is to broker insurance plans in a highly regulated industry. Clover with its innovation is miles ahead of the competition by getting a nice head start (started in 2014, while other [insurers are just getting started with the innovation)](https://medcitynews.com/2021/02/mercy-humana-partner-to-expand-access-to-virtual-value-based-care/) and the Clover Assistant software will constantly help it become more efficient i.e. achieve better results for its members, at a lower cost to CMS!! CLOV is also MORE HOLISTIC than TDOC in services, while targeting a LOWER TAM i.e. only Seniors right now. Only a matter of time that they expand beyond MA and offer plans for the general population.  \n***TLDR: Clover is disrupting competition through its use of technology.***\n3. **Software:** Now the bit about software. This IS Clover\u2019s secret ingredient. The development is led by an ex-Googler (Andrew Toy, President at Clover Health) to radically transform software used to treat seniors through massive digitization, and interactive UI. This in turn helps doctors improve outcomes for patients. And they are giving it away for free!!! Why would a physician not use software that helped him/her improve the standard of care for their patients while being easy to use and access and FREE. Imagine, Marc Benioff giving away Salesforce for free to sales reps all over. When this software becomes the standard of care because of the years of head start they have in this space, Clover Health could eventually license this to the other insurers and health care providers i.e. additional sources of revenue.  \n***TLDR: The Clover Assistant software is the secret ingredient that helps the company deliver efficient care and achieve better outcomes.***\n4. **Growth:** Ok so we briefly spoke about licensing as an additional mode of revenue, now let\u2019s focus on others. 2) Current projections indicate 14% annual organic growth of MA population, this growth is likely to go bonkers when Biden reduces the Medicare eligible age to 60, as [promised](https://joebiden.com/fact-sheet-how-joe-biden-would-help-you-get-health-insurance-coverage-during-the-coronavirus-crisis/) in his campaign. Evergreen and ever-growing TAM 3) Direct Contracting introduced by CMS is basically a risk sharing model that incentivizes insurers to make treatment of seniors more efficient and cost effective. Insurers that can achieve a lower cost of treatment and fewer hospital visits for the same condition, they are likely to be held in favor by CMS when allotting MA counties every year. Now, if you remember the bit about software, Clover is in the best position to do this\u2026as long as doctors continue to use the Clover Assistant software to treat seniors. This may sound like a risky bet, but it really isn\u2019t\u2026.60%+ of Clover members see a PCP that uses the Clover Assistant software. Clover\u2019s [long-term goal](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/static-files/ed2bc09d-cd96-4759-897e-862c2b250213) is to get to a 70%+ rate. 4) End 2020, Clover offered MA plans in 34 counties but this will grow based on participation in more states as per the [CMS Direct Contracting plan for 2021](https://innovation.cms.gov/media/document/gpdc-model-participant-announcement).  \n***TLDR: Growth in MA membership, direct contracting, geographic expansion, potential to license its software are all lucrative growth avenues.***\n5. **Customers:** Let\u2019s now put some light on the target demographic\u2026seniors. Clover is promising them the lowest cost plans ($0 premiums, low/no co-pays) which are highly flexible (telehealth on Clover Assistant) to their needs. Why not? In addition, Clover is developing partnerships with Walmart and other retailers to market their plans which is likely to result in an ever-growing customer and incentivized partner base.\n6. **Media:** The media has lambasted this company quite vocally including on CNBC despite little of substance\u2026except that there was a short-seller report and questions asked about the CEO. To his credit, Cramer recently invited Clover Health to Mad Money\u2026now, when this interview happens it is likely to introduce the company to a pretty massive list of retail investors (the buy and hold kind) and when they realize how undervalued Clover is, they will likely pick up a good portion of the float, causing fewer and fewer shares to be available.\n7. **Management:** If one reads through the exec incentive structure in [SPAC prospectus](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000119312520316032/d69158d424b3.htm#toc69158_24), they would soon realize that the CEO has most of his interest in the company tied to the stock \u2013 he does not receive a salary. More importantly, both CEO and President performance-based incentive plans do not kick in until CLOV reaches and maintains a volume weighted average price of $30 for a 90-day period. Consider also, **Lee Shapiro who sits on the board of Clover Health is the former CFO of Livongo (now part of TDOC, ARK fav) while Chelsea Clinton adds serious weight and is actively involved as a board member.**\n8. **Valuation:** SPAC merger docs value the company at $3.7B. Currently, because of the short seller report and the massive short-interest in the company, it is valued at \\~$3B, which is \\~4x 2021E sales. With projected revenues for 2021 of $835M (mid-point), and applying a 8x sales multiple, Clover\u2019s valuation needs to be at least $6.7B+ market cap implying a $16+ PT. With expected 24%+ growth in 2021, and premium multiple for high growth companies (note that the float is only 25% of shares outstanding), I believe a $20-25 target is more in line with current valuations. When medicare eligible age limit is lowered to 60 by Biden later this year or perhaps early next, this PT will need to be re-evaluated\u2026upward. Also consider the fact that this company is NOT zero revenue now, promising billions in 2025 and beyond\u2026.it had sales of $670M in sales in 2020 and growing!! Consider also that the industry-leader in the telehealth space \u2013 TDOC \u2013 and a Cathie Wood &amp; ARK fav currently trades at 16x sales. Similar multiple for CLOV implies a $33 PT.  \n***TLDR: Whichever way you cut it, CLOV is very undervalued right now. Near term $25-30 PT and longer term has LMND-like potential in healthcare insurance***\n\nI am long CLOV because I believe that it is trying to solve a very hard and complex problem in healthcare. It deserves a lot more credit and people rooting for it to succeed.",

        "selftext": "Buffett warned newbie investors that picking great companies is more complicated than just selecting a promising industry.\n\n\"There's a lot more to picking stocks than figuring out what's going to be a wonderful industry in the future,\" said Buffett.\n\nBuffett put up a slide of all the auto companies from years go that started with the letter \"M;\" however, the list was so long it didn't fit on one slide. The \"Oracle of Omaha\" had to narrow the list to automobile manufactures that started with \"Ma\" to fit the names on one page.\n\nBuffett said there were about 2,000 companies that entered the auto business in the 1900's because investors and entrepreneurs expected the industry to have an amazing future. In 2009, there were three automakers left and two went bankrupt, said Buffett.\n\nWhether it\u2019s technology, EVs, renewables, marijuana or cyber security, many will enter these budding industries, and most will not make it. It isn\u2019t good enough to pick the sector or industry that\u2019ll grow most, you either need to time your exits perfectly, or hope you have the few that survive to cover your losses on the many that don\u2019t.",

The plays are to be brought on market open ( within the 1st 2 minutes of the market opening). It will require limit order of the previous close , don\u2019t worry as your order would be fill at the Theoretical Option price at the open. \n\n1. Ma - 210507- Call- 382 strike price - The PUT prices are so high it caused the Mm to buy a shit ton of shares to drive the prices of the put down on Friday . The puts @ the current moment are still high, will led to the Option Mm to buy the stock up to cause the puts prices to drop while making the calls option in increase. The call option  is way below the deviation of the price. \n\n2.  Swks - 210507 - Call- 182.5 strike price. Price is currently Out of the deviation chart  and similar to MA, the puts are far too high. This one would force the put sellers and option Mm to buy up the stock to increases the price action.",

        "selftext": "This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!\n\n**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tymisf4seiw61.png?width=623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1aa1cef4c9a92f4863d89db376e4b86acf9380c9\n\n Microvision has overtaken GME to become the most discussed stock. This is the first time since Jan\u201921 that any stock has overtaken GME in the number of mentions (Not even the $100B Coinbase IPO could do it). Clover health has fallen from 3rd position last week to 7th this week. Coinbase also dropped out of the top 10 and is now in the 12th position. All the others are the usual stocks in the top 10 list except for Microsoft. They booked their biggest revenue growth since 2018 but down 3%+ after hours. \n\n **Top Growing Stocks of the Week** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/obttnaoueiw61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8e0b1a918c030d69646aa7f4915def8c13f1007\n\n Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.\n\n**MicroVision ($MVIS)** has been trending for the last two weeks. To say that the stock had a wild ride for the last 2 weeks would be an understatement. The stock went from having less than 500 mentions to more than 15,000 mentions in the last 2 weeks. The sentiment has also been affected by the recent drop going from 24% last week to 15% this week.\n\n**Globalstar ($GSAT)** is a Mobile satellite service company incorporating themselves into many new areas. GSAT was up 50% on Monday causing the spike in chatter. There has been a lot of discussion on the company trading at a value less than what their satellites currently in orbit are worth.\n\n**Nokia($NOK)** has beaten all expectations in earnings report and the stock jumped 11%. Their net profit increased more than 11-fold to 375 million euros ($455 million) which was well above analysts' estimates for adjusted profit of 90 million euros. The extremely bullish outlook is also reflected in the sentiment figures.\n\n**Ocugen($OCGN)** was trending mainly due to their partnership with an Indian firm \u2013 Bharat Biotech which produces Covaxin. The vaccine was found to neutralize a new type of Covid-19 variant and Dr. Fauci has said that this might be very important against the current pandemic. Ocugen is planning to bring this COVID-19 vaccine to the US, pending FDA authorization.\n\n**Amazon($AMZN)** was generating discussions due to its pending earnings report. There was a lot of speculative talk about a stock split. But they delivered beats on overall revenue and AWS revenue and far exceeded EPS estimate for Q1 2021.\n\n**SOME FAQ\u2019s:**\n\nHow does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).\n\nCan I use the code/is it open source: Yes.\n\nWhat is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments.\n\nThank you for reading!\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.*",

        "selftext": "\nBackstory - Got into investing at the start of the year. Rode the gamestop train and was immensly annoyed at the manipulation taking place on it. Got out for a \u00a35k profit.\n\nGot back on the gamestop train and am sitting at a \u00a3200 loss.\n\nGot onto the meme train of a certain stock running this week that deals with Lidar tech. Had 5k profit, was too greedy, got tied up and couldnt check my profile, ended up with a 2k loss.\n\nI really struggle with taking profits. It's probably greed. This is the biggest part of my investing life that I need to work on. I always think \"hmmm 20% profit, thats good, but 25% is better\". This mindset screws me every time, to the point I end up taking a loss, or taking a tiny profit because I held on and lost the big profit.\n\nOn the back of this week, I threw a yolo at Amazon 2 hours before earnings and made about \u00a3600 with an \u00a318,000 play. Sold the next day.\n\nNow, this next thing is what really pissed me off - When I first started investing, I wanted to do my own DD.\n\nI found a British company called Scirocco Energy. It was a pennystock, trading around the $1 mark, but they had a couple of things I liked. Some mining operations set up for a few years down the line, and it looked pretty slick with some reasonable figures. It was my very first investment, and I put about \u00a330 in, just so I could say I was \"in the market\".\n\nIt traded sideways FOREVER. Until all of a sudden, the other day, it went skyward, 60% in a single day, On no news at all. it was obvious it was being pumped and dumped. I sold and took my tiny $16 profit.\n\nIt irked me though. Someone has found this stock, pumped it up to high heaven and is in the process of dumping it. There's zero regulation. Nobody gives a toss. Nobody cares.\n\nLook at gamestop. Brokers literally turned off the market for a couple of days and caused retail a world of pain.\n\nThe mavis was another glorified pumped up memestock.\n\nIt just stinks.\n\nSo, I'm kinda done with this short term investing.\n\nI'm looking for a long term investment, something I can throw that \u00a318,000 back in and do a Buffet on it. Leave it for a year or two and see what happens. Something which is only gonna go up, even if it is at a very slow rate. Low risk, low reward is fine by me, because my anxiety can't take any more of the huge changes in price on meme stocks.\n\nSuggestions anyone? Stick it all back in amazon? Microsoft? Some ETF that i'm unaware of? Maybe even BRK.B?\n\nI hope this doesn't come across as salty ranting tears because I lost money, in reality, my \u00a330k profile has probably broken even (maybe a tiny loss) since I started investing, but it's really opened my eyes to how it all works, and how much of a casino it all is.\n\nI've got a couple of meme-ish long positions which hopefully might come good this year, but I need some stability in my life.",

        "selftext": "First DD about something I'm familiar with.\n\nI am currently in FAANG tickers plus MSFT. Earnings were good but the stock is either not moving, or went up and came back down. I\u2019m planning to sell everything I\u2019m green in and move the majority over to something that has been killing it which is lumber. It can add some more variety to this sub.\n\nMy husband is in the industry (his company is not publicly traded) and things have been good and bad. It\u2019s been good because people have been paying ridiculous prices for houses. Combine that with the building material shortage and he has been able to raise his profit margins. Very nice commission checks coming home.\n\nIt\u2019s bad because there is not enough lumber for everyone and he\u2019s been having hard conversations with builders who don\u2019t get that they will have to slow down because product is running out.\n\nHere are how lumber futures have been doing.\n\n5 Day \u2013 9.45%\n\n1 Month \u2013 48.41%\n\n3 Month \u2013 69.36%\n\nYTD \u2013 72.15%\n\n1 Year \u2013 359.39%\n\nIf anyone knows how to invest in futures without receiving actual product I would love to know. Don\u2019t want to be that guy that got a bunch of oil delivered to him.\n\nWith how things are going we are going to continue to see a rise in lumber for at least through the summer. The biggest problem is obtaining Engineered Wood Products (EWP) and OSB. Home Depot has quadrupled the price of OSB over the past year. There is also a resin shortage that is needed to make these products. Timber is cheap but the bottleneck is sawmills. Either they have reduced capacity due to covid or they are switching business to OSB because it is more profitable.\n\nI\u2019m looking at companies such as $BCC (38% last 3 months), $WY (23% last 3 months), $LPX (71% last 3 months). They have had great runs and are currently in a dip from the last few days. (Hopefully a dip and not the top).\n\nFirst companies that will be screwed sooner than later will most likely be home builders. They will soon realize they have been building houses for free and will get hit first. They try to hit a 35% profit margin. That margin is eroding by rising costs but they are under contract. Contracts last about 6 months. So expect their profits to go down. Unless they have been really good at guessing lumber futures and buying appropriately.\n\nHome builders have been hitting highs and could be shorted or have puts placed on them. Just look at the top 10 list of publicly traded developer stocks. Be careful with timing. They\u2019ve had big jumps this last week.\n\nBear case: The fed could finally raise interest rates which would decrease demand and let supply catch up. More investment can go into building out saw mills. Builders can get creative and use different materials. This is where steel gang can benefit. Supply could eventually catch up but it may take some time. This is a several month play for now.\n\nCurrent position is shares in $BCC. I've seen nice steady rise over the last few months.\n\nTLDR: Lumber has been on a great run and is getting more scarce. Buy lumber tickers such as $BCC, $WY and $LPX and puts on big home developers. Mid term play.",
