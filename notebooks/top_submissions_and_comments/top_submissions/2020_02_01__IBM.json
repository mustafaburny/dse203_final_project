        "selftext": " \n\nSPCE had a failed mission 5 years ago and blamed the pilot for the crash. \n\nCEO has said for the last 5 years that their SS2 aircrafts were set to launch each year, and of course, they always blamed contractors for not reaching \u201cmilestones\u201d to get it all going. \n\nHere\u2019s a summary of why it won\u2019t succeed and further analysis on the speculative market size that bulls argue:\n\nThey have 600 pre-orders. Why go for such a small number if they have the potential to capture a much large speculated market that the bulls are contending? If they are front runners in this race, they have early bird advantage to take in much more and backlog them if they need to. But why 600 with revenues of only 150M?\n\nMarket cap is currently 5B, which is 42x revenue. And what do the bulls say about this? \u201cStop looking at current revenue, they have a much larger market\u201d. Of who? Multi millionaires and billionaires? \u201cThen they have hypersonic travel for 2 hour travel to London.\u201d Who actually needs to get to London or any other country in 2 hours just to pay a gigantic premium when they can get a private jet and have a personalized/comfortable ride. Last I check, most execs, consultants, etc get to their destination days in advanced anyway.\n\nThen it comes to market cap. I can\u2019t tell if this is a joke, but I hear bull gang compare SPCE market size to Tesla, Spotify, IBM, Microsoft, Uber, Lyft, etc. I\u2019m not going to even have to explain this. The statement in itself has a high enough autistic frequency for even the lowest spectrum of autism to understand how retarded it is. Yes, buying an electric vehicle that will last for years, purchasing a music subscription, buying laptops and software, and getting a daily ride to work is equivalent to going to space for 250k.\n\nNow, when I say 250k, bulls says \"but they will reduce cost when they increase efficiency and have a fleet of 500 planes flying daily.\u201d Firstly, if they reduce cost, it won\u2019t be by significant margins. Why? Because space travel will not be cheap no matter how you put it. Cost of production won\u2019t change unless they can do it with cheap labor in China. Efficiency will be the same unless they hire a herd of engineers working 24/7. R&amp;D will continue to cost more as they try to scale this with large carriers. Ffs, they took years just to get 2 damn planes right. You guys are out here talking about 500 planes. As for scalability. By the time they scale, if they even can, BlueOrigins and SpaceX would have listed and would be flying herds of middle class enthusiasts to space.\n\nNow on to the preorders and future orders. 600 pre-orders are not going to fly this year. They will be backlogged. Why? Because they don\u2019t own airspace. They can barely get their contractors in line with the schedule and you\u2019re expecting them to make 100 flights to the edge of space all in half a year? They expect Branson to be their first passenger on his birthday in July. Do the math. That would be nearly flying every two days from August-December. They have 2 aircrafts right now. Do you really think they are going to expose those two newly made (and still technically under progress) aircrafts under that much fly time? And do you have any idea how risky something like this would be? They aren\u2019t flying planes. Planes can fly all day every day with turbine engines and at low altitudes. We are talking about rocket fuel to the edge of space. And who's the grantee that none of these 100 flights will end in disaster. They blamed the one test flights on pilot error - what makes you think swarms of people would be confident with a company that blamed the crash on the pilot and not a lack of security protocols? Stop with this talk about how they are going to get all these pre-orders done and then add a huge list to the log. My guess, they might fulfill those 600 clients in the next two years. And have a backlog of irked clients that paid such a large deposit to sit around and wait like a saving account that returns -2% per year.\n\nAnd then the talk about hypersonic travel. You guys are talking about it like they have done it. That\u2019s a vision, not a reality. They can\u2019t even commercialize sub-hypersonic travel and they are talking about hypersonic travel at the forefront of this project as if it\u2019s reality. You\u2019re hearing an upbeat CEO trying to raise more capital. The reality is that they haven\u2019t even flown a crew to space yet. They haven't even had a full 6 passengers fly yet.\n\nAs for the newly released sec filing for the warrants. 31M shares. Bull gang is thinking, ah this is regulatory stuff, it won\u2019t get exercised. Literally two funds just filed for 11M on the same day. This is not a coincidence? They are listed for $11.50 per share. Institutions aren\u2019t going to be buying in at market price at this time. Those funds are buying at the warrant price and that\u2019s probably why it happened on the same day. It the share price holds above $18 for 7 more days, these warrants can be exercised. Dilution will almost certainly lead to a dump in this pumped stock. CEO needs money and it's pretty clear at this point why they proposed these 31M shares. It's a 15% dilution!",

        "selftext": "Alright fellow autismos listen up. If the beer virus doesn't tank the market this is freest money you will ever see. Semiconductor stocks are way up, AMD and NVDA are printing like crazy. AAPL is still putting up impressive numbers in spite of the guidance adjustment they just gave. As some of you may know most of the big semiconductors are reliant on two companies. Here's a chart to show where the money goes:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v0obj5ffxyh41.png?width=2338&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efb986fbced13dc0118b0af6ae24c209004810c6\n\nGlobal Foundries is a private fabricator (sorry no tendies on these guys), they focus on the older 14nm process (they tried 7nm and gave up because they found it was unaffordable to outfit a plant to fab the chips. Because of this IBM switched to Samsung for it's next-gen chips). Intel is also famously struggling to get 7nm up and running. Only two companies really have play in the 7nm space, Samsung and TSMC (traded as TSM) Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. TSMC is largest dedicated semiconductor foundry in the world. Qualcomm, Nvidia, AMD, and Apple all buy chips from TSMC. The more each of these companies is in demand, the more money TSMC makes. Their competition is weak right now, Samsung Semiconductor is huge, but you can't invest in them, and they only really make chips for their phones sold outside the US and for IBM (and those chips are for supercomputers, servers, and mainframes not for consumers). They mostly focus on DRAM and SSDs. TSMC is a position right now where it is indispensable to a lot of the worlds largest corporations (Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon all use TSMC products). Right now all these companies are on an absolute tear. TSMC announces earning on April 16th and option prices are ripe. Go get them tendies boiz.",

        "selftext": "https://quant.stackexchange.com/a/43343\n\n&gt;Can someone please explain to me how stock prices go up and down? What are the underlying physical and information technology phenomena and algorithms that drive a stock up or down?\n\nThis question may be better on the personal finance or the economics site, but I will answer it here. The question is very difficult because no one thing causes it. There is also a very different solution to the question if you are asking about the immediate future versus a long period of time as the factors are different.\n\nIn the short-run, if you look at the mechanics of a trade, there are two main broad categories of orders and in the United States, two types of markets. The two order types are market orders and limit orders. The two market types are auction markets and dealer markets. Both of these sentences are overgeneralizations. The NYSE does not work the way the now defunct Arizona exchange worked. Fill-or-kill orders do not work the way a market order for a single round lot works.\n\nThe key element of equity market orders is that until an offer is made, the short-run supply curve and the demand curve do not intersect. The existence of a bid-ask spread implies the curves are non-intersecting in the immediate period. For an order to be filled, the immediate curve has to be shifted. Of course, the true short-run curves includes as yet unseen supply and demand. I may be willing to pay\u00a0$50 per share for IBM but may not have placed my order yet. I might be eating lunch. The immediate demand curve cannot include my order, but the short-run curve, at least in theory, does.\n\nMarket makers and specialists keep a supply of cash and shares on hand to cover market orders in the event no other party has an outstanding market order that would cover the transaction. The bid-ask spread is their compensation for carrying the inventory risk. As an example, imagine a bid price of 49.50 and an ask of 49.75. You buy shares at market for 49.75. The bid and ask change to 49.600 and 50.00. Someone else wants to sell, so they ask 49.60 for the shares. The market maker pays 49.60 and recovers their inventory that they had sold to you, pocketing the fifteen cents.\n\nWhen someone places a market order, it drains the liquidity of the market maker or specialist by taking away their inventory of cash or shares. A market order allows a filling of shares, pretty much on demand, but the price is set by the dealer if there is no outstanding limit order to cover it. For larger orders, a market order is an order to continue bidding any amount of money to guarantee you are the high bidder as a buyer or the low bidder as a seller in order to be certain that your order will be filled, no matter what.\n\nLimit orders state the prices that can be paid by a broker in order for you to buy or sell shares. If I am willing to sell at\u00a0$50, then I cannot receive less than\u00a0$50 (gross of commissions). I can receive more. If I am willing to pay\u00a0$12.50 per share, then I will not have to pay more than\u00a0$12.50 per share before commissions. If there is no offer inside my limits, then my order will never be filled.\n\nFor market orders, the price is driven by the bidding process. Market orders will keep bidding higher and higher or lower and lower until the order is filled. For limit orders, which provide liquidity to the market makers, those limits set the pricing for the market makers as they can use those orders to fill their obligations. People who state the prices publicly are the ones who decide what the price will be. In exchange for setting a limit order, the brokers are obligated to get the best price available for the maker of those limit orders. So if I say I will pay\u00a0$12.50, but a broker can get it for me at\u00a0$11.40, then I will get it at $11.40.\n\nNow there is one more wrinkle in the short-run. When you look at a chart or trades on a ticker, that is not the actual order in which they happened. That is the order in which they were reported. Large orders would disrupt the market, so they are only reported as a weighted average of the trade prices and only after that order would no longer have a disruptive effect on the price. So if there is an order to buy 10,000 shares and everyone knew that people might make really high limit orders to make it hard to fill the big order and others might glom on to buy knowing the price will be driven up by the large order. So if you see a price change, it might not reflect the true current price structure. The bid-ask spread does, but the immediate spread does not appear on the charts and isn't recorded for most of US history.\n\nIn the long run, prices are driven by large macroeconomic forces. If you have a choice of eating or buying shares, you will choose to eat. This means that stock market money is always leftover money. It is money above your consumption needs. In addition, other assets compete for your money, such as bonds and bank accounts. As such, if someone will pay enough to borrow money, stocks cannot give a lower return as they make no promises about future cash flows.\n\nFurthermore, stocks are countercyclical. There is more free money during an economic expansion than a recession. So stock prices are the worst when people need money the most, and the best when they least need it. Bonds are procyclical. When the economy is doing poorly, people seek the safety of bonds. Also, of importance, inflation falls as there is no demand for money, comparatively and so bonds become of greater value. Likewise, to stimulate the economy interest rates fall, so the present value of bonds rises.\n\nIn the very long term, dividends follow inflation on a lagged basis, and prices move with corporate productivity. Improvements in productivity that persist have a long impact on prices. In the very long term, inflation and persisting interest rates impact prices. In the very long term, demographic factors matter. In the US, baby boomers are retiring and selling their shares to live off the money. There are fewer young people, fewer even now that immigrants are being deported. If foreigners are willing to pick up the slack, the price will rise. If native borns need even more shares to be sold, then prices will fall. Finally, taxes have a complicated relationship with stocks. Low tax levels are bad in the long run. High tax levels are bad in the long run. That is because levels of taxation reflect the public expenditure on infrastructures like roads or law enforcement. The disaster that was Kansas' tax structure is a great example. Kansas destroyed its economy with tax rates that were unsustainably low. So did Greece. On the other hand, during the Cold War tax rates were very high, at the margin, but didn't always buy useful public goods.\n\nThere is also a difference between auction markets and dealer markets. In auction markets, buyers bid against other buyers for the right to buy while sellers bid against other sellers for the right to sell. These are high volume markets and so price swings tend to be smaller because there is a greater level of competition and more observable orders that permits easier price discovery. Dealer markets are more like retail stores. All trades are with dealers and no trades are with other individuals. Dealers set the prices, though competitively against other dealers.\n\nAs the dealers are covering the markets out of their own pockets, the liquidity costs are higher, so the spreads are wider. This makes markets look more volatile even when they are basically flat and moving sideways. In dealer markets, ever trade is wider.\n\nThere are tons of algorithms in place, but there isn't just one. If you would look at my trades as an \"algorithm\", it wouldn't look like another investor's algorithm. I use long run valuation rules. A day trader uses a minute-by-minute or second-by-second time horizon. We are not using the same thinking and we do not have the same goals. There are thousands of separate algorithms in place.",

        "selftext": "I started investing 5 months ago, my strategy is to buy some stocks to hold long term every couple of months or quarterly (there is minimum comission). To me current market looks like it's going into a bubble, so I also plan to save cash, so I can buy in case market drops.\n\nSo my stock strategy is to seek good dividend stocks that are undervalued and besides one insurance company and medicine supplies I picked IBM reasoning: PE was low, I expected it do do better with RedHat, dividend was good. By beginners luck (I was planning to buy med. sup. company but it was high so I bought IBM which was low instead) I timed it well and bought 8 shares on 15th January at 136$ Now it's at 156$ My technical analysis shows it can touch 160-165 but then can go lower. I still expect it to go up in 2020. \n\nConsidering the hit (1-2%) I would take by selling, I should stick with it for 2020. I plan to purchases more stocks in March",

        "selftext": "**Azure is increasingly being recognized for the driver it is and Microsoft is quickly shedding its reputation for being a Windows company.**\n\nYou can't go far now without hearing that Azure Clouds (IaaS/PaaS), Office 365 Clouds (SaaS), and Dynamics (SaaS) are the absolute focus for the company. Windows, Xbox, and hardware are just funnels into Azure, Azure services, and data-collection endpoints that provide telemetry to improving the underlying technology fabric of the shared Windows and Windows Server codebase that help to power much of Azure outside of Linux. Speaking of Linux, with half of Azure compute workloads being Linux, Microsoft has equal motivation to &lt;3 it. As far as the market is concerned, Windows is just a reliable cash flow. As far as data is considered, it's going to be a goldmine for a long time.\n\nMy hypothesis is that as $MSFT is increasingly valued as a cloud services company, and less as a traditional software company and hardware provider, the P/E ratio premium will increase. What investor doesn't love reliable, enterprise, high gross margin cash that just keeps coming? The most recent earnings was the best in history, and there is no indication anywhere that trend is going to change. IT spend on cloud is only going to increase.\n\n**Azure has only increasing momentum, recognition by various industries as a preferred option over AWS, and differentiation that is both gaining on AWS and overcoming it as a market leader.**\n\nThe momentum of Azure at this point is simply undeniable. As the current cohort of hyperscale cloud incumbents continue to drop like flies in IaaS (the largest source of revenue for cloud platforms today), that momentum will accelerate. $GOOG (the only other actual competition left) is not going to make it in the enterprise with their recent loss of trust from the leak on backing off cloud and data harvesting, Red Hat and OpenShift won't be enough to save $IBM and it's paltry existence, and $BABA won't make further inroads to Western markets, limiting itself to China and SEA. Multi-cloud / poly-cloud implementations won't save them, either, as $MSFT and $AMZN establish their moats. No business idolizes needing to train two different ways of doing the same things, so they will tend to lean on a primary provider. We are talking a $92bn global market by 2023 with a 25% CAGR, and that is before we even get to PaaS, where $MSFT is a clear leader.

        "selftext": "\nHere\u2019s the background about SPCE that all you bulls rarely discuss: \n\nSPCE had a failed mission 5 years ago and blamed the pilot for the crash. Pretty miserable excuse. \n\nCEO has said for the last 5 years that their SS2 aircrafts were set to launch each year, and of course, they always blamed contractors for not reaching \u201cmilestones\u201d to get it all going. Again, miserable excuse. \n\n\nHere\u2019s a summary of why it won\u2019t succeed and further analysis on the speculative market size that these uninformed bulls have:\n\nThey have 600 pre-orders. Why go for such a small number if they have the potential to capture a much large speculated market that the bulls are contending? If they are front runners in this race, they have early bird advantage to take in much more and backlog them if they need to. But why 600 with revenues of only 150M?\n\nMarket cap is currently 5B, which is 42x revenue. And what do the bulls say about this? \u201cStop looking at current revenue, they have a much larger market\u201d. Of who? Multi millionaires and billionaires? \u201cThen they have hypersonic travel for 2 hour travel to London.\u201d Who actually fucking needs to get to London or any other country in 2 hours just to pay a gigantic premium when they can get a private jet and have a personalize ride. You think C-suites are going to have diarrhea all day and will need to get to London in 2 hours? Last I check, most execs, consultants, etc get to their destination days in advanced anyway. \n\nThen it comes to market cap. I can\u2019t tell if this is a joke, but I hear bull gang compare SPCE  market size to Tesla, Spotify, IBM, Microsoft,  Uber, Lyft, etc. I\u2019m not going to even have to explain this. The statement in itself has a high enough autistic frequency for even the lowest spectrum of autism to understand how retarded it is. Yes, buying an electric vehicle that will last for years, purchasing a music subscription,  buying laptops and software, and getting a daily ride to work is equivalent to going to space for 250k.\n\nNow, when I say 250k, I hear bull gang say \u201cyou\u2019re retarded. They will reduce cost when they increase efficiency and have a fleet of 500 planes flying daily.\u201d Goddamn this is almost as autist has stormwillpass plays. Firstly, if they reduce cost, it won\u2019t be by significant margins. Why? Because space travel will not be cheap no matter how you put it. Cost of production won\u2019t change unless they can do it with cheap labor in China. Efficiency will be the same unless they hire a herd of engineers working 24/7. R&amp;D will continue to cost more as they try to scale this with large carriers. Ffs, they took years just to get 2 damn planes right. You guys are out here talking about 500 planes. As for scalability. By the time they scale, if they even can, BlueOrigins and SpaceX would have listed and would be flying herds of middle class enthusiasts to space. \n\nNow on to the preorders and future orders. 600 pre-orders are not going to fly this year. They will be backlogged to shit. Why? Because they don\u2019t own airspace. They can barely get their contractors in line with the schedule and you\u2019re expecting them to make 100 flights to the edge of space all in half a year? They expect Branson to be their first passenger on his birthday in July. Do the math. That would be nearly flying every single day from August-December. They have 2 aircrafts right now. Do you really think they are going to expose those two newly made (and still technically under progress) aircrafts under that much fly time? And do you have any idea how risky something like this would be? They aren\u2019t flying planes. Planes can fly all day every day with turbine engines and at low altitudes. We are talking about rocket fuel to the edge of space. Stop with this talk about how they are going to get all these pre orders done and then add a huge list to the log. My guess, they might fulfill those 600 clients in the next two years. And have a backlog of irked clients that paid such a large deposit to sit around and watch Branson slamming young girls on his private island. \n\nAnd then the talk about hypersonic travel. You guys are talking about it like they have done it. That\u2019s a vision, not a reality. They can\u2019t even commercialize sub-hypersonic travel and they are talking about hypersonic travel at the forefront of this project as if it\u2019s reality. You\u2019re hearing an upbeat CEO trying to raise more capital. You\u2019re drowning out the facts and the reality that they haven\u2019t even flown a damn crew to space yet. They have even had a full 6 passengers fly yet. \n\nAs for the newly released sec filing for the warrants. 31M shares. Bull gang is thinking, ah this is regulatory stuff, it won\u2019t get exercised. Literally two funds just filed for 11M on the same day. You think this is a coincidence? A couple people DMed me about this exact thing. They are listed for $11.50 per share. Institutions aren\u2019t going to be buying in at market price at this time. Those funds are buying at the warrant price and that\u2019s probably why it happened on the same day.",

        "selftext": "The CDC has stated that outbreaks in the US are inevitable. The US lacks a centralized healthcare system and the responsibility to manage this pandemic will fall largely on community healthcare systems. Where will they spend the funds that will be allocated to them by federal/state/local governments and private individuals? One less obvious play is population health management software. \n\nThese systems allow providers to triage demographics. It's not feasible to test/treat/vaccinate entire populations in a location, so providers will need to identify which demographics are more likely to contract the virus and administer care accordingly. \n\nCurrently there are no pure plays in this space and many of the players are private, including the largest - Epic. Publicly traded companies in this space offer it alongside a myriad of other health IT products:\n\n* Cerner\n* Allscripts\n* Optum (owned by UnitedHealth Group)\n* IBM\n* 3M\n* Oracle\n\nPersonally I've been holding UNH since 2012 when I heard about their substantial investments in healthcare IT and believed they're position as the largest insurer gave them access to a large high-quality dataset. If I had more cash sitting around I would probably put it in Cerner.",
