        "selftext": "eToro was founded as RetailFX in 2007[11] in Tel Aviv, by brothers Yoni Assia and Ronen Assia together with David Ring.[12]\n\nIn 2010, the firm released the eToro OpenBook social investment platform, along with its CopyTrading feature, that enables investors to view, follow and copy the network's top traders automatically.[13] Later that year, the firm released its first Android app for access via mobile devices.[14]\n\nBetween 2007 and 2013, the company raised $31.5 million in four rounds of funding.[15][16] In December 2014, it raised $27 million from Russian and Chinese investors.[17] In December 2017, it joined CoinDash as partners to develop Blockchain-based social trading.[18] In 2018, it raised a further $100 million in a private funding round.[19] Overall, more than $162 million has been invested in the company by investment firms Spark Capital, SBI Holdings, Germany\u2019s CommerzVentures, Chinese bank Ping An Insurance, Russian state-owned financial firm Sberbank,[20] Korea Investment Partners, technology-focused BRM Group, and China Minsheng Financial Holdings.[5][21][22]\n\nIn 2013, the firm introduced the capability to invest in stocks and CFDs, with an initial offering of 110 stock products.[23] The same year, it was authorized to offer its services in the UK by the FCA regulatory authority, under the subsidiary eToro UK.[24] In January 2014, the firm added cryptocurrencies to its investment instruments.[25][26]\n\nIn April 2014, the firm added 130 British and German stocks composing the FTSE 100 Index and the DAX30 indices to the company's stock selection.[27]\n\nIn 2017, it launched a CopyPortfolio feature, enabling investors to copy investment portfolios from the best-performing traders.[28]\n\nIn 2018, it launched a cryptcurrency wallet for Android and iOS.[29][30] In May 2018, it entered the US market by offering 10 cryptocurrencies:[31] In November 2018, it announced the launch of GoodDollar, a non-profit, open-source community project aimed to reduce global wealth inequality through universal basic income (UBI) using blockchain technology.[32]\n\nIn March 2019, eToro acquired Danish blockchain company Firmo for an undisclosed sum.[33][34] In October 2019, eToro released a sentiment-based crypt portfolio using AI technology to evaluate Twitter's current positive or negative impressions of digital assets.[35] In November 2019, the firm acquired Delta, a crypt portfolio tracker application company, based in Belgium.[36][37]\n\nAs of May 2020, the firm had 13 million registered accounts.[38] In March 2021, eToro announced that it is planning to become a publicly traded company through a reverse subsidiary merger with FinTech Acquisition Corp V (NASDAQ:FTCV), a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) backed by former Bancorp CEO Betsy Z. Cohen.[39][40] The combined company will operate as eToro Group Ltd and have an implied estimated enterprise value of $10.4 billion at closing with $650 million in funding coming from private investment in public equity (PIPE) from Softbank Vision Fund 2,[41] Third Point, Fidelity Management, Wellington Management, ION Investment Group and Research Co.[42][43]",

        "selftext": "Most investors have probably never heard of exosomes until Codiak\u2019s (NASDAQ: CDAK) chief exec, Doug Williams, made his pitch about this cool molecules at the JP Morgan conference two weeks ago. So for starters, let's define what is an exosome. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles (EVs) of endosomal origin that range in size between 30 and 150nm. Exosomes are secreted by a wide range of cells, since virtually all living cells utilize exosome-mediated communication. Exosomes carry cell-specific cargos of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids that are selectively taken up by recipient cells.  In essence, these are a critical building block of organic life and have a myriad of unexplored biopharma applications.  \n\nThe cargo contained within exosomes can offer information for a wide range of diseases, therefore exosomes can also act as prognostic indicators and predictors of a patient\u2019s response to a specific course of treatment.  Exosome-based diagnostics are minimally invasive, offering both ease-of-use and speed of detection. Numerous approaches are being researched for creating drug-loaded exosomes and they can exert powerful effects. For example, if a patient has a disease caused by a missing or defective protein or microRNA, the patient\u2019s exosomes can be isolated, modified with the appropriate siRNA or protein, and injected back into the patient for treatment.\n\nFor these reasons, exosomes have gone from being overlooked to rapidly gaining momentum as a novel strategy for accessing the therapeutic effects of cells without the risks and difficulties of administering cells to patients.  Exosome-related technologies have been developing rapidly over the past few years. Substantial growth is expected for the market as they get highly integrated into the elite healthcare fields such as liquid biopsy, precision medicine and regenerative medicine.\n\nWithin the past 5 years, there have been at least 7 major partnership deals within the exosome industry, 8 large venture capital events, and 2 landmark acquisitions.  Today, the exosome industry is witnessing rising numbers of clinicals trials investigating exosome therapeutics and diagnostics. Here are some listed companies taking exosome science to the next level:\n\n**Innocan Pharma (CSE: INNO) (FSE: IP4) (OTCQB: INNPF) Combining Exosomes &amp; CBD**\n\nInnocan Pharma, in collaboration with a Tel Aviv university team, is developing a revolutionary cell therapy - based technology, loaded with CBD (Cannabidiol), designed to target coronavirus infected lung cells and central nervous system diseases. Innocan\u2019s CLX Therapy holds the potential to provide a highly synergistic effect of anti-inflammatory properties and help in the recovery of infected lung cells. This product is planned to act as a \"guided missile\" to the infected lungs, combining the cell healing properties of exosomes and the anti-inflammatory properties of CBD.\n\nInnocan's CBD Loaded Exosome (CLX) Therapy project demonstrates the capability of having reliable large-scale production of exosomes and is an important milestone in the CLX Therapy development process. Innocan managed to produce trillions of exosomes in a short period of time in a 3-dimensional bioreactor, and that may lead to economic large-scale exosome production for the CLX. This achievement is expected to pave the way for larger tests and studies.  Combine its CLX program R&amp; with their established credentials as a cannabis/CBD powerhouse, and in a final evaluation this company holds a lot of long-term promise for making strong and early inroads into the exosome market.\n\n**Sarepta Therapeutics (NASDAQ: SRPT) and Codiak BioSciences (NASDAQ: CDAK)**\n\nOn June 22, 2020, Sarepta Therapeutics and Codiak BioSciences signed a global research and option agreement to design and develop engineered exosome therapeutics to deliver gene therapy, gene editing and RNA technologies for neuromuscular diseases. The engineered exosome approach offers the potential to effectively deliver genetic therapeutics without triggering the adaptive immune response. The two-year agreement includes up to five neuromuscular targets. Codiak is eligible to receive up to $72.5 million in upfront and near-term license payments plus research funding.  That equates to a lot of capital that, if invested wisely, can go back into research for the next generation of exosome studies and clinical trials.\n\n**Jazz Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: JAZZ) and Codiak BioSciences (NASDAQ: CDAK)**\n\nOn January 03, 2019, Jazz Pharmaceuticals and Codiak BioSciences signed a strategic collaboration agreement focused on the research, development and commercialization of exosome therapeutics to treat cancer. Codiak granted Jazz an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to develop, manufacture and commercialize therapeutic candidates directed at five targets to be developed using Codiak\u2019s engEx precision engineering platform for exosome therapeutics. The targets focus on oncogenes that have been well validated in hematological malignancies and solid tumors but have been undruggable with current modalities. Codiak received a $56 million upfront payment.\n\nIn sum, the companies explored above are all approaching the budding exosome industry from different angles.  Innocan\u2019s point-of-departure is CBD and its range of applications in the biomed/pharma sectors. Likewise, Codiak, Sarepta, and Jazz are all making powermoves to determine the efficacy of exosome therapies in diverse areas such as immune disorders and hematological malignancies.",
