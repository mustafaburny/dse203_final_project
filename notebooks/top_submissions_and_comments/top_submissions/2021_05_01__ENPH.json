        "selftext": "No unique stock DD this week guys, I had a senior moment and my brain was a day off.  Probably for the best, because this market is off-the-rails broken right now, anyways.  Literally down is up and up is down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInstead, let's do an update on the Nrd ETF for the month.  I'll go over some of my trades and, as I have time maybe read how some of you played them and offer some not-financial-advice on how to optimize the plays.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor those who want to go to the original discussion, you can find it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n225dj/because_people_keep_asking_the_nrdrage_etf_may/).  I'll quote box the positions below and then go into it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; *My long list (both established positions and sentiment/momentum trades I'll make):*\n\n1. *$CLNE (Positions established; look at DD)*\n2. *$MA*\n3. *$BABA (Positions established; look at DD)*\n4. *$BE (Positions established; look at DD)*\n5. *$CAT (Positions re-established today in fact - July 230c's that I timed perfectly)*\n6. *$EXPE*\n7. *$AAPL*\n8. *$ALGN*\n9. *$PSFE (Positions established earlier)*\n10. *$CVX*\n11. *$ENPH (Positions established today)*\n12. *$TSCO (Positions established)*\n13. *$CAR (Positions established)*\n14. *$KMI (September 18s)*\n15. *$BB (Positions established; see DD)*\n\n&gt;*The Short watch list:*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Note  that, when it comes to shorting, I do a lot more scalping and very  short term swing trading.  May is typically a month of low volume, so  you have to be agile.  Puts are generally 2 steps out of the money at  open.  Do your own DD.  This is also not a complete list, just a daily  watch list of companies that I feel are going to fare roughly or whom  have typically underperformed this time of year.  This is also not a  short and hold list.

Real ugly.  Volume completely dried up, which gave the shorts free rein to walk it down into oblivion all week.  They had an earnings call on Thursday, which was actually quite good (missed on top line EPS, but beat on revenue, upgraded forward guidance, and opened up more about the 1.5bln $AMZN contract, which sounds better and better the more I hear about it.  It actually traded up for a while this morning, but then just got absolutely assaulted the rest of the day because everybody was sitting it out.  I've averaged down - hard - on this one at this stage to make sure that I'm always within a day or two's striking distance of at least breaking even on the June calls.  I have started buying September calls at the same 13 strike.  I also started buying up more shares at $8.85 this afternoon.  I love a sale.   I'm going to re-evaluate how I feel about the June calls in the coming week.  Given that this stock has had 6 red days out of 7, any moves I make right now would be reactionary.  Further, one interesting thing I noticed was that, in the last 5 or 10 minutes or so, other whale buyers showed up HARD at the $8.79 price.  For a stock who's order book all day was just a series of 3-digit and low 4-digit offers, to see 50,000 share bids show up tells me that the shorts who had been fucking this thing all week were covering AND the buyers were coming back in (probably the same assholes who shorted it).**\n2. *$MA:  I'm still yet to open a position here.  I just haven't liked the price action, and the charts have been very choppy.  If you've played it, let me know how it worked out for you.  Looking back at the weekly, I see some openings NOW, but they weren't real clear in the moment.*\n3. $BABA:  I took the opportunity at 226 to finish filling out my call position as referenced in the last solo stock DD.  I know I said in that DD it was impossible to screw up, but apparently I underestimated the internet some, because I've had people messaging me saying they bought in at 234 and are down and \"feeling pain\", when I explicitly said not to buy at those levels.  It's interesting to me that the Chinese stocks, which are universally accepted to be underpriced, are moving in sympathy with domestic growth stocks.  That's broken.  \n4. **$BE:  Bought more August 31's on Thursday when it was at the bottom.  Sub-$20 was too good of an equity price to pass up.  I really liked the price movement on it yesterday and today.  Their earnings call was SPECTACULAR, and their leadership said all the right things.  I feel really good about this one to finally start moving independently of the rest of the green energy sector. Loser for right now, but I'm not getting shaken out**\n5. $CAT:  Those July 230's were made of latinum.  Closed out today for fat profits.  I consider this trade over until $CAT comes back down into the 220's.\n6. $EXPE:  Bought in yesterday morning.  Closed my position at about 2 pm EST today.  I sat on this trade a little too long and left about $3 a share on the table, but profit is profit.  It was a very nice trade.  This trade is closed\n7. *$AAPL:  I never actually got into my long position.  I closed my pre-existing short on Tuesday and have been eyeing an entry, but haven't found one I like yet.*\n8. $ALGN:  In Tuesday @ 575-ish, out today at 600.  Trade is closed\n9. $PSFE:  As discussed in last week's post, I ended up removing this because the apes started trying to meme stock it, and I replaced it with $CVS, which has made me enough tendies to spring for the top shelf lube for when I fuck.  The $CVS trade is still ongoing and a good one to eye an entry, IMO\n10. $CVX:  Jumped in Monday, and I'm still in the trade.  I like the movement on this one.  Still a good trade to enter, IMO\n11. **$ENPH:  I'm upside down on this one, largely because I've been unwilling to average down on it.  My bags aren't super heavy, but I do have some Samsonites right now.  Going to just store it away and let it marinate.  The price action is still downwards here, so if you're eyeing this one, let it come in further**\n12. $TSCO:  The price action on this has been amazing.  I've actually been holding this for quite some time, so my entry is way in the rear view mirror.  But I love how smoothly it's run and feel it's still got a lot more room to till.\n13. **$CAR:  This is another one I've been holding forever, and just don't want to create a taxable event on.  The price action has generally been flat, if you remove the fact they had earnings this week, and we all know what earnings means in this market.  I still like this one for a buy and hold**\n14. $KMI:  We don't talk about $KMI.  But if you're interested, maybe go look at a chart, because it'll make you wet\n15. **$BB:  I haven't done anything with this, and honestly, couldn't even tell you how it's performed.  Probably poorly.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The shorts:\n\n1. $TSLA:  I jumped in at $712.11.  Everybody in the daily told me I hated money.  I got out at 666, even though I was swearing up and down it was going to 650.  The price action just looked like it was turning, so I took tendies.  Then it went to 650 like I thought it would.  Could have done it better, but profit is profit.  I'm eyeing a re-entry to the short side on this one.  I'm thinking 685-690 I'll likely re-establish\n2. $UPST:  My most reliable short  I'm twenty-some dollars a share in the green already and still holding.\n3. $TWTR:  It's been SUUUUUPER choppy this week.  I got out at 52.80 for a nice gain, but I've hated the price action.  Staying away from here on out\n4. *$CLOV:  Never had a good opportunity to play it.  Still watching*\n5. $SPCE:  Death, taxes, and $SPCE tanking.  Still holding for a modest gain with stop losses in place.  Been pretty flat.  Probably still a good short if you can time it.\n6. $PTON:  God bless that Shortbus All-Star kid who got eaten by the treadmill.  Lambo squad trade.  Closed out, and consider the trade done unless I see it in the mid 90's again\n7. *$TSM:  Never entered.  I thought I had a price target in mind, but I wussed out at the last moment.  Doesn't matter, Theta Semi living up to its name*\n8. $BLNK:  30% gain.  I'll look for re-entry at 35.\n9. **$GS:  Defying the odds.  Trimmed my position to hedge losses, but this one isn't working out so far. Will look for weakness to re-establish in full**\n10. $PINS:  Closed half my position at 60 for a nice gain.  Holding the other half with tight stop losses, but I'm optimistic it's got further to fall\n11. *$BMBL:  I missed it.  Kicking myself for it, too.  I knew it was gonna fall.  Not sure how much downside is left*\n12. $EGHT:  Oh the sweet sound of an equity dying.  This one is printing for me hard, and I think it's still got another 3-4 dollars to the downside in it\n13. $MDB:  See $EGHT.  Exact same story\n14. $PCG:  Riding it down like a submissive whore.  I'll probably run this one the entire month.  Printing nicely, still plenty of room to drop\n15. $DASH:  LAMBO SQUAD!  Oh man, this one has been magnificent.  And it's still got downside.  Fair value IMO is 80.  It'll never hit it, but I think 110 is entirely doable.\n16. $GRUB:  Reliable gainer to the downside, but not as nice as $DASH.  Still holding. \n17. $WORK:  Quietly dropped on no news.  Just shows how broken the market is, because the buyout price is baked in.  I was following this so I could see news to potentially short $CRM, but none came.  $CRM, however, fell nicely on the week, but I wasn't there to catch it.  Trade is likely running out of breath\n18. *$CAN  Never entered it, which is sad because it could have been a good gainer.  I'll rectify that mistake on some upwards momentum*\n19. $BYND:  Yacht squad.  What an amazing loser.  Still holding.  I want to see 95\n20. $AFRM:  I love the concept, but I hate the business model.  This one has been a great gainer for me, but I want to see 44.  Still room to drop\n21. $COUR:  Inadvertent earnings play.  Didn't realize t hey were reporting this week.  Happy accidents.  2 bagger, excellent play.  I covered this afternoon.  I think there's probably still another 10% to the downside possible, but I actually like the model and don't want to tempt fate.  This trade is closed to me.\n22. *$HEP:  Got in and got out at dead even.  Thought I had a good entry but then things got choppy and weird.  Removed it from my watch list.  This trade is dead to me with a draw.*\n23. *$CSCO:  never entered.  Which is good, because it's run up.  I'm eyeing an entry*\n24. $PLNT:  Another great winner.  I wanna see another 4 dollars to the downside  Trade still live\n25. $QS:  Patently obvious this was gonna drop like a rock.  Ask me when it's at $10 and I'll probably still be shorting it\n26. *$WMT:  I got cute and walked into a flat trade.  Will exit next week, win lose or draw.*\n27. **$ADT:  Took the L here.  Entered at $9.27, got scared off this afternoon with a small loss.  Took it off my watch list, trade is dead to me**\n28. *$TW, $RTX, $COF, $NOC, $ADM, $AAL, $WHR, $LUMN, didn't enter any of these.  $COF, $AAL and $WHR are the only ones I'm even still tracking.  The others are dead to me*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecord after 1 week:  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLongs:  8-5-2 (given the week that just happened, I'll take it)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShorts:  18-2-15:  Most of the draws are simply because I never entered the trades.  Take out the trades where I never expended powder and it's 18-2-2.  \n\n# \n\n# Overall (played trades):  26-2-2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo....how'd you do?  Let's hear it.",

I also plan on keeping my 2023 leaps as I have a lot now and I do think this stock could be 300 by Jan 2023 or Dec 2022(if so ill make 6 figures, I just think the upside is here and not selling the bottom).

        "selftext": "I'm on a mission to provide quality DD on different industries and stocks. Ever since the Gamestop saga many new retail investors have joined the show. A lot of the time they invest in stocks just because they are \"popular\" without really knowing the industry or the company's business model. I'm trying to bridge that gap with my weekly DD series. I hope you enjoy.\n\n# Overview \n\nThe era of clean energy is upon us and the timing couldn\u2019t be better to get behind Joe Biden\u2019s newly proposed [2.3 trillion dollar](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/us/politics/biden-climate-plan.html) clean energy infrastructure plan. Clean energy generation is about to ride some huge tailwinds as described by this article on Financial Times.\n\n\u201cBiden\u2019s plan would see an infusion of more than $350bn directly into clean energy driving electric-vehicle infrastructure, reinvigorating the grid and boosting research and development plus an estimated $400bn extending and expanding tax credits for clean energy generation and storage. It would also set a clean energy standard mandating utilities to produce power that is carbon-free by 2035.\u201d\n\n**Transition to Clean Energy, the Solar Industry, and Enphase**\n\nOne industry already seeing increased demand as the world shifts to clean energy is solar. In the last decade alone, solar has experienced an average annual growth rate of **42%** ([source](https://www.seia.org/solar-industry-research-data#:~:text=Solar%2520as%2520an%2520Economic%2520Engine,investment%2520in%2520the%2520American%2520economy.)). Solar is currently regarded as the cheapest source of energy in the history of the world, far surpassing coal and gas, as well as beat out wind and other renewables.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4vjgoa4ch3071.png?width=758&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f94e4243370525359d8b781d773996be18ef94c0\n\nLet\u2019s talk about one of the biggest players currently dominating this industry, Enphase (ENPH). Enphase is the largest designer and manufacturer in the solar energy market selling micro-inverters for homes, installing solar panels onto their roofs, and currently capturing over 50% of the U.S market. Enphase\u2019s strategy revolves around four core pillars: new product development (innovating the micro-inverter), residential energy storage, commercial solar projects, and services platform.\n\nBy executing the strategies mentioned above they are expecting to increase their Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM) from $4.1 billion in 2020 to roughly \\~$14 billion in 2023. All of this is powered by organic growth and the new clean energy movement providing margins of roughly 40% which are worthy enough to write home about.\n\n**Setbacks**\n\nLike any industry or company, there will be some challenging obstacles to overcome. For Enphase, one of their biggest hurdles is the global semiconductor chip-shortage, which should give some headwinds until at least the end of 2021. The chip-shortage is not a new headline and has been plaguing many industries. On Enphase\u2019s recent earnings call management noted that although demand remains strong they can\u2019t fill orders because there isn\u2019t enough material for them to keep up with demand. However, these are short term headwinds and the global semiconductor chip shortage is not expected to continue forever. Thus, this represents an excellent buying opportunity for ENPH. In a RARE occurrence even Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, AND Barclays [all agreeing on one thing](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/28/enphase-posts-record-quarter-stock-slides-on-chip-shortage-pains.html) that was recommending buying the recent Enphase dip.\n\n\u201cThe silver lining is obvious to us: those looking to take the long-view on ENPH will correctly view this eventually transient headwind, as a buying opportunity on any weakness,\u201d noted Barclays, while Goldman said that \u201cdemand and margins remain robust.\u201d\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nEnphase\u2019s dominance in this industry has allowed them to capture a large piece of this ever-growing pie. Their flagship product is still innovating with each iteration while they expand commercial and residential offerings. Their SAM is expecting to grow exponentially over the next 5-10 years and ENPH is aggressively (and succeeding) trying to capture ever dollar of it. The stock has tumbled from all-time-highs, which leaves some breathing room for a good entry since their valuation has contracted.",

        "selftext": "So I have some understanding of wash sales but would love some confirmation.  So I got caught bag holding ENPH with a cost basis of $145.  So my idea was to sell the shares and by a LEAPS to take advantage of the loss but still profit from the upside (if there is any).

This way I\u2019m not missing out and any potential rebound and if I\u2019m still down and can harvest some losses.  Would this work to avoid a wash?  I understand that I am taking on more risk for those 31 days because I will be overweighted in ENPH.",

        "selftext": "I out some money on green energy at the end of last year just to realize Enph is going down non-stop. Some research suggests is due to microchips shortage, which makes sense and some further review suggests it has a 50/50 chance of recovery.\n\nThen I got my control number in the mail bc there'll be a vote. Is anyone here investing in Enph? I've reviews the documents and the Board recommendation seem to make sense but wanted to double check and have some discussions here about it. In case there's something going on behind the scenes I'm not aware about. (ie it's also being shorted or something)\n\nI'm all ears, cheers",

I hope you enjoy.\n\n# Overview \n\nThe era of clean energy is upon us and the timing couldn\u2019t be better to get behind Joe Biden\u2019s newly proposed [2.3 trillion dollar](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/us/politics/biden-climate-plan.html) clean energy infrastructure plan. Clean energy generation is about to ride some huge tailwinds as described by this article on Financial Times.\n\n\u201cBiden\u2019s plan would see an infusion of more than $350bn directly into clean energy driving electric-vehicle infrastructure, reinvigorating the grid and boosting research and development plus an estimated $400bn extending and expanding tax credits for clean energy generation and storage. It would also set a clean energy standard mandating utilities to produce power that is carbon-free by 2035.\u201d\n\n**Transition to Clean Energy, the Solar Industry, and Enphase**\n\nOne industry already seeing increased demand as the world shifts to clean energy is solar. In the last decade alone, solar has experienced an average annual growth rate of **42%** ([source](https://www.seia.org/solar-industry-research-data#:~:text=Solar%2520as%2520an%2520Economic%2520Engine,investment%2520in%2520the%2520American%2520economy.)). Solar is currently regarded as the cheapest source of energy in the history of the world, far surpassing coal and gas, as well as beat out wind and other renewables.\n\n*Processing img yygau7pkh3071...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet\u2019s talk about one of the biggest players currently dominating this industry, Enphase (ENPH). Enphase is the largest designer and manufacturer in the solar energy market selling micro-inverters for homes, installing solar panels onto their roofs, and currently capturing over 50% of the U.S market. Enphase\u2019s strategy revolves around four core pillars: new product development (innovating the micro-inverter), residential energy storage, commercial solar projects, and services platform.\n\nBy executing the strategies mentioned above they are expecting to increase their Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM) from $4.1 billion in 2020 to roughly \\~$14 billion in 2023. All of this is powered by organic growth and the new clean energy movement providing margins of roughly 40% which are worthy enough to write home about.\n\n**Setbacks**\n\nLike any industry or company, there will be some challenging obstacles to overcome. For Enphase, one of their biggest hurdles is the global semiconductor chip-shortage, which should give some headwinds until at least the end of 2021. The chip-shortage is not a new headline and has been plaguing many industries. On Enphase\u2019s recent earnings call management noted that although demand remains strong they can\u2019t fill orders because there isn\u2019t enough material for them to keep up with demand. However, these are short term headwinds and the global semiconductor chip shortage is not expected to continue forever. Thus, this represents an excellent buying opportunity for ENPH. In a RARE occurrence even Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, AND Barclays [all agreeing on one thing](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/28/enphase-posts-record-quarter-stock-slides-on-chip-shortage-pains.html) that was recommending buying the recent Enphase dip.\n\n\u201cThe silver lining is obvious to us: those looking to take the long-view on ENPH will correctly view this eventually transient headwind, as a buying opportunity on any weakness,\u201d noted Barclays, while Goldman said that \u201cdemand and margins remain robust.\u201d\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nEnphase\u2019s dominance in this industry has allowed them to capture a large piece of this ever-growing pie. Their flagship product is still innovating with each iteration while they expand commercial and residential offerings. Their SAM is expecting to grow exponentially over the next 5-10 years and ENPH is aggressively (and succeeding) trying to capture ever dollar of it. The stock has tumbled from all-time-highs, which leaves some breathing room for a good entry since their valuation has contracted.",

        "selftext": " Ok kids, listen up. A couple helpful posters keyed me into the fact that a certain hedge was shorting two stocks, so I went on a bit of a dig.\n\nI present to you Public Enemy #1 and #2.\n\nBlackstone Alternative Investment Funds\n\nand\n\nCutler Group LP (has a history of violations for naked shorts)\n\nBelow you will find the list of stocks I found them to be short on, and their last reported positions - which in most cases are 5/10 - yeah that's right, YESTERDAY. We know exactly what they've shorted, and we know exactly what to do, right?\n\n**We buy. We Hold. We win.**\n\nThese two hedgies are shorting almost every stock we hodl dear. They are trying to take our hard earned stimmies just because they can. These are some of the people who have driven us red the last month. These are the kind of people who think they can have my wife without her boyfriend present. Oh HELL no. Over my cold, dead tendies. \n\nBelow are Blackstone's positions. You will see Cutler on many of those, as well as on some others that Blackstone was not in.\n\nPLTR (5/10)\n\nLatest Disclosed Ownership-157,100 sharesLatest Disclosed Value$ -3,658,859\n\nRKT (5/10)\n\nLatest Disclosed Ownership-2,500 sharesLatest Disclosed Value$ -57,725\n\nAV LIDAR developer (5/10)\n\nLatest Disclosed Ownership-9,600 sharesLatest Disclosed Value$ -178,080\n\nvideo game store (3/1)\n\nLatest Disclosed Ownership-21,600 sharesLatest Disclosed Value$ -406,944\n\nBABA (5/10)\n\nLatest Disclosed Ownership-2,600 sharesLatest Disclosed Value$ -589,498\n\nASO (5/10)\n\nLatest Disclosed Ownership-3,700 sharesLatest Disclosed Value$ -99,863\n\nBAK (5/10)\n\nLatest Disclosed Ownership-100 sharesLatest Disclosed Value$ -1,422\n\nVIAC (5/10) (Melvin's shorting this too)\n\nLatest Disclosed Ownership-35,329 sharesLatest Disclosed Value$ -1,593,337\n\nENPH (5/10)\n\nLatest Disclosed Ownership-1,400 sharesLatest Disclosed Value$ -227,024\n\nCLNE (5/10)\n\nLatest Disclosed Ownership-39,000 sharesLatest Disclosed Value$ -535,860\n\nBE (5/10)\n\nLatest Disclosed Ownership-1,400 sharesLatest Disclosed Value$ -37,870\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditionally, there's a bonus in this list! \n\nAmong those precious stocks above is one that is primed for a gamma squeeze. \n\nThis stock is a small cap, so WSB can move the price.\n\nThis stock has significant short interest, which will assist in a gamma squeeze (it will not short squeeze, this is just an added little boost if it does gamma squeeze)\n\nThis stock has low average volume, meaning short positions will have higher DTC. This also means quicker and stronger price volatility.\n\nThis stock has been bent over hard and is currently at a bargain price well under any valuation you can find.\n\nThere are 4 million shares worth of options that will be ITM if the stock spikes. Average volume is 3.5m.\n\nI give you CLNE.\n\nIf you want DD on it, do your own. The play is simple. \n\n**Buy shares, Hold shares, Win tendies.**",
