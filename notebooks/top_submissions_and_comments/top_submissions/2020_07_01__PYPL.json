        "selftext": "**Setting the tone**  \nThis past February, the Federal Reserve released data that showed US consumers have racked up roughly $930 billion in credit card debt with total household debt surpassing $14 trillion. This unprecedented amount of credit card debt was surveyed at the peak of the longest bull market in our country\u2019s history. Now, roughly 4 months removed, I estimate that this figure is easily over $1.1-1.2 trillion dollars as incomes dissipate but household bills continue to mount. Released in conjunction with this report were the default rates\u2014the figures that indicate whether consumers can meet their current debt obligations. The overall rate of borrowers in delinquency was 5.32% in the fourth quarter. On the surface that may seem insignificant, but this level of default is the highest it has been in nearly a decade. This is largely attributable to two things: egregiously high interest rates and excessive borrowing.  \n  \n**Current Macroeconomic Conditions** \n  \nAs of mid July, it is estimated over 25 million Americans are relying on unemployment benefits to meet their monthly expenses as the pandemic lingers on. Most states have seen an increase in cases and in states such as New York, the reopening has made many jobs redundant.    \n  \n**Synchrony financial**    \n  \nSynchrony Financial is a leading lender in risky consumer credit cards. They bear the risk for Walmart, Home Depot, PayPal, J.C. Penney, Amazon, etc. The issue with these store credit cards is that those that apply for them generally are not well-off financially and Synchrony preys on the weak-credit. Speaking from observation, I have seen people need an emergency repair from Home Depot or clothes for their children--using the credit card as minimum payments are more affordable than a single lump sum.   \n  \nIn Synchrony's last 10Q, CECL (Current Expected Credit Losses) was increased 10 fold. However, I believe the provisions were not enough at the time. **July 21** Synchrony releases its Q2 10Q. I believe another revision will be made to increase the provision as the pandemic powers on.  \n  \n**How does this coincide with the Cares Act?**. \n  \nGlad you asked. The Cares Act, which was passed in early March, provided those on unemployment benefits with a supplementary $600. The last day people can claim it is July 26th and it is believed an extension will not be passed. The Cares Act had ultimately delayed the crash we all expected. With 25 million out of work for the foreseeable future, we can guarantee an uptick in foreclosures and delinquent credit accounts.   \n  \n**Synchrony is at direct risk of default**  \n  \nPoor credit/high approval, ATH delinquencies before pandemic, restricted use credit cards. These are the issues that are going to plague Synchrony's recovery. I ask you: Would you be more inclined to use your last $25 to pay your $25 statement balance on your Amex that can be used everywhere or your Home Depot card?   \n  \nI forgot to mention that Synchrony Financial also is the creditor behind CareCredit. Did I mention that we are experiencing a Pandemic? and that most Americans cannot afford their medical bills pre-COVID? Recipe for disaster.   \n  \nTLDR: Synchrony Financial is going to have a tough time unless the Cares Act gets extended over the next two weeks.   \n  \n**SYF 17P 9/18, SYF 15P 12/18**",

There is a clear divide between the \"new tech\" and the \"efficient tech\" type of companies though: the latter stocks expanded in valuations by a lot. The price to sales on some of them doubled. I'd approach these with caution - the market seems to be a little too exstatic about them, but on the other hand it seems like capital has nowhere else to go so I can't imagine the market abandoning the valuations anytime soon. \n\nOn the other hand the \"new tech\" stocks moved largerly side-ways with two outliers - HXL running into Covid19 trouble as an aerospace supplier and VRTX posting impressive earnings and continuing to execute well on their plan. All in all the valuations of these companies remained sensible in contrast to the \"efficient stocks\". While these should be the higher risk stocks, they seem now like a more reasonable investment.  \n\nLet's see what happens in one year!",

Look up your local auction house and spend an evening or day at the Auction. It is fun and will help you understand why previous CEO\u2019s tanked this awesome company with their stupidity. Hammering a Diamond into a square hole.\n\nWorked for an auction house 4 years. If you go to a well run local auction you will see diverse people,  successful auction houses have a customer makeup like this:\n\n30% Hustlers and People involved with the auctions (Consignees etc)\n\n20% Rich people (Rich people love auctions and I\u2019m not talking about Sotherbys I\u2019m talking about a normal sized city weekly auction there will be lots of rich people there)\n\n40% Normal people that either like the thrill or value seekers.\n\n10% Poor People.\n\nThis is important when we talk about bad CEO decisions.  You have to know your audience.\n\nEbay started out with this dude selling a broken laser printer, Pierre Omidayer. It grew quickly and he brought in professional help. This can be a good thing as founders can get in the way of growth. In 1998 Meg Whitman was hired to be CEO.  Her tenure was unimpressive and she was responsible for the first of two massive blunders that decapitated eBay growth.\n\nEbay was growing and the internet was starting to get widespread use. By the early 2000s people started to talk about WEB 2.0 and for some reason certain people thought that WEB 2.0 meant being fancy.  Ebay did a massive redesign that was hated by most people.  Broadband internet was in it\u2019s infancy and the focus on form over function was frustrating for low bandwidth users as the fanciness was more complicated and took longer to load.  Additionally it stunted the pathway that would eventually appear for mobile growth.  The remnants of this design linger today.\n\n[Screen Cap of the AOLfication of eBay](https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/gallery/ebay-2003) late 2003 I believe one of the big problems was rendering the menus in AJAX or something similar, very slow to load in that era\n\nHere we can see the failure in line graph form, (These things lag) eBay share price got hammered. One the reasons for the hammering was lackluster earnings, many ebay users attribute this to the redesign failure as it turned off existing and new customers.\n\n[Link to image as it loos like this sub doesn't allow embeded images](https://ibb.co/mX1ZQQK)\n\nProject Ugly-ify and Slow-ify eBay looks to have lopped off growth and momentum for the share price.  Meg Whitmans tenure at ebay neutered growth.\n\nOne could blame Whitman for doing a lot of damage to eBay growth but she will largely be forgotten after you learn about the FLAMING DUMPSTER FIRE OF A CEO that is John Donahoe.  In 2008 eBay hired Donahoe to be CEO.  This could possibly be the worst hire in the history of all hires.\n\nDon\u2019t take my word for it.  In 2014 Carl Icahn said eBay was the worst run company he had ever seen.\n\n[Carl Icahn says eBay is the worst run company he has ever seen](https://www.cnbc.com/2014/03/05/ebay-is-worst-run-company-i-have-ever-seen-carl-icahn.html)\n\nDonahoe had series after series of bad decision. He basically went to war with small and medium sellers (eBay\u2019s actual bread and butter customers) and went to great lengths to attract large corporate clients. (The worst type of business for eBay) and run away his most profitable customers. \n\neBay is a market place.\n\nDonahoe gave steep discounts in fees in order to attract corporate customers.\n\nCompanies like Target started to sell on eBays platform. (Most are now gone because within a few short years the internet was mature enough that they could start their own platforms)\n\n[Link to no longer existing eBay Target Store](http://cgi6.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewStoreV4&amp;name=targetstore&amp;_rdc=1)\n\nFee discounts to corporate customers angered existing sellers.\n\nIn early 2013 he implemented eBay\u2019s search algorithm (Cassini I believe it was called)  Previous to this Algo eBay was just a dumb search engine.  With the Algo, eBay could control visibility of items on the site via built in preferences like Best Match.  With this Donahoe is about to fire maybe 20% of his most profitable customers and give the Amazon marketplace a flood of new users.  This idiot was trying to turn an auction house into the next Amazon.  Instead he just put Amazon growth on steroids and shoots himself in the foot.\n\nCassini was used to ban eBay's customers. DROVES OF THEM\n\nDonahoe decided that any problems on eBay were caused by sellers and he declared war on the people that were his customers.\n\nEnter DSR.  Detailed seller ratings was eBay implementation of strict guidelines for their sellers. DSR = 4 categories, each category was rated 1-5 with 5 being good.  The system treated 1&amp;2s as a failure.\n\nFor Example Customer was unhappy with an item they received for whatever reason.  If someone rated a part of the transaction a 2 they would get a ding against their DSR.  Problem is they treated all categories the same and the thresholds were very stringent.\n\nFor every 1000 transactions a seller had to have LESS than 10 dings in order to participate with Cassini without a search penalty.  If the 10 threshold was crossed (Which is 98.9% or less good rating) they would be penalized in the search standing and go under probation.  If they crossed 20/1000 or 97.9% or less positive approval rating they would BAN YOU FROM THE PLATFORM.\n\nYOU READ THAT CORRECTLY John DONAHOE in is infinite wisdom decided that sellers with as high as a 97.9% positive transaction rating were disposable. I've NEVER SEEN SOMETHING SO STUPID IN MY LIFE.\n\nI kid you not. Donahoe implemented a system where a 98.9% POSITIVE rating has a penalty and 97.9% positive is a ban. (Check the feedback on tons of Amazon marketplace sellers and you will see how ridiculous a threshold this was) What was even more ridiculous was in the beginning all categories were treated the same. For example Books were treated the same way as used women's clothing. Certain categories like womens clothing were DECIMATED by sellers being banned.  People who had been on the platform for a decade and had say a 97% positive feedback selling USED WOMENS CLOTHING were banned left and right.  It gets worse, remember how at 98.9% they would put you on probation? Some people called this the DEATH SPIRAL as if you were on probation the new \u201cBest Match\u201d system would lower your search standing.  So if you were some poor schmuck who had sold 397 used pieces of womens clothing that year and just 4 of them were unhappy with the experience. You\u2019d go on probation with little to no hope of anything other than the ban hammer.  I\u2019ve read many period era messageboard posts of long time sellers in probation trying to do EVERYTHING they could to raise their DSR to get out of probation but had zero visibility with the new algo, they were just left to wither on the vine hoping fruitlessly to turn things around. Most of them didn\u2019t know it YET but eventually as people started putting the pieces together there was no chance of them escaping the Death Spiral. Gaggles of people spent MONTHS trying to save their accounts and eventually most of them realized they were screwed, there was nothing they could do about it because of the Algos.  These sellers turned on ebay and took others with them.\n\nIf you notice during this time period AMAZON marketplace took off. Daddy Bezo\u2019s had a flood of experienced online traders who simply shifted their operations to the less popular (at the time) and more expensive platform (at the time).  It was either that or close shop. MANY CHOSE TO CLOSE SHOP.\n\nThe stupidity of all this was the Small and Medium sellers were the real money makers. eBay charges around a 9% fee with a cap of $250 per transaction.\n\nWhich is more profitable?\n\nTarget selling 50,000 items or 5,000 small to medium size sellers selling 100 items?\n\nThe answer is in the nature of marketplaces.  Target sells to 5,000 customers and that is the end of the story. Small to medium sized sellers tend to keep the money in the marketplace.  User A sells to user B for $100 User B can turn around and take that $100 and buy something he needs for himself or his business from user C, user C can then do the same. Wash, Rinse, Repeat.  Target selling $100 is a one way street while Small to Medium users can be a continuous money carousel.\n\nDonahoe in his infinite ignorance ran off many of his prime sellers. Ultimately sellers are your customers as they are the one\u2019s who pay the fees. He jump started his competition whom he was stupidly trying to emulate.  The important thing to understand about eBay is their product (An Auction) is easily scaleable and cheap to run\n\n[For example this Rolex](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-1978-Rolex-MK4-Pepsi-1675-GMT-Maxi-Dial-/254628856737?epid=17038919251&amp;hash=item3b491003a1%3Ag%3AEQYAAOSwMyBe66VL&amp;LH_Auction=1&amp;nma=true&amp;si=TeM7ntP3DMfMhub%252FkeyT83ViFxA%253D&amp;orig_cvip=true&amp;nordt=true&amp;rt=nc&amp;_trksid=p2047675.l2557)\n\ncosts about the same to service this listing for a rug\n\n[The Target deal, illustrated with a bathroom rug](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Mod-Target-Accent-Rug/143641586716?hash=item2171b4ac1c%3Ag%3AKdUAAOSwAtZe2bvY&amp;LH_Auction=1)\n\nChasing these corporate dollars was infinitely stupid.\n\n1. They gave these corporations steep discounts to use the platform\n2. The internet was maturing and we were just a few years from all these corporations having their own web presence\n3. Robbed dollars and eyeballs from your bread and butter. Auction and Store listings of small to medium sellers.\n4. Robs future revenue from carousel customers who return money to the marketplace and gives it to corporate customers who do not return dollars and are using the dollars they make off you to build the infrastructure to replace you. DING DING DING\n\nThis dude declared war on some of his best customers and tried to make eBay an ugly corporate shill and would eventually lead to the invasion of cheap Chinese stuff (eBay is now combating that)\n\nWe can see the results of his war on customers with this graph. eBay\u2019s growth and revenue was decimated by this idiot and you can see the results once the earnings were reported  (Which lagged the implementation of his stupidity)\n\n[War on customers displayed via line graph](https://ibb.co/cQ3pPg9)\n\nDonohoe decapitated ebay right during what would have been it\u2019s prime growth years and funneled those customers to his biggest competitor.\n\neBay can make far more with less because of the nature of it\u2019s bread and butter customers. Many auction enthusiasts are high income types.  eBay has better demographics financially than it\u2019s competitors. There is even a fairly large industry of arbitrage where people sell items they source elsewhere (Like amazon) and basically drop ship them off as eBay sells because some stuff sells at a premium on eBay. \n\neBay CAN make more money per transaction compared to similar industries and can capture a significant amount of money to return within the marketplace. Similar to sales tax, that dollar can bounce around within the marketplace and eBay can take it\u2019s 9% cut every time it switches hands.\n\nInteresting side rabbit hole that arises during the Donahoe years.  Donahoe was obsessed with attacking his own customers.  This was commonly followed in an industry blog called AuctionWeb and then eventually named ecommercebytes.  Run by the Steiner Couple\n\n[Here is an article their website published about them getting rid of sellers](https://www.ecommercebytes.com/2013/11/06/suspended-ebay-sellers-suggest-widespread-purge/)\n\nThey reported on all of eBay\u2019s policy changes and basically called them out for being the giant window lickers they were.  It ruffled a few feathers within the organization and now 6+ employees of eBay are being charged with crimes like harassment and stalking.  Really a crazy story. DONAHOE is to blame for the policies and culture that allowed this to happen.  He should go to jail over just what he did to the share price.\n\n[Crazy eBay Criminal Stalking](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/06/18/brian-gilbert-santa-clara-police-ebay.html)\n\n[More Crazy eBay Harassment](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ebay-harassment-campaign-pig-cockroach-blog-11593009038)\n\nDuring all of this foot shooting was when Carl Icahn said that eBay was THE WORST RUN COMPANY HE HAD EVER SEEN\n\nOne of the problems was the incestuous nature of eBay\u2019s relationship with Paypal and the board members who presided over both.  They basically spent a decade doing what was best for the board and not what was best for the Shareholders, employees and customers of eBay.\n\nThis is now not so much a problem because many of those relationships no longer exist. In the aftermath the other pieces have found increased market value and eBay has been suppressed due to it being stuck with all the burdens of the Donahoe administration and bad perception.\n\neBay should have been worth more as an individual piece and it\u2019s was the one who took the financial hits.\n\nPayPal Split in 2015\n\nPayPal has a 113 P/E (I\u2019m not saying this is the best metric to judge a company I\u2019m just using it for illustration)\n\n[If eBay traded at Paypal P/E it would be worth $660](https://www.barrons.com/quote/stock/us/xnas/pypl)\n\nSo what\u2019s the catalyst to the eBay Rocket Ship that is about to take off?\n\nCORONA.  Corona is shaking up the whole economy and this shake up will jolt eBay to it\u2019s full potential.\n\n[Alexa 90 days, even better at 140 and this growth is against the normal ebb of seasonal business](https://ibb.co/HxSQfBb)\n\nOver the past 4 months as far as I can tell eBay has increased traffic by as much as 18%+ which is pretty AMAZING for a very mature internet company.  Even more amazing when you take into account that this is normally eBays slow period. Traffic is normally on the downturn. YOY I am curious how much busier they have been I'm guessing 45% YOY increase in traffic for the Month of May &amp; June\n\nApril May June July are eBay\u2019s 4 slowest months and the July 28th earnings will encompass 3 of those 4 months. During the slowest time of year eBay went from the mid 50\u2019s to the lower 40\u2019s for it\u2019s spot in total Internet Traffic. A HUGE shift against the normal tide of business cycles.\n\n[Traffic for last 90 days. Up much more over entire Corona Period](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/ebay.com) the increase looks more bigly when you view 150 days out\n\nI've spent a few hours trawling eBay seller message boards. Within this quarter I have heard of increases in per transactions and a decrease in \"Best Offers\" which means better margins for sellers and more fees for eBay. I attribute this to Corona disrupting normal supply chains. eBay has been established for many years so boomers when they can\u2019t find something are like \"Oh Yeah EBAY.\" Many sellers report increased sells in business related categories and more aged inventory being sold as parts of the market shift towards online from some of the traditionally Bricks and Mortar industries.  eBay has a very successful and well made app.  Sellers are seeing increased usage amongst younger buyers/sellers whom are either bored with the lockdowns or looking for side income after losing their jobs.  Remember when we mentioned 500 small sellers being worth more than one big corporate client?  This will be obtained with an army of people using the app on their cell phones.  Corona is going to get the attention of customers they lost over the years as they come back to the platform they remember, millennials and new users when they discover the well made app will come online. I've added the eBay App to my phone it is very good and has very customizable search features. \n\nThe Bear case for eBay is even more, if Corona turns out to be worse (It\u2019s not) everything online just becomes more valuable.\n\nSo what is eBay worth?\n\nWell it\u2019s a better investment IMO than Paypal\n\n[eBay valued like Paypal is worth $660](https://www.barrons.com/quote/stock/us/xnas/pypl)\n\nMercardo Libre is worth more than eBay (This is a Crime) as it is not even a top 1000 worldwide website while eBay is top 50. Plus it doesn\u2019t even turn a profit.  If you have any MELI stock sell half of it and buy eBay in addition to whatever you would buy if you didn't own MELI do the same for PayPal as well IMO.\n\n[If eBay was valued like MELI it would be worth Tesla numbers](https://www.barrons.com/quote/stock/us/xnas/meli?mod=DNH_S)\n\nMercardo Libre has a 25% bigger market cap than eBay and doesn\u2019t turn a profit. Ebay would be $76 a share just to be on par with MELI and it shouldn\u2019t even be in the same ballpark.\n\nEtsy is just outside of the Top 100 for web traffic and has a 181 P/E if eBay was trading like ETSY it would be trading at $1090 a share\n\n[If eBay was valued like ETSY it would trade for $1090](https://www.barrons.com/quote/stock/us/xnas/etsy)\n\nChannel Advisor is a company that grew out of offering services for eBay and while it works on multiple platforms it\u2019s use was born from eBay and it has a 60 P/E\n\n[If trading like Channel Advisor it would be worth $363](https://www.barrons.com/quote/stock/us/xnys/ecom?mod=DNH_S)\n\nCorona shifted a lot of users to the eBay marketplace because of busted supply chains.  They now have an Okay website and an EXCELLENT APP.  This increased use comes during the traditional low tide of eBay traffic and if eBay leans into the coming quarters their revenue is going to skyrocket. Corona was the catalysts to wake everybody up to what eBay could do and what it should be worth. EBAY should be one of the most profitable companies in the US economy with lots of room to improve the bottom line. It has all the pieces.\n\nLike\n\nSelling off some of the MANY side projects under the eBay umbrella\n\nStreamlining Employment\n\nJust this month they are integrating their own payment platform which should add 1-2% more to every sell which is a big deal considering that the average fee is around 9%. We are talking about maybe 20% added to revenue with not much changing. BIG MONEY\n\nWinning back Small to Medium sellers and improving the per item transaction is eBay's ticket to tendie town. All the new growth they are experiencing is exactly what they need and want. They have a good App that can capitalize on the reboot.\n\neBay has ample room for growth and I suspect the income levels of buyers in the marketplace is higher than competitors like Amazon, Etsy, Overstock, Stitch Fix.  eBaY has more people with money paying attention.\n\nNew CEO seems to be a bright guy.  All he has to do is not SHOOT HIMSELF IN THE FOOT like the Donahoe CEO.   If successful eBay will be on the moon mission of all moon missions\n\nMOST UNDERVALUED TECH COMPANY IN AMERICA. As always my DMs are open and I do mercenary stuff. I have my position and I am currently buying shares with a goal of 303 shares before earnings.\n\nI suspect this thing will have VERY little resistance upon takeoff\n\n[Little Resistance](https://ibb.co/Y2k67xX)\n\nBUY 11 \u2013 101 \u2013 1001 Shares Depending on Bankroll (I like shares on this one, I like the company and I'm expecting dividends) Once this rocket settles it is covered call selling time. (This is why you want multiples of 100\n\nYou should be at least a 80/20 Options/ Share split. Got to water the seed\n\nOptions\n\n7/31 $80C\n\n(8/21 $90C if ever made available)\n\n1/15/21 $85C   (Also I'd buy higher but they are not currently available, if BEFORE earnings Higher Strikes appear I would go up in strike A LOT. If earnings are up big this is ONLY THE BEGINNING as this is eBays SLOW PERIOD. Earnings for the fall will be CRAZY if Traffic continues to hold and if it has the normal Santa Claus Tax increase \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "Hi, this was a comment of mine on another thread here and I just thought I wanted to share it as a post and maybe if some people from another country that's not the US and want to be able to trade US stock/options, feel free to dm me and I'll give you some tips on how I got my TD account running. If this is wrong, please feel free to delete my post but don't ban me :(((\n\n\nI'm 21 from Vietnam and our money has little value, 500usd is like average monthly salary here. It's pretty hard to access US stock trading from where I'm from. I got a TDA account, they allow foreign account, then ask a friend of mine in the US to fund it and I send him money over Paypal or Transferwise. My countries doesn't even allow bank wire to fund international investing. \n\n\nI started in Feb with the SPCE crazed, missed TSLA, MSFT due to TDA handling my account creation a bit too long (was my fault at first but their handling was the main problem). Proceed to make big with SPCE in a week, I turn 2k into 6k and it was amazing, that's like a year of salary for an average person here and still being in uni that was a dream for me. I work pretty hard to make money here, part time and trying to open my own company and making 6k in such a short amount of time was crazy. \n\n\nI did spent a few years learning before I was 18 (to be allowed to create an account). Wanted to get in heavy on AMD when they were sub 2 (I study Computer Engineer and love PC so I kinda felt how big Ryzen was) but didn't have the chance. \n\n\nSo after SPCE was around Feb 20 and the market started crashing, lost a lot to sub 1k then I moved to SPY put and made back to 3k.\n\n\nThen lost a bunch on The Witching. Down to 300 and proceed to lose them with put when market shoot back up. Finally some friend decided they wanna give it a go and invest some money with me trading and he'll just watch.\n\nHaving learnt a bunch from my past experience, I managed to turn his 500 into 4000 with pennystock and I get to keep 2000 which was back to even. Took a lot of good risk management and making multiple small smart play.\n\n\nThat was a month ago, now I'm down to 800 but I'm feeling like I'm getting a lot better compares to when I start.\n\n\nMost of the lost was due to lack of day trading with penny stock and some momentum options play gone wrong.\n\n\nMy biggest mistake and biggest gainer was both due to going too big on a position. I'm learning to control that.\n\n\nAnw, that was a long rant, I never really share these things since there's no one around me that I can talk about this. All I hear people say is that I'm gambling, which might seems like it looking at my history but I kinda think it's justified right now due to never before seen volatility.\n\n\nI learnt a lot and feel excited for my trading future but man the losses take their tolls. Probably gonna finish uni next year and try to get my company of the ground while doing small investing. Learning about the market, news and general financial, business helped me a lot with my career I feel.\n\n\nHope this somehow answer your question and good luck to us all. At the end of the day I just want everyone to live more comfortably with their side income and seeing the loss porn might be hilarious but there's always a person behind those loss as well as their family. It's fine if you lose 100k while sitting on millions but man some adults just scares me and I'm grateful to learn from their mistakes.\n\n\nI want to make 25k before the end of next year so I can day trade. Just making 100 usd a day would allow me to fund my company and let my parents retire soon especially during this harsh Covid time. \n\n\nVietnam was free of covid for a month or two but just yesterday we have emergency news that a case popped up and spread.\n\n\nSorry for my long rant, hope you all enjoy your weekend and get those tendies next week. Sorry for my bad English :)",

I have 8 years working in a manufacturing, fintech, and education policy. My economic research and model largely revolves around increasing Mexican-American trade after USMCA changes and I write around organizations that will be affected by Mexican development and American innovation. I write extensively because I love to teach online, debate, and learn a few things myself in the process.\n\n* Digital Transactions\n* Cybersecurity\n* Cross-border Trade\n* Agricultural Technology\n* Manufacturing support\n* Labor laws &amp; IP/data protection\n\nSome of these picks are abundantly clear. For example:\n\n1. Nucor Steel will see operations grow\n2. Kansas City Southern Rail is a critical supply chain element\n3. Paypal and Square will continue to build financial services in underbanked nations like Mexico.\n4. Cloudflare will offer unbelievably inexpensive cybersecurity and networking support\n5. Texas Instruments will build advanced manufacturing technology based on computer vision\n6. **Dropbox will continue to expand tooling in academia, camera and signature solutions, and data storage in an era of advanced data collection &amp; computing.**\n7. Institutions and financieers are investing in logistics and data center real estate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# DBX 24-26c 8/21\n\n# DBX 24c 9/18\n\n[https://assets-global.website-files.com/580ea75512564ed05c3a8455/5bfc62c5aca97fa17998085e\\_dropbox-blog-image-1434x590.jpg](https://assets-global.website-files.com/580ea75512564ed05c3a8455/5bfc62c5aca97fa17998085e_dropbox-blog-image-1434x590.jpg)\n\n# # My Belief\n\n**Dropbox is in the right place at the right time, much like a recycled cardboard boxing company is in logistics.** Cloud computing is complex and Big Tech will antitrust and decoupling pressures as time goes on. These companies are not stupid and are able to survive the change by decentralizing and consolidating over time. Telecom, oil, and other industries have done this in the past. However, this is probably the weakest factor in Dropbox's position.\n\nThe simple truth is that the marketshare of files and file processing is fucking huge and it's possible to grow at a respectable rate despite the fact that iCloud, Google Drive, and AWS S3 exists.  There are banking, manufacturing, and other data processors that require this shit and it's the same reason you're seeing organizations like ZScaler grow.\n\n* Adobe has a strong grasp on video, animated, and drawn files\n* Dropbox blessed legions of academics with window-mac file problems\n* Microsoft has made an enormous change by acquiring software engineering files via Github and NPM, which leverages them further into software automation with Softomotive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;*We focus particularly on the use cases that are complementary. And we see ourselves as playing an important role in terms of taking a couple steps back and making sure the overall experience is coherent. More than we're trying to engage in a dogfight with any particular tool or facet of the experience.* \\- Dropbox CEO\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oodnkwv4q5c51.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd6c45b7abd0d7db7b89d6540896cb40e218abd0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6aqbxas5q5c51.jpg?width=2716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da9655de09d81bba1c11d14a6b71a7b94b05c591\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pinsndv6q5c51.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1d162b2f7b72a356b86a8ed6be5365c21a0de83\n\nI actually view Dropbox closer to Adobe and DocuSign, but much more of a longterm cloud infrastructure layer rather than a sexy app that enhances the experience of using devices like iPad Pros and such.\n\nYou can do a lot of cool shit with files and I'm sure that the leadership behind DropBox is highly cognizant of the possibilities behind legal software, contract security, signature software, transactions, and other critical supply chain elements like academic management, IT support, and a financially robust competitor that institutions are happy to purchase stake in. This is file tooling and it's a big fucking industry that will be empowered by AI, computer vision, data processing, and the real estate of large data centers.\n\nIm making this over simplified, but the IT world is structured in layers. This extends from your router to your internet provider's telecommunication. You can imagine that organizations like Cloudflare &amp; Dropbox exist in separate layers under the same idea.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p8np7stlg5c51.png?width=3518&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc38df1402a4220c8beccdeb3d467bf27847b3e9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8tso1caia5c51.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98513757632de2d7900842a2ace2951be58c7360\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2401iz3oa5c51.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a697cbc38f89c84c7150c7fc8102778a6f3bb14\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p47zwp8os5c51.png?width=1047&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=486885d26d0b1122738df569e2accae89bc5ce22\n\n# # Why Dropbox?\n\nIn short, DropBox is wildly popular among\n\n\\- Academics\n\n\\- Accountants\n\n\\- HR teams\n\n\\- Deep Technology relationships over the past decade (early Spotify, startups, app integrations)\n\n\\- Anyone that has to deal with a fuck ton of files all of the time.\n\nDropbox is very similar to Cloudflare. It has taken years of careful development, relationship building, and investor confidence before going public on a highly distributed, robust, and cost effective technology for both Enterprise and SMB level users.

        "selftext": "Welcome to my Ted Talk\n\nIts become more evident lately that the term \u201cpriced in\u201d isn\u2019t understood by everyone. I\u2019m going to attempt to explain what this means for newer investors and use some real-world examples to illustrate my points.\n\nFirst off, what exactly does it mean when people say, \u201cIt\u2019s priced in the stock already?\u201d\n\nIn simplest terms, \u201cpriced in\u201d means that an expected outcome is already reflected in a stocks price / market cap.\n\nFor example, in a recent post of mine about [$PYPL](https://www.reddit.com/r/Undervalued/comments/hnw836/pypl_undervalued_or_a_growth_stock/) it was pointed out in the comments that eBay will stop using PayPal as their back-end payments processor. I replied saying this split was priced in. This is a clear example of something \u201cpriced in\u201d. When the news broke years ago the share price of $PYPL dropped which reflected the loss of this partnership. When the actually split occurs the impact on share price will be minimal to non-existent. \n\nAnother example, and a bit more complicated this time deals with [$GPS](https://www.reddit.com/r/Undervalued/comments/hgt9zf/yeezy_gap_gps_another_update/). Recently Kanye West\u2019s Yeezy brand signed an apparel deal with $GPS. Immediately $GPS rallied despite the fact that Yeezy apparel won\u2019t start selling for roughly a year. In a year when sales begin, if sales are in line with current estimates then in theory there will be minimal change to the share price as the expected sales figures are \u201cpriced in.\u201d However, what makes this case more complicated is the fact that future sales numbers are just estimates. A miss in either direction could, and most likely will result in a more significant swing in share price. \n\nFinally, in the most extreme example, let\u2019s look at the airlines. You see almost daily people saying COVID-19\u2019s impact on the travel industry is priced in. This statement is a fallacy since the true impact and longevity of the novel virus is unknown. If coronavirus subsides in the latter half of the year with the introduction of a vaccine then saying COVID-19 is priced in may be factually accurate. As airlines have bounced off their March lows it\u2019s been based on the assumption that air travel will resume later this year. However, if COVID-19 worsens with a second wave and lasts well into next year we\u2019ll likely see a significant decline in airline share prices. The unknown aspect of the virus makes the \u201cpriced in\u201d nature of the virus unknown. \n\nHopefully this quick write-up clears up some confusion regarding these terms and helps educate some of the new investors.\n\nThank you for attending my Ted Talk",

It's a rapidly growing product that I believe will protect interests as Latin America develops. I believe that their development of privacy-focused serverless computing and video streaming infrastructure was what was necessary for it to experience enormous growth in the next few years.\n\n [https://blog.cloudflare.com/scaling-the-cloudflare-global/](https://blog.cloudflare.com/scaling-the-cloudflare-global/) \n\n\\- **Corteva - AGRICULTURE BIOTECH**\n\nCorteva is a powerfully focused agritech investment. They have deep investments in corn, which is an enormous product that will always persist in Mexico and US agriculture.\n\n [https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/united-states-mexico-canada-agreement/fact-sheets/strengthening](https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/united-states-mexico-canada-agreement/fact-sheets/strengthening) \n\n\\- **Facebook - E-COMMERCE**\n\nI believe Facebook will play a really interesting role with Canada's Shopify in Latin America. WhatsApp is enormously popular in Mexico due to Facebook's networking investments, making it cheap to use. WhatsApp is better suited for Mexico's barter style economy, while Instagram seems to serve America's ad-centric transactions better. I believe we will be seeing Facebook develop deep business support with Shopify that is easy to use for billions of people across different economies.  Some of the technology is actually faschinating, as you can purchase products and test products using filters and 1-swipe purchases.\n\n [https://www.facebook.com/business/shops](https://www.facebook.com/business/shops) \n\n**- Kansas City Southern - US-MEXICAN RAIL**\n\nKansas City Southern is an extremely important trade vector between Mexico and the US. In particular, Texas and Monterrey. It's well diversified to deliver at a cost effective rate between changes in agriculture, energy, automotive, machining, food, and more.\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/54480/000005448016000143/wf\\_colorkcssystemmap2015a01.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/54480/000005448016000143/wf_colorkcssystemmap2015a01.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Adobe - GRAPHICS**\n\nI'm completely impressed by Adobe's growth and acquisitions across multiple sectors. I believe Adobe is a great longterm AR play as it maintains a close relationship with Apple, develops software for video games, movies, digital signatures, and e-commerce, architecture, design, and an endless array of other software solutions.\n\n [https://theblog.adobe.com/adobe-acquires-allegorithmic-substance-3d-gaming/](https://theblog.adobe.com/adobe-acquires-allegorithmic-substance-3d-gaming/) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Paypal - FINANCIAL ACCESS**\n\nPaypal is interesting in regards to US-Mexico.Paypal has always demonstrated itself as a pioneer. It's very easy to send remittance money through Xoom. It's easy to send money to your friends via Venmo. Their credit system is awfully fair, which is helpful in a nation like Mexico that's critically underbanked. \n\nThey also had an excellent acquisition with Honey. I believe they'll be generating billions through their transactions on Amazon and other industries and will force fintech to rethink how far financial technology can go.\n\n [https://www.zdnet.com/article/paypal-acquires-honey-science-for-4-billion-adds-offers-deals-to-payment-network/#:\\~:text=Dan%20Schulman%2C%20CEO%20of%20PayPal,monthly%20active%20users%20in%20October.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/paypal-acquires-honey-science-for-4-billion-adds-offers-deals-to-payment-network/#:~:text=Dan%20Schulman%2C%20CEO%20of%20PayPal,monthly%20active%20users%20in%20October.) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Texas Instruments  - EMBEDDED SYSTEMS**\n\nI've selected for TI over AMD and Nvidia  since TI has a greater distribution. You'll find TI in automobiles, space rockets, airplanes, CNCs, school calculators, concrete producers, and so on.  Either way, AMD is listed below as a supplement to an already cloud-heavy setup.\n\n [https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/02/24/texas-instruments-incorporated-stock-in-4-charts.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/02/24/texas-instruments-incorporated-stock-in-4-charts.aspx) \n\n\\- **Teradyne - SYSTEMS TESTING &amp; INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION**\n\nTeradyne is part of the COVID restructure. I believe networking hardware chips are only  going to be more needed as an economic driver. Teradyne has an excellent client base regarding that and also develops and impressive amount of industrial automation robots across warehouses, farms, and so on. The future is inevitably automation, and this is my participation in that.\n\n [https://www.universal-robots.com/about-universal-robots/news-centre/teradyne-inc-acquires-universal-robots/](https://www.universal-robots.com/about-universal-robots/news-centre/teradyne-inc-acquires-universal-robots/) \n\n\\- **Microsoft - SOFTWARE AUTOMATION**\n\nI'm really excited to see Microsoft's future in software automation and services. They have a really interesting position with regards to gaming, cloud computing, and wonderful acquisitions for Github &amp; NPM and an array of other tools that can perform intensive software automation.\n\n [https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-acquires-softomotive-to-expand-low-code-robotic-process-automation-capabilities-in-microsoft-power-automate/](https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-acquires-softomotive-to-expand-low-code-robotic-process-automation-capabilities-in-microsoft-power-automate/) \n\n\\- **Costco - QUALITY CONSUMER GOODS**\n\nCostco has an excellent selection process that can be replicated across multiple cultures. The business pays their customers well which in turn results in supreme customer service and care.\n\n [https://futurefuel.io/employee-benefits/costco-careers/](https://futurefuel.io/employee-benefits/costco-careers/) \n\n\\- **Berkshire.B - QUALITY BUSINESSES**\n\nBerkshire.B is selected for similar reasons to Costco. I'm excited for Abel's leadership in the 21st century and they're simply an elegant long term investment with respects to quality business selection.\n\n [https://finance.yahoo.com/u/yahoo-finance/watchlists/the-berkshire-hathaway-portfolio](https://finance.yahoo.com/u/yahoo-finance/watchlists/the-berkshire-hathaway-portfolio) \n\n\\- **XLB Materials ETF - PROCESS ENGINEERING**\n\nXLB has an excellent selection of dominant businesses with respects to their industry like Sherwin-Williams, Linde PLC, and Ecolab.\n\n [https://www.sectorspdr.com/sectorspdr/sector/xlb/holdings](https://www.sectorspdr.com/sectorspdr/sector/xlb/holdings) \n\n\\- **Tesla - FUTURE MANUFACTURING**\n\nTesla is interesting as it develops robust applications and development of EV batteries, battery solutions, industrial automation and is helmed by a person who is able to mine engineering resources and relationships from SpaceX.\n\n [https://electrek.co/2020/06/17/tesla-new-deal-panasonic-battery-supply/](https://electrek.co/2020/06/17/tesla-new-deal-panasonic-battery-supply/) \n\n\\- **AMD - COMPUTING ACCESSIBILITY**\n\nI feel that the name of the game for AMD is the ability to reduce energy costs and low the cost of computing. They have been excelling at this for years now and I believe this patience will pay off enormously as AMD conquers the maintenance of data centers around the world.\n\n [https://blog.cloudflare.com/technical-details-of-why-cloudflare-chose-amd-epyc-for-gen-x-servers/](https://blog.cloudflare.com/technical-details-of-why-cloudflare-chose-amd-epyc-for-gen-x-servers/)",

        "selftext": "The Bet: I believe MVIS Microvison will be either 5 dollars per share or have been bought out at a price higher than 5 dollars per share by the last day in August.\n\nThe wager: if I am wrong I will send the first     25 people who PM me their paypal account the value of 1 share of MVIS of whatever the value is on the last trading day in August. (It will be under 5 dollars in this scenario).\n\nIf I am right, and the price per share is over 5 dollars or the stock has been bought out for an amount more than that I will send the first 25 people who DM 10 dollars because in this scenario I have made a ton of money and happy to share the wealth. \n\nSo there you go guys a sure win bet not even this sub can lose. \n\nJust DM with the word \"bet\"  with your PayPal email in the text and I will know. \n\nIf I do not follow through by Sept 5 and have paid out to the top 25 that DM me ban me scorn me do whatever.\n\nOnce I get 25 I will update this to show all bets have been made and I will try to reply to anyone that didn't make it but if and when this hits big I may send it to you anyway for good karma or some shit. \n\nPlace your bets!\n\nEdit: August 2020 because I am not a shit bag.\n\nEdit 2: new wrinkle, if some how stock price is under 1 dollar by end of August 2020 everyone gets paid!!! Not just first 25. And that is if the price per share is 99 cents and below you will receive the value of 1 share if it is under 1 dollar.\n\nEdit 3: as of 11:34 EST on 3 July, 6 bets are in!\n\nEdit 4: as of 11:52 EST on 3 July, 14 bets are in!\n\nIt isn't too late, and even if you aren't in top 25 everyone can win if price drops under a dollar by then, this scenario would suck because not only have I lost big time in my investments but I now owe everyone and I have to type decimals in to PayPal and that would also suck.\n\nEdit 5: up to 17. Please direct chat me so it is all in one place please.\n\nEdit 6: 20 in the books but you have to send \"bet\" and your PayPal email to be locked in.\n\nEdit 7: 22 but 2 of you didn't send PayPal so technically 5 spots still open, but remember everyone can still enter for the bonus under a dollar round.",

        "selftext": "Just over a month ago, when I [highlighted the Broadway Federal bank](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/hbdgc4/historically_black_broadway_federal_bank_byfc_in/), and its ongoing takeover fight, I thought that once the price spiked, and Sugarman was effectively \"paid off\" to go away, that the stock might retreat into obscurity.\n\nBut circumstances and investor consciousness has been steadily moving forward.\n\nAccording to Robintrack, over 16,000 individual accounts just on Robinhood continue to hold $BYFC. \n\nWhile it has retreated recently to as low as 1.83 (as of this posting, back to 1.85), that's still significantly higher than it was a month ago, when I first started writing about it.\n\nAnd it should go back up again soon, as its earnings are reported next week.\n\n## Upcoming Earnings &amp; Forecasts\n\nThough not yet announced, BYFC is expected to report earnings either on August 7 or August 10. (Will update once the announcement is made.)\n\nLast quarter, the [company reported its 10Q on May 11](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001171/000110465920062384/0001104659-20-062384-index.htm), covering the quarter to March 31 -- before the pandemic got into full swing.\n\nFollowing the CARES Act, passed on March 27-- with its $1200 \"rebate\" and additional weekly $600 unemployment benefit-- deposits at banks along with [savings rates have skyrocketed](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/29/us-savings-rate-hits-record-33percent-as-coronavirus-causes-americans-to-stockpile-cash-curb-spending.html). Last month, it was noted that \"[U.S. banks are \u2018swimming in money\u2019 as deposits increase by $2 trillion amid the coronavirus](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/21/banks-have-grown-by-2-trillion-in-deposits-since-coronavirus-first-hit.html).\"\n\nEven before the end of March, BYFC reported assets of $506M, a huge increase over the $440M it held at the end of December. Deposits had increased from $298M to $333M (nearly 12%) in that three months, too. \n\nIt also reported a small \"loss\" of $33,000 -- due in part to increased compensation (+$174,000 over the previous year) and the end of a $233,000 grant from Treasury Department's Community Development Financial Institution (\u201cCDFI\u201d) Fund. \n\nThose numbers should actually improve, under the pandemic, as the bank's budgets have been tightened.\n\nNote also that revolving loans (i.e. credit cards, personal loans and HELOCs) have been [paid down in record numbers](https://www.forbes.com/sites/advisor/2020/07/17/credit-card-debt-is-down-during-covid-19-heres-why/#340709f73a18) -- falling to the lowest levels since 2011. Longer term loans, like mortgages which benefit the bank, have actually increased.\n\nWhat may offset any gains is how much of a set-aside provision Broadway Federal makes for \"bad loans\" -- something that larger banks have been dealing with.\n\nAt its June 24 Annual Shareholder's Meeting, CEO Wayne-Kent [gave a presentation about BYFC's loan default rate and growth strategies](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001171/000110465920077540/tm2023468d2_ex99-1.htm) -- which I recommend anyone interested to take a look at.\n\nHe revealed that as of May 31, the bank had **only one loan delinquency**, an old church loan of less than $600k.\n\nAnd \"non-performing\" assets accounted for just **0.06% of its total assets.**\n\n##Investment in black community\n\nStarting from black billionaire [Robert Smith's](https://twitter.com/RFS_Vista) plan for a [reparative \"2% Solution\"](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2020/06/19/the-2-solution-inside-billionaire-robert-smiths-bold-plan-to-funnel-billions-to-americas-black-owned-businesses/) -- to invest more into minority owned and run business and financial institutions. According to the Forbes article,\n&gt;He figured just 2% of that would amount to $19.4 billion, which could be used to fund the core Tier 1 capital of **community development banks and minority depository institutions that primarily service Black communities.**\n\nThis has led to [billions being pledged by corporations](https://lafocusnewspaper.com/george-floyd-death-and-protests-spark-billions-in-corporate-giving/) to minority causes and businesses and financial institutions.\n\nLast month, widely reported was [Netflix's announcement](https://www.marketplace.org/2020/06/30/netflix-to-deposit-100-million-in-black-owned-banks/) that it would be shifting 2%, at least $100M, of its banking to minority institutions -- which was just a start.\n\nLess covered was [Google's announcement that it would be investing $175M in black businesses](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/17/google-will-commit-175-million-to-black-businesses-diversify-leaders.html), noting \"$50 million will go toward financing and grants for small businesses, focused on the Black community. $100 million will go toward funding participation in Black-led capital firms, startups and organizations supporting Black entrepreneurs.\"\n\nLikewise, less mentioned was PayPal's investment: \"It will kick out $530 million to Black-owned businesses and newly established proprietors through its \u201cPayPal Equity Investment for Underrepresented Minority-led Startups and Investment Funds\u201d program.\"\n\nAnd where will all that money have to be kept and funneled through? Banks, of course.\n\n## Broadway's role &amp; location\n\nConsider that Broadway Financial is the *only* remaining traditionally black community oriented bank headquartered on the West Coast -- and it's right in the heart of Los Angeles: two branches in LA, and one in Inglewood.\n\n[Broadway Federal's Mid-Wilshire location](https://goo.gl/maps/ujhijr8S9kMFvxjh7) is a little over a mile away from the famed Park La Brea, The Grove and about 2.5miles from Paramount Studios.\n\nThink about all the Hollywood \"liberal elite\" (to use the derogatory) and how they might want to demonstrate support for minority-oriented businesses.\n\nBroadway has one competitor in the region: privately held OneUnited Bank, based in Boston, which has had a single branch in Los Angeles at a less desirable location, 3683 Crenshaw Blvd for years.\n\n## Ongoing #BankBlack Promotions\n\nSince 2017, the [\"#BankBlack\" movement](https://bankblackusa.org/banks/) has been promoting investment and banking with the remaining minority community banks like Broadway. This has only increased in the last month, since the BLM rallies and protests have raised awareness.\n\nLast week, web site The Undefeated covered the [trend of black celebrities and musicians depositing at black community banks](https://theundefeated.com/features/stars-support-their-communities-by-investing-in-minority-owned-banks/)\n\nAnd the [MightyDeposits.com ranked Broadway Federal Bank](https://mightydeposits.com/search-banks#/search?cause=black_american&amp;page=1&amp;sort=community_financing) **the highest in the nation among minority oriented banks for community investment.**",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 27th, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings and fiscal debate could be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/24/here-comes-one-of-the-newsiest-and-most-critical-weeks-of-the-summer-for-markets.html)**\n*****\n&gt; In a summer of unending news, we may be heading into what could be the newsiest week of all.\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq\u2019s sputtering rally could be put to its biggest test yet, as tech bellwether Apple and other stalwarts of the tech rally report earnings. Early in the week, Republicans will unveil their stimulus package proposal, which will then be debated as Friday\u2019s deadline nears for the expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits.\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve also meets on and is likely to discuss other steps it can take. It\u2019s not likely, however, to make any moves as it wraps up on Wednesday, other than to assure markets it will continue to use extraordinary programs to help the economy.\n*****\n&gt; Then on Thursday, the government will release a big number many investors have been dreading \u2014 the first official reading of second quarter gross domestic product, which which should show how hard the economy crashed when it was abruptly shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect a contraction of about 35% in the second quarter, followed by a bounce back in the third quarter. But the size of that comeback could be directly impacted by how much stimulus Congress gives the economy, and how much the coronavirus continues to impact businesses and economic activity.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think there\u2019s a clear understanding of how much the economy has leaned on the crutch of government stimulus, both fiscally and monetarily,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group. \u201cEveryone will be watching for what will replace the $600 a week, and that will be the most important component of whatever plan they come up with.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The $600 weekly payment to about 30 million unemployed Americans expires Friday, and it is unlikely Congress will have a plan before that date. Strategists expect the amount to be cut in half, and Boockvar said the amount of that payment will directly impact the size of the boost to the economy\n*****\n&gt; The stimulus and tech earnings could both be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat the package looks like will be a huge deal, particularly on the unemployment benefits side, and whether tech companies can exceed the bar,\u201d said Boockvar. \u201cThat\u2019s very hard for them right now. So if they miss, does that mean it\u2019s going to be a negative for tech and not the whole market? Are we going to keep rotating to value from growth because tech has been so dominant it could take everything down?\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Earnings for the S&amp;P 500 companies are expected to decline by 40.3% for the second quarter, based on the results of companies that have already reported and estimates, according to Refinifiv\u2019s I/B/E/S. Technology earnings are expected to have one of the smallest profit declines, at just 4.4% on average.\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq, which had rallied to record highs this summer, ended lower for a second week, while the Dow and S&amp;P 500 were higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe earnings numbers overall, they\u2019ve been pretty good. It\u2019s just the basic problem with the stock market right now is that valuations are still pretty high,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cOther parts of the market that maybe look cheap on a price-to-book basis, their earnings have been hit. In the case of certain retailers, airlines, you have to worry about when their business is going to come back, if ever.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; About 80% of the companies already reporting have beaten Wall Street estimates. That is well above the average beat rate of about 65%, since 1994.\n*****\n&gt; Dozens of major companies report in the coming week, including Facebook on Wednesday and Alphabet and Amazon on Thursday. Pharmaceuticals Merck, Pfizer and Eli Lilly are expected to report, and consumer products names Starbucks, McDonald\u2019s and Procter &amp; Gamble also release results. Big oil, Exxon Mobil and Chevron report Friday.\n*****\n&gt; # Stimulus from Congress and the Fed\n&gt; Strategists expect Congress to ultimately adopt a new stimulus package of between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, but after the GOP plan is introduced it will have to be squared with Democrats\u2019 proposals. The House has its own $3 trillion spending plan. It is unlikely an agreement can be approved before unemployment benefits expire Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBipartisan negotiations between the White House, House, and Senate are officially underway, but we expect brinkmanship before passage. Trump administration officials also diverge on their expectations on timing, which remains optimistically by the end of July, and possibly stretching into August under the more \u2018realistic\u2019 case,\u201d writes Ed Mills, policy strategist at Raymond James.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Mills expects the $600 weekly payment to be cut to $300 or $400, and he said it\u2019s possible there would be more funds given to a Payroll Protection Program, to help small businesses.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOverall, momentum is building for the next package and the final price tag is arguably moving up (closer to $1.5 -2 trillion),\u201d Mills noted. Congress has already allocated $2.4 trillion in prior spending.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed will be discussing its own stimulus, and some economists expect it could again be talking about new tactics to keep interest rates low. One idea is a policy of forward guidance, where the Fed would steer market expectations more explicitly. Another is the Fed would use targeted Treasury purchases to control specific interest rates. But no new programs are expected to be announced.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey pretty much told us, they\u2019re all in. They told us they\u2019re willing to do whatever else it takes,\u201d said Keon. \u201cThe Fed is not going to be our problem. The Fed just told us they\u2019re going to do anything they can do to soften the blow from the virus.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/rshk3gVX/finvizmaps1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/y6nsD6FQ/marketdata3.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.postimg.cc/nrVx3NtG/finvizfuts1.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/NLhf0Rdn/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/gJmb01rb/marketdata1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/vBhFxX6g/spxsectors1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/Jn6YWFkq/marketpullbacklevels1.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/85PX9Gjc/maketrallylevels1.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND!)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/C57tdKXj/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/HknGcQpj/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/FsD5HPX2/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/Nfgvt3S6/upgradesdowngrades3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Biggest Companies Reporting Earnings Next Week\n\n&gt; The earnings slate continues to ramp up next week with 712 total companies scheduled to report. In the table below, we show the largest stocks by market cap that are set to report quarterly results. On Monday, there will be no company with a market cap above $100 billion reporting with the largest companies being Alexandria Real Estate (ARE) and multiple banks. On Tuesday, payment processor Visa (V) will be out with earnings in addition to Pfizer (PFE), Amgen (AMGN), McDonald's (MCD), and Raytheon (RTX). Visa has historically averaged the strongest stock price reaction to earnings of these names but it has gapped down for six straight quarters. That will be followed by another payment processor, Paypal (PYPL) on Wednesday. In addition to Paypal, Facebook (FB) is also scheduled to report that same day. While both stocks have averaged over 2% gains on earnings days historically, ServiceNow (NOW) has seen an even stronger performance with an average gain of 3.64%. Another major earnings report that will be widely watched is Boeing (BA) to get a gauge on how demolished travel demand has affected the company. On Thursday, three of the world's largest stocks will also be out with earnings: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOG). Each one has averaged a 1%+ gain on earnings days. Apple (AAPL) has seen some of the strongest results in recent history with last quarter snapping a streak of four consecutive triple plays. On Friday, two of the largest energy stocks, Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM), will round out the week and July's earning calendar. Both stocks have historically averaged declines on earnings days.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/Earn3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Dollar Weakness May Continue\n\n&gt; The US dollar was remarkably strong during the first quarter of 2020, benefitting from the flight to safety and rallying to nearly a 10% year-to-date gain at the stock market\u2019s low point on March 23. However, as equity markets have recovered, and the US has continued to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, the dollar has given up nearly all of those gains. We think this trend may continue, and if so, it would have important implications for a range of asset classes.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, a more diversified basket than the commonly cited DXY Index, is nearing a critical uptrend line. A break of this support could mean that weakness seen over the past few months is more than just an unwinding of the flight to safety. Through Wednesday, the index was down more than 1% for the week and tracking toward its fourth straight weekly loss.\n\n&gt; This isn\u2019t just a technical story though. As we explored last month, rising twin deficits have historically been followed by a weaker dollar, meaning the fundamentals support this move as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/July-23-picture.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The commodity rally is another reason to believe the market may be looking toward a weaker dollar. Commodities are typically viewed as having an inverse relationship with the dollar since the dollar is effectively the denominator of a hard asset. Gold prices are up more than 20% year to date, copper just traded to its highest level in more than two years, and silver prices have appreciated 28% this month alone.\n\n&gt; As for the implications of a weaker dollar, according to LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick, \u201ca weaker US dollar may be a slight negative for US consumers\u2019 buying power, but for investors\u2019 portfolios the implications are overwhelmingly positive. Commodities are rallying, US multinational companies benefit from foreign buyers being able to afford more of their goods, and international stocks do well as their underlying currencies appreciate.\u201d\n\n&gt; Recent history bears this out. The last calendar year that saw a significant dollar decline was 2017 when the Bloomberg Dollar Index fell more than 8%. The S&amp;P 500 Index rallied more than 19% on a price return basis; however, international stocks fared even better. The MSCI EAFE Index and MSCI Emerging Markets Index gained 22% and 34%, respectively, and 2017 represented the only year since 2012 that either outperformed the US.\n\n*****\n\n# Silver Gets the Gold for YTD Performance\n\n&gt; In last night's Closer, we took a look at the massive rallies of late in the precious metals space. Gold (GLD) reached its highest level since 2011, but silver's (SLV) performance on the day was even more of a sight to behold with gains in the top 1% of all days since SLV began trading in 2006. Silver (SLV) rose 6.15% for its best day since March 24th when the metal rose 7.96%. Whereas the silver to gold ratio has been in a constant downtrend over the past decade (indicating underperformance of silver relative to gold), yesterday's big gains led to a breakout of this downtrend. With SLV trading higher by over 5% yet again this morning, that downtrend is being broken even more significantly, and that is even with SLV off the pre-market highs above $21.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072220-SLV-GLD.png))**\n\n&gt; As recently as the final days of June, SLV was actually sitting on a loss year to date. That was a far cry from the performance of some of the best-performing assets of the year at the time like the Tech heavy Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) which was up over 14% and the long term Treasuries ETF (TLT) which was up over 21.5%. Silver's yellow cousin, gold, was likewise sitting on a sizeable gain of 16.6%. Pivot ahead to today and the picture is very different. Around this morning's premarket highs when SLV was trading above $21, it actually topped QQQ, TLT, and GLD as the best performing asset in 2020. That is even with each of these other ETFs also trading higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072220-SLV-GLD2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Hot Julys Often Bring Late-Summer/Autumn Buys\n\n&gt; Despite persistent pandemic setbacks, bleak economic and corporate numbers, geopolitical tensions, civic unrest and a knock-down, drag-out election battle, the U.S. stock market has proven rather resilient. After suffering the shortest bear market in history that lasted only 40 days the velocity and strength of the V-shaped rally off the March 23 bear market low has been impressive.\n\n&gt; Massive fiscal stimulus, the return of ZIRP (zero interest rate policy), vaccine promise and the boon of the \u201cstay-at-home\u201d economy have sent the market higher again here in July with NASDAQ tacking on new all-time highs, though the Dow and S&amp;P 500 continue to struggle. As of yesterday\u2019s close this put DJIA up 4.6%, S&amp;P 500 up 5.7% and NASDAQ up 6.4% for the month of July at yesterday\u2019s close, qualifying this as a \u201cHot July Market\u201d.\n\n&gt; Gains of this magnitude for July, however, have frequently been followed by a late-summer or autumn selloffs and better buying opportunities than now. In the past, full-month July gains in excess of 3.5% for DJIA have been followed historically by declines of -7.2% on average (-4.7% median decline) in the Dow with a low at some point in the last 5 months of the year. The low in 2018 came a bit late, but it was just 2 days into winter. There were also prior lower prices in late October and November.\n\n&gt; Climbing COVID cases, hospitalizations and deaths have forced rollbacks and pauses of economic reopening plans and travel restrictions. Coupled with an uptick in jobless claims and other troublesome economic readings and forecasts as well as elevated valuations, exuberant sentiment, technical resistance and seasonal weakness, stocks are ripe for a pullback. Today\u2019s selloff: case in point. This will likely set up a great buy as the $13+ trillion flows through the global economy into US stocks.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/8b02cd9a08b7fedd5996d544420d9cd8/cb70e70b199ba14d-04/s500x750/c8010183a653633c81747813512c8c74ed5214a2.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending July 24th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 7.26.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **TICKERS T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND!**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND!)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND!)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR MONDAY, JULY 27TH, 2020!](https://i.postimg.cc/ZR2gdg5q/eram01.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.27.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8D2LRQ6.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/C6Upp8Y.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.28.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/O5wY9g7.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/MjSLIaQ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.28.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/EictqLG.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/XGrwuKt.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.29.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/HMjc0WJ.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/0hMH94x.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.29.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/vFJ1WH4.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/7otjSsD.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/7g6UICu.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.30.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/FKHIibS.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/l21kL5q.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/rrBxXn7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.30.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/X4senHx.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/KqxX8LC.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/3l48OVf.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.31.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0VTb4f4.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.31.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# T.B.A.\n&gt; **T.B.A.** T.B.A.\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())\nT.B.A.\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket.",

For those that don't know, AITX specializes in Artificial Intelligence. technology. Last time the CEO said he has some news to drop, I loaded up. A few days later (Jule 1 to be exact) he tweeted about AITX's new advanced mask detection feature device.

Here is the link talking about the device:  [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robotic-assistance-devices-deploys-artificial-140000052.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robotic-assistance-devices-deploys-artificial-140000052.html) \n\nHours ago an investor tweeted the CEO asking : **\"Folks can we get some news soon! Shorts are beating up this great company everyday! We need to take back our company!\"**\n\nTo which the CEO responded:   **\"Yes! Working on items now, been a busy busy busy two days.\"**\n\nYesterday the CEO also tweeted in a reply to someone else **\"Thanks! Should be a fun week with lots of info to share!\"** Here is the link:   [https://twitter.com/SteveReinharz/status/1279905917765632000](https://twitter.com/SteveReinharz/status/1279905917765632000) \n\nSo all im saying is going by my experience the last time this happened, it might be worth it to get in right now at 0.018...because what ever news he has to drop, I am ALMOST positive it will send the stock flying again.

I will likely write about some like Corteva. I have written about KSU and Cloudflare so far.\n\n# EARNINGS PLAYS \n\n\\- **AMD.** Anticipating blowout sales. Their machining is excellent and more can be read about it here.  [https://blog.cloudflare.com/an-epyc-trip-to-rome-amd-is-cloudflares-10th-generation-edge-server-cpu/](https://blog.cloudflare.com/an-epyc-trip-to-rome-amd-is-cloudflares-10th-generation-edge-server-cpu/)  TSMC earnings will be a test case for this. But TL;DR AMD is cost effective as fucking hell, data centers are building out, and they want the best shit for the best price. AMD was there when they needed to be there.\n\n\\- **Facebook.** I believe that Facebook will begin to seriously highlight their progress and plans for e-commerce trade at the global stage in places like Brazil, Canada, US, Mexico, and India while discussing various other things like investments with Walmart, Shopify, and Rio. They will have many subjects to brief on like voter drives, advertiser damage, political and security measures to reconcile with investor attitudes.\n\n**- Dropbox.** I think people are sleeping on this. They have a strong hold on academia file management, excellent storage engineers that can anticipate data center changes, and HelloSign for business legal agreements and cross border requirements.\n\n\\- **Cloudflare.** I think they'll have a massive boost in revenue and a continued and more developed focus on how to profit from video infrastructure from companies like [JD.com](https://JD.com) and [Cloudflare.tv](https://Cloudflare.tv) . Privacy in China will be a long and hard fought battle and the future is inevitably e-commerce, video commerce, and the infrastructure required to make that competitive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# USMCA MEXICAN-AMERICAN TRADE AND INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n\\- **Kansas City Southern Rail** (Rail and cross border trade provisions)\n\n\\- **Corteva** (World first agritech provisions)\n\n\\- **Nucor Steel** (Infrastructure demand boost)\n\n\\- **Sempra Energy** (Energy provisions)\n\n\\- **Ford Automotive** (Automotive provisions)\n\n\\- **EWW ETF** (Mexican economy tracker)\n\n\\- **Crown Castle** (Telecom infrastructure)\n\n\\- **Texas Instruments** (General Computer Machining parts)  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# USMCA MEXICAN-AMERICAN TECH\n\n\\- Cloudflare (Cybersecurity provision)\n\n\\- Facebook (Digital Trade &amp; Data provisions)\n\n\\- Paypal (Digital trade provisions)\n\n\\- Dropbox (Legal agreement signatures and digital trade provisions)\n\n# You can doubt me but this is my record so far\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[30c NET June-August](https://preview.redd.it/7dwe3lwwy4b51.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0111e8d2a77849d3140b08ff07d6027faed1431c)\n\n[Facebook 220c 5\\/29 on 5\\/13](https://preview.redd.it/671ft1zzy4b51.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46175a52b16414d2e5e796f5efd999d548491fce)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Predicting USMCA x Infrastructure to bolster the economy](https://preview.redd.it/5gen3gdx15b51.png?width=1463&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec7eca2de2dd0140f8ffc3409bed4a78185415cc)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ee7hsy6cz4b51.png?width=1498&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a8a60d5fbbd4590d525aef6f9207eb07275b26a",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 27th, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings and fiscal debate could be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/24/here-comes-one-of-the-newsiest-and-most-critical-weeks-of-the-summer-for-markets.html)**\n*****\n&gt; In a summer of unending news, we may be heading into what could be the newsiest week of all.\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq\u2019s sputtering rally could be put to its biggest test yet, as tech bellwether Apple and other stalwarts of the tech rally report earnings. Early in the week, Republicans will unveil their stimulus package proposal, which will then be debated as Friday\u2019s deadline nears for the expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits.\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve also meets on and is likely to discuss other steps it can take. It\u2019s not likely, however, to make any moves as it wraps up on Wednesday, other than to assure markets it will continue to use extraordinary programs to help the economy.\n*****\n&gt; Then on Thursday, the government will release a big number many investors have been dreading \u2014 the first official reading of second quarter gross domestic product, which which should show how hard the economy crashed when it was abruptly shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect a contraction of about 35% in the second quarter, followed by a bounce back in the third quarter. But the size of that comeback could be directly impacted by how much stimulus Congress gives the economy, and how much the coronavirus continues to impact businesses and economic activity.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think there\u2019s a clear understanding of how much the economy has leaned on the crutch of government stimulus, both fiscally and monetarily,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group. \u201cEveryone will be watching for what will replace the $600 a week, and that will be the most important component of whatever plan they come up with.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The $600 weekly payment to about 30 million unemployed Americans expires Friday, and it is unlikely Congress will have a plan before that date. Strategists expect the amount to be cut in half, and Boockvar said the amount of that payment will directly impact the size of the boost to the economy\n*****\n&gt; The stimulus and tech earnings could both be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat the package looks like will be a huge deal, particularly on the unemployment benefits side, and whether tech companies can exceed the bar,\u201d said Boockvar. \u201cThat\u2019s very hard for them right now. So if they miss, does that mean it\u2019s going to be a negative for tech and not the whole market? Are we going to keep rotating to value from growth because tech has been so dominant it could take everything down?\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Earnings for the S&amp;P 500 companies are expected to decline by 40.3% for the second quarter, based on the results of companies that have already reported and estimates, according to Refinifiv\u2019s I/B/E/S. Technology earnings are expected to have one of the smallest profit declines, at just 4.4% on average.\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq, which had rallied to record highs this summer, ended lower for a second week, while the Dow and S&amp;P 500 were higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe earnings numbers overall, they\u2019ve been pretty good. It\u2019s just the basic problem with the stock market right now is that valuations are still pretty high,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cOther parts of the market that maybe look cheap on a price-to-book basis, their earnings have been hit. In the case of certain retailers, airlines, you have to worry about when their business is going to come back, if ever.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; About 80% of the companies already reporting have beaten Wall Street estimates. That is well above the average beat rate of about 65%, since 1994.\n*****\n&gt; Dozens of major companies report in the coming week, including Facebook on Wednesday and Alphabet and Amazon on Thursday. Pharmaceuticals Merck, Pfizer and Eli Lilly are expected to report, and consumer products names Starbucks, McDonald\u2019s and Procter &amp; Gamble also release results. Big oil, Exxon Mobil and Chevron report Friday.\n*****\n&gt; # Stimulus from Congress and the Fed\n&gt; Strategists expect Congress to ultimately adopt a new stimulus package of between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, but after the GOP plan is introduced it will have to be squared with Democrats\u2019 proposals. The House has its own $3 trillion spending plan. It is unlikely an agreement can be approved before unemployment benefits expire Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBipartisan negotiations between the White House, House, and Senate are officially underway, but we expect brinkmanship before passage. Trump administration officials also diverge on their expectations on timing, which remains optimistically by the end of July, and possibly stretching into August under the more \u2018realistic\u2019 case,\u201d writes Ed Mills, policy strategist at Raymond James.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Mills expects the $600 weekly payment to be cut to $300 or $400, and he said it\u2019s possible there would be more funds given to a Payroll Protection Program, to help small businesses.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOverall, momentum is building for the next package and the final price tag is arguably moving up (closer to $1.5 -2 trillion),\u201d Mills noted. Congress has already allocated $2.4 trillion in prior spending.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed will be discussing its own stimulus, and some economists expect it could again be talking about new tactics to keep interest rates low. One idea is a policy of forward guidance, where the Fed would steer market expectations more explicitly. Another is the Fed would use targeted Treasury purchases to control specific interest rates.

In the table below, we show the largest stocks by market cap that are set to report quarterly results. On Monday, there will be no company with a market cap above $100 billion reporting with the largest companies being Alexandria Real Estate (ARE) and multiple banks. On Tuesday, payment processor Visa (V) will be out with earnings in addition to Pfizer (PFE), Amgen (AMGN), McDonald's (MCD), and Raytheon (RTX). Visa has historically averaged the strongest stock price reaction to earnings of these names but it has gapped down for six straight quarters. That will be followed by another payment processor, Paypal (PYPL) on Wednesday. In addition to Paypal, Facebook (FB) is also scheduled to report that same day. While both stocks have averaged over 2% gains on earnings days historically, ServiceNow (NOW) has seen an even stronger performance with an average gain of 3.64%. Another major earnings report that will be widely watched is Boeing (BA) to get a gauge on how demolished travel demand has affected the company. On Thursday, three of the world's largest stocks will also be out with earnings: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOG). Each one has averaged a 1%+ gain on earnings days. Apple (AAPL) has seen some of the strongest results in recent history with last quarter snapping a streak of four consecutive triple plays. On Friday, two of the largest energy stocks, Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM), will round out the week and July's earning calendar. Both stocks have historically averaged declines on earnings days.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/Earn3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Dollar Weakness May Continue\n\n&gt; The US dollar was remarkably strong during the first quarter of 2020, benefitting from the flight to safety and rallying to nearly a 10% year-to-date gain at the stock market\u2019s low point on March 23. However, as equity markets have recovered, and the US has continued to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, the dollar has given up nearly all of those gains. We think this trend may continue, and if so, it would have important implications for a range of asset classes.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, a more diversified basket than the commonly cited DXY Index, is nearing a critical uptrend line. A break of this support could mean that weakness seen over the past few months is more than just an unwinding of the flight to safety. Through Wednesday, the index was down more than 1% for the week and tracking toward its fourth straight weekly loss.\n\n&gt; This isn\u2019t just a technical story though. As we explored last month, rising twin deficits have historically been followed by a weaker dollar, meaning the fundamentals support this move as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/July-23-picture.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The commodity rally is another reason to believe the market may be looking toward a weaker dollar. Commodities are typically viewed as having an inverse relationship with the dollar since the dollar is effectively the denominator of a hard asset. Gold prices are up more than 20% year to date, copper just traded to its highest level in more than two years, and silver prices have appreciated 28% this month alone.\n\n&gt; As for the implications of a weaker dollar, according to LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick, \u201ca weaker US dollar may be a slight negative for US consumers\u2019 buying power, but for investors\u2019 portfolios the implications are overwhelmingly positive. Commodities are rallying, US multinational companies benefit from foreign buyers being able to afford more of their goods, and international stocks do well as their underlying currencies appreciate.\u201d\n\n&gt; Recent history bears this out. The last calendar year that saw a significant dollar decline was 2017 when the Bloomberg Dollar Index fell more than 8%. The S&amp;P 500 Index rallied more than 19% on a price return basis; however, international stocks fared even better. The MSCI EAFE Index and MSCI Emerging Markets Index gained 22% and 34%, respectively, and 2017 represented the only year since 2012 that either outperformed the US.\n\n*****\n\n# Silver Gets the Gold for YTD Performance\n\n&gt; In last night's Closer, we took a look at the massive rallies of late in the precious metals space. Gold (GLD) reached its highest level since 2011, but silver's (SLV) performance on the day was even more of a sight to behold with gains in the top 1% of all days since SLV began trading in 2006. Silver (SLV) rose 6.15% for its best day since March 24th when the metal rose 7.96%. Whereas the silver to gold ratio has been in a constant downtrend over the past decade (indicating underperformance of silver relative to gold), yesterday's big gains led to a breakout of this downtrend. With SLV trading higher by over 5% yet again this morning, that downtrend is being broken even more significantly, and that is even with SLV off the pre-market highs above $21.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072220-SLV-GLD.png))**\n\n&gt; As recently as the final days of June, SLV was actually sitting on a loss year to date. That was a far cry from the performance of some of the best-performing assets of the year at the time like the Tech heavy Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) which was up over 14% and the long term Treasuries ETF (TLT) which was up over 21.5%. Silver's yellow cousin, gold, was likewise sitting on a sizeable gain of 16.6%. Pivot ahead to today and the picture is very different. Around this morning's premarket highs when SLV was trading above $21, it actually topped QQQ, TLT, and GLD as the best performing asset in 2020. That is even with each of these other ETFs also trading higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072220-SLV-GLD2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Hot Julys Often Bring Late-Summer/Autumn Buys\n\n&gt; Despite persistent pandemic setbacks, bleak economic and corporate numbers, geopolitical tensions, civic unrest and a knock-down, drag-out election battle, the U.S. stock market has proven rather resilient. After suffering the shortest bear market in history that lasted only 40 days the velocity and strength of the V-shaped rally off the March 23 bear market low has been impressive.\n\n&gt; Massive fiscal stimulus, the return of ZIRP (zero interest rate policy), vaccine promise and the boon of the \u201cstay-at-home\u201d economy have sent the market higher again here in July with NASDAQ tacking on new all-time highs, though the Dow and S&amp;P 500 continue to struggle. As of yesterday\u2019s close this put DJIA up 4.6%, S&amp;P 500 up 5.7% and NASDAQ up 6.4% for the month of July at yesterday\u2019s close, qualifying this as a \u201cHot July Market\u201d.\n\n&gt; Gains of this magnitude for July, however, have frequently been followed by a late-summer or autumn selloffs and better buying opportunities than now. In the past, full-month July gains in excess of 3.5% for DJIA have been followed historically by declines of -7.2% on average (-4.7% median decline) in the Dow with a low at some point in the last 5 months of the year. The low in 2018 came a bit late, but it was just 2 days into winter. There were also prior lower prices in late October and November.\n\n&gt; Climbing COVID cases, hospitalizations and deaths have forced rollbacks and pauses of economic reopening plans and travel restrictions. Coupled with an uptick in jobless claims and other troublesome economic readings and forecasts as well as elevated valuations, exuberant sentiment, technical resistance and seasonal weakness, stocks are ripe for a pullback. Today\u2019s selloff: case in point. This will likely set up a great buy as the $13+ trillion flows through the global economy into US stocks.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/8b02cd9a08b7fedd5996d544420d9cd8/cb70e70b199ba14d-04/s500x750/c8010183a653633c81747813512c8c74ed5214a2.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$AMZN** \n&gt; * **$AAPL** \n&gt; * **$AMD** \n&gt; * **$FB** \n&gt; * **$SHOP** \n&gt; * **$BA** \n&gt; * **$PFE** \n&gt; * **$MCD** \n&gt; * **$UPS** \n&gt; * **$MMM** \n&gt; * **$PYPL** \n&gt; * **$HAS** \n&gt; * **$GE** \n&gt; * **$SPOT** \n&gt; * **$V** \n&gt; * **$APHA** \n&gt; * **$EBAY** \n&gt; * **$MA** \n&gt; * **$SBUX** \n&gt; * **$RTX** \n&gt; * **$AZN** \n&gt; * **$F** \n&gt; * **$SAP** \n&gt; * **$QCOM** \n&gt; * **$CNC** \n&gt; * **$MO** \n&gt; * **$XOM** \n&gt; * **$PG** \n&gt; * **$ABBV** \n&gt; * **$GOOG** \n&gt; * **$TDOC** \n&gt; * **$RPM** \n&gt; * **$GILD**\n&gt; * **$NOW** \n&gt; * **$KHC** \n&gt; * **$DXCM** \n&gt; * **$ABCB** \n&gt; * **$BUD** \n&gt; * **$JBLU** \n&gt; * **$CLF** \n&gt; * **$PINS** \n&gt; * **$ANTM** \n&gt; * **$WING** \n&gt; * **$LRCX**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/fRgk0Fb6/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/kg5BG97Q/ervol1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR MONDAY, JULY 27TH, 2020!](https://i.postimg.cc/ZR2gdg5q/eram01.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.27.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8D2LRQ6.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/C6Upp8Y.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.28.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/O5wY9g7.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/MjSLIaQ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.28.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/EictqLG.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/XGrwuKt.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.29.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/HMjc0WJ.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/0hMH94x.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.29.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/vFJ1WH4.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/7otjSsD.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/7g6UICu.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.30.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/FKHIibS.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/l21kL5q.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/rrBxXn7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.30.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/X4senHx.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/KqxX8LC.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/3l48OVf.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.31.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0VTb4f4.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.31.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Amazon.com, Inc. -\n&gt; **Amazon.com, Inc.

I'd just like a bit of feedback whether I've made some good choices or not, I know \u00a31000 isn't a lot but at the moment it's all that I'm willing to risk while I get a feel for things. That being said, I am fed up of my savings sitting in a low interest savings account when I feel like I could get so much more put of them so I feel like I'm willing to invest more once I get more knowledge.\n\nI'd also appreciate a few tips if possible on how I can achieve the best success rate in the market, should I pay very close attention to my investments at all times or should I leave them to grow long term and not sell my shares on a whim?\n\nAnyways, here are some stocks which I have invested in to start off with. I'd like to apologise if I come across as a bit dumb or naive, I'm very new to this.\n\n\n\n- Amazon - 0.04 shares (\u00a3103.67)\n- Apple - 0.35 shares (\u00a3108.88)\n- Etsy - 1.3 shares (\u00a3114.72)\n- Netflix - 0.24 shares (\u00a3107.44)\n- PayPal - 0.7 shares  (\u00a398.70)\n- Royal Dutch Shell - 9 shares (\u00a3108.93)\n- Sony - 1.8 shares (\u00a3108.63)\n- Tesla - 0.1 shares (\u00a3135.91)\n- Walt Disney - 1.1 shares (\u00a3104.13)\n\nThanks for any insight or help in advance!",

The overarching theme behind these picks is **American Innovation &amp; Mexican Development.**\n\nI'm a 26 year old fintech engineer in the US and an avocado farmer in Mexico and I hold a strong conviction that investing in Mexican development will reward me well in the decades to come.\n\n**In a nutshell, the USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring and my strategy favors the Texas-Nuevo Leon economy and overall Mexican-American trade.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is Monterrey, Nuevo Leon\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219352-ec946e00-bb36-11ea-9fc3-b17c9e5b0597.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219352-ec946e00-bb36-11ea-9fc3-b17c9e5b0597.png))\n\nI'm from a rural village south of Jalisco which produces far more agricultural goods like avocados alongside Michoacan.\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219771-7e9c7680-bb37-11ea-98b2-7e8c2833d99a.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219771-7e9c7680-bb37-11ea-98b2-7e8c2833d99a.png))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am very aware of the problems that Mexico faces but I also view Mexico as a sleeping giant that the US utilizes for capital efficiency in global trade.

The economic damage narcotrafficking has delivered has resulted in:\n\n\\- \\[An increasing black market integration into the global money supply, in the order of hundreds of billions of dollars, resulting in a growing vacuum of theft AKA the Drug War &amp; Economics of Peace\\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank\\_Secrecy\\_Act#Sanctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_Secrecy_Act#Sanctions))\n\n\\- North American suppressed wage suppression\n\n\\- refugee style illegal immigration\n\n\\- NA workforce morale decrease\n\n\\- Mexican workforce morale decrease\n\n\\- A Mexican workforce and brain drain, as skilled and motivated laborers leave for opportunity and better pay who are loyal to both nations\n\n\\- Multiple events of civil unrest or civil disasters\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- National cyncism against the current administration\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI see this as a complex problem where most people's perspective is not complete or clouded by one of the reasons above. I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy. It is certainly in a golden era of sorts, and Mexico reflects as a nation in decline.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # The Economic Framework\n\nI am selecting industries that:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Empower the US and have a rippling effect on Mexico\n\n\\- Will fundamentally continue to build and grow the future global supply\n\n\\- Are friendly to primarily German/Euro and Japanese/Asian trade.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # My Portfolio Structure \n\nThere are two systems at play at the same time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe 12 Primary Asset Collection - these are stocks I regularly invest in.\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86082755-62bca600-ba4d-11ea-8857-95e902f8d0ce.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86082755-62bca600-ba4d-11ea-8857-95e902f8d0ce.png))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe 12 Competitor Arenas (Cloud Infrastructure Group) - these are stocks that are competing for Primary Asset Allocation each quarter and receive less allocation.\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86082923-c3e47980-ba4d-11ea-9543-b31eb000962d.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86082923-c3e47980-ba4d-11ea-9543-b31eb000962d.png))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I own 12 primary companies.

I\u2019m bummed that I didn\u2019t hold any stock long term even though I was an early adopter of AMZN, NFLX etc. and being in tech I knew they were going to be big, even NVDA or SHOP couple years ago. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t want to lose the next 10-15 years. I want to invest in a disciplined way, buy around 20 stocks and then add on dips, So I\u2019ll keep around $100K cash. My big confusion is which 20 stocks to pick? I\u2019ve been reading here, checking TipRanks, have Motley fool advisor and the list I come up with is huge. I\u2019m pasting the symbols that have creeped into my planning spreadsheet below. Also I\u2019m confused whether to buy fewer stocks at higher investment or many at lower. Also whether more investment into the stable large names (MSFT, AMZN, AAPL) or more in relatively newer names (SE, DOCU, NET etc.) I\u2019ve searched many posts on the \u201c20 stock portfolio\u201d or such but my confusion will not go away. Hence I\u2019m posting here to hear from you directly. I\u2019m 42 years old, good stable job, will have $50K more to add to the portfolio every year. I\u2019m open to moderate risk. Help me with a 15-20 stock investment portfolio that I can hold long term and add on dips. Here\u2019s what\u2019s on my spreadsheet right now:\n\nNewer stars 2 yrs: SE, NET, CRWD, CHWY, FSLY, DDOG, TTD, ZS, TWLO, TEAM, SPLK, MDB, WORK, SHOP\n\nETFs: ARKK, ARKW, WCLD, QQQ\n\nPayments or Banks: SQ, PYPL, V, JPM, BAC \n\nBetting: GAN, DKNG, PENN\n\nChips: NVDA, AMD, MU\n\nEnergy: ENPH, NEE, PCG, FANG\n\nHealthcare: LVGO, TDOC, UNH, MOH, DHR, CATS, VEEV, MODN\n\nCovid: HOLX, NVAX, MRNA, INO, IBIO, AYTU, VBIV , TTOO\n\nEVs: TSLA, NIO, WKHS, FUV, GRAF, PLUG\n\nFANG stocks: MSFT, AMZN, AAPL, GOOG, FB\n\nSocial/Entertain: PINS, NFLX, ROKU\n\nCyber: PANW, ZS, CRWD, NET, PING, FNET, FEYE\n\nBeaten down (1 year recovery): WYNN, LVS, DAL, LUV, STWD, SPG, CAR, MAR, RCL\n\nMy Options are:\n1) Invest $10K into 50 stocks since I can\u2019t choose with all the confusion\n2) Choose 15 stocks and invest $30K each or so \n3) Invest more % in couple categories above like the FANG stocks, ETFs, EVs, and less in others \n4) Buy 100 shares of 15 or so from the above list and sell covered calls getting ~$4K per week (but with the limited upside of covered calls, downside will be the same as holding) \n5) Stay 50% or more cash since the market could crash given the high valuations, pandemic and election year \n6) Something else that you\u2019d do in my shoes",

The overarching theme behind these picks is **American Innovation &amp; Mexican Development.** \n\nI'm a 26 year old fintech engineer in the US and an avocado farmer in Mexico and I hold a strong conviction that investing in Mexican development will reward me well in the decades to come.  \n\n**In a nutshell, the USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring and my strategy favors the Texas-Nuevo Leon economy and overall Mexican-American trade.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is Monterrey, Nuevo Leon\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219352-ec946e00-bb36-11ea-9fc3-b17c9e5b0597.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219352-ec946e00-bb36-11ea-9fc3-b17c9e5b0597.png))\n\n \n\nI'm from a rural village south of Jalisco which produces far more agricultural goods like avocados alongside Michoacan.\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219771-7e9c7680-bb37-11ea-98b2-7e8c2833d99a.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219771-7e9c7680-bb37-11ea-98b2-7e8c2833d99a.png))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am very aware of the problems that Mexico faces but I also view Mexico as a sleeping giant that the US utilizes for capital efficiency in global trade. Mexico is part of a puzzle that fits in a large scope that involves other bulwark nations like Germany, Japan, Brazil, and India.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n!\\[Bulwark Trading Nations\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86080247-51709b00-ba47-11ea-8d38-54da06916f57.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86080247-51709b00-ba47-11ea-8d38-54da06916f57.png))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n!\\[The North American Trade Block\\]([https://preview.redd.it/c4ej9hcrki751.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0062950618749d315101fb97d09237db961e2d40](https://preview.redd.it/c4ej9hcrki751.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0062950618749d315101fb97d09237db961e2d40))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the same time, Mexico is a nation in crisis. The economic damage narcotrafficking has delivered has resulted in:\n\n\\- \\[An increasing black market integration into the global money supply, in the order of hundreds of billions of dollars, resulting in a growing vacuum of theft AKA the Drug War &amp; Economics of Peace\\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank\\_Secrecy\\_Act#Sanctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_Secrecy_Act#Sanctions))\n\n\\- North American suppressed wage suppression\n\n\\- refugee style illegal immigration\n\n\\- NA workforce morale decrease\n\n\\- Mexican workforce morale decrease\n\n\\- A Mexican workforce and brain drain, as skilled and motivated laborers leave for opportunity and better pay who are loyal to both nations\n\n\\- Multiple events of civil unrest or civil disasters\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- National cyncism against the current administration\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI see this as a complex problem where most people's perspective is not complete or clouded by one of the reasons above. I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed.

The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.
