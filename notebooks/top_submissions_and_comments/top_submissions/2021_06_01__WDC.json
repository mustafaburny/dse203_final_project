I commented on the increased demand, and the earnings expectations in my previous DD.\n\nChia uses a proof of space approach to mining that relies on using empty hard disc space.

I expect as more people become aware of this, particularly in the West - it will lead to a shortage of hard discs and SSD's much like the current GPU shortage. There is already a shortage of HDD's/SSD's due to the initial surge of Chia interest causing a buyup of these items. However, as it gains traction, and as people realise how this is much more highly profitable in comparison to GPU mining currently - the demand will be similar to that of GPU's. \n\nThis initial surge I mention, has indeed already caused a surge in the stock prices.

Its consumer products are marketed under the brands Crucial and Ballistix. Micron and Intel together created IM Flash Technologies, which produces NAND flash memory.\u00a0Their current market cap is\u00a0$88.97 billion.\n\nMicron remains firmly positioned in a memory market as more products require chips that are experiencing a shortage right now. Many see the company's situation as a big reason why you should be buying their shares.\u00a0The shortage could particularly benefit Micron in the DRAM memory market, where South Korean chipmakers Samsung and SK Hynix are its only competitors. DRAM made up about 68% of Micron's revenue in 2020. Additionally, the company claimed about 23% of the global DRAM market.\u00a0The NAND sector is a bit more diversified thanks to the presence of Western Digital and its SanDisk subsidiary. However,\u00a0Micron is one of the largest suppliers in this segment as well.\n\nMicron's earnings for the first quarter of 2021 showed little difference from what the analysts were expecting.\u00a0They reported earnings per share of $0.98, which is 3 cents more than the consensus estimate. They reported a slight beat of revenue estimates as well. Their Q1 2021 revenue came in at $6.24 billion compared to the estimated $6.23 billion.\u00a0Their next earnings report is scheduled for **Jun 30, 2021**.\n\nAnalysts from **Deutsche Bank**\u00a0estimate Micron's stock to reach\u00a0$110 in the next 12 months. The analysts at\u00a0**Wells Fargo**\u00a0also have high expectations for this stock with a price target of\u00a0$115. Out of 24\u00a0analysts, 18\u00a0have\u00a0given Micron a BUY rating and 6 a HOLD rating.",

This is considered to be the 'green' alternative to other GPU based mining.\n\nIncreased HDD demand:\n\nChiaCoin has gone up massively in recent months, driving a rush to purchase hard drives in order to mine it. As such, there have been hard drive shortages recently due to the increased demand. Much like GPU and semi-conductor stocks, we can expect good price action (and have already seen it) for hard drive manufacturer stocks.\n' \"In recent weeks the demand and pricing for high capacity [hard disk drives, or HDDs] has seen a material step higher ... and enterprise [solid state drive, or SSD] prices have also moved higher,\" analysts at Bank of America wrote in a Thursday report. The \"primary upside driver\" for that rising demand, according to BofA: chia. '\nWestern Digital is a market leader in the production of HDD's, producing some of the highest quality hard drives that have the best life expectancy, and a good warranty. As ChiaCoin mining is very taxing on HDD's, buyers will be looking for the most durable hard drives. Which is why I am focusing my attention on Western Digital versus another stock such as Seagate. Western Digital is probably the best known manufacturer of hard drives, and usually a top choice for consumers.\n\nEarnings:\n\nWestern Digital is also an attractive pick due to it's earnings outlook. Analysts are still raising their earnings estimates for the company. The growing optimism on earnings prospects are driving estimates higher, which should get reflected in its stock price.\nEarnings estimates for the next quarter and full year are increasingly being driven higher and higher. The company is likely to earn $1.46 per share for the current quarter, representing a change of +18.7%. Two estimates have moved higher in the past 30 days. For the full year, the company is expected to earn $3.83 per share, +25.99% over last year.\nThe stock has gained 12.3% over the past four weeks. As earnings growth and the ChiaCoin frenzy are both likely to drive the stock higher - in my opinion, it is a good buy, and I will be adding it to my portfolio today.\n\nFurther DD on the impact of Chia mining:\nChia, a 'green' alternative to GPU mining has caused a global shortage of hard discs. I commented on the increased demand, and the earnings expectations in my previous DD.\n\nChia uses a proof of space approach to mining that relies on using empty hard disc space. The high profitability of mining this coin caused a surge in demand for hard discs.\n\nHowever, Chia mining is largely popular in Central and SE Asia right now, with some movement in the West. I expect as more people become aware of this, particularly in the West - it will lead to a shortage of hard discs and SSD's much like the current GPU shortage. There is already a shortage of HDD's/SSD's due to the initial surge of Chia interest causing a buyup of these items. However, as it gains traction, and as people realise how this is much more highly profitable in comparison to GPU mining currently - the demand will be similar to that of GPU's.\n\nThis initial surge I mention, has indeed already caused a surge in the stock prices. With Western digital share price being $52 at the start of the year and now around $77/78. Seagate is also up from $60 to $99.\n\nHoffman, the president of Chia Network, says he 'is suprised at the speed at which the hard disc capacity devoted to Chia has grown and admits that this is likely to caused disruptions to the supply chain for some time.'.\n\nIn summary, Chia is more profitable and more energy efficient than GPU mining. Hard drive demand has already spiked leading to shortages. I expect as this grows in profitability in Asia and the west, it will lead to further shortages much like that we see of HDD's. Therefore driving up the stock price as already has been shown.",
