I should be just as heavy into MSFT but unfortunately I was forced to sell about 6 years as I had to liquidate some holdings for reasons beyond my control. Anyways, I want to rebalance a % of my portfolio across the multiple cloud providers. Should I sell part of my AMZN and rebalance equally amongst AMZN, MFST and GOOG? I have ANET listed because I know there is cloud exposure there even though they are just hardware. Additionally, does anybody know how we can find out which cloud provider most of these streaming services (Netflix, Disney+, DAZN, Hulu, etc?? ) are using?\n\nAMZN 18%\n\nGOOG 3%\n\nANET 7%",
