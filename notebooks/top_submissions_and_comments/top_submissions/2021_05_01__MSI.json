Nokia has this proprietary chip that will play a big role in how 5G will be available. It will ease the load of 5G Network rollout because it has a 50%-%60 reduction in energy use, which is an outstanding selling point to the industries looking to tap into 5G bandwidth. It is the most efficient chip of its kind, by far, with the added benefit of boosting antenna performance. This efficiency is necessary to the way different industries and companies will utilize the 5G Network. They will go through MVNO (MOBILE VIRTUAL NETWORK OPERATOR) to basically rent out their 5G bandwidth from a cloud. This is called \\*Network Slicing\\* for all u chimps out there. For example, Tesla will rent out their own slice of dedicated 5G Bandwidth. More than 1,000 companies use MVNO already and most apes have not even heard of it yet.

        "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nI invite you to look at this stock as it might be flying under the radar. A lot of this info comes from the presentation they released yesterday (link: [https://player.vimeo.com/video/554778399](https://player.vimeo.com/video/554778399) ) and  I strongly recommend to watch it to get a better picture of the company and their products. Just a heads up, I don't think you can make a quick buck here. In my opinion, this is a long-term investment akin to MVIS, if you bought it years ago.\n\nEnter Lightwave Logic Inc. (OTCQX: LWLG) -   a technology platform company, leveraging its proprietary technology  platform to develop next-generation electro-optic polymers which  increase the efficiency of internet infrastructure by converting data  into optical signals, allowing more data to be transmitted at  significantly higher speeds and with less power than existing solutions.\n\nThe Company\u2019s current focus is on the datacom and telecommunications hardware supply chain for the 100 Gbps and 400 Gbps fiber optics  communications market, seeking to integrate its proprietary materials  into the devices that comprise key components in today\u2019s internet  infrastructure. Lightwave Logic\u2019s unique value proposition, including  ease of manufacture relative to traditional solutions, has driven  **several tier-1 and tier-2** potential strategic partners in the data and  telecommunications markets to enter into non-disclosure agreements  (NDAs) with Lightwave Logic to evaluate its technology for use in their  devices, validating the demand for the Company\u2019s solution in the  marketplace. The Company expects to introduce its technology into the  commercial marketplace in the near future.\n\nIn plain English, they design hardware that allows to transmit data faster and in larger volumes, a need, that is growing by the day. Just think by how much this industry has grown in the last year since the pandemic started. A lot of companies have shifted from office to the work-from-home model. In other words, I believe this is the right time to bet on this industry.\n\nSome good moments I personally find very attractive:\n\n* One thing I read that I really liked is that they have in-house materials synthesis, device/package design, wafer fabrication and testing capabilities at its Englewood, Colorado headquarters, which basically means they don't depend as much on widely accepted supply-outsourcing standards.\n* They uplisted from OTCQB to OTCQX in Dec. 2020 and they did it without any share manipulation, which exposed the stock to a larger market audience. Next, they plan on moving up to Nasdaq and most of the requirements have been already met (see below). All they need to hit is a higher PPS, which should be achievable considering the smart leading team and recent achievements.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vjwm9u6h2v171.png?width=504&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5207c82c33801af5b8ca63accd928d4cd5e98b32\n\n* Financials: $6.5 million cash on hand. $0.9M in debt.  O/S - 103m, Float - 87m.  Fantastic structure and only $148M market cap.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kbmta45i2v171.png?width=372&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c3d532707d8dece849eb3e7c7d1b7ed6cbd06d6\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The management team seems to be very level-headed and doesn't throw out a lot of buzz word news to pump and dump. Just look at some of the people on the board: [https://www.lightwavelogic.com/about-us/leadership/](https://www.lightwavelogic.com/about-us/leadership/)\n\nThe CEO is a knowledgeable and recognized expert in the industry.  His career started with the British Government in 1977 in  telecommunications and he did research at their prestigious labs (RSRE  Malvern) in the early 1980s and worked at AT&amp;T Bell Labs (1985-1989)  in photonics. At Motorola in the 1990s he drove the development,  including co-authorship of the first patent, of the oxide VCSEL diode  laser which is now used in laser mice, 3D sensing/FaceID in mobile  phones, optical interconnects with volumes over 1B units. From 2005-2010  he led the USA trade association in optoelectronics (OIDA) and  represented the optoelectronics industry on Capitol Hill. He has run  technical start-ups and commercialized optoelectronic and photonics  technology into manufacturing. He was voted PIC (Photonic Integrated  Circuit) business leader of the year by the PIC International Conference  in 2018. He is a technical expert to the European Commission and a  Fellow of IEEE and OSA. \n\nNot so great moments:\n\n* The company is not yet generating any revenue. They have been developing their product for years and the time to commercialize it is coming soon.\n* Hard to assess their ability to market the product although they do claim to have been working with some tier 1 and tier 2 potential partners.\n\nI wish I understood more about the product itself but I don't have any technical background so I still have a lot of digging to fully understand the picture by piecing together whatever bits I find on the internet. Right now, I'm relying on feedback and opinions of the public. If any of you has any expertise in it, please chime in! here is a link to their white papers: [https://www.lightwavelogic.com/resource-center/technical-presentations-white-papers/](https://www.lightwavelogic.com/resource-center/technical-presentations-white-papers/)",
