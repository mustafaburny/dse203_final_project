        "selftext": "I know it's controversial amongst the traditionalists, the animals, and the international espionage community, however in light of recent events, it's time to start shilling about the Memes. Namely GME.\n\nSince it's January burst GME almost on schedule moons every 3 months as do a wide variety of memes with them. Laugh now but everybody remembers CLOV, CLNE, WISH, AMC, even BB bumped. TSLA speaks for itself. Unfortunately we can't talk about certain topics however money was to be made on various other trading avenues and at this point, it's time to acknowledge the lucrative business of hype based on speculation and mathematical mechanics. \n\nFirst of all, I justify this based purely on the power of volume, and I tell you now, social fads thrive on volume, just look at Pokemon cards. \n\nWith that said and hence the floor being set by God's Second Son, Lord DFV, exercising at 156$ per share, with GME reaching sub 180$ per share, I think it's highly worth considering investing back in big daddy. \n\nGME has consistently in pattern reached sup-300$ and +240$ multiple times, excuse my liquor, but approximately on more than 10 occasions has this phenomenon occurred where the stock, which we like, goes under 200$, and skyrockets for 25% or more. \n\nTimes are desperate gentlemen and everyone loves video games for Christmas. Let's go ahead, jump on the home team, devolve, and hop aboard the Polar Rocket for the win. \n\nTLDR; watching price overnight, if it dips below 175$ will buy portion of shares with a double down set aside for anything close to 155$",

        "selftext": "A New Metric to analyze and predict the future price of stocks is here, whether we like it or not. I am talking about quantified social media sentiments. The more I learn about the correlation of sentiments vs price, the more I see traditional stock signals as insufficient for determining the stock movement, and how insight into social sentiment is critical.\n\n**The core principle underlying technical analysis is that the market price reflects all available information that could impact a market**. But is this true now? I would argue that nowadays, the price of a particular stock also reflects the social media sentiments. For e.g., AMC and GME stocks broke all fundamentals and technicals that the analysts believed to be true and depicted the price what the market sentiments provided.\n\nOver the last year, we had significant growth in terms of retail investors both in stocks and crypto -- now adding up to over 30% of the investor market. Most of them, like myself, joined the market with very limited knowledge on analysis tools. Most of them look for trends on social media to make gains and cut losses. Why? Because it saves time. Following someone else\u2019s footsteps seems a comfortable signal that moves the price of the stock. So then why do the analysis tools still exclude these signals?\n\nAs a curious follower of the market trends, I would say that it is time to come up with a new playbook for stock market analysis. A playbook that breaks down the analysis into three main areas:\n\n1\\] Technical Analysis \n\n2\\] Fundamental Analysis \n\n3\\] Social Signals \n\nand then brings it together to provide insights on the stocks. \n\nCurrently, I have not seen many platforms offer all these services. But some platforms like public, daizy, swaggstocks and alphatrend have started to work around the community aspect of investing. Will the future of fintech products evolve to include social media sentiments as one of the analysis tools is something that we will have to wait and see. But for now, based on what I am reading, it sure seems like we are headed to a future where social media sentiments would be more of a need than a nice-to-know feature.",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 6th, 2021.\n\n# **More turbulence could be ahead for stocks as investors weigh omicron and the Fed\u2019s next steps - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/03/stocks-could-face-more-turbulence-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Volatility could continue to plague markets after a week of violent swings that sent many stocks plummeting.\n*****\n&gt; In the week ahead, investors await more news on the omicron Covid variant and another inflation report Friday that is expected to show consumer prices remain the hottest in three decades.\n*****\n&gt; In the past week, stocks sold off on worries about the omicron variant and concerns the Federal Reserve will move away from its easy policies and raise interest rates sooner than anticipated. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told a Congressional panel Tuesday that the central bank will consider speeding up the taper of its $120 billion monthly bond-buying program when it meets Dec. 14 and 15. The Federal Reserve put its bond-purchasing program in place in early 2020 to prop up the economy during the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a somewhat turbulent December because we probably need to wait for earnings season to get regrounded, back to fundamentals,\u201d said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset. \u201cFor as high as a lot of the ratios would suggest, price-to-sales, price-to-earnings, when you throw it into the hopper with interest rates and everything else, things aren\u2019t that bad. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re teetering on the edge of a cliff.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But Ablin did say the comments from Powell were unnerving investors, who fear the Fed will also speed up interest rate hikes. Powell acknowledged he was wrong about inflation being \u201ctransitory,\u201d or temporary, spooking investors. The bond purchases are now scheduled to end in June.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI\u2019m not sure what investors\u2019 read on inflation is. Do they think the Fed is going to raise rates, get ahead of it too early and everything is going to roll over? Ever since Powell took \u2018transitory\u2019 out of his talk, investors have been somewhat off balance,\u201d said Ablin.\n*****\n&gt; The consumer price index or CPI for November is expected Friday morning. Economists polled by Dow Jones predict it rose 0.6% on a monthly basis, or 6.7% year over year. That compares to a 0.9% gain in October, and a 6.2% jump year over year, the biggest move in three decades.\n*****\n&gt; # Risky names slammed\nHigh fliers and growth were among the hardest hit Friday, as investors bailed out of some of the riskiest stocks. As stocks plunged Friday, Treasury yields fell. Yields move opposite price, and the move was seen as a flight to safety. The 10-year note yield fell to 1.35%.\n*****\n&gt; The ARK Innovation ETF was down nearly 12.7% for the week. Most of the growth names in the fund plunged into bear market territory. \u201cI think investors have to keep in mind that\u2019s not a 15-week strategy. It\u2019s a 15-year strategy, as far as we\u2019re concerned,\u201d Ablin said.\n*****\n&gt; For the week, the small cap Russell 2000 was down nearly 4%, while the S&amp;P 500 was off just 1.2%. The worst performing major sector for the week was communications services, which includes internet companies. It was down 2.8%, followed by consumer discretionary, off 2.4%. Financials lost nearly 2%, and the S&amp;P technology sector was down 0.4% for the week. But on Friday, tech lost 1.7%.\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve should be quiet in the week ahead. Fed officials traditionally do not make major speeches in the blackout period, which is the coming week, ahead of their Dec. 14 and 15 meeting. One exception is Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari who speaks Thursday at the Center for Indian Country Development Research Summit.\n*****\n&gt; Much of the focus will be on how the market itself is performing.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cEver since the Nov. 22 outside bearish day, all strength has been sold with lots of damage underneath the hood,\u201d said Scott Redler of T3Live.com. \u201cNow finally some of the leadership names are showing faulty action.\u201d He noted that both Microsoft and Apple were weaker.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMoney is not hiding in Amazon, Google, or Facebook. They haven\u2019t been special for weeks,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P closed below its 50-day moving average Friday, after closing below it Wednesday. The 50-day is at 4,544. That\u2019s a signal to some market technicians that the index is on the verge of breaking down. The 50-day moving average is the average closing price over the past 50 days, and is viewed as a momentum indicator.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBasically, it\u2019s effectively a retest of support because we had the relief rally [Thursday],\u201d said Katie Stockton, founder of Fairlead Strategies. She said the S&amp;P 500 needs to close below the 50-day for two consecutive days before the move is considered a breakdown.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe action in the high growth, high multiple names is not a good sign,\u201d said Stockton. \u201cWe do have some signs of downside exhaustion but not as widespread as I would hope. We\u2019re seeing some of the heavyweights, like Adobe for example, taking out levels like the 50-day moving averages.\u201d She said some of those big names have now joined the selling.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re just watching how bad it gets. Monday is going to be the tell,\u201d said Stockton. \u201cThat also gives it the weekend to settle... Extremes have gotten a little bit more extreme. Sentiment is the most oversold from a contrarian perspective since the October low.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/hk2QMMD.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/w6utI7X.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/N8u66xV.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/tagANgL.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/28oKFM3.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/t8zd2PY.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fEvF2Bm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ponrnUL.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SqxThz0.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ARPnz4g.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/3QmNJUa.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/sz567v5.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/s9GIfxy.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/zBWalJo.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/Cz7EeMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small-Cap Corrections\n\n&gt; At the close on Wednesday (12/1), the small-cap Russell 2,000 had fallen 12.1% from its recent high on November 8th, leaving the index in \"correction\" territory. A market \"correction\" is a drop of 10%+ that was preceded by a rally of at least 10% on a closing basis. This correction for the Russell 2,000 is its 58th since data for the index begins in 1978. Below is a table showing prior corrections for the Russell. The average correction sees the index fall 18.35%, which is just shy of the 20% threshold for a \"bear market.\" The median correction is a little smaller at -15.4%. In terms of length, the average Russell correction has lasted 73 days, while the median is 62 days. For the current Russell 2,000 correction to reach average levels, it would need to fall another 7% from here, and it would come to an end on January 20th, 2022.\n\n&gt; In terms of extremes, the biggest correction that the Russell 2,000 has ever experienced was the 41.9% decline seen during the initial COVID Crash from 1/16/20 to 3/18/20. The longest correction lasted 397 days from 6/24/83 to 7/25/84. In terms of the shortest correction, there were two that lasted 3 days. One of those came during the Financial Crisis while the other happened last June.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/raycorrec.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # December Typically Starts Out Weak\n\n&gt; December typically starts out weak as tax-loss selling ramps up and with the big gains this year we would expect that early December weakness to materialize. Then as you can see in the typical December chart here stocks begin to takeoff around mid-month led by small caps and the Russell 2000.\n\n&gt; This is what used to be known as the \u201cJanuary Effect:\u201d small caps outperforming large caps in the month of January. Nowadays most of the so-called January Effect takes place in the last half of December (2021 Almanac pages 110 &amp; 112, 2022 pages 112 &amp; 114). The January Effect is not to be confused with the January Barometer (2021 Almanac page 16, 2022 page 18), which states as the S&amp;P 500 goes in January, so goes the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/84caf5990b652671445781962a51ee2f/b2ebb400780bd4c8-af/s500x750/1795f2bbf763fb254a002bda32bd9b217881240b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # December Almanac: Small Cap Effect &amp; Santa Claus Rally\n\n&gt; Trading in December is holiday inspired and fueled by a buying bias throughout the month. However, the first part of the month tends to be weaker as tax-loss selling and yearend portfolio restructuring begins. Regardless, December is laden with market seasonality and important events.\n\n&gt; December is the number three S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials month since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% on each index. It\u2019s the second-best Russell 2000 (1979) month and third best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000 (1979). In 2018, DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of 2018 is not all that likely. When December is down it is usually a turning point in the market\u2014near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half of the month.\n\n&gt; In the last seventeen post-election years, December\u2019s ranking slip to #7 S&amp;P 500, #7 NASDAQ and DJIA #5. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, tend to have a field day in post-election-year Decembers. Since 1981, the Russell 2000 has lost ground three time in ten post-election years in December. The average small cap gain in all ten years is a solid 2.2%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/64044be6e473181304fe66b98074cbde/5618185eea1cfe29-fe/s400x600/931f46ef694541cebb05ea5f3193a5faa1f6bc60.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Small caps tend to start to outperform larger caps near the middle of the month (early January Effect) and The \u201cSanta Claus Rally\u201d begins on the open on December 27 and lasts until the second trading day of 2022. Average S&amp;P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%.\n\n&gt; Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down. The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch\u2019s now famous line states, \u201cIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 6 Things To Know About December And Omicron\n\n&gt; Here comes December, historically a pretty solid month for stocks, but now we have the Omicron variant wreaking havoc on markets. \u201cWhat a difference a week makes. A week ago stocks were at all-time highs and the economy was strong. Now all we have are uncertainties and questions,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAs of now we\u2019re optimistic that stocks will sidestep the new variant worries, but we recommend investors buckle up their seatbelts, as the end of 2021 could be a bumpy one.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here are six things to think about as we head into the jolliest month of them all.\n\n&gt; First, historically, the S&amp;P 500 Index has gained 1.5% on average in December, which is the third best month of the year with only April and November better. But as you can see here, over the past 10 years, December has been much weaker. Of course, much of this was due to a huge 9.2% drop in 2018 (which we\u2019ll get to soon enough).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-pic-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Second, some more good news is December has been up 74.3% of the time, more than any other month of the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-2-.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; drop in 2018. Only once in history was December the worst month of the year for the S&amp;P 500 and it was indeed in 2018. Three times it was the second worst month of the year, in 1968, 1980, and 1996. The worst monthly return so far this year was a 4.8% drop in September.\n\n&gt; Fourth, stocks usually don\u2019t get moving until the second half of the month, right as the holiday good feel vibes start to come out.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-pic-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Fifth, this year is in rare air, as all 11 months have made a new all-time high so far. Should the S&amp;P 500 make new highs in December that would be a perfect 12 for 12, matching 2014 as the only years to complete this incredible feat.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-post-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Sixth, as we show in the LPL Chart of the Day, it turns out that when stocks are up more than 20% for the year heading into December (like 2021), the final month actually does better, up 1.7% versus 1.5%. Also, it has been higher eight of the past nine times the year was up more than 20% heading into the final month.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-post-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Job Growth Came Up Short in November\n\n&gt; The domestic economy added just 210,000 jobs during November, well below Bloomberg-surveyed economists\u2019 consensus forecast for a gain of 550,000 and below October\u2019s revised tally of 546,000. The net revision to prior months was positive but only by 82,000.\n\n&gt; The modest 23,000 gain in leisure and hospitality jobs, which were up 170,000 in October, and a 20,000 drop in retail jobs don\u2019t make much sense given solid retail sales data of late. That could set up a positive reversal from revisions next month, though that potential bump will play some tug-of-war with the emergence of the Omicron COVID-19 variant, which came after the November survey period ended.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, for the past four months the pace of job gains has been well below the pre-Delta variant levels of near 1 million back in June and July. However, there are a number of reasons to be optimistic that job growth picks up in early 2022, assuming the Omicron variant doesn\u2019t get in the way.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe job growth number is disappointing, no doubt, especially considering the survey period fell before we even know the name of the newest Covid-19 variant,\u201d noted LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. \u201cWhile Omicron may curb hiring a bit over the next month or two, we remain confident in our expectation for strong job gains and above-average growth in the U.S. economy in 2022.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-pic-12.3.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The story was clearly better when looking at the unemployment rate, derived from the household survey rather than from employers. The unemployment rate unexpectedly fell from 4.6% to 4.2% in November as workers\u2014in an encouraging sign\u2014came off the sidelines (1.14 million of them), lifting the participation rate by 0.2% to 61.8%, a post-recession high but still well off pre-pandemic levels.\n\n&gt; Inflation data also painted a somewhat reassuring picture. The year-over-year increase in average hourly earnings rose less than expected at 4.8% (+0.3% month over month), below consensus expectations of 5.0% and 0.4%, and not enough to keep up with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) over the same period. It\u2019s reasonable to conclude that the increase in labor participation helped limit wage increases, but we have a long way to go there still. The labor market is still 3.9 million jobs below pre-pandemic levels and the labor market remains under-supplied, as noted above. In other words, further improvement in participation will still be needed to help contain inflation pressure.\n\n&gt; Some will argue that this report will make the Federal Reserve (Fed) think twice before accelerating tapering of its bond purchases, but we\u2019re not so sure.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere were a number of positives with this jobs report,\u201d explained LPL Financial Fixed Income Strategist Lawrence Gillum. \u201cLabor force participation increased and the unemployment rate fell\u2014both of which point to a continued strong jobs market. That may give the Fed reasons to speed up its tapering plans.\u201d\n\n&gt; Overall, this report is a disappointing reminder that we\u2019re going to have to wait longer for the booming jobs numbers that we still expect to see. We continue to expect more people to get back to work in the months ahead, in an environment of strong labor demand, which can help alleviate wage pressure and firm up the economic growth outlook. Omicron is a risk but based on the information we have today, we do not expect that variant, or any others, to meaningfully slow the job market recovery in 2022.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending December 3rd, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.5.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * (**$CHPT $GME $LULU $CHWY $COST $AZO $RH $SAIC $LOVE $AVGO $DLHC $PATH $COUP $MDB $ASO $DBI $THO $ORCL $PLAY $CBP $SFIX $HRL $S $CONN $SUMO $SOL $UNFI $KFY $GTLB $CIEN $ALCO $PD $TOL $HQY $CASY $CNM $VRA $GEF $JW.A $ALOT $PLAB $AOUT**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ARPnz4g.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/V8bYDe5.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.6.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/br3K0zL.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.6.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hbGoBFe.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  12.7.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tM8wghC.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 12.7.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hhcFlGr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.8.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/lPByiPr.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.8.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FNjpxcY.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.9.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2PUPQhA.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.9.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/6kqQxly.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.10.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/OcHR8nI.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.10.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ChargePoint Holdings, Inc. $21.57\n&gt; **ChargePoint Holdings, Inc.

        "selftext": "Chinese company traded on an exchange like the Nasdaq would cease. Stock listed on established exchanges are part of a system of regulation and institutional operations that can offer certain investor protections.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. If it cease to trade in nasdaq it doesnt mean we cant trade. There are many brokers who offer OTC markets. ( over-the-counter )\n2. Well, we all know hw much regulation would actually help a retail investor. What help did they do when Robinhood ceased GME trading ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Case study :**\n\nLast summer, Chinese coffee chain operator Luckin Coffee was delisted from the Nasdaq after the company revealed the fabrication of 2.2 billion yuan ($340 million) in sales. The stock hit a 52-week low of 95 cents a share. But shares rose even after going \u201cover-the-counter\u201d and closed at $8.64 each on Monday. (0.95 to 8.64)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy did this happens ? It is due to low liquidity the stocks move violently which is great for retailers who love AMC and GME.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Case of AliBABA :**\n\nAlibaba Group (BABA) stock plummeted on news that the Chinese Communist Party (\"CCP\") intended to ban foreign VIEs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Cunt bloomberg reports suggested that Beijing was planning on banning foreign listings entirely  would result in BABA and 247 other companies worth a collective $2.1 trillion being delisted.\n2. Many fud have voiced the opinion that Alibaba is at risk of being delisted.\n\nThe claim was made in publications like Bloomberg as well as smaller outlets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Important :**\n\n**Recently, China's own securities regular chimed in on the matter, saying that a ban on foreign VIEs was not being considered.**\n\nChina's securities watchdog CSRC says reports on China's possible bans on overseas listing through VIE are NOT TRUE. &lt;&lt; official tweet&gt;&gt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://twitter.com/Sino\\_Market/status/1466004472866369539?ref\\_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1466004472866369539%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1\\_&amp;ref\\_url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fembed%2F17846](https://twitter.com/Sino_Market/status/1466004472866369539?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1466004472866369539%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fembed%2F17846)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Going by these reports, it appears that China won't be banning foreign VIEs, and that BABA won't be delisted. For the short term, at least, the stock is staying on the NYSE.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PART 2  : However, the possibility of delisting is important for knowledge gain.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat would happen when a Foreign Stock is Delisted?\n\nIf you hold a foreign stock and it gets delisted from a U.S. exchange, you still own the stock. A stock's listing status has nothing to do with ownership rights: your holdings are still valid. However, you lose the ability to trade the stock on U.S. exchanges, and its NYSE or NASDAQ ticker disappears. In this scenario, you may still be able to trade the stock OTC. Most brokerages allow OTC trading, though not all stocks are supported. As part of this article, OTC stocks inside a brokerage account:\n\n**Volkswagen (OTC: VWAGY).** \n\n**( VWAGY a full $125 billion )**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn BABA's case, the stock would likely be tradeable, since it has a large market cap and already has an OTC ticker **(OTCPK:BABAF)**.\n\nIf BABA were delisted your broker would roll you over to the OTC shares, allowing you to trade them that way. The above is pretty much what happens to investors still holding a stock when it is delisted. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOption 2 for BABA'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Converting BABA shares to 9988 shares.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n'9988' is the ticker symbol for Alibaba on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Each 9988 share is worth 1/8th of a BABA ADR. This means that you can have your broker convert each BABA share you own to eight 9988 shares. Then, you will have regular exchange-traded shares that trade during Hong Kong business hours Monday to Friday. In order to get them, you may have to call your broker.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\"DONT PANIC AND SELL in this FUD\"**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cathie Wood\u2019s money managing firm Ark Invest on Thursday for the first time bought shares in the U.S. listed Chinese electric vehicle maker Xpeng Inc on the dip . Ark Invest picked up 277,263 shares \u2014 estimated to be worth $13.39 million .**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I hope this helped in giving new perspective about Delisting Stonks and nothing there to Panic**",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 6th, 2021.\n\n# **More turbulence could be ahead for stocks as investors weigh omicron and the Fed\u2019s next steps - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/03/stocks-could-face-more-turbulence-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Volatility could continue to plague markets after a week of violent swings that sent many stocks plummeting.\n*****\n&gt; In the week ahead, investors await more news on the omicron Covid variant and another inflation report Friday that is expected to show consumer prices remain the hottest in three decades.\n*****\n&gt; In the past week, stocks sold off on worries about the omicron variant and concerns the Federal Reserve will move away from its easy policies and raise interest rates sooner than anticipated. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told a Congressional panel Tuesday that the central bank will consider speeding up the taper of its $120 billion monthly bond-buying program when it meets Dec. 14 and 15. The Federal Reserve put its bond-purchasing program in place in early 2020 to prop up the economy during the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a somewhat turbulent December because we probably need to wait for earnings season to get regrounded, back to fundamentals,\u201d said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset. \u201cFor as high as a lot of the ratios would suggest, price-to-sales, price-to-earnings, when you throw it into the hopper with interest rates and everything else, things aren\u2019t that bad. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re teetering on the edge of a cliff.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But Ablin did say the comments from Powell were unnerving investors, who fear the Fed will also speed up interest rate hikes. Powell acknowledged he was wrong about inflation being \u201ctransitory,\u201d or temporary, spooking investors. The bond purchases are now scheduled to end in June.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI\u2019m not sure what investors\u2019 read on inflation is. Do they think the Fed is going to raise rates, get ahead of it too early and everything is going to roll over? Ever since Powell took \u2018transitory\u2019 out of his talk, investors have been somewhat off balance,\u201d said Ablin.\n*****\n&gt; The consumer price index or CPI for November is expected Friday morning. Economists polled by Dow Jones predict it rose 0.6% on a monthly basis, or 6.7% year over year. That compares to a 0.9% gain in October, and a 6.2% jump year over year, the biggest move in three decades.\n*****\n&gt; # Risky names slammed\nHigh fliers and growth were among the hardest hit Friday, as investors bailed out of some of the riskiest stocks. As stocks plunged Friday, Treasury yields fell. Yields move opposite price, and the move was seen as a flight to safety. The 10-year note yield fell to 1.35%.\n*****\n&gt; The ARK Innovation ETF was down nearly 12.7% for the week. Most of the growth names in the fund plunged into bear market territory. \u201cI think investors have to keep in mind that\u2019s not a 15-week strategy. It\u2019s a 15-year strategy, as far as we\u2019re concerned,\u201d Ablin said.\n*****\n&gt; For the week, the small cap Russell 2000 was down nearly 4%, while the S&amp;P 500 was off just 1.2%. The worst performing major sector for the week was communications services, which includes internet companies. It was down 2.8%, followed by consumer discretionary, off 2.4%. Financials lost nearly 2%, and the S&amp;P technology sector was down 0.4% for the week. But on Friday, tech lost 1.7%.\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve should be quiet in the week ahead. Fed officials traditionally do not make major speeches in the blackout period, which is the coming week, ahead of their Dec. 14 and 15 meeting. One exception is Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari who speaks Thursday at the Center for Indian Country Development Research Summit.\n*****\n&gt; Much of the focus will be on how the market itself is performing.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cEver since the Nov. 22 outside bearish day, all strength has been sold with lots of damage underneath the hood,\u201d said Scott Redler of T3Live.com. \u201cNow finally some of the leadership names are showing faulty action.\u201d He noted that both Microsoft and Apple were weaker.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMoney is not hiding in Amazon, Google, or Facebook. They haven\u2019t been special for weeks,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P closed below its 50-day moving average Friday, after closing below it Wednesday. The 50-day is at 4,544. That\u2019s a signal to some market technicians that the index is on the verge of breaking down. The 50-day moving average is the average closing price over the past 50 days, and is viewed as a momentum indicator.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBasically, it\u2019s effectively a retest of support because we had the relief rally [Thursday],\u201d said Katie Stockton, founder of Fairlead Strategies. She said the S&amp;P 500 needs to close below the 50-day for two consecutive days before the move is considered a breakdown.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe action in the high growth, high multiple names is not a good sign,\u201d said Stockton. \u201cWe do have some signs of downside exhaustion but not as widespread as I would hope. We\u2019re seeing some of the heavyweights, like Adobe for example, taking out levels like the 50-day moving averages.\u201d She said some of those big names have now joined the selling.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re just watching how bad it gets. Monday is going to be the tell,\u201d said Stockton. \u201cThat also gives it the weekend to settle... Extremes have gotten a little bit more extreme. Sentiment is the most oversold from a contrarian perspective since the October low.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/hk2QMMD.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/w6utI7X.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/N8u66xV.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/tagANgL.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/28oKFM3.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/t8zd2PY.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fEvF2Bm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ponrnUL.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SqxThz0.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/r0gUrDf.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/3QmNJUa.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/sz567v5.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/s9GIfxy.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/zBWalJo.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/Cz7EeMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small-Cap Corrections\n\n&gt; At the close on Wednesday (12/1), the small-cap Russell 2,000 had fallen 12.1% from its recent high on November 8th, leaving the index in \"correction\" territory. A market \"correction\" is a drop of 10%+ that was preceded by a rally of at least 10% on a closing basis. This correction for the Russell 2,000 is its 58th since data for the index begins in 1978. Below is a table showing prior corrections for the Russell. The average correction sees the index fall 18.35%, which is just shy of the 20% threshold for a \"bear market.\" The median correction is a little smaller at -15.4%. In terms of length, the average Russell correction has lasted 73 days, while the median is 62 days. For the current Russell 2,000 correction to reach average levels, it would need to fall another 7% from here, and it would come to an end on January 20th, 2022.\n\n&gt; In terms of extremes, the biggest correction that the Russell 2,000 has ever experienced was the 41.9% decline seen during the initial COVID Crash from 1/16/20 to 3/18/20. The longest correction lasted 397 days from 6/24/83 to 7/25/84. In terms of the shortest correction, there were two that lasted 3 days. One of those came during the Financial Crisis while the other happened last June.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/raycorrec.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # December Typically Starts Out Weak\n\n&gt; December typically starts out weak as tax-loss selling ramps up and with the big gains this year we would expect that early December weakness to materialize. Then as you can see in the typical December chart here stocks begin to takeoff around mid-month led by small caps and the Russell 2000.\n\n&gt; This is what used to be known as the \u201cJanuary Effect:\u201d small caps outperforming large caps in the month of January. Nowadays most of the so-called January Effect takes place in the last half of December (2021 Almanac pages 110 &amp; 112, 2022 pages 112 &amp; 114). The January Effect is not to be confused with the January Barometer (2021 Almanac page 16, 2022 page 18), which states as the S&amp;P 500 goes in January, so goes the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/84caf5990b652671445781962a51ee2f/b2ebb400780bd4c8-af/s500x750/1795f2bbf763fb254a002bda32bd9b217881240b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # December Almanac: Small Cap Effect &amp; Santa Claus Rally\n\n&gt; Trading in December is holiday inspired and fueled by a buying bias throughout the month. However, the first part of the month tends to be weaker as tax-loss selling and yearend portfolio restructuring begins. Regardless, December is laden with market seasonality and important events.\n\n&gt; December is the number three S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials month since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% on each index. It\u2019s the second-best Russell 2000 (1979) month and third best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000 (1979). In 2018, DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of 2018 is not all that likely. When December is down it is usually a turning point in the market\u2014near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half of the month.\n\n&gt; In the last seventeen post-election years, December\u2019s ranking slip to #7 S&amp;P 500, #7 NASDAQ and DJIA #5. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, tend to have a field day in post-election-year Decembers. Since 1981, the Russell 2000 has lost ground three time in ten post-election years in December. The average small cap gain in all ten years is a solid 2.2%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/64044be6e473181304fe66b98074cbde/5618185eea1cfe29-fe/s400x600/931f46ef694541cebb05ea5f3193a5faa1f6bc60.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Small caps tend to start to outperform larger caps near the middle of the month (early January Effect) and The \u201cSanta Claus Rally\u201d begins on the open on December 27 and lasts until the second trading day of 2022. Average S&amp;P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%.\n\n&gt; Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down. The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch\u2019s now famous line states, \u201cIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 6 Things To Know About December And Omicron\n\n&gt; Here comes December, historically a pretty solid month for stocks, but now we have the Omicron variant wreaking havoc on markets. \u201cWhat a difference a week makes. A week ago stocks were at all-time highs and the economy was strong. Now all we have are uncertainties and questions,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAs of now we\u2019re optimistic that stocks will sidestep the new variant worries, but we recommend investors buckle up their seatbelts, as the end of 2021 could be a bumpy one.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here are six things to think about as we head into the jolliest month of them all.\n\n&gt; First, historically, the S&amp;P 500 Index has gained 1.5% on average in December, which is the third best month of the year with only April and November better. But as you can see here, over the past 10 years, December has been much weaker. Of course, much of this was due to a huge 9.2% drop in 2018 (which we\u2019ll get to soon enough).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-pic-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Second, some more good news is December has been up 74.3% of the time, more than any other month of the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-2-.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; drop in 2018. Only once in history was December the worst month of the year for the S&amp;P 500 and it was indeed in 2018. Three times it was the second worst month of the year, in 1968, 1980, and 1996. The worst monthly return so far this year was a 4.8% drop in September.\n\n&gt; Fourth, stocks usually don\u2019t get moving until the second half of the month, right as the holiday good feel vibes start to come out.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-pic-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Fifth, this year is in rare air, as all 11 months have made a new all-time high so far. Should the S&amp;P 500 make new highs in December that would be a perfect 12 for 12, matching 2014 as the only years to complete this incredible feat.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-post-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Sixth, as we show in the LPL Chart of the Day, it turns out that when stocks are up more than 20% for the year heading into December (like 2021), the final month actually does better, up 1.7% versus 1.5%. Also, it has been higher eight of the past nine times the year was up more than 20% heading into the final month.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-post-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Job Growth Came Up Short in November\n\n&gt; The domestic economy added just 210,000 jobs during November, well below Bloomberg-surveyed economists\u2019 consensus forecast for a gain of 550,000 and below October\u2019s revised tally of 546,000. The net revision to prior months was positive but only by 82,000.\n\n&gt; The modest 23,000 gain in leisure and hospitality jobs, which were up 170,000 in October, and a 20,000 drop in retail jobs don\u2019t make much sense given solid retail sales data of late. That could set up a positive reversal from revisions next month, though that potential bump will play some tug-of-war with the emergence of the Omicron COVID-19 variant, which came after the November survey period ended.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, for the past four months the pace of job gains has been well below the pre-Delta variant levels of near 1 million back in June and July. However, there are a number of reasons to be optimistic that job growth picks up in early 2022, assuming the Omicron variant doesn\u2019t get in the way.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe job growth number is disappointing, no doubt, especially considering the survey period fell before we even know the name of the newest Covid-19 variant,\u201d noted LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. \u201cWhile Omicron may curb hiring a bit over the next month or two, we remain confident in our expectation for strong job gains and above-average growth in the U.S. economy in 2022.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-pic-12.3.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The story was clearly better when looking at the unemployment rate, derived from the household survey rather than from employers. The unemployment rate unexpectedly fell from 4.6% to 4.2% in November as workers\u2014in an encouraging sign\u2014came off the sidelines (1.14 million of them), lifting the participation rate by 0.2% to 61.8%, a post-recession high but still well off pre-pandemic levels.\n\n&gt; Inflation data also painted a somewhat reassuring picture. The year-over-year increase in average hourly earnings rose less than expected at 4.8% (+0.3% month over month), below consensus expectations of 5.0% and 0.4%, and not enough to keep up with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) over the same period. It\u2019s reasonable to conclude that the increase in labor participation helped limit wage increases, but we have a long way to go there still. The labor market is still 3.9 million jobs below pre-pandemic levels and the labor market remains under-supplied, as noted above. In other words, further improvement in participation will still be needed to help contain inflation pressure.\n\n&gt; Some will argue that this report will make the Federal Reserve (Fed) think twice before accelerating tapering of its bond purchases, but we\u2019re not so sure.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere were a number of positives with this jobs report,\u201d explained LPL Financial Fixed Income Strategist Lawrence Gillum. \u201cLabor force participation increased and the unemployment rate fell\u2014both of which point to a continued strong jobs market. That may give the Fed reasons to speed up its tapering plans.\u201d\n\n&gt; Overall, this report is a disappointing reminder that we\u2019re going to have to wait longer for the booming jobs numbers that we still expect to see. We continue to expect more people to get back to work in the months ahead, in an environment of strong labor demand, which can help alleviate wage pressure and firm up the economic growth outlook. Omicron is a risk but based on the information we have today, we do not expect that variant, or any others, to meaningfully slow the job market recovery in 2022.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending December 3rd, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.5.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * (**$COUP $MDB $HQY $GTLB $SUMO $AZO $DBI $ALCO $CHPT $PLAY $SFIX $TOL $SOL $PD $S $CDMO $AVAV $LOVE $GME $RH $PATH $GEF $OXM $CHWY $LULU $COST $ORCL $AVGO $MTN $KLXE $KSPN $ASO**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/r0gUrDf.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/evjwA2L.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.6.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/br3K0zL.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.6.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hbGoBFe.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  12.7.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tM8wghC.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 12.7.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hhcFlGr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.8.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/lPByiPr.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.8.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FNjpxcY.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.9.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2PUPQhA.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.9.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/6kqQxly.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.10.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/OcHR8nI.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.10.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n&gt; **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.),\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/smallstreetbets. :)",

        "selftext": "# Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/smallstreetbets sub! Welcome to the new trading week and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, December 6th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Dow futures jump 200 points as investors rotate out of tech and into bets on the recovery](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/05/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n*****\n&gt; Dow Jones Industrial average futures jumped and Nasdaq-100 futures lagged as investors looked past the emerging threat from the omicron Covid-19 variant, rotating out of high-priced technology shares and into names linked to the recovering economy.\n*****\n&gt; Here\u2019s what was influencing the markets to start the week:\n&gt; * Shares linked to the economic reopening gained in Monday premarket trading like energy, industrials and airlines.\n&gt; * Investors continued to sell tech stocks with relatively high valuations. Those shares dragged the market down to a losing week on Wall Street last week.\n&gt; * The 10-year Treasury yield rebounded after falling last week amid the omicron threat.\n&gt; * There\u2019s a major shift underway at the Federal Reserve to bring about a faster end to its pandemic easing policies.\n&gt; * Bitcoin lost $10,000 since Friday, including a sudden drop overnight from Friday to Saturday. The move showed decreasing risk appetite and is hitting related tech stocks.\n&gt; * Dow futures gained 223 points, or 0.8%, while Nasdaq-100 futures shed 0.2% in early Monday trading. S&amp;P 500 futures were higher by 0.3%.\n*****\n&gt; High-priced tech shares were lower in premarket trading, continuing a de-risking theme in markets. Nvidia was off by nearly 3% in premarket trading. Tesla fell about 2%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cSuper-cap tech has been well bid on the expectation of \u2018forever\u2019 low rates and support,\u201d said Tom Essaye, author of the Sevens Report, \u201cbut with the prospect of rates rising and this new Fed paradigm, we are seeing investors rotate out of tech and into sectors with better exposure to higher growth.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He added that it was the Fed that pulled the market back late last week, and not fears about the omicron variant.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cTech pulled the entire market lower. Essentially, we are seeing a sort of Taper Tantrum 2.0 as markets react to a more hawkish Fed and rotate into sectors with more positive exposure to rising rates,\u201d Essaye said.\n*****\n&gt; On Friday, the Nasdaq Composite slid 1.92% with shares of Tesla as the biggest drag. Cathie Wood\u2019s flagship Ark Innovation Fund fell more than 5% Friday, and all of the fund\u2019s holdings are now in a bear market apart from two stocks. Teladoc Health, Zoom Video, Roku, Palantir and Twilio are some of the names that have registered steep losses.\n*****\n&gt; Ark Innovation was down another 2% in premarket trading Monday.\n*****\n&gt; Last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell unnerved markets by signaling the Fed\u2019s focus was inflation, even with the new variant emerging.\n*****\n&gt; Comments by Fed officials suggest that the Fed is likely to decide to double the pace of its taper to $30 billion a month at its meeting next week, CNBC\u2019s Steve Liesman reported on Monday. Initial discussions could also begin as soon as the December meeting about when to raise interest rates and by how much next year.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks linked to the reopening of the economy gained on Monday, boosting sentiment on Dow futures. Boeing and Chevron shares were in the green.\n*****\n&gt; Delta Airlines shares gained about 2% in premarket trading. Carnival and Wynn Resorts shares were about about 1%. Cruise lines and travel booking stocks were higher too.\n*****\n&gt; Bitcoin traded around $57,000 on Friday morning, but by Saturday had plunged to around $43,000. By Monday the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency had clawed back some of its losses, last trading at around $47,377.\n*****\n&gt; Shares of Coinbase lost more than 4% in premarket trading, while Square declined by about 2%.\n*****\n&gt; Slower-than-expected job growth also contributed to Friday\u2019s selling. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 210,000 last month, the Labor Department said Friday, which was below the 573,000 number economists surveyed by Dow Jones were expecting.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cA softer payrolls print pulled the rug beneath risk sentiment,\u201d TD Securities wrote Friday in a note to clients. As investors fled to safety the yield on the 10-year Treasury dipped to 1.335%, the lowest since Sept. 21.\n*****\n&gt; Friday\u2019s selling wrapped up a volatile week for the major averages as investors evaluated new information about the omicron variant.\n*****\n&gt; All three major averages finished the week in the red, with the Dow registering a fourth straight negative week for the first time since September 2020. The S&amp;P and Nasdaq Composite were both down for a second consecutive week.\n*****\n&gt; Small cap names were hit especially hard, with the Russell 2000 falling 3.86% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cDespite our forecast for a flat year for the S&amp;P 500...we are still bullish on pockets of the market, including small caps,\u201d Bank of America said Friday in a note to clients. \u201cSmall caps are more domestic, more exposed to the services spending recovery, bigger beneficiaries of capex/reshoring and are inexpensive vs. large caps,\u201d the firm added.\n*****\n&gt; However, Bank of America said the potential upside for small caps hinges on Covid cases staying under control.\n*****\n&gt; The omicron variant has now been discovered in at least 15 U.S. states, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told ABC News on Sunday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe know we have several dozen cases and we\u2019re following them closely. And we are every day hearing about more and more probable cases so that number is likely to rise,\u201d she said on \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](hhttps://i.imgur.com/hk2QMMD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/w6utI7X.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/UmSQYNH.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/28oKFM3.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/UbdFVET.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($CHPT $GME $LULU $CHWY $COST $AZO $RH $SAIC $LOVE $AVGO $DLHC $PATH $COUP $MDB $ASO $DBI $THO $ORCL $PLAY $CBP $SFIX $HRL $S $CONN $SUMO $SOL $UNFI $KFY $GTLB $CIEN $ALCO $PD $TOL $HQY $CASY $CNM $VRA $GEF $JW.A $ALOT $PLAB $AOUT)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/ARPnz4g.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\n(N/A.)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/v0Sno0F.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/yS9qzWO.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/sz567v5.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/s9GIfxy.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/zBWalJo.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/Cz7EeMl.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/b9WecCH.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/YNP20Vh.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/an62JBq.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* CFVI\n* AMC\n* BTT.X\n* ASTS\n* NIO\n* HITI\n* ACET\n* SRNE\n* TACO\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/06/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-kohls-factset-alibaba-and-others.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Kohl\u2019s (KSS)** \u2013 The retailer\u2019s stock rallied 2.8% in the premarket following news that activist investor Engine Capital is urging Kohl\u2019s to consider either a sale of the company or a separation of its e-commerce business.

        "selftext": "Hi apes, something fishy is going on\u2026. there is really good evidence that Citadel \u2014 who is notorious for short selling Tesla (once upon a time), recently Gamestop (before they were short squeezed to oblivion by this crowd) is now naked shorting NIO and working with major hedge funds so the can pick up the pieces dropped by the retail crowd for super cheap.\n\n**Here I offer just recent tidbits from SEC filings with Fintel:**\n\n*Citadel Advisors Llc has a history of taking positions in derivatives of the underlying security (NIO) in the form of stock options. The firm currently holds call options representing 5,654,100 of underlying shares valued at $201,456,000 USD and put options representing 23,449,600 of underlying shares valued at $835,509,000 USD*\n\n**and the subsequent buys from major hedge funds and institutions:**\n\n*Bridgewater Associates, LP reports 71.80% increase in ownership of NIO / Nio Inc*\n\n*2021-11-12 - Bridgewater Associates, LP has filed a 13F-HR form disclosing ownership of 2,839,744 shares of Nio Inc (US:NIO) with total holdings valued at $101,180,000 USD as of 2021-09-30. Bridgewater Associates, LP had filed a previous 13F-HR on 2021-08-13 disclosing 1,652,896 shares of Nio Inc at a value of $87,934,000 USD. This represents a change in shares of 71.80 percent and a change in value of 15.06 percent during the quarter.*\n\n*BlackRock Inc. reports 5.45% increase in ownership of NIO / Nio Inc*\n\n*2021-11-09 - BlackRock Inc. has filed a 13F-HR form disclosing ownership of 61,624,811 shares of Nio Inc (US:NIO) with total holdings valued at $2,195,693,000 USD as of 2021-09-30. BlackRock Inc. had filed a previous 13F-HR on 2021-08-11 disclosing 58,437,080 shares of Nio Inc at a value of $3,108,853,000 USD. This represents a change in shares of 5.45 percent and a change in value of -29.37 percent during the quarter.*  \n \n\n**This seems like BLATANT short selling manipulation to benefit institutional buyers.**  Recently as many as 40 million shares of buying on NIO couldn't even get filled due to the lack of available shares... this is essentially an ENTIRE DAY's Nio trading volume.  This level of naked shorts that Citadel has on Nio is staggering.\n\n[Share supply issue](https://preview.redd.it/fcvibvsn61481.jpg?width=3020&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f08542d7a7bbc1ca8f5ef1fb78a3c60e008eeefc)\n\nTesla has been target by the media, other industry players and shorts for years, especially Citadel.  I have the feeling that this is repeating with NIO.  People know that NIO is the real deal and a beast.  I wouldn't even rule out Bloomberg\u2019s article on the morning of NIO\u2019s deliveries last week, was placed in the morning in case NIO missed on numbers, as there has been sketchy stuff here and there.  \n\nHere's a good explanation of the share supply issues from wise-geek  \n[https://www.wise-geek.com/what-does-fail-to-deliver-mean.htm](https://www.wise-geek.com/what-does-fail-to-deliver-mean.htm)\n\n*\u2026\u201cfail to deliver\u201d transactions may be associated with margin trading and naked short selling. If of sufficient size, short sales that \u201cfail to deliver\u201d create a \u201cphantom\u201d overhang in supply of the shares of a company and can artificially depress the price of that company\u2019s stock. Hence, the U.S. Congress and the SEC have instituted procedures and penalties to be followed in the event of \u201cfail to deliver-fail to receive\u201d transactions.*\n\nAnd on a day like today where ALL Chinese and EV stocks are up after the delisting fears last week, NIO is essentially FLAT on double the normal daily trading volume! It is being bought like crazy but it seems like there is major manipulation weighing it down. How can XPEV and Li Auto both be up 7 and 8% today and Nio barely green, after the beat down of Chinese stocks this week?\n\n**TLDR:** \n\nSomething fishy is going on\u2026 Evidence suggests that Citadel (same funds that shorted TSLA (Tesla) and GME (Gamestop) is naked short selling NIO. I\u2019m curious to hear your thoughts?\n\nThis is not investment advice.  I just notice something weird happening and I'm wondering if anyone else sees this too?",

        "selftext": " \n\n## What Are Long-Term Equity Anticipation Securities (LEAPS)?\n\nThe term long-term equity anticipation securities (LEAPS) refers to publicly traded [options contracts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/optionscontract.asp) with [expiration dates](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expiration-date.asp) that are longer than one year, and typically up to three years from issue. They are functionally identical to most other listed options, except with longer times until expiration. A LEAPS contract grants a buyer the right, but not the obligation, to purchase or sell (depending on if the option is a call or a put, respectively) the [underlying asset](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underlying-asset.asp) at the predetermined price on or before its expiration date.  \n\n\n*Taken from the tutorial section in the Discord I run.*\n\n**Generally, a LEAP is considered a very long option.** An 9 month call/put is still considered a LEAP, even though it's not over a year.\n\nI know that I've touched on LEAPS before but this explanation might offer more **help to people who cannot watch the stock or day trade.** So if you want that gambling feeling without worrying about what the stock does every day, I suggest you get a LEAP option.  \n\n\nWhen you are looking for a good LEAP to get, I would recommend intrinsically valuable stocks or ETF's that are considered 'low risk' like the SPY and waiting for big dips. I know I mention this a lot, but what does this mean?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Intrinsically valuable companies, are companies that will, generally, ALWAYS go up. Ask yourself, what are people, humans, ALWAYS going to need?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHomes\n\nClothes\n\nGroceries\n\nCars\n\nFinancial Systems\n\nMedicine\n\netc etc.\n\nThe list goes on, but you get the idea. Homes is at the top of my list for one reason, take a look at HD and you'll see what I mean.\n\nCOST is another example. There are many. \n\nGenerally the stock always goes up, but what if it was going down and taking a 'dip'?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExample: Stock is 200 bucks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\"Why should I get a 205 strike for next year, instead of next month?\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**You're buying time. AKA Extrinsic value**  \n[https://www.theoptionsguide.com/options-premium.aspx#intrinsic-value](https://www.theoptionsguide.com/options-premium.aspx#intrinsic-value)  \n\n\nThe 205 leaps for next week and the 205 leaps for next year, **are probably both intrinsically worth the same, but the LEAP has way more time (or extrinsic) value left to burn through**, where as the one for next week, does not. **It has dripped out.** It is now burning Intrinsic value because there is only 1 week left. So don't hold the LEAP till the last week or even month IMO. Remember, LEAPS will make your account print hard, you just HAVE to be patient and know when to sell them. Think about it. Sure, that 205 that's cheap could run to 210, but what if you had a whole year? What if you had a call of 205 strike, held it, and then 6 months go by and now the stock is at 250? That call would be worth **THOUSANDS.**\n\nExample 2: I bought an MU LEAP 3 weeks ago when the stock was at $75. The leap was 400+ days out. the 100c was the strike. I bought it for $500. If you now look at the same LEAP it is around 1k.  \n\n\n100% Gain in 3 weeks. Let's say I hold that for another 6 months instead of cashing it out. Let's then say that MU rips to 150 next year. That single LEAP is going to be worth thousands alone. \n\nThat said, \n\nI refer you to my friend Warren. Let's take his advice when others are fearful, and let us be greedy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/ja9eQNn.png](https://i.imgur.com/ja9eQNn.png)  \n\n\nYou can't time the dip right, but if you did get in on the next BIG run up, **and get an at the money(ATM) call for at least 1 or 2 years out** you would probably see a profit anytime between then unless the entire financial system crashes. And I mean big profit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next thing you want to look at is **How much debt do they owe? How much 'Free Flow Cash' does this company have and make every quarter or annually?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can look at these yourself by typing into google : **\"XYZ free flow cash\"** or **\"XYZ long term debt\"**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt will show you. Generally if a company has at least half of it's free flow cash (FFC) to it's long term debt (LTD) Then that means it has a lot of cash to pay those interest payments and bills with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**You want to look for companies that have low debt-to-equity ratios.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis will help you find out how much that company is really worth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is exactly why GME blew up the way it did besides all the retards buying and holding it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGME cleared a lot of its LTD and acquired a bunch of FFC thanks to that Cohen guy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs the company worth 250 or whatever? Hell no, but that's a story for another time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter you find a good company you need pull up the **BIGGER CHART** and look, where was the last consolidation? aka support? **Should I wait a month or two before jumping in? Maybe more?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\"Past performance is always indicative of future results\"* or whatever that Benjamin Graham guy said. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn conclusion, please be careful and remember LEAPS are expensive for a reason, you're buying time.  \n\n\nAny questions or comments, please feel free to leave below or contact me directly. Thank you.",

        "selftext": " A New Metric to analyze and predict the future price of stocks is here, whether we like it or not. I am talking about quantified social media sentiments. The more I learn about the correlation of sentiments vs price, the more I see traditional stock signals as insufficient for determining the stock movement, and how insight into social sentiment is critical.\n\n**The core principle underlying technical analysis is that the market price reflects all available information that could impact a market**. But is this true now? I would argue that nowadays, the price of a particular stock also reflects the social media sentiments. For e.g., AMC and GME stocks broke all fundamentals and technicals that the analysts believed to be true and depicted the price what the market sentiments provided.\n\nOver the last year, we had significant growth in terms of retail investors both in stocks and crypto -- now adding up to over 30% of the investor market. Most of them, like myself, joined the market with very limited knowledge on analysis tools. Most of them look for trends on social media to make gains and cut losses. Why? Because it saves time. Following someone else\u2019s footsteps seems a comfortable signal that moves the price of the stock. So then why do the analysis tools still exclude these signals?\n\nAs a curious follower of the market trends, I would say that it is time to come up with a new playbook for stock market analysis. A playbook that breaks down the analysis into three main areas:\n\n1\\] Technical Analysis \n\n2\\] Fundamental Analysis \n\n3\\] Social Signals \n\nand then brings it together to provide insights on the stocks. \n\nCurrently, I have not seen many platforms offer all these services. But some platforms like public, daizy, swaggstocks and alphatrend have started to work around the community aspect of investing. Will the future of fintech products evolve to include social media sentiments as one of the analysis tools is something that we will have to wait and see. But for now, based on what I am reading, it sure seems like we are headed to a future where social media sentiments would be more of a need than a nice-to-know feature.",

So who is interested in creating such report? Funny enough the anonymos was a competitor handed it in. But have they also manufactured the evidence? Well the criminal underground who is known to own of AFK casinos are probably happy that EVO is down. Now hedgefunds have taken advantage of the situation and EVO is heavily shorted.

        "selftext": "I know it's controversial amongst the traditionalists, the animals, and the international espionage community, however in light of recent events, it's time to start shilling about the Memes. Namely GME.\n\nSince it's January burst GME almost on schedule moons every 3 months as do a wide variety of memes with them. Laugh now but everybody remembers CLOV, CLNE, WISH, AMC, even BB bumped. TSLA speaks for itself. Unfortunately we can't talk about certain topics however money was to be made on various other trading avenues and at this point, it's time to acknowledge the lucrative business of hype based on speculation and mathematical mechanics. \n\nFirst of all, I justify this based purely on the power of volume, and I tell you now, social fads thrive on volume, just look at Pokemon cards. \n\nWith that said and hence the floor being set by God's Second Son, Lord DFV, exercising at 156$ per share, with GME reaching sub 180$ per share, I think it's highly worth considering investing back in big daddy. \n\nGME has consistently in pattern reached sup-300$ and +240$ multiple times, excuse my liquor, but approximately on more than 10 occasions has this phenomenon occurred where the stock, which we like, goes under 200$, and skyrockets for 25% or more. \n\nTimes are desperate gentlemen and everyone loves video games for Christmas. Let's go ahead, jump on the home team, devolve, and hop aboard the Polar Rocket for the win. \n\nTLDR; watching price overnight, if it dips below 175$ will buy portion of shares with a double down set aside for anything close to 155$",

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/smallstreetbets sub! Welcome to a new day, frrrrrrrresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, December 2nd, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Dow futures rise 100 points as travel stocks get boost following omicron sell-off](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/01/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n&gt; Dow futures rose in early trading Thursday despite the arrival of the latest Covid variant on U.S. shores and as the White House tightened travel restrictions.\n*****\n&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 120 points. S&amp;P 500 futures were flat and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.4%.\n*****\n&gt; The Biden administration reacted to the news that an omicron case had been reported in California by asking businesses to proceed with vaccination requirements, even though the administration\u2019s mandate was halted in courts pending review. The White House also tightened travel rules, requiring inbound passengers to be tested within 24 hours prior to departure.\n*****\n&gt; Airline, casino and energy stocks led the gainers in premarket trading.\n*****\n&gt; Dow component Boeing\u2019s shares jumped 3.6%, cruise line Royal Caribbean was up 3.6% while MGM Resorts International moved 2.7% higher, with Covid-sensitive companies benefitting amid early evidence showing the new strain may be less severe than earlier versions.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe remain cautious on S&amp;P 500 amid a hawkish Fed tightening into an overvalued market,\u201d said Savita Subramanian, Bank of America Securities head of U.S. equity &amp; quantitative strategy.\n*****\n&gt; Still, Bank of America noted that December has historically been the strongest month for the S&amp;P 500, with the average gaining 2.3% on average since 1936 and positive 79% of the time. However, December has not always been immune to sell-offs, Subramanian added.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAnother risk is an inflation-led consumption hit, especially as fiscal/monetary stimulus run out. Fed Chair Powell\u2019s comments on accelerated tapering and retiring the word \u2018transitory\u2019 indicate that the Fed\u2019s focus is now inflation rather than employment.\n*****\n&gt; During regular trading on Wednesday, stocks posted strong gains earlier in the session, but fell on news that the first omicron case had been reported in California. The Dow fell about 460 points, after the 30-stock benchmark had advanced 521 points. The S&amp;P dipped 1.18%, giving back an earlier gain of about 1.9%. The Nasdaq Composite slid 1.83%, after earlier trading 1.8% higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cInvestors are increasingly cautious about the Omicron variant as well as the likelihood of faster tapering,\u201d TD Securities said in a note to clients.\n*****\n&gt; Wednesday\u2019s whipsaw continues a highly volatile streak for stocks as the market digests what the new variant means.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this movie before and Wall Street will likely remain COVID-variant headline driven until a clear assessment over this wave can be made,\u201d said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. \u201cThe next couple of weeks will likely see risk appetite take a cue from incremental Omicron updates, supply chain issues, and every inflation reading,\u201d he added.\n*****\n&gt; On the data front, weekly initial jobless claims numbers will be released Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET.

        "selftext": "A New Metric to analyze and predict the future price of stocks is here, whether we like it or not. I am talking about quantified social media sentiments. The more I learn about the correlation of sentiments vs price, the more I see traditional stock signals as insufficient for determining the stock movement, and how insight into social sentiment is critical.\n\n**The core principle underlying technical analysis is that the market price reflects all available information that could impact a market**. But is this true now? I would argue that nowadays, the price of a particular stock also reflects the social media sentiments. For e.g., AMC and GME stocks broke all fundamentals and technicals that the analysts believed to be true and depicted the price what the market sentiments provided.\n\nOver the last year, we had significant growth in terms of retail investors both in stocks and crypto -- now adding up to over 30% of the investor market. Most of them, like myself, joined the market with very limited knowledge on analysis tools. Most of them look for trends on social media to make gains and cut losses. Why? Because it saves time. Following someone else\u2019s footsteps seems a comfortable signal that moves the price of the stock. So then why do the analysis tools still exclude these signals?\n\nAs a curious follower of the market trends, I would say that it is time to come up with a new playbook for stock market analysis. A playbook that breaks down the analysis into three main areas:\n\n1\\] Technical Analysis \n\n2\\] Fundamental Analysis \n\n3\\] Social Signals \n\nand then brings it together to provide insights on the stocks. \n\nCurrently, I have not seen many platforms offer all these services. But some platforms like public, daizy, swaggstocks and alphatrend have started to work around the community aspect of investing. Will the future of fintech products evolve to include social media sentiments as one of the analysis tools is something that we will have to wait and see. But for now, based on what I am reading, it sure seems like we are headed to a future where social media sentiments would be more of a need than a nice-to-know feature.",

        "selftext": "Chinese company traded on an exchange like the Nasdaq would cease. Stock listed on established exchanges are part of a system of regulation and institutional operations that can offer certain investor protections.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. If it cease to trade in nasdaq it doesnt mean we cant trade. There are many brokers who offer OTC markets. ( over-the-counter )\n2. Well, we all know hw much regulation would actually help a retail investor. What help did they do when Robinhood ceased GME trading ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Case study :**\n\nLast summer, Chinese coffee chain operator Luckin Coffee was delisted from the Nasdaq after the company revealed the fabrication of 2.2 billion yuan ($340 million) in sales. The stock hit a 52-week low of 95 cents a share. But shares rose even after going \u201cover-the-counter\u201d and closed at $8.64 each on Monday. (0.95 to 8.64)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy did this happens ? It is due to low liquidity the stocks move violently which is great for retailers who love AMC and GME.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Case of AliBABA :**\n\nAlibaba Group (BABA) stock plummeted on news that the Chinese Communist Party (\"CCP\") intended to ban foreign VIEs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Cunt bloomberg reports suggested that Beijing was planning on banning foreign listings entirely  would result in BABA and 247 other companies worth a collective $2.1 trillion being delisted.\n2. Many fud have voiced the opinion that Alibaba is at risk of being delisted.\n\nThe claim was made in publications like Bloomberg as well as smaller outlets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Important :**\n\n**Recently, China's own securities regular chimed in on the matter, saying that a ban on foreign VIEs was not being considered.**\n\nChina's securities watchdog CSRC says reports on China's possible bans on overseas listing through VIE are NOT TRUE. &lt;&lt; official tweet&gt;&gt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://twitter.com/Sino\\_Market/status/1466004472866369539?ref\\_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1466004472866369539%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1\\_&amp;ref\\_url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fembed%2F17846](https://twitter.com/Sino_Market/status/1466004472866369539?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1466004472866369539%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fembed%2F17846)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Going by these reports, it appears that China won't be banning foreign VIEs, and that BABA won't be delisted. For the short term, at least, the stock is staying on the NYSE.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PART 2  : However, the possibility of delisting is important for knowledge gain.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat would happen when a Foreign Stock is Delisted?\n\nIf you hold a foreign stock and it gets delisted from a U.S. exchange, you still own the stock. A stock's listing status has nothing to do with ownership rights: your holdings are still valid. However, you lose the ability to trade the stock on U.S. exchanges, and its NYSE or NASDAQ ticker disappears. In this scenario, you may still be able to trade the stock OTC. Most brokerages allow OTC trading, though not all stocks are supported. As part of this article, OTC stocks inside a brokerage account:\n\n**Volkswagen (OTC: VWAGY).** \n\n**( VWAGY a full $125 billion )**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn BABA's case, the stock would likely be tradeable, since it has a large market cap and already has an OTC ticker **(OTCPK:BABAF)**.\n\nIf BABA were delisted your broker would roll you over to the OTC shares, allowing you to trade them that way. The above is pretty much what happens to investors still holding a stock when it is delisted. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOption 2 for BABA'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Converting BABA shares to 9988 shares.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n'9988' is the ticker symbol for Alibaba on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Each 9988 share is worth 1/8th of a BABA ADR. This means that you can have your broker convert each BABA share you own to eight 9988 shares. Then, you will have regular exchange-traded shares that trade during Hong Kong business hours Monday to Friday.

Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, December 6th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Dow futures jump 200 points as investors rotate out of tech and into bets on the recovery](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/05/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n*****\n&gt; Dow Jones Industrial average futures jumped and Nasdaq-100 futures lagged as investors looked past the emerging threat from the omicron Covid-19 variant, rotating out of high-priced technology shares and into names linked to the recovering economy.\n*****\n&gt; Here\u2019s what was influencing the markets to start the week:\n&gt; * Shares linked to the economic reopening gained in Monday premarket trading like energy, industrials and airlines.\n&gt; * Investors continued to sell tech stocks with relatively high valuations. Those shares dragged the market down to a losing week on Wall Street last week.\n&gt; * The 10-year Treasury yield rebounded after falling last week amid the omicron threat.\n&gt; * There\u2019s a major shift underway at the Federal Reserve to bring about a faster end to its pandemic easing policies.\n&gt; * Bitcoin lost $10,000 since Friday, including a sudden drop overnight from Friday to Saturday. The move showed decreasing risk appetite and is hitting related tech stocks.\n&gt; * Dow futures gained 223 points, or 0.8%, while Nasdaq-100 futures shed 0.2% in early Monday trading. S&amp;P 500 futures were higher by 0.3%.\n*****\n&gt; High-priced tech shares were lower in premarket trading, continuing a de-risking theme in markets. Nvidia was off by nearly 3% in premarket trading. Tesla fell about 2%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cSuper-cap tech has been well bid on the expectation of \u2018forever\u2019 low rates and support,\u201d said Tom Essaye, author of the Sevens Report, \u201cbut with the prospect of rates rising and this new Fed paradigm, we are seeing investors rotate out of tech and into sectors with better exposure to higher growth.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He added that it was the Fed that pulled the market back late last week, and not fears about the omicron variant.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cTech pulled the entire market lower. Essentially, we are seeing a sort of Taper Tantrum 2.0 as markets react to a more hawkish Fed and rotate into sectors with more positive exposure to rising rates,\u201d Essaye said.\n*****\n&gt; On Friday, the Nasdaq Composite slid 1.92% with shares of Tesla as the biggest drag. Cathie Wood\u2019s flagship Ark Innovation Fund fell more than 5% Friday, and all of the fund\u2019s holdings are now in a bear market apart from two stocks. Teladoc Health, Zoom Video, Roku, Palantir and Twilio are some of the names that have registered steep losses.\n*****\n&gt; Ark Innovation was down another 2% in premarket trading Monday.\n*****\n&gt; Last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell unnerved markets by signaling the Fed\u2019s focus was inflation, even with the new variant emerging.\n*****\n&gt; Comments by Fed officials suggest that the Fed is likely to decide to double the pace of its taper to $30 billion a month at its meeting next week, CNBC\u2019s Steve Liesman reported on Monday. Initial discussions could also begin as soon as the December meeting about when to raise interest rates and by how much next year.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks linked to the reopening of the economy gained on Monday, boosting sentiment on Dow futures. Boeing and Chevron shares were in the green.\n*****\n&gt; Delta Airlines shares gained about 2% in premarket trading. Carnival and Wynn Resorts shares were about about 1%. Cruise lines and travel booking stocks were higher too.\n*****\n&gt; Bitcoin traded around $57,000 on Friday morning, but by Saturday had plunged to around $43,000. By Monday the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency had clawed back some of its losses, last trading at around $47,377.\n*****\n&gt; Shares of Coinbase lost more than 4% in premarket trading, while Square declined by about 2%.\n*****\n&gt; Slower-than-expected job growth also contributed to Friday\u2019s selling. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 210,000 last month, the Labor Department said Friday, which was below the 573,000 number economists surveyed by Dow Jones were expecting.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cA softer payrolls print pulled the rug beneath risk sentiment,\u201d TD Securities wrote Friday in a note to clients. As investors fled to safety the yield on the 10-year Treasury dipped to 1.335%, the lowest since Sept. 21.\n*****\n&gt; Friday\u2019s selling wrapped up a volatile week for the major averages as investors evaluated new information about the omicron variant.\n*****\n&gt; All three major averages finished the week in the red, with the Dow registering a fourth straight negative week for the first time since September 2020. The S&amp;P and Nasdaq Composite were both down for a second consecutive week.\n*****\n&gt; Small cap names were hit especially hard, with the Russell 2000 falling 3.86% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cDespite our forecast for a flat year for the S&amp;P 500...we are still bullish on pockets of the market, including small caps,\u201d Bank of America said Friday in a note to clients. \u201cSmall caps are more domestic, more exposed to the services spending recovery, bigger beneficiaries of capex/reshoring and are inexpensive vs. large caps,\u201d the firm added.\n*****\n&gt; However, Bank of America said the potential upside for small caps hinges on Covid cases staying under control.\n*****\n&gt; The omicron variant has now been discovered in at least 15 U.S. states, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told ABC News on Sunday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe know we have several dozen cases and we\u2019re following them closely. And we are every day hearing about more and more probable cases so that number is likely to rise,\u201d she said on \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](hhttps://i.imgur.com/hk2QMMD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/w6utI7X.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/UmSQYNH.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/28oKFM3.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/UbdFVET.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($CHPT $GME $LULU $CHWY $COST $AZO $RH $SAIC $LOVE $AVGO $DLHC $PATH $COUP $MDB $ASO $DBI $THO $ORCL $PLAY $CBP $SFIX $HRL $S $CONN $SUMO $SOL $UNFI $KFY $GTLB $CIEN $ALCO $PD $TOL $HQY $CASY $CNM $VRA $GEF $JW.A $ALOT $PLAB $AOUT)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/ARPnz4g.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\n(N/A.)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/v0Sno0F.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/yS9qzWO.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/sz567v5.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/s9GIfxy.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/zBWalJo.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/Cz7EeMl.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/b9WecCH.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/YNP20Vh.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/an62JBq.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* CFVI\n* AMC\n* BTT.X\n* ASTS\n* NIO\n* HITI\n* ACET\n* SRNE\n* TACO\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/06/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-kohls-factset-alibaba-and-others.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Kohl\u2019s (KSS)** \u2013 The retailer\u2019s stock rallied 2.8% in the premarket following news that activist investor Engine Capital is urging Kohl\u2019s to consider either a sale of the company or a separation of its e-commerce business.

Then we need us apes to come to the most corrupt stock on the exchange !Globus Maritime or (glbs)just blew earnings away yesterday and went over 3x estimates yet they are still setting an all time low today ??  Talk about shorts/hedgies owning a stock ! With this having such a small float of only 20mil , it would so easy for the AMC and GME guys to absolutely destroy them ! It was done in CTRM which is in the same sector just much much much larger float and when eyes were set on them they had a similarly sized fleet asGLBS . Especially because it is only trading at 25% of its Net Asset Value alone yet the company is now super profitable !! Just absolutely wild ! Anyway need this to go viral so we can set up an attack and make us all rich off these criminal hedges and shorts ! And I don't understand why when I bring this ticker up I get a 15 day ban .... this is a HUGE scam on the exchange and us apes should rip them a new a-hole ! Millions and millions flushed into shorts hands from retail . \n\nHere is a link for the Q3 results and Q4 is going to be better : [Q3 Results as of yesterday ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/globus-maritime-limited-reports-financial-210500259.html)\n\n\nADMIN :\nAs per the rules it said no company that doesn't report thats under the specific market cap and they do report .",

        "selftext": " A New Metric to analyze and predict the future price of stocks is here, whether we like it or not. I am talking about quantified social media sentiments. The more I learn about the correlation of sentiments vs price, the more I see traditional stock signals as insufficient for determining the stock movement, and how insight into social sentiment is critical.\n\n**The core principle underlying technical analysis is that the market price reflects all available information that could impact a market**. But is this true now? I would argue that nowadays, the price of a particular stock also reflects the social media sentiments. For e.g., AMC and GME stocks broke all fundamentals and technicals that the analysts believed to be true and depicted the price what the market sentiments provided.\n\nOver the last year, we had significant growth in terms of retail investors both in stocks and crypto -- now adding up to over 30% of the investor market. Most of them, like myself, joined the market with very limited knowledge on analysis tools. Most of them look for trends on social media to make gains and cut losses. Why? Because it saves time. Following someone else\u2019s footsteps seems a comfortable signal that moves the price of the stock. So then why do the analysis tools still exclude these signals?\n\nAs a curious follower of the market trends, I would say that it is time to come up with a new playbook for stock market analysis. A playbook that breaks down the analysis into three main areas:\n\n1\\] Technical Analysis \n\n2\\] Fundamental Analysis \n\n3\\] Social Signals \n\nand then brings it together to provide insights on the stocks. \n\nCurrently, I have not seen many platforms offer all these services. But some platforms like public, daizy, swaggstocks and alphatrend have started to work around the community aspect of investing. Will the future of fintech products evolve to include social media sentiments as one of the analysis tools is something that we will have to wait and see. But for now, based on what I am reading, it sure seems like we are headed to a future where social media sentiments would be more of a need than a nice-to-know feature.",

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to a new day, frrrrrrrresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, December 2nd, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Dow futures rise 100 points as travel stocks get boost following omicron sell-off](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/01/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n&gt; Dow futures rose in early trading Thursday despite the arrival of the latest Covid variant on U.S. shores and as the White House tightened travel restrictions.\n*****\n&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 120 points. S&amp;P 500 futures were flat and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.4%.\n*****\n&gt; The Biden administration reacted to the news that an omicron case had been reported in California by asking businesses to proceed with vaccination requirements, even though the administration\u2019s mandate was halted in courts pending review. The White House also tightened travel rules, requiring inbound passengers to be tested within 24 hours prior to departure.\n*****\n&gt; Airline, casino and energy stocks led the gainers in premarket trading.\n*****\n&gt; Dow component Boeing\u2019s shares jumped 3.6%, cruise line Royal Caribbean was up 3.6% while MGM Resorts International moved 2.7% higher, with Covid-sensitive companies benefitting amid early evidence showing the new strain may be less severe than earlier versions.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe remain cautious on S&amp;P 500 amid a hawkish Fed tightening into an overvalued market,\u201d said Savita Subramanian, Bank of America Securities head of U.S. equity &amp; quantitative strategy.\n*****\n&gt; Still, Bank of America noted that December has historically been the strongest month for the S&amp;P 500, with the average gaining 2.3% on average since 1936 and positive 79% of the time. However, December has not always been immune to sell-offs, Subramanian added.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAnother risk is an inflation-led consumption hit, especially as fiscal/monetary stimulus run out. Fed Chair Powell\u2019s comments on accelerated tapering and retiring the word \u2018transitory\u2019 indicate that the Fed\u2019s focus is now inflation rather than employment.\n*****\n&gt; During regular trading on Wednesday, stocks posted strong gains earlier in the session, but fell on news that the first omicron case had been reported in California. The Dow fell about 460 points, after the 30-stock benchmark had advanced 521 points. The S&amp;P dipped 1.18%, giving back an earlier gain of about 1.9%. The Nasdaq Composite slid 1.83%, after earlier trading 1.8% higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cInvestors are increasingly cautious about the Omicron variant as well as the likelihood of faster tapering,\u201d TD Securities said in a note to clients.\n*****\n&gt; Wednesday\u2019s whipsaw continues a highly volatile streak for stocks as the market digests what the new variant means.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this movie before and Wall Street will likely remain COVID-variant headline driven until a clear assessment over this wave can be made,\u201d said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. \u201cThe next couple of weeks will likely see risk appetite take a cue from incremental Omicron updates, supply chain issues, and every inflation reading,\u201d he added.\n*****\n&gt; On the data front, weekly initial jobless claims numbers will be released Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists are expecting a print of 240,000, according to estimates from Dow Jones. The prior reading showed 199,000 first-time filers, which was the lowest since November 1969. The November jobs report will be released on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Thursday\u2019s reading follows a better-than-expected ADP report on Wednesday. Private payrolls increased by 534,000 in November, ahead of the expected 506,000.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/lcmXJqv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/s3ioTNr.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/p6nFjhw.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Jml9Z5I.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/5KwRD2M.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($LI $CRM $CRWD $DOCU $SNOW $AI $DG $MRVL $ZS $ASAN $OKTA $ULTA $AMBA $NTAP $SIG $EXPR $HPE $BBW $BQ $BNS $JKS $FRO $MOMO $HIBB $SPLK $SWBI $QH $RY $CHS $BZUN $FIVE $BOX $VERU $YJ $KR $CTRN $TD $VEEV $BIG $GMS $DOOO $CM $EMKR $PVH)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/5ocvp67.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($DG $KR $EXPR $SIG $TD $VERU $GMS $DLTH $CM $LE $SCWX $EH $MEI)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/C4kn8oK.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XAPdoyp.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/P3xLOTx.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/G1tGjkp.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/8154yxP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/830rtCF.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5SsP6hb.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Vwv5b34.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/21JATCM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* AAPL\n* DWAC\n* BA\n* ABUS\n* AMC\n* ADA.X\n* CFVI\n* CMMB\n* AGC\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/02/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-snowflake-boeing-apple-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Snowflake** \u2014 The cloud data company\u2019s shares jumped more than 13% after the company reported quarterly results that beat revenue estimates.

        "selftext": "# Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to the new trading week and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, December 6th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# Dow futures jump 200 points as investors rotate out of tech and into bets on the recovery](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/05/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n*****\n&gt; Dow Jones Industrial average futures jumped and Nasdaq-100 futures lagged as investors looked past the emerging threat from the omicron Covid-19 variant, rotating out of high-priced technology shares and into names linked to the recovering economy.\n*****\n&gt; Here\u2019s what was influencing the markets to start the week:\n&gt; * Shares linked to the economic reopening gained in Monday premarket trading like energy, industrials and airlines.\n&gt; * Investors continued to sell tech stocks with relatively high valuations. Those shares dragged the market down to a losing week on Wall Street last week.\n&gt; * The 10-year Treasury yield rebounded after falling last week amid the omicron threat.\n&gt; * There\u2019s a major shift underway at the Federal Reserve to bring about a faster end to its pandemic easing policies.\n&gt; * Bitcoin lost $10,000 since Friday, including a sudden drop overnight from Friday to Saturday. The move showed decreasing risk appetite and is hitting related tech stocks.\n&gt; * Dow futures gained 223 points, or 0.8%, while Nasdaq-100 futures shed 0.2% in early Monday trading. S&amp;P 500 futures were higher by 0.3%.\n*****\n&gt; High-priced tech shares were lower in premarket trading, continuing a de-risking theme in markets. Nvidia was off by nearly 3% in premarket trading. Tesla fell about 2%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cSuper-cap tech has been well bid on the expectation of \u2018forever\u2019 low rates and support,\u201d said Tom Essaye, author of the Sevens Report, \u201cbut with the prospect of rates rising and this new Fed paradigm, we are seeing investors rotate out of tech and into sectors with better exposure to higher growth.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He added that it was the Fed that pulled the market back late last week, and not fears about the omicron variant.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cTech pulled the entire market lower. Essentially, we are seeing a sort of Taper Tantrum 2.0 as markets react to a more hawkish Fed and rotate into sectors with more positive exposure to rising rates,\u201d Essaye said.\n*****\n&gt; On Friday, the Nasdaq Composite slid 1.92% with shares of Tesla as the biggest drag. Cathie Wood\u2019s flagship Ark Innovation Fund fell more than 5% Friday, and all of the fund\u2019s holdings are now in a bear market apart from two stocks. Teladoc Health, Zoom Video, Roku, Palantir and Twilio are some of the names that have registered steep losses.\n*****\n&gt; Ark Innovation was down another 2% in premarket trading Monday.\n*****\n&gt; Last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell unnerved markets by signaling the Fed\u2019s focus was inflation, even with the new variant emerging.\n*****\n&gt; Comments by Fed officials suggest that the Fed is likely to decide to double the pace of its taper to $30 billion a month at its meeting next week, CNBC\u2019s Steve Liesman reported on Monday. Initial discussions could also begin as soon as the December meeting about when to raise interest rates and by how much next year.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks linked to the reopening of the economy gained on Monday, boosting sentiment on Dow futures. Boeing and Chevron shares were in the green.\n*****\n&gt; Delta Airlines shares gained about 2% in premarket trading. Carnival and Wynn Resorts shares were about about 1%. Cruise lines and travel booking stocks were higher too.\n*****\n&gt; Bitcoin traded around $57,000 on Friday morning, but by Saturday had plunged to around $43,000. By Monday the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency had clawed back some of its losses, last trading at around $47,377.\n*****\n&gt; Shares of Coinbase lost more than 4% in premarket trading, while Square declined by about 2%.\n*****\n&gt; Slower-than-expected job growth also contributed to Friday\u2019s selling. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 210,000 last month, the Labor Department said Friday, which was below the 573,000 number economists surveyed by Dow Jones were expecting.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cA softer payrolls print pulled the rug beneath risk sentiment,\u201d TD Securities wrote Friday in a note to clients. As investors fled to safety the yield on the 10-year Treasury dipped to 1.335%, the lowest since Sept. 21.\n*****\n&gt; Friday\u2019s selling wrapped up a volatile week for the major averages as investors evaluated new information about the omicron variant.\n*****\n&gt; All three major averages finished the week in the red, with the Dow registering a fourth straight negative week for the first time since September 2020. The S&amp;P and Nasdaq Composite were both down for a second consecutive week.\n*****\n&gt; Small cap names were hit especially hard, with the Russell 2000 falling 3.86% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cDespite our forecast for a flat year for the S&amp;P 500...we are still bullish on pockets of the market, including small caps,\u201d Bank of America said Friday in a note to clients. \u201cSmall caps are more domestic, more exposed to the services spending recovery, bigger beneficiaries of capex/reshoring and are inexpensive vs. large caps,\u201d the firm added.\n*****\n&gt; However, Bank of America said the potential upside for small caps hinges on Covid cases staying under control.\n*****\n&gt; The omicron variant has now been discovered in at least 15 U.S. states, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told ABC News on Sunday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe know we have several dozen cases and we\u2019re following them closely.
