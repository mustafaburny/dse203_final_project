        "selftext": "**Should you buy Apple stock or has the company run out of growth opportunities? What is my price prediction for Apple in the next years? Read until the end as I reveal my price target for Apple and also what I think will happen in the next couple of days, weeks &amp; months!**\n\n**\\~ Warning! Very Very Long Post\\~**\n\nHello everyone! So, let\u2019s go over some of the latest news on Apple before moving on to some fundamental and technical analysis, predictions and my price target for the stock in the next years.\n\nSo, let\u2019s start with the [news](https://postimg.cc/Xrkwk6rP) that Apple will cut the App Store commission in half for small app developers starting in the next days, this will affect developers who earn less than $1M annually from the App Store Sales. This is likely to lead to a small decline in commission revenues for Apple as around 98% of the app developers will qualify for this tax reduction from 30% to 15%, but all these small developers only contribute to about 5% of the estimated $50B in annual revenues from the App Store, so that would be only a $1.25B loss for the company, that is less than half a % of the company\u2019s total net sales in the last fiscal year.\n\nAlso, these changes may lead to a potential long-term revenue boost, as it is likely this will lead to an increasing creation of apps which will generate more commissions in return.\n\nAlongside this we also saw the company releasing the new MacBook\u2019s with their first in-house [chip](https://postimg.cc/vc39NF7x), which promises faster video and imaging processing [times](https://postimg.cc/CR5Fmj5V), with both [CPU](https://postimg.cc/Y4yLdrMd) and [GPU](https://postimg.cc/xJz8gLsd) performance up to 2 times faster than the latest PC laptop chip using just a fraction of the power consumption, with both of the macbooks promising big improvements in [battery](https://postimg.cc/1fp6y1rz) life. Apple is also [expected](https://postimg.cc/GHrtJ8vc) to roll out even more in-house chips in future products, as they have started the 2-year breakup with Intel chips.\n\nWe also saw Morgan Stanley [upgrading](https://postimg.cc/bZ5qMsSS) their base case to $191 at the end of November, as they have cited record lead times, supply chain forecasts and carriers demand as they expect that the company will sell around 270M iPhone in fiscal year 2021, that\u2019s 50M more than the consensus and almost 30M more than the previous estimate of Morgan Stanley, with an average selling price of 842$, 9% more than the base case, as people tend to chose the more expensive and high tech versions of the lineup in this new 5G cycle.\n\nThe 5G super-cycle, which I believe is on the way, and will continue in the next years, as 5G become more available worldwide, could still be the biggest thing coming right away for the company with 5G smartphones [expected](https://postimg.cc/LJptP88f) to surpass 4G sales by 2024, with the average sale price of the 5G phones also coming down, helping them become more popular. This will also be helped by the recent entry to the Indian [market](https://postimg.cc/7fV6BHNS), as India will probably become the world biggest country in the next decade, this could be a huge opportunity for Apple to start and take away market-share from their competitors like Samsung and Xiaomi which have the biggest market shares right now.\n\nThey also [released](https://postimg.cc/PpWhPy31) an update iPad Pro and an all-new iPad Air in September which will also boost sales in this work-from-home environment that will keep the demand very high for this kind of products, just like the Macs. Alongside the increasing demand from the Wearables, Home &amp; Accessories that include Air Pods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, and many more products.\n\nBut the biggest reasons I believe Apple is poised for continued growth, is primarily due to its services business, as they start to offer more and more services like the Apple ONE [BUNDLE](https://postimg.cc/4777MD3s), which include up to 6 services from (Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, the new Apple Fitness+ and the iCloud service) for a pretty reasonable price in my opinion [starting](https://postimg.cc/BLkDnqzj) from 15$ up to 30$/month, this could be a great option for families and even individuals who use their services a lot.\n\nThe latest services, [Fitness+](https://postimg.cc/cKV4KrsG) just launched in the past days, and is a direct competitor to the likes of Peloton, as the service is available on the iPhone, iPad or even Apple TV. This also makes consumers buy the Apple Watch which syncs to the other devices to show you different information. The Fitness+ app just on its own is 8$/month or 80$/year which is less expensive than Peloton subscription which charges 13$ or even traditional gyms like Planet Fitness at 10$/month.\n\nI think this will be the fastest growing sector for the company, as this aligns with the new macro trends, as the world is moving more and more to a digital approach to almost everything as consumer preferences, with more &amp; more younger people reaching the point in life when they use these services start to align to this increasing digital approach.\n\nWe also shouldn\u2019t forget the Apple Card &amp; Apple Pay service among many others which also seem to gain from the move to digital &amp; contactless payments, as this has been accelerated due to the current situation in the past year.\n\nAnd one last piece of [news](https://postimg.cc/k6BKCVTr), and the most recent one, is that Apple may have fast-tracked the Titan project. The Titan project is targeting a 2024 or 2025 push to develop an electric vehicle with advanced battery technologies, that will deliver significant increases in range at much lower costs than the current technologies while also offering self-driving capabilities.\n\nIt\u2019s reported they will not use the same technology as Tesla Full-Self-Driving feature, but will use LIDAR sensors, similar to those that we can find in the latest iPhone 12 PRO.\n\nI think Apple can go 2 ways with this project, they can either use the huge amount of cash the company has to buy another car-maker like Ford, GM or any other car manufacturer expect Tesla and Toyota which do have a big market cap, so that they can fast-track the potential manufacturing of cars, or they can enter into a partnership with big companies like Tesla, Volkswagen or any other car marker to either produce cars or license their technology to this other car-makers which would ultimately and probably have higher margin-returns than the effective manufacturing of cars. Apple\u2019s current overall [gross margins](https://postimg.cc/ykv1mfVP) stand at 38% vs the 15% average of the world top 10 automakers by market cap, which is significantly lower.\n\nBut this Apple Car thing is so far out, and there are so many unknowns, I will not try to predict anything related to this until there is more clarity on the subject.\n\nAnd last, before moving on to some predictions, here are some of the highlights that we heard from the latest investors conference meeting, as the CEO, Tim Cook [expressed](https://postimg.cc/TyhpLzgg) optimism ahead with the launch of many new products and services, especially the Home Pod Mini and the new 5G iPhones, as these new iPhones include new LIDAR scanners that greatly improve the camera capabilities, as the iPhone as seen very positive reviews. We also saw the Senior VP and CFO, Luca Maestri give us great [outlook](https://postimg.cc/DWDmqxPD) for the company as they expect the installed devices base to continue to growth despite already being at an all-time high as they have over 585M paid subscriptions on their platforms and expect this to surpass 600M by the end of 2020.\n\nI also researched and found what products we can see in the near future, with the first half of [2021](https://postimg.cc/jCBQsXVM) bringing new iMacs, the AirPods3 and the iPad Pro, while in the [FALL](https://postimg.cc/8jVJKngg) event we will probably get the new iPhone 13 alongside the iPhone SE PLUS and the Watch Series 7 with more products coming [later](https://postimg.cc/GHc3s01t) in 2021 or that don\u2019t have an estimated release date like the Air Pods Pro, the Air Tags and the iPad Mini 6.\n\nSo, before even starting, you should now that I am bull on Apple but I am willing to hear other opinions so don\u2019t be afraid to leave a comment down below.\n\nI have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the [company](https://postimg.cc/JHRDpPGQ), the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research.\n\nThis are my 2025 projections for Apple, let\u2019s take a closer look at them, each on their own.\n\nSo, in term of revenues, Apple has 5 big sources of income, which saw an overall increase of 6% despite lagging sales in the iPhone. The biggest revenue is by far the iPhone right now with over $137B in revenue in the fiscal year ending in September. I expect to see the iPhone sales increasing in the next years, especially in 2021, with the new 5G iPhone creating a super-cycle for the [company](https://postimg.cc/XGfBKT7J), as most iPhone users, including myself here, as I will upgrade from my iPhone X, will switch to this new product. The iPhone sales have decreased in the last couple of years by 14% and 3% as a result of the product not having big improvements, as well as iPhone usually starting to last longer than previous models, so I expect to see a 12% increase in sales next year and a gradual decrease in the growth of sales as more people upgrade, ending with just a 5% growth in iPhone [sales](https://postimg.cc/V0wfRpr7) in 2025.\n\nThe next revenues stream is from the Mac, which has seen an increase in the past 2years, with revenues topping $28B this year after the huge demand from the work from home consumers. I [expect](https://postimg.cc/1405tm2b) this trend to continue as they plan to continue to launch better products and I can see the company having a similar growth next year before starting to decline slightly until 2025, also ending with a 5% growth.\n\nThe iPad is currently the smallest revenue stream for Apple but has also seen an increase in demand in the past 2 years with a 13% average increase in revenues. I also expect the iPad to continue to grow in the next couple of years, especially with the learn-from-home environment for kids, and even after this period ends, the transformation for learning will implicate more digital usage. I [expect](https://postimg.cc/5XKtVsT0) the iPad to see some similar growth to the Macs, especially with the latest generation also bringing a new iPad air to the market.\n\nThe 4th revenue stream and the fastest growing in the past 2 years, with an average growth of 33% are the wearables, home &amp; accessories revenues. This have topped $30B this year, as Apple has also just launched the Apple Watch series 6 and also feature other great products like Apple TV, the Air Pods the Home Pod and the Home Pod mini alongside other third-party accessories.\n\nI gave this [revenue](https://postimg.cc/v4C4JQ4T) stream a growth of 20% starting next year with a gradual decrease to around 8% by 2025, as I believe this will become more &amp; more popular as they start to offer more vertical integration.\n\nAnd last, but by no means least, the revenue stream that I expect to grow the most and the fastest is the revenue from the services that Apple offers. This includes revenues from Apple Care, Advertising, Cloud Services, Payment Services like Apple Card &amp; Apple Pay and of course the digital content which includes fees from the App Store alongside subscription-based income including the new Apple One Bundle and Apple Fitness+ alongside the already know Apple Arcade, Apple Music, Apple News+, Apple TV+ and hopefully I don\u2019t forget any others.\n\nSo, I [expect](https://postimg.cc/svV7mDWR) this to become the clear 2nd biggest revenue stream for Apple by 2025, as I expect this to grow more than 20% next year, mainly due to the Apple One Bundle and Apple Fitness+ followed up by a slightly decreasing growth, ending with a 10% increase in revenues in 2025.\n\nI think this are fairly conservative base case scenarios for the revenues, as I expect them to continue to increase the [other](https://postimg.cc/1VFFgkxJ) revenue streams and not have such a large percentage of the revenues coming from the iPhone sales as you can see in this chart.\n\nIn terms of expenses, I pretty much kept the same margins as in previous years, with a 68% expense ratio on product sales \\[ [iPhone](https://postimg.cc/JDZ7jMnD) / [iPad](https://postimg.cc/Wd14CB9C) / [Mac](https://postimg.cc/q6GkZw2p) / [WHA](https://postimg.cc/211q9q8g) \\] and 35% expense ratio on [SERVICES](https://postimg.cc/8sdLLrjH), as this are way more lucrative.\n\nIn the past 3 years, the products [gross margin](https://postimg.cc/ykv1mfVP) was 32.7%, so I actually imply bigger expenses for the manufacturing and sales of products, as this is mostly impacted by the company\u2019s supplier\u2019s ability to make up for and demand, while for the services revenue, the gross margins for the last 3 years has been 63.5% on average, but I expect this to be more in-line with the 66% margin in this past year. So, if services manage to grow to about half the revenues from the iPhone, this will effectively double the gross revenues, as every buck gained in the service revenues account for 2$ in the product sales.\n\nSo, I expect the total [revenues](https://postimg.cc/sMjByQ2n) for Apple to increase from $274B in 2020 to over $440B by 2025, increasing by approximately 10%/year, while I will keep the expense ratio pretty much in-line and have them increasing by 11%/year, this would bring the total gross income for Apple to $177B, increasing mainly due to the services revenues as I said earlier. This growth is just above the 4year [average](https://postimg.cc/Tp8g83mS), and below the 2018 levels, which we might see again with this 5G super-cycle and explosive growth in the services revenue.\n\nI also think the company will continue to invest in both Capital Expenditure and Operating expenses.\n\nI think the operating expenses will remain pretty much in line with the [previous](https://postimg.cc/2qBCfrnc) years, as this number has increased by 1% [annually](https://postimg.cc/Fd5JL9v8) both in R&amp;D and SG&amp;A. So, I will keep the exact percentages from previous years, as I expect the revenue to increase, thus I don\u2019t see a big increase percentage wise. This would account for over $60B in operating expenses by 2025 and over $11B in Capital Expenditures by 2025, as I expect this to increase, mainly due to the possible EV developments or investments in self-driving capabilities alongside other manufacturing capabilities. You can see that the Capex [spending](https://postimg.cc/yDsRdpLy) has been decreasing in the past years with just over $8.8B in payments for business acquisitions and the other traditional Capex spending. Some people may use the cash generated by [investing](https://postimg.cc/Mn9nG6Mz) activities as Capex, but that is more unreliable. I also can see the Capex going back up, so I wanted to be safe and implied a 10% growth.\n\nThis money would account for over $73B in [expenses](https://postimg.cc/dZnY91K1) and would bring the profit for the company to almost $104B before interest and taxes.\n\nMoving on, let\u2019s see what interest income and expenses the [company](https://postimg.cc/cgy0x2ms) has had in the past few years. We can see a decrease in interest expense in the past few years as the company has been paying off debt, but they have also been generating less money in this department, with an overall decrease in this department of more than 50% in the past year, way less than the amount from 2018. So, for safety reasons, I used a 10% decline in both income and expenses [related](https://postimg.cc/QKgtZhZG) to interest, while increasing the other losses by 10%/year.\n\nThis would bring the company pre-tax income to just over $104B in 2025.\n\nLet\u2019s move on to taxes. I know the Federal income tax rate is 21% for the [company](https://postimg.cc/ykY39pq1), but the actual effective tax rate for the company was lower than 15% in the past year, mainly due to lower tax-rates on foreign earnings alongside tax-benefits and tax-settlements. The average effective tax rate has been just over 16% in the past 3 years, but with more and more of the revenues coming from outside the US, I think it\u2019s safe to say that the company will have around a 15% effective tax rate by 2025, this obviously if nothing major changes in tax policy around the world.\n\nSo, Apple would [have](https://postimg.cc/Wqc3ytKw) $88.6B in income after tax by 2025 and with the current outstanding shares standing at just under 17B, so I don\u2019t even account for the company probably continuing to do share buybacks, this would mean a $5.22 [future](https://postimg.cc/4YytCLwL) earnings/share. And with today\u2019s price for Apple just around 136$, that would mean to [company](https://postimg.cc/RNf1qH44) is trading at just over 26 times forward price to earnings.\n\nI don\u2019t think Apple will ever trade at a discount again, with the current PE [standing](https://postimg.cc/RqwqHQ6s) at over 40, I believe this will eventually go down, probably to around 35, despite the increase in services revenue, which is highly valued by investors. I think we can see Apple trade somewhere near 35 [times](https://postimg.cc/5H98PKv2) P/E in 2025, especially if something big happens with the EV project, this could be even higher, just look at Tesla which trades at [insane](https://postimg.cc/sBZhxMk5) P/E. Of course, we also have to take into consideration the dividends that will be received from owning the stock, as Apple has started to pay dividends almost a decade ago and has 9 years of dividend growth, with a 10% annual rate of [growth](https://postimg.cc/CnbZMbD2) in the past 5 years. [Here](https://postimg.cc/7CLT1G8C) is the dividend growth history for the company, as I also went conservative on this [estimate](https://postimg.cc/Tp7LcjGr) and implied a 7% growth for the next 2 years, 6% for 2023 and 2024 and just 5% in 2025.\n\nSo [here](https://postimg.cc/R3PK21QQ) are my 3 price targets for the company, [including](https://postimg.cc/JHR8JXvv) dividends but not reinvested. My bear case scenario is that Apple will trade at almost 165$ which implies a [return](https://postimg.cc/jCYzWhd2) of over 21% by 2025, while my base case scenario would see Apple trading at 195$ with a return of capital of 43%. I will also make the bull case for Apple trading at 225$ by 2025 with dividends included, which would imply just over 65% in gains by then.\n\nI think this is possible as Apple has also [continued](https://postimg.cc/fJj36jMt) to buy back shares of the company on a constant basis, as they continue to an impressive campaign with over $72B worth of common stock repurchased in 2020. They continue to buy back shares at a very fast pace, having repurchased over 1.3M shares in 2019 and 2018, while also issuing less stock every year.\n\nSo here is the full [spreadsheet](https://postimg.cc/Z995KrzL) that I have projected for Apple by 2025 and the breakdown of everything i estimated \\[ [1](https://postimg.cc/jCT7qdZJ) / [2](https://postimg.cc/DmcbSkMp) \\] , if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.\n\nKeep in mind, these targets might sound ridiculous, but just [look](https://postimg.cc/V50nHCSn) at the growth Apple has had in the last 5years. The company has increased in value by more 400% in just the past 5years and is over 100.000% up since it started trading. So yes, the valuation is mad right now for the company. So, are you willing to bet against Apple?\n\nThe company also has pristine [financials](https://postimg.cc/LYcYMxqf), with more than $65B in total assets compared to total liabilities, and more than $38B in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nSo, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for Apple?\n\nLet\u2019s look at this [CHART](https://postimg.cc/7592T1c8), so starting with the stock split, Apple saw a correction within the September stock market pullback, in a buy the news &amp; sell the event, after a huge runup post-announcement of the stock split. The stock entered a consolidation period, and didn\u2019t have any big catalysts, especially with new iPhone lineup not being included in the Q4 results due to the late launch. The stock found some levels of resistance near the $120 levels that it struggled to get past but acted also as support after breaking them just before the recent news of the possible EV developments or self-driving-features to be licensed to other car manufacturers. After that news the stock spiked and has now reached the previous highs made before the stock split and is facing some resistance, if the stock pushes over $140 I think we can officially say that it broke the resistance at those levels and is not just a fake-out. But I think it\u2019s likely that the stock will consolidate between 122 and 135$ in the next weeks until the next iPhone sales and quarterly results are released, as the stock has entered overbought territory again with an RSI over 70, the first time since the stock split.\n\nSo, what would I do? Well, I own Apple stock, and I really believe this company will remain the biggest or one of the biggest in the future, so I would really add on any weakness that the stock shows before the next quarter earnings are released, as typically Q1 [earnings](https://postimg.cc/V5t0FPTF) are the best for the company due to increased holiday sales combined with the launch of new products. I think any entry below 130$ would be really nice to start and build a position or increase it if you already own the stock. As I believe Apple is one of the most stable stocks out there with large institutional [holders](https://postimg.cc/3kqG3XcK) like Vanguard, BlackRock and Berkshire owning over 900M shares each.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "So a lot has happened with the shares.  \n\nThe wedge looks like it has broken down, but it could easily be just an extension of a wedge. The point is that we don't have a full breakdown unless we spend considerable time below 25, then I could maybe see things fall back down to 20. I think it is far more likely we just remain in this extended consolidation phase of 25-30 until we get some sort of a catalyst or a short squeeze. \n\nBut this is not the point of the post today. Today I am here to convince you why a cost basis of 20 or 25 doesn't matter for PLTR. You are buying buying the company at around 40-50x 2020E sales, Which seems quite high  (not as much compared to SNOW and some other big data plays) but still. So why bother with PLTR?\n\nBefore I proceed, I know most people who read my posts can't read, and I am going to be dropping a gigantic wall of text, so here is the short form  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ddzg718of5861.png?width=1224&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58b39c19f793dee8366fc2bafbc55bfe49d49836\n\nThis was the primer I had written on Information Technology  back in 2017\n\n[https://etherealvalue.wordpress.com/2017/02/25/technology-primer/](https://etherealvalue.wordpress.com/2017/02/25/technology-primer/)  \n\nI started by looking at the S&amp;P500 since the early 1900s to understand if there was a mental model I could use to outperform the index. What I found was that starting in the late 1800s, most of the companies that ended up creating enormous shareholder value started as technology companies. Dupont was a technology company in the 1800s, Edison Electric was a technology company in the 1900s, GM was a technology company in the 1920s. If one looks at the market capitalization of companies today, many of the largest are today\u2019s technology companies: Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft have market capitalizations which eclipse many old traditional industries.\n\nThere is clearly something about technology companies that allows them to generate enormous shareholder value and create wealth for society, after all, if\u00a0the stock index was still dominated by the likes of American Cotton Oil and American Sugar Refining like in the 1900s, we would all be living in a different and much poorer world. The challenge with investing in technology companies is that for every Edison Electric there is a Zenith Radio. for every IBM there is a Sinclaire Rearch and for every Apple there is a Blackberry. There had to be a way to analyze or put into context why some companies last longer than others and why some managed to generate returns over a thousand fold for its investors while others fizzile and pop with the latest turn in the economic cycle.\n\nI agree with Peter Thiel\u2019s thesis that technology advancement is probably slowing down and primarily concentrated around information technology as a result of regulations around the \u201cworld of stuff\u201d. I believe this will continue to be the trend of the next 20-30 years, with some exceptions and that the rise of AI may start creating innovation again in many static fields. I believe historically, there were massive innovation happening across multiple disciplines from the 1800s-1950s, where technological progress branched \u00a0out like a tree and\u00a0built on itself. Since the 1970s or so, this branch narrowed \u00a0into only a few sectors, primarily focused in information technology.\n\nSo I wanted to strip out the massive amount innovations that have taken place around agriculture, communications, transportation, energy and petrochemicals over the past 100 years. It is helpful to think backwards if you will, focusing on just the age of computers and back into the late 1800s, into the birth of the electronic age. When we focus on just the computer led revolution in the 1950s and electricity revolution in the 1870s, we start seeing some interesting trends.\n\n**Information Technology Cycles**\n\nThe following is my attempt at\u00a0describing from a very high level the history of computing and informational technology. What I found was that technology moves both in cycles of proliferation and consolidation and that there is a directional theme.\n\nElectronic Age  \n**Electricity/Scaled Power (1875-1900):** Platform competition and consolidation phase: Edison vs Tesla. Enterprise facing, originally to convince government and factory owners to replace\u00a0physical labor.  \n(Important companies: GE and Westinghouse)\n\n**Electronics (1900-1925):** Electricity prices fall as infrastructure rollout, creating a proliferation of electronic hobbyists and startups. Hardware dominates first half, platform dominates next half. Consumer Facing.  \n(Important companies: RCA, Zenith, Galvin (Motorola), most went belly up, upstream and downstream do well)\n\n**Electronics Consolidation (1925-1950):** The electronics sector consolidates, with content platform operators (software) dominating, and winners usually emerge from previously niche targets.  \n(Important companies: AT&amp;T, NBC, IBM)\n\nComputing/Software Age  \n**Computing/Scaled Electronic (1950-1975):** Platform consolidation: IBM and the seven dwarfs. Enterprise facing, originally to convince government and large scale enterprise to replace\u00a0\u00a0basic mental labor.  \n(Important companies: IBM)\n\n**From Hardware to Software (1975-2000):** Computing price falls, creating a proliferation of hobbyists, IT startups and companies. Lots of PC makers who go bust, software and internet dominate in the second half.  \n(Important companies: Intel, Microsoft, Apple, Dell, most early PC makers go belly up, up and downstream do well)\n\n**Software Consolidation (2000-2025):** Sectors like Retail, information and social consolidate. Hardware continues to fall away to software as content platform start to dominate, winner is emerging across multiple sub verticals.  \n(Important companies: Amazon, Apple, Alibaba, Tencent)\n\nCloud/AI Age  \n**Machine Learning (ML)/Smart Software (2025-2050):** Platform consolidation phase. Enterprise facing, convince companies this is the future of advanced mental labor. It will be about the use of AI at the industrial scale being adapted by corporations and governments for various analytical, resource management and decision making processes.  \n(Candidate Important companies**:** AWS, Microsoft,\u00a0Palantir, companies yet to exist in China)\n\n**Specialized AI\u00a0(2050-2075):** Machine learning/AI becomes cheaper, creating a proliferation of AI hobbyists and developers, high level programing focused, consumer facing. This will be about the proliferation of AI in our everyday lives. Just as how starting in the 1990s, the story of technology was one with the integration of computers and software to our daily lives, to some extent, outsourcing\u00a0the memory/logic processing components of our lives to computers. Now, we will be calling upon multiple AIs to do many deal of the functions of our lives in perhaps faster input times (using neural interfaces). Companies\u00a0and products could be formed in seconds from simply thinking through the process and outsourcing it to smart software who functionally construct its various\u00a0parts in second to minutes depending on how quickly you can direct and scale your digital minions to do your bidding.  \n(Candidate important companies: most will go bust, up and downstream will likely do well.)\n\n**General AI (2075-2100):**\u00a0Consolidation of Software/AI. It will be about the web linkages of human/AI integration. Whether this looks like some sort of neural net where we live in a web of information buffeted by our web of AI advisors.\n\nThe average core technology cycle seems to be approximately 75 years, with 25 years of infrastructure platform competition and roll-out, 25 years of new venture creation most of which gets washed out, and 25 years of industry consolidation.\n\nThe initial phase of the cycle is dominated by 1-3 players fighting it out in a standards war that then gets rolled out as the foundational infrastructure of the next 50 years:\n\nIn the initial phase, the general theme is that the companies start off as enterprise and government facing. In the historical electronics and computer cycle, there has been two such periods, the roll out of electrical grid by GE/Westinghouse and the roll out of mainframe computers by IBM. In the case of the AC vs DC standard war between Edison and Tesla, both men through their respective backers, GE and Westinghouse, to invent and supply standardized power equipment and build power plant, the initial consumers were local government to replace previous gas lamp systems with electrical street lamps and to factories. The new technology was seen as cheaper and more efficient than previously gas operated lambs operated by cities and more importantly, electricity delivered by wire is seen as much more efficient than having onsite power for factory operators, allowing for the displacement of onsite steam engines and boilers. The birth of the mainframe computer was similar, although less competitive. Due to an earlier lead and first mover position, IBM was able to dominate the market over its competitors, making them irrelevant. The mainframe computer was sold to large corporations and government defense agencies for the calculation of complex formulas that had previously required the employment of hundreds of staff. The two initial cycles produce two monopolistic businesses that are still DOW components today, GE and IBM, which set the standard for a drop in the price of electricity and computing that would benefit the next phase of the cycle.\n\nThe proliferation phase, the general theme is that there is a cheapening of the previous platform technology, electricity and computing power, which enables hobbyists to take advantage and start building new products in the electronics and PC space. This is characterized by period of high new firm creation, high levels of creativity and a move from enterprise focus to the consumer. We saw it in the 1900-1920s with the birth of the electronics industry, there were dozens of radio makers, appliance makers and various electronics manufacturing startups. During this time, there was heavy competition from the host of new hardware businesses, with most profits coming from IP licensing. A similar analogy could be made of the PC era of the 1980s-2000s, there was a lot of hardware makers, it was highly competitive, and the winners of the era were primarily focusing on software (ie Microsoft).\n\nThe consolidation phase, In the case of the 1920s, the commoditization of hardware created an opportunity for content providers. History is littered with names of large scale manufacturer that are now defuct, names like Zenith, admiral and dozens of electronics makers which use to hover mid-western industrial hubs such as Chicago. The content providers in Radio and TV became more dominant. Through the current consolidation phase, starting in 2000, we see less new venture creation and generally a focus on the content/distribution platform side of consumer technology. Amazon, Netflix, Google, Apple are key examples of the shift.\n\nWhat it means today,\n\nI would argue that we are in the consolidation part of the cycle until 2020-2025, where it will continue to be about shrinking number of consumer technology players and the dominance of content over infrastructure. This explains the phenomenal\u00a0increase of FANG stocks relative to the rest of the market. As a result, for the next 5-10 years, if one can pick good entry points for Amazon (I will discuss my dislike of Google in a future post), one will be successful, and the company will likely last for a long time. It remains to be seen if Apple can create a bigger ecosystem. Contrarian value plays probably revolve around Chinese ADRs which are out of favor with the US public.\n\n**From 2025 onward, the most exciting prospect is the idea of a repeat of the infrastructure buildout that happened at the onset of the electricity and computing age. I believe that the new phase will be targeting enterprise and government and will be a winner take all fight similar to the few cycles. The previous cycles revolved around scaled mechanical energy and scaled linear mental processing, I believe the next phase will revolve around advanced mental processing. I think that corporations and government while benefiting from scale, are beholden to inefficient decision making due to complicated management structuring.** The automation of complex management process that can analyze of complex large data and deploy resources more efficiently will become invaluable to large corporate/government clients. Companies that have potential in this space are big data players with big client channels like AWS and **Palantir** or emergent players which have yet to develop in the US or China. It is also possible that will come from a spinout team from one of current tech giants.\n\nIt is a serious mistake to continue to look for consumer plays in the technology space. I believe that the sector is consolidating and played out. New entrants will find it nearly impossible to survive at the downturn of the next cycle and current incumbents will solidity their positioning. The next batch of potentially interesting companies will likely come from the enterprise space. While Wall Street analysts continues to be focused on AWS and the fight over IaaS and PaaS, the most interesting\u00a0segment to watch is in advanced analytics and resource allocation tools, which is ripe for innovation. There are lots of fat in the middle management layer of corporations and governments. I strongly believe that this space is where the next once in a generation infrastructure player (like GE and IBM) can offer an impressive solution which will fill the niche. The early identification of this company/companies will generate significant out performance relative to any market benchmark.\n\n2020 Update:\n\nIf we are in the infrastructure roll-out stage than first mover absolutely has an advantage as we could see with GE, IBM and microsoft to some extent during the previous eras. In the consolidation ages, the last mover had an advantage. Amazon and Apple were not the first e-commerce or hardware makers, but are likely the last because they benefit from  a slow down of technology and a focus on ease of use and scale.  This is why every contract and sticky ones PLTR has is so important, because these relationships will scale in a non-linear way once AI and machine learning starts making its way into  large institutions and first mover advantage is very very important here, just like how GE was working around the clock to sign on factories and local governments for lighting and electricity contracts, once they were in, that is forever.  \n\nI have very high conviction on Palantir.  I believe the reason above s is what drove Peter Thiel to invest into Palantir, because it is building the infrastructure layer for the age of AI and PLTR is primed to becoming the single most important company in technology for the next 2-3 decades and will be a 100-1,000x bagger.  Also  to assuage of rumors, I am not Peter Thiel or Mike Green.\n\nPosition Update;  \nNow have $220k in shares  (bought another \\~$90k in shares yesterday, still about 30k (down from 50k) in calls. I fully expect to lose all my call value.  If it drops to 20, I'll add another 100k. These shares are long term holds and are the ones to pass down to your children.",

        "selftext": "Thanks to the mods for helping me out in the noob thread. I've experience selling puts and calls but have not been one to purchase options. So I decided to give my first go just doing 1 simple leap in my tIRA and see how it plays out. Thought I would share:\n\nAMD Stock Price (at time of post): $92.70  \nAccount: Traditional IRA  \nOption: CALL ADVANCED MICRO DEVI $60 EXP 01/21/22  \nContracts: 1  \nPrice: $38.20  \nBreakeven Stock Price: $98.20  \nExit Strategy: Best scenario for me is 50% profit; I've an open order to 'Sell to Close' at $57.30. Potentially use proceeds to purchase more AMD LEAPS at same expiration but deeper ITM strike. Will reevaluate decision if sold. Regardless of profit/loss, I will exit 30 days before expiration.   \nRationale/Bias: I am bullish on AMD and have been for a while. I hold most of my shares in the $55-$60 range in my brokerage account. AMD is my 2nd most holding after Microsoft. I believe that AMD microchips are superior to Intel chips and they've been gaining marketspace for a while and will continue to do so. New business partnerships and continued growth in the 5G boom will also give AMD more business growth. Additionally, I am overall positive about the market next year as the Fed keeps \"printing money\" and keeping interest rates low so AMD should benefit from that push. Lastly, once AMD reaches $100 stock price, I believe support will be there to hold that position. Bullish sentiment appears everywhere with AMD: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-chip-stocks-more-100-154303385.html  I'm obviously biased but if anyone had bear reasons for AMD, I'd be interested to hear them.

        "selftext": "Disclaimer: Copied from [this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/ChrisBloomstran/status/1340414130658820096) by **Christopher Bloomstran**  \n\n\nLet\u2019s get ready to tumble! Come Monday, $TSLA enters the S&amp;P 500, as the world is aware. This is the one you will tell your grandkids about, or at least the new crop of investors, wondering what the bubble of 2020 was like. Tesla can be your example of the insanity....1/ \n\nFor all of the cost-saving benefits of passive investing, the Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s committee that actively chooses the components for its indices will prove why passive investors are the dumb money with this coming Monday\u2019s inclusion of $TSLA into its venerable S&amp;P 500 index. 2/ \n\nThe committee is not known for a price consciousness. It chases what\u2019s hot and eliminates from its august roster what\u2019s not. 3/ \n\nIt\u2019s disregard for fundamentals or value was seen sharply in late 1999 &amp; early 2000 when bubble darlings like Peoplesoft, New Century Energy, Global Crossing, Xilinx, Teradyne, Quintiles Transnational, Citrix and JDS Uniphase made their way into the index. 4/ \n\nPull up the long-term charts to see how these \u201ctimely\u201d additions fared post admittance. The most prominent additions in 1999 were America Online (discussed in my 12/5 thread) and Yahoo, whose mania also reminds me of Tesla... 5/ \n\nYahoo went public in 1996, priced at $13 per share, opened at $24.50 and closed at $33 on its first trading day, a market cap of $850 million. From there the shares zoomed ahead by more than 6x in 2 years reaching $354 in January 1999. 6/ \n\nThe company then bought Geocities for $3.6B and Broadcast for $5.7B and the stock was more than cut in half, trading down to $120. Recovering by late 1999, the wizards at S&amp;P announced they would add Yahoo to the index on 11/30/1999. 7/ \n\nThe stock climbed 67% from $210 on the day of the announcement to $350 on the day of its inclusion on 12/7, one week later. Sound familiar? The rollercoaster didn\u2019t high point for another month. 8/ \n\nYahoo peaked not quite a month later at a share price of $475, a market cap of $127B on January 3, 2000 (the cap didn\u2019t include another 124 million option shares, 38M granted in 1999 alone, which implied an additional \\~$50B in market cap on January 3, 2000). 9/ \n\nIn hindsight, or for anyone with reason, which was lacking in those days, there was no need to count the fully diluted shares. Why? Those options would not be exercised. The stock fell 98.3% over the next 1 \u00be years, from $475 to $8.11 on 9/26/2001, a market cap of $2.2B. Yep. 10/ \n\nAt the peak, Yahoo's $127B market cap compared to $600 million in trailing 12-month revenues, so 211 times revenues. 11/ \n\nBut the Yahoo and tech bulls would get right in your face (or on the Yahoo Finance message board) and tell you, moron, that sales had grown 141%, 248%, 258% and 1,345% in the prior 4 years, which they did. 12/ \n\nHeck, even after the stock dropped from a STOCK PRICE of $475 to $30 (a mere 93.7% in a year for those counting) by the end of 2000, sales still GREW by 88% to $1.1B, to \u201conly\u201d 15 times revenues! From there, however, the company flailed. 13/ \n\nSales actually fell 35%, from $1.1B to $717m from 2000 to 2001, which is what drove the shares down to $8.11 and a $2.2B market cap. To what had been the first and dominant home page, and really the dominant search engine, competition came fast. 14/ \n\nYahoo even eventually outsourced its search function to upstart Google if you can believe that. Yahoo did ultimately grow its revenues another 5x to $5B by 2016, when it was bought by Verizon $VZ in 2016 for $4.5B, excluding a sub's partial investment in Alibaba. 15/ \n\nThe buyout was at a far cry from the day Yahoo came into the S&amp;P 500 as the 30th largest capitalization in the index, with a market cap of roughly $90B and I\u2019d guess at a weight of 0.7%. 16/ \n\nAt its January 3, 2000 peak, Yahoo had climbed to the #15 spot in the index, well ahead of Berkshire Hathaway $BRKA $BRKB (which was not yet in the index despite its mere $83B market cap, $131B in assets and $38B in shareholders equity.) 17/ \n\nHad Berkshire been in the index the day Yahoo peaked it would have held only the 37 spot, behind notorious tech darlings Cisco at $358B, Intel $290B, Time Warner $184B, Lucent $171B Sun Mico $168B, AT&amp;T $160B, WorldCom $148B, Dell $130B, HP $120B, Oracle $120B, EMC $116B,... 18/ \n\nQualcomm $116B, DirecTV $102B, Verizon $93B, AOL $93B, Motorola $90B, and Bellsouth $87B. Many of these are gone today, which leads us back to $TSLA. 19/ \n\nNever has the S&amp;P 500 committee brought in a company so large by market cap as will be the case with Tesla's inclusion. Nor have they ever brought in a company at so high a spot in the cap-weighted index, at #6, one notch ahead of Berkshire Hathaway. Insanity. 20/ \n\nOf course, by sales &amp; profits, plenty of companies have entered the index as larger constituents, but that\u2019s not what counts in the passive index. It\u2019s all about float adjusted market cap. Fundamental valuation matters not. Qualifying for index inclusion required some hijinks.21/ \n\nTesla had cut R&amp;D &amp; SG&amp;A, drew on reserves and leaned on environmental carbon credits to \u201cearn\u201d a GAAP profit for a necessary four quarters. They did so for five. Oddly, revenues only grew 15% in 2019, prior to the pandemic, in part for a reduction in customer tax incentives. 22/ \n\nImpressively, they have grown revenues 15% for the first 9 months of 2020 during the crisis while the incumbents saw sales decline. No doubt the business is growing. But how to value it? 23/ \n\nOn November 16, the S&amp;P index committee announced Tesla would be added on December 21. The market cap was $380B. Here on Saturday December 19, the stock price at $695 yields a market cap of $659B ($BRK, the current #6 is $528B) up $279B or 73% since the announcement. 24/ \n\nThe gain matches the percentage rise seen by Yahoo during the week between its announcement &amp; addition. The $279B gain is LARGER than the $215B market cap of the world\u2019s largest auto manufacturer, Toyota. Tesla\u2019s $659B cap is on 948M shares out at 9/30 (up 5% since YE 2019). 25/ \n\nThe share count excludes another 157M unvested or unexercised option and RSU shares, which would add more than $100B to the market cap on a fully diluted basis. 26/ \n\nLet\u2019s not count those for the same reason they were excluded in the Yahoo calculation. Why? Many may go unexercised. Why? Nobody in their right mind would pay $659B, $760B diluted, for a car co w/ $30B in sales, little or no economic profit and an enormous growth capital need.27/ \n\n25x sales? 2,030x GAAP earnings? 422x earnings assuming Toyota\u2019s best in industry 6% profit margin? Heck, even 85 times Microsoft\u2019s 30% profit margin (a bone for the Tesla is not a car company but also a software/robotaxi crowd). Welcome to the game, index fund investors. 28/ \n\n80% of Tesla\u2019s shares float, not owned by insiders, which means the adjusted market cap weight will be $528B, compelling somewhere between $50 and $75B of direct index purchases, not to mention those needed by index huggers and closet indexers. 29/ \n\nThe stock will come in at \\~1.75% of the $30.5 trillion index, itself significantly overvalued, not unlike when Yahoo peaked in January 2000 and the index peaked at over 30x earnings and 44x cyclically adjusted (CAPE) shortly thereafter. 30/ \n\nWhat prospective return does the Tesla bull expect, or the passive investor with 1.75% of capital in the shares come Monday? At 15% a year, the market cap, assuming no further dilution, grows to $3T over the next decade, \\~10% of the market value of the entire S&amp;P 500 today. 31/ \n\nAt \u201conly\u201d 10% per year, the fully diluted market cap grows to $2 trillion, almost where $AAPL is valued these days. At a 10% shareholder return, to trade at 30x earnings, Tesla will need to be earning $67 billion. 32/ \n\nFor grins let\u2019s assume the company actually earns some blend of auto maker profit (most earn \\~3%, Toyota \\~6%) and a subscription software, robotaxi margin of 30%. Generously call it a 20% blended profit margin, which I\u2019d bet heavily against. 33/ \n\nAt the impossible 20% margin, $67B would sit under $335B in revenues, roughly 11 times today\u2019s run rate. Revenues will need to grow by almost 28% per year, and profits to 20% of revenues, to get to a 30x multiple on earnings. 34/ \n\nTo finance the necessary capital stock to produce $335B in revenues will require about half that much in capital, either debt or equity. 35/ \n\nCar companies require roughly a dollar in capital to produce a dollar in revenues, but remember we are \"assuming\" this is a software company or whatever else hallucinogens conjure up in the minds of bulls. 36/ \n\nThe best course of action for Tesla is to keep selling \u201cat-the-market\u201d blocks, with no prospectus, road show or risk warning, to the dumb money that is willing, or compelled, as is the passive crowd, to pay dangerous prices. The dilution at today\u2019s prices is infinitesimal. 37/ \n\nThrough the end of 2019 Tesla had sold $12.7B in shares and borrowed $16B in debt and preferred stock. Total capital raised of $28B exceeded FY 2019 revenues of $25B and produced a $6B cumulative LOSS. 38/ \n\nSo far in 2020, Tesla has borrowed an additional net $200m and sold $12.3B of new shares (assuming a sale of the most recent $5B \u201cat-the-market\u201d). Bulls revere the cash on the balance sheet, but it didn\u2019t come from profit or free cash. 39/ \n\nTotal capital raised is now $40B before retained losses. What does Tesla earn on capital? Nothing yet. Equity is less than capital raised from stock sales by the amount of cumulative losses. Per share book is of course higher thanks to successful stock sales way above book...40/ \n\nFrom a business case and investment standpoint, the math doesn\u2019t work. Consider that total automobiles sold worldwide peaked two years ago at about 95m passenger and commercial car and truck units. At $20,000 per new vehicle, we can call the global auto market $2T in size. 41/ \n\nOur example has Tesla\u2019s market cap growing over the next decade at \u201conly\u201d 10% per year to a like $2T. Car companies, with the exception of Ferrari, which makes three cars per year, don\u2019t trade for one times sales. They trade for less. 42/ \n\nToyota, which earns a 6% margin and 6% on capital, trades itself at an all-time-high $215B on revenues of $280B in 2019, less in 2020. 43/ \n\nAuto manufacturers trade for less than sales because they make \\~3% net margins and earn that same \\~3% on capital and revenues grow at \\~3%. We can call the industry 3x3x3 (new material here folks). The car business is a bad business, and that\u2019s what Tesla is trying to disrupt? 44/ \n\nThe best case for shareholders: If Tesla grows the aforementioned sales for the next decade by 28% to $335B (it won\u2019t), the stock will trade for no more than 1x sales, because it\u2019s a CAR company. 45/ \n\nIf it earns Toyota\u2019s best in class 6% margin, even allowing for software \u201cupgrades,\u201d it earns $20B and trades for 25x, or a $500B market cap, which is a 33% loss from here people using diluted shares. If sales, margins or the multiple are lower, shareholders lose more. 46/ \n\nThe realistic case: The performance of the stock from here is a giant loss over time and the Tesla cult loses interest in the brand. In fact, they come to hate the brand because of their coming stock losses, customer and employee mistreatment. 47/ \n\nAsk the guys and gals on the S and X lines about their unpaid \u201cbreak\u201d here at quarter end. Rumor has it they can \"volunteer their time\" to help boost production before yearend. Sales grow nowhere near 28% a year. The incumbent auto manufacturers won\u2019t roll over and play dead. 48/ \n\nMy prior tweet elaborated on [@elonmusk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk) using his inflated shares as currency to acquire another manufacturer w/ capacity, as he mentioned he\u2019d be up for in a friendly merger of equals. The point of that message was that the incumbents won\u2019t take his dangerous scrip in a deal. 49/ \n\nThat leaves Elon with having to sell new shares perpetually to finance his growth. It makes 100% sense when the shares are insanely overvalued to do so, and despite the ethics of doing so in these recent at-the-market deals. 50/ \n\nBy contrast, Mr. Buffett points out he\u2019d prefer new and current shareholders to have a fair experience in his company\u2019s shares. If the auto makers won\u2019t take them in a deal, and they shouldn\u2019t, then that leaves new shareholders to provide growth capital. Hello passive crowd. 51/ \n\nWe\u2019ll see what happens after Monday, when Tesla assumes the #6 perch in the index. When the argument for passive is low fees, remind me in ten years how much of the loss in Tesla\u2019s shares from here should be considered a \u201cfee,\u201d or a tax on stupidity. 52/ \n\nAt 1.75% of the index, a decline of 80-90% would be heavy, but realistic. Impossible to decline that much? An 88% drop takes you all the way back to\u2026.where Tesla\u2019s shares began the year. 53/ \n\nA 90% decline takes the cap to $66B, 2.2x current run rate revenues &amp; 37x a hypothetical 6% net margin. A mere 80% drop gets to a $132B cap, 4.4x revenues, and to give the bulls on Tesla not being a car company credit, still 37x a 12% hypothetical profit margin. Ridiculous. 54/ \n\nYou can play around all you like w/ assumptions for growth, market share, expansion into new markets, profit &amp; returns on capital, but paying for some fractional ownership of today\u2019s $760B fully diluted market value is highly likely to produce a disastrous investment result. 55/ \n\nBravo, S&amp;P. The decision to add $TSLA at present valuation is almost sure to exact pain on passive investors, compelled to \u201cinvest\u201d 1.75% of capital in one of the most overvalued companies on record. Brilliant. As the other Buffett sings, \u201cCome Monday, it\u2019ll be all right...\u201d 56/ \n\nAs disclosure, I have a small short position in $TSLA. Don\u2019t take this note as investment advice because it\u2019s not. Do your own research. Stocks go up &amp; down, and shorting is extremely dangerous. Upside is capped and downside is unlimited. $TSLA has risen 8.3x just this year. 57/ \n\nIf Tesla repeats the same return over the next year the market cap would be $6.3 trillion. Two years of repeat performance and the cap becomes $52 trillion. Of course, that\u2019s 70% larger than the entire S&amp;P 500, but by then any short seller is long bankrupt. 58/58 END",

        "selftext": "**Should you buy Apple stock or has the company run out of growth opportunities? What is my price prediction for Apple in the next years? Read until the end as I reveal my price target for Apple and also what I think will happen in the next couple of days, weeks &amp; months!**\n\n**\\~ Warning! Very Very Long Post\\~**\n\nHello everyone! So, let\u2019s go over some of the latest news on Apple before moving on to some fundamental and technical analysis, predictions and my price target for the stock in the next years.\n\nSo, let\u2019s start with the [news](https://postimg.cc/Xrkwk6rP) that Apple will cut the App Store commission in half for small app developers starting in the next days, this will affect developers who earn less than $1M annually from the App Store Sales. This is likely to lead to a small decline in commission revenues for Apple as around 98% of the app developers will qualify for this tax reduction from 30% to 15%, but all these small developers only contribute to about 5% of the estimated $50B in annual revenues from the App Store, so that would be only a $1.25B loss for the company, that is less than half a % of the company\u2019s total net sales in the last fiscal year.\n\nAlso, these changes may lead to a potential long-term revenue boost, as it is likely this will lead to an increasing creation of apps which will generate more commissions in return.\n\nAlongside this we also saw the company releasing the new MacBook\u2019s with their first in-house [chip](https://postimg.cc/vc39NF7x), which promises faster video and imaging processing [times](https://postimg.cc/CR5Fmj5V), with both [CPU](https://postimg.cc/Y4yLdrMd) and [GPU](https://postimg.cc/xJz8gLsd) performance up to 2 times faster than the latest PC laptop chip using just a fraction of the power consumption, with both of the macbooks promising big improvements in [battery](https://postimg.cc/1fp6y1rz) life. Apple is also [expected](https://postimg.cc/GHrtJ8vc) to roll out even more in-house chips in future products, as they have started the 2-year breakup with Intel chips.\n\nWe also saw Morgan Stanley [upgrading](https://postimg.cc/bZ5qMsSS) their base case to $191 at the end of November, as they have cited record lead times, supply chain forecasts and carriers demand as they expect that the company will sell around 270M iPhone in fiscal year 2021, that\u2019s 50M more than the consensus and almost 30M more than the previous estimate of Morgan Stanley, with an average selling price of 842$, 9% more than the base case, as people tend to chose the more expensive and high tech versions of the lineup in this new 5G cycle.\n\nThe 5G super-cycle, which I believe is on the way, and will continue in the next years, as 5G become more available worldwide, could still be the biggest thing coming right away for the company with 5G smartphones [expected](https://postimg.cc/LJptP88f) to surpass 4G sales by 2024, with the average sale price of the 5G phones also coming down, helping them become more popular. This will also be helped by the recent entry to the Indian [market](https://postimg.cc/7fV6BHNS), as India will probably become the world biggest country in the next decade, this could be a huge opportunity for Apple to start and take away market-share from their competitors like Samsung and Xiaomi which have the biggest market shares right now.\n\nThey also [released](https://postimg.cc/PpWhPy31) an update iPad Pro and an all-new iPad Air in September which will also boost sales in this work-from-home environment that will keep the demand very high for this kind of products, just like the Macs. Alongside the increasing demand from the Wearables, Home &amp; Accessories that include Air Pods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, and many more products.\n\nBut the biggest reasons I believe Apple is poised for continued growth, is primarily due to its services business, as they start to offer more and more services like the Apple ONE [BUNDLE](https://postimg.cc/4777MD3s), which include up to 6 services from (Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, the new Apple Fitness+ and the iCloud service) for a pretty reasonable price in my opinion [starting](https://postimg.cc/BLkDnqzj) from 15$ up to 30$/month, this could be a great option for families and even individuals who use their services a lot.\n\nThe latest services, [Fitness+](https://postimg.cc/cKV4KrsG) just launched in the past days, and is a direct competitor to the likes of Peloton, as the service is available on the iPhone, iPad or even Apple TV. This also makes consumers buy the Apple Watch which syncs to the other devices to show you different information. The Fitness+ app just on its own is 8$/month or 80$/year which is less expensive than Peloton subscription which charges 13$ or even traditional gyms like Planet Fitness at 10$/month.\n\nI think this will be the fastest growing sector for the company, as this aligns with the new macro trends, as the world is moving more and more to a digital approach to almost everything as consumer preferences, with more &amp; more younger people reaching the point in life when they use these services start to align to this increasing digital approach.\n\nWe also shouldn\u2019t forget the Apple Card &amp; Apple Pay service among many others which also seem to gain from the move to digital &amp; contactless payments, as this has been accelerated due to the current situation in the past year.\n\nAnd one last piece of [news](https://postimg.cc/k6BKCVTr), and the most recent one, is that Apple may have fast-tracked the Titan project. The Titan project is targeting a 2024 or 2025 push to develop an electric vehicle with advanced battery technologies, that will deliver significant increases in range at much lower costs than the current technologies while also offering self-driving capabilities.\n\nIt\u2019s reported they will not use the same technology as Tesla Full-Self-Driving feature, but will use LIDAR sensors, similar to those that we can find in the latest iPhone 12 PRO.\n\nI think Apple can go 2 ways with this project, they can either use the huge amount of cash the company has to buy another car-maker like Ford, GM or any other car manufacturer expect Tesla and Toyota which do have a big market cap, so that they can fast-track the potential manufacturing of cars, or they can enter into a partnership with big companies like Tesla, Volkswagen or any other car marker to either produce cars or license their technology to this other car-makers which would ultimately and probably have higher margin-returns than the effective manufacturing of cars. Apple\u2019s current overall [gross margins](https://postimg.cc/ykv1mfVP) stand at 38% vs the 15% average of the world top 10 automakers by market cap, which is significantly lower.\n\nBut this Apple Car thing is so far out, and there are so many unknowns, I will not try to predict anything related to this until there is more clarity on the subject.\n\nAnd last, before moving on to some predictions, here are some of the highlights that we heard from the latest investors conference meeting, as the CEO, Tim Cook [expressed](https://postimg.cc/TyhpLzgg) optimism ahead with the launch of many new products and services, especially the Home Pod Mini and the new 5G iPhones, as these new iPhones include new LIDAR scanners that greatly improve the camera capabilities, as the iPhone as seen very positive reviews. We also saw the Senior VP and CFO, Luca Maestri give us great [outlook](https://postimg.cc/DWDmqxPD) for the company as they expect the installed devices base to continue to growth despite already being at an all-time high as they have over 585M paid subscriptions on their platforms and expect this to surpass 600M by the end of 2020.\n\nI also researched and found what products we can see in the near future, with the first half of [2021](https://postimg.cc/jCBQsXVM) bringing new iMacs, the AirPods3 and the iPad Pro, while in the [FALL](https://postimg.cc/8jVJKngg) event we will probably get the new iPhone 13 alongside the iPhone SE PLUS and the Watch Series 7 with more products coming [later](https://postimg.cc/GHc3s01t) in 2021 or that don\u2019t have an estimated release date like the Air Pods Pro, the Air Tags and the iPad Mini 6.\n\nSo, before even starting, you should now that I am bull on Apple but I am willing to hear other opinions so don\u2019t be afraid to leave a comment down below.\n\nI have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the [company](https://postimg.cc/JHRDpPGQ), the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research.\n\nThis are my 2025 projections for Apple, let\u2019s take a closer look at them, each on their own.\n\nSo, in term of revenues, Apple has 5 big sources of income, which saw an overall increase of 6% despite lagging sales in the iPhone. The biggest revenue is by far the iPhone right now with over $137B in revenue in the fiscal year ending in September. I expect to see the iPhone sales increasing in the next years, especially in 2021, with the new 5G iPhone creating a super-cycle for the [company](https://postimg.cc/XGfBKT7J), as most iPhone users, including myself here, as I will upgrade from my iPhone X, will switch to this new product. The iPhone sales have decreased in the last couple of years by 14% and 3% as a result of the product not having big improvements, as well as iPhone usually starting to last longer than previous models, so I expect to see a 12% increase in sales next year and a gradual decrease in the growth of sales as more people upgrade, ending with just a 5% growth in iPhone [sales](https://postimg.cc/V0wfRpr7) in 2025.\n\nThe next revenues stream is from the Mac, which has seen an increase in the past 2years, with revenues topping $28B this year after the huge demand from the work from home consumers. I [expect](https://postimg.cc/1405tm2b) this trend to continue as they plan to continue to launch better products and I can see the company having a similar growth next year before starting to decline slightly until 2025, also ending with a 5% growth.\n\nThe iPad is currently the smallest revenue stream for Apple but has also seen an increase in demand in the past 2 years with a 13% average increase in revenues. I also expect the iPad to continue to grow in the next couple of years, especially with the learn-from-home environment for kids, and even after this period ends, the transformation for learning will implicate more digital usage. I [expect](https://postimg.cc/5XKtVsT0) the iPad to see some similar growth to the Macs, especially with the latest generation also bringing a new iPad air to the market.\n\nThe 4th revenue stream and the fastest growing in the past 2 years, with an average growth of 33% are the wearables, home &amp; accessories revenues. This have topped $30B this year, as Apple has also just launched the Apple Watch series 6 and also feature other great products like Apple TV, the Air Pods the Home Pod and the Home Pod mini alongside other third-party accessories.\n\nI gave this [revenue](https://postimg.cc/v4C4JQ4T) stream a growth of 20% starting next year with a gradual decrease to around 8% by 2025, as I believe this will become more &amp; more popular as they start to offer more vertical integration.\n\nAnd last, but by no means least, the revenue stream that I expect to grow the most and the fastest is the revenue from the services that Apple offers. This includes revenues from Apple Care, Advertising, Cloud Services, Payment Services like Apple Card &amp; Apple Pay and of course the digital content which includes fees from the App Store alongside subscription-based income including the new Apple One Bundle and Apple Fitness+ alongside the already know Apple Arcade, Apple Music, Apple News+, Apple TV+ and hopefully I don\u2019t forget any others.\n\nSo, I [expect](https://postimg.cc/svV7mDWR) this to become the clear 2nd biggest revenue stream for Apple by 2025, as I expect this to grow more than 20% next year, mainly due to the Apple One Bundle and Apple Fitness+ followed up by a slightly decreasing growth, ending with a 10% increase in revenues in 2025.\n\nI think this are fairly conservative base case scenarios for the revenues, as I expect them to continue to increase the [other](https://postimg.cc/1VFFgkxJ) revenue streams and not have such a large percentage of the revenues coming from the iPhone sales as you can see in this chart.\n\nIn terms of expenses, I pretty much kept the same margins as in previous years, with a 68% expense ratio on product sales \\[ [iPhone](https://postimg.cc/JDZ7jMnD) / [iPad](https://postimg.cc/Wd14CB9C) / [Mac](https://postimg.cc/q6GkZw2p) / [WHA](https://postimg.cc/211q9q8g) \\] and 35% expense ratio on [SERVICES](https://postimg.cc/8sdLLrjH), as this are way more lucrative.\n\nIn the past 3 years, the products [gross margin](https://postimg.cc/ykv1mfVP) was 32.7%, so I actually imply bigger expenses for the manufacturing and sales of products, as this is mostly impacted by the company\u2019s supplier\u2019s ability to make up for and demand, while for the services revenue, the gross margins for the last 3 years has been 63.5% on average, but I expect this to be more in-line with the 66% margin in this past year. So, if services manage to grow to about half the revenues from the iPhone, this will effectively double the gross revenues, as every buck gained in the service revenues account for 2$ in the product sales.\n\nSo, I expect the total [revenues](https://postimg.cc/sMjByQ2n) for Apple to increase from $274B in 2020 to over $440B by 2025, increasing by approximately 10%/year, while I will keep the expense ratio pretty much in-line and have them increasing by 11%/year, this would bring the total gross income for Apple to $177B, increasing mainly due to the services revenues as I said earlier. This growth is just above the 4year [average](https://postimg.cc/Tp8g83mS), and below the 2018 levels, which we might see again with this 5G super-cycle and explosive growth in the services revenue.\n\nI also think the company will continue to invest in both Capital Expenditure and Operating expenses.\n\nI think the operating expenses will remain pretty much in line with the [previous](https://postimg.cc/2qBCfrnc) years, as this number has increased by 1% [annually](https://postimg.cc/Fd5JL9v8) both in R&amp;D and SG&amp;A. So, I will keep the exact percentages from previous years, as I expect the revenue to increase, thus I don\u2019t see a big increase percentage wise. This would account for over $60B in operating expenses by 2025 and over $11B in Capital Expenditures by 2025, as I expect this to increase, mainly due to the possible EV developments or investments in self-driving capabilities alongside other manufacturing capabilities. You can see that the Capex [spending](https://postimg.cc/yDsRdpLy) has been decreasing in the past years with just over $8.8B in payments for business acquisitions and the other traditional Capex spending. Some people may use the cash generated by [investing](https://postimg.cc/Mn9nG6Mz) activities as Capex, but that is more unreliable. I also can see the Capex going back up, so I wanted to be safe and implied a 10% growth.\n\nThis money would account for over $73B in [expenses](https://postimg.cc/dZnY91K1) and would bring the profit for the company to almost $104B before interest and taxes.\n\nMoving on, let\u2019s see what interest income and expenses the [company](https://postimg.cc/cgy0x2ms) has had in the past few years. We can see a decrease in interest expense in the past few years as the company has been paying off debt, but they have also been generating less money in this department, with an overall decrease in this department of more than 50% in the past year, way less than the amount from 2018. So, for safety reasons, I used a 10% decline in both income and expenses [related](https://postimg.cc/QKgtZhZG) to interest, while increasing the other losses by 10%/year.\n\nThis would bring the company pre-tax income to just over $104B in 2025.\n\nLet\u2019s move on to taxes. I know the Federal income tax rate is 21% for the [company](https://postimg.cc/ykY39pq1), but the actual effective tax rate for the company was lower than 15% in the past year, mainly due to lower tax-rates on foreign earnings alongside tax-benefits and tax-settlements. The average effective tax rate has been just over 16% in the past 3 years, but with more and more of the revenues coming from outside the US, I think it\u2019s safe to say that the company will have around a 15% effective tax rate by 2025, this obviously if nothing major changes in tax policy around the world.\n\nSo, Apple would [have](https://postimg.cc/Wqc3ytKw) $88.6B in income after tax by 2025 and with the current outstanding shares standing at just under 17B, so I don\u2019t even account for the company probably continuing to do share buybacks, this would mean a $5.22 [future](https://postimg.cc/4YytCLwL) earnings/share. And with today\u2019s price for Apple just around 136$, that would mean to [company](https://postimg.cc/RNf1qH44) is trading at just over 26 times forward price to earnings.\n\nI don\u2019t think Apple will ever trade at a discount again, with the current PE [standing](https://postimg.cc/RqwqHQ6s) at over 40, I believe this will eventually go down, probably to around 35, despite the increase in services revenue, which is highly valued by investors. I think we can see Apple trade somewhere near 35 [times](https://postimg.cc/5H98PKv2) P/E in 2025, especially if something big happens with the EV project, this could be even higher, just look at Tesla which trades at [insane](https://postimg.cc/sBZhxMk5) P/E. Of course, we also have to take into consideration the dividends that will be received from owning the stock, as Apple has started to pay dividends almost a decade ago and has 9 years of dividend growth, with a 10% annual rate of [growth](https://postimg.cc/CnbZMbD2) in the past 5 years. [Here](https://postimg.cc/7CLT1G8C) is the dividend growth history for the company, as I also went conservative on this [estimate](https://postimg.cc/Tp7LcjGr) and implied a 7% growth for the next 2 years, 6% for 2023 and 2024 and just 5% in 2025.\n\nSo [here](https://postimg.cc/R3PK21QQ) are my 3 price targets for the company, [including](https://postimg.cc/JHR8JXvv) dividends but not reinvested. My bear case scenario is that Apple will trade at almost 165$ which implies a [return](https://postimg.cc/jCYzWhd2) of over 21% by 2025, while my base case scenario would see Apple trading at 195$ with a return of capital of 43%. I will also make the bull case for Apple trading at 225$ by 2025 with dividends included, which would imply just over 65% in gains by then.\n\nI think this is possible as Apple has also [continued](https://postimg.cc/fJj36jMt) to buy back shares of the company on a constant basis, as they continue to an impressive campaign with over $72B worth of common stock repurchased in 2020. They continue to buy back shares at a very fast pace, having repurchased over 1.3M shares in 2019 and 2018, while also issuing less stock every year.\n\nSo here is the full [spreadsheet](https://postimg.cc/Z995KrzL) that I have projected for Apple by 2025 and the breakdown of everything i estimated \\[ [1](https://postimg.cc/jCT7qdZJ) / [2](https://postimg.cc/DmcbSkMp) \\] , if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.\n\nKeep in mind, these targets might sound ridiculous, but just [look](https://postimg.cc/V50nHCSn) at the growth Apple has had in the last 5years. The company has increased in value by more 400% in just the past 5years and is over 100.000% up since it started trading. So yes, the valuation is mad right now for the company. So, are you willing to bet against Apple?\n\nThe company also has pristine [financials](https://postimg.cc/LYcYMxqf), with more than $65B in total assets compared to total liabilities, and more than $38B in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nSo, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for Apple?\n\nLet\u2019s look at this [CHART](https://postimg.cc/7592T1c8), so starting with the stock split, Apple saw a correction within the September stock market pullback, in a buy the news &amp; sell the event, after a huge runup post-announcement of the stock split. The stock entered a consolidation period, and didn\u2019t have any big catalysts, especially with new iPhone lineup not being included in the Q4 results due to the late launch. The stock found some levels of resistance near the $120 levels that it struggled to get past but acted also as support after breaking them just before the recent news of the possible EV developments or self-driving-features to be licensed to other car manufacturers. After that news the stock spiked and has now reached the previous highs made before the stock split and is facing some resistance, if the stock pushes over $140 I think we can officially say that it broke the resistance at those levels and is not just a fake-out. But I think it\u2019s likely that the stock will consolidate between 122 and 135$ in the next weeks until the next iPhone sales and quarterly results are released, as the stock has entered overbought territory again with an RSI over 70, the first time since the stock split.\n\nSo, what would I do? Well, I own Apple stock, and I really believe this company will remain the biggest or one of the biggest in the future, so I would really add on any weakness that the stock shows before the next quarter earnings are released, as typically Q1 [earnings](https://postimg.cc/V5t0FPTF) are the best for the company due to increased holiday sales combined with the launch of new products. I think any entry below 130$ would be really nice to start and build a position or increase it if you already own the stock. As I believe Apple is one of the most stable stocks out there with large institutional [holders](https://postimg.cc/3kqG3XcK) like Vanguard, BlackRock and Berkshire owning over 900M shares each.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "Gather round you hopeless autists. We have to talk. Listen to me you hopeless stupid fucking retards.  \nThe only reason I am not posting this on r/investing is because you asstards need help. There is some  \nserious chicken fucking tendies to be made here.  \nI'm the guy who famously claimed that Bob Swan, Intel CEO, should fabricate a silicone butt and fuck it  \nduring Intel's next earning call to appease stock holders instead of going over their financials. (See: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j6ioot/intel\\_is\\_fucked/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j6ioot/intel_is_fucked/)) As it turns out, I was right and Bob Swan showed everyone how much of a dipshit he really is and how he literally knows nothing about this industry. I doubled my principal on my last Intel put and I plan to do the same with my next more here.  \nFirst, let us a take a good look at what happened to intel. There is so much wrong with that company and I talked about it a lot in my last post. This analyst, Stacy Rasgon, who actually seems to have a basic understanding of this shit, sums it up fairly well. Click the fucking link asshole. Listen to him.  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzTg6vWgDhQ  \nSo what do we have here:  \n  \"If you start digging in, theres almost no good news here. Gross margins have collapsed.\"  \n  \"This is the beginning of the bear thesis which seems to be embedded in the numbers here.\"  \n  \"Current trajectory of the business does not look good.\"  \nJesus Christ. Should have gone with the silicone butt bobby. Intel is ACTUALLY on fire. So what the fuck does intel plan to do about it? Bob Swan said himself on the earnings call that he wants to go with TSMC. Interesting choice Bobby Boy. Interesting because for once this is not a bad decision. But WHY would Bob Swan want to go with TSMC?  \nTSMC is perhaps the most strategically important company in the world right now. The American government has dramatically increased military operations with Taiwan.   \nOne very critical point that the average wsb idiot misses is that TSMC is only a foundry. Because of this they can focus only on improving their chip-manufacturing and not have to worry at all about selling/marketing the chips. Some of the major customers of TSMC are \\[3\\]:  \n\n\n* AMD\n* Apple (25% of TSMC revenue)\n* Broadcom\n* Marvell\n* MediaTek\n* Nvidia\n* Qualcomm\n* Xilinx\n\nSoon intel as well. Simply put, if any one of those companies above do well then TSMC wins. Their financials are perfect, they are the world leaders in their covid-proof industry, the only fab with a 5nm process and have a ton of massive customers for whom they have great relationships with (they built and bankrolled a new fabrication center just for Apple for fucks sake). If you pay close attention to this stuff, you may have heard how Nvidia recently went to Samsung for fabrication, yeah, Nvidia backtracked quickly on that and they are going back to TSMC due to Samsungs shit yields \\[4\\].\n\n  \n**Stop massaging your wife's boyfriend's vas deferens and listen up.** The American government  \nis currently preparing for a war with china over TSMC. The US is rapidly heading from a cold to a hot war with China. Some experts, such as Niall Furgeson, a well respected Stanford historian is already calling it \"Cold War 2\" \\[7\\].  \nThere is a video you must watch on this topic. It is produced by a Chinese-Hating-Korean-Trump-Supporter but it is most primary sources from China and it sums up quite well the China internal sentiment on this issue. (Click it you fucking autist):  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2uP\\_8YoJTU&amp;ab\\_channel=KoreanaJones  \nWell, shit. So here we are:\n\n* The US can no longer fabricate semiconductors, only Taiwan can.\n* America will do everything is can as a matter of national security to protect TSMC.\n* USA bans China's only serious semi conductor fabricator SMIC. \\[5\\]\n* USA bans anyone from doing business with Chinese tech firms like Huawei. TSMC even confirmed AGAIN they will not fabricate for Huawei. \\[6\\]\n* Taiwan HATES China so they don't actually even want to work with their shitty fake tech companies.\n* Semiconductors are critical to a modern economy/military. (Xi JinPing has said this himself.)\n* Taiwan's military is a joke compared to China's so they will do everything to appease the Americans  \n  for the survival of their nation.\n* Hong Kong proved to the world, especially Taiwan, that China has zero interest in honoring any governance agreements made. This raises the stakes for Taiwan dramatically as a cooperation with China means a complete erasure of their culture and history.\n* ASML, the people who make the machines for TSMC, are a German company. Unsurprisingly, Germany has taken a similar stance, including military aid, for Taiwan. ASML is a \"crown jewel\" for Germany and they make a shit ton supporting TSMC.\n\n  \nSo what is the bear case for a company that is at the heart of US/Taiwan/Germany/Europe national security interests? A company which is ACTUALLY technologically superior to their competition and is basically the only game in town?  \nThe bear case is potential war with China. But if that happens your positions are going to shit anyway.\n\n**Options (Wish I bought more):**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r9uchpxpd0561.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ba1bc3a98783399ddfe80637b527ceb032ec742\n\n  \n**Stocks:**\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/knuge7gsd0561.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b72bd468a5e77f97a423835eaaf2e87b6c1d8275\n\n**References**\n\n1.

        "selftext": "Brought to you by the retard who made $3 million by YOLOing into NVAX (peep the profile), here is my next play. I recently liquidated the majority of my NVAX shares and dumped the rest of my money into LAZR.\n\nFor those who don't know LAZR is a Peter Thiel backed company specializing in LiDAR technology for vehicles, that just underwent a SPAC merger. This caused the stock to skyrocket 300% within three weeks. The stock is still up 150% just this month even following this past week of consolidation and bad news.\n\nThe main reason that the stock was falling this past week, aside from consolidation was due to a hit piece by Shitron (Citron). If you are part of this community you know that Citron is utter market manipulating dogshit. It started to recover yesterday, until news came that Mobileye (an Intel subsidiary) would be producing its own in-house LiDAR technology. This caused the stock to fall another 20%.\n\nHowever, this was a complete market overreaction. The main reason for recovery today is that LAZR was given a price target of $41 by Northland's Gus Richard (a 5 star analyst, much more competent than the retards at Citron), as well as an upgrade from Market Preform (Hold) to Outperform (Buy). If every thing goes as planned, they will not have produced in house sensors by 2025. He stated that he doubts Intel would be able to successfully produce this in time.  Given Intel's terrible year with their chips, there should not be much confidence behind them.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-luminar-lazr-stock-because-163420247.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-luminar-lazr-stock-because-163420247.html)\n\n[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201216005495/en/Mobileye-and-Luminar-Drive-Collaboration-Full-Speed-Ahead](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201216005495/en/Mobileye-and-Luminar-Drive-Collaboration-Full-Speed-Ahead)\n\nLAZR still has several contracts with companies such as Volkswagen, Volvo and Daimler, and even NIO in China, with products releasing throughout 2021 and 2022. As time goes on, only more contracts will be acquired.\n\n[https://www.digitalbulletin.com/news/volkswagen-group-signs-self-driving-tech-deal-with-luminar](https://www.digitalbulletin.com/news/volkswagen-group-signs-self-driving-tech-deal-with-luminar)\n\n[https://www.media.volvocars.com/us/en-us/media/pressreleases/268323/next-generation-volvo-cars-to-be-powered-by-luminar-lidar-technology-for-safe-self-driving](https://www.media.volvocars.com/us/en-us/media/pressreleases/268323/next-generation-volvo-cars-to-be-powered-by-luminar-lidar-technology-for-safe-self-driving)\n\n[https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/Daimler-Trucks-and-Torc-partner-with-Luminar-to-enable-automated-trucking--Daimler-Trucks-acquires-minority-stake-in-Luminar.xhtml?oid=47961232](https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/Daimler-Trucks-and-Torc-partner-with-Luminar-to-enable-automated-trucking--Daimler-Trucks-acquires-minority-stake-in-Luminar.xhtml?oid=47961232)\n\nIf you are bullish on any of the Chinese electric vehicle stocks, you should be bullish on LiDAR as well as they are using this technology in their car. Even Elon Musk is afraid of this technology. The fact that he is denouncing this technology clearly indicates to me that it is a threat to him.\n\n[https://www.scmp.com/tech/innovation/article/3110694/chinese-tesla-rival-xpeng-will-add-lidar-their-self-driving](https://www.scmp.com/tech/innovation/article/3110694/chinese-tesla-rival-xpeng-will-add-lidar-their-self-driving)\n\n[https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/22/anyone-relying-on-lidar-is-doomed-elon-musk-says/](https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/22/anyone-relying-on-lidar-is-doomed-elon-musk-says/)\n\nWhy LAZR over VLDR?\n\nVLDR is the industry leader. However, it is clear that LAZR's sensors are much more powerful and cheaper to produce. The CEO literally invented a brand new microchip because the current ones in the market weren't good enough. Speaking of the CEO, he is a big dick 25 year old youngest new billionaire in the world. He was given 100,000 by Thiel to drop out of Stanford and pursue LAZR.Ignore this next part if you are not familiar with the technology, but for those who are, VLDR uses a LiDAR unit that stacks 64 lasers in a vertical column and spins the whole thing around many times per second. This is incredibly expensive to produce. LAZR instead uses a single mirror to focus and guide its lazer, making it significantly cheaper.\n\nTLDR: Buy LAZR. Backed by Peter Thiel, just recently given a price target of $41.",

If they live up to expectations, they will significantly outpace the performance of the latest machines running Intel chips, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the plans aren\u2019t yet public. Intel\u2019s shares slid 1.7% in early trading in New York Monday after the news. Apple shares were little changed.\n\nThe road map indicates Apple\u2019s confidence that it can differentiate its products on the strength of its own engineering and is taking decisive steps to design Intel components out of its devices. The next two lines of Apple chips are also planned to be more ambitious than some industry watchers expected for next year. The company said it expects to finish the transition away from Intel and to its own silicon in 2022.\n\nWhile Intel gets less than 10% of its revenue from furnishing Apple with Mac chips, the rest of its PC business is liable to face turbulence if the iPhone maker is able to deliver demonstrably better-performing computers. It could accelerate a shakeup in an industry that has long been dependent on Intel\u2019s pace of innovation. For Apple, the move sheds that dependency, deepens its distinction from the rest of the PC market and gives it a chance to add to its small, but growing share in PCs.",

So why is the stock tanking for the last 2 months? Because analysts are retarded and things have changed since the last reputable analyst call. Goldman downgraded the stock early december since they don't see how it can continue to grow. Since then, we have had $600 in direct payments AND we might get another $2,000. Last stimulus, majority of it went to durable goods aka electronics. The government wants to straight up give you money to buy PS5 AND Xbox with a 65\" TV to go along with it. Good thing BBY sells all of these AND they are preferred for electronics over any other retailers. \n\nBut analysts don't want you to know that.

AMD's value proposition for as a unified CPU and GPU manufacturer seems to have worked with last gen and current gen game consoles, as both Sony and Microsoft have opted for the same silicon. PC Users may also be attracted by the unified components value proposition and translate to higher PC CPU and GPU sales as AMD has filled the gap with both INTC and NVDA.\n\nDepending on how many GPUs AMD keeps in stock and the actual demand for new GPUs in 2021, I think the 6000 Series could chip away at NVDA's strong lead in market share for GPUs like with Intel CPUs. In doing so, this may attract investors away from NVDA, like with INTC, and boost AMD's stock significantly.\n\nIF (big if) AMD's next CPU/GPU line-up is to overtake NVDA next year, they could easily become the next $500B semi-conductor company in a few years. \n\nNow, what do the autists of WSB think?

        "selftext": "**Should you get into stocks that benefit from the booming housing market? Is the workout at home trade done? Intel stops the bleeding while Apple loses lawsuit. Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw all 3 big indexes closing the day in the red despite hitting intraday records, with the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/PCN8dwz) losing .38%, while both the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/cDjpNKP) and the [DOW JONES](https://ibb.co/RydQj61) Industrial finished the day down just over .2% as we also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/44wGzR0) rising by more than 4% yesterday as the $2000 stimulus was [BLOCKED](https://ibb.co/WFNSpCH) in the Senate by McConnell and the Georgia Senate runoff election is just a week away.\n\nAlmost 70% of the [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/LYM4JfL) were declining yesterday on below average volume as the number of companies that were trading above the 50-day moving average fell under 70% for the first time in quite a while.\n\nWe saw 9 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/GRJSmht) closing in the red yesterday, with only the Health Care and Consumer Discretionary sectors having small gains as almost all the types of companies were losing ground [YESTERDAY](https://ibb.co/7tKPyP4), especially the small-caps with the small-cap growth group losing more than 2%.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/KjVsn9X) from yesterday, it\u2019s mostly red, with only a couple of companies that were gaining big like the Chinese companies alongside Amazon and Intel.HEAT\n\nWe also got some economic data yesterday, as a review of the 2020 aviation and air travel [ESTIMATED](https://ibb.co/hRbYxpG) that traffic will be down 67% since last year, dropping to levels not seen since 1999, as air travel is still struggling to come back after the march bottoms. This has affected most of the [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/FBq4g37) worldwide but it seems that China airlines is doing somewhat better with the biggest percentage of the total number of flights completed compared to last year.\n\nThe SP Home price [INDICES](https://ibb.co/W67RBYh) also came in better than expected with the National Index increasing by 1.4% M/M, as this is a leading measure of real estate prices, gaining 8.4% nationwide over year ago. \n\nThese moves can also be seen in the latest Redfin report, as home sales [PRICES](https://ibb.co/CwR5H56) are up 14% year/year to over $320K with a great increase in pending [SALES](https://ibb.co/mJtrwV9) which are also up more than 34% since last year, as the number of active [LISTINGS](https://ibb.co/vVkfMMh) of home sales is down more than 30%, as buyers can\u2019t snatch them up quick enough with such low [YIELDS](https://ibb.co/7j1kY3s), as this has led for the [AVERAGE](https://ibb.co/gzQq8Wb) sale price to list value to rise to 99.4% which Is up 1.5% since 2019. This should be good news for companies like Toll Brothers, Lennar, HD and LOW.\n\nThis was also accompanied by the great numbers in the us chain store sales [NUMBERS](https://ibb.co/4PykPcH), which rose by almost 9% y/y with December sales expected to rise almost 5% since last year and a .2% increase since last month.\n\nWhile [TODAY](https://ibb.co/8N3YMPV) we start the day with MBA Mortgage applications, home sales and the Chicago PMI alongside advance reads on many other data points.\n\nIn some other stock market [NEWS](https://ibb.co/q1J6Snv), we saw Apple cool of a little yesterday, losing more than 1% for the day while they also lost a lawsuit aimed of stopping Corellium using virtual iPhone for security researching in the operating system, while [INTEL](https://ibb.co/3vvXFGT) finally got a breather and recovered some of the recent loses, after an activist hedge fund manager pushed for strategic changes in the company as Intel is losing market share and top designers, with the company also [ISSUING](https://ibb.co/WgtwTrY) a statement that lifted spirits around the stock.\n\nWe also saw the [FAA](https://ibb.co/6rJ6bHd) introduce new rules for drones, this may have a big impact on companies like UPS, Walmart and Amazon, as all of them have started trials for drone-delivery, as this could lead to better margins for the companies.\n\nThe Fed also [EXTENDED](https://ibb.co/cxV3HkC) the main street lending programs until Jan. 8 with the approval of Mnuchin as they try to process a bunch of applications this month, this means we can get even more money put into the economy and eventually the stock markets which is good news.\n\nAnd meanwhile, AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine was [APPROVED](https://ibb.co/y5QWbmh) for emergency use in the UK, this is another weapon to find this freaking illness, while JNJ will give us some results in early 2021 and Novavax just started their trial in the US.\n\nAlso, one last piece of data that I found recently shows that there was indeed a huge spike this [YEAR](https://ibb.co/JrKw01B) in the move to live streaming video and pre-recorded videos this year, as this has boosted companies like Peloton, Lululemon and others.\n\nBut this trend is seen slowing down in the next years with just a 4% [CAGR](https://ibb.co/HGhFJXS) in the equipment market, but that the exercise apps will see a big [GROWTH](https://ibb.co/02wm273) in the next years, so there are 2 different POV. I wouldn\u2019t stay invested in companies like PTON right now, I\u2019d rather take profits and move to other areas in the stock market. But don\u2019t rush into companies like AMC which have diluted their stock a lot or have lots of debt\u2026 this will not recover so fast, with [AMC](https://ibb.co/gDR8S81) filling to share up to 50M shares.\n\nLet\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/nbV49Bs) seem to be pointing at a good open, with all 3 big indexes in the green as the Nasdaq is leading the way.\n\nThank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content! Be sure to leave a comment down below with your opinion on the stock market!\n\nHave a great day and see you next time!",

They couldn't before because cheap Intel chips were too slow.\n* Many iPhone (50% market share in U.S.), iPad (65%), and Apple Watch (55%) users bought cheap Costco laptops. Apple can win these customers back with an affordable Macbook.\n* AAA gaming will come to Macs. The slowest Apple Silicon GPU is as fast as a 1050Ti. Soon, the median GPU in a Mac will be faster than the median gaming PC. Combined with a projected 50% market share, AAA game developers can't ignore Macs. Apple will take a cut of every AAA game sale because they will have to go through the App Store just like how they have to go through Steam on Windows.\n* By increasing their laptop/desktop share, Apple will sell more Apple One+ subscriptions because they're adding one more major device to the customer's ecosystem.\n\nApple is no longer a brand just for the wealthy. Apple is destroying the low mid-end market with SE products that are simply better than the competition. Apple is gunning for marketshare.

Having heard some of Russell\u2019s previous project musings I wrote [this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kdvw51/the_next_elon/) Now that I have done some more research (with the help of u/PokemonGoer94) I wanted to get a detailed analysis written up for you all to ignore and downvote!\n\n# LiDAR and Future Market Share\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ztmi5ayc58661.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b1aaf5f9f0d51d577acf329bc463546537cfbc9\n\n**The global LiDAR market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 13.2% from 2019 to 2027 to reach USD 3.6 billion by 2027.**^(1) It can be hard to determine if this is an accurate projection as we have been living in a time period of exponential growth in various markets. The profitability of LAZR in this time period will also be determined by what percent of the LiDAR market they can secure for production. What we do know now is LAZR is producing proprietary LiDAR systems that outpace their competitors, and have a faster production timeline (2022 vs. Velodyne\u2019s 2025 target).\n\n&gt;*\u201cWe have one of the most insane moats of any company at this stage,\u201d Russell said. \u201cWe\u2019ve built out and pioneered core components ... building from the ground up. We have not used commodity parts. We have the largest patent portfolio in sensing systems, more than the top five other LiDAR R&amp;D efforts combined.\u201d* ^(2)\n\nYou can view Luminar\u2019s patents here: [**https://patents.google.com/?assignee=Luminar+Technologies**](https://patents.google.com/?assignee=Luminar+Technologies)\n\n# Competitors\n\n\u201cThe various competitors prevalent in the market are challenged to provide innovative offerings, which help consumers, address changing technologies, business practices, and security needs. A large number of notable players are based in Europe and are involved in offering advanced solutions for meeting the requirements across varied applications.\n\n&gt;*The current market environment is witnessing intense competition between the key players for achieving market domination via enhancement of quality and product differentiation, thereby enabling the growing market consolidation through strategic initiatives such as alliances, mergers, and acquisitions. Industry participants have entered into strategic partnerships with suppliers and distributors to strengthen their product portfolio and geographical presence.* ^(1)\n\nWe can see LAZR is a heavy hitter right off the bat. They\u2019ve been public for a year and a half and have already made several big moves in that time, the oldest being their transportation industry partners and more recently their deal with Mobileye. Their transition into public trading on Dec. 3rd showed the potential for this company as investors tripled the stock price.\n\n# Current deals\n\n* LiDAR production for Mobileye (a division of Intel)\n* LiDAR production for Volvo fully autonomous driving\n\n# Current speculation\n\nAfter Citron\u2019s hit job (fuck you Citron) analysts have upgraded LAZR for a **$41 price target**.

That is why it's not going up. Sell if you don't want to wait till Q4 earnings report in February.\n\nFind\n\n#HERE\n\nat the bottom of the thread and read the big words, if you want to know why the dip doesn't matter\n\n___\n\nI posted this before in [Daily Discussion before](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kir3c3/daily_discussion_thread_for_december_23_2020/ggt8hjc/), and now I shall expand on it too.\n\nI see lots of brothers crying over CRSR, so I am going to shine light on it.\n\n1. CRSR have no marketing team(for stocks btw), they literally do not give a singular fuck about how their stocks do since IPO because of the busy holiday season.\n\n1. It is a long hold, their current price is undervalued because no news are generated for the boomers/traders and you know they can't read anything tech related. Boomers don't care about what it does or what future it has, only whether it would make more money in the future.\n\n&gt;[And while Corsair has been losing money on all of these businesses over the last couple of years \u2014 a $13.7M loss in 2018 and an $8.4M loss in 2019 \u2014 it seems that COVID-19 has been good to Corsair. The company saw a $23.8M profit between January and June 2020 alone.](https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21398656/corsair-ipo-billion-dollar-revenue-profit-coronavirus-shelter)\n\nCovid recovered all their losses within 6 months, people are staying home and upgrading their stuff so they won't be working with a fucking windows XP computer or shitty laptop from home. 18% market share and 42% of gaming peripherals?\n\nOh it's ThE vErGe so it's not reputable???\n\n**Straight from their S1 filing**:\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1743759/000119312520227100/d507744ds1.htm\n\n&gt;Leverage our software platforms to sell more gear to existing customers. Our software platforms integrate and enhance our ecosystem of gaming and streaming gear, which drives customer loyalty and allows us to successfully sell additional gear to existing customers.\n\n&gt;Strengthen relationships with end-users by increasing direct-to-consumer sales. Through **our acquisitions of Origin and SCUF in 2019, we acquired two companies whose sales are primarily generated through direct-to-consumer channels.** While sales from this channel are a **relatively small contributor to our revenue today, we believe direct-to-consumer sales represent a significant avenue to drive growth by facilitating increased market penetration across our product categories**.\n\n&gt;Continue to grow market share globally. As a globally recognized brand, we have a footprint that reaches customers in more than 75 countries. We will continue to invest in enhancing our sales and distribution infrastructure to expand our leadership position in the Americas and Europe. **In the gaming peripherals market, we have increased our U.S. market share from 5.0% in December 2013 to 18.3% in June 2020 on a trailing twelve month basis according to NPD Group.** We are a **clear market leader in the gaming PC components market.** According to NPD Group, we have **increased our U.S. market share from 26.2% in December 2015 to 41.9% in June 2020 on a trailing twelve month basis**. Additionally, **for the twelve months ended June 2020, we had number one U.S. market share in gaming computer cases with a 18% market share, cooling solutions with a 53% market share, PSUs with a 42% market share and high-performance memory with a 54% market share.** We view the **Asia Pacific region as a long-term growth opportunity and recently invested in our local sales force and regional management to build out distributor networks and retail partnerships.**\n\n&gt;Selectively pursue complementary acquisitions. We plan to evaluate, and may pursue acquisitions, such as our **acquisitions of Elgato, Origin and SCUF**, which we believe strengthen our capabilities in existing segments as well as diversify our product offerings, broaden our end-user base or expand our geographic presence.\n\nCorsair does PC components(PSU, RAM, PC Case, fans, etc) and peripherals(Keyboards, mouse, headphones, etc). If you missed out on CPU(AMD, Intel) or GPU(Nvidia), this is it. Only competitors listed in NYSE/NASDAQ are Micron and IBM(Random-access memory (RAM) modules market competitors), and their company directions are very different. Rest of Corsair's direct competitors are mostly concentrated in foreign markets(Logitech, Asus, Razer, Samsung(RAM), Gigabyte, Fujitsu, Toshiba, etc) or private(Kingston, G.Skill, EVGA, Steelseries etc).\n\nIf you want to sell it, go ahead. I am not here to sell you a stock that will fly to the moon tomorrow. This is a long haul stock that's not for short term holders, this is for the people that recognise and understand the following:\n\n#HERE\n\n#Net revenue was -&gt;$457.1 million&lt;-, an increase of 60.7% year-over-year.\n\n#Gamer and creator peripherals segment net revenue was $161.6 million, an increase of 128.8% year-over-year.\n\n#Gaming components and systems segment net revenue was $295.5 million, an increase of 38.3% year-over-year.\n\n#Recovered 2 years loss within 6 months of covid\n\n#As of September 30, 2020, cash and restricted cash of $120.1 million, $48.0 million capacity under our revolving credit facility and total long-term debt of -&gt;$370.1 million&lt;-.\n\n#That y-o-y growth with just 3B market cap\n\nStats from Q3 earnings report: https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/10/2123626/0/en/Corsair-Gaming-Reports-Third-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results.html\n\n**SO SHOULD I SELL????**\n\nThe stock is not GME(big daddy Cohen coming in to make it the ecommerce giant of gaming world), but they are pretty obviously undervalued. You should choose to at least hold it till Q4 earnings report in February which would include Christmas and holiday sales, that is also what people with GME, NVDA, AMD, AAPL and INTL wants to see. Q4 is where the money is always at for tech stocks thanks to Santa, especially so for CRSR who sees the largest sales number per annum on ecommerce site like Amazon during holiday season.\n\nBut yeah you can still choose to sell\n\nSo I can buy more.\n\nThanks and love you all retards, wishing all you GME \ud83d\ude80 diamond hands send the shorters to homeless shelters.",

        "selftext": "Key points:\n\n \n\n* **Luminar CEO and co-founder Austin Russell is poised to become a billionaire at 25 when his autonomous driving technology company Luminar goes public on Thursday.**\n* **The lidar sensing technology company works with major automakers as well as Intel\u2019s Mobileye.**\n* **Elon Musk says lidar is not needed for self-driving, but Luminar has a $1 billion-plus book of business and relationships with major automakers.**\n\n \n\n[Tesl](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=TSLA)a isn\u2019t the only upstart auto industry player having a big year.\n\nLuminar, which creates lidar technology critical to many automakers\u2019 autonomous driving efforts, is going public on Thursday through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) and the deal will make Luminar co-founder and CEO Austin Russell a billionaire \u2014 at the age of 25.\n\nRussell, who founded the company as a 17-year-old high school student, said the feeling of becoming a billionaire (on paper, at least) is \u201cabsolutely incredible\u201d and \u201ctotally surreal.\u201d\n\nBut the Luminar CEO said it also follows the plan his company has had in mind since founding. \u201cIt is totally surreal and it totally makes sense and it is hard to explain the dichotomy of it, but this has always been the goal,\u201d he said. \u201cWe set up the company to be a long-term sustainable business and power the future of autonomy for all of these automakers. We are in it for the long-term,\u201d Russell told CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box\u201d on Thursday morning.\n\n Russell was a bit of a science prodigy.\n\n\u201cI guess, I did memorize the periodic table \u2014 I think I was around 2 or so,\u201d [Russell told\u00a0CNBC Make It](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/09/thiel-fellow-austin-russell-founded-self-driving-car-tech-co-luminar.html) in a 2018 interview. \u201cI was just obsessed with learning certain things ... just independently learning and understanding a lot of new types of scientific fields, among other things.\u201d\n\nThat evolved into work on lasers and ultimately, lidar, which uses lasers to detect and measure distance and ultimately create a 3D map of the real world environment that can be used in self-driving.\n\nHe ended up at Stanford University studying physics, but dropped out and received a Thiel Fellowship, created by tech icon and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel to provide tech talent with alternatives to traditional education programs.\n\nRussell said the company has a forward looking book of auto business at $1.3 billion and estimates its overall market opportunity within the multi-trillion auto market at \u201chalf a trillion\u201d as lidar and autonomous vehicles come into focus for the auto industry.\n\nLuminar works with automakers including Volvo, which is owned by Chinese auto company Geely.\n\nWhile Russell said it can be hard for the market to value new technologies that lack existing market comps, he noted Luminar is working with [Intel](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=INTC)\u2019s Mobileye, which also focused on [the future of autonomous sensing systems](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/09/intels-self-driving-leader-on-the-race-against-tesla-uber-and-lyft.html). \u201cIt\u2019s cool to see back in 2017 they were acquired at a 43x revenue multiple of the business.\u201d\n\nLuminar, which made the 2018 [CNBC Disruptor 50](https://www.cnbc.com/cnbc-disruptors/) list, began trading under the ticker symbol [LAZR on the Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/lazr) on Thursday, after its deal with SPAC [Gores Metropoulos](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=LAZR) was completed.\n\n## Elon Musk\u2019s doubts about lidar\n\nThe Luminar CEO is not worried about lidar technology his firm has built become commoditized IP, saying the rise of this breakthrough technology is closer to what chip maker Nvidia does than a tech hardware company. \u201cWe have one of the most insane moats of any company at this stage,\u201d Russell said. \u201cWe\u2019ve built out and pioneered core components ... building from the ground up. We have not used commodity parts. We have the largest patent portfolio in sensing systems, more than the top five other lidar R&amp;D efforts combined.\u201d\n\nCompeting lidar technologies include firms such as [Velodyne](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=VLDRW) and [Alphabet](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=GOOGL)\u2019s Waymo.\n\nThere is one notable doubter.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has said that [lidar is not needed for autonomous driving](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/23/autonomous-vehicle-pioneer-doubles-down-on-technology-trashed-by-musk.html) to work. \u201cFreaking stupid,\u201d were Musk\u2019s words. The world\u2019s newest billionaire, Russell, disagrees.\n\n\u201cI think 50 commercial partners and a majority of the major automakers we are working with would disagree. Cameras and other systems are great for assisted driving, but with autonomy, that\u2019s where need really high-performance lidar,\u201d he said, adding that Luminar is the only company able to provide this technology at production and for use at highway speeds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/03/luminar-ipo-mints-a-25-year-old-autonomous-driving-billionaire.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/03/luminar-ipo-mints-a-25-year-old-autonomous-driving-billionaire.html)",

        "selftext": "So real old heads remember everyone's favorite meme stock from 2017. This bad boy was pulling in money left and right and was trading at a sexy P/E of under 14$. Micron Technologies was trading under 10 bucks before our man main entered the picture, Swag Master Sanjay Mehrotra in 2017 and ever since Micron Technologies has boomed to a beautiful 72$. So what is Micron technologies, and why is it going to make you rich:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What is Micron Technology?**\n\nThey're a company that specializes in producing NAND flash Semiconductors. Think the type of semi conductors used in your USBs, memory cards, cell phones and other small devices that lack the sizes for larger forms of dedicated storage. \n\n**What has been happening during the Rona**?:\n\nMicron crashed in February in anticipation of a decline of the global NAND market due to Corona's effects on the supply chain. However this disrupted China's ability to flood the market with semi-conductors and as a result allowed Micron to gobble up a huge amount of the market share. Another [WSBs DD post put it better than I could](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7emhl/micron_technology_mu_dd/). Go read his post as well to get a better idea of what''s been happening over the last few months with Micron:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The memory trough has finally bottomed. Micron did not lose money. How do I know it has bottomed? Earnings from other tech companies. They have been investing in data centers because the new hot technology is AI. Artificial intelligence require massive CPU, memory, and storage. Magnetic disk is so 1980\u2019s, it\u2019s all about NAND today. Who makes the hottest NAND? Intel and Micron collaborated on 3D XPoint (think Intel Optane). It\u2019s 1000x faster than NAND, last 1000X longer, and 10X as dense. It\u2019s basically not volatile DRAM, something to power the AI revolution.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Oh yeah, Micron just bought out Intel\u2019s share of 3DXPoint for 1.5B. The only manufacturing for 3DXPoint is in\u2026 Utah. That\u2019s right, not in China! So now I segue into the Mexican Beer virus. The majority of memory manufacturers are centered in the Wuhan area. The Wuhan area is basically shut down for the foreseeable future. Hmmm\u2026 which memory maker makes memory mostly outside China? If you said Micron, you win the prize. They have manufacturing locations in Idaho (you da hoe), Utah, Virginia, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Xian China. They have only one location in China, and it\u2019s not even in Wuhan.\n\nNot only did Micron use Corona as an opportunity to expand its market share, [but the dip in NAND memory demand was temporary and it returned to its upward trend](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/nand-flash-market-is-rebounding-faster-than-the-dram-market). Not only did demand increase; but the supply retracted as manufacturers in China and other Corona hit areas suspended operations as seen by this chart (you might have to click on it to see it closer)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Notice that oversupply is steadily declining](https://preview.redd.it/v8814125il361.png?width=328&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=820a650b6d82e238d8d9ffa53030961d59deeb68)\n\n**Diversification and Innovation**:\n\n[Here's an interview with the Swag Master himself:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLl3b7SMUBk) \n\nThey've been able to make big bucks diversifying into data centers which have boomed with work from home and they've been making money on the online schooling trend. The demand for enterprise PCs has gone up. More or less every product that Micron Technology sells has boomed as a result of corona virus and they were able to achieve an Earnings Per Share growth of +77.55% since last year. They also will likely be used for the AI for self-driving cars so that's going to be exciting. We might even see a huge boom from them in the mid term once they start making deals with large EV manufactures. \n\nNot only have they seen growth in these new product lines but they've also come up with a new chip that should put them ahead of the competition for at [least a few years](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/11/micron-technology-just-announced-an-important-tech/):\n\n&gt;*176-layer NAND flash:*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In the press release, Micron announced that it had begun volume shipments of the world's first 176-layer NAND flash chips. For those unfamiliar with NAND flash technology, it's becoming the nonvolatile storage medium of choice for many applications.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Nonvolatile storage retains information even when power is turned off. Legacy hard disk technology still has a place in cheap bulk storage in cloud data centers. Yet cost reductions have made NAND closer to hard disk drives in terms of cost-per-bit, and with much better performance and resilience, less space, and better total cost of ownership in many cases. NAND flash is found in data center servers, smartphones, game consoles, and laptops these days.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;With the data revolution taking off, NAND flash demand is supposed to compound at a 30% annual growth rate. Yet many NAND manufacturers have had a hard time making profits in recent years despite that insatiable end demand. Companies have begun stacking NAND modules on top of each other in a 3D vertical structure, with each layer significantly boosting storage capacity. While demand for bits has gone up, the NAND flash producers have oversupplied the market, crashing NAND prices along with profits.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;However, Micron's innovation could give it a significant leg up on rivals next year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why Micron Technology will grow after Covid**:\n\nThe big thing to realize is that Micron technologies has [some of the best chips in the market for handling the type of processing power that cell phones need](https://www.micron.com/insight/5g-ai-and-the-coming-mobile-revolution) for [5G and AI](https://www.micron.com/insight/5g-ai-and-the-coming-mobile-revolution). These guys are going to be miles ahead when 5G becomes the norm and the other companies will be trying to catch up for years. Don't take my word for it, trust everyone's favorite holocaust profiteers and Jeffery epstein's favorite bank, Deusche bank, who recently upgraded their outlook on them:\n\n&gt; In a research report, Ho said that Micron is expected to be a solid recovery pick as the economy starts recovering from the global pandemic. Demand drivers such as data centers, 5G smartphones, and gaming will accelerate the growth of Micron. Ho also pointed out that Micron is well-positioned for CY21 (calendar year 2021).   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Micron Technology is known as being a leading supplier and manufacturer of memory and storage used in a wide range of electronic devices ranging from PCs to smartphones. And the company is currently number three in market share for memory/storage shipments after Samsung and SK Hynix. DRAM currently makes up about two-thirds of the company\u2019s total revenue with NAND making up most of the rest of the revenue.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;DRAM is known for providing high-speed data storage and retrieval. And NAND flash products are electrically rewritable and nonvolatile memory that retains data when power is turned off. This makes NAND ideal for mass-storage uses \u2014 specifically for solid-state drives, which have started to displace traditional hard disk drives.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;DRAM and NAND are both promising for the future as SSDs are expected to be used in the majority of PCs and data centers as well as higher memory and storage content in smartphones. And AI and autonomous vehicles will also require substantial DRAM and NAND capacities.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Deutsche Bank is not the only brokerage to increase its price target on Micron. Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh recently increased the price target from $56 to $70. And Morningstar equity analyst Abhinav Davuluri, CFA recently increased the target price to $50 per share from $48. And in an analyst rating consensus of Micron stock with 33 ratings, 76% say buy, 21% say hold, and 3% say sell.\n\nThey aren't the only institution that's upgrading their outlook. It'd take too long to go over all of the upgrades so I'm just going to link them:\n\n[Goldman Sachs upgrades Micron Technologies](https://www.thestreet.com/streetlightning/stock-picks/mircon-computer-memory-dram-nand-technology-mu-semiconductor-goldman-sachs-buy)\n\n[Argus Research upgrades Micron Technologies](https://snapshot.fidelity.com/fidresearch/snapshot/landing.jhtml#/news?symbol=MU&amp;pageno=&amp;storyid=202012041056MIDNIGHTUSEQUITY_A2316094&amp;provider=MIDNIGHT&amp;product=USEQUITY&amp;sb=1&amp;sc=1&amp;san=1)\n\n[Morgan Stanley upgrades Micron Technologies](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3205255&amp;headline=MU-Micron-price-target-raised-to--from--at-Morgan-Stanley)\n\n[UBS Upgrades Micron Technologies](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/micron-shares-jump-after-ubs-boosts-rating-price-target)\n\n[Wells Fargo upgrades Micron Technologies](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3204494&amp;headline=MU-Micron-price-target-raised-to--from--at-Wells-Fargo)\n\nTheres probably more that I'm missing but you dont need me to post every [wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com)/Seeking Alpha/Motley Small Bus Rider word vomit from 2 bit prop traders and amatuer hedge fund larpers to prove my point. This bad boi is going up bigly.\n\n**The most important bit: How to trade**:\n\nYou guys can try making money with out of the money two week calls but I suspect that there are other ways to make money on this that might be more lucrative.\n\nFirst of all shares. Yes they are boring but keep in mind there's a really, really good chance that Micron gets the Vale treatment in the near future and spikes on rumors of being able to supply one of the big EVs with chips. I'm not going to tell you when this might happen because no one knows. But I feel it in my heart of hearts and half of the analysts upgrading it mention how Micron's new chip is going to have massive applications with self-driving automobile technology and if you watched some of the interviews with the Swag Master he always brings it up. Sure it might not be TSLA since they are in bed with TSM but keep in mind if they choose to keep that deal proprietary and TSM doesn't sell that chip to anyone else that means that basically there are no other chips for EV companies to choose from other than Micron.\n\nSecond what I'd really recommend are Leaps. Buy yourself some 2022 out of the money calls and you will print money in due time. There are just so many upside potentials with Micron that if even one of them ends up working out then these leaps will print.\n\nTLDR: Buy the 85$ January 2022 MU calls. You'll thank me later.",

A little bit of new DD perhaps, ja?\n\nIntel=big brain=$$$$$=**\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80** **\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80** **\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80**\n\n \n\n# Intel Advances Progress in Integrated Photonics for Data Centers\n\n **About the New Technology Building Blocks:** At the Intel Labs virtual event today, Intel demonstrated key progress in critical technology building blocks that are fundamental to the company\u2019s integrated photonics research. These technology building blocks \u2014 including light generation, amplification, detection, modulation, complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) interface circuits and package integration \u2014 are essential to achieve integrated photonics. A prototype shown at the event featured tight coupling of photonics and CMOS technologies, serving as a proof-of-concept of future full integration of optical photonics with core compute silicon. Intel also showcased micro-ring modulators that are 1000x smaller than traditional components. The large size and cost of conventional silicon modulators have been a barrier to bringing optical technology onto server packages, which require the integration of hundreds of these devices. These combined results pave the way for the extended use of silicon photonics beyond the upper layers of the network to inside the server and onto future server packages. \n\nIntel technology building blocks showcased:\n\n* **Micro-ring modulators:** Conventional silicon modulators take up too much area and are costly to place on IC packages. By developing micro-ring modulators, Intel has miniaturized the modulator by a factor of more than 1,000, thereby eliminating a key barrier to integrating silicon photonics onto a compute package.\n* **All-silicon photodetector:** For decades, the industry has believed silicon has virtually no light detection capability in the 1.3-1.6um wavelength range. Intel showcased research that proves otherwise. Lower cost is one of the main benefits of this breakthrough.\n* **Integrated semiconductor optical amplifier:** As the focus turns to reducing total power consumption, integrated semiconductor optical amplifiers are an indispensable technology, made possible with the same material used for the integrated laser.\n* **Integrated multi-wavelength lasers:** Using a technique called wavelength division multiplexing, separate wavelengths can be used from the same laser to convey more data in the same beam of light. This enables additional data to be transmitted over a single fiber, increasing bandwidth density.\n* **Integration:** By tightly integrating silicon photonics and CMOS silicon through advanced packaging techniques, we can gain three benefits: lower power, higher bandwidth and reduced pin count. Intel is the only company that has demonstrated integrated multi-wavelength lasers and semiconductor optical amplifiers, all-silicon photodetectors, and micro-ring modulators on a single technology platform tightly integrated with CMOS silicon. This research breakthrough paves the path for scaling integrated photonics.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIntel to the moon, ja?  **\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80** **\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80** **\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80**  \n\nPosition IBKR:  50 stonks (yes, we buy stonks here like big bois)",

        "selftext": "**TLDR: ALL-IN on corsair. Ride the wave.**\n\nCorsair is a consumer hardware company. They make money from PC components, Xbox and PS controllers and streaming components so your daughter could show off her mosquito bitten chest for the Chad's on twitch. They basically have monopolized the power supply market for the DIY gamers and is how they've built their brand. Their memory cards are also respectable in the field because memory doesn't compete the way AMD and INTC do for CPU performance. They also make fans, cases, headsets and mice for computers, all of which are starting to become very popular. They acquired SCUF Gaming so they have a foot in the console space, which is going to see the growth that will be off the charts in Q4 and FY2021 as the printer brrrrs and everyone stays home.\n\nMy DD will include two of the most important things you should seek: **Catalysts and Undervalued Fundamentals as well as analysts**\n\nAnd because no one seems to give a fuck about fundys these days, we'll start with\n\n**Catalysts:**\n\n**Generally Speaking:**\n\n* **Gaming is making your fatass, cant-run-a-lap-without-stopping, son cool in school. Look at all the stocks of gaming companies. Hard to find a loser.**\n* **Twitch has made it cool to build your own PC**\n* **25 day Quiet period expiration expires Monday**\n* **Economies of scale and catch-up effect (for my econ majors)**\n\n**Q2 2020:**\n\n* **Two high demanding FPS's** in Call of Duty and Valorant release\n* **WFH stipend** employees have been receiving for their WFH conversion; people bought herman millers and your wife's bf built her a new PC with corsair case, fans, PSU and memory cards\n\n**Q3 2020:**\n\n* **Nvidia's 3000 series released in September and sold out immediately.** The GPU is twice as efficient as the next best and for the same price. THIS literally makes people more willing to go big and build a new rig.\n* **Valorant** was released in June, so CRSR really starts benefitting in Q3\n* **Summer,** which means dad has to buy son the PC he built because that idiot got straight C's in school. I heard they hand out medals for every idiot who participates these days.\n* **WFH Stipend** again, as the unemployment rate falls, the amount of money new employees receive increases, incentivizing gamers to build a new PC to watch porn at 240hz ofc.\n* **Market realizes the growth in DIY computer builders because of Twitch and WoM marketing. DIY computer builders -- it has been a long time coming.** I built my first computer when I was 15, over 10 years ago. It's easy as lego's and you get more value out of each dollar spent. It is 100% the trend as well.\n\n**Q4 2020:**\n\n* **AMD** releases and **NVDA supply chain** improvement this quarter will make and have made a lot of people orgasm, more so than previous years. The rise of RH trading this year (increases exposure to the brand), all of which means more DIY nerds building PC's to finish the year\n* **XBOX release** this year 11/10 will be huge for SCUF gaming (WHOLLY OWNED subsidiary), which makes controllers for the new console. The company's ELITE controllers are sold out online. [https://scufgaming.com/xbox](https://scufgaming.com/xbox)\n   * SCUF PlayStation (11/12) controller has not been released yet for the new console\n* **Stimulus is finally coming** to all the broke boys, in a lump sum fashion ($5,200-7,800 federally), which means people will SPEND.\n\n**Q1 2021:**\n\n* Will be an **easy quarter** to compete against because the company has been experiencing income growth starting Q2 2020, not Q1.\n* **Stimulus payment effect**\n* If there's still **no vaccine** by now, holding CRSR will be a great hedge against the market bc as previously mentioned, WFH stipends, PC building and console gaming\n\n**Fundamentals, for my Buffet &amp; Munger enthusiasts:**\n\n**Literally cannot find a cheaper growth stock in the market.**\n\n* 72MM in free cash flow for the first 6 months 2020, with the latter half of the year historically being even stronger. The 6 months was carried by the strong Q2 2020\n* 58% YOY growth in sales in Q2 with 22.6MM in income\n* Q3 2020 will generate 50%+ sales growth, 35MM+ in income and 50MM+ in FCF (Conservative)\n* Q4 2020 will generate 50%+ sales growth, 75MM+ in income and 100MM IN FCF (Conservative)\n* 150MM in net income and 220MM+ in FCF Trailing Twelve Month by Q1 2021\n   * **I was the Math King in Kindergarten, so don't question my quantabilities.**\n* **1.7 Billion market cap**, implying 11x forward p/e and 8x future free cash flow on 50%+ s.g.\n   * Logitech is trading at a forward P/E of 20-25 and is worth 13.6 Billion\n   * Razer is worth 2.5 Billion and doesn't put up the kinds of numbers Corsair does.\n      * **PT estimate: $36-48, but could go to $60 with favorable peer and market conditions**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe sharp decline of the stock price was nothing more than profit taking.

        "selftext": "**The stimulus package is finally here. Tesla enters the SP500 while Nike posts blowout earnings. Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news**\n\n**\\~Very Long Post\\~**\n\nHello everyone and Good morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of Friday, as we saw all 3 big indexes finishing down for the day with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/vh3NzhK) losing more than 0.4% falling as lawmakers continued to [struggle](https://ibb.co/mcHVyNh) on the stimulus bill, but finishing half a percent up for the week, the SP500 losing 0.35% but rising by 1.4% for the week and the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/sCNjHGy) only down 0.07% while posting a huge 3% gain for the week. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/HpF7kz2) dropping again more than 1.6% on Friday and finishing almost 7.5% down for the [week](https://ibb.co/j3CzN3m).\n\nWe saw a massive day of trading on [Friday](https://ibb.co/72Q668L) with almost 80% of the companies trading above average volume, as it was quadruple witching day, and people had to move a lot of stocks to make room for the Tesla SP500 inclusion, but most companies lost ground despite this huge volume with the biggest losers being the Real estate and Energy sectors, losing around 1.7% for the day, while there were only a few [sectors](https://ibb.co/cwsj2b2) that had small gains with Materials leading the way in a late rally, as value plays suffered while growth companies were gaining on [Friday](https://ibb.co/gjvKvP8).\n\nHere is the HEAT MAP from [FRIDAY](https://ibb.co/5nhchr6), mostly RED as you can see, with INTEL losing more than 6% after the Microsoft [news](https://ibb.co/gM5F1kF), while Tesla spiked in the closing moments almost 6% after trading down in the last hours of the day.\n\nFor the week though, this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/y0tPpHR) shows that most companies were gaining significant ground, with the biggest companies in the world Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft being up significantly for the week, while Google which was hit by several outages and a couple of antitrust lawsuits was trading down. We also saw the Energy sector doing pretty bad for the week with most of the companies losing ground, while Tesla was the biggest gainer heading into the SP500 inclusion.\n\nWe also got some economic data, that showed the November leading [INDICATORS](https://ibb.co/Q6dkKVd) up 0.6% to 109.1, better than expected with manufacturing orders, residential construction permits and initial claims for unemployment insurance moving the number higher.\n\nWhile the Q3 account [deficit](https://ibb.co/4mbJCtK) widened by more than $17B but was better than the $24B widening expected by analysts, as the gap was reflected by the increasing goods deficit.\n\n[Here](https://ibb.co/3smh0PD) are the most interesting economic events and data scheduled for the short week of trading with most of the important stuff coming on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nWe also do not have many [earnings](https://ibb.co/DgC3MX4) reports this week, with the only company that I am watching being CarMax to see how the red-hot second-hand car market is keeping up. These results could also see other names like Carvana move up or down.\n\nSo, Friday was the last day of trading before [Tesla](https://ibb.co/SNkQLpT) will be a part of the SP500 and this saw the stock surge another 6% to a record high, as the company is up 70% since the news came out. The stock was trading lower towards the end of the day on about 80-90M volume, before a late spike pushed by the index buying saw the volume pop to an incredible 222M with 47M in after-hours [trading](https://ibb.co/6ByprLp). Expect the stock to have a slight pullback in the short-term, as profits will start to be taken from this huge run, especially after the year ends, as people may wait out the profit-taking to avoid tax implications until next year. Tesla is currently down 4% in pre-market [trading](https://ibb.co/hyvK6wt) already, as there are not a lot of people left to buy this company now.\n\nWe also received [news](https://ibb.co/CJPVyMS) late on Friday, that the FDA formally approved the Moderna vaccine and that it will start shipping this week. Moderna is expected to deliver around 20M doses by the end of the year in the US, with the European Union also [expected](https://ibb.co/v3tqMsJ) to rollout the Pfizer vaccine starting after Christmas.\n\nMeanwhile, the only big earnings report that came in on Friday was from [Nike](https://ibb.co/yWrnZqX), as the company crushed earnings, with a beat of 16 cents, up 11% and a revenue beat of $730M also up 9%. Gross margins also improved with Nike direct-to-consumer sales better than expected, as Nike brand digital sales jumped 84% in FQ2 more than the 82% increase in FQ1 with the company setting a target of 50% of the total sales to be made online in the foreseeable future. The company also noted that the revenue will likely be better than previously expected, which helped push the stock more than 4% higher in after-hours.\n\nWe also got a [report](https://ibb.co/8XZrT3Z) from a Morgan Stanley analyst who expected the iPhone to outperform expectations in China based on data through November. I also expect this to be true, and expect Apple to continue to have a significant growth as the 5G cycle will pick up steam in the next years.\n\nIn some other stock market news, [Microsoft](https://ibb.co/gM5F1kF) is reported to be working on their in-house chips for its cloud servers and Surface PCs. This would be another hit to Intel who still holds the biggest market share in the server chip sector, after the recent news of Apple working on its in-house chips for the Macs.\n\nWe also saw the whole bank sector trading significantly higher in after-hours, after the [FED](https://ibb.co/SKk85Xf) announced they will allow them to start buying back shares. This news came after the results of the FED\u2019s second bank stress test in 2020, as all firms remained above minimum capital requirements after taking hypothetical losses. With [Citigroup](https://ibb.co/y0dhzfn) planning to restart stock purchases and pay quarterly dividends, [Morgan Stanley](https://ibb.co/pjMFC5R) already authorizing $10B in buybacks and [JP MORGAN](https://ibb.co/0mFZr0m) signing off on a huge $30B buyback program after the FED decision.\n\nLet\u2019s hope for a recovery in the market as the [futures](https://ibb.co/L0yZqwB) seem to be pointing at a very bad open after the most recent [news](https://ibb.co/M5wJcY6) from Europe, which shows a new strain of the virus believed to have a more than 70% increased transmissibility, but we shouldn\u2019t worry at the moment, as there is no evidence that it has worse symptoms, outcomes or that it isn\u2019t affected by the vaccines just approved from Pfizer &amp; Moderna.\n\nMaybe after Congress votes today, as the Congress is [expected](https://ibb.co/x10zj57) to vote on a $900B aid package today, the second biggest in history, with Trump also supporting the bill, which will provide $600 direct payments to individuals and a $300/week in boosted unemployment benefits, with money also included for small businesses, food assistance, vaccine distribution and more. The bill is also expected to extend the moratorium on foreclosures and provide $25B in rental aids while also giving support to the [airlines](https://ibb.co/0ZP1YQV) with more than $15B to reinstate payroll reimbursements. \n\nMy belief is that the market was poised for a healthy correction, but I don\u2019t think this is a long-term problem for the stock market.\n\nThank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content! Be sure to leave a comment down below with your opinion on the stock market!\n\nHave a great day and see you next time!",

        "selftext": "Intel is the leader in the integrated design and manufacturing of microprocessors found in PCs and servers. With the rise in interconnectivity of devices, Intel strives to provide the most powerful and energy-efficient silicon solution to any product \"smart and connected.\" The data centers used to facilitate the information stored, analyzed, and accessed by various front-end devices are mostly run with Intel server chips. While the firm has had issues with its 10-nanometer process in recent years, I expect the firm to get back on track with its 7-nanometer process in 2021 with the help of EUV lithography. As cloud computing continues to garner significant investment, Intel's data center group will be an indirect beneficiary. Mobile devices have become the preferred device to perform computing tasks and access data via cloud infrastructures that require considerable server build-outs. This development has provided strong tailwinds for Intel's lucrative server processor business. I believe the Altera and other AI-related acquisitions will help Intel maintain its recent growth trajectory in the space, as customers increasingly seek out customized server solutions. The proliferation of mobile devices has come at the expense of the mature PC market, Intel's historic stronghold, with ARM and its cohorts joining AMD as chief rivals. The rise of artificial intelligence has also unleashed a new competitor in Nvidia for specialized chips to accelerate AI-related workloads. Consequently, Intel has built a broad accelerator portfolio via the acquisition of Altera for FPGAs, Mobileye for computer vision chips used in cars, Nervana neural processors, and Movidius VPUs. Intel reported third-quarter results that could be characterized as a mixed bag, including continued strength in cloud spending and notebook PC demand, while enterprise and government data center sales fell significantly and margins contracted. Management had anticipated these trends, though the ultimate mix skewed more to margin-dilutive products such as 5G networking ASICs and notebook PC CPUs than I had expected. While COVID-19 has accelerated the digital transformation to boost cloud and notebook PC demand to support working and learning from home, other areas of Intel\u2019s broad business have been negatively impacted (such as Internet of Things, Mobileye, and memory). Cloud spending is expected to slowdown after four consecutive quarters of double-digit year-over-year growth for Intel\u2019s cloud-related data center group, or DCG, revenue. Shares Ire down nearly 10% during after-his trading and are back to similar levels to the end of July when Intel announced its 7-nanometer process would be delayed at least six months. CEO Bob Swan reiterated Intel\u2019s 2023 products would be made on either Intel 7-nm fabs or external foundries or a mix of both. I like Intel\u2019s recent deal to sell its NAND business to SK Hynix for $9 billion, as it will allow the company to streamline its focus on its core competencies of CPU design and manufacturing while providing a solid cash infusion. Although the next few quarters are likely to be challenging for the firm as AMD continues to attack Intel\u2019s PC and server CPU dominance, I believe Intel\u2019s 10-nm Tiger Lake notebook CPUs and Ice Lake server CPUs should help it mitigate share loss. I are maintaining my $70 fair value estimate for wide-moat Intel and continue to view shares as undervalued. Third-quarter sales Ire down 4% year over year, as PC-centric sales rose 1% and data-centric sales fell 10%. Management expects fourth-quarter sales of $17.4 billion, which would be down 14% year over year. The cyclical industry in which Intel operates will cause its profitability to fluctuate regardless of how successful it is in tailoring its processors to new markets. my uncertainty rating is medium and reflects the underlying risk faced by Intel regarding the proliferation of mobile devices at the expense of PCs, the expanding role of server processors in its product mix, and the advancement of technology nodes to 10-nanometer, 7-nanometer, and so on. Relative to other semiconductor firms, I do believe Intel\u2019s scale and market position will allow it to better handle volatility than smaller peers, leading to my medium rating in lieu of high that is commonplace for other semiconductor firms. In the PC space, any misstep by Intel could lead to AMD capturing market share. Any prolonged delay in process technology by Intel would allow other semiconductor manufacturers to quell Intel\u2019s lead and offer processors at the same node as Intel or even surpass it. Recent achievements by Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung seem to have turned this possibility into a reality, with the two foundries reaching the 7-nanometer node (in high volume capacity) in 2018, while Intel pushed out its 10-nanometer products to 2019. I note that not all processes are created equally, however, with nomenclatures serving as marketing terms over precise dimensions, but Intel's 10-nm delays are still concerning, particularly as AMD is making products on TSMC\u2019s 7-nm process.\n\nTLDR 60C 3/19 fuck it\nI legit just replaced we and our with I and me from morningstar",

        "selftext": "As most of you probably know, Apple recently switched from using Intel CPU's to Apple's proprietary M1 chip. But what does this actually mean for Apple as a company?\n\nAccording to Forbes ( https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/11/11/why-apples-switch-from-intel-will-be-highly-lucrative/ ) Apple could save up to $110 per Laptop/Desktop. This is a significant amount of money per unit added back into Apple's bottom line.\n\nAnd Apple says that Mac Laptops/Desktops make up roughly 9% of their net revenue ( https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/FY20_Q4_Consolidated_Financial_Statements.pdf )\n\nSo I'm no mathematician. But I do know that Apple's new line of computers is retailing for a very similar price to last generations Intel based lineup. In addition to money saving, these new Mac's also become more energy efficient, storage efficient, and performance efficient. And Intel based PC's (to my knowledge) can't compete with all 3 of these benefits at the same price point or form factor. \n\nSo what does this Joe Shmoe think? I think this holiday season a lot of people are going to be getting new computer's and I think for the price and performance a good portion of those gifts will be Mac's. I think that this computer generation is going to make a statement. And I cannot wait for Apple's Q1 earnings report next year. Apple is expanding its profit margin and computer market share. Things look bright short and long term.",

        "selftext": "With all the IPO craze weve been seeing right now, its kinda hard to recommend anyone buying into them.( still kinda chocked to see that this opened at 250%.) In fact, ive been recommending more people to move into SPAC plays instead because of the limited downside and room for price discovery especially for the retail investors like us. Investing in a good spac near nav is literally a no brainer and free tendies. That being said, since I have already done the research and a write up for Abcellera, might as well share it with everyone. Please keep in mind that im not recommending people buying into nor do I have a position in this stock. To be quite frankly, no way in hell should this company be trading at such level yet, at least not in another few years to come. But here you go:\n\nWe are talking about a company **backed by Bill Gates and has Peter Thiel as the board of director to bring the table experience in scaling technology companies (Daddy Thiel actually owns a stake of the company)**. Abcellera is a company **that helped Lily with the development of the antibody cocktail for COVID at a record-breaking speed** and is entitled to receive percentage of the proceeds that Lily receives from the sales. Currently US government has secured 300,000 does with the option to secure 70,000 more and Canada has secured 26,000 doses with more to come. **Abcellera has been cash flow positive every year since inception and has shown an annual revenue growth rate of 100% over the past 5 years and is here to print ya\u2019ll motherfuckers some real serious tendies.**\n\nAbout Abcellera\n\nAbcellera is a technology company that searches, decodes, and analyzes natural immune systems to find antibodies that can be developed to prevent and treat disease through artificial intelligence, machine learning and advanced technology platform. **Traditional biotech industries usually take too long, cost too much and fails way too often. Drugs discovery usually takes 5 to 15 years with less than 5% success rate and cost billions of dollars to find approved molecules. Abcellera provides the teams and technologies that work broadly with the biotech industries to put the best science and best innovator in touch with the best technology to get faster drugs to patients.** Abcellera essentially **solves the two fundamental problems that hinder the discovery and the development of next generation antibody- based therapeutics. The first is the technology: because of the limitations of legacy discovery approaches, there are many well validated targets for which suitable antibodies cannot be found. The second is access: most companies are forced to cobble together fragmented solutions and lack the facilities and expertise needed to prosecute their antibody programs. Both problems contribute to the rising cost of drug development and delay brining needed therapies to patients.** With the leverage of Abcellera\u2019s technology, Eli Lily was able to put out COVID-19 antibody cocktail to trials within a record-breaking speed of just 3 months. Abcellera was able screen through 5.5mil + immune cells to see which makes antibodies on Day 4, find 2K+ potential antibodies that could stick to the virus surface on Day 6, sequence through DNA of 500+ antibodies that could stick to virus spike protein on Day 9, select 190 most promising antibodies for potency testing on Day 17, and finally select 24 antibody front runners for Eli Lily to further develop them into antibody cocktail. Within the past 3 years, **Abcellera has already accrued more than 40 deals, engaged in 94 discovery programs, and under contracted with 26 partners.** **With validation from the partnerships with major biotech firms, it signifies the effectiveness and the reliability of the platform setting Abcellera up for a more lucrative terms and deals in the future.** Through the partnership agreements, Abcellera **will collect near-term payment for technology access, research and intellectual property right, and downstream payments in form of clinical and commercial milestones and royalties on net sales. (Three parts income source model)**\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\n\nHow big is antibody therapy?\n\nAntibody therapy has already been one of the biggest discoveries and is not a thing of the future rather the thing of the present. In 2019\\*\\*, 7 out of 10 of the best-selling drugs were monoclonal antibodies.\\*\\* **The global therapeutic monoclonal antibody market has been valued at 150bil by the end of 2019 and 300bil by 2025** with many drugs already approved for treating cancers, autoimmune, metabolic and infectious diseases.\n\nCompetitive landscape\n\nAlthough there are a few of companies developing antibody therapy drugs, they are not the direct competitors of Abcellera. **The purpose of Abcellera is to provide the technology for the biotech companies especially the small to medium firms the ability to compete on the same playing field as the big boys or act as a more cost-effective way of developing new drugs.** (Think of it as the biotech version of TSMC where it provides AMD the ability to compete or over taking Intel, or acts as a more cost-effective ways for chip designers like Apple and Qualcomm to push out chips.) **Over 90% of the antibody market is dominated by 8 companies and Abcellera is here to shake the ground.**\n\nNotable highlights and future plans for the past months:\n\n\\- Named on the fierce biotech\u2019s fierce 15 list company of 2020\n\n\\- Partnership with Invetx to develop new antibody therapies to improve the quality of life of animals and to bring next generation veterinary therapeutics to the market\n\n\\- Partnership with Kodiak science to develop eye disease antibodies\n\n\\- Partnership with IGM biosciences\n\n\\- Acquisition of Ttianni ( a company for developing humanized mice that is designed to maximize immune responses, increase antibody diversity, and preserve natural mutation of fully human antibodies in rodents)\n\n\\- Acquisition of OrthMab (a clinically validated platform that uses the most advanced computational and experimental protein engineering methods to create bispecific antibodies from any two antibody sequences.)",

It's insanely undervalued. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom BBY last earnings call - \u201cFrom a profitability standpoint, our better-than-expected sales resulted in significant operating income rate expansion and earnings growth,\u201d stated Best Buy CEO Corie Barry. \n\nBBY is hands down the best managed retailer out there. So why is the stock tanking for the last 2 months? Because analysts are retarded and things have changed since the last reputable analyst call. Goldman downgraded the stock early december since they don't see how it can continue to grow. Since then, we have had $600 in direct payments AND we might get another $2,000. Last stimulus, majority of it went to durable goods aka electronics. The government wants to straight up give you money to buy PS5 AND Xbox with a 65\" TV to go along with it. Good thing BBY sells all of these AND they are preferred for electronics over any other retailers. \n\nBut analysts don't want you to know that. Smart money is already accumulating BBY while you yolo PLTR. \n\nHere's what 4hour on BBY looks like right now: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/telh37ss4z761.png?width=999&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9cbe2f91589dac3a165fd30cd40fdd8be4304ea\n\nWhat the fuck do those yellow balls mean?

        "selftext": "**The stimulus package is finally here. Tesla enters the SP500 while Nike posts blowout earnings. Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news**\n\n**\\~Very Long Post\\~**\n\nHello everyone and Good morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of Friday, as we saw all 3 big indexes finishing down for the day with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/vh3NzhK) losing more than 0.4% falling as lawmakers continued to [struggle](https://ibb.co/mcHVyNh) on the stimulus bill, but finishing half a percent up for the week, the SP500 losing 0.35% but rising by 1.4% for the week and the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/sCNjHGy) only down 0.07% while posting a huge 3% gain for the week. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/HpF7kz2) dropping again more than 1.6% on Friday and finishing almost 7.5% down for the [week](https://ibb.co/j3CzN3m).\n\nWe saw a massive day of trading on [Friday](https://ibb.co/72Q668L) with almost 80% of the companies trading above average volume, as it was quadruple witching day, and people had to move a lot of stocks to make room for the Tesla SP500 inclusion, but most companies lost ground despite this huge volume with the biggest losers being the Real estate and Energy sectors, losing around 1.7% for the day, while there were only a few [sectors](https://ibb.co/cwsj2b2) that had small gains with Materials leading the way in a late rally, as value plays suffered while growth companies were gaining on [Friday](https://ibb.co/gjvKvP8).\n\nHere is the HEAT MAP from [FRIDAY](https://ibb.co/5nhchr6), mostly RED as you can see, with INTEL losing more than 6% after the Microsoft [news](https://ibb.co/gM5F1kF), while Tesla spiked in the closing moments almost 6% after trading down in the last hours of the day.\n\nFor the week though, this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/y0tPpHR) shows that most companies were gaining significant ground, with the biggest companies in the world Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft being up significantly for the week, while Google which was hit by several outages and a couple of antitrust lawsuits was trading down. We also saw the Energy sector doing pretty bad for the week with most of the companies losing ground, while Tesla was the biggest gainer heading into the SP500 inclusion.\n\nWe also got some economic data, that showed the November leading [INDICATORS](https://ibb.co/Q6dkKVd) up 0.6% to 109.1, better than expected with manufacturing orders, residential construction permits and initial claims for unemployment insurance moving the number higher.\n\nWhile the Q3 account [deficit](https://ibb.co/4mbJCtK) widened by more than $17B but was better than the $24B widening expected by analysts, as the gap was reflected by the increasing goods deficit.\n\n[Here](https://ibb.co/3smh0PD) are the most interesting economic events and data scheduled for the short week of trading with most of the important stuff coming on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nWe also do not have many [earnings](https://ibb.co/DgC3MX4) reports this week, with the only company that I am watching being CarMax to see how the red-hot second-hand car market is keeping up. These results could also see other names like Carvana move up or down.\n\nSo, Friday was the last day of trading before [Tesla](https://ibb.co/SNkQLpT) will be a part of the SP500 and this saw the stock surge another 6% to a record high, as the company is up 70% since the news came out. The stock was trading lower towards the end of the day on about 80-90M volume, before a late spike pushed by the index buying saw the volume pop to an incredible 222M with 47M in after-hours [trading](https://ibb.co/6ByprLp). Expect the stock to have a slight pullback in the short-term, as profits will start to be taken from this huge run, especially after the year ends, as people may wait out the profit-taking to avoid tax implications until next year. Tesla is currently down 4% in pre-market [trading](https://ibb.co/hyvK6wt) already, as there are not a lot of people left to buy this company now.\n\nWe also received [news](https://ibb.co/CJPVyMS) late on Friday, that the FDA formally approved the Moderna vaccine and that it will start shipping this week. Moderna is expected to deliver around 20M doses by the end of the year in the US, with the European Union also [expected](https://ibb.co/v3tqMsJ) to rollout the Pfizer vaccine starting after Christmas.\n\nMeanwhile, the only big earnings report that came in on Friday was from [Nike](https://ibb.co/yWrnZqX), as the company crushed earnings, with a beat of 16 cents, up 11% and a revenue beat of $730M also up 9%. Gross margins also improved with Nike direct-to-consumer sales better than expected, as Nike brand digital sales jumped 84% in FQ2 more than the 82% increase in FQ1 with the company setting a target of 50% of the total sales to be made online in the foreseeable future. The company also noted that the revenue will likely be better than previously expected, which helped push the stock more than 4% higher in after-hours.\n\nWe also got a [report](https://ibb.co/8XZrT3Z) from a Morgan Stanley analyst who expected the iPhone to outperform expectations in China based on data through November. I also expect this to be true, and expect Apple to continue to have a significant growth as the 5G cycle will pick up steam in the next years.\n\nIn some other stock market news, [Microsoft](https://ibb.co/gM5F1kF) is reported to be working on their in-house chips for its cloud servers and Surface PCs. This would be another hit to Intel who still holds the biggest market share in the server chip sector, after the recent news of Apple working on its in-house chips for the Macs.\n\nWe also saw the whole bank sector trading significantly higher in after-hours, after the [FED](https://ibb.co/SKk85Xf) announced they will allow them to start buying back shares. This news came after the results of the FED\u2019s second bank stress test in 2020, as all firms remained above minimum capital requirements after taking hypothetical losses. With [Citigroup](https://ibb.co/y0dhzfn) planning to restart stock purchases and pay quarterly dividends, [Morgan Stanley](https://ibb.co/pjMFC5R) already authorizing $10B in buybacks and [JP MORGAN](https://ibb.co/0mFZr0m) signing off on a huge $30B buyback program after the FED decision.\n\nLet\u2019s hope for a recovery in the market as the [futures](https://ibb.co/L0yZqwB) seem to be pointing at a very bad open after the most recent [news](https://ibb.co/M5wJcY6) from Europe, which shows a new strain of the virus believed to have a more than 70% increased transmissibility, but we shouldn\u2019t worry at the moment, as there is no evidence that it has worse symptoms, outcomes or that it isn\u2019t affected by the vaccines just approved from Pfizer &amp; Moderna.\n\nMaybe after Congress votes today, as the Congress is [expected](https://ibb.co/x10zj57) to vote on a $900B aid package today, the second biggest in history, with Trump also supporting the bill, which will provide $600 direct payments to individuals and a $300/week in boosted unemployment benefits, with money also included for small businesses, food assistance, vaccine distribution and more. The bill is also expected to extend the moratorium on foreclosures and provide $25B in rental aids while also giving support to the [airlines](https://ibb.co/0ZP1YQV) with more than $15B to reinstate payroll reimbursements. \n\nMy belief is that the market was poised for a healthy correction, but I don\u2019t think this is a long-term problem for the stock market.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "**Should you get into stocks that benefit from the booming housing market? Is the workout at home trade done? Intel stops the bleeding while Apple loses lawsuit. Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw all 3 big indexes closing the day in the red despite hitting intraday records, with the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/PCN8dwz) losing .38%, while both the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/cDjpNKP) and the [DOW JONES](https://ibb.co/RydQj61) Industrial finished the day down just over .2% as we also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/44wGzR0) rising by more than 4% yesterday as the $2000 stimulus was [BLOCKED](https://ibb.co/WFNSpCH) in the Senate by McConnell and the Georgia Senate runoff election is just a week away.\n\nAlmost 70% of the [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/LYM4JfL) were declining yesterday on below average volume as the number of companies that were trading above the 50-day moving average fell under 70% for the first time in quite a while.\n\nWe saw 9 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/GRJSmht) closing in the red yesterday, with only the Health Care and Consumer Discretionary sectors having small gains as almost all the types of companies were losing ground [YESTERDAY](https://ibb.co/7tKPyP4), especially the small-caps with the small-cap growth group losing more than 2%.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/KjVsn9X) from yesterday, it\u2019s mostly red, with only a couple of companies that were gaining big like the Chinese companies alongside Amazon and Intel.HEAT\n\nWe also got some economic data yesterday, as a review of the 2020 aviation and air travel [ESTIMATED](https://ibb.co/hRbYxpG) that traffic will be down 67% since last year, dropping to levels not seen since 1999, as air travel is still struggling to come back after the march bottoms. This has affected most of the [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/FBq4g37) worldwide but it seems that China airlines is doing somewhat better with the biggest percentage of the total number of flights completed compared to last year.\n\nThe SP Home price [INDICES](https://ibb.co/W67RBYh) also came in better than expected with the National Index increasing by 1.4% M/M, as this is a leading measure of real estate prices, gaining 8.4% nationwide over year ago.\n\nThese moves can also be seen in the latest Redfin report, as home sales [PRICES](https://ibb.co/CwR5H56) are up 14% year/year to over $320K with a great increase in pending [SALES](https://ibb.co/mJtrwV9) which are also up more than 34% since last year, as the number of active [LISTINGS](https://ibb.co/vVkfMMh) of home sales is down more than 30%, as buyers can\u2019t snatch them up quick enough with such low [YIELDS](https://ibb.co/7j1kY3s), as this has led for the [AVERAGE](https://ibb.co/gzQq8Wb) sale price to list value to rise to 99.4% which Is up 1.5% since 2019. This should be good news for companies like Toll Brothers, Lennar, HD and LOW.\n\nThis was also accompanied by the great numbers in the us chain store sales [NUMBERS](https://ibb.co/4PykPcH), which rose by almost 9% y/y with December sales expected to rise almost 5% since last year and a .2% increase since last month.\n\nWhile [TODAY](https://ibb.co/8N3YMPV) we start the day with MBA Mortgage applications, home sales and the Chicago PMI alongside advance reads on many other data points.\n\nIn some other stock market [NEWS](https://ibb.co/q1J6Snv), we saw Apple cool of a little yesterday, losing more than 1% for the day while they also lost a lawsuit aimed of stopping Corellium using virtual iPhone for security researching in the operating system, while [INTEL](https://ibb.co/3vvXFGT) finally got a breather and recovered some of the recent loses, after an activist hedge fund manager pushed for strategic changes in the company as Intel is losing market share and top designers, with the company also [ISSUING](https://ibb.co/WgtwTrY) a statement that lifted spirits around the stock.\n\nWe also saw the [FAA](https://ibb.co/6rJ6bHd) introduce new rules for drones, this may have a big impact on companies like UPS, Walmart and Amazon, as all of them have started trials for drone-delivery, as this could lead to better margins for the companies.\n\nThe Fed also [EXTENDED](https://ibb.co/cxV3HkC) the main street lending programs until Jan. 8 with the approval of Mnuchin as they try to process a bunch of applications this month, this means we can get even more money put into the economy and eventually the stock markets which is good news.\n\nAnd meanwhile, AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine was [APPROVED](https://ibb.co/y5QWbmh) for emergency use in the UK, this is another weapon to find this freaking illness, while JNJ will give us some results in early 2021 and Novavax just started their trial in the US.\n\nAlso, one last piece of data that I found recently shows that there was indeed a huge spike this [YEAR](https://ibb.co/JrKw01B) in the move to live streaming video and pre-recorded videos this year, as this has boosted companies like Peloton, Lululemon and others.\n\nBut this trend is seen slowing down in the next years with just a 4% [CAGR](https://ibb.co/HGhFJXS) in the equipment market, but that the exercise apps will see a big [GROWTH](https://ibb.co/02wm273) in the next years, so there are 2 different POV. I wouldn\u2019t stay invested in companies like PTON right now, I\u2019d rather take profits and move to other areas in the stock market. But don\u2019t rush into companies like which have diluted their stock a lot or have lots of debt\u2026 this will not recover so fast...\n\nLet\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/nbV49Bs) seem to be pointing at a good open, with all 3 big indexes in the green as the Nasdaq is leading the way.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "As most of you YOLO your life savings to fuck Melvin Capital, I couldn't help but brainstorm potential growth avenues and progression of the GME business model. Here are some ideas I would like to  have a discussion if it's feasible.\n\nHere are things I feel GME could do to become a leader or disruptor in the current environment. Ultimately, the goal is that these strategies improve the customer experience, retention and loyalty and make GME $$$$. \n\n1. Start a subscription box immediately. Leverage the GME user base and data. This would further benefit in a distribution centre future model.  If barkbox is a $1B business in subscription boxes, video games can easily do the same.  Think about all the avenues and options for a proper video game subscription boxes. Even if you dont want games, you could have a swag/figurines box, addons are easy here. Think of the different sub tiers, Used model subscription box, games under $40, or even a high end new release $80 monthly sub.  This is further improved if they have a gamestop membership or discounts on 12 year boxes vs month to month. \n2. Develop an online gaming platform similar GOG/Steam for PC gaming. Why would they use this instead, well ideally they would get additional discounts from being a PowerUp member, which could make them competitive. What would be even cooler is if this platform somehow connected with both your xbox game pass or your ps network so you could play everything u wanted from the same platform on pc. This would benefit sony and microsoft if users got their memberships through gamestop, as it still adds to their userbase. GME would require an excellent value offer to take users away from established platforms imo. \n3. Create a platform specifically for trading rare collectibles. Be both the middleman and vendor for the trade/selling of unique, rare and valuable collectibles, arcade machines etc... I feel like this is a niche that is quite hidden and needs a reputable leader to take the charge. Also could lead to a lot of good PR if there are rare sales that have taken place on a reputable platform. This is harder to execute logistically but could be worthwhile if they became an authority in collectibles; knowledgeable staff and experts are key here. Not sure how big this market really is.\n4. Become the leader in tabletop gaming. Again reputable staff and expertise needed, maybe an acquisition like boardgamegeek. Here's a niche that could use a leader. \n5. Sponsor/Host major e-sports events. (WoW's world first race was a good example recently of what they sponsored).  Gamestop should become an event broadcaster.  Okay well this i dont know the logistics behind this but it feels like in NA a reliable event broadcasting/streaming/distrubution host in gaming is lacking  - and moving to technology based future means this could be something to explore. Often times there is not a reliable backer to these things and this is where GME could step in. But major competitive esports, (league, ow, wow, cs:go, apex, fortnite etc..) there are plenty.  Pipe dream when they are ballin: SOMEHOW BECOME A MAJOR EVENT HOST LIKE IEM (INTEL EXTREME MASTERS). \n6. If they cant host a major pro event then they should 100% try and host an annual NON-PRO competition. A large tournament for regular dudes to try and become the best at madden or halo or . They could stream and advertise the shit out of this thing. It could become a really huge event catered to people who actually shop at gamestop. This is fundamental in becoming a  cultural gaming hub and icon. \n7. Improve their online presence and customer interaction. BECOME THE AUTHORITY IN GAMES AND SHOW IT. PARTNER WITH STREAMERS. REVIEW OR SPOTLIGHT GAMES, EARLY ACCESS, INTERVIEW DEVELOPERS. START A YOUTUBE CHANNEL, 24/7 TWITCH CHANNEL. \n8. Partner with UBER or Doordash to get same day delivery guaranteed. \n\nWhat other crazy shit can they do?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions:  a shit ton of shares and leaps. lets goo baby.",

The New York-based fund has amassed a nearly $1 billion stake in Intel, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nLoeb said in the letter that Intel's most urgent task was addressing its \"human capital management issue\", as many of its talented chip designers have fled, \"demoralized by the status quo\".\n\nIntel has lost its pole position in microprocessor manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co and South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Loeb wrote in the letter.\n\nIntel is also losing market share in its core PC and data center markets to Advanced Micro Devices Inc, Loeb added. NVIDIA Corp is dominating computational models used in artificial intelligence applications, while Intel has been largely absent in this nascent market, according to the letter.\n\n\"Without immediate change at Intel, we fear that America's access to leading-edge semiconductor supply will erode, forcing the U.S. to rely more heavily on a geopolitically unstable East Asia to power everything from PCs to data centers to critical infrastructure and more,\" Loeb wrote.\n\nIntel did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nLoeb asked Intel to retain an investment advisor to evaluate strategic alternatives, according to the letter. Third Point believes that Intel should consider separating its chip design from its semiconductor fabrication plant manufacturing operations, according to the sources. This could include a joint venture in manufacturing, according to the sources.\n\nIntel customers, such as Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp and [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) Inc, are developing their own in-house silicon solutions and sending those designs to be manufactured in East Asia, Loeb wrote. He suggested Intel must offer new solutions to retain these customers rather than have them send their manufacturing away.\n\nThird Point, which has $15 billion in assets under management, has experience in pushing companies to pursue deals, including at Prudential Plc, Yum! Brands Inc, Dow Chemical and United Technologies\"\n\nIf anyone was wondering why INTC jumped today, it's this. Hope this triggers some action within the company.",

        "selftext": "What's up fellas at Options. I made a tool called [FD Ranker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/fd-ranker) that logs the average IV of popular tickers. The tool is inclusive of almost 1,000 tickers now.\n\n**What is this tool good for**\n\nI posted in ThetaGang the list with HIGH IV options which is great for running the wheel or selling options. This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is near the lows and almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher. Do your DD before entering any positions!\n\nIf you guys find this list useful (it's my first time posting this here), I can make this a weekly/weekend thing. I like doing it on Sundays so I can prepare for the trading week ahead.\n\n# High IV Tickers List\n\n\\*Some of the market cap data is off, so always double check before entering any plays! Also, the \"next earnings date\" data will resume starting in January, 2021 (very soon).\n\nPlease note this list is only inclusive of the more popular tickers mentioned around Reddit.

See some of the news articles that were released this weekend by various media outlets\n\nNBC: 12/19/2020 [https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/suspected-russian-hack-was-it-epic-cyber-attack-or-spy-n1251766](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/suspected-russian-hack-was-it-epic-cyber-attack-or-spy-n1251766)\n\nCTV: 12/18/2020 [https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/america-votes/with-trump-silent-reprisals-for-cyber-hacks-may-fall-to-biden-1.5236837](https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/america-votes/with-trump-silent-reprisals-for-cyber-hacks-may-fall-to-biden-1.5236837)\n\nUSA Today: 12/19/2020 [https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/12/18/cybersecurity-hack-attack-5-things-you-can-do-protect-yourself/3963057001/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/12/18/cybersecurity-hack-attack-5-things-you-can-do-protect-yourself/3963057001/)\n\nCNN: 12/18/2020 [https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2020/12/17/us-government-agencies-hack-biden-trump-marquardt-nr-sot-vpx.cnn](https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2020/12/17/us-government-agencies-hack-biden-trump-marquardt-nr-sot-vpx.cnn)\n\nGlobal News: 12/19/2020 [https://globalnews.ca/news/7476152/govt-agency-infrastructure-risk-from-cyber-attacks/](https://globalnews.ca/news/7476152/govt-agency-infrastructure-risk-from-cyber-attacks/)\n\nYou can bet your mom's 8 ball that boomers will be hopping into Cyber Stocks come Monday morning after being late to the party and reading about the breach on the weekend. Hopping into any cyber security related stock that posted gains on Friday.\n\nWhenever there is large media attention around a specific sector, the stock poised to gain the most is the lowest float/market cap play.\n\nBiden Weed Pump: SNDL rose 200% due to its small market cap, compared to industry average of 40% during this period\n\nBiden Solar Pump: SOL/SUNW rose 100%+ due to small market cap, compared to industry average of 50% during this period\n\nWhenever there is a multi day runner catalyst event, the stocks that ran the hardest on the first day are the ones that continue to pump for the rest of the week/month.\n\n**Why $CYRN has the most to gain:**\n\n$CYRN provides services to over 1.3 billion clients at the moment. Along with many large corporation including Google, Microsoft, The Walt Disney Company, Dell, Checkpoint, HP, T-Mobile, and McAfee are a few of the other corporations that trust Cyren to play a role in their cloud security arsenals.\n\n[https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-endpoint/web-content-filtering-with-microsoft-defender-atp-now-in-public/ba-p/1132287](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-endpoint/web-content-filtering-with-microsoft-defender-atp-now-in-public/ba-p/1132287)\n\n$CYRN is currently trading 30% below its ATH, while all other stocks mentioned above are at their ATH's from Fridays news.\n\n$CYRN's tradeable active float is only 18.1m. With institutions owning 67% of the float. A large portion of this float was traded in the last hour on Friday (47.5%) resulting in a 50% gain going into close.\n\nJust based on the low float and media coverage, I expect CYRN to continue to pump into the 2's and possible higher throughout the week. If they put out a fluff article about working with MSFT and organizations affected by the SWI Hack that are already in their database and active customers this could see a 200%+ day.\n\nThis is a short term play, get in with the hype and hop out by next week unless there are new catalysts that arise.

        "selftext": "New computer parts like Graphics cards and CPU\u2019s are selling out immediately and selling for a lot higher than their retail price on the secondary market. This is something the Gaming PC space has not seen at this level before and it shows just how high the demand is for gaming PC\u2019s right now. Stocks like AMD and Nvidia might seem like the best stocks to buy because it\u2019s their parts that are selling out selling out. However they are such big companies and we wont see their prices go to the moon. While I do recommend buying AMD because of their recent leaps in CPU dominance over intel, their new  gaming GPU (6900XT) that is faster than Nvidia for the first time in years (and for 2/3 the price no less) and the fact that they make the Silicon for both the PS5 and new Xbox. I would not expect AMD to moon just became of Christmas Sales, it\u2019s more of a long term play. However With this new spotlight on the PC gaming market, Corsair should see a massive increase in revenue. If you know anything about PC gaming you know the name Corsair. I for one own multiple Corsair products and am very happy with them, which is why I bought Corsair at IPO a few months ago. All kids want this year is Consoles and Gaming PC\u2019s and even professionals have started investing more money into the PC space because they are on their computers all day due to the pandemic. All this crazy demand around the PC space 100% helps Corsair. They are a huge player in the PC market and they make everything from custom water cooling parts for PC enthusiasts to headsets for console gamers. Corsair also owns El Gato. El Gato makes products such as screen capture cards and webcams, things that have seen a huge increase in sales during the pandemic due to their usefulness in online meetings. All this combined makes Corsair a necessary stock to own this Christmas Season.",

        "selftext": "  \n\nWith all the IPO craze weve been seeing right now, its kinda hard to recommend anyone buying into them.( still kinda chocked to see that this opened at 250%.) In fact, ive been recommending more people to move into SPAC plays instead because of the limited downside and room for price discovery especially for the retail investors like us. Investing in a good spac near nav is literally a no brainer and free tendies. That being said, since I have already done the research and a write up for Abcellera, might as well share it with everyone. Please keep in mind that im not recommending people buying into nor do I have a position in this stock. To be quite frankly, no way in hell should this company be trading at such level yet, at least not in another few years to come. But here you go:\n\nWe are talking about a company **backed by Bill Gates and has Peter Thiel as the board of director to bring the table experience in scaling technology companies (Daddy Thiel actually owns a stake of the company)**. Abcellera is a company **that helped Lily with the development of the antibody cocktail for COVID at a record-breaking speed** and is entitled to receive percentage of the proceeds that Lily receives from the sales. Currently US government has secured 300,000 does with the option to secure 70,000 more and Canada has secured 26,000 doses with more to come. **Abcellera has been cash flow positive every year since inception and has shown an annual revenue growth rate of 100% over the past 5 years and is here to print ya\u2019ll motherfuckers some real serious tendies.**\n\nAbout Abcellera\n\nAbcellera is a technology company that searches, decodes, and analyzes natural immune systems to find antibodies that can be developed to prevent and treat disease through artificial intelligence, machine learning and advanced technology platform. **Traditional biotech industries usually take too long, cost too much and fails way too often. Drugs discovery usually takes 5 to 15 years with less than 5% success rate and cost billions of dollars to find approved molecules. Abcellera provides the teams and technologies that work broadly with the biotech industries to put the best science and best innovator in touch with the best technology to get faster drugs to patients.** Abcellera essentially **solves the two fundamental problems that hinder the discovery and the development of next generation antibody- based therapeutics. The first is the technology: because of the limitations of legacy discovery approaches, there are many well validated targets for which suitable antibodies cannot be found. The second is access: most companies are forced to cobble together fragmented solutions and lack the facilities and expertise needed to prosecute their antibody programs. Both problems contribute to the rising cost of drug development and delay brining needed therapies to patients.** With the leverage of Abcellera\u2019s technology, Eli Lily was able to put out COVID-19 antibody cocktail to trials within a record-breaking speed of just 3 months. Abcellera was able screen through 5.5mil + immune cells to see which makes antibodies on Day 4, find 2K+ potential antibodies that could stick to the virus surface on Day 6, sequence through DNA of 500+ antibodies that could stick to virus spike protein on Day 9, select 190 most promising antibodies for potency testing on Day 17, and finally select 24 antibody front runners for Eli Lily to further develop them into antibody cocktail. Within the past 3 years, **Abcellera has already accrued more than 40 deals, engaged in 94 discovery programs, and under contracted with 26 partners.** **With validation from the partnerships with major biotech firms, it signifies the effectiveness and the reliability of the platform setting Abcellera up for a more lucrative terms and deals in the future.** Through the partnership agreements, Abcellera **will collect near-term payment for technology access, research and intellectual property right, and downstream payments in form of clinical and commercial milestones and royalties on net sales. (Three parts income source model)**\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nHow big is antibody therapy?\n\nAntibody therapy has already been one of the biggest discoveries and is not a thing of the future rather the thing of the present. In 2019**, 7 out of 10 of the best-selling drugs were monoclonal antibodies.** **The global therapeutic monoclonal antibody market has been valued at 150bil by the end of 2019 and 300bil by 2025** with many drugs already approved for treating cancers, autoimmune, metabolic and infectious diseases.  \n\nCompetitive landscape \n\nAlthough there are a few of companies developing antibody therapy drugs, they are not the direct competitors of Abcellera. **The purpose of Abcellera is to provide the technology for the biotech companies especially the small to medium firms the ability to compete on the same playing field as the big boys or act as a more cost-effective way of developing new drugs.** (Think of it as the biotech version of TSMC where it provides AMD the ability to compete or over taking Intel, or acts as a more cost-effective ways for chip designers like Apple and Qualcomm to push out chips.) **Over 90% of the antibody market is dominated by 8 companies and Abcellera is here to shake the ground.** \n\nNotable highlights and future plans for the past months:\n\n\\- Named on the fierce biotech\u2019s fierce 15 list company of 2020\n\n\\- Partnership with Invetx to develop new antibody therapies to improve the quality of life of animals and to bring next generation veterinary therapeutics to the market\n\n\\- Partnership with Kodiak science to develop eye disease antibodies\n\n\\- Partnership with IGM biosciences \n\n\\- Acquisition of Ttianni ( a company for developing humanized mice that is designed to maximize immune responses, increase antibody diversity, and preserve natural mutation of fully human antibodies in rodents)\n\n\\- Acquisition of OrthMab (a clinically validated platform that uses the most advanced computational and experimental protein engineering methods to create bispecific antibodies from any two antibody sequences.)",

Investors are bullish and confident about their growth. \n\nhttps://www.intc.com/strategic-priorities\n\nRead their fundamentals for yourself: https://www.intc.com/financial-info/financial-results\n\n&gt; At Intel, our\u00a0strategy is to deliver the world\u2019s best semiconductors for an increasingly data-centric world. Over the last few years, we\u2019ve initiated a transition from being a PC-centric company to a data-centric one and expanded our product offerings in order to seize new market opportunities.\u00a0\n\n&gt; By focusing on our four strategic priorities \u2013 accelerating the growth of the company, improving our execution, thoughtfully deploying our capital and evolving our culture \u2013 we can have a larger impact on our customers\u2019 success.\n\nMy $70c april 2021 already printed 250% profit from premium. \n\nNow I'm in $55c 01/21/22 long\n\n&gt; 2024 Total Addressable Market: ~$300B\n\n&gt; Based on our analytics, we anticipate a total addressable market (TAM) of nearly $300 billion by the year 2024. In addition to this TAM, we also see opportunities beyond silicon in areas like software and services.\n\nThe memes and kiddy investors think Intel is going down so the IV is low and premiums are at a good price. The bears are always wrong about tech stocks. They think intel is some kind of shitty company that doesn't have the worlds leading market movers invested in their success, I dont know maybe I'm wrong about their thoughts. I can't read their minds but I can read Intels press releases and figures.\n\nNews like this about AI, maybe it's not gaming performance but that's not what we are here to talk about:\n\n&gt; Intel Announces Unmatched AI and Analytics Platform with New Processor, Memory, Storage and FPGA Solutions\n\nhttps://newsroom.intel.com/news/intel-announces-unmatched-ai-analytics-platform-new-processor-memory-storage-fpga/#gs.n7nrs7\n\n&gt; Why It\u2019s Important:\u00a0AI and analytics open new opportunities for customers across a broad range of industries, including finance, healthcare, industrial, telecom and transportation. IDC predicts that by 2021, 75% of commercial enterprise apps will use AI1. And by 2025, IDC estimates that roughly a quarter of all data generated will be created in real time, with various internet of things (IoT) devices creating 95% of that volume growth2.\n\nThey have their hands in Machine Learning, AI, neuroscience and self driving cars...\n\n&gt; Spotlight: Big Bets\n&gt; To be at the forefront of the constant technological change in our industry, we must evaluate new and existing big bets based on the following criteria: the \u201cbet\u201d is leading the edge of a technology inflection, it plays a significant role in our customers\u2019 success, and it offers a clear path to profitability and attractive returns. Our current big bets are memory, autonomous driving, and 5G.\n\nI don't see any reason to logically remain skeptical of Intels consistent year to year performance and market adaptations.\n\nINTC leaps to the moon\n\nEnjoy the new car or house.\n\nHere are the necessary edits I had to include in the post that are responses to trolls, if anyone wants more info and meme defense: \n\nEdit because trolls:\n\nLook at the greeks of the contract if you know how to read them. They are good for this strike price. \n\nIt is a safe and profitable bet with the delta and vega ratings. A 10% increase in the underlying would put it past strike price and net several hundred % return on investment. \n\nI'm sorry if I'm \"casting pearls before swine\" and this is all going everyone's heads like my [$6 ITM PLTR calls I posted last month.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jh2njz/get_in_on_this_while_you_can_pltr_6_itm_call_you/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) But let's stop playing dumb ok? Let's make money.\n\nAlso: because so many people say \"AMD BEat IntEl hurrdprorpdr\" ... The success of AMD in PC gaming doesnt negate Intel's success everywhere else:\n\n&gt; At Intel, our\u00a0strategy is to deliver the world\u2019s best semiconductors for an increasingly data-centric world.

        "selftext": "**The stimulus package is finally here. Tesla enters the SP500 while Nike posts blowout earnings. Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news**\n\n**\\~Very Long Post\\~**\n\nHello everyone and Good morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of Friday, as we saw all 3 big indexes finishing down for the day with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/vh3NzhK) losing more than 0.4% falling as lawmakers continued to [struggle](https://ibb.co/mcHVyNh) on the stimulus bill, but finishing half a percent up for the week, the SP500 losing 0.35% but rising by 1.4% for the week and the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/sCNjHGy) only down 0.07% while posting a huge 3% gain for the week. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/HpF7kz2) dropping again more than 1.6% on Friday and finishing almost 7.5% down for the [week](https://ibb.co/j3CzN3m).\n\nWe saw a massive day of trading on [Friday](https://ibb.co/72Q668L) with almost 80% of the companies trading above average volume, as it was quadruple witching day, and people had to move a lot of stocks to make room for the Tesla SP500 inclusion, but most companies lost ground despite this huge volume with the biggest losers being the Real estate and Energy sectors, losing around 1.7% for the day, while there were only a few [sectors](https://ibb.co/cwsj2b2) that had small gains with Materials leading the way in a late rally, as value plays suffered while growth companies were gaining on [Friday](https://ibb.co/gjvKvP8).\n\nHere is the HEAT MAP from [FRIDAY](https://ibb.co/5nhchr6), mostly RED as you can see, with INTEL losing more than 6% after the Microsoft [news](https://ibb.co/gM5F1kF), while Tesla spiked in the closing moments almost 6% after trading down in the last hours of the day.\n\nFor the week though, this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/y0tPpHR) shows that most companies were gaining significant ground, with the biggest companies in the world Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft being up significantly for the week, while Google which was hit by several outages and a couple of antitrust lawsuits was trading down. We also saw the Energy sector doing pretty bad for the week with most of the companies losing ground, while Tesla was the biggest gainer heading into the SP500 inclusion.\n\nWe also got some economic data, that showed the November leading [INDICATORS](https://ibb.co/Q6dkKVd) up 0.6% to 109.1, better than expected with manufacturing orders, residential construction permits and initial claims for unemployment insurance moving the number higher.\n\nWhile the Q3 account [deficit](https://ibb.co/4mbJCtK) widened by more than $17B but was better than the $24B widening expected by analysts, as the gap was reflected by the increasing goods deficit.\n\n[Here](https://ibb.co/3smh0PD) are the most interesting economic events and data scheduled for the short week of trading with most of the important stuff coming on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nWe also do not have many [earnings](https://ibb.co/DgC3MX4) reports this week, with the only company that I am watching being CarMax to see how the red-hot second-hand car market is keeping up. These results could also see other names like Carvana move up or down.\n\nSo, Friday was the last day of trading before [Tesla](https://ibb.co/SNkQLpT) will be a part of the SP500 and this saw the stock surge another 6% to a record high, as the company is up 70% since the news came out. The stock was trading lower towards the end of the day on about 80-90M volume, before a late spike pushed by the index buying saw the volume pop to an incredible 222M with 47M in after-hours [trading](https://ibb.co/6ByprLp). Expect the stock to have a slight pullback in the short-term, as profits will start to be taken from this huge run, especially after the year ends, as people may wait out the profit-taking to avoid tax implications until next year. Tesla is currently down 4% in pre-market [trading](https://ibb.co/hyvK6wt) already, as there are not a lot of people left to buy this company now.\n\nWe also received [news](https://ibb.co/CJPVyMS) late on Friday, that the FDA formally approved the Moderna vaccine and that it will start shipping this week. Moderna is expected to deliver around 20M doses by the end of the year in the US, with the European Union also [expected](https://ibb.co/v3tqMsJ) to rollout the Pfizer vaccine starting after Christmas.\n\nMeanwhile, the only big earnings report that came in on Friday was from [Nike](https://ibb.co/yWrnZqX), as the company crushed earnings, with a beat of 16 cents, up 11% and a revenue beat of $730M also up 9%. Gross margins also improved with Nike direct-to-consumer sales better than expected, as Nike brand digital sales jumped 84% in FQ2 more than the 82% increase in FQ1 with the company setting a target of 50% of the total sales to be made online in the foreseeable future. The company also noted that the revenue will likely be better than previously expected, which helped push the stock more than 4% higher in after-hours.\n\nWe also got a [report](https://ibb.co/8XZrT3Z) from a Morgan Stanley analyst who expected the iPhone to outperform expectations in China based on data through November. I also expect this to be true, and expect Apple to continue to have a significant growth as the 5G cycle will pick up steam in the next years.\n\nIn some other stock market news, [Microsoft](https://ibb.co/gM5F1kF) is reported to be working on their in-house chips for its cloud servers and Surface PCs. This would be another hit to Intel who still holds the biggest market share in the server chip sector, after the recent news of Apple working on its in-house chips for the Macs.\n\nWe also saw the whole bank sector trading significantly higher in after-hours, after the [FED](https://ibb.co/SKk85Xf) announced they will allow them to start buying back shares. This news came after the results of the FED\u2019s second bank stress test in 2020, as all firms remained above minimum capital requirements after taking hypothetical losses. With [Citigroup](https://ibb.co/y0dhzfn) planning to restart stock purchases and pay quarterly dividends, [Morgan Stanley](https://ibb.co/pjMFC5R) already authorizing $10B in buybacks and [JP MORGAN](https://ibb.co/0mFZr0m) signing off on a huge $30B buyback program after the FED decision.\n\nLet\u2019s hope for a recovery in the market as the [futures](https://ibb.co/L0yZqwB) seem to be pointing at a very bad open after the most recent [news](https://ibb.co/M5wJcY6) from Europe, which shows a new strain of the virus believed to have a more than 70% increased transmissibility, but we shouldn\u2019t worry at the moment, as there is no evidence that it has worse symptoms, outcomes or that it isn\u2019t affected by the vaccines just approved from Pfizer &amp; Moderna.\n\nMaybe after Congress votes today, as the Congress is [expected](https://ibb.co/x10zj57) to vote on a $900B aid package today, the second biggest in history, with Trump also supporting the bill, which will provide $600 direct payments to individuals and a $300/week in boosted unemployment benefits, with money also included for small businesses, food assistance, vaccine distribution and more. The bill is also expected to extend the moratorium on foreclosures and provide $25B in rental aids while also giving support to the [airlines](https://ibb.co/0ZP1YQV) with more than $15B to reinstate payroll reimbursements. \n\nMy belief is that the market was poised for a healthy correction, but I don\u2019t think this is a long-term problem for the stock market.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, December 29, 2020**\n\nStocks dropped Tuesday after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked consideration in the Senate for the recently passed House bill that would increase the monetary amount of the stimulus checks from $600 to $2000. President Trump has also called for the amount in the direct checks to be increased. \n\nLate Monday, the Democratically-controlled House of Representatives voted to pass a bill increasing the amount in the stimulus checks from $600 to $2000, the same amount President Trump demanded last week when he threatened to not sign the new $900 billion stimulus package. However, when the bill was due to reach the Senate floor, Mitch McConnell blocked considerations for the bill and suggested the Senate would only consider the larger payments if Democrats agreed to other demands made by the President, including investigating the security of the 2020 election and removing liability shields for social media companies. Neither demand is likely to garner support among Democrats. \n\nStill, on a positive note, the new $900 billion stimulus package - which includes the $600 stimulus payments, replenished funding for loans through the Paycheck Protection Program, enhanced unemployment benefits, and funds for vaccine distribution, among other measures \u2013 was signed into law late Sunday.\n\nExperts have warned of another surge in coronavirus stemming from holiday travel. According to the TSA, more than 7 million people were screened at airport security points in the US, the second busiest week of travel since Thanksgiving. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert in the United States said, \u201cWe very well might see a post-seasonal -- in the sense of Christmas, New Years -- surge,\u201d implying that holiday travel and private gatherings taking place could lead to another surge in cases, similar to what happened in the weeks following Thanksgiving. \n\nUnfortunately, December has been the nation's deadliest month since the Covid-19 pandemic's start -- with more than 63,000 Americans lost to the virus in the past 29 days. In comparison, the entire month of November saw about 36,964 deaths. The heightened death toll follows a brutal two months that saw the average of daily new coronavirus cases spike from around 90,000 in the beginning of November to over 200,000 by the end of December. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Vice President-elect Kamala Harris received the first dose of the Moderna MRNA Covid-19 vaccine live on television today and urged Americans to get vaccinated for the virus.\n* Boeing's BA 737 MAX resumed passenger flights in the United States for the first time today after a 20-month safety ban was lifted last month.\n* Sichuan Yahua Industrial Group agrees to supply Tesla with battery grade lithium hydroxide from 2021 to 2025, the Chinese firm says in a securities filing with the Shenzhen Stock Exchange\n* Apple AAPL opened at a record-high this morning before pulling back throughout the day\n* Cloud-company company Qualtrics set to go public soon. Initial price range estimated to be between $20-$24 with a valuation of $12-14 billion\n* China\u2019s central bank said Alibaba BABA affiliate Ant Group to set up financial holding firm to ensure operations are under regulatory supervision.\n* Acadia Pharma ACAD target raised by Cantor Fitzgerald from $61 to $70. Stock currently around $53.70.\n* Intra-Cellular Therapies ITCI target raised by Cantor Fitsgerald from $53 to $54 at OVERWEIGHT. Stock currently around $31\n* Pfizer PFE target set by Royal Bank of Canada at 42 with OVERWEIGHT rating. Stock currently around 37.\n* BioHaven Pharma BHVN target raised by Cantor Fitzgerald from $109 to $115 at OVERWEIGHT. Stock currently around $86.50.\n* Wells Fargo WFC price target raised by Raymond James from $32 to $35 at OUTPERFORM. Stock currently around $30.\n* Beam Global BEEM target raised by Maxim Group from $45 to $90 at BUY. Stock currently around $66.50.\n* Equilibrium EQ on a tear, up over 40% for the day\n* Some nice movers today; PDD up 17%, XPEV up 9%, BABA up 6.5%, LI 6%, INTC up 5.5%, SNAP up 5%, LMND up 11%.\n\n\u201cLuck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.\u201d - Seneca",

        "selftext": "Brought to you by the retard who made $3 million off NVAX (look at my profile). I recently sold the majority of my NVAX shares and dumped all of that money into LAZR. \n\nFor those who don\u2019t know LAZR is a company specializing in producing LiDAR technology for self-driving cars as opposed to the current standard model of cameras. LiDAR instead sends out a beams of laser light, and measures the return time as well as wavelength distortions in order to create an image of the landscape. \n\nEVEN ELON MUSK IS SCARED OF THIS TECHNOLOGY. He has actively responded to and denounced it, and I believe in doing so has made it clear that he sees it as a threat.\n\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2019/04/22/anyone-relying-on-lidar-is-doomed-elon-musk-says/\n\nLuminar has contracts with several car companies. It is supplying Volkswagen and Volvo with these sensors, with the first Audi vehicles (owned by VW) equipped with these sensors coming out in 2021 and Volvo in 22. They also have Daimler and Toyota.\n\nhttps://www.media.volvocars.com/us/en-us/media/pressreleases/268323/next-generation-volvo-cars-to-be-powered-by-luminar-lidar-technology-for-safe-self-driving\n\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/vw-audi-aid-luminar-lidar-self-driving/\n\nhttps://www.autonews.com/mobility-report/daimler-invests-lidar-startup-luminar-bolster-self-driving-truck-effort\n\nhttps://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170927005431/en/Toyota-Research-Institute-Partners-with-Luminar-on-Autonomous-Vehicle-Tech\n\nIt is also supplying Mobileye (a subsidiary of Intel) with sensors. Mobileye has a partnership with NIO to produce self-driving passenger cars in China:\n\nhttps://newsroom.intel.com/news/mobileye-nio-partner-bring-level-4-autonomous-vehicles-consumers-china-beyond/\n\n\nIf you are bullish on any of the (Chinese) self-driving car stocks such as NIO, XPEV, etc. you should be bullish on this stock and LiDAR in general as they are using this exact technology in their vehicles.\n\nhttps://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-nio-autonomous-intel-idUKKBN1XG2H3\n\n\nWHY LAZR OVER OTHER LiDAR stocks?\n\nOne reason I chose this stock was mainly because of the big dick youngest billionaire 25 year old CEO. Before you laugh let me explain. This kid is a genius. He dropped out of Stanford because he received a 100,000 grant to pursue this company. From who? Our favorite: Peter Thiel. He has since been backing this company and I know how much you retards love this guy. This guy himself literally invented a brand new microchip for his technology because the commercially available ones weren\u2019t good enough. \n\nBuy the dip ASAP. It fell 20% today, consolidating from its massive 300% gain that it\u2019s had the past three weeks following the SPAC deal. It is still up 120% since three weeks ago. As of writing this I cannot tell you when this reversal will start (hence I am long in shares), but once this starts going back up I doubt we will ever see numbers this low again. It is almost half its current value since 1 week ago, this stock is a steal at its current price. This is an incredible long term investment and will only skyrocket in the foreseeable next couple years during the Electric Vehicle takeover.\n\nTLDR: Buy Peter Thiel backed company LAZR. It is at a huge discount rn and there may not be a better buying opportunity. It easily has the best technology compared to its competitors and already has contracts with Volvo, Volkswagen, Daimler, NIO, etc.",

        "selftext": "**Should you get into stocks that benefit from the booming housing market? Is the workout at home trade done? Intel stops the bleeding while Apple loses lawsuit. Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw all 3 big indexes closing the day in the red despite hitting intraday records, with the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/PCN8dwz) losing .38%, while both the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/cDjpNKP) and the [DOW JONES](https://ibb.co/RydQj61) Industrial finished the day down just over .2% as we also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/44wGzR0) rising by more than 4% yesterday as the $2000 stimulus was [BLOCKED](https://ibb.co/WFNSpCH) in the Senate by McConnell and the Georgia Senate runoff election is just a week away.\n\nAlmost 70% of the [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/LYM4JfL) were declining yesterday on below average volume as the number of companies that were trading above the 50-day moving average fell under 70% for the first time in quite a while.\n\nWe saw 9 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/GRJSmht) closing in the red yesterday, with only the Health Care and Consumer Discretionary sectors having small gains as almost all the types of companies were losing ground [YESTERDAY](https://ibb.co/7tKPyP4), especially the small-caps with the small-cap growth group losing more than 2%.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/KjVsn9X) from yesterday, it\u2019s mostly red, with only a couple of companies that were gaining big like the Chinese companies alongside Amazon and Intel.HEAT\n\nWe also got some economic data yesterday, as a review of the 2020 aviation and air travel [ESTIMATED](https://ibb.co/hRbYxpG) that traffic will be down 67% since last year, dropping to levels not seen since 1999, as air travel is still struggling to come back after the march bottoms. This has affected most of the [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/FBq4g37) worldwide but it seems that China airlines is doing somewhat better with the biggest percentage of the total number of flights completed compared to last year.\n\nThe SP Home price [INDICES](https://ibb.co/W67RBYh) also came in better than expected with the National Index increasing by 1.4% M/M, as this is a leading measure of real estate prices, gaining 8.4% nationwide over year ago.\n\nThese moves can also be seen in the latest Redfin report, as home sales [PRICES](https://ibb.co/CwR5H56) are up 14% year/year to over $320K with a great increase in pending [SALES](https://ibb.co/mJtrwV9) which are also up more than 34% since last year, as the number of active [LISTINGS](https://ibb.co/vVkfMMh) of home sales is down more than 30%, as buyers can\u2019t snatch them up quick enough with such low [YIELDS](https://ibb.co/7j1kY3s), as this has led for the [AVERAGE](https://ibb.co/gzQq8Wb) sale price to list value to rise to 99.4% which Is up 1.5% since 2019. This should be good news for companies like Toll Brothers, Lennar, HD and LOW.\n\nThis was also accompanied by the great numbers in the us chain store sales [NUMBERS](https://ibb.co/4PykPcH), which rose by almost 9% y/y with December sales expected to rise almost 5% since last year and a .2% increase since last month.\n\nWhile [TODAY](https://ibb.co/8N3YMPV) we start the day with MBA Mortgage applications, home sales and the Chicago PMI alongside advance reads on many other data points.\n\nIn some other stock market [NEWS](https://ibb.co/q1J6Snv), we saw Apple cool of a little yesterday, losing more than 1% for the day while they also lost a lawsuit aimed of stopping Corellium using virtual iPhone for security researching in the operating system, while [INTEL](https://ibb.co/3vvXFGT) finally got a breather and recovered some of the recent loses, after an activist hedge fund manager pushed for strategic changes in the company as Intel is losing market share and top designers, with the company also [ISSUING](https://ibb.co/WgtwTrY) a statement that lifted spirits around the stock.\n\nWe also saw the [FAA](https://ibb.co/6rJ6bHd) introduce new rules for drones, this may have a big impact on companies like UPS, Walmart and Amazon, as all of them have started trials for drone-delivery, as this could lead to better margins for the companies.\n\nThe Fed also [EXTENDED](https://ibb.co/cxV3HkC) the main street lending programs until Jan. 8 with the approval of Mnuchin as they try to process a bunch of applications this month, this means we can get even more money put into the economy and eventually the stock markets which is good news.\n\nAnd meanwhile, AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine was [APPROVED](https://ibb.co/y5QWbmh) for emergency use in the UK, this is another weapon to find this freaking illness, while JNJ will give us some results in early 2021 and Novavax just started their trial in the US.\n\nAlso, one last piece of data that I found recently shows that there was indeed a huge spike this [YEAR](https://ibb.co/JrKw01B) in the move to live streaming video and pre-recorded videos this year, as this has boosted companies like Peloton, Lululemon and others.\n\nBut this trend is seen slowing down in the next years with just a 4% [CAGR](https://ibb.co/HGhFJXS) in the equipment market, but that the exercise apps will see a big [GROWTH](https://ibb.co/02wm273) in the next years, so there are 2 different POV. I wouldn\u2019t stay invested in companies like PTON right now, I\u2019d rather take profits and move to other areas in the stock market. But don\u2019t rush into companies like AMC which have diluted their stock a lot or have lots of debt\u2026 this will not recover so fast, with [AMC](https://ibb.co/gDR8S81) filling to share up to 50M shares.\n\nLet\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/nbV49Bs) seem to be pointing at a good open, with all 3 big indexes in the green as the Nasdaq is leading the way.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "#1) Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 ETF (QQQJ)\n\nThe Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 ETF (QQQJ) follows the immensely well known Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) by investing in the 101st to the 200th largest NASDAQ listed companies. These companies are less mature than those in the NASDAQ 100 but with high growth potential.\n\nThe top holdings of QQQJ include Roku Inc (ROKU), Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (CRWD), The Trade Desk Inc (TTD), Zscaler Inc (ZS), Enphase Energy Inc (ENPH), AstraZeneca PLC (AZN), Take-Two Interactive Software Inc (TTWO), Old Dominion Freight Line Inc (ODFL), Fortinet Inc (FTNT), and Coupa Software Inc (COUP). Many of the most popular growth companies are included in this new ETF.\n\n#2) VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH)\n\nThe VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF tracks the semiconductor industry--one of the hottest industries of 2020. It isn\u2019t hard to be bullish on semiconductors when they are required by virtually all companies. Electric vehicles have put the spotlight on many semiconductor companies in the race for autonomous driving.\n\nThe VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) has top holdings including: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), Nvidia Corp (NVDA), ASML Holding (ASML), Broadcom Inc (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD), Texas Instruments Inc (TXN), Intel Corp (INTC), Qualcomm Inc (QCOM), Micron Technology Inc (MU), and Analog Devices Inc (ADI). Semiconductors have had a killer year and the outperformance will likely continue in the future as demand for semiconductors increases.\n\n#3) Salesforce.com, Inc (CRM)\n\nSalesforce.com, Inc (CRM) develops cloud computing solutions for customer relationship management (hence the ticker \u201cCRM\u201d). Salesforce recently announced it was acquiring Slack Technologies (WORK) for over $27 billion. This deal was one of the largest acquisitions announced in 2020. Salesforce has fallen almost 15% since the acquisition announcement on fears it is overpaying in the Slack acquisition.\n\nHowever, Salesforce has continued to crush earnings estimates in the last quarters of 2020 with analyst consensus that this growth can continue. Salesforce operates in a growing market and continues to be the number one choice for customer relationship management.\n\n#4) Array Technologies, Inc. (ARRY)\n\nArray Technologies, Inc. (ARRY) is in the business of solar tracking solutions and services. The Company currently provides the DuraTrack solar tracking system and SmarTrack which is software that automatically adjusts module angles to compensate for environment changes.\n\nArray is quickly growing revenues with earnings and free cash flow remaining positive since 2019. The Company has stated its plans for continued growth and its willingness to make acquisitions. Array Technologies is a direct bet on the future of solar energy which will likely benefit under a democratic Whitehouse. This Company allows investors to invest in the future of solar without investing directly into solar panels.\n\n#5) Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX)\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX) focuses on the treatment of cystic fibrosis through several drugs and has several ongoing clinical trials for the treatment of other diseases. Vertex collaborates with an impressive list of companies, including CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP), Moderna (MRNA), and Merck &amp; Co. (MRK).\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals has proven itself to be competent in developing market-leading drugs and securing lengthy patents on its treatments. The Company will continue to dominate the cystic fibrosis space in the future due to limited competition.\n\n**Honorable mentions:** CSIQ, AMZN, MSFT, PENN, ABBV, AZN, FUSE\n\n----\n\n**Note:** I hold positions in all of the mentioned companies and exchange traded funds. Many of these companies are valued at high multiples due to their growth potential. This is not financial advice; invest at your own risk.",

        "selftext": "**Stocks have a mixed day as Biden has his first full day in office. Traditional energy stocks lose some ground as we continue to see a transition to Green Energy. Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news!**\n\n**\\~Long post\\~**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw a mixed day, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/RbB5Xhz) leading the way, finishing .55% up and closing at a new all-time high just like the [SP500](https://ibb.co/X5v19R6) which barely finished the day in the green, while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/Gtq5WF7) industrial lost 12 points. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/Mpbp84k) continuing to lose ground, but at a lower rate, as it is testing the 21 levels yet again.\n\nAlmost 60% of the companies were declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/6rnhSpQ) on below average volume, as the companies trading above the moving averages is still very high. Yesterday we also saw only 3 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/2ZbYCWp) finish in the green with Tech leading the way up over 1%, while the biggest laggard by far was the Energy sector, losing over 3% for the day, as Large-cap growth companies were the only ones to gain [yesterday](https://ibb.co/yQNzN5b), while value plays lagged behind.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/y626Sdj) from yesterday. We can see Apple had a terrific day ahead of earnings, with most of the semis also joining in the rally, while the value heavy sectors like banks, materials and utilities joined Energy in underperforming for the day.\n\nYesterday we also received the investor sentiment [survey](https://ibb.co/QFsMCkj) which revealed a further decrease in bullish investors, which is music to my ears, as bearish investors saw another increase of 3%. I really hope we can get the bullish sentiment down under 38% so we can find better opportunities in the markets.\n\nWe also received other economic data yesterday, as the jobless [claims](https://ibb.co/tPmQGkd) came in 26k below last week and in-line with expectations, while continuing claims were also down over 100k to 5.05M, as we also saw the Philly [FED](https://ibb.co/YpQSMj4) coming in way better than expected while the December Housing [Starts](https://ibb.co/H7cPXfx) also came in ahead of expectations with a 5.8% increase m/m, as it doesn\u2019t seem the housing market will cool itself soon, it just wants to go higher &amp; higher right now.\n\nAnd one last number that we saw yesterday was from [Store](https://ibb.co/TTGMFCv) Capital which announced rent collections for January standing at 91%, a 1% increase since December. This is better than I expected, as I thought they would start to have more problems, with more restriction &amp; lockdowns happening in the cold season rather than improving the situation.\n\n[Today](https://ibb.co/BTQDPvt) we start the day off with the PMI reading and finish mostly with energy related economic data.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw most of the solar [stocks](https://ibb.co/WWKvsmz) and the other green energy stocks pop yesterday after Biden signed the executive order to rejoin the climate accord and also signed a number of other orders focused on moving to a greener energy. I think this will remain a very investable theme in the next couple of years, especially if the Dems keep the control of the Congress in the next elections.\n\nThis sector also contains [Tesla](https://ibb.co/0sQv2th) which according to the most recent data saw a 63% increase y/y in vehicle registration in California, which is another good sign for the company, as they are working towards building into this high valuation, while others like [Lucid](https://ibb.co/8s42vV5) Motors are still working into getting their first production car to the market.\n\nI think this highly flying stocks and IPOs should be taken with a lot of attention, yes, they are very interesting, but not all of them will make it to the other side (meaning the profit side), just like not all dot com companies made it. Invest wisely and diversify your portfolio to avoid significant risk.\n\nYesterday we also saw [Intel](https://ibb.co/vvXfTqz) beat expectations, with a beat of 40 cents on earnings and a beat of $2.5B on revenues, but did not impress with anything else, as the guidance still disappointed investors. This was the last quarter for the outgoing CEO which will be replaced in the next weeks, in a try to reimagine Intel\u2019s path forward. The company also increased their [dividend](https://ibb.co/0DfsfnX) by 5%, probably in an attempt to keep investors motivated to hold the stock. I think Intel might eventually catch-up to their competitors somewhat, but it will take a lot of spending and time. I think you are better off investing in others like Broadcom, AMD, Micron which seem to have a plan figured out already.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a turnaround in the markets or hopefully we only see a small healthy correction as the Asia-Pacific [markets](https://ibb.co/3NQmSck) fell overnight, with the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/mNq0Cy7) also posting to a red open.\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

Short interest is defined as \u201cThe number of shares of a security that have been sold short by investors.

Many of the most popular growth companies are included in this new ETF.\n\n#2) VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH)\n\nThe VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF tracks the semiconductor industry--one of the hottest industries of 2020. It isn\u2019t hard to be bullish on semiconductors when they are required by virtually all companies. Electric vehicles have put the spotlight on many semiconductor companies in the race for autonomous driving.\n\nThe VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) has top holdings including: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), Nvidia Corp (NVDA), ASML Holding (ASML), Broadcom Inc (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD), Texas Instruments Inc (TXN), Intel Corp (INTC), Qualcomm Inc (QCOM), Micron Technology Inc (MU), and Analog Devices Inc (ADI). Semiconductors have had a killer year and the outperformance will likely continue in the future as demand for semiconductors increases.\n\n#3) Salesforce.com, Inc (CRM)\n\nSalesforce.com, Inc (CRM) develops cloud computing solutions for customer relationship management (hence the ticker \u201cCRM\u201d). Salesforce recently announced it was acquiring Slack Technologies (WORK) for over $27 billion. This deal was one of the largest acquisitions announced in 2020. Salesforce has fallen almost 15% since the acquisition announcement on fears it is overpaying in the Slack acquisition.\n\nHowever, Salesforce has continued to crush earnings estimates in the last quarters of 2020 with analyst consensus that this growth can continue. Salesforce operates in a growing market and continues to be the number one choice for customer relationship management.\n\n#4) Array Technologies, Inc. (ARRY)\n\nArray Technologies, Inc. (ARRY) is in the business of solar tracking solutions and services. The Company currently provides the DuraTrack solar tracking system and SmarTrack which is software that automatically adjusts module angles to compensate for environment changes.\n\nArray is quickly growing revenues with earnings and free cash flow remaining positive since 2019. The Company has stated its plans for continued growth and its willingness to make acquisitions. Array Technologies is a direct bet on the future of solar energy which will likely benefit under a democratic Whitehouse. This Company allows investors to invest in the future of solar without investing directly into solar panels.\n\n#5) Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX)\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX) focuses on the treatment of cystic fibrosis through several drugs and has several ongoing clinical trials for the treatment of other diseases. Vertex collaborates with an impressive list of companies, including CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP), Moderna (MRNA), and Merck &amp; Co. (MRK).\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals has proven itself to be competent in developing market-leading drugs and securing lengthy patents on its treatments. The Company will continue to dominate the cystic fibrosis space in the future due to limited competition.\n\n**Honorable mentions:** CSIQ, AMZN, MSFT, PENN, ABBV, AZN, FUSE\n\n----\n\n**Note:** I hold positions in all of the mentioned companies and exchange traded funds. Many of these companies are valued at high multiples due to their growth potential. This is not financial advice; invest at your own risk.",

Still, considering rivals like qcom, mu, avgo, and tsmc, Marvell's in it's infancy with a market cap one-third the size of the smallest of the others I listed. \n\nbroadcom, for example, seems to be focusing on 5G rollout as one of their bigger growth streams, and Marvell is doing the same. Assuming they both see comparable revenue from exposure to that industry, shouldn't that result in a larger % of growth overall for marvell?\n\nOr, is there a reason to think that the already established competitors will be able to keep marvell's growth locked down due to their already substantial market share in most existing markets?",

Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news!**\n\n**\\~Long post\\~**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw a mixed day, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/RbB5Xhz) leading the way, finishing .55% up and closing at a new all-time high just like the [SP500](https://ibb.co/X5v19R6) which barely finished the day in the green, while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/Gtq5WF7) industrial lost 12 points. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/Mpbp84k) continuing to drop, but at a lower rate, as it is testing the 21 levels yet again.\n\nAlmost 60% of the companies were declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/6rnhSpQ) on below average volume, as the companies trading above the moving averages is still very high. Yesterday we also saw only 3 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/2ZbYCWp) finish in the green with Tech leading the way up over 1%, while the biggest laggard by far was the Energy sector, dropping over 3% for the day, as Large-cap growth companies were the only ones to gain [yesterday](https://ibb.co/yQNzN5b), while value plays lagged behind.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/y626Sdj) from yesterday. We can see Apple had a terrific day ahead of earnings, with most of the semis also joining in the rally, while the value heavy sectors like banks, materials and utilities joined Energy in underperforming for the day.\n\nYesterday we also received the investor sentiment [survey](https://ibb.co/QFsMCkj) which revealed a further drop in bullish investors, which is music to my ears, as bearish investors saw another increase of 3%. I really hope we can get the bullish sentiment down under 38% so we can find better opportunities in the markets.\n\nWe also received other economic data yesterday, as the jobless [claims](https://ibb.co/tPmQGkd) came in 26k below last week and in-line with expectations, while continuing claims were also down over 100k to 5.05M, as we also saw the Philly [FED](https://ibb.co/YpQSMj4) coming in way better than expected while the December Housing [Starts](https://ibb.co/H7cPXfx) also came in ahead of expectations with a 5.8% increase m/m, as it doesn\u2019t seem the housing market will cool itself soon, it just wants to go higher &amp; higher right now.\n\nAnd one last number that we saw yesterday was from [Store](https://ibb.co/TTGMFCv) Capital which announced rent collections for January standing at 91%, a 1% increase since December. This is better than I expected, as I thought they would start to have more problems, with more restriction &amp; lockdowns happening in the cold season rather than improving the situation.\n\n[Today](https://ibb.co/BTQDPvt) we start the day off with the PMI reading and finish mostly with energy related economic data.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw most of the solar [stocks](https://ibb.co/WWKvsmz) and the other green energy stocks pop yesterday after Biden signed the executive order to rejoin the climate accord and also signed a number of other orders focused on moving to a greener energy. I think this will remain a very investable theme in the next couple of years, especially if the Dems keep the control of the Congress in the next elections.\n\nThis sector also contains [Tesla](https://ibb.co/0sQv2th) which according to the most recent data saw a 63% increase y/y in vehicle registration in California, which is another good sign for the company, as they are working towards building into this high valuation, while others like [Lucid](https://ibb.co/8s42vV5) Motors are still working into getting their first production car to the market and \u201creportedly\u201d entering a SPAC deal with CCIV.\n\nI think this SPACS and IPOs should be taken with a lot of attention, yes, they are very interesting, but not all of them will make it to the other side (meaning the profit side), just like not all dot com companies made it. Invest wisely and diversify your portfolio to avoid significant risk.\n\nYesterday we also saw [Intel](https://ibb.co/vvXfTqz) beat expectations, with a beat of 40 cents on earnings and a beat of $2.5B on revenues, but did not impress with anything else, as the guidance still disappointed investors. This was the last quarter for the outgoing CEO which will be replaced in the next weeks, in a try to reimagine Intel\u2019s path forward. The company also increased their [dividend](https://ibb.co/0DfsfnX) by 5%, probably in an attempt to keep investors motivated to hold the stock. I think Intel might eventually catch-up to their competitors somewhat, but it will take a lot of spending and time. I think you are better off investing in others like Broadcom, AMD, Micron which seem to have a plan figured out already.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a turnaround in the markets or hopefully we only see a small healthy correction as the Asia-Pacific [markets](https://ibb.co/3NQmSck) fell overnight, with the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/mNq0Cy7) also posting to a red open.\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

Electric vehicles have put the spotlight on many semiconductor companies in the race for autonomous driving.\n\nThe VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) has top holdings including: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), Nvidia Corp (NVDA), ASML Holding (ASML), Broadcom Inc (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD), Texas Instruments Inc (TXN), Intel Corp (INTC), Qualcomm Inc (QCOM), Micron Technology Inc (MU), and Analog Devices Inc (ADI). Semiconductors have had a killer year and the outperformance will likely continue in the future as demand for semiconductors increases.\n\n#3) Salesforce.com, Inc (CRM)\n\nSalesforce.com, Inc (CRM) develops cloud computing solutions for customer relationship management (hence the ticker \u201cCRM\u201d). Salesforce recently announced it was acquiring Slack Technologies (WORK) for over $27 billion. This deal was one of the largest acquisitions announced in 2020. Salesforce has fallen almost 15% since the acquisition announcement on fears it is overpaying in the Slack acquisition.\n\nHowever, Salesforce has continued to crush earnings estimates in the last quarters of 2020 with analyst consensus that this growth can continue. Salesforce operates in a growing market and continues to be the number one choice for customer relationship management.\n\n#4) Array Technologies, Inc. (ARRY)\n\nArray Technologies, Inc. (ARRY) is in the business of solar tracking solutions and services. The Company currently provides the DuraTrack solar tracking system and SmarTrack which is software that automatically adjusts module angles to compensate for environment changes.\n\nArray is quickly growing revenues with earnings and free cash flow remaining positive since 2019. The Company has stated its plans for continued growth and its willingness to make acquisitions. Array Technologies is a direct bet on the future of solar energy which will likely benefit under a democratic Whitehouse. This Company allows investors to invest in the future of solar without investing directly into solar panels.\n\n#5) Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX)\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX) focuses on the treatment of cystic fibrosis through several drugs and has several ongoing clinical trials for the treatment of other diseases. Vertex collaborates with an impressive list of companies, including CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP), Moderna (MRNA), and Merck &amp; Co. (MRK).\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals has proven itself to be competent in developing market-leading drugs and securing lengthy patents on its treatments. The Company will continue to dominate the cystic fibrosis space in the future due to limited competition.\n\n**Honorable mentions:** CSIQ, AMZN, MSFT, PENN, ABBV, AZN, FUSE\n\n----\n\n**Note:** I hold positions in all of the mentioned companies and exchange traded funds. Many of these companies are valued at high multiples due to their growth potential. This is not financial advice; invest at your own risk.",

        "selftext": "I'm not saying we *should* be that excited about this company- I am pathetic at DD, so I'm hoping to get some guidance about where my attention should be focused to make sense of what I'm perceiving as a discrepancy.\n\nSemiconductors blew up last year, and Marvell certainly benefitted from that. Still, considering rivals like qcom, mu, avgo, and tsmc, Marvell's in it's infancy with a market cap one-third the size of the smallest of the others I listed. \n\nbroadcom, for example, seems to be focusing on 5G rollout as one of their bigger growth streams, and Marvell is doing the same. Assuming they both see comparable revenue from exposure to that industry, shouldn't that result in a larger % of growth overall for marvell?\n\nOr, is there a reason to think that the already established competitors will be able to keep marvell's growth locked down due to their already substantial market share in most existing markets?",
