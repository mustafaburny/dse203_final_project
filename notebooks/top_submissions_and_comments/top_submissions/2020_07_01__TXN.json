        "selftext": "A decade and a half ago I made a decent living learning to read the tape at a prop shop. While many of my fellow trading desk autists traded lame shit like Twix and Pfft, or rebate traded attain (ATTN ECN) crosses with under $5 NASDAQ stocks (JDSU), I traded shit that actually moved during the day with actual volume. I'm talking the top volume movers of the Big Board back in the day. Texas/TI(TXN), Head(HD), the mouse(DIS), Whammy(WMT) and that good'le pussy(CAT). We were a colorful bunch (and yes, we called our bitches that).\n\nEvery once in a while the squawkbox would get loud and I knew it was time to get me some handles on the e-minis following paper. When paper trades, you draft it's wake which ever way it's going while you make some tendies. If paper's got 250 at 80, you fucking pound the 75 bid on the minis until you run out of buying power.\n\nAnyways, started lurking here about a month or two ago. After seeing so many retarded TSLA gains, I sold some boring shit I was holding last week to have some cash in my account. Decided to spend Friday just seeing if the tape could still be read despite the algos taking over. Figured I'd try TSLA, just like the rest of you retards.\n\nSo I got ready to trade this morning, saw the crazy gap up premarket, figured paper was going to let this run as close to 18-even as they could get away with while letting FOMO retards fill their shorts. My plan was simple, trade the closing of the gap after paper showed its hand. Bought my 7/17 puts around 1770 after they hammered down the spike to 1794, i.e. the tape read that paper was saying \"So long retards, and thanks for all the fish!!!\": 4x1500p @ 16.9 (the low printed 15), 1600p @ 39.4 (low 33) and 1650p @ 57.9 (low \\~47). Almost the full cash balance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n94z39ckapa51.png?width=772&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d988becf46031ac6b80ad462d0d9200ebf4a63f8\n\nSold the 1650 for enough to cover my position during the first break of 1550. Holding the rest (\\~50K unrealized) to see a test of 1400 tomorrow (because that's the tale of the tape).\n\nYou retards need to stop chasing your trades and learn to understand what the tape is yelling at you so you don't end up bagholding nor paperhanding shit.",

        "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # WSB Learns Ch 3: The Cloud Environment (Draft)\n\n# # About Me\n\nI'm a Mexican American software engineer in the fintech industry (US) and avocado farmer (Mexico).  I have 8 years working in a manufacturing, fintech, and education policy. My economic research and model largely revolves around increasing Mexican-American trade after USMCA changes and I write around organizations that will be affected by Mexican development and American innovation. I write extensively because I love to teach online, debate, and learn a few things myself in the process.\n\n* Digital Transactions\n* Cybersecurity\n* Cross-border Trade\n* Agricultural Technology\n* Manufacturing support\n* Labor laws &amp; IP/data protection\n\nSome of these picks are abundantly clear. For example:\n\n1. Nucor Steel will see operations grow\n2. Kansas City Southern Rail is a critical supply chain element\n3. Paypal and Square will continue to build financial services in underbanked nations like Mexico.\n4. Cloudflare will offer unbelievably inexpensive cybersecurity and networking support\n5. Texas Instruments will build advanced manufacturing technology based on computer vision\n6. **Dropbox will continue to expand tooling in academia, camera and signature solutions, and data storage in an era of advanced data collection &amp; computing.**\n7. Institutions and financieers are investing in logistics and data center real estate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# DBX 24-26c 8/21\n\n# DBX 24c 9/18\n\n[https://assets-global.website-files.com/580ea75512564ed05c3a8455/5bfc62c5aca97fa17998085e\\_dropbox-blog-image-1434x590.jpg](https://assets-global.website-files.com/580ea75512564ed05c3a8455/5bfc62c5aca97fa17998085e_dropbox-blog-image-1434x590.jpg)\n\n# # My Belief\n\n**Dropbox is in the right place at the right time, much like a recycled cardboard boxing company is in logistics.** Cloud computing is complex and Big Tech will antitrust and decoupling pressures as time goes on. These companies are not stupid and are able to survive the change by decentralizing and consolidating over time. Telecom, oil, and other industries have done this in the past. However, this is probably the weakest factor in Dropbox's position.\n\nThe simple truth is that the marketshare of files and file processing is fucking huge and it's possible to grow at a respectable rate despite the fact that iCloud, Google Drive, and AWS S3 exists.  There are banking, manufacturing, and other data processors that require this shit and it's the same reason you're seeing organizations like ZScaler grow.\n\n* Adobe has a strong grasp on video, animated, and drawn files\n* Dropbox blessed legions of academics with window-mac file problems\n* Microsoft has made an enormous change by acquiring software engineering files via Github and NPM, which leverages them further into software automation with Softomotive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;*We focus particularly on the use cases that are complementary. And we see ourselves as playing an important role in terms of taking a couple steps back and making sure the overall experience is coherent. More than we're trying to engage in a dogfight with any particular tool or facet of the experience.* \\- Dropbox CEO\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oodnkwv4q5c51.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd6c45b7abd0d7db7b89d6540896cb40e218abd0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6aqbxas5q5c51.jpg?width=2716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da9655de09d81bba1c11d14a6b71a7b94b05c591\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pinsndv6q5c51.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1d162b2f7b72a356b86a8ed6be5365c21a0de83\n\nI actually view Dropbox closer to Adobe and DocuSign, but much more of a longterm cloud infrastructure layer rather than a sexy app that enhances the experience of using devices like iPad Pros and such.\n\nYou can do a lot of cool shit with files and I'm sure that the leadership behind DropBox is highly cognizant of the possibilities behind legal software, contract security, signature software, transactions, and other critical supply chain elements like academic management, IT support, and a financially robust competitor that institutions are happy to purchase stake in. This is file tooling and it's a big fucking industry that will be empowered by AI, computer vision, data processing, and the real estate of large data centers.\n\nIm making this over simplified, but the IT world is structured in layers. This extends from your router to your internet provider's telecommunication. You can imagine that organizations like Cloudflare &amp; Dropbox exist in separate layers under the same idea.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p8np7stlg5c51.png?width=3518&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc38df1402a4220c8beccdeb3d467bf27847b3e9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8tso1caia5c51.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98513757632de2d7900842a2ace2951be58c7360\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2401iz3oa5c51.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a697cbc38f89c84c7150c7fc8102778a6f3bb14\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p47zwp8os5c51.png?width=1047&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=486885d26d0b1122738df569e2accae89bc5ce22\n\n# # Why Dropbox?\n\nIn short, DropBox is wildly popular among\n\n\\- Academics\n\n\\- Accountants\n\n\\- HR teams\n\n\\- Deep Technology relationships over the past decade (early Spotify, startups, app integrations)\n\n\\- Anyone that has to deal with a fuck ton of files all of the time.\n\nDropbox is very similar to Cloudflare. It has taken years of careful development, relationship building, and investor confidence before going public on a highly distributed, robust, and cost effective technology for both Enterprise and SMB level users. They are technologists that know how to build a business.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ik5t8m7h65c51.png?width=1247&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4e2d7fa558823f75e4cf80dfaa295eebdbe83ba\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Dropbox Marketshare in Mexico](https://preview.redd.it/riv24qhq65c51.png?width=2989&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2df4b27406cbf8863e1eeabd1a2676d7c510740d)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[2019 - Dropbox acquires HelloSign &amp; HelloWorks to manage legal contracts, signatures, and business needs.](https://preview.redd.it/2a05uwk385c51.png?width=729&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41db97e6bad427fe7d6428ea36e6a7ff81798095)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[DropBox is known for being financially consistent. ](https://preview.redd.it/v7hreqc985c51.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8dbd9e369864b58c618640dc83f2b7b817c81f54)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# ",

It's a rapidly growing product that I believe will protect interests as Latin America develops. I believe that their development of privacy-focused serverless computing and video streaming infrastructure was what was necessary for it to experience enormous growth in the next few years.\n\n [https://blog.cloudflare.com/scaling-the-cloudflare-global/](https://blog.cloudflare.com/scaling-the-cloudflare-global/) \n\n\\- **Corteva - AGRICULTURE BIOTECH**\n\nCorteva is a powerfully focused agritech investment. They have deep investments in corn, which is an enormous product that will always persist in Mexico and US agriculture.\n\n [https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/united-states-mexico-canada-agreement/fact-sheets/strengthening](https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/united-states-mexico-canada-agreement/fact-sheets/strengthening) \n\n\\- **Facebook - E-COMMERCE**\n\nI believe Facebook will play a really interesting role with Canada's Shopify in Latin America. WhatsApp is enormously popular in Mexico due to Facebook's networking investments, making it cheap to use. WhatsApp is better suited for Mexico's barter style economy, while Instagram seems to serve America's ad-centric transactions better. I believe we will be seeing Facebook develop deep business support with Shopify that is easy to use for billions of people across different economies.  Some of the technology is actually faschinating, as you can purchase products and test products using filters and 1-swipe purchases.\n\n [https://www.facebook.com/business/shops](https://www.facebook.com/business/shops) \n\n**- Kansas City Southern - US-MEXICAN RAIL**\n\nKansas City Southern is an extremely important trade vector between Mexico and the US. In particular, Texas and Monterrey. It's well diversified to deliver at a cost effective rate between changes in agriculture, energy, automotive, machining, food, and more.\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/54480/000005448016000143/wf\\_colorkcssystemmap2015a01.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/54480/000005448016000143/wf_colorkcssystemmap2015a01.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Adobe - GRAPHICS**\n\nI'm completely impressed by Adobe's growth and acquisitions across multiple sectors. I believe Adobe is a great longterm AR play as it maintains a close relationship with Apple, develops software for video games, movies, digital signatures, and e-commerce, architecture, design, and an endless array of other software solutions.\n\n [https://theblog.adobe.com/adobe-acquires-allegorithmic-substance-3d-gaming/](https://theblog.adobe.com/adobe-acquires-allegorithmic-substance-3d-gaming/) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Paypal - FINANCIAL ACCESS**\n\nPaypal is interesting in regards to US-Mexico.Paypal has always demonstrated itself as a pioneer. It's very easy to send remittance money through Xoom. It's easy to send money to your friends via Venmo. Their credit system is awfully fair, which is helpful in a nation like Mexico that's critically underbanked. \n\nThey also had an excellent acquisition with Honey. I believe they'll be generating billions through their transactions on Amazon and other industries and will force fintech to rethink how far financial technology can go.\n\n [https://www.zdnet.com/article/paypal-acquires-honey-science-for-4-billion-adds-offers-deals-to-payment-network/#:\\~:text=Dan%20Schulman%2C%20CEO%20of%20PayPal,monthly%20active%20users%20in%20October.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/paypal-acquires-honey-science-for-4-billion-adds-offers-deals-to-payment-network/#:~:text=Dan%20Schulman%2C%20CEO%20of%20PayPal,monthly%20active%20users%20in%20October.) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Texas Instruments  - EMBEDDED SYSTEMS**\n\nI've selected for TI over AMD and Nvidia  since TI has a greater distribution. You'll find TI in automobiles, space rockets, airplanes, CNCs, school calculators, concrete producers, and so on.  Either way, AMD is listed below as a supplement to an already cloud-heavy setup.\n\n [https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/02/24/texas-instruments-incorporated-stock-in-4-charts.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/02/24/texas-instruments-incorporated-stock-in-4-charts.aspx) \n\n\\- **Teradyne - SYSTEMS TESTING &amp; INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION**\n\nTeradyne is part of the COVID restructure. I believe networking hardware chips are only  going to be more needed as an economic driver. Teradyne has an excellent client base regarding that and also develops and impressive amount of industrial automation robots across warehouses, farms, and so on. The future is inevitably automation, and this is my participation in that.\n\n [https://www.universal-robots.com/about-universal-robots/news-centre/teradyne-inc-acquires-universal-robots/](https://www.universal-robots.com/about-universal-robots/news-centre/teradyne-inc-acquires-universal-robots/) \n\n\\- **Microsoft - SOFTWARE AUTOMATION**\n\nI'm really excited to see Microsoft's future in software automation and services. They have a really interesting position with regards to gaming, cloud computing, and wonderful acquisitions for Github &amp; NPM and an array of other tools that can perform intensive software automation.\n\n [https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-acquires-softomotive-to-expand-low-code-robotic-process-automation-capabilities-in-microsoft-power-automate/](https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-acquires-softomotive-to-expand-low-code-robotic-process-automation-capabilities-in-microsoft-power-automate/) \n\n\\- **Costco - QUALITY CONSUMER GOODS**\n\nCostco has an excellent selection process that can be replicated across multiple cultures. The business pays their customers well which in turn results in supreme customer service and care.\n\n [https://futurefuel.io/employee-benefits/costco-careers/](https://futurefuel.io/employee-benefits/costco-careers/) \n\n\\- **Berkshire.B - QUALITY BUSINESSES**\n\nBerkshire.B is selected for similar reasons to Costco. I'm excited for Abel's leadership in the 21st century and they're simply an elegant long term investment with respects to quality business selection.\n\n [https://finance.yahoo.com/u/yahoo-finance/watchlists/the-berkshire-hathaway-portfolio](https://finance.yahoo.com/u/yahoo-finance/watchlists/the-berkshire-hathaway-portfolio) \n\n\\- **XLB Materials ETF - PROCESS ENGINEERING**\n\nXLB has an excellent selection of dominant businesses with respects to their industry like Sherwin-Williams, Linde PLC, and Ecolab.\n\n [https://www.sectorspdr.com/sectorspdr/sector/xlb/holdings](https://www.sectorspdr.com/sectorspdr/sector/xlb/holdings) \n\n\\- **Tesla - FUTURE MANUFACTURING**\n\nTesla is interesting as it develops robust applications and development of EV batteries, battery solutions, industrial automation and is helmed by a person who is able to mine engineering resources and relationships from SpaceX.\n\n [https://electrek.co/2020/06/17/tesla-new-deal-panasonic-battery-supply/](https://electrek.co/2020/06/17/tesla-new-deal-panasonic-battery-supply/) \n\n\\- **AMD - COMPUTING ACCESSIBILITY**\n\nI feel that the name of the game for AMD is the ability to reduce energy costs and low the cost of computing. They have been excelling at this for years now and I believe this patience will pay off enormously as AMD conquers the maintenance of data centers around the world.\n\n [https://blog.cloudflare.com/technical-details-of-why-cloudflare-chose-amd-epyc-for-gen-x-servers/](https://blog.cloudflare.com/technical-details-of-why-cloudflare-chose-amd-epyc-for-gen-x-servers/)",

But TL;DR AMD is cost effective as fucking hell, data centers are building out, and they want the best shit for the best price. AMD was there when they needed to be there.\n\n\\- **Facebook.** I believe that Facebook will begin to seriously highlight their progress and plans for e-commerce trade at the global stage in places like Brazil, Canada, US, Mexico, and India while discussing various other things like investments with Walmart, Shopify, and Rio. They will have many subjects to brief on like voter drives, advertiser damage, political and security measures to reconcile with investor attitudes.\n\n**- Dropbox.** I think people are sleeping on this. They have a strong hold on academia file management, excellent storage engineers that can anticipate data center changes, and HelloSign for business legal agreements and cross border requirements.\n\n\\- **Cloudflare.** I think they'll have a massive boost in revenue and a continued and more developed focus on how to profit from video infrastructure from companies like [JD.com](https://JD.com) and [Cloudflare.tv](https://Cloudflare.tv) . Privacy in China will be a long and hard fought battle and the future is inevitably e-commerce, video commerce, and the infrastructure required to make that competitive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# USMCA MEXICAN-AMERICAN TRADE AND INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n\\- **Kansas City Southern Rail** (Rail and cross border trade provisions)\n\n\\- **Corteva** (World first agritech provisions)\n\n\\- **Nucor Steel** (Infrastructure demand boost)\n\n\\- **Sempra Energy** (Energy provisions)\n\n\\- **Ford Automotive** (Automotive provisions)\n\n\\- **EWW ETF** (Mexican economy tracker)\n\n\\- **Crown Castle** (Telecom infrastructure)\n\n\\- **Texas Instruments** (General Computer Machining parts)  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# USMCA MEXICAN-AMERICAN TECH\n\n\\- Cloudflare (Cybersecurity provision)\n\n\\- Facebook (Digital Trade &amp; Data provisions)\n\n\\- Paypal (Digital trade provisions)\n\n\\- Dropbox (Legal agreement signatures and digital trade provisions)\n\n# You can doubt me but this is my record so far\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[30c NET June-August](https://preview.redd.it/7dwe3lwwy4b51.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0111e8d2a77849d3140b08ff07d6027faed1431c)\n\n[Facebook 220c 5\\/29 on 5\\/13](https://preview.redd.it/671ft1zzy4b51.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46175a52b16414d2e5e796f5efd999d548491fce)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Predicting USMCA x Infrastructure to bolster the economy](https://preview.redd.it/5gen3gdx15b51.png?width=1463&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec7eca2de2dd0140f8ffc3409bed4a78185415cc)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ee7hsy6cz4b51.png?width=1498&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a8a60d5fbbd4590d525aef6f9207eb07275b26a",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 20th, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings and fiscal debate could be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/17/earnings-and-fiscal-debate-could-be-catalysts-for-stocks-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Investors are braced for a barrage of earnings news, and the debate in Washington around the next stimulus package may also be an important catalyst for markets since it has implications for the economic recovery.\n*****\n&gt; Big tech names, including Microsoft, Intel, Twitter and IBM, are among companies reporting in the week ahead, as is high-flying Tesla. Blue chips Coca-Cola, Verizon, American Express and Travelers are also among the dozens of major companies releasing results.\n*****\n&gt; Congress returns from its break and should pick up the pace of negotiations towards a new fiscal stimulus package, which is expected to address aid for state and local governments and enhanced unemployment benefits. Unemployment benefits, including the $600 additional weekly payment now going to millions, is expected to be a hot topic of discussion, as the benefit ends on July 31.\n*****\n&gt; There are just a few items of note on the economic calendar, including existing home sales on Wednesday, unemployment claims data on Thursday and new home sales on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; The spread of the coronavirus will also be closely monitored, as well as any signs of medical progress. The Lancet medical journal is expected to release early stage human trial data Monday on a vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca.\n*****\n&gt; # \u2018Push and pull\u2019 in market\n&gt; Investors also will be watching the market\u2019s own dynamics in the week ahead. There is tension within the market between the bubbly run-up of tech and momentum names on the Nasdaq, and the broader market, or S&amp;P 500, which is basically still flat for the year. The Nasdaq is up 17% year to date, but in the past week lagged other indices, turning in a loss, while the Dow and S&amp;P 500 were both higher.\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq\u2019s outperformance came to an abrupt end Monday, and it has lagged since then. In dramatic fashion, the index rose sharply to new highs, with many big tech names and Tesla also hitting highs. Within the same session, there was a massive reversal in the index and in tech and momentum names, and they closed sharply lower.\n*****\n&gt; Now strategists are watching to see if the froth will be let out slowly or blow off in a big move that takes the rest of the market with it.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe expect the push and pull of the Nasdaq to continue and have sustained volatility, in our view, throughout the earnings season,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy at BTIG. \u201cVolatility could be to the upside, as well as the downside, but in our view, in aggregate, the Nasdaq is likely to correct.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said the volatile reversal in the Nasdaq does not bode well for the Nasdaq, and it could see a 10% correction. There\u2019s been a surge of retail activity in some of the frothiest names, such as Tesla, which surged from about $1,000 at the end of June to a high of $1,795 during Monday\u2019s session. It is since about $300 per share lower.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe combination of public participation and just incredible valuations makes the sector very, very vulnerable. ... It\u2019s the sector with the highest earnings expectations,\u201d said Emanuel. \u201cThere\u2019s virtually nothing that management can say at these valuations that\u2019s going to create further upside to these names.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Tesla and Microsoft report earnings Wednesday, and Twitter reports Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; # A bump up in stimulus\n&gt; As Congress heads back to Washington in the coming week, expectations are rising that the fiscal stimulus package could be slightly more than Republicans were previously expected to approve.\n*****\n&gt; When Congress broke for the July 4 holiday, there was a big divide on how much stimulus should be added, on top of the $2.4 trillion already adopted. The Democratic proposal was for $3 trillion, while Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said no more than $1 trillion. Now the gulf has narrowed, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the $1.3 trillion under discussions is not enough.\n*****\n&gt; Cornerstone Macro\u2019s Andy Laperriere said the package could now be $1.5 trillion or more, more than he expected just several weeks ago. He said more money is now expected for state and local governments, local schools, public health, virus testing and payments to support individuals..\n*****\n&gt; \u201cRepublicans really want to use this bill to encourage and incentivize businesses and schools to open. But I think the big thing is a month ago, the top priority of Republicans was to keep this bill small,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; One of the most controversial elements of the CARES stimulus package was the $600 weekly payment to people who were already collecting unemployment.\n*****\n&gt; The payment is likely to be significantly reduced and then ultimately phased out, but that will only come after compromise. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be some lines-in-the-sand issues, and this is one of them,\u201d said Laperriere, head of policy at Cornerstone.\n*****\n&gt; President Donald Trump has said he won\u2019t sign the bill unless there is a payroll tax cut, which was previously rejected by Congress. Payroll taxes are paid by both employers and employees, and they fund government programs, including Medicare and Social Security.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said the market could react to the deliberations if they take longer than expected, or the funds are viewed as insufficient.\n*****\n&gt; Michael Schumacher, Wells Fargo director of rate strategy, said the bond market will focus on how quickly the government plans to payout the stimulus and also the degree to which the Treasury will ultimately have to increase auction sizes to pay for it.\n*****\n&gt; If Congress keeps to its schedule, it needs to approve the package before the end of the month, when it heads to another recess for the entire month of August.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/X7dY3T7L/finvizmaps1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/v81m24Jp/alphatrends717202.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.postimg.cc/gcf2CYdr/finvizfuts1.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/FstWbdq4/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/YCx2LYFm/marketdata1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/q7MJsqcD/spxsectors1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/qM09hYxj/marketpullbacklevels1.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/v85JmMf4/marketrallylevels1.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/xTm8QYrx/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/QdgGnDxL/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/52WW3yJq/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/RVHzKfkZ/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Good and the Bad from Earnings This Week\n\n&gt; Earnings season began at the start of this week with Pepsi (PEP) and the first of the major US banks and brokers reporting Q2 numbers. It was a light week with only 32 companies reporting through Thursday, but in the coming weeks, we'll see 100+ reports on multiple trading days.\n\n&gt; From our Earnings Explorer tool, below is a recap of the results from this week's earnings reports. 78% of companies that reported this week beat consensus analyst EPS estimates, while 72% topped consensus sales estimates. Those are both strong numbers. In terms of future projections, 16% of companies raised guidance, and not one company lowered guidance. That's rare even with the very low number of reports so far.\n\n&gt; While guidance and beat rates were strong, investors still used earnings reports as an opportunity to sell. The average one-day share price change this week for companies in reaction to their earnings reports was a decline of 0.57%. All of those declines came on the initial gap down at the open, however. After averaging a gap down of 0.76% at the open of trading following the earnings release, the average stock that reported gained 0.21% from the open to the close. (The gap down of 0.76% and the open to close gain of 0.21% adds up to the full-day decline of 0.57% mentioned earlier.)\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/earnings.png))**\n\n&gt; Below is a table showing all 32 companies that reported Q2 numbers this week (through Thursday). The list is sorted by one-day share price reaction from best to worst. Alcoa (AA) had the best price reaction to earnings this week with a gain of 6.39% yesterday. WNS Global (WNS) put up the second-biggest gain at 6.36%. The next best-performing stocks in reaction to earnings this week only gained 3%+ -- USB and HOMB. Other stocks that reported this week that gained in response to their earnings reports include Morgan Stanley (MS), Goldman Sachs (GS), Taiwan Semi (TSM), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), and JP Morgan (JPM).\n\n&gt; On the downside, AngioDynamics (ANGO) saw the worst share price reaction to earnings this week when it fell 11.51% on Thursday. Sleep Number (SNBR) was second-worst with a one-day drop of 9.19% yesterday as well.\n\n&gt; While MS, GS, and JPM all posted gains in reaction to earnings this week, other banks like Citi (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Bank of America (BAC) reacted negatively with each falling 4% or more.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/companies.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Retail Sales Beat Again\n\n&gt; Retail sales data for June was reported on Thursday, handily beating expectations for the second consecutive month. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, June saw a 7.5% increase month over month, compared with Bloomberg\u2019s consensus expectations for a 5% gain. This comes on the heels of a more than 18% gain in May, but also following by far the lowest reading ever, a 14.7% decline in April.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.17.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Pent-up demand and the continued easing of lockdowns during June likely contributed to the large increase, which saw sales rise across most categories. Sales spiked 8.2% at auto dealers, but even sales excluding autos and gas rose 6.7%. Clothing store sales more than doubled (+105.1%) while sales in the hard-hit food services and drinking places climbed 20%.\n\n&gt; \u201cConsumer spending is still far below pre-pandemic levels and many of the real-time data we are monitoring have begun to level off in the past month,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWe remain encouraged by the strong rebound in May and June, but would expect more gradual gains for retail sales in the second half of the year.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n# Why A Potential Democrat Sweep May Not Be A Market Worry\n\n&gt; Based on the latest polling data, there\u2019s growing consensus that former Vice President Joe Biden potentially may win the election and Democrats possibly may sweep Congress. Some might think this could be a negative for stocks, as a higher corporate tax rate that reduces earnings could be part of the Democratic platform.\n\n&gt; Early writers of the US Constitution were worried about one party having too much power that could enable factions in Washington, DC, to enact more extreme policies and political ideals, upsetting the carefully balanced apple cart. As we noted in our recently released Midyear Outlook 2020, stocks historically have performed quite well when Congress has been split, although stocks actually have done better than most probably realized when the Democrats were in full control.\n\n&gt; \u201cHigher corporate taxes are quite likely should we see a potential Democratic sweep,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut to blindly say stocks will do poorly is quite a stretch, as historically stocks have done rather well under this .\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 Index has been higher 9 of the past 10 times and 15 of the past 18 times Democrats controlled both the White House and Congress. Although LPL Research anticipates a likely split Congress in November, with the list of overall worries growing, we don\u2019t think a potential Democratic sweep should be at the top of investors\u2019 list of worries.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.15.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Best of July Likely Over\n\n&gt; NASDAQ\u2019s mid-year rally came to an end on Tuesday, July 14. During the rally\u2019s 12-day stretch beginning on the third to last day of June through the ninth trading day in July, NASDAQ gained 4.7%. This is well above its average performance since 1985 but less than half of its best showing from 1999. At NASDAQ\u2019s high close during the rally on July 10 it was up 6.0%. Historically around this time in July is when the market has begun to weaken as NASDAQ\u2019s full-month average performance is just 0.9% since 1985.\n\n&gt; In the following chart, July\u2019s seasonal pattern over the last 21 years has been plotted with July 2020, plotted on the right axis for comparison through yesterday\u2019s close. This July\u2019s well above average performance so far called for a second, larger range in order to aid in the comparison. Over the last 21 years the market\u2019s trend has been lower beginning right around mid-month through the close. DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 &amp; 2000 have on average given back some or all of their first half of July gains.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a338dcb9c5355ebe07758987a0a3d941/d984701acc1b4792-9e/s540x810/6c7c264a92ed27d9043da27d7ef2acdaa40dbfae.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/b0cbc0824312a8c984564b62747031d3/d984701acc1b4792-3d/s500x750/8112f6ccc64548e6c274778901c34992a18b658e.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$TSLA** \n&gt; * **$MSFT** \n&gt; * **$KO** \n&gt; * **$SNAP** \n&gt; * **$LMT** \n&gt; * **$HAL** \n&gt; * **$TWTR** \n&gt; * **$T** \n&gt; * **$AAL** \n&gt; * **$LUV** \n&gt; * **$INTC** \n&gt; * **$BMRC** \n&gt; * **$PM** \n&gt; * **$CMG** \n&gt; * **$VZ** \n&gt; * **$PLD** \n&gt; * **$NDAQ** \n&gt; * **$NVS** \n&gt; * **$UAL** \n&gt; * **$MAN** \n&gt; * **$IBM** \n&gt; * **$CALM** \n&gt; * **$AXP** \n&gt; * **$PHG** \n&gt; * **$BIIB** \n&gt; * **$TSCO** \n&gt; * **$LII** \n&gt; * **$ONB** \n&gt; * **$TMO** \n&gt; * **$SYF** \n&gt; * **$TXN** \n&gt; * **$KEY** \n&gt; * **$CIT** \n&gt; * **$MKTX** \n&gt; * **$CTXS** \n&gt; * **$ISRG** \n&gt; * **$CMA** \n&gt; * **$CHKP** \n&gt; * **$LLNW** \n&gt; * **$HCA** \n&gt; * **$CDNS**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/xTm8QYrx/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/FF8zwz6k/ervol1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR MONDAY, JULY 20TH, 2020!](https://i.postimg.cc/x1p7ZdD4/er1.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.20.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/E6wNTxx.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.20.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/aGg73Qq.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.21.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pBhcRIP.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Pdlt5pp.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.22.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/c5ceAoH.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.22.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MmWZB8E.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.23.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rm0IsJb.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/1lXaIJm.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/nc5F8qw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.24.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Kmrh21e.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.24.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/4aRpYtr.png))\n\n*****\n\n# Tesla, Inc. -\n&gt; **Tesla, Inc.

It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares.

The overarching theme behind these picks is **American Innovation &amp; Mexican Development.**\n\nI'm a 26 year old fintech engineer in the US and an avocado farmer in Mexico and I hold a strong conviction that investing in Mexican development will reward me well in the decades to come.\n\n**In a nutshell, the USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring and my strategy favors the Texas-Nuevo Leon economy and overall Mexican-American trade.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is Monterrey, Nuevo Leon\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219352-ec946e00-bb36-11ea-9fc3-b17c9e5b0597.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219352-ec946e00-bb36-11ea-9fc3-b17c9e5b0597.png))\n\nI'm from a rural village south of Jalisco which produces far more agricultural goods like avocados alongside Michoacan.\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219771-7e9c7680-bb37-11ea-98b2-7e8c2833d99a.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219771-7e9c7680-bb37-11ea-98b2-7e8c2833d99a.png))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am very aware of the problems that Mexico faces but I also view Mexico as a sleeping giant that the US utilizes for capital efficiency in global trade. Mexico is part of a puzzle that fits in a large scope that involves other bulwark nations like Germany, Japan, Brazil, and India.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n!\\[Bulwark Trading Nations\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86080247-51709b00-ba47-11ea-8d38-54da06916f57.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86080247-51709b00-ba47-11ea-8d38-54da06916f57.png))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n!\\[The North American Trade Block\\]([https://preview.redd.it/c4ej9hcrki751.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0062950618749d315101fb97d09237db961e2d40](https://preview.redd.it/c4ej9hcrki751.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0062950618749d315101fb97d09237db961e2d40))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the same time, Mexico is a nation in crisis. The economic damage narcotrafficking has delivered has resulted in:\n\n\\- \\[An increasing black market integration into the global money supply, in the order of hundreds of billions of dollars, resulting in a growing vacuum of theft AKA the Drug War &amp; Economics of Peace\\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank\\_Secrecy\\_Act#Sanctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_Secrecy_Act#Sanctions))\n\n\\- North American suppressed wage suppression\n\n\\- refugee style illegal immigration\n\n\\- NA workforce morale decrease\n\n\\- Mexican workforce morale decrease\n\n\\- A Mexican workforce and brain drain, as skilled and motivated laborers leave for opportunity and better pay who are loyal to both nations\n\n\\- Multiple events of civil unrest or civil disasters\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- National cyncism against the current administration\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI see this as a complex problem where most people's perspective is not complete or clouded by one of the reasons above. I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed.

The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

        "selftext": "On social media, this disruptor company has been called the Robinhood of fintech.  Its customer base is the little guy: small and medium enterprises the world over.  Thanks to its fintech, the company enables these same businesses to obtain trade finance and engage in global trade, treading where at least 60% of banks and trading companies won\u2019t in a $40 trillion industry.  This first mover aims to address the $1.5 trillion gap in SME trade finance.\n\nBetter yet, this industry disruptor has not only survived the COVID-19 pandemic, but it has thrived.  [Not least because it is based in Singapore, a solid financial hub with robust disease control measures.]\n\nTrade and trade finance will only migrate more and more to the online platform of this [\u201cmost innovative fintech company\u201d in Asia-Pacific](https://d2tyltutevw8th.cloudfront.net/media/document/press-release-the-innovators-2020-regional-winn-1588769601.pdf) (*Global Finance*).\n\nLater this very month, Triterras will enter into a definitive merger agreement with the 7th-ranking special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) on Robinhood\u2019s list of Blank Check Companies: Netfin Acquisition Corp ($NFIN).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8omJ_Hzz08M\n\n**TRANSACTION VALUES**\n\nPublished transaction values are as follows:\n\nPre-money equity value is approximately $670 million.\n\nPost money equity value is approximately $939 million.\n\nProposed enterprise value is approximately $995 million.\n\nTo put things into a conservative perspective:\n\nPre-money equity value to NFIN market cap ratio (7/02): 1.92\n\nPost-money equity value to NFIN market cap ratio (7/02): 2.69\n\nProposed enterprise value to NFIN market cap ratio (7/02): 2.85\n\n**GROWTH PROSPECTS**\n\nWhile already profitable at $87 million EBITDA and $46 million consolidated net income, Triterras is aiming to more than double these two performance measures by the end of their next fiscal year.  Of the $1.5 trillion gap in SME trade finance, it has addressed $4.1 billion, and aims to more than double this by the end of fiscal 2021.  That the company has three modules for its Kratos platform, [two more than the end of calendar 2019](https://www.gtreview.com/news/fintech/blockchain-fintech-triterras-goes-live-with-trade-finance-product-for-smes/), indicates its commitment to developing that platform further as part of its business growth story.\n\nSomething suggests that $NFIN\u2019s proposed enterprise value may be a discount on a growth company.  Its valuation seems to be based on a multiple of fiscal 2019 EBITDA, rather than on a multiple of sales.  It is definitely not based on a multiple of fiscal 2021 sales.\n\nOh, well.  Let that proposed enterprise value stand before the merger.  It just might go noticeably past that in the short term, even after all the equity dilution is said and done.\n\n*Disclosure: Long on $NFIN.*",

SPY holds 257 Billion. If this fund decides to move just .5% out of Microsoft they would be redistributing 1 billion amongst the lower tier stocks. Will they do this? why not? They do it regularly, the question is if enough funds and ETF's do it at once, will it boost some stock and suppress others?\n\nBack to microsoft. SPY had 81 million shares as of yesterday. What did they have last september? 84 million.

Would they boost top holdings right now having such a massive run? if your mandate is to have a diverse portfolio, I doubt it.\n\nThis trend in the SPY ETF reducing holdings over the last year is also true of Apple, and Facebook but not Amazon.\n\nComapnies I like with low weights barring that something crazy with the virus doesn't happen and JPow's printer doesn't get jammed:\n\nCalls on :KO, PFE, INTC,  MMM, RTX",

        "selftext": "TLDR: Is this a good time to start a retirement fund for my parents or should I wait till after election (around January) once the cloud clears? I will max their traditional IRA into 2 etfs (SPY and QQQ) and 3 stocks (MSFT, COST, JNJ).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSituation:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheyre in their mid 50s and I will help them manage it.  Jointly, they make about 54k net per year (after taxes, insurance etc) but they dont have any sort of retirement fund/emergency fund currently. They just starting now since we are immigrants and was able to settle down just recently. They have a monthly expense of about $2600 (this includes a mortgage of 30 more years and a car payment of 4 years). They love to work, so they will probably retire in their 70s. Overall, they will have about 1900 per month in saving. My sibling and I are done with college and have our own jobs now. We are still with them but we're financially independent and plan to settle on our once their retirement fund is smooth sailing which will probably increase their monthly expenses to 3000$ since we will be contributing less (we are willing to help them as much as we could so it could stay as it is or hopefully even less depending on our future financial situation). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlan:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoth their 401k does not match so I am thinking of starting traditional IRA with schwab. My plan is to max out their traditional IRA (14k combined per year) and focus it into two ETFs (SPY and QQQ) and 3 stocks (MSFT, COST, JNJ). I will DCA equally into 5 on their red days. Overall, they will have 700$ per month left over (after retirement contribution with this plan and expenses) which they can use for leisure...or should I have them contribute some to 401k and/or roth?.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy rationale of starting now is I can have their retirement fund ride the recovery from the pandemic drop (roughly about 1/4 more left to V shape recovery). We can argue that there is another drop (which is very likely) but I am not worried since I am DCAing anyway and I dont think this \"2nd drop\" will be as bad as the first one (especially this election, i dont think the current admin will let this happen). Election aftermath is a different story. I dont know what to expect after election hence this post. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy investment choices rationale: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSPY - Diversified basket\n\nQQQ- Tech heavy growth basket (pandemic proof)\n\nMSFT - Tech growth (pandemic proof)\n\nCOST - retail growth (pandemic proof, arguably)\n\nJNJ - healthcare growth especially post pandemic (I am thinking of omitting this since I also feel this might be a risky choice for a late retirement account). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother route: Have their retirement fund professionally managed. If so where?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am thinking of asking this in other financial sub but my really concern here is my investment choices and timing (which i believe this sub has the best point of view/opinion on); time in the market is better than timing the market but I feel like timing for a late retirement account in this situation is especially important. I dont have much experience with the market (just recently started myself) but my educational background is enough to understand it and its caveats. Any feedback is greatly appreciated. Thanks.",

        "selftext": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-02/deutsche-bank-considers-financial-support-for-wirecard-bank-kc4tsbnd\n\nDeutsche Bank AG is weighing the acquisition of all or part of disgraced Wirecard AG\u2019s bank, potentially throwing the business a lifeline after one of the biggest corporate scandals in recent years.\n\nThe Frankfurt-based lender is in touch with regulator BaFin, Wirecard Bank\u2019s management board and administrators on possible further steps to help Wirecard\u2019s finance unit, a Deutsche Bank spokesman said by e-mail, without elaborating. Options include taking on pieces of Wirecard Bank or the unit in its entirety, people familiar with the matter said, adding that the lender is still debating other ways to help Wirecard Bank and hasn\u2019t made a final decision.\n\nDeutsche Bank had informal tie-up talks with the scandal-hit fintech last Spring, though it quickly broke off the preliminary discussions. Wirecard Bank -- which sat at the heart of the firm -- could be valuable to a potential acquirer because of its relationship with credit card companies Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. and JCB International, which are also key to other parts of Wirecard.\n\nDeutsche Bank may also be hit if Wirecard Bank were to file for insolvency. Germany\u2019s deposit insurance scheme for private banks would have to make depositors whole if the lender didn\u2019t have enough funds of its own to repay them. That could lead to higher contributions from the scheme members, of which Deutsche Bank is the biggest and highest paying.\n\nWirecard filed for insolvency last week after saying that almost 2 billion euros ($2.25 billion) it previously reported as cash probably never existed, throwing the future of its banking and others businesses into doubt. The company faces a potential avalanche of lawsuits and former Chief Executive Officer Markus Braun was arrested, though he is now out on bail.\n\nWhile Wirecard Bank isn\u2019t part of the bankruptcy proceedings, the parent ceded control of funds last week after the financial regulator stepped in to prevent the money from being deployed elsewhere.\n\n\u201cWe are currently reviewing the possibility of providing Wirecard Bank AG with financial support,\u201d Deutsche Bank said. \u201cWe are in principle prepared to provide this support in the context of a continuation of business operations, if such assistance should become necessary.\u201d\n\nInsolvency administrator Michael Jaffe said on Wednesday that the assets he\u2019s trying to sell are attracting interest from numerous investors. He didn\u2019t say whether he intends to sell Wirecard Bank as well, though said the lender remains solvent.\n\nTo fuel its growth, Wirecard had been paying depositors attractive interest at a time when traditional banks increasingly started to pass on negative rates. This year, it began offering a 0.75% interest rate via its Boon app, betting that more deposits will translate into more payments via its systems and lucrative contracts with stores and online merchants.\n\nIn addition to the earlier talks on a possible tie-up, the two financial firms had others links. Deutsche Bank is part of a lending group of 15 banks that together are owed about 1.6 billion euros, Bloomberg has reported. CEO Christian Sewing has been trying to shift the lender away from its reliance on trading income toward a focus on processing payments for companies, and he\u2019s made the division responsible for the business -- known as Corporate Bank -- the centerpiece of his large restructuring plan.\n\nSewing has focused tech investment on the Corporate Bank but he has also said that the division is being challenged by the low interest-rate environment it\u2019s operating in.\n\nThe collapse of Wirecard has prompted criticism of regulators and soul-searching among Germany\u2019s elite grappling for answers over the failure of what was once one of its most lauded companies. BaFin President Felix Hufeld has acknowledged that his institution is among those to blame for not catching the irregularities, which he referred to as \u201cmassive fraud\u201d on Thursday in Frankfurt.",

The stocks were higher with XLE $36.93 -.92 (2.43%).\n \n \nGOLD $1,779.30 -20.60. It was a continuation rally and a new recovery high OF $1807.70  Last night I said \u201cwe\u2019ve moved $50 since the low on Friday and while the trend and momentum are positive, we may have to test 1790 to consolidate our gains.\u201d  Unfortunately, we pulled back to 1,767 instead.  We rallied a bit and finished only slightly better. We bought back the 3rd and final lot of NEM @ $58.86.  And, we also added a half position in NEM 7/17 60 calls @ $1.55, and additional 50% @ $1.30 on Friday.  We sold half on the 100% Up Rule @ $2.94 yesterday and we closed $2.81 - .49 today.\n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $9,325 + 140. After trading back to 8985 we rallied back to close \u2013 only $5.  Since last week we have closed between 9200 \u2013 92.85 every day with narrow ranges and today was a good start to move higher.  A break over 10,000 still sends us higher. We added 350 shares of GBTC last Wednesday @ $10.02 to our position of 400 @ $8.06, bringing our average price to $8.97. GBTC closed $9.77 + .17 today.\n \n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

        "selftext": "Hello, Redditors,\n\nI have started investing a couple of years back. I had my fair share of gambling with penny stocks and other FOMO stocks. Finally settled on investing only in MSFT, APPL, GOOG, V, AMZN. Other stocks of interest are TSM, BABA, LUV, DIS. I have around 10k to invest, and I have been waiting on the sidelines watching stocks hit bottom in March and back to all-time highs again. And, I have decided to get into the market with the DCA approach. I am planning to buy $500 worth of stocks (fractional stocks - a mix of MSFT, APPL, GOOG, V, AMZN, TSM, LUV) on a weekly basis to hedge against volatility. So, my question is, is there a way to automate the process? Let's say if I want to buy 5 shares (fraction of each MSFT, APPL, GOOG, V, AMZN) I have to make 5 different orders.\n\nAlso, any suggestions my stock picks and DCA, in general, will be highly appreciated. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you.",

I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

I\u2019m bummed that I didn\u2019t hold any stock long term even though I was an early adopter of AMZN, NFLX etc. and being in tech I knew they were going to be big, even NVDA or SHOP couple years ago. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t want to lose the next 10-15 years. I want to invest in a disciplined way, buy around 20 stocks and then add on dips, So I\u2019ll keep around $100K cash. My big confusion is which 20 stocks to pick? I\u2019ve been reading here, checking TipRanks, have Motley fool advisor and the list I come up with is huge. I\u2019m pasting the symbols that have creeped into my planning spreadsheet below. Also I\u2019m confused whether to buy fewer stocks at higher investment or many at lower. Also whether more investment into the stable large names (MSFT, AMZN, AAPL) or more in relatively newer names (SE, DOCU, NET etc.) I\u2019ve searched many posts on the \u201c20 stock portfolio\u201d or such but my confusion will not go away. Hence I\u2019m posting here to hear from you directly. I\u2019m 42 years old, good stable job, will have $50K more to add to the portfolio every year. I\u2019m open to moderate risk. Help me with a 15-20 stock investment portfolio that I can hold long term and add on dips. Here\u2019s what\u2019s on my spreadsheet right now:\n\nNewer stars 2 yrs: SE, NET, CRWD, CHWY, FSLY, DDOG, TTD, ZS, TWLO, TEAM, SPLK, MDB, WORK, SHOP\n\nETFs: ARKK, ARKW, WCLD, QQQ\n\nPayments or Banks: SQ, PYPL, V, JPM, BAC \n\nBetting: GAN, DKNG, PENN\n\nChips: NVDA, AMD, MU\n\nEnergy: ENPH, NEE, PCG, FANG\n\nHealthcare: LVGO, TDOC, UNH, MOH, DHR, CATS, VEEV, MODN\n\nCovid: HOLX, NVAX, MRNA, INO, IBIO, AYTU, VBIV , TTOO\n\nEVs: TSLA, NIO, WKHS, FUV, GRAF, PLUG\n\nFANG stocks: MSFT, AMZN, AAPL, GOOG, FB\n\nSocial/Entertain: PINS, NFLX, ROKU\n\nCyber: PANW, ZS, CRWD, NET, PING, FNET, FEYE\n\nBeaten down (1 year recovery): WYNN, LVS, DAL, LUV, STWD, SPG, CAR, MAR, RCL\n\nMy Options are:\n1) Invest $10K into 50 stocks since I can\u2019t choose with all the confusion\n2) Choose 15 stocks and invest $30K each or so \n3) Invest more % in couple categories above like the FANG stocks, ETFs, EVs, and less in others \n4) Buy 100 shares of 15 or so from the above list and sell covered calls getting ~$4K per week (but with the limited upside of covered calls, downside will be the same as holding) \n5) Stay 50% or more cash since the market could crash given the high valuations, pandemic and election year \n6) Something else that you\u2019d do in my shoes",

I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy. It is certainly in a golden era of sorts, and Mexico reflects as a nation in decline.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# The Economic Framework\n\nI am selecting industries that:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Empower the US and have a rippling effect on Mexico\n\n\\- Will fundamentally continue to build and grow the future global supply\n\n\\- Are friendly to primarily German/Euro and Japanese/Asian trade.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# My Portfolio Structure\n\nThere are two systems at play at the same time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe 12 Primary Asset Collection - these are stocks I regularly invest in.\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86082755-62bca600-ba4d-11ea-8857-95e902f8d0ce.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86082755-62bca600-ba4d-11ea-8857-95e902f8d0ce.png))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe 12 Competitor Arenas (Cloud Infrastructure Group) - these are stocks that are competing for Primary Asset Allocation each quarter and receive less allocation.\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86082923-c3e47980-ba4d-11ea-9543-b31eb000962d.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86082923-c3e47980-ba4d-11ea-9543-b31eb000962d.png))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I own 12 primary companies.

I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed.

The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.
