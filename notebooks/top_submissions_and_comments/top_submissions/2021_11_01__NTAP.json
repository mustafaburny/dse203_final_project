However, with the whole Twitter commotion and possible dip in TSLA stock, I am wondering how this could affect the market overall. \n\nCould Elon\u2019s decision have an impact on other stocks on the market? Or would it not impact specific stocks? Or just shake TSLA stock as a whole? I couldn\u2019t really find a discussion on that exact topic on this thread.\n\nI would appreciate your opinions on what kind of impact Elon\u2019s decision could have on the overall Stock market, if any, and if we should hold of with investments to see what actually happens Monday morning.",

        "selftext": "Good Friday afternoon to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 29th, 2021.\n\n# **Covid developments to rule the market once again in the week ahead after Friday\u2019s rout - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/26/covid-developments-to-rule-the-market-once-again-in-the-week-ahead-after-fridays-rout.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Uncertainty about a new emerging coronavirus strain could continue to spook markets, just as Friday\u2019s employment report and other data in the week ahead show the economy has been getting stronger.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks and other risk assets were slammed in the post-Thanksgiving session Friday on reports of a new variant in South Africa, and investors sought safety in Treasurys. Initial reports on the variant show it could be more transmissible than the Delta variant, and scientists are studying how effective vaccines are against it.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow was down 905 points, or 2.5% Friday in its worse day since October, 2020. The S&amp;P 500 tumbled 2.3% Friday to 4,594, giving it a 2.2% decline for the week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think that\u2019s going to override what else we\u2019re going to see,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. \u201cIt\u2019s a heavy data week with the ISMs and certainly payrolls, but I think this new variant is going to freeze behavior until there\u2019s more clarity.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; According to Dow Jones, economists expect a strong payroll report Friday, with 581,000 jobs added, after October\u2019s 531,000 payrolls. They expect the economy has shaken off the effects of the slowdown linked to the Covid delta variant, and growth in the current quarter could be far stronger than the third quarter.\n*****\n&gt; The Institute of Supply Management manufacturing survey is released Wednesday, and that should also be strong.\n*****\n&gt; Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com, said many traders were caught off sides in the shortened session Friday, usually a positive one for the market, and there are key levels the market must hold in the week ahead in order to stage a yearend Santa rally.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cRight now, the market lost some momentum, but it\u2019s not broken. It could be just fine and refuel if the 50-day moving average on the S&amp;P 500 holds next week. It\u2019s all very fluid,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The 50-day, at 4,527, is a widely-watched momentum indicator, and it is basically the average close of the last 50 sessions.\n*****\n&gt; The market had already been losing momentum this past Monday with a bearish reversal, he said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOn Wednesday, the market absorbed the weakness and gave traders a false sense of security which is normally a nice easy holiday-shortened session Friday,\u201d Redler said.\n*****\n&gt; Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, said the S&amp;P 500 typically gains 7% between its October low and year-end close, but this year it had already gained more than 9%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re ahead of the game and due for some sort of digestion,\u201d Stovall said on CNBC.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow dipped more than 1,000 points during Friday trading. Riskier assets were down even more, with the Russell 2000 closing off 3.7% Friday. West Texas Intermediate oil futures plunged more than 12%, and bitcoin was down nearly 8%. Some investors began to reverse bets in the futures market that a strong economic rebound and inflationary pressures would pull the Fed off the sidelines sooner-than-expected.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield, which moves opposite price, fell to 1.48% from Wednesday\u2019s high of 1.69%.\n*****\n&gt; Investors will be looking for guidance from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who appears before Congress in the week ahead with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to discuss the coronavirus and the CARES Act stimulus package. On Tuesday, there is a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think you have to assume the base case is the virus remains endemic, not back to being a pandemic,\u201d said Barry Knapp, founder of Ironsides Macroeconomics. The worry is that the variant spreads and slows activity, hitting supply chains even more. That could boost inflation while slowing growth.\n*****\n&gt; Knapp said there are risks for stocks, and investors need to be cautious buying the market on the decline.\n*****\n&gt; Knapp said the Fed could end up accelerating the taper of its bond purchases, which would move forward the time frame for potential interest rate hikes.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe problem with trying to buy the market overall and buying tech stocks in particular is if you buy now because it is down a couple of percent, it rallies into the end of the year and then the market sells off,\u201d he said. For that reason, he favors dipping into cheaper sectors like energy and financials, the worst performing sectors Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Oil and energy will be in the spotlight in the coming week, as OPEC+ meets Thursday. The U.S. and other governments agreed to release oil from their strategic petroleum reserves in an attempt to drive prices lower. The U.S. plans to release 50 million barrels.\n*****\n&gt; OPEC+ has said it would continue to increase production by 400,000 barrels monthly, despite calls from the White House to speed up the release.\n*****\n&gt; Helima Croft, head of global commodities strategy at RBC, said on CNBC there is a chance OPEC could decide to pause its own production increase because of the SPR releases.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think as we head into the OPEC meeting Thursday, the question is not only do they do a pause but potentially will they actually pull back some barrels because of concerns about this new variant alongside the very large SPR release,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; She said the U.S. is releasing a record amount of oil. \u201cWe are going to have a lot of barrels hitting this market, as we have these concerns about new Covid lockdown restrictions,\u201d she said. \u201cAgain, too soon to say whether governments will pull the trigger on such measures, but the market will be concerned.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ISOlH6m.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ICn6AUF.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ddHELXX.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/2Qq5aaa.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/Jml9Z5I.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pZuwqcf.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ICn6AUF.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zz3mXj8.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/RIguq8O.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eQQE2zm.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pX1v49l.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/QA0QmDF.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # When Stocks Are Up Big YTD Before Thanksgiving\n\n&gt; As the S&amp;P 500 is up rather impressively, 24.9% year-to-date this year through today\u2019s close on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, we ran the numbers on the 33 previous years with double digit year-to-date gains at this juncture since 1950. There are a few blemishes, but in general market gains continued into yearend.\n\n&gt; Most importantly, there are no major selloffs on this list. The big December decline of -9.2% in 2018 came after the S&amp;P 500 was down -1.2% at this point in the year. After double-digit YTD gains the S&amp;P 500 was up 70% of the time from the Tuesday before Thanksgiving to yearend for an average gain of 2.3%.\n\n&gt; Also of note is that the Santa Claus Rally suffered only four losses in these years. But these four down SCRs in 1955, 1968, 1999 and 2014 were followed by flat years in 1956 and 2015 and down years in 1969 and 2000. As Yale\u2019s famous line states (2021 Almanac page 116 and 2022 Almanac page 118): \u201cIf Santa Claus Should Fail To Call, Bears May Come to Broad and Wall.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/2bbdc6f36627e690a68da0b174749618/6328b31e9c88f708-62/s500x750/f9d585fa7d441cb8e0ed7dfe493904d6b68a23ae.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # How Have Stocks Done Under Jerome Powell?\n\n&gt; The big news this week was Jerome Powell will remain in charge of the Federal Reserve (Fed) for four more years, so we wanted to do a quick blog that looked at how stocks have done while he has been the Fed Chairman.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere are many reasons for Jerome Powell to lead the Fed for another four years,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut one of the best could very well be that stocks have done quite well under his leadership. Do you really think he\u2019d still be in charge if stocks did poorly under him? Probably not is the answer there.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Dow has gained 40% under his leadership, ranking him 8th (near the middle of the pack) when compared with all 16 Fed Chairpersons. Interestingly, he ranks just beneath both of his predecessors in Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen. With four more years to go, you\u2019d have to like his chances there, but Alan Greenspan\u2019s record of 312% is likely safe for the time being.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blog-11.24.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Here are some more Fed Chair fun facts (using the chart below).\n\n&gt; * On an annualized basis, the Dow has gained 9.3% per annum under Powell, the 7th best out of 16.\n&gt; * Interestingly, stocks have dropped under only one Fed Chairperson and that was Eugene Meyer during the Great Depression.\n&gt; * Taking another look at Greenspan\u2019s 312% return and we realize he was in charge of the Fed for 18.5 years. So his annual return of 8.0% puts things in perspective.\n&gt; * The shortest tenure ever was less than a year and a half back in the late 1970s under William Miller. Meanwhile, the longest ever was William Martin at nearly 19 years.\n&gt; * Paul Volker had the best annualized return at 15.2% over his 8 years. Not to mention he handed things over to Greenspan right before the 1987 crash, one of the best handoffs we\u2019ve ever seen in history.\n&gt; * Lastly, the Fed has been led by a woman only once and that was Janet Yellen, now in charge of the Treasury. It is worth noting that her four-year run at the Fed produced a very impressive 12.9% annualized return for stocks.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chart-11.24.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Finally Some Clarity on Fed Leadership\n\n&gt; President Biden officially nominated Chairman Jerome Powell to a second four-year term as Chairman of the Federal Reserve (Fed) and elevated current Fed Governor Lael Brainard to Vice Chair of the Committee. Before the announcement, there was speculation that Brainard could replace Powell as Fed Chair.\n\n&gt; We view these nominations as very market friendly. Powell has done a commendable job supporting markets during the COVID-19 shutdowns and we aren\u2019t quite through with the pandemic. We believe stability and leadership continuity is important as we continue to make our way toward the finish line of the COVID-19 pandemic. While Brainard is well qualified to run the Fed, elevating her to Vice Chair recognizes her contributions and potentially puts her in a position to take over the Chair role in four years. Both positions require Congressional approval, and we think both should be confirmed when Congressional hearings conclude sometime over the next few months.\n\n&gt; \u201cAs we expected, President Biden chose continuity and familiarity with these Fed appointments,\u201d noted LPL Financial Fixed Income Strategist Lawrence Gillum. \u201cGoing with Powell over Brainard is what markets were expecting, so we think markets are relieved that Fed leadership uncertainty is now out of the way.\u201d\n\n&gt; The knee-jerk reaction in the bond market was interesting in that markets seemingly continue to shift the prospects for interest rate hikes forward. As seen on the LPL Research Chart of the Day, Treasury securities across all maturities sold off with two-year tenors among the most (negatively) impacted. Now, two-year Treasury yields are at the highest level since the pandemic began. Short maturity securities are the most impacted by changes in monetary policy. Moreover, markets are pricing in nearly three rate hikes next year with the first rate hike expected in June, which is much more aggressive than the Fed has indicated.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11.23.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; President Biden still has three open Fed Board of Governor positions to fill, so we\u2019re a long way from knowing for sure how Fed policy may change over the next few years. However, we would expect Biden to select governors on the dovish side of the spectrum. That said, the 2022 voting rotation with regional Fed Presidents may impart a hawkish lean to the FOMC overall, offsetting some of the dovish bias from Biden\u2019s appointments. The rotation replaces three solidly dovish and one strongly hawkish voting members with two strongly hawkish and two solidly hawkish officials. Monetary policy is managed at the national level, so while the regional presidents will no doubt have influence, we continue to think the Fed will be more accommodative than markets are currently expecting. In addition, with the announcements today, leadership at the top of the Fed should be seen as being supportive to the economy and thus supportive for markets.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Pandemic and Multi-Decade Low for Claims\n\n&gt; Out of the massive slug of economic data this morning, one major bright spot was jobless claims. It has now been 88 weeks since the March 13, 2020 release; the last one before claims began to print in the millions. In that time, claims have fallen to not only take out pre-pandemic levels and the low prior to that of 203K set in April 2019 but today saw the first sub-200K reading since November 20, 1969. That compares to estimates of a reading of 260K and last week's 2K upward revised number of 270K. On a side note, in 2019 there were three weeks where the initial release of initial claims came in below 200K (1/24, 4/11, and 4/18), but they have been since revised higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/112421-Claims-SA.png))**\n\n&gt; While that is a significant low in claims, the drop appears to a large degree to be thanks to seasonal adjustment. On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, claims rose to 258.6K which was the highest level in six weeks. It is seasonally normal for claims to head higher during the current week of the year with it having happened over 80% of the time historically. Additionally, that is a bit of catch-up considering claims have been bucking seasonal trends in recent weeks.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/112421-Claims-Seasonal.png))**\n\n&gt; Continuing claims were also lower this week falling from 2.109 million to 2.049 million. As with initial jobless claims, that sets a new low for the pandemic that is 265K above the level from March 13, 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/112421-Con-Claims-SA.png))**\n\n&gt; Factoring in all other programs creates an additional week of lag to the data meaning the most recent print is through the first week of November. The final week of October's unusual uptick on account of peculiar growth in claims for expired programs has unwound in the most recent week's data. PUA claims were more than cut in half as PEUC claims also fell by 121K. Combined that resulted in a new low of 2.44 million claims.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/112421-Claims-NSA.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending November 26th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.28.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * (**$CRM $ASAN $CRWD $SNOW $AI $OKTA $SPLK $DOCU $SNEX $JKS $MOMO $CHS $WDH $UCL $RDHL $ZS $AMBA $BOX $NTAP $HPE $BBW $RY $DCI $VEEV $DG $EXPR $SIG $VERU $LE $MRVL $ULTA $SWBI**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/eQQE2zm.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/EDL3xa4.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/OkxZbaZ.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.29.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/XWYrfnw.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.29.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/E6rgE4M.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  11.30.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jqz0nFS.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 11.30.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oFuzxf4.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.1.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EUMKcBz.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.1.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7VZJksg.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.2.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/N3mMigQ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.2.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/4ob72Tx.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.3.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/5E0Yzkt.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.3.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n&gt; **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket. :)",

        "selftext": "Good Friday afternoon to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 29th, 2021.\n\n# **Covid developments to rule the market once again in the week ahead after Friday\u2019s rout - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/26/covid-developments-to-rule-the-market-once-again-in-the-week-ahead-after-fridays-rout.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Uncertainty about a new emerging coronavirus strain could continue to spook markets, just as Friday\u2019s employment report and other data in the week ahead show the economy has been getting stronger.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks and other risk assets were slammed in the post-Thanksgiving session Friday on reports of a new variant in South Africa, and investors sought safety in Treasurys. Initial reports on the variant show it could be more transmissible than the Delta variant, and scientists are studying how effective vaccines are against it.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow was down 905 points, or 2.5% Friday in its worse day since October, 2020. The S&amp;P 500 tumbled 2.3% Friday to 4,594, giving it a 2.2% decline for the week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think that\u2019s going to override what else we\u2019re going to see,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. \u201cIt\u2019s a heavy data week with the ISMs and certainly payrolls, but I think this new variant is going to freeze behavior until there\u2019s more clarity.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; According to Dow Jones, economists expect a strong payroll report Friday, with 581,000 jobs added, after October\u2019s 531,000 payrolls. They expect the economy has shaken off the effects of the slowdown linked to the Covid delta variant, and growth in the current quarter could be far stronger than the third quarter.\n*****\n&gt; The Institute of Supply Management manufacturing survey is released Wednesday, and that should also be strong.\n*****\n&gt; Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com, said many traders were caught off sides in the shortened session Friday, usually a positive one for the market, and there are key levels the market must hold in the week ahead in order to stage a yearend Santa rally.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cRight now, the market lost some momentum, but it\u2019s not broken. It could be just fine and refuel if the 50-day moving average on the S&amp;P 500 holds next week. It\u2019s all very fluid,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The 50-day, at 4,527, is a widely-watched momentum indicator, and it is basically the average close of the last 50 sessions.\n*****\n&gt; The market had already been losing momentum this past Monday with a bearish reversal, he said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOn Wednesday, the market absorbed the weakness and gave traders a false sense of security which is normally a nice easy holiday-shortened session Friday,\u201d Redler said.\n*****\n&gt; Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, said the S&amp;P 500 typically gains 7% between its October low and year-end close, but this year it had already gained more than 9%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re ahead of the game and due for some sort of digestion,\u201d Stovall said on CNBC.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow dipped more than 1,000 points during Friday trading. Riskier assets were down even more, with the Russell 2000 closing off 3.7% Friday. West Texas Intermediate oil futures plunged more than 12%, and bitcoin was down nearly 8%. Some investors began to reverse bets in the futures market that a strong economic rebound and inflationary pressures would pull the Fed off the sidelines sooner-than-expected.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield, which moves opposite price, fell to 1.48% from Wednesday\u2019s high of 1.69%.\n*****\n&gt; Investors will be looking for guidance from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who appears before Congress in the week ahead with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to discuss the coronavirus and the CARES Act stimulus package. On Tuesday, there is a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think you have to assume the base case is the virus remains endemic, not back to being a pandemic,\u201d said Barry Knapp, founder of Ironsides Macroeconomics. The worry is that the variant spreads and slows activity, hitting supply chains even more. That could boost inflation while slowing growth.\n*****\n&gt; Knapp said there are risks for stocks, and investors need to be cautious buying the market on the decline.\n*****\n&gt; Knapp said the Fed could end up accelerating the taper of its bond purchases, which would move forward the time frame for potential interest rate hikes.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe problem with trying to buy the market overall and buying tech stocks in particular is if you buy now because it is down a couple of percent, it rallies into the end of the year and then the market sells off,\u201d he said. For that reason, he favors dipping into cheaper sectors like energy and financials, the worst performing sectors Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Oil and energy will be in the spotlight in the coming week, as OPEC+ meets Thursday. The U.S. and other governments agreed to release oil from their strategic petroleum reserves in an attempt to drive prices lower. The U.S. plans to release 50 million barrels.\n*****\n&gt; OPEC+ has said it would continue to increase production by 400,000 barrels monthly, despite calls from the White House to speed up the release.\n*****\n&gt; Helima Croft, head of global commodities strategy at RBC, said on CNBC there is a chance OPEC could decide to pause its own production increase because of the SPR releases.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think as we head into the OPEC meeting Thursday, the question is not only do they do a pause but potentially will they actually pull back some barrels because of concerns about this new variant alongside the very large SPR release,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; She said the U.S. is releasing a record amount of oil. \u201cWe are going to have a lot of barrels hitting this market, as we have these concerns about new Covid lockdown restrictions,\u201d she said. \u201cAgain, too soon to say whether governments will pull the trigger on such measures, but the market will be concerned.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ISOlH6m.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ICn6AUF.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ddHELXX.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/2Qq5aaa.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/Jml9Z5I.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pZuwqcf.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ICn6AUF.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zz3mXj8.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/RIguq8O.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eQQE2zm.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pX1v49l.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/QA0QmDF.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # When Stocks Are Up Big YTD Before Thanksgiving\n\n&gt; As the S&amp;P 500 is up rather impressively, 24.9% year-to-date this year through today\u2019s close on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, we ran the numbers on the 33 previous years with double digit year-to-date gains at this juncture since 1950. There are a few blemishes, but in general market gains continued into yearend.\n\n&gt; Most importantly, there are no major selloffs on this list. The big December decline of -9.2% in 2018 came after the S&amp;P 500 was down -1.2% at this point in the year. After double-digit YTD gains the S&amp;P 500 was up 70% of the time from the Tuesday before Thanksgiving to yearend for an average gain of 2.3%.\n\n&gt; Also of note is that the Santa Claus Rally suffered only four losses in these years. But these four down SCRs in 1955, 1968, 1999 and 2014 were followed by flat years in 1956 and 2015 and down years in 1969 and 2000. As Yale\u2019s famous line states (2021 Almanac page 116 and 2022 Almanac page 118): \u201cIf Santa Claus Should Fail To Call, Bears May Come to Broad and Wall.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/2bbdc6f36627e690a68da0b174749618/6328b31e9c88f708-62/s500x750/f9d585fa7d441cb8e0ed7dfe493904d6b68a23ae.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # How Have Stocks Done Under Jerome Powell?\n\n&gt; The big news this week was Jerome Powell will remain in charge of the Federal Reserve (Fed) for four more years, so we wanted to do a quick blog that looked at how stocks have done while he has been the Fed Chairman.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere are many reasons for Jerome Powell to lead the Fed for another four years,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut one of the best could very well be that stocks have done quite well under his leadership. Do you really think he\u2019d still be in charge if stocks did poorly under him? Probably not is the answer there.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Dow has gained 40% under his leadership, ranking him 8th (near the middle of the pack) when compared with all 16 Fed Chairpersons. Interestingly, he ranks just beneath both of his predecessors in Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen. With four more years to go, you\u2019d have to like his chances there, but Alan Greenspan\u2019s record of 312% is likely safe for the time being.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blog-11.24.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Here are some more Fed Chair fun facts (using the chart below).\n\n&gt; * On an annualized basis, the Dow has gained 9.3% per annum under Powell, the 7th best out of 16.\n&gt; * Interestingly, stocks have dropped under only one Fed Chairperson and that was Eugene Meyer during the Great Depression.\n&gt; * Taking another look at Greenspan\u2019s 312% return and we realize he was in charge of the Fed for 18.5 years. So his annual return of 8.0% puts things in perspective.\n&gt; * The shortest tenure ever was less than a year and a half back in the late 1970s under William Miller. Meanwhile, the longest ever was William Martin at nearly 19 years.\n&gt; * Paul Volker had the best annualized return at 15.2% over his 8 years. Not to mention he handed things over to Greenspan right before the 1987 crash, one of the best handoffs we\u2019ve ever seen in history.\n&gt; * Lastly, the Fed has been led by a woman only once and that was Janet Yellen, now in charge of the Treasury. It is worth noting that her four-year run at the Fed produced a very impressive 12.9% annualized return for stocks.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chart-11.24.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Finally Some Clarity on Fed Leadership\n\n&gt; President Biden officially nominated Chairman Jerome Powell to a second four-year term as Chairman of the Federal Reserve (Fed) and elevated current Fed Governor Lael Brainard to Vice Chair of the Committee. Before the announcement, there was speculation that Brainard could replace Powell as Fed Chair.\n\n&gt; We view these nominations as very market friendly. Powell has done a commendable job supporting markets during the COVID-19 shutdowns and we aren\u2019t quite through with the pandemic. We believe stability and leadership continuity is important as we continue to make our way toward the finish line of the COVID-19 pandemic. While Brainard is well qualified to run the Fed, elevating her to Vice Chair recognizes her contributions and potentially puts her in a position to take over the Chair role in four years. Both positions require Congressional approval, and we think both should be confirmed when Congressional hearings conclude sometime over the next few months.\n\n&gt; \u201cAs we expected, President Biden chose continuity and familiarity with these Fed appointments,\u201d noted LPL Financial Fixed Income Strategist Lawrence Gillum. \u201cGoing with Powell over Brainard is what markets were expecting, so we think markets are relieved that Fed leadership uncertainty is now out of the way.\u201d\n\n&gt; The knee-jerk reaction in the bond market was interesting in that markets seemingly continue to shift the prospects for interest rate hikes forward. As seen on the LPL Research Chart of the Day, Treasury securities across all maturities sold off with two-year tenors among the most (negatively) impacted. Now, two-year Treasury yields are at the highest level since the pandemic began. Short maturity securities are the most impacted by changes in monetary policy. Moreover, markets are pricing in nearly three rate hikes next year with the first rate hike expected in June, which is much more aggressive than the Fed has indicated.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11.23.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; President Biden still has three open Fed Board of Governor positions to fill, so we\u2019re a long way from knowing for sure how Fed policy may change over the next few years. However, we would expect Biden to select governors on the dovish side of the spectrum. That said, the 2022 voting rotation with regional Fed Presidents may impart a hawkish lean to the FOMC overall, offsetting some of the dovish bias from Biden\u2019s appointments. The rotation replaces three solidly dovish and one strongly hawkish voting members with two strongly hawkish and two solidly hawkish officials. Monetary policy is managed at the national level, so while the regional presidents will no doubt have influence, we continue to think the Fed will be more accommodative than markets are currently expecting. In addition, with the announcements today, leadership at the top of the Fed should be seen as being supportive to the economy and thus supportive for markets.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Pandemic and Multi-Decade Low for Claims\n\n&gt; Out of the massive slug of economic data this morning, one major bright spot was jobless claims. It has now been 88 weeks since the March 13, 2020 release; the last one before claims began to print in the millions. In that time, claims have fallen to not only take out pre-pandemic levels and the low prior to that of 203K set in April 2019 but today saw the first sub-200K reading since November 20, 1969. That compares to estimates of a reading of 260K and last week's 2K upward revised number of 270K. On a side note, in 2019 there were three weeks where the initial release of initial claims came in below 200K (1/24, 4/11, and 4/18), but they have been since revised higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/112421-Claims-SA.png))**\n\n&gt; While that is a significant low in claims, the drop appears to a large degree to be thanks to seasonal adjustment. On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, claims rose to 258.6K which was the highest level in six weeks. It is seasonally normal for claims to head higher during the current week of the year with it having happened over 80% of the time historically. Additionally, that is a bit of catch-up considering claims have been bucking seasonal trends in recent weeks.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/112421-Claims-Seasonal.png))**\n\n&gt; Continuing claims were also lower this week falling from 2.109 million to 2.049 million. As with initial jobless claims, that sets a new low for the pandemic that is 265K above the level from March 13, 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/112421-Con-Claims-SA.png))**\n\n&gt; Factoring in all other programs creates an additional week of lag to the data meaning the most recent print is through the first week of November. The final week of October's unusual uptick on account of peculiar growth in claims for expired programs has unwound in the most recent week's data. PUA claims were more than cut in half as PEUC claims also fell by 121K.

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/smallstreetbets sub! Welcome to the final trading day of November! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Tuesday, November 30th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Dow futures are down more than 350 points as investors try to gauge the economic impact of omicron](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/29/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n&gt; Stock futures tumbled in early Tuesday trading, reversing a Monday rebound on Wall Street as investors reassessed risks associated with the new omicron Covid variant.\n*****\n&gt; Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 390 points, or 1.1%. S&amp;P 500 futures tumbled 0.9% and Nasdaq 100 futures shed 0.5%.\n*****\n&gt; The reversal came after Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel told the Financial Times that he expects existing vaccines to be less effective against the new variant. The CEO told the paper there could be a \u201cmaterial drop\u201d in the current vaccines\u2019 effectiveness against this variant. Bancel told CNBC on Monday that it could take months to develop and ship an omicron-specific vaccine.\n*****\n&gt; Separately, Regeneron said its antibody treatment may have reduced effectiveness against omicron. Regeneron shares lost 3% in premarket trading.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield fell further below 1.45% as investors worried about the economy slowing because of the new variant. The 10-year rate lost 9 basis points to 1.44% (1 basis point equals 0.01%). The yield on the 10-year Treasury was as high as 1.69% last week before Friday\u2019s drop below 1.5%.\n*****\n&gt; The futures move lower follows a volatile last few sessions as investors evaluate the omicron impact. The Dow lost 905 points on Friday, then rebounded by 237 points on Monday.\n*****\n&gt; Travel shares, which led Friday\u2019s drop and then gained on Monday, were taking hits once again in premarket trading Tuesday. Expedia Group fell 2.3%, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings tumbled 3.8% and American Airlines shares were off 3.3%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe have to expect...that the scenarios, all scenarios, include discoveries of people in this country with omicron and talk that the vaccines don\u2019t work or if they did those who have had Covid have no immunity,\u201d wrote CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer on Twitter Tuesday. \u201cThese all cause selling.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Some leading pharma stocks also took a hit, with Moderna getting the worst of it as the stock decreased 4.2%. Pfizer, however, was one of the few companies to post gains on the S&amp;P 500, rising 1.2%. Stay-at-home stock Netflix also rose, up 0.7% and videoconference leader Zoom saw shares climb 2.3%.\n*****\n&gt; Major averages rose to session highs on Monday after President Joe Biden said economic lockdowns are currently off the table and there will be no new travel restrictions.\n*****\n&gt; The new Covid variant, first detected in South Africa, has now been found in more than a dozen countries, causing many to restrict travel. The World Health Organization labeled the omicron strain a \u201cvariant of concern\u201d on Friday when the Dow slid 900 points to suffer its worst day since October 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Covid symptoms linked to the omicron variant have been described as \u201cextremely mild\u201d by the South African doctor who first raised the alarm over the new strain. Still, the WHO said it will take weeks to understand how the variant may affect diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines.\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will tell the Senate Tuesday as part of his quarterly testimony on the pandemic that he believes that the omicron variant poses \u201cdownside risks to employment and economic activity.\u201d It also further complicates the inflation outlook, the Fed chief said in his prepared markets released Monday evening.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cGreater concerns about the virus could reduce people\u2019s willingness to work in person, which would slow progress in the labor market and intensify supply-chain disruptions,\u201d Powell will say.\n*****\n&gt; The CBOE volatility index, also known as the VIX or Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, declined during Monday\u2019s rally but still remained above 22. The gauge spiked 10 points above 28 at one point on Friday. The VIX was higher again on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis week will be instructive to see if the buy-the-dip approach by investors is still in play, or if markets are vulnerable to a more significant pullback,\u201d said Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/Kjg0zwO.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/aaRkgfQ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/q4uP0Vh.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Jml9Z5I.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/T3ao2E5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($LI $CRM $CRWD $DOCU $SNOW $AI $DG $MRVL $ZS $ASAN $OKTA $ULTA $AMBA $NTAP $SIG $EXPR $HPE $BBW $BQ $BNS $JKS $FRO $MOMO $HIBB $SPLK $SWBI $QH $RY $CHS $BZUN $FIVE $BOX $VERU $YJ $KR $CTRN $TD $VEEV $BIG $GMS $DOOO $CM $EMKR $PVH)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/5ocvp67.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($JKS $MOMO $BNS $CHS $BQ $BZUN $CTRN $RDHL $UCL $ARCE $SNEX $NVGS $WDH $GBDC $INFA $BFRI)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/j6KX8En.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/tjqxvE3.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/sugyIG5.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/wNc4EG0.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/rhobqci.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hrF7U5G.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/kLlwiak.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!]()**)\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* PPSI\n* HOOD\n* TGTX\n* TWTR\n* LUNA.X\n* ETH.X\n* REQ.X\n* IMGN\n* TIGR\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/30/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-regeneron-moderna-dollar-tree-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN)** \u2014 Regeneron shares fell more than 1% in the premarket after the company said its Covid-19 antibody cocktail and similar drugs could be less effective against the omicron Covid variant.

        "selftext": "# Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/smallstreetbets sub! Welcome to the new trading week and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, November 29th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Dow futures rebound by 200 points after Friday\u2019s big sell-off as investors reassess omicron risk](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/28/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n*****\n&gt; Stock futures pointed to a rebound following Friday\u2019s big sell-off, as investors monitor the latest developments related to the Covid omicron variant and assess its potential market impact.\n*****\n&gt; Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 210 points, or 0.6%. S&amp;P 500 futures added 0.8% and Nasdaq 100 futures rose about 0.9%.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks are coming off a holiday-shortened session Friday in which the Dow posted its worst day since October 2020. The Dow was down 905 points, or 2.5%. The S&amp;P 500 tumbled 2.3% and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 2.2%. The three major indexes were negative for the week.\n*****\n&gt; The World Health Organization on Friday labeled the omicron strain a \u201cvariant of concern.\u201d While scientists continue to research the variant, omicron\u2019s large number of mutations has raised alarm. Preliminary evidence suggests the strain has an increased risk of reinfection, according to the WHO. The variant was first reported to the WHO from South Africa and has been found in the U.K., Israel, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Australia and Hong Kong, but not yet in the U.S. Many countries, including the U.S., moved to restrict travel from southern Africa.\n*****\n&gt; The South African doctor who first raised the alarm over the new variant told the BBC that patients had \u201cextremely mild\u201d symptoms though it was too early to determine how omicron behaves before it is studied closely.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhile it is too early to have definitive data, early reported data suggest that the Omicron virus causes \u2018mild to moderate\u2019 symptoms (less severity) and is more transmissible,\u201d Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management tweeted Sunday evening. \u201cIf this turns out to be true, this is bullish not bearish for markets.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks that were the hardest hit on Friday were rebounding the most on Monday.\n*****\n&gt; Travel related stocks were up across the board. Carnival and Norwegian cruise lines were up more than 4% apiece in premarket trading. American, Delta and United airlines were up more than 2% each. Booking Holdings was up 2%. Boeing was up 1.7%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe would be aggressive buyers of this pullback,\u201d wrote Fundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee in a note to clients Sunday night. \u201cAs with the case for Beta and Delta variants, the \u2018bark\u2019 has proven worse than the bite in each of those precedent instances. The market carnage, in our view, will be short-lived and transitory.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield rebounded back above 1.5% after a flight to safety Friday sent investors scrambling into bonds and rates lower (Prices move inversely to yields). Bank of America, American Express and other financials gained on the rebound in yields.\n*****\n&gt; One stock that continued its Friday trend was Moderna. The vaccine maker\u2019s stock was up another 10% in premarket trading after jumping 20% on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Vaccine makers have announced measures to investigate omicron with testing already underway. While it remains to be seen how omicron responds to current vaccines or whether new formulations are required, Moderna\u2019s Chief Medical Officer Paul Burton said Sunday the vaccine maker could roll out a reformulated vaccine against the omicron variant early next year.\n*****\n&gt; Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge \u2014 the CBOE volatility index \u2014 was retreating again Monday after a 10-point spike on Friday. UBS looked at the last 17 times since 1990 when the VIX surged 10 points in a single day and found markets tended to snap back in the subsequent trading days. The S&amp;P 500 was higher by 2.5%, on average, the next trading day and 1.6% higher, on average, over the next week, UBS found.\n*****\n&gt; On top of Covid developments, investors are also anticipating key economic data released this week.\n*****\n&gt; The November jobs report on Friday is expected to show solid jobs growth.

Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Tuesday, November 30th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Dow futures are down more than 350 points as investors try to gauge the economic impact of omicron](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/29/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n&gt; Stock futures tumbled in early Tuesday trading, reversing a Monday rebound on Wall Street as investors reassessed risks associated with the new omicron Covid variant.\n*****\n&gt; Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 390 points, or 1.1%. S&amp;P 500 futures tumbled 0.9% and Nasdaq 100 futures shed 0.5%.\n*****\n&gt; The reversal came after Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel told the Financial Times that he expects existing vaccines to be less effective against the new variant. The CEO told the paper there could be a \u201cmaterial drop\u201d in the current vaccines\u2019 effectiveness against this variant. Bancel told CNBC on Monday that it could take months to develop and ship an omicron-specific vaccine.\n*****\n&gt; Separately, Regeneron said its antibody treatment may have reduced effectiveness against omicron. Regeneron shares lost 3% in premarket trading.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield fell further below 1.45% as investors worried about the economy slowing because of the new variant. The 10-year rate lost 9 basis points to 1.44% (1 basis point equals 0.01%). The yield on the 10-year Treasury was as high as 1.69% last week before Friday\u2019s drop below 1.5%.\n*****\n&gt; The futures move lower follows a volatile last few sessions as investors evaluate the omicron impact. The Dow lost 905 points on Friday, then rebounded by 237 points on Monday.\n*****\n&gt; Travel shares, which led Friday\u2019s drop and then gained on Monday, were taking hits once again in premarket trading Tuesday. Expedia Group fell 2.3%, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings tumbled 3.8% and American Airlines shares were off 3.3%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe have to expect...that the scenarios, all scenarios, include discoveries of people in this country with omicron and talk that the vaccines don\u2019t work or if they did those who have had Covid have no immunity,\u201d wrote CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer on Twitter Tuesday. \u201cThese all cause selling.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Some leading pharma stocks also took a hit, with Moderna getting the worst of it as the stock decreased 4.2%. Pfizer, however, was one of the few companies to post gains on the S&amp;P 500, rising 1.2%. Stay-at-home stock Netflix also rose, up 0.7% and videoconference leader Zoom saw shares climb 2.3%.\n*****\n&gt; Major averages rose to session highs on Monday after President Joe Biden said economic lockdowns are currently off the table and there will be no new travel restrictions.\n*****\n&gt; The new Covid variant, first detected in South Africa, has now been found in more than a dozen countries, causing many to restrict travel. The World Health Organization labeled the omicron strain a \u201cvariant of concern\u201d on Friday when the Dow slid 900 points to suffer its worst day since October 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Covid symptoms linked to the omicron variant have been described as \u201cextremely mild\u201d by the South African doctor who first raised the alarm over the new strain. Still, the WHO said it will take weeks to understand how the variant may affect diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines.\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will tell the Senate Tuesday as part of his quarterly testimony on the pandemic that he believes that the omicron variant poses \u201cdownside risks to employment and economic activity.\u201d It also further complicates the inflation outlook, the Fed chief said in his prepared markets released Monday evening.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cGreater concerns about the virus could reduce people\u2019s willingness to work in person, which would slow progress in the labor market and intensify supply-chain disruptions,\u201d Powell will say.\n*****\n&gt; The CBOE volatility index, also known as the VIX or Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, declined during Monday\u2019s rally but still remained above 22. The gauge spiked 10 points above 28 at one point on Friday. The VIX was higher again on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis week will be instructive to see if the buy-the-dip approach by investors is still in play, or if markets are vulnerable to a more significant pullback,\u201d said Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/Kjg0zwO.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/aaRkgfQ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/q4uP0Vh.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Jml9Z5I.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/T3ao2E5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($LI $CRM $CRWD $DOCU $SNOW $AI $DG $MRVL $ZS $ASAN $OKTA $ULTA $AMBA $NTAP $SIG $EXPR $HPE $BBW $BQ $BNS $JKS $FRO $MOMO $HIBB $SPLK $SWBI $QH $RY $CHS $BZUN $FIVE $BOX $VERU $YJ $KR $CTRN $TD $VEEV $BIG $GMS $DOOO $CM $EMKR $PVH)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/5ocvp67.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($JKS $MOMO $BNS $CHS $BQ $BZUN $CTRN $RDHL $UCL $ARCE $SNEX $NVGS $WDH $GBDC $INFA $BFRI)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/j6KX8En.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/tjqxvE3.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/sugyIG5.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/wNc4EG0.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/rhobqci.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hrF7U5G.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/kLlwiak.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!]()**)\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* PPSI\n* HOOD\n* TGTX\n* TWTR\n* LUNA.X\n* ETH.X\n* REQ.X\n* IMGN\n* TIGR\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/30/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-regeneron-moderna-dollar-tree-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN)** \u2014 Regeneron shares fell more than 1% in the premarket after the company said its Covid-19 antibody cocktail and similar drugs could be less effective against the omicron Covid variant.

        "selftext": "# Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to the new trading week and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, November 29th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Dow futures rebound by 200 points after Friday\u2019s big sell-off as investors reassess omicron risk](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/28/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n*****\n&gt; Stock futures pointed to a rebound following Friday\u2019s big sell-off, as investors monitor the latest developments related to the Covid omicron variant and assess its potential market impact.\n*****\n&gt; Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 210 points, or 0.6%. S&amp;P 500 futures added 0.8% and Nasdaq 100 futures rose about 0.9%.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks are coming off a holiday-shortened session Friday in which the Dow posted its worst day since October 2020. The Dow was down 905 points, or 2.5%. The S&amp;P 500 tumbled 2.3% and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 2.2%. The three major indexes were negative for the week.\n*****\n&gt; The World Health Organization on Friday labeled the omicron strain a \u201cvariant of concern.\u201d While scientists continue to research the variant, omicron\u2019s large number of mutations has raised alarm. Preliminary evidence suggests the strain has an increased risk of reinfection, according to the WHO. The variant was first reported to the WHO from South Africa and has been found in the U.K., Israel, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Australia and Hong Kong, but not yet in the U.S. Many countries, including the U.S., moved to restrict travel from southern Africa.\n*****\n&gt; The South African doctor who first raised the alarm over the new variant told the BBC that patients had \u201cextremely mild\u201d symptoms though it was too early to determine how omicron behaves before it is studied closely.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhile it is too early to have definitive data, early reported data suggest that the Omicron virus causes \u2018mild to moderate\u2019 symptoms (less severity) and is more transmissible,\u201d Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management tweeted Sunday evening. \u201cIf this turns out to be true, this is bullish not bearish for markets.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks that were the hardest hit on Friday were rebounding the most on Monday.\n*****\n&gt; Travel related stocks were up across the board. Carnival and Norwegian cruise lines were up more than 4% apiece in premarket trading. American, Delta and United airlines were up more than 2% each. Booking Holdings was up 2%. Boeing was up 1.7%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe would be aggressive buyers of this pullback,\u201d wrote Fundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee in a note to clients Sunday night. \u201cAs with the case for Beta and Delta variants, the \u2018bark\u2019 has proven worse than the bite in each of those precedent instances. The market carnage, in our view, will be short-lived and transitory.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield rebounded back above 1.5% after a flight to safety Friday sent investors scrambling into bonds and rates lower (Prices move inversely to yields). Bank of America, American Express and other financials gained on the rebound in yields.\n*****\n&gt; One stock that continued its Friday trend was Moderna. The vaccine maker\u2019s stock was up another 10% in premarket trading after jumping 20% on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Vaccine makers have announced measures to investigate omicron with testing already underway. While it remains to be seen how omicron responds to current vaccines or whether new formulations are required, Moderna\u2019s Chief Medical Officer Paul Burton said Sunday the vaccine maker could roll out a reformulated vaccine against the omicron variant early next year.\n*****\n&gt; Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge \u2014 the CBOE volatility index \u2014 was retreating again Monday after a 10-point spike on Friday. UBS looked at the last 17 times since 1990 when the VIX surged 10 points in a single day and found markets tended to snap back in the subsequent trading days. The S&amp;P 500 was higher by 2.5%, on average, the next trading day and 1.6% higher, on average, over the next week, UBS found.\n*****\n&gt; On top of Covid developments, investors are also anticipating key economic data released this week.\n*****\n&gt; The November jobs report on Friday is expected to show solid jobs growth. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect 581,000 jobs added in November. The Institute of Supply Management manufacturing survey is released Wednesday and economists also expect strong results.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe pandemic and COVID variants remain one of the biggest risks to markets, and are likely to continue to inject volatility over the next year(s). It\u2019s hard to say at this point how lasting or impactful this latest variant will be for markets,\u201d Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services, said in a note Friday.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/ISOlH6m.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ICn6AUF.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/b1c86w4.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Jml9Z5I.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/T3ao2E5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($LI $CRM $CRWD $DOCU $SNOW $AI $DG $MRVL $ZS $ASAN $OKTA $ULTA $AMBA $NTAP $SIG $EXPR $HPE $BBW $BQ $BNS $JKS $FRO $MOMO $HIBB $SPLK $SWBI $QH $RY $CHS $BZUN $FIVE $BOX $VERU $YJ $KR $CTRN $TD $VEEV $BIG $GMS $DOOO $CM $EMKR $PVH)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/5ocvp67.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($LI $FRO $YJ $QH)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/OkxZbaZ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/r4x7q0v.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/cx4jqmC.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES!](https://i.imgur.com/QA0QmDF.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/pMH4OQW.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!]()**)\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* NRXP\n* ATNF\n* BFRI\n* APDN\n* KRYS\n* LI\n* VXRT\n* BYSI\n* BIRD\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/29/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-moderna-carnival-zoom-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Moderna** \u2014 Shares of the vaccine maker continued their rally, jumping more than 11% in early morning trading Monday after gaining 20% on Friday.

The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting begins Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has averaged gains of 1.1% in November and 2.3% in December since 1936, notes Bank of America.

Shares of the electric automaker tumbled 5% premarket, though they are up 55% over just the past month.

It also raised its 2021 revenue and EPS outlook.\n*****\n&gt; Shares of materials giant DuPont de Nemours fell nearly 4% after the company said it is buying engineering materials technology maker Rogers Corp for $5.2 billion. DuPont also reported a 33% increase in adjusted third-quarter earnings.\n*****\n&gt; Under Armour shares soared nearly 10% after the athletic retailer hiked its annual outlook.\n*****\n&gt; On Monday, the Dow rose 94.3 points. The S&amp;P 500 rose nearly 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.6%. The small-cap Russell 2000 gained 2.7%, its best daily performance since August.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed at the conclusion of its two-day meeting on Wednesday is expected to announce it will begin unwinding its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases implemented during the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; The October jobs report is on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe November FOMC meeting, October payrolls ... and a host of earnings updates sets up a catalyst heavy week of trading ahead,\u201d Goldman Sachs\u2019 Chris Hussey said in a note.\n*****\n&gt; Better-than-expected corporate earnings results boosted the U.S. stock averages to finish October at record highs, with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq posting their best months since November 2020.\n*****\n&gt; As of Monday evening according to FactSet, 55.8% of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported quarterly financial results, with 82% beating earnings estimates.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/mbQdPjs.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vaORLAk.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/9Rrbjyg.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/uaTjkhx.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/bKWDopV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($SQ $PFE $ROKU $MRNA $PINS $ON $DKNG $UBER $APPS $QCOM $CRSR $PENN $SKLZ $PCG $CVS $TRVG $CRNT $ABNB $ATVI $MRO $MELI $DVN $FANG $BP $PTON $CGC $VIAC $AMG $FSLY $UAA $EPD $ET $NET $AKTS $ZG $GNRC $ALX $CNA $TMUS $SKC $RIG)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/HovAdxl.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($PFE $CRSR $BP $UAA $COP $GNRC $EPD $RACE $EL $MPC $LPX $ARCB $GPN $CTLT $RL $BLMN $MPLX $IDXX $NRZ $CMI $BHC $ZBRA $IT $MGY $ESPR $DD $KKR $APO $ETN $AME $MIME $ADCT $ROK $TECH $INCY $LIND $BCC $SAGE $LGIH $IEP $LEA)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/53VLxUW.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/LP69zIw.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/IWaFYUR.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/IA1HwBL.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/n7GayLd.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/h4f5OtE.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/ysSbo0i.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/ycH9aVx.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/zKN9CD3.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Mm0cU5s.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/M0Y7bN5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/poUGTRm.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/gE6O83n.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* TSLA\n* LRC.X\n* PFE\n* FSR\n* FCEL\n* CRSR\n* CHGG\n* DOT.X\n* VUZI\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/02/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-pfizer-under-armour-generac-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Pfizer (PFE)** \u2013 Pfizer jumped 4% in the premarket after the drugmaker reported better-than-expected profit and revenue for the third quarter.
