        "selftext": "Good morning, here's my watch list for today\n\nGap Ups: BLPH, BNTX, FLIR, IMMU, INO, JNUG/NUGT, NAT, NLS, SNBR,  ZM\n\nGap Downs: AYX, CROX, CTXS, HSY, PDD, STX, TGT\n\nEarnings season has officially started, in the near future we should start seeing some more opportunities than usual. As for today, pre market is flat while the SPY tries to make it's way over the 50 day moving average. As far as gappers go, there is a few but not many good ones that I like so I will be patient at open as yesterday was pretty choppy for the first hour or so until the market found direction. If SPY can break and hold over the 50 DMA, we have room to the 200 DMA which is currently at around 300. I feel repetitive saying this but due to the comments and messages I will continue to say it, always have a target and stop calculated Before you take any trades, this is important to eliminate emotions and give you an exit plan in case price moves against you. If you dn't use a target price then use a moving average or trend to capture profits. Good luck trading!",

        "selftext": "Good morning all. Here is my DD on some stonks. Google Doc didn't copy the links I attach to some of the statements so I guess you'll still have to find it on your own.\n\n$NAT - ($4.03) Nordic American Tankers Limited, a tanker company, acquires and charters double-hull tankers in Bermuda and internationally. It operates a fleet of 23 Suezmax crude oil tankers. A single suezmax carries about 800,000 to more than 1,000,000 barrels.\n\nNEWS:\nMay 18th Q1 Earning\nShare buy back program is decided March 18th\n\nCFO bought 60,000 shares @ $4.75 March 30th\nEVP bought 84,000 shares @ $3.37 March 25th \n(EVP is responsible for employing tankers)\nCEO\u2019s son bought 350,000 shares @ $2.92 March 24th\nNew Vice Chairman March 27th\nThey seem to release statements pretty frequently for the past 2 months.\n\nVolume: 2.9 million\n\nBALANCE:\nTotal assets just over $1 billion. \n(129 million in current assets)\n(62 million in cash)\n\nTotal liabilities $432 million\n(59 million in current liabilities, 375 million in long-term debt)\n(operating cost is $8,000 daily)\n\n*2019 the company was up 135% in accounts payable.\n\nINCOME:\n2019 Gross Profit 45 million.\nMore recently the CEO sent a letter showing 12 current contracts from March averaging $68,500 per day extending for the next 60 days.\nWith the current oil climate I expect demand for tankers to increase.\n\nAlso the CEO has made it clear: \u201cDividend are a priority\u201d as it mentioned in almost every article.\n\nSummary:\nIt's a go for me. This stock has seen better days at 20 million+ volume and prices well over $20. \u201808 crash they saw a positive bump and \u201815 they saw another one. Hoping the bump during this crash will be a spike.\nLooking for stock to double in Q2. Would be confident holding longer too. Going to be buying in Monday.\n\n\n$EROS - ($4.00) Eros International Plc, together with its subsidiaries, co-produces, acquires, and distributes Indian language films in various formats worldwide. News has it Eros will merge with STX Entertainment, a private company. Financial terms didn\u2019t come out, but I would assume STX would now operate in the public legal shell of Eros. Sometimes this works &amp; sometimes the deal doesn\u2019t go thru. Given the current market situation, STX might be using this as a quick play to go public \nTypically a merger can take 3-4 months.\n\nVolume: 20 million\n\n$EROS Balance Sheet:\nOver $1 billion in total assets\n\n430 million in liabilities, 200 million is current debt.\n\nINCOME: \n114 million Gross Profit but -400 million Net Income.\n\nOverall Eros has been on a downtrend from the start.\n\nSTX:\nSTX Entertainment was valued by multiple sources at $1.5 billion.\nThey made \u201cThe Upside\u201d with Kevin Hart. A movie I\u2019ve never heard about. Just watched the trailer, not sure what to think but let me guess, he dies at the end. $125 million box office. Budget 37.5 million.\n\nMile 22 - 66 million box office (lead role by Marky Mark!) budget 35 million. 21% on rotten tomatoes.\nUgly Dolls - 32 million box office. Budget 45 million. Most recent release/kids movie. 27% rotten tomatoes.\nThe Edge of 17 - 18 million box office. Budget was 9 million. 94% rotten tomatoes.\nThe Foreigner - 145 million box office. (Jackie Chan!) Budget 35 million.\n\nSummary:\nMost of their movies are profitable. Could be potential there but personally I\u2019m not a fan of any of these movies and I don\u2019t think Eros Bollywood audience will be either. \nHate to be the downer but this merger play just seems like a handful of hope.\nWho knows, maybe the merger goes well and the stock hits $16.79 by July.\n\n\n$TRNX- ($0.34) The company offers MagneGas, a hydrogen-based synthetic fuel that is used as an alternative to acetylene and other natural gas derived fuels for metal cutting and other commercial uses. It also provides Plasma Arc Flow System for MagneGas production, or water decontamination and sterilization. In addition, the company sells and licenses its proprietary plasma arc technology.\n\nNews:\nTaronis had previously been notified of a minimum bid deficiency, given relief until June 30th to hit $1.00.\nCompany decided against a reverse split! Good news, they must be confident! Could just be a pump tho right?\n\nVolume: 697 million\nThis has dummy momentum.\n\nHold on a second, this stock was once traded for $26,000???? I don\u2019t know about that. Look at the 5 year chart.\n\nBalance:\n27 million in assets, almost no cash.\n4 million in liabilities. \n\nIncome:\nGross profit: 8 million\nNet Income: -24 million\n\nSummary:\nThis company hasn\u2019t been profitable in years.\nNot liking the way these numbers are looking.\nRead rumors somewhere that Taronis Technology is licensing patents to Taronis Fuel. \nMaybe I\u2019m missing something here. It's a no go for me.\n\n$PUMP - ($3.50) (+25% on Friday) ProPetro Holding Corp., an oilfield services company, provides pressure pumping and other related services. The company offers hydraulic fracturing services; and a suite of well completion and production services, including cementing, acidizing, coiled tubing, flowback, surface air drilling, and drilling services. \nWhat struck my interest was oil field maintenance &amp; services. \n\nNews:\nEarning Date May 5th\nStockholder rights plan April 14th. Mentions the rights the shareholders would have if the company happens to get bought out in the next year. \nInvestigation on behalf of stockholders April 11th\n\nVolume: 3 million\n\nBalance:\n1.4 billion in total assets, 149 million cash.\n446 million total liabilities, 232 million current liabilities.\n\nIncome:\n436 million Gross Profit\n163 million Net Income\n\nSummary:\nI\u2019m already in at $3.34. Might get out before the earning date and get back in after.\n\n\nLASTLY: Buy $DECN\n\n*I'm aware this isn't the most diverse pick of stocks",

        "selftext": "This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.\nThe SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.

        "selftext": "Good morning, here's my watch list for today\n\nGap Ups: BLPH, BNTX, FLIR, IMMU, INO, JNUG/NUGT, NAT, NLS, SNBR,  ZM\n\nGap Downs: AYX, CROX, CTXS, HSY, PDD, STX, TGT\n\nEarnings season has officially started, in the near future we should start seeing some more opportunities than usual. As for today, pre market is flat while the SPY tries to make it's way over the 50 day moving average. As far as gappers go, there is a few but not many good ones that I like so I will be patient at open as yesterday was pretty choppy for the first hour or so until the market found direction. If SPY can break and hold over the 50 DMA, we have room to the 200 DMA which is currently at around 300. I feel repetitive saying this but due to the comments and messages I will continue to say it, always have a target and stop calculated Before you take any trades, this is important to eliminate emotions and give you an exit plan in case price moves against you. If you dn't use a target price then use a moving average or trend to capture profits. Good luck trading!",
