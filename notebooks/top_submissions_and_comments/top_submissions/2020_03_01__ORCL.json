        "selftext": "If you've paid any attention to the financial news over the last 2 years, you've seen the questions and critiques about Warren Buffett's cash position. In almost every interview he's asked why is he stacking cash or why Berkshire isn't outperforming the S&amp;P 500. The majority of questions aren't as brazen, but rewatch some of his interviews and you'll see that 1 or 2 questions along those lines comes up. \n\nTake this article by CNBC:\n\n*Being in the enviable position of having that much cash to spend seems unenviable at the moment, as far as Berkshire shareholders, and maybe even Buffett, are concerned. Buffett\u2019s company is currently on pace for its worst annual stock performance since 2009.*\n\n*\u201cHe pinned himself into a corner a few years ago, saying I can\u2019t have $150 billion in cash in three to four years and say that\u2019s alright,\u201d said Greggory Warren, a Morningstar analyst who covers Berkshire Hathaway.*\n\n*Underperformance versus the index, deals that have not worked out well, such as Kraft Heinz (thought it showed signs of life in its most recent earnings), and increasing willingness on Buffett\u2019s part to consider share buybacks, all point to the the importance of moving that cash into investments that generate a return.\"*\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/01/even-obvious-way-for-buffett-to-solve-big-cash-problem-is-a-puzzle.html\n\nI can spend all day finding each and every article from the past 2-3 years but you understand my point. \n\nAs stocks soared to all time highs, people wondered just as they did during the tech boom whether Buffett had lost his touch. Now Buffett is sitting on a 125+ Billion dollar mountain of cash just biding his time. He's poised more favorably than he could ever ask for, and prices are just getting more reasonable by the day.\n\nTLDR: When you see Buffett stacking cash, he's not an idiot. He's waiting for prices to become reasonable again, which only happens after a significant market decline. \n\nI'm not saying he's an oracle, but he's rarely wrong.",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week and month ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 9th, 2020.\n\n# **Wall Street braces for more market volatility as wild swings become the \u2018new normal\u2019 amid coronavirus  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/06/investors-brace-for-more-volatility-as-wild-swings-become-new-normal.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has never behaved like this, but Wall Street strategists say get used to it.\n*****\n&gt; Investors just witnessed the equity benchmark swinging up or down 2% for four days straight in the face of the coronavirus panic.\n*****\n&gt; In the index\u2019s history dating back to 1927, this is the first time the S&amp;P 500 had a week of alternating gains and losses of more than 2% from Monday through Thursday, according to Bespoke Investment Group. Daily swings like this over a two-week period were only seen at the peak of the financial crisis and in 2011 when U.S. sovereign debt got its first-ever downgrade, the firm said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe message to all investors is that they should expect this volatility to continue. This should be considered the new normal going forward,\u201d said Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy at E-Trade.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped north of 1,000 points twice in the past week, only to erase the quadruple-digit gains in the subsequent sessions. The coronavirus outbreak kept investors on edge as global cases of the infections surpassed 100,000. It\u2019s also spreading rapidly in the U.S. California has declared a state of emergency, while the number of cases in New York reached 33.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cUncertainty breeds greater market volatility,\u201d Keith Lerner, SunTrust\u2019s chief market strategist, said in a note. \u201cMuch is still unknown about how severe and widespread the coronavirus will become. From a market perspective, what we are seeing is uncomfortable but somewhat typical after shock periods.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # More stimulus?\n&gt; So far, the actions from global central banks and governments in response to the outbreak haven\u2019t triggered a sustainable rebound.\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve\u2019s first emergency rate cut since the financial crisis did little to calm investor anxiety. President Donald Trump on Friday signed a sweeping spending bill with an$8.3 billion packageto aid prevention efforts to produce a vaccine for the deadly disease, but stocks extended their heavy rout that day.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market is recognizing the global authorities are responding to this,\u201d said Tom Essaye, founder of the Sevens Report. \u201cIf the market begins to worry they are not doing that sufficiently, then I think we are going to go down ugly. It is helping stocks hold up.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Essaye said any further stimulus from China and a decent-sized fiscal package from Germany would be positive to the market, but he doesn\u2019t expect the moves to create a huge rebound.\n*****\n&gt; The fed funds future market is now pricing in the possibility of the U.S. central bank cutting by 75 basis points at its March 17-18 meeting.\n*****\n&gt; # Where is the bottom?\n&gt; Many on Wall Street expect the market to fall further before recovering as the health crisis unfolds.\n*****\n&gt; Binky Chadha, Deutsche Bank\u2019s chief equity strategist, sees a bottom for the S&amp;P 500 in the second quarter after stocks falling as much as 20% from their recent peak.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe magnitude of the selloff in the S&amp;P 500 so far has further to go; and in terms of duration, just two weeks in, it is much too early to declare this episode as being done,\u201d Chadha said in a note. \u201cWe do view the impacts on macro and earnings growth as being relatively short-lived and the market eventually looking through them.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Deutsche Bank maintained its year-end target of 3,250 for the S&amp;P 500, which would represent a 10% gain from here and a flat return for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists are also urging patience during this heightened volatility, cautioning against panic selling.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt is during times like these that investors need to maintain a longer-term perspective and stick to their investment process rather than making knee-jerk, binary decisions,\u201d Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/qgFoWQB.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7eQW0Js.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/mFotkBJ.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/XSXVPJQ.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/deKt8eq.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HYaxtrz.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/yygsO0C.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/oCNZNbl.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/4OOLYTY.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/y35bngj.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/E6twMcN.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ttAWeD2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/Dl7NlBA.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A \"Run of the Mill\" Drawdown\n\n&gt; If you're like us, you've heard a lot of people reference the recent equity declines as a sign that the market is pricing in some sort of Armageddon in the US economy. While comments like that make for great soundbites, a little perspective is in order. Since the S&amp;P 500's high on February 19th, the S&amp;P 500 is down 12.8%. In the chart below, we show the S&amp;P 500's annual maximum drawdown by year going back to 1928. In the entire history of the index, the median maximum drawdown from a YTD high is 13.05%. In other words, this year's decline is actually less than normal. Perhaps due to the fact that we have only seen one larger-than-average drawdown in the last eight years is why this one feels so bad.\n\n&gt; The fact that the current decline has only been inline with the historical norm raises a number of questions. For example, if the market has already priced in the worst-case scenario, going out and adding some equity exposure would be a no brainer. However, if we're only in the midst of a 'normal' drawdown in the equity market as the coronavirus outbreak threatens to put the economy into a recession, one could argue that things for the stock market could get worse before they get better, especially when we know that the market can be prone to over-reaction in both directions. The fact is that nobody knows right now how this entire outbreak will play out. If it really is a black swan, the market definitely has further to fall and now would present a great opportunity to sell more equities. However, if it proves to be temporary and after a quarter or two resolves itself and the economy gets back on the path it was on at the start of the year, then the magnitude of the current decline is probably appropriate. As they say, that's what makes a market!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Drawdowns.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Long-Term Treasuries Go Haywire\n\n&gt; Take a good luck at today's moves in long-term US Treasury yields, because chances are you won't see moves of this magnitude again soon. Let's start with the yield on the 30-year US Treasury. Today's decline of 29 basis points in the yield will go down as the largest one-day decline in the yield on the 30-year since 2009. For some perspective, there have only been 25 other days since 1977 where the yield saw a larger one day decline.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Change.png))**\n\n&gt; That doesn't even tell the whole story, though. As shown in the chart below, every other time the yield saw a sharper one-day decline, the actual yield of the 30-year was much higher, and in most other cases it was much, much higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Yield.png))**\n\n&gt; To show this another way, the percentage change in the yield on the 30-year has never been seen before, and it's not even close. Now, before the chart crime police come calling, we realize showing a percentage change of a percentage is not the most accurate representation, but we wanted to show this for illustrative purposes only.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Percent-change-in-yield.png))**\n\n&gt; Finally, with long-term interest rates plummetting we wanted to provide an update on the performance of the Austrian 100-year bond. That's now back at record highs, begging the question, why is the US not flooding the market with long-term debt?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Austria.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# It Doesn't Get Much Worse Than This For Crude Oil\n\n&gt; Crude oil prices are down close to 10% today in what is shaping up to be the worst day for crude oil since late 2014. That's more than five years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Crude-Oil-Daily-Changes.png))**\n\n&gt; Today's decline is pretty much a continuation of what has been a one-way trade for the commodity ever since the US drone strike on Iranian general Soleimani. The last time prices were this low was around Christmas 2018.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Crude-Oil.png))**\n\n&gt; With today's decline, crude oil is now off to its worst start to a year in a generation falling 32%. Since 1984, the only other year that was worse was 1986 when the year started out with a decline of 50% through March 6th. If you're looking for a bright spot, in 1986, prices rose 36% over the remainder of the year. The only other year where crude oil kicked off the year with a 30% decline was in 1991 after the first Iraq war. Over the remainder of that year, prices rose a more modest 5%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Crude-Oil-YTD-Starts.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# 10-Year Treasury Yield Breaks Below 1%\n\n&gt; Despite strong market gains on Wednesday, March 4, 2020, the on-the-run 10-year Treasury yield ended the day below 1% for the first time ever and has posted additional declines in real time, sitting at 0.92% intraday as this blog is being written. \u201cThe decline in yields has been remarkable,\u201d said LPL Research Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThe 10-year Treasury yield has dipped below 1%, and today\u2019s declines are likely to make the recent run lower the largest decline of the cycle.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in LPL Research\u2019s chart of the day, the current decline in the 10-year Treasury yield without a meaningful reversal (defined as at least 0.75%) is approaching the decline seen in 2011 and 2012 and would need about another two months to be the longest decline in length of time. At the same time, no prior decline has lasted forever and a pattern of declines and increases has been normal.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Blog-chart-3.5.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; What are some things that can push the 10-year Treasury yield lower?\n\n&gt; * A shrinking but still sizable yield advantage over other developed market sovereign debt\n&gt; * Added stock volatility if downside risks to economic growth from the coronavirus increase\n&gt; * A larger potential premium over shorter-term yields if the Federal Reserve aggressively cuts interest rates\n\n&gt; What are some things that can push the 10-year Treasury yield higher?\n\n&gt; * A second half economic rebound acting a catalyst for a Treasury sell-off\n&gt; * As yields move lower, investors may increasingly seek more attractive sources of income\n&gt; * Any dollar weakness could lead to some selling by international investors\n&gt; * Longer maturity Treasuries are looking like an increasingly crowded trade, potentially adding energy to any sell-off\n\n&gt; On balance, our view remains that the prospect of an economic rebound over the second half points to the potential for interest rates moving higher. At the same time, we still see some advantage in the potential diversification benefits of intermediate maturity high-quality bonds, especially during periods of market stress. We continue to recommend that suitable investors consider keeping a bond portfolio\u2019s sensitivity to changes in interest rates below that of the benchmark Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index by emphasizing short to intermediate maturity bonds, but do not believe it\u2019s time to pile into very short maturities despite the 10-year Treasury yield sitting at historically low levels.\n\n*****\n\n# U.S. Jobs Growth Marches On\n\n&gt; While stock markets continue to be extremely volatile as they come to terms with how the coronavirus may affect global growth, the U.S. job market has remained remarkably robust. Continued U.S. jobs data resilience in the face of headwinds from the coronavirus outbreak may be a key factor in prolonging the expansion, given how important the strength of the U.S. consumer has been late into this expansion.\n\n&gt; The U.S. Department of Labor today reported that U.S. nonfarm payroll data had a strong showing of 273,000 jobs added in February, topping the expectation of every Bloomberg-surveyed economist, with an additional upward revision of 85,000 additional jobs for December 2019 and January 2020. This has brought the current unemployment rate back to its 50-year low of 3.5%. So far, it appears it\u2019s too soon for any effects of the coronavirus to have been felt in the jobs numbers. (Note: The survey takes place in the middle of each month.)\n\n&gt; On Wednesday, ADP released its private payroll data (excluding government jobs), which increased by 183,000 in February, also handily beating market expectations. Most of these jobs were added in the service sector, with 44,000 added in the leisure and hospitality sector, and another 31,000 in trade/transportation/utilities. Both of these areas could be at risk of potential cutbacks if consumers start to avoid eating out or other leisure pursuits due to coronavirus fears.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, payrolls remain strong, and any effects of the virus outbreaks most likely would be felt in coming months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/US-Jobs-Data.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cFebruary\u2019s jobs report shows the 113th straight month that the U.S. jobs market has grown,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThat\u2019s an incredible run and highlights how the U.S. consumer has become key to extending the expansion, especially given setbacks to global growth from the coronavirus outbreak.\u201d\n\n&gt; While there is bound to be some drag on future jobs data from the coronavirus-related slowdown, we would anticipate that the effects of this may be transitory. We believe economic fundamentals continue to suggest the possibility of a second-half-of-the\u2013year economic rebound.\n\n*****\n\n# Down January &amp; Down February: S&amp;P 500 Posts Full-Year Gain Just 43.75% of Time\n\n&gt; The combination of a down January and a down February has come about 17 times, including this year, going back to 1950. Rest of the year and full-year performance has taken a rather sizable hit following the previous 16 occurrences. March through December S&amp;P 500 average performance drops to 2.32% compared to 7.69% in all years. Full-year performance is even worse with S&amp;P 500 average turning to a loss of 4.91% compared to an average gain of 9.14% in all years. All hope for 2020 is not lost as seven of the 16 past down January and down February years did go on to log gains over the last 10 months and full year while six enjoyed double-digit gains from March to December.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/781e034df22d242349ff3f8882653cec/b4f07d98317a2635-4d/s500x750/0ea61b1c01085e74593633995acba59fe8a96ce8.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Take Caution After Emergency Rate Cut\n\n&gt; Today\u2019s big rally was an encouraging sign that the markets are becoming more comfortable with the public health, monetary and political handling of the situation. But the history of these \u201cemergency\u201d or \u201csurprise\u201d rate cuts by the Fed between meetings suggest some caution remains in order.\n\n&gt; The table here shows that these surprise cuts between meetings have really only \u201cworked\u201d once in the past 20+ years. In 1998 when the Fed and the plunge protection team acted swiftly and in a coordinated manner to stave off the fallout from the financial crisis caused by the collapse of the Russian ruble and the highly leveraged Long Term Capital Management hedge fund markets responded well. This was not the case during the extended bear markets of 2001-2002 and 2007-2009.\n\n&gt; Bottom line: if this is a short-term impact like the 1998 financial crisis the market should recover sooner rather than later. But if the economic impact of coronavirus virus is prolonged, the market is more likely to languish.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fd9ae8723eaf077f8baa56e384c8d8f7/e543b6eee32cdf93-81/s500x750/0f2b63108953c1e4cfb97da0a979d4ab3651cdeb.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$ADBE** \n&gt; * **$DKS**\n&gt; * **$AVGO** \n&gt; * **$THO** \n&gt; * **$ULTA** \n&gt; * **$WORK** \n&gt; * **$DG** \n&gt; * **$SFIX** \n&gt; * **$SOGO** \n&gt; * **$DOCU** \n&gt; * **$INO** \n&gt; * **$CLDR** \n&gt; * **$INSG** \n&gt; * **$SOHU** \n&gt; * **$BTAI** \n&gt; * **$ORCL** \n&gt; * **$HEAR** \n&gt; * **$NVAX** \n&gt; * **$ADDYY** \n&gt; * **$GPS** \n&gt; * **$AKBA** \n&gt; * **$PDD** \n&gt; * **$CYOU** \n&gt; * **$FNV** \n&gt; * **$MTNB** \n&gt; * **$NERV** \n&gt; * **$MTN** \n&gt; * **$BEST** \n&gt; * **$PRTY** \n&gt; * **$NINE** \n&gt; * **$AZUL** \n&gt; * **$UNFI** \n&gt; * **$PRPL** \n&gt; * **$VSLR** \n&gt; * **$KLZE** \n&gt; * **$ZUO** \n&gt; * **$DVAX** \n&gt; * **$EXPR** \n&gt; * **$VRA** \n&gt; * **$AXSM** \n&gt; * **$CDMO** \n&gt; * **$CASY**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/4OOLYTY.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MY5URDI.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.9.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Fq1ixYG.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3QxCDMd.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.10.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/kG5Cja7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SWb2ADY.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.11.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SH8bsTn.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PH2Inly.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RToRF8p.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HECD2g3.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.13.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BvEJ9Vw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.13.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Inc. $336.77\n&gt; **Adobe Inc.

It\u2019s also spreading rapidly in the U.S. California has declared a state of emergency, while the number of cases in New York reached 33.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cUncertainty breeds greater market volatility,\u201d Keith Lerner, SunTrust\u2019s chief market strategist, said in a note. \u201cMuch is still unknown about how severe and widespread the coronavirus will become. From a market perspective, what we are seeing is uncomfortable but somewhat typical after shock periods.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; More stimulus?\n&gt; So far, the actions from global central banks and governments in response to the outbreak haven\u2019t triggered a sustainable rebound.\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve\u2019s first emergency rate cut since the financial crisis did little to calm investor anxiety. President Donald Trump on Friday signed a sweeping spending bill with an$8.3 billion packageto aid prevention efforts to produce a vaccine for the deadly disease, but stocks extended their heavy rout that day.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market is recognizing the global authorities are responding to this,\u201d said Tom Essaye, founder of the Sevens Report. \u201cIf the market begins to worry they are not doing that sufficiently, then I think we are going to go down ugly. It is helping stocks hold up.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Essaye said any further stimulus from China and a decent-sized fiscal package from Germany would be positive to the market, but he doesn\u2019t expect the moves to create a huge rebound.\n*****\n&gt; The fed funds future market is now pricing in the possibility of the U.S. central bank cutting by 75 basis points at its March 17-18 meeting.\n*****\n&gt; Where is the bottom?\n&gt; Many on Wall Street expect the market to fall further before recovering as the health crisis unfolds.\n*****\n&gt; Binky Chadha, Deutsche Bank\u2019s chief equity strategist, sees a bottom for the S&amp;P 500 in the second quarter after stocks falling as much as 20% from their recent peak.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe magnitude of the selloff in the S&amp;P 500 so far has further to go; and in terms of duration, just two weeks in, it is much too early to declare this episode as being done,\u201d Chadha said in a note. \u201cWe do view the impacts on macro and earnings growth as being relatively short-lived and the market eventually looking through them.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Deutsche Bank maintained its year-end target of 3,250 for the S&amp;P 500, which would represent a 10% gain from here and a flat return for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists are also urging patience during this heightened volatility, cautioning against panic selling.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt is during times like these that investors need to maintain a longer-term perspective and stick to their investment process rather than making knee-jerk, binary decisions,\u201d Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/qgFoWQB.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7eQW0Js.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/mFotkBJ.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/XSXVPJQ.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/deKt8eq.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HYaxtrz.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/yygsO0C.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/oCNZNbl.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/4OOLYTY.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/y35bngj.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/E6twMcN.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ttAWeD2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/Dl7NlBA.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A \"Run of the Mill\" Drawdown\n\n&gt; If you're like us, you've heard a lot of people reference the recent equity declines as a sign that the market is pricing in some sort of Armageddon in the US economy. While comments like that make for great soundbites, a little perspective is in order. Since the S&amp;P 500's high on February 19th, the S&amp;P 500 is down 12.8%. In the chart below, we show the S&amp;P 500's annual maximum drawdown by year going back to 1928. In the entire history of the index, the median maximum drawdown from a YTD high is 13.05%. In other words, this year's decline is actually less than normal. Perhaps due to the fact that we have only seen one larger-than-average drawdown in the last eight years is why this one feels so bad.\n\n&gt; The fact that the current decline has only been inline with the historical norm raises a number of questions. For example, if the market has already priced in the worst-case scenario, going out and adding some equity exposure would be a no brainer. However, if we're only in the midst of a 'normal' drawdown in the equity market as the coronavirus outbreak threatens to put the economy into a recession, one could argue that things for the stock market could get worse before they get better, especially when we know that the market can be prone to over-reaction in both directions. The fact is that nobody knows right now how this entire outbreak will play out. If it really is a black swan, the market definitely has further to fall and now would present a great opportunity to sell more equities. However, if it proves to be temporary and after a quarter or two resolves itself and the economy gets back on the path it was on at the start of the year, then the magnitude of the current decline is probably appropriate. As they say, that's what makes a market!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Drawdowns.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Long-Term Treasuries Go Haywire\n\n&gt; Take a good luck at today's moves in long-term US Treasury yields, because chances are you won't see moves of this magnitude again soon. Let's start with the yield on the 30-year US Treasury. Today's decline of 29 basis points in the yield will go down as the largest one-day decline in the yield on the 30-year since 2009. For some perspective, there have only been 25 other days since 1977 where the yield saw a larger one day decline.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Change.png))**\n\n&gt; That doesn't even tell the whole story, though. As shown in the chart below, every other time the yield saw a sharper one-day decline, the actual yield of the 30-year was much higher, and in most other cases it was much, much higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Yield.png))**\n\n&gt; To show this another way, the percentage change in the yield on the 30-year has never been seen before, and it's not even close. Now, before the chart crime police come calling, we realize showing a percentage change of a percentage is not the most accurate representation, but we wanted to show this for illustrative purposes only.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Percent-change-in-yield.png))**\n\n&gt; Finally, with long-term interest rates plummetting we wanted to provide an update on the performance of the Austrian 100-year bond. That's now back at record highs, begging the question, why is the US not flooding the market with long-term debt?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Austria.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# It Doesn't Get Much Worse Than This For Crude Oil\n\n&gt; Crude oil prices are down close to 10% today in what is shaping up to be the worst day for crude oil since late 2014. That's more than five years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Crude-Oil-Daily-Changes.png))**\n\n&gt; Today's decline is pretty much a continuation of what has been a one-way trade for the commodity ever since the US drone strike on Iranian general Soleimani. The last time prices were this low was around Christmas 2018.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Crude-Oil.png))**\n\n&gt; With today's decline, crude oil is now off to its worst start to a year in a generation falling 32%. Since 1984, the only other year that was worse was 1986 when the year started out with a decline of 50% through March 6th. If you're looking for a bright spot, in 1986, prices rose 36% over the remainder of the year. The only other year where crude oil kicked off the year with a 30% decline was in 1991 after the first Iraq war. Over the remainder of that year, prices rose a more modest 5%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Crude-Oil-YTD-Starts.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# 10-Year Treasury Yield Breaks Below 1%\n\n&gt; Despite strong market gains on Wednesday, March 4, 2020, the on-the-run 10-year Treasury yield ended the day below 1% for the first time ever and has posted additional declines in real time, sitting at 0.92% intraday as this blog is being written. \u201cThe decline in yields has been remarkable,\u201d said LPL Research Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThe 10-year Treasury yield has dipped below 1%, and today\u2019s declines are likely to make the recent run lower the largest decline of the cycle.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in LPL Research\u2019s chart of the day, the current decline in the 10-year Treasury yield without a meaningful reversal (defined as at least 0.75%) is approaching the decline seen in 2011 and 2012 and would need about another two months to be the longest decline in length of time. At the same time, no prior decline has lasted forever and a pattern of declines and increases has been normal.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Blog-chart-3.5.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; What are some things that can push the 10-year Treasury yield lower?\n\n&gt; * A shrinking but still sizable yield advantage over other developed market sovereign debt\n&gt; * Added stock volatility if downside risks to economic growth from the coronavirus increase\n&gt; * A larger potential premium over shorter-term yields if the Federal Reserve aggressively cuts interest rates\n\n&gt; What are some things that can push the 10-year Treasury yield higher?\n\n&gt; * A second half economic rebound acting a catalyst for a Treasury sell-off\n&gt; * As yields move lower, investors may increasingly seek more attractive sources of income\n&gt; * Any dollar weakness could lead to some selling by international investors\n&gt; * Longer maturity Treasuries are looking like an increasingly crowded trade, potentially adding energy to any sell-off\n\n&gt; On balance, our view remains that the prospect of an economic rebound over the second half points to the potential for interest rates moving higher. At the same time, we still see some advantage in the potential diversification benefits of intermediate maturity high-quality bonds, especially during periods of market stress. We continue to recommend that suitable investors consider keeping a bond portfolio\u2019s sensitivity to changes in interest rates below that of the benchmark Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index by emphasizing short to intermediate maturity bonds, but do not believe it\u2019s time to pile into very short maturities despite the 10-year Treasury yield sitting at historically low levels.\n\n*****\n\n# U.S. Jobs Growth Marches On\n\n&gt; While stock markets continue to be extremely volatile as they come to terms with how the coronavirus may affect global growth, the U.S. job market has remained remarkably robust. Continued U.S. jobs data resilience in the face of headwinds from the coronavirus outbreak may be a key factor in prolonging the expansion, given how important the strength of the U.S. consumer has been late into this expansion.\n\n&gt; The U.S. Department of Labor today reported that U.S. nonfarm payroll data had a strong showing of 273,000 jobs added in February, topping the expectation of every Bloomberg-surveyed economist, with an additional upward revision of 85,000 additional jobs for December 2019 and January 2020. This has brought the current unemployment rate back to its 50-year low of 3.5%. So far, it appears it\u2019s too soon for any effects of the coronavirus to have been felt in the jobs numbers. (Note: The survey takes place in the middle of each month.)\n\n&gt; On Wednesday, ADP released its private payroll data (excluding government jobs), which increased by 183,000 in February, also handily beating market expectations. Most of these jobs were added in the service sector, with 44,000 added in the leisure and hospitality sector, and another 31,000 in trade/transportation/utilities. Both of these areas could be at risk of potential cutbacks if consumers start to avoid eating out or other leisure pursuits due to coronavirus fears.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, payrolls remain strong, and any effects of the virus outbreaks most likely would be felt in coming months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/US-Jobs-Data.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cFebruary\u2019s jobs report shows the 113th straight month that the U.S. jobs market has grown,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThat\u2019s an incredible run and highlights how the U.S. consumer has become key to extending the expansion, especially given setbacks to global growth from the coronavirus outbreak.\u201d\n\n&gt; While there is bound to be some drag on future jobs data from the coronavirus-related slowdown, we would anticipate that the effects of this may be transitory. We believe economic fundamentals continue to suggest the possibility of a second-half-of-the\u2013year economic rebound.\n\n*****\n\n# Down January &amp; Down February: S&amp;P 500 Posts Full-Year Gain Just 43.75% of Time\n\n&gt; The combination of a down January and a down February has come about 17 times, including this year, going back to 1950. Rest of the year and full-year performance has taken a rather sizable hit following the previous 16 occurrences. March through December S&amp;P 500 average performance drops to 2.32% compared to 7.69% in all years. Full-year performance is even worse with S&amp;P 500 average turning to a loss of 4.91% compared to an average gain of 9.14% in all years. All hope for 2020 is not lost as seven of the 16 past down January and down February years did go on to log gains over the last 10 months and full year while six enjoyed double-digit gains from March to December.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/781e034df22d242349ff3f8882653cec/b4f07d98317a2635-4d/s500x750/0ea61b1c01085e74593633995acba59fe8a96ce8.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Take Caution After Emergency Rate Cut\n\n&gt; Today\u2019s big rally was an encouraging sign that the markets are becoming more comfortable with the public health, monetary and political handling of the situation. But the history of these \u201cemergency\u201d or \u201csurprise\u201d rate cuts by the Fed between meetings suggest some caution remains in order.\n\n&gt; The table here shows that these surprise cuts between meetings have really only \u201cworked\u201d once in the past 20+ years. In 1998 when the Fed and the plunge protection team acted swiftly and in a coordinated manner to stave off the fallout from the financial crisis caused by the collapse of the Russian ruble and the highly leveraged Long Term Capital Management hedge fund markets responded well. This was not the case during the extended bear markets of 2001-2002 and 2007-2009.\n\n&gt; Bottom line: if this is a short-term impact like the 1998 financial crisis the market should recover sooner rather than later. But if the economic impact of coronavirus virus is prolonged, the market is more likely to languish.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fd9ae8723eaf077f8baa56e384c8d8f7/e543b6eee32cdf93-81/s500x750/0f2b63108953c1e4cfb97da0a979d4ab3651cdeb.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending March 6th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WonBP-yE0EI&amp;t=2s))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 3.8.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xpc7iemBajE))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$ADBE** \n&gt; * **$DKS**\n&gt; * **$AVGO** \n&gt; * **$THO** \n&gt; * **$ULTA** \n&gt; * **$WORK** \n&gt; * **$DG** \n&gt; * **$SFIX** \n&gt; * **$SOGO** \n&gt; * **$DOCU** \n&gt; * **$INO** \n&gt; * **$CLDR** \n&gt; * **$INSG** \n&gt; * **$SOHU** \n&gt; * **$BTAI** \n&gt; * **$ORCL** \n&gt; * **$HEAR** \n&gt; * **$NVAX** \n&gt; * **$ADDYY** \n&gt; * **$GPS** \n&gt; * **$AKBA** \n&gt; * **$PDD** \n&gt; * **$CYOU** \n&gt; * **$FNV** \n&gt; * **$MTNB** \n&gt; * **$NERV** \n&gt; * **$MTN** \n&gt; * **$BEST** \n&gt; * **$PRTY** \n&gt; * **$NINE** \n&gt; * **$AZUL** \n&gt; * **$UNFI** \n&gt; * **$PRPL** \n&gt; * **$VSLR** \n&gt; * **$KLZE** \n&gt; * **$ZUO** \n&gt; * **$DVAX** \n&gt; * **$EXPR** \n&gt; * **$VRA** \n&gt; * **$AXSM** \n&gt; * **$CDMO** \n&gt; * **$CASY**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/4OOLYTY.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MY5URDI.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.9.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Fq1ixYG.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3QxCDMd.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.10.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/kG5Cja7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SWb2ADY.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.11.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SH8bsTn.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PH2Inly.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RToRF8p.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HECD2g3.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.13.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BvEJ9Vw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.13.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Inc. $336.77\n&gt; **Adobe Inc.

        "selftext": "\nThis is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.\nThe SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.\n\n## Largest Insider Buying (Last 7 Days)\nCompany|Count|Shares Changed|Avg.

I was invited because a Swiss investment group provided seed funding for my company, and they had a few events there. It was a fun, strange time. I had Nouriel Roubini yell at me about crypto being a scam, mistook Robert Shiller for a waiter (he looked good in his tux), and talked with Mr. Solomon - DJ D-Sol - about his career as a DJ, without knowing who he was.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, lot of people in Davos were scared about the Coronavirus, but they're all even more scared about debt. Bankers are terrified because a debt crisis is coming, and no one has any idea what to do about it. All the tools in the toolbox are broken, and all the nuts that can be tightened are nearly stripped. There is no plan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started reading more about the repo market, the debt crisis we're in, and how this beer virus is compounding this. We're pretty fucked - so we may as well get some tendies out of the whole mess. I can't explain the gravity of the situation to you with you reading the reading list below. Skim through the articles and see what interests you, and then read the ones that sound scariest to you.

I have to come out, not as gay, but as 16. Who knows which is worse. Despite how you may disagree after clicking on the link a line below this one, I would call myself a good trader, just an insanely greedy one. Anyways, after doing [this](https://imgur.com/a/ZF9SqAe) to my account in 4 trading days, I realize how bad my gambling addiction has become, and how much I love this shit. I told myself \"dont take profit until your account balance has a 2 in front, and that option says 500% p/l. It was in the 480's when I took that photo. For being 16, that is a shit ton of money. \n\nAnyways, Ill get on with it. You guys tell me what to trade, I do it. This WILL NOT be another CTN, I will make my own trades if you guys say some dumb shit. Ill provide daily updates, and if its looking nice, hell, maybe it will go public one day. \n\nI find myself pretty good (overall) with daytrades, but holding anything over the weekend will fuck me. That's where I want your guys's help. Also, betting against the fed is typically a very bad idea. \n\nCurrently, my account is fucked.  I'm pulling the rest of the $200 out of my Fido, and putting it in here, which will be getting YOLO'd.  I have another 200 waiting on my Paypal, so that will help save my account\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, if spy closes below $300 tomorrow, well, check my recent comments. It will save my account, and lets just say that I will be giving back. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: LONG WSBX (WSBXXX COMING SOON)",

        "selftext": "**How To GET PAID $2,000 Drop Servicing \\[Get Your High Ticket Client\\]**\n\nA big question I always get from students is how do I get clients to pay me. There\u2019s a few main things to focus on with this. Other than these points it\u2019s all about simply choosing your ideal platform and sending the invoice. Before you do that though, make sure you have these things in place so you don\u2019t run into the major issues I\u2019m about to expose.\n\n**How To Deal With Clients That Don\u2019t Want To Pay**\n\nAlways make sure that you don\u2019t deliver the finished product until the client has paid in full. I\u2019ve had a few experiences in the past where a client hasn\u2019t paid on time which led us not getting paid in full or not getting paid on time. The best way to deal with those who refuse to pay is to either require them to pay 100% up front before working with you or if you go for the 50% up front and 50% on delivery option, at least ensure you never deliver the final product, add your logo to it if it\u2019s something like a video, keep everything on your systems if it\u2019s something like a website.\n\n**How To Get High Paying clients**\n\nRealize your working in an abundant market, there are too many potential clients for you to possibly be able to service them all. There\u2019s plenty of fish in the sea, so you don\u2019t need to be desperate in taking whatever you can get someone to pay you. It all comes down to knowing what your service is worth in the market and charging what you deserve to be paid. If you\u2019re skilled in conveying your worth to clients in relation to a problem they really need to solve right now while you are the very best option to solve that problem then they\u2019re going to be willing to spend very large amounts to get that problem solved. On top of that you need to remember it\u2019s nothing for these companies to spend thousands with you, it\u2019s only a big deal for you if you\u2019re not used to it yet.\n\n**How Should Clients Pay Me**\n\nI\u2019ve heard of all kinds of strange payment structures over the years with all kinda of weird explanations for each. At the end of the day you should only get clients to pay you 100% up front or 50% up front, 50% on delivery if they really push on it. Personally, I only take this second option if the sales is worth at least $2,000 otherwise it\u2019s just not worth the time of going through two sets of receiving payments. The biggest thing is feeling comfortable asking for 100% payment upfront.\n\n**Payment Methods**\n\nThere\u2019s so many platforms out there for accepting payment all of which take some kind of fee. PayPal and Stripe make things simple but they both lead to higher fees expecting payments especially if your bank currency is different to the one you accept payment in. Bank transfer is another option but it can be slower to make happen and asks a bit more of the potential client when making payment as it\u2019s simply a little more work for them but if going this route I recommend using Transferwise to save massively on fees. It\u2019s really going to be a decision between minimizing fees or minimizing the time investment in your client making the payment, all dependent on your preferences in the end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Click HERE to learn more](https://youtu.be/hCCnhRKQw_0)",

They had an uplift on Friday but bad news during the weekend will probably destroy the gains on Monday. I got in at 80$/share, would it be smart to realize the earnings now and get back into it?",
