        "selftext": "The Future Fund is exactly what it sounds like. They invest in whatever some old guy thinks is \"the future\" of technology. Predictably, they hold a mix of meme stocks, FANG stocks, and overpriced innovative startups.\n\nThis might sound like an irrelevant stock for this sub, but the manager Gary Black has very publicly said that Tesla stock is \"still cheap.\" And if that's not cognitive dissonance, I don't know what is. Because in case you haven't been reading about markets, Tesla has come within single digits of bankruptcy many times in the last year, SpaceX almost certainly will run out of money within a year, they struggle to turn a profit, and even if they replaced every auto maker in the US they'd still have an unacceptably high PE ratio.\n\nIt shouldn't surprise you that highly speculative investing brings out the dumbest behaviors in the smartest people. FFND has over 10% of its money in Tesla, and if something were to happen like Mr Musk dying in a car crash, cascading failures will occur as the losses cause capital flight from FFND forcing them to sell at a loss, and since they bought the same stocks as other innovative ETFs these stocks will causes losses on each other.\n\nFFND isn't a zero, however, as it still holds a diversified portfolio, most of which are solid companies (like Alphabet, Chipotle, and PayPal). But again this is an actively managed fund, and if anything men like us all have in common it's we often turn good stocks into bad trades by constantly tinkering and timing portfolios even when it makes no sense. The expense ratio for this stock is also a full 1%, a number which doesn't include how it's third largest position is a high-growth ETF.\n\nSo, puts on Gar Black's portfolio.\n\nDisclaimer: I have no position at this time and am unsure if I will get a position.",

        "selftext": "I've gotten lucky with options trading recently and realized some good gains with puts. I've bought slightly OTM puts on mega caps PYPL and TWTR, anticipating dips that both happened. These were risky plays and essentially wagers, so I'd like some input on risk management moving forward.\n\nI understand the basics of the greeks and understand the importance of IV, but want to know how these translate into picking options for scalping intra-day price movement. \n\nHere's the jist of the strategy I have been employing thus far:\n\nChoose tickers with clear intra-day trends in price i.e. no seesawing or sideways price movement. Rallies have support and selloffs occur continously with little to no pullback. The other day I experimented with a single put contract on DIS which I unfortunately bought at the rock bottom of a morning selloff only to watch it rebound with virtually no resistance for nearly the remainder of the day. While I lost money on that trade this is the kind of behavior I am looking for. \n\nTicker has volume on the option and strike and narrow bid ask. \n\nBuy slightly OTM puts, no more than 1 or 2 strike prices away from ITM. Buy with a 2 week expiry so that if SHTF I have time for some recovery. Use virtually 100% of my capital on each position I take. Sell once the strike price is reached\n\nBuy on days with clear market-wide trends like the omicron panic sell. \n\nClose the position within a few hours of opening it. I prefer to watch market open for about an hour before deciding if a trend is emerging. I try to avoid plays during power hour. Never hold overnight to avoid surprises.\n\nQuestions:\n\nI have not yet set limits on my options, I realized a 50% loss on the DIS position and am aware of the significant downside of this strategy. What is a sensible limit to set on my gain/loss? I have realized up to 25% before closing, but at that point was getting nervous with the amount of capital on the line.\n\nHow quickly can IV change? I have no intention of playing earnings nor buying on a flat day anticipating movement. I check historical IV charts and the IV for the options I am eyeing but it is not yet clear to me how rugpulled I could get if the stock decides to stop moving. \n\nFrom my understanding of the greeks, I am making most of my gains from delta. I don't hold for days so theta doesn't matter, I am buying stocks that definitely have elevated IV, so vega isn't helping me, gamma has little impact because I buy close to the money and sell once in the money, and rho is completely irrelevant right now. With this strategy, should I be choosing options that optimize delta?\n\nAm I wrong for wasting money on the longer dated expiry premium? I absolutely will not buy 0DTE's, but am unsure if weeklies are a better option here. \n\nThanks!",

        "selftext": "To preface this, I'm only advising this for young investors, 18-25.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost of reddit is quick to recommend you throw all of your money into an ETF, but I disagree. In my opinion, ETFs are more for preserving wealth. Individual stocks is where you gain that wealth. When you're at a young age, your risk tolerance should be way higher than when you're in your 40s. I'm not saying gamble your money on a high-risk penny stock, but you should be putting most of your portfolio in individual stocks. Find a few sectors you like, and find companies within those sectors that have historically performed well and have positive earnings growth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will take 5 sectors and compare popular stocks within those sectors against the 1-year performance of the S&amp;P500 \n\nEnergy: \n\nXOM - 52%\n\nCVX - 28%\n\nCOP - 72%\n\nMRO - 151%\n\nSU - 45%\n\nTotal 1yr performance : 69%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIndustrials:\n\nLPX - 94%\n\nSEB - 17%\n\nOC - 20%\n\nBLDR - 104%\n\nNLSN - 15%\n\nTotal 1yr performance: 51%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinancial:\n\nMA - (-5%)\n\nSOFI - 57%\n\nAXP - 27%\n\nPYPL - (12%)\n\nV - (5%)\n\nTotal 1yr performance: 12%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShipping:\n\nZIM - 376%\n\nSBLK - 157%\n\nGOGL - 125%\n\nTGH - 87%\n\nSTNG - 12%\n\nTotal 1yr performance: 151%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTechnology:\n\nNVDA - 139%\n\nNFLX - 24%\n\nAMD - 63%\n\nNET - 124%\n\nINTC - (3%)\n\nTotal 1yr performance: 70%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Total 1yr performance of all these stocks combined: 71%**\n\n**Total 1yr performance of the S&amp;P500: 25%**\n\nPicking individual stocks nearly tripled the performance of the S&amp;P500 over the course of a year. While you did take on more risk, this should be considered encouraged at a younger age. As you get older you should gradually move portions of your portfolio over to more blue chips and ETFs. Anyways, I constantly see people saying only to put stocks into ETFs, but I'm curious to hear your thoughts.",

        "selftext": "Hey there guys, I just started analyzing stocks more and I thought I\u00b4ll try to do that and post it here. That\u00b4s my first analysis for PYPL. If you have any feedback for me that would be great and highly appreciated. If you have questions feel free to ask, I\u00b4ll try to answer everything.\n\nToday we will look through the basics of PayPal\u00b4s business and then see if we can come up with a fair value for PYPL\u00b4s stock using discounted free cashflow.\n\nThis is not financial advice and I personally own shares in PYPL. Nevertheless I will try to stay as unbiased and objective as I can. Always do your own due diligence.\n\nFirst let\u00b4s review their different revenue streams. Their biggest stream, around **90%** of their sales comes from **Transaction Revenues**. The remaining **10%** come from **Revenues from other value added services.**\n\nFor the valuation:\n\nWe take **analyst estimates**, we discount that by our **required return of 7,9%**. Then we use the **perpetual growth rate of 2,5%** and that gave us a fair value for PYPL\u00b4s stock of **$216 per share**. But because we have to account for **PYPL\u00b4s equity** as well, our **fair value of equity** would be **$220 per share**.\n\nNow feel free to include a margin of safety to that.\n\nWith PYPL\u00b4s price being at **$185** **per share** right now, it\u00b4s kind of undervalued. That\u00b4s why I think buying *heavily* might be a good idea. Although you can always dollar-cost-average. That\u00b4s where you invest every month the same amount.\n\n**Where I see PYPL\u00b4s stock price in 5 years.** We can calculate where the price might be in 5 years with the **Earnings Per Share (EPS TTM)**, the **Estimated Growth Rate** and the **Future P/E Value**. With this method I get a stock price of **$529 per share** which is definitely higher than what it is now. \n\n**What I\u00b4ll do.** I believe PYPL is here to stay. I think they will stay for a long time and innovate even more. That\u00b4s why I will start buying heavily every chance I get.\n\nThank you for reading and I hope I\u00b4ll see you again.",

Wood\u2019s main exchange-traded fund, which trades under ticker ARKK, is down more than 12% this week, on pace of its worst week since February. Ark Innovation is down 6% on Friday. The painful losses have left all but 2 of Wood\u2019s constituents more than 20% off their recent high, meaning they are in a bear market. Just Trimble and Tesla are less than 20% from their high, but the pair are both more than 10% from their 52-week records.

SIMO's customers include NAND flash makers, module makers, hyperscalers and OEMs. \n\nSIMO supplies customized high-performance hyperscale data center and industrial SSD solutions. SIMO's customers include most of the NAND flash vendors, storage device module makers and leading OEMs.\n\n**SIMO has a current share price of \\~$72 with a P/E ratio of \\~18x**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-----\n\n**Management Guidance**\n\nOn SIMO's [Q2 2021 earnings call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/07/30/silicon-motion-technology-corporation-simo-q2-2021/), management guided towards significant revenue growth in 2022:\n\n&gt;Based on our latest sales projection, our annual run rate is expected to be already at least $1 billion by this year's fourth quarter. **We expect sales of ultimately exceed $1 billion next year** as we add meaningful incremental foundry capacity already committed to us and from continued execution of our four prong initiative, which includes upselling a richer mix of products. Sales next year will include the rapid scaling of a higher value, high-volume PCIe Gen4 SSD controller.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Our customers have also provided us with purchase orders for the next year, and the order book today already exceeds $1.5 billion.** Our strong order book is a result of many years of hard work. No last minute opportunistic procurement audit of all the shelf parts by customers. We have been building our business pipeline for many years, leading to these purchase orders. Our OEM projects typically kick off one to three years before initial sales, depending on product capacity.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Already, our order book for next year is at least $1.5 billion, and our team is currently working to ensure we can deliver this. Next quarter, we will provide an update on our work. And at the start of next year, we will provide our official 2022 revenue guidance**.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I will say, our client revenue will continue to grow. Although PCIe Gen3 next year growth rate will be modestly, but PCIe Gen will grow very strong to carry because we have a very large design share in PC OEM. We stated almost 50% higher by end of the next year so that we have eight different customer, five on NAND maker with our PCIe Gen4 controller and ramping next year. For eMMC+UFS, we also will grow very, very strongly. It also depends how many wafer we can secure.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We say it's going not to grow for a certain level, **we guarantee is exceed the $1 billion of revenue next year**. But we think the backlog will continue to pile up by end of this year. But we'll continue to work very hard to secure more wafer, especially in mature technology because many eMMC are in 55, 40-nanometer and 28 meter, these mature technology wafer are in severe allocation from all foundry makers. So this is very critical, how fast we can porting, work with TSMC as well as other foundry that can grow overall the eMMC+UFS business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis guidance was confirmed on SIMO's [Q3 2021 earnings call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/28/silicon-motion-technology-corporation-simo-q3-2021/):\n\n&gt; In the third quarter, sales and earnings reached another quarterly company record. **Revenue grew 15% sequentially and over 100% year-over-year to $254 million**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We expect this situation of demanding excess of supply to continue through next year since foundry capacity will likely only start improving in 2023. Our order book remains strong and continues to be well in excess of $1.5 billion for next year.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;**In the third quarter, we delivered $1 billion in revenue run rate a quarter ahead of when we had previously communicated and expect our revenue run rate to increase further in the fourth quarter** as we focus on managing our product mix, customer allocation and pricing. We have already received foundry wafer allocation for 2022. **That is incremental to what we have this year, and we are confident we can grow ourselves next year toward our $1.5 billion order book.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I think based on the third quarter revenue and fourth quarter guidance, we are ready at a $1 billion sale revenue rate with our current wafer supply. We have already received foundry wafer allocation for 2022 as we state. **That's incremental to what we have this year, and we are confident we can grow our sales next year to around $1.5 billion.** We believe the demand will continue to exceed supply next year, but I think we definitely will continue to negotiate and discover TSMC to gain more wafer supply. Regarding the $1.5 billion backlog, I think we -- **our backlog remained very solid with the purchase order of 2022, continued to be well in excess of $1.5 billion**. Most of the backlog consists SSD and eMMC+UFS controller order \\[Indecipherable\\] 23:35. An OEM order is strong because our customers have been gaining share, and we have been gaining share of \\[Indecipherable\\] 23:41 as these customers. We believe we have secured about 50% of all PC OEM and PCIe Gen four socket for next year. But we have seen, however, some adjustment in our order book with the softening of order for channel market product and strengthening our product for OEM customer. For example, we are seeing demand for SSD by global PC OEM continue to strengthen, our current client SSD for retail market, especially in China, softening. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI repeat: management guarantees that revenue will exceed $1B in 2022.\n\nNow what do the anal(ysts) think?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-----\n\n**Analyst Estimates**\n\n* Morgan Stanley research: price target of $78 with only $1B of revenue modelled in 2022 / 2023\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zq7z1bccey281.png?width=473&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8fe6bf8cde6597ea7db096112c377fa7771dd3c3\n\n* Bank of America research: price target of $80 with only \\~$850M of revenue modelled in 2022 / 2023\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ia6skvysey281.png?width=502&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f326906c0291c5bf0a9323ae7a3f7a1ecb52418b\n\nNeedham is the only analyst properly reflecting $1.5B of revenue in 2022.
