Nice, thick operation margin. Current assets are plump and cover liabilities 2x over.  You'll the notice the operating cash flow ratio is a little low, but looking deeper, a chunk of the current liabilities are in the form of deferred revenue (customer prepayments). Their TIE ratio of 5+ clearly indicates they can handle their debt payments. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe other thing I'm happy to see is the plentiful number of open positions on their careers page - a strong indicator of growth.

The Dow already has a four-day losing streak in place, its longest since August, and is coming off its largest weekly loss in five months.

Gantz is Netanyahu\u2019s rival in March 2 elections.

The articles of impeachment charge Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. (AP)\n* Democrats stepped up their calls for former national security advisor John Bolton to testify at the trial after an explosive report alleged that in his unpublished book, he said Trump personally tied Ukraine aid to an investigation of the Bidens, an account that conflicts with the president\u2019s.

U.S. stock futures are sliding early Monday following Wall Street\u2019s worst day of 2020 on Friday. The Dow already has a four-day losing streak in place, its longest since August, and is coming off its largest weekly loss in five months. The S&amp;P 500\u2032s weekly decline last week was its largest in nearly four months. (CNBC)\n* Treasury yields move lower as coronavirus fears escalate (CNBC)\n* Gold climbs to 2-week high as virus fears spark safety buying (Reuters)\n* International oil prices drop below $60 as China virus drives demand concern (Reuters)\n* More than 2,800 people in China are now infected by the fast-spreading Wuhan coronavirus while more countries have reported their first confirmed cases. Chinese officials have said there are 2,862 confirmed cases, with the death toll rising to 81. On Sunday, the United States on Sunday reported its fifth confirmed case in Arizona. (CNBC)\n* Travel-related stocks are likely to be hit once again as coronavirus cases mount, including major airlines like United (UAL), Delta (DAL), American (AAL) and Southwest (LUV), and cruise line operators like Royal Caribbean (RCL), Norwegian (NCLH), and Carnival (CCL). Starbucks (SBUX) and McDonald\u2019s have temporarily closed near the Chinese city of Wuhan.\n* On today\u2019s U.S. economic calendar, the government will release its December report on new home sales at 10 a.m. ET. Arconic (ARNC), DR Horton (DH) and Sprint (S) are among the companies issuing quarterly earnings this morning, while Whirlpool (WHR), Juniper Networks (JNPR) and Rambus (RMBS) report after the bell.\n* Federal safety investigators launched a probe into a helicopter crash in the LA area that killed basketball legend Kobe Bryant and eight others, including his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna. The cause of the crash has not yet been determined. NBA athletes, officials and fans mourned Bryant\u2019s death in messages and memorials across social media.

According to local media, the plane went down in territory under Taliban control. It was initially reported to be a jet from state-owned Ariana Afghan Airlines. However, the airline\u2019s acting CEO has denied that one of their planes has crashed. (CNBC)\n* President Donald Trump is expected to disclose details of his long-delayed Mideast peace proposal to Israeli leaders today. Trump will hold separate, back-to-back meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Benny Gantz, head of the centrist Blue and White Party. Gantz is Netanyahu\u2019s rival in March 2 elections. (Reuters)\n* Trump\u2019s impeachment trial enters a pivotal week as his defense team resumes its case and senators face a critical vote on whether to hear witnesses or proceed directly to a vote that is widely expected to end in his acquittal. The articles of impeachment charge Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. (AP)\n* Democrats stepped up their calls for former national security advisor John Bolton to testify at the trial after an explosive report alleged that in his unpublished book, he said Trump personally tied Ukraine aid to an investigation of the Bidens, an account that conflicts with the president\u2019s. (NBC News)\n* Trump denies telling Bolton Ukraine aid was tied to investigations (The Hill)\n* Sen. Bernie Sanders holds an edge in the 2020 New Hampshire Democratic primary as the key presidential nominating contest nears, according to an NBC News/Marist poll.

        "selftext": "Juniper Networks hit my radar last week and I opened a small position. [Looking](https://stockarmor.com/jnpr.pdf) at the numbers, this is a solid find. Nice, thick operation margin. Current assets are plump and cover liabilities 2x over.  You'll the notice the operating cash flow ratio is a little low, but looking deeper, a chunk of the current liabilities are in the form of deferred revenue (customer prepayments). Their TIE ratio of 5+ clearly indicates they can handle their debt payments. \n\nThe other thing I'm happy to see is the plentiful number of open positions on their careers page - a strong indicator of growth. The rollout of 5G may even provide additional tailwinds.\n\nIf you wanted an alternative to a large mega tech like Cisco in your portfolio. This is it.",
