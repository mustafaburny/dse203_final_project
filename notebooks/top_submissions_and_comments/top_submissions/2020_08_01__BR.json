        "selftext": "Hey all, \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my fiance has had her Roth IRA managed by a family friend, who is a financial advisor. When looking through her Roth I noticed it's all invested into American Funds with relatively high expense ratios. \n\nI told her she should get in contact and let him know that she should roll over her Roth to a Fidelity account and invest into a more diversified and lower expense ratio mix of funds. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is the current makeup of her Roth account:\n\n &lt;!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--&gt;TickerNameExpense RatioAEPGXAMERICAN EUROPACIFIC GROWTH CLASS A0.84AGTHXAMERICAN GROWTH FUND OF AMERICA CLASS0.65AWSHXAMERICAN WASHNTN MUTUAL INVESTRS CL A0.59NEWFXAMERICAN NEW WORLD FUND CLASS A1.03SMCWXAMERICAN SMALLCAP WORLD FUND CLASS A1.08 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is what I'm proposing her Roth account be composed of:\n\n &lt;!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--&gt;%Composition Idea:40%S&amp;P500 and growth index**VOO** |  **VUG**10%Tech Funds**QQQ** | **VGT**15%International**EEM | MCHI**15%Small Cap**VB**10%Speculation**ARKK**5%Bonds**TLT** | **VYM**5%Gold**IAU**  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you guys think?
