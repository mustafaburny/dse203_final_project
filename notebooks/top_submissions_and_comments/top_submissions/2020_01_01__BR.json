        "selftext": "On the [Pivot](https://podcasts.apple.com/br/podcast/pivot-with-kara-swisher-and-scott-galloway/id1073226719?l=en) podcast last week, Kara Swisher said that a several people are running the numbers on Twitter. The thesis is pretty simple. Twitter has a massive audience but hasn't turned it into $$$, so someone else could buy it, and make a better go of it.\n\n[Comscore](https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Rankings?country=US) data shows Twitter getting approximately half the audience of Google or Facebook. [Alexa](https://www.alexa.com/topsites) shows the same. So: comparing the stats:\n\n||Market Cap|US users (Comscore)|Revenue: last 12 months|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Twitter|$25bn|156m|$3.4bn|\n|Google|$986bn|257m|$155bn|\n|Facebook|$622bn|219m|$67bn|\n|Snap|$24bn|111m|$1.5bn|\n\nIf it does get acquired, no doubt the buyer will be obvious with hindsight. So to jump the gun, let's consider who's big enough to pay a 30% premium and not trash their own valuation or debt levels. \n\nHere's my short list, and I've included Snap, to show it is unlikely but still possible:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n||Market Cap|Profit|PE ratio|Cash/Debt|EV/Net Debt|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Apple|$1,360bn|$56bn|24x|$8bn cash|n/a|\n|Microsoft|$1,231bn|$41bn|31x|$59bn cash|n/a|\n|Amazon|$936bn|$10bn|92x|$4bn cash|n/a|\n|AT&amp;T|$279bn|$25bn|11x|$159bn debt|2.6x|\n|Disney|$260bn|$10bn|27x|$42bn debt|2.6x|\n|Verizon|$245bn|$20bn|13x|$107bn debt|2.2x|\n|Comcast|$205bn|$14bn|15x|$103bn debt|3.1x|\n|Netflix|$146bn|$2bn|100x|$8bn debt|0.7x|\n|Charter Comm.|$109bn|$2bn|75x|$74bn debt|4.6x|\n|Softbank|$93bn|$9bn|12x|$125bn debt|4.8x|\n|Sony|$91bn|$5bn|19x|$12bn cash|n/a|\n|Snap :)|$24bn|\\-ve|n/a|$1bn cash|n/a|\n\nA $30% premium would value Twitter at $32bn. Assuming an all cash deal, financed by debt at 5% this would cost $1.5bn a year. Compared to Twitter's net income of $1bn, it would almost be cash-break even.\n\nIn the case of cash positive companies like **Apple** and **Microsoft** it might even be accretive, as their cash piles are unlikely to be generating much income. For others with cash, **Amazon** and **Sony**, it's hard to see it having much of an impact to the PE ratio.\n\nFor the debt heavy firms, it would probably be too much for **Charter** and **Softbank** who are already nearing 5x leverage. **AT&amp;T, Verizon** and **Disney** could do a deal without much damage to their balance sheets or impact to their PE ratio. **Comcast** is somewhere in-between.\n\nWhich leaves the two most interesting options:\n\n* **Netflix** would see its net debt ramps to $40bn and it's leverage ratio get to 3.5x. Uncomfortable but manageable. Given the strategy, and the high price of their stock at 100x, it would probably make sense to part pay in shares.\n* **Snap** just doesn't have the access to $32bn of debt. Even if the purchase was self-financing, using Twitter's cashflow, it's hard to see what lenders would underwrite such a deal. So, again, part equity would be a key way to get this deal across the line. But that's unlikely to be enough. I'd guess a PE firm would need to pony up a $5-10bn part of the equity. And yes, bankers are imaginative folks, and PE folks are awash with cash.\n\nLove to hear everyone's views. \n\nThanks in advance.",

        "selftext": "Hey, it's us again! As we once mentioned, we planned on taking a look at Antibe Therapeutics' lead drug ATB-346 and how sound the science behind it is. In addition we also analyzed available financial filings of past few years to see how well is the company doing from a financial perspective. \n\nVersion with visual materials (pictures, graphs etc): [part 1 (science)](https://premium-pill.com/antibe-therapeutics-analysis-phase-2/) and [part 2 (financials)](https://premium-pill.com/antibe-therapeutics-onto-something-big-part-2/).\n\nHope we could be of service. :) \n\n \n\n**TLDR:** \n\n* **Antibe Therapeutics lead drug, ATB-346, seeks to be a more effective alternative for pain-relieving drugs;** \n* **The  science behind the current FDA trials is pretty sound. We expect Antibe  Therapeutics to successfully complete Phase 2B trials;**\n* **The company is a typical R&amp;D pharmaceutical firm. They are very hungry for capital and churn through money very fast;** \n* **Nonetheless,  the financial situation in the last few years has been mostly stable.  They have proven their ability to find continuous additional capital for drug development**;\n\nTiny Canadian pharmaceutical company, Antibe Therapeutics, is  currently pushing through FDA trials to introduce a potentially  revolutionary new drug \u2013 ATB-346. ATB-346 is an anti-inflammatory drug  and pain-relieving drug. It is also shown that unlike other similar  drugs (ibuprofen, naproxen), it does much less damage to stomach walls. \n\nIn this article, we are going to provide an overview and our own  opinion on the chances of success for ATB-346 to succeed and whether one  should consider investing in Antibe Therapeutics to capture the  possible rise in stock price. For that, we will analyse and explain the  science behind ATB-346 and also look at the company\u2019s financials.\n\n# THE SCIENCE\n\n# What is ATB-346?\n\nATB-346 is a naproxen-based molecule, that releases hydrogen sulphide  (H2S). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs (class of drugs  like ATB-346, ibuprofen, naproxen etc.) play a key role in relieving the  symptoms of osteoarthritis. As osteoarthritis is still a chronic  disease, people need to take the drug frequently \u2013 even for many years.  This shows a great potential market for ATB-346. So far ibuprofen,  naproxen and other NSAIDs are \u201cdestroying stomach walls\u201d on frequent  use. [Take a look at a picture](https://premium-pill.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image.png).\n\nATB-346 intends to protect stomach thanks to hydrogen sulphide (H2S).  Hydrogen sulphide and its gastroprotective effects are one of Antibes  lead scientists most researched subject. We could say that ATB-346 is a  spin-off or practical outlet for his previous research. Its H2S  gastroprotective (attached to naproxen) success is shown previously in  14-day phase 2 trial including 100+ patients. [The success was  outstanding with 94% of ulcer (\u201chole in the stomach wall\u201d) incidence  reduction compared to naproxen itself](https://premium-pill.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-1.png). It also showed lesser overall  gastrointestinal side effects, which is just a bonus.\n\n# Osteoa\u2026 what?\n\nOsteoarthritis is a type of arthritis that occurs when flexible  tissue at the ends of bones wears down (thank you google).  Osteoarthritis affects roughly 20-30 million people in the US \u2013 this is  the potential maximum market in the US (according to various studies,  there are other countries in the world as well\u2026). We\u2019d like to bring out  two key factors affecting the progression of the disease: \n\n* **Obesity**. Heavy bodies increase the pressure on joints and worsen the osteoarthritis. As obesity [steadily rises](https://www.who.int/gho/ncd/risk_factors/overweight_obesity/obesity_adults/en/) in the world, more osteoarthritis is likely to occur. \n* **Age**. As people age, there are biochemical changes in joints which may potentiate osteoarthritis. Even more importantly increasing age increases the risk of traumas, repetitive use of joints, infections, muscle weakness, etc., which all could increase the risk of osteoarthritis or worsen the disease. Between 2015 and 2050, the proportion of the world\u2019s population over 60 years will nearly [double from 12% to 22%](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ageing-and-health). \n\nPeople are getting fatter and older and it probably will increase the need for good pain killers to relieve osteoarthritis pain in the future. \n\n# About the phase 2B trial\n\n**Quick info**[**\\[1\\]**](https://premium-pill.com/antibe-therapeutics-analysis-phase-2/#_ftn1)**:** \n\n* Began: 18.03.2019\n* End of data collection: 29.12.2019 (estimated/pushed forward to Q1 2020)\n* Disease: Osteoarthritis\n* Testing: ATB-346 (150, 200, and 250 mg) for pain relief against a placebo\n* Number of subjects: 360\n* Age of subjects: 40-75 (both sexes)\n\nThe Phase 2B trial was estimated to end on December 29, 2019. It  began on March 18, 2019. The investigative period is 14 days with 10-day  follow-up for side effects, which is quite short, yet appropriate for  phase 2. But don\u2019t expect the news now, because it seems, they are still  recruiting patients and after that, it takes time to finish the  analysis. They have officially said to release the results in Q1 2020.  As of the end of November, they had tested about 70% of required 360  test subjects.\n\n# How likely is phase 2B trial going to be successful?\n\nAccording to a previous study mentioned [here](https://premium-pill.com/clinical-trial-success-rates-for-investor/), this type of drugs (anti-inflammatory) success rates for phase 2 have been **45.7%**.  However, Antibe is conducting a trial for the lead indication  (osteoarthritis). The previous success rate for lead indication in this  group of drugs has been **48.7%**.\n\nThere is good evidence that this drug is effective for protecting the  stomach walls. Now they intend to further prove the pain-relieving  effect of the drug. **Antibe has previously successfully proved the effect of ATB-346 against naproxen on 12 patients**. This time they are recruiting a total of **360 patients**  and comparing it to placebo. Note that it is easier to prove efficacy  against a placebo than a comparator drug. Against placebo, the drug must  have at least some effect. Against comparator drug, it must be at least  as effective as the already working drug. And on 12 patients in the  previous trial, it was already as effective as naproxen. So, this the  first reason why this trial should succeed.\u00a0 \n\n[In the red is marked the molecule of naproxen](https://premium-pill.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-3.png). If it gets released from the other part of the molecule, it should act as naproxen we already know and use today. Meaning, that we already know the potential benefits and side effects of one part of this drug. **More importantly, we know that the part under investigation (naproxen part), is already effective in relieving pain**, which the trial intends to prove. Also, releasing the naproxen part from the whole molecule might not even be necessary, as the naproxen part could effectively bind to receptors even with its added \u201ctail\u201d and still produce an effect. This is the second reason why this trial should succeed. \n\nThe investigative period is 14 days + 10 days follow up for possible  side effects. Meaning it is enough to evaluate short term (2 weeks) pain  relief, but too short to expose long term side effects. Not exposing  side-effects is good for this specific trial to succeed. In the long  term however, they must prove the long-term safety as well as increase  number of patients for the trial. \n\n# We find that this trial has a high chance of succeeding because:\n\n* **It is easier to succeed versus a placebo:**   \nIt compares the pain-relieving effect to placebo, yet on 12 patients it  has shown to be as effective as a working pain-killer naproxen. In a [trial with 100+ patients](https://antibethera.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Wallace-2019-Br-J-Pharmacol-ATB-346-Phase-2B-GI-Safety.pdf),  it inhibited thromboxane synthesis (responsible for pain via activation  of COX enzymes) the same amount as naproxen. It should do well against a  placebo.\n* **Part of the drug is being used already:**   \n\u201cNaproxen\u201d part of the ATB-346 molecule is itself already well known  and effective in mild to moderate pain-relieving. Again, a reason why it  should do well against the placebo group.\n* **Trial period is in favour of success:**   \nShort trial period serves in the favour of proving pain-relieving efficacy without showing any long-term side effects, that might halt or kill the trial.\n\n# What could go wrong in this trial? \n\n* Feeling of pain is subjective. Trials in larger groups of  patients could reveal that earlier studies could have been a fluke,  because of the subjective pain measurement.   \n**Not to worry too much**: As explained above, it  currently shows to be as effective as already marketed drug naproxen.  Also, they are using a standardised pain measurement test WOMAC, which  should give as objective responses as possible and is used in most  trials investigating osteoarthritis pain. \n* 250 mg dose of ATB\u2010346 contains approximately one-sixth the  amount of naproxen as the 550 mg, twice\u2010daily dose of naproxen. Usually  naproxen blood plasma levels are 40-70 mcg/ml, ATB-346 levels are at  14-17 mcg/ml. Rising the question of can it really produce a  pain-relieving effect?   \n**Not to worry too much**: Antibe has shown in its trials that both ATB-346 and naproxen affect the main known pain biochemical pathway (COX inhibition via measuring thromboxane activity) equally. Meaning there is strong reason to believe that it relieves pain as well as naproxen.\n* H2S has a wide range of other physiological functions (as with  all simpler molecules), which may in time, reveal many unwanted side  effects. Worse if these side effects happen during this trial and they  are severe enough to stop it.   \n**Not to worry too much**: if there would have been  anything especially serious, the trial would have stopped already. Yet  they are still going and nearing the end. Even more, it actually showed  less potency for at least the usual naproxen side effects. Its trial  period (24 days for side effects) is really narrow to reveal long term  side effects. \n* They are having problems with recruiting the patients. [70% recruited as of 28.11.2019](https://antibethera.com/news/antibe-therapeutics-provides-corporate-update-and-reports-q2-2020-interim-financial-and-operating-results/).\u00a0  Recruitment went past the previous deadline, yet they have the largest  number of trial centres open in Canada.\u00a0 This is mainly due to their  patient inclusion and exclusion criteria. They are looking for healthy  elderly patients with only osteoarthritis. How many of these kinds of  patients are there?   \n**Not to worry too much**: It is common for phase 2  efficacy trials to not include patients with more diseases. It is easier  to analyse and prove efficacy with less intervening factors. Such as  dealing with side effects and the extra costs related to it. And that\u2019s  what we want from this trial!  \n* They run out of money. This is unlikely to happen as they have  enough money for the completion of Phase 2B trials and also they have  the capital to begin preparatory work on Phase 3.\u00a0\n\n# Conclusion on the science\n\nFrom purely the trial perspective, considering even the negative parts, we\u2019d say the success rate is definitely more than **48,7%**. In fact, we would be really surprised if the Phase 2B trial actually fails because:\n\n1. They are proving that **naproxen** part of ATB-346, that is already a marketed painkiller, relieves pain more than taking nothing (\u201cplacebo aka sugar-pill\u201d), **meaning it should be effective**;\n2. They  already have data (100+ patients), that it does inhibit enzymes  responsible for the induction of pain (shown by the reduction of  thromboxane activity), **meaning it should be effective**;\n3. Trial period is too short to reveal any long-term serious side effects to halt this particular phase 2 trial, **meaning it should be safe**;\n4. Many  trials fail because they are not able to recruit enough patients or run  out of money. They have already recruited 70% of the 360 patients and  opened new centres, **meaning they should get enough patients**. So the only question remains \u2013 how capable is the company financially?  \n\n \n\n# THE NUMBERS\n\n# Introduction \n\nSince Antibe Therapeutics is primarily an R&amp;D pharmaceutical  firm, its\u2019 financial metrics cannot be evaluated by normal standards.  Moreover, it would very difficult to provide a valuation of the company  since it would require one to make an assumption on the success of their  drug developments, marketability, prices, profit margins of said drugs.  All in all, let\u2019s be honest \u2013 the provided valuation would probably be  as accurate as the one you could read out from tea leaves or sheep  intestines using dark and mysterious rituals. \n\nOne more thing: all the numbers below are expressed in Canadian dollars and 1 CAD\u00a0 = 0,77 USD. \n\nSince we cannot possibly in good faith provide a valuation, we can  merely delve into the company\u2019s corporate and financial documents and  seek for positive/negative signs. Those signs are for example amount of  cash and liabilities company, how leveraged (in debt) the company is,  are there any numbers that do not really add up and hint that something  might be shady and so on.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nAntibe Therapeutics is divided into two segments: **Antibe Therapeutics**, company for pharmaceutical development and its\u2019 subsidiary **Citagenix**, a marketer and distributor of regenerative medicines serving the dental and orthopaedic marketplaces. \n\nNote: sometimes the company\u2019s fiscal year is different than the  calendar year. In Antibe for example, the fiscal year starts with the  first of April (jokes on you) and finishes on the 31st of March.\n\nR&amp;D part of the business, Antibe, generates no revenue whatsoever  and solely focuses on drug development. Citagenix, on the other hand,  most likely generates over 10 million CAD of revenue in the fiscal year  2020. As of September 30, 2019, Citagenix had generated 5,030 million  CAD revenue, as opposed to 4,611 million CAD (**ca +9%**) at the same time in the year 2018. This shows a continuous growth trend. \n\nBut as revenue grows, cost of sales and expenses also increase, which  has resulted in operating at a loss also for Citagenix. The management  has explained incurring losses\u00a0 in the following way: *\u201cdue to the  seasonal slowdown of the business during the summer months, competitive  pressures in Canada, the repositioning of the instrument business and  the ongoing expansion into the US and the consequent expense on  marketing and operational initiatives.\u201d* \n\nThe company management expects growth strategy in the U.S. to result  in improved profitability and growth in fiscal 2020. If the company is  going for growth in other markets, operating at a loss is nothing  special and should not scare anybody off. Moreover, it is not common  that small pharmaceutical firms have already operating segments driving  stable revenue. Thanks to Citagenix, Antibe Therapeutics has some more  room to maneuver thanks to additional generated cash flow as opposed to  companies focusing solely on the R&amp;D. \n\n# How is their expansion going?\n\nRevenue by geographic region for the six months ended September 30, 2019, is as follows:\n\n* Canada 54% **(-6%)**\n* United States\u00a0 31% **(+6%)** \n* Europe\u00a0 4% **(+2%)** \n* Rest of World\u00a0 11% **(-2%)** \n\nThey have increased their presence 6% in the last six months, leading  us to conclude that at least short term their plan seems to be working  and thus decreasing the single market risk.\n\n**Some small observations**\n\n* Citagenix (and well, Antibes as well since Citagenix is the only  revenue stream for the company) gross profit is moving up (3,549  million      CAD vs 3,375 million CAD annually **\u2013 ca +5%**)  in 2019. There is a reason to expect that gross profit for fiscal 2020  will be more than the year before as the half-year results show  improvements (1,975 million CAD in 2020 for the first half of the fiscal  year versus 1,812 million CAD for the first half of the fiscal 2019 \u2013 **ca +8%**). [The gross profit margin seems to be hovering around 40% mark](https://premium-pill.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-7.png). The gross  profit margin shows how much money did the company make from sales  after deducting the cost of goods sold (for every 1 CAD, they earned ca  40 cents). With their expansion, it seems that the margin has largely  remained the same, which is a good thing and means that the company is  retaining its\u2019 previous pricing power. However, this does not take into  account the cost of selling and general costs etc, which currently  outweigh the gross profit (due to expansion into other markets) and make  the company actually lose money instead of profiting. \n* [Revenue is moving up (9,5 million CAD vs 8,5 million CAD \u2013 ca +11%)](https://premium-pill.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-8.png)**.**\n* Expenses  are also going up (more than 50% if you compare the fiscal      2018 to  fiscal 2019!). This trend is continuous also in the fiscal 2020 as       the Phase 2 trials for ATB-346 are on-going and expensive. \n* Losses  are mounting (net loss increased from 4,990 million CAD in      first  six months of 2018 to 8,245 million CAD in 2019 \u2013 ca **+65%**).  Losses are expected to further increase as Phase 3 trial for ATB-346  (if it passes Phase 2) will be even more expensive than Phase 2  (approximately 30 million CAD).  \n\n# Shareholder equity\n\nAntibe Therapeutics shareholder equity has a whopping deficit of -48  million CAD. This means that the company\u2019s liabilities exceed its\u2019  assets almost by 50 million CAD and should ATE.V go under, you will get  nothing but a lesson for the future on risk management. :)  \n\nIn this case, the negative equity is largely due to accumulated  historical losses. Once again, this can be expected from a small R&amp;D  pharmaceutical company but it shows how risky the financial situation  of the company is. \n\n[This squiggly line above shows very well how the company has to constantly recapitalize itself.](https://premium-pill.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-9.png) However, this is not a bad thing at all  since it would seem that currently the ATB-346 trials (and largely the  company overall) are funded through capital markets (by issuing  additional stock and warrants) and thus does not put the company in  danger of drowning in debt. This is great from the perspective of the  financial health of the company as the company does not need to pay back  the received funding. It puts company (as they state themselves) in a  dangerous position as it will need regular re-capitalization from the  market, which is not beneficial to exist shareholders because of the  dilution. It also means that in case of a recession, market crash or  change in investors\u2019 sentiment, the funding for trials can dry up really  quickly.\n\n# Liabilities\n\nConsolidated liabilities have risen from 7,378 million to 8,344 million ( ca **+13%**).  Most of the increase is actually from Citagenix part of the business  and liabilities and current (short term obligations, usually due to  within a year). Overall, the company has increased current liabilities  from 2,907 million CAD to 5,851 million CAD (more than **+100%**)  from March 31, 2019, to September 30, 2019. Out of 5,851 million, 3,537  million CAD is from payable accounts and accrued liabilities. Loans  take lesser, 2,143 million CAD of the total current liabilities. \n\nAccounts payable are in essence debts for already rendered services.  If you buy a phone but pay for it in the following 6 months, the cost of  the phone together with interest is the payable account. That does not  mean that the company has taken on a lot of debt but rather means that  the company has pushed the payment date of services/products to the  future. This is beneficial and recommendable action from a business  perspective because it allows you to maintain cash liquidity and thus  options to use capital in other more productive ways in the meantime.  Still, about a third of the current liabilities (and pretty much total  liabilities) is debt, which puts the company is a constant need to  service the loan. \n\n# How solvent is the company? \n\nOne possible way to evaluate the company\u2019s solvency is the \u201cacid  test\u201d. In essence, you find the ratio between cash and current  liabilities. The recommended ratio for a \u201ctypical\u201d company is 1.1  (meaning that they have a bit more cash at hand than liabilities that  must be paid within a year). \n\n[Acid test shows us that for the majority of last year the company was  above 1](https://premium-pill.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-11.png). This means that there was no substantial risk of insolvency  due to current liabilities and this is perceived as a good thing. The  company has so far enough liquidity and a positive influx of capital to  continue with drug development and trials. \n\n# Cash\n\nDue to recent share and warrant (warrant gives a right to buy half a share in this case) issuance, company raised in total 7,637 million CAD and the total end of the period cash in 30th of September is 8,292 million CAD as opposed to 3.162 million CAD the previous year. The share and warrant issuance provided enough runway to see ATB-346 trials to the end of Phase 2 and hopefully fund some of Phase 3. In the documentation to issue new shares and warrants, the company stated that in August that the remaining cost for the Phase 2B study is 3,83 million CAD, which is to be funded by cash on hand and proceeds of the offering. **This means that they definitely have capital to complete Phase 2B.** \n\nThey projected that funds raised in August will last them until summer of 2020. This means that the funds are also meant to cover some of the costs related to Phase 3 trials and other pipeline projects. \n\nThe company expects Phase 3 trials to costs approximately 30 million CAD and they expect to commence with the trials in mid-2020 (lasting about 2 years).\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIssues Antibe Therapeutics is facing are common for every small pharmaceutical or biotech company. In fact, they actually are in a more beneficial position comparatively since they also have a back-up source of revenue in name of Citagenix and they do not solely lie on the success of their lead drug, ATB-346. It must be stressed though, that company\u2019s stock price is most likely correlated only to the performance of their on-going drug trials for ATB-346. This means that if the trials do not go as well as expected, the stock price will likely fall faster than a drunk guy trying to wear heels. \n\nAs we stated above, we are not comfortable giving our own guess on how the stock price reacts. Please refer to our previous [article](https://premium-pill.com/investing-in-pharmaceutical-companies/) on the average performance of pharmaceutical stocks with on-going drug trials. We do think that the trial is likely to be a success and will boost the stock price. \n\nThough wealth management and capital markets advisory firm [Echelon has given stock price a target of 1.40 CAD](https://www.cantechletter.com/2019/12/antibe-therapeutics-is-a-junior-biotech-stock-with-promise-echelon/). Anyhow, should the trials go well, Antibe Therapeutics definitely has a big potential upside in stock price. \n\nWow, you got to the end? Thanks for reading!",

        "selftext": "Last year, Blackstone\u2019s Byron Wien absolutely nailed a few of the stock-market calls he made on his list of \u201cTen Surprises\u201d that he\u2019s been publishing, typically with input from fellow billionaire George Soros, since 1986.\n\nFor one, he predicted the Shanghai Composite [**SHCOMP,** **-0.01%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/shcomp?countrycode=cn&amp;mod=MW_story_quote) would rally 25%. It gained 22%. He said Brazil\u2019s equity market would come alive. The Bovespa [**BVSP,** **-0.84%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/bvsp?countrycode=br&amp;mod=MW_story_quote) surged 34%. He said the S&amp;P 500 [**SPX,** **+0.35%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/spx?mod=MW_story_quote) would rally 15%. It easily outperformed that. Not bad.\n\n\u201cThe most positive factor was the accommodative monetary policy provided by the U.S. and other countries, which had a favorable impact on the economy and the financial markets,\u201d the company explained in retrospect.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/legendary-wall-street-investor-warns-of-several-5-market-corrections-in-2020-2020-01-06](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/legendary-wall-street-investor-warns-of-several-5-market-corrections-in-2020-2020-01-06)",
