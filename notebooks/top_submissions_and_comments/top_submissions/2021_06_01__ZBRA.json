        "selftext": "I want opinions on this hedging strategy for a massive market crash.\n\nHere\u2019s the trade:\n\nInstrument:\n\n275 DTE Zebra call spread whilst also selling monthly credit spreads to offset the costs incase the spread expires worthless. Purchase 2 75delta call($20) and sell 1 50delta call.\n\nThe cost of this spread would be $950 acting as 100 shares of VIX. Now you would also sell 6monthly call credit spreads per zebra. This would result in $120 profit per month which means assuming you collect max profit on all spreads you would break even. I chose to sell 6 per zebra as we would get the above result. \n\nAny holes in this plan?",
