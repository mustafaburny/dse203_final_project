        "selftext": "**TL;DR**: Secureworks, $SCWX, a managed cloud and software cybersecurity provider is set to pop hard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **COVID has been hugely bullish for cybersecurity** with growth and earnings beats across the industry. But SCWX is lagging behind other cybersec firms in recovery--**down 20% pre-Rona where similar cybersec firms are up 20-50%.**\n2. **Announced a partnership program** last week to license their software to other companies to provide managed security. Tells me **a)** they\u2019re so **damn busy with new customers** transitioning to WFH networks they need to outsource the work, **b)** SCWX **should be priced for growth** whereas they were previously the \u201cvalue\u201d play within cybersecurity.\n3. Insiders insanely bullish in April. **CEO nearly doubled his shares**\n4. High short interest and low float will make them run hard once they start moving up. **Short squeeze likely.**\n\n**SCWX 17.50c 7/17**, then sell just before or after June 4th earnings report. Other plays in write up. Start off with a limit order at 20 cents and raise from there if no fill.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I originally posted about SCWX a week ago and they've popped up \\~15% since then*. I\u2019m feeling even more bullish on them now after they announced their partnership news. I deleted the [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gkd9ax/missed_net_and_okta_heres_an_easy_2_to_10_bagger/fqqfimg/)\u00a0after some big retards must have thrown a market order at these options and more than doubled the price in 15 minutes. Please use limit orders to buy in cheaply.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Company basics\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Market cap|$1.06 billion|\n|:-|:-|\n|Price at close yesterday [(Marketwatch)](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/scwx)|$13.28|\n|ATH|$23.11, Jan 2019|\n|Core product|Managed cloud network security|\n|Customers|Include 23% of Fortune 500, 25% of total customers are international|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t3631diai9151.png?width=3128&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cab3357ac96e38a5fbf5890787250e8c63e0e1ad\n\nLet's hear what they do straight from their [**latest 10-K filing**](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1468666/000146866620000019/scwx10-kfy2020x01312020.htm):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;We are a leading global provider of technology-driven information security solutions singularly focused on protecting our customers from cyber attacks. We combine deep experience from service to thousands of customers, machine learning and automation from our proprietary technology, and actionable insights from our team of elite researchers, analysts, and consultants to create a powerful network effect that provides increasingly strong protection for our customers. By aggregating and analyzing data from various sources around the world, we prevent security breaches, detect malicious activity in real time, respond rapidly and predict emerging threats.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Our vision is to be the essential cybersecurity company for a digitally connected world. Through our vendor-neutral approach, **we create integrated and comprehensive solutions by proactively managing the collection of \u201cpoint\u201d products deployed by our customers to address specific security issues and provide supplemental solutions where gaps exist in our customers\u2019 defenses**. We seek to provide the right level of security for each customer's unique situation, which evolves as the customer's organization grows and changes.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We have pioneered an integrated approach that delivers a broad portfolio of information security solutions to organizations of varying size and complexity. Our flexible and scalable solutions support the evolving needs of the largest, most sophisticated enterprises staffed with in-house security experts, as well as small and medium-sized businesses and government agencies with limited in-house capabilities and resources.\n\nThe two keys here are **managed** and **portfolio**.\n\nUnlike most of their competition, **SCWX manages the security software they sell**. As part of the subscription price of the software, you pay for a SCWX security professional to monitor your suspicious logs in real time and investigate/communicate when they see a pattern consistent with an attack. Customers can also pay retainers for responses to potential breaches, so that when an attack is detected a team of SCWX professionals on standby will try to quickly shut the attack down and determine the extent of the damage. Along with managed security, they sell training, consultation, and testing for a company's security network. Additionally, SCWX has recently launched a SaaS platform that allows customers to use their software without purchasing management solutions which will help them grow even more among more price-sensitive and tech-savvy segments.\n\n**Managed security should be even more bullish than unmanaged security during this pandemic**. Companies that could manage their own security (i.e. tech and very large) already do and only needed to secure more devices. Whereas companies/government agencies/educational institutions that aren't capable of fielding a team of cybersecurity experts have suddenly found themselves in need of network security for their work from home (WFH) staff and the websites that drive 100% of their present income. These groups now suddenly need to pay someone to set up and manage cybersecurity that they were unprepared to manage themselves. In the past few years analysts have been less bullish on managed security companies for two reasons: higher costs (i.e. staff) and less growth potential (can't just add more servers and run the same code base). I think the pandemic changes some of that however, because SCWX has the badly needed security professionals which are in short supply.\n\nSecurity should never be thought of as a collection of individual tasks/actions, but as a **system**, because any one vulnerability can fuck up everything. Unlike competitors that focus on apps for solving particular problems, SCWX offers a comprehensive security solution. They offer suspicious activity detection and response, network security, endpoint security, malware/spyware detection and response, log management, firewall management, and other security features. Having an ecosystem of products helps them to tailor solutions to protect their clients from any of the variety of threats that they may face. If you've read Black Swan/Antifragile, then you know that antifragility comes from systems thinking and managing your environment holistically.\n\n[SCWX provides holistic cybersecurity](https://preview.redd.it/v480m6fgh9151.png?width=3132&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53e29093850fbecb4926db1dd5f3b42696a7ccc4)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Peers: software and cloud cybersecurity firms are hitting new all time highs\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lqvhjizuh9151.png?width=1414&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a200cb667129443736ddf37bb1af97edfd1886ff\n\n**SCWX should be trading at February prices at a minimum. Cybersecurity is hot right now**. Amid the international distrust of pandemic, there have been many hacking attempts targeting new work-from-home networks, hospitals, biotechs, educational institutions, and government systems.\n\n[At least 28 US hospitals have been hacked this year.](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/cybersecurity/28-health-system-cyberattacks-data-breaches-so-far-in-2020.html)\n\n[Foreign nations have been attacking government and healthcare infrastructure.](https://www.cityam.com/rival-states-launch-cyber-attacks-on-uk-and-us-coronavirus-labs/)\n\n[Foreign countries have been trying to steal data from companies working on cures.](https://www.newsweek.com/report-accuses-iran-attack-drug-company-coronavirus-1502838)\n\nAdditionally, SCWX has partnerships with CRWD and QLYS for endpoint security and vulnerability management respectively and it should be participating more heavily in their upside.\n\nNET, AKAM, and QLYS have all reported earnings in the last month. Their share prices spiked 10% in the week before their respective reports. They beat earnings slightly and then dumped off most of the gains to recover them a week or two later. Given both the trend of cybersecurity earnings beats and SCWX's own steady growth, **I think a massive earnings beat is likely compared to the analysts' low expectations.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qnjjgdxfk9151.png?width=658&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09c1f4917d6a647c37ca4e1c99c8507cbece6648\n\nUnlike it's competitors, **SCWX is priced cheaply** compared to their assets, at 7.5x cheaper than the median of the sample below. Even if you only want to buy shares, SCWX is a fantastic deal for picking up cloud cybersecurity assets compared to it's peer group.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Ticker|Price to book value|\n|:-|:-|\n|**SCWX**|**1.63**|\n|NET|12.04|\n|OKTA|55.07|\n|CRWD|21.96|\n|QLYS|11.86|\n|AKAM|4.41|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Partnership program announcement\n\n[Article.](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/secureworks-launches-new-global-partner-program-to-address-growing-demand-for-cybersecurity-solutions-2020-05-21?mod=mw_quote_news) Last week, SCWX announced a program so that other companies can license their software to build and sell managed security solutions. While their price jumped nearly 10% after the announcement, I don't think the implications have been fully realized.\n\n1. Against the common criticism of managed security as low growth, **SCWX is now poised for massive expansion**. Now other companies can target niche markets (region, sector, pricing, government, etc), while SCWX can focus on their core competencies. Letting specialized security companies handle clients with particular needs will cut some of their work bloat and stay efficient as a company. SCWX should start to approach the valuations of the cloud and SaaS security companies now that they can act like a managed security company without doing the managing.\n2. **THEY'RE GODDAMNED BUSY RIGHT NOW**. If their own security professionals were only half-busy right now, they wouldn't make this sort of announcement because it would undercut their own productivity/profitability. But if SCWX is swamped with new clients and with old clients who need more work done, then they would need to find ways to unload their work profitably. Partnership allows them to quickly add clients to their roster by pairing them with vetted security firms that don't have the same software base as SCWX.\n\n# Massive amounts of insider buying\n\nIn the last month, insiders, mainly the CEO, bought more stock than they did in the rest of last year.  I'm betting that they're doing brisk business and they think the stock is undervalued at current prices.\n\n[Source: NASDAQ](https://preview.redd.it/soizm2dzh9151.png?width=1210&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e73a75d162b9bfdee12067f60b63b147ce5924df)\n\n# Potential short squeeze\n\nNominally, the class A stock has a float (shares available to public, i.e. not insiders or index funds) of 63% and **15% short interest**. That level of short interest is on the low end of the right range where short squeezes are common.\n\nMost of the company's value, however, is locked up in class B stock held exclusively by Dell (12.12MM class A shares, 70MM class B shares). **The real float of the company is closer to 11.7%**. Low float is generally indicative of an extremely volatile share price. If SCWX picks up momentum, it will move up quickly as the short holders get squeezed and few market participants are able to sell.\n\nAdditionally, 25% of all class A shares are held by insiders and 62% are held by institutional investors; which is a bullish breakdown that implies knowledgeable folks are holding.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Technicals\n\nI don't believe in magic crayon bollocks, but I want to draw attention to yesterday's trading which was the fairly wild for SCWX. Below we see a gap up, followed by a momentum algo pile-on or short squeeze to a two month high, a retest of last week's close, and then consolidation at +5%. Due to the volatility of SCWX on up days like yesterday, this trade will be most rewarding to traders who either actively check the charts or set profit-taking limit sells (like I do).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vm7fvqn1i9151.png?width=858&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=898d4a72bdd1e5c04842df343b7ed2f8b4cc0c07\n\nI think there's a legit possibility that this trade could be a ten-bagger, but I have set half my contracts to sell with a stop-limit order when they are up 100% so that I can take make my remaining contracts \"free\" without having to follow the chart all day. If that order executes, I'll probably set my next stop-limit order for a more outrageous amount like +300-500%, or I will follow the timeline below.\n\n# Strategy\n\nQ1 **earnings for SCWX are going to be reported pre-market on June 4th**. I expect a big run-up before then as other cybersecurity firms report high earnings and continue to be bid up. I hope the stock is up high enough that I can **sell June 3rd at a big profit**. If the stock moves up, but dip right before earnings, then I'll hold through earnings and sell just after at either a profit or a loss. I have TP hands (it happens when you watch 4/17 SPY puts go from +300% to -90%) and will take some profit/cut some losses early depending on how the trade goes.\n\nI recommend the **7/17 17.50 call** option for a couple of reasons:\n\n1. **Most liquid** call option in the entire chain with OI &gt; 300. The **bid-ask is still as wide as your wife's pussy, so be careful** with your orders. You can also do the 15c and 20c contracts for more/less risk, but there is less OI. The June contracts are more \"on thesis,\" but OI is less than 30 and I never buy contracts with that low of volume.\n2. I want a lot of **gamma** because I think the share price is going to make big swings in the next few days. The 17.50c offers the right amount of leverage for my taste.\n3. I think there is a solid chance (\\~30%) they will become ATM or higher by earnings.\n4. **Protection from theta gang**. There will still be over a month of time value on these bad boys after earnings, while we're only holding for a week.\n\nAgain, there's some other interesting options in the chain, you can also do spreads to lower cost basis, or you can sell covered calls to profit off the same move and make money off autists YOLOing into these contracts.\n\nBelow is the payout table I calculated for the 17.50c option. *Note that 50 cents might not be the best available price*, if you pay too much you'll take an immediate loss. And if you get in cheaper, growth potential is even higher. I did not take into account the pre-earnings IV pump which should act in your favor.\n\n[Options payout table](https://preview.redd.it/9dkbnog4i9151.png?width=691&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98a65739dee8b4c59dc7c7a57d1dafd597b78ba1)\n\n**Risks for this play:**\n\n1. The market is efficient and SCWX is correctly priced.\n2. Managed security does not attract more customers due to expense or inability to support additional customers.\n3. Existing customers too cash-strapped to buy more security infrastructure.\n4. During last earnings call, March 27th, SCWX gave guidance for lower earnings next quarter due to pandemic. (But that was when everyone was still freaking the fuck out and reported earnings were only to end of February.)\n5. Rug pull on entire market.\n6. Burned on bid-ask spread.\n7. CRWD and OKTA miss earnings (later this week).\n8. Fuckery by Dell related to the class B shares.\n9. Pretty much any risk listed in the SCWX 10-K.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am not your financial advisor.

We have crazy sold out products across the board, this thing can moon to heaven. Looking at the closer timeframes though, picture is supported, but cautious.\n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/x/6RKKwcuI\n\nHuge ascending triangle with a break. Wait for earnings and we can see it go up crazy or down harder. I personally see it more to the upside. Volume spiking into earnings . I see this as bullish , take it as you will. If it dies though, it has many levels to go down.\n\nEdit on LOGI: There can be a selloff tomorrow. If you want to be cheeky with a pre earnings play, buy at 9:30 ish, sell at 12 or after. I bet you make money :D \n\nZM also a great play off LOGI going up\n\n$CAKE \n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/x/7eDMVGNZ\n\nVery interesting levels with VERY high volume to focus on DURING these lows. Volume is heavy, and it is finally breaking upwards. Looks like it will pass this next test and go big. That is my focus for this upcoming move, will be looking to accumulate.\n\nI will update this as we go forward, but with news of reopening and you bet ya 99999% customer growth will moon this shit to the top.\n\nLong at any point.\n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/x/oyD7xfav/ \n\nThere is a broader ascending channel we might bounce off of, but we broke into that descending channel which I expect us to at LEAST hit the midpoint of.\n\n$HD\n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/i/Zk951opc/\n\nEarnings coming up, will likely run up into earnings but I can see a pullback this week. \nAt top of range but can breakthrough, keys to look at. It is at Top of BB band and has usually respected that. Healthy pullback very likely. Thing is though, post pullback, I believe we approach that 239 range and beat it. If we break, which is often what is occurring with HD , we likely go further and test ATH . Will follow up on this when the time comes. Check out the strength in this stock! Wait till pullback or set a buying area, I say between that buy zone I placed to begin accumulation.\n\n\nMight post more just please request any!",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 25th, 2020.\n\n# **Market could get a boost as states reopen, but new economic data will show just how bad things got during shutdowns  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/22/market-could-get-a-boost-as-states-reopen-but-new-economic-data-will-show-just-how-bad-things-got-during-shutdowns.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks are likely to hang on every medical development and the progress of state reopenings, but there will also be some key economic data in the coming week that should provide a glimpse into the depths of the state shutdowns.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s beige book of economic activity is released Wednesday afternoon. There is also April manufacturing data in durable goods Thursday and April\u2019s consumer income and spending data Friday. While that should provide an interesting view of how sluggish activity became, the market is expected to focus more on May consumer confidence Tuesday and consumer sentiment Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe backward looking data is not going to get any attention paid to it,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be terrible, and that\u2019s not going to be a surprise. Confidence has held up pretty well, all things considered. It\u2019s the PPP and unemployment benefits. People who get some support for income seem to be pretty confident.\u201d Congress is expected to take up changes to the Paycheck Protection Program for small business when it returns June 1.\n*****\n&gt; April\u2019s economic data is expected to be about the worst of the recession, since most state shutdowns extended through a good part of the month, ahead of May reopenings. First quarter gross domestic product is expected to have declined by 4.8% when a second reading is released Wednesday, but for the second quarter, GDP is expected to decline by a median 33.1%, according to CNBC/Moody\u2019s Analytics Rapid Update, a survey of economists.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks gained in the past week, though rising tensions between the U.S. and China weighed on the market Thursday and Friday and could become a bigger headwind.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was heading for a weekly gain of 3%, its second weekly gain in three. A big catalyst came Monday, when Moderna disclosed positive data from a small group of patients in an early trial, but it was a wild week of trading for the company\u2019s stock as doubts arose about its limited results. On Friday, however, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said the data showed promise and he was cautiously optimistic a vaccine would be developed.\n*****\n&gt; Astra Zeneca\u2019s vaccine effort got a boost this week when it received $1 billion from the U.S. Health Department\u2019s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to develop a coronavirus vaccine from the University of Oxford.\n*****\n&gt; With investors focused on vaccines and state reopenings, market winners were the more volatile Russell 2000, up 7.8% for the week and the Dow Transports, up nearly 9.1% as airlines and other reopening stocks rallied. Airlines were up nearly 20% on the week. After a batch of earnings reports, retailers were also higher on the week, with the SPDR S&amp;P Retail ETF up 6% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; Retailers are again among the companies reporting earnings in the week ahead, as the first quarter reporting season winds down. Costco, Nordstrom, Ulta Beauty and Burlington Stores are some of the names reporting.\n*****\n&gt; Keon said he is watching the economic reopenings and says the success really depends on the behavior of individuals, and whether there\u2019s another spike in infections.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPeople are still scared,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the personal behavior that\u2019s going to make a difference to economic behavior. We\u2019ll get back to some semblance of normal. It\u2019s going to take awhile for people to feel more confident.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He expects to see a rebound of economic activity in the second half of the year, but not a V-shaped recovery.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBy the end of the year, if we don\u2019t get a vaccine, we will have made a lot of progress on a vaccine. I\u2019m still cautiously optimistic that the market can hang in, and maybe end the year a little bit higher,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; One big reopening in the week ahead will be on Tuesday when the iconic NYSE trading floor reopens.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/AUZd4pd.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TGBcnTP.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DjoySnm.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/yJXH3jZ.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Q0QEkmb.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/c5ZprTz.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jn7Momp.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ym1qBMT.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Mr8CSMQ.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FPry3Mw.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/QGY45ds.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/qjKjCb6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/KiRgaMa.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Weekly Market Performance \u2013 May 22, 2020: Stocks Solid in the Midst of Health and Political Challenges\n\n&gt; # Equities\n\n&gt; US equities delivered solid returns this week. With three hours to go in the week, all three markets were up almost 3% for the week, with the best performer, once again, the technology-heavy Nasdaq. The small cap Russell 2000 Index enjoyed an impressive rally, with the index returning over 9% for the week. The mid-cap S&amp;P 400 Index also had a solid showing, returning almost 9%.\n\n&gt; Amid ongoing COVID-19 disruptions, rising unemployment, and risks associated with reopening the economy, US stocks continued to rebound. The rally was supported by all 50 states easing restrictions, based on improving COIVD-19 trends. Several timely indicators have pointed to a pickup in economic activity, including higher credit and debit card spending and an increase in travelers based on TSA data. Second quarter gross domestic product (GDP) could contract as much as 30% annualized, but global progress in reopening economies combined with massive stimulus measures point to a potentially strong rebound in the third and fourth quarters.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe S&amp;P 500 just had the second-best 40-day rally ever, with only the returns off the March 2009 lows better,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cNear-term, we have some concerns of a well-deserved pullback, but historically, these huge moves have tended to resolve much higher over the ensuing 6- and 12-month periods.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.22.20-wmp.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; In a change of pace, industrials were the top-performing sector for the week, followed by the energy sector. The worst-performing sectors were healthcare and consumer staples, and they posted returns that were slightly negative for the week. Looking at style, large cap value stocks edged out large cap growth for the week.\n\n*****\n\n# Leading Indicators Signal Potential Bottom\n\n&gt; Leading economic indicators are signaling that the pace of economic deterioration may be slowing. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Conference Board\u2019s Leading Economic Index (LEI), a composite of leading data series, fell 4.4% month over month in April. While this is an undeniably abysmal reading, it is an improvement from the -7.4% in March.\n\n&gt; \u201dThe monthly LEI change tends to bottom early in a recession, and sometimes even before a recession\u2019s official start,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cStocks are forward looking, so if investors feel confident that the economic damage will not accelerate from here, they may be more willing to put capital to work. We think today\u2019s LEI number largely confirms April\u2019s strong moves in the equity markets.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Economic-news-5.22.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The performance of the 10 underlying components in the LEI does indicate some disconnect between financial markets and the real economy. The two largest positive contributors to the headline LEI number this month were stock prices and the interest rate spread, which were buoyed by a swift and robust monetary and fiscal stimulus. Meanwhile, data series related to manufacturing, unemployment, and construction hurt the index, a reflection of the damage done to the parts of the economy in which workers are unable to perform their jobs remotely.\n\n&gt; As local economies begin to reopen, we look for the industries disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 virus to begin to rebound. While this will likely be a bumpy process, progress will likely become evident in future LEI releases and confirm that the worst of the economic declines are behind us. We think this should pave the way for further equity gains over a long-term horizon.\n\n*****\n\n# What Happens When The Bear Ends?\n\n&gt; The incredible rally off the March 23 lows continues for equities, with the S&amp;P 500 Index now up more than 32% in 40 trading days. As impressive as the rally has been, we do have some near-term concerns, as we discussed in Downside Risk Remains. Higher valuations, US-/China relations, weakening technicals, and the historically troublesome summer months all could play a part in potential weakness after the record run.\n\n&gt; \u201cIn 40 trading days, the S&amp;P 500 gained 32%, which is second only to the 40 days off the March 2009 lows,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cLooking back at history shows that after the initial surge off of bear lows, stocks tend to correct about 10%, which is something we could see this time around.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 rallied nearly 21% in 30 days after all major bear markets. But once those initial rallies ended, there was a correction of more than 10% on average. Bottoms are a process, and as impressive as this run has been, we think the odds are quite high for some type of pullback or correction over the coming months. Thanks to our friends at Strategas Research Partners for the data points below.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.20.20-blog-chart-2-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Bottom Line EPS Beat Rate Below Average\n\n&gt; The first quarter earnings reporting period unofficially came to an end earlier this week, and it should be considered quite a success given how well the equity market performed during this time period. Since earnings season began on April 13th, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) has gained more than 5%. Of course, the market's performance over the last month or so has much more to do with expectations on re-opening than how companies reported in Q1, but all things considered, the sky didn't fall when it came to earnings results.\n\n&gt; In terms of how actual earnings reports came in versus analyst expectations this past earnings season, the trend wasn't all that rosy. We've been tracking \"beat rates\" for more than a decade, which measure the percentage of companies reporting stronger than expected EPS and sales numbers (relative to consensus analyst estimates). Our main \"beat rate\" trackers show beat rates on a rolling 3-month basis -- meaning it looks at all companies that have reported earnings over the last three months and tells you what percentage of them beat analyst estimates.\n\n&gt; Below is a snapshot of both bottom-line EPS and top-line sales beat rates over the last five years as displayed on our website at our \"Earnings Explorer\" page. Notably, bottom-line EPS beat rates have been weakening quite dramatically over the last couple of months since the COVID crisis began. Just this week, the 3-month rolling EPS beat rate dipped below its long-term average of 59.37% dating back to the year 2000.\n\n&gt; On the other hand, top-line sales beat rates haven't taken quite the hit yet. The current sales beat rate stands at 60.67%. While sales on an absolute basis fell dramatically at the end of Q1, the fact that sales beat rates haven't fallen dramatically means companies have at least managed to keep up with analyst expectations. A very weak sales beat rate would have meant companies were reporting numbers even weaker than already dour analyst expectations.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/epsbeats.png))**\n\n&gt; We also have a forward guidance tracker that measures the percentage of companies raising guidance versus the percentage of companies lowering guidance. When this reading turns negative, it means more companies have lowered guidance than raised guidance over the last three months. As shown below, right now our guidance spread stands at -16.08 percentage points, which is the weakest reading we've seen since early 2016.\n\n&gt; One thing we've seen since the COVID crisis began is that more and more companies have withdrawn guidance altogether. It's hard to blame them. The ones that have issued guidance have mostly lowered expectations. While this paints a bleak picture for the future, if you look at this from a \"glass half full\" perspective, it actually leaves much more room for positive surprises down the road.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/guidance5yr.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Down Five Straight Day After Memorial Day\n\n&gt; Our office will be closed for observance of Memorial Day on Monday, May 25. U.S stock and bond markets will also be closed. As you spend some quality time off please consider taking time to commemorate those who have paid the ultimate price while serving in the U.S. military. Additionally, consider taking a moment to acknowledge first responders, nurses, doctors, law enforcement, firefighters, essential workers, scientists and everyone else that has tirelessly worked and sacrificed during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n&gt; For decades the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac has been tracking and monitoring the market\u2019s performance around holidays. The trading day after Memorial Day has a mixed record going back to 1971. Both S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have declined more often than risen on the day, but average performance is still modestly positive. Since 1986, the frequency of gains has improved, and average performance has also risen however, over the last five years S&amp;P 500 has declined. The second trading day after Memorial Day has more advances than declines, but average performance is negative for NASDAQ. The third day after appears to have the best long- and short-term record combined with solid average performance.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/17c1f2e9847dc9535fcaf9721be1fd15/cf4b21edc88189d8-06/s640x960/e768e94e9f16dd65cdae2b4f8d23f15f1b3806f5.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Election-Year June: Candidate Clarity Boosts Performance\n\n&gt; June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks over the last 49 years as a rule ranking seventh with a 0.8% average gain, up 27 of 49 years. This contributes to NASDAQ\u2019s \u201cBest Eight Months\u201d which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking tenth, but essentially flat (0.1% average gain). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.8% in the month since 1979.\n\n&gt; In election years since 1950, June\u2019s performance improves notably. June is the #5 DJIA month in election years averaging a 0.9% gain with a record of twelve advances in seventeen years. For S&amp;P 500, June is #2 with an average gain of 1.3% (14-3 record). Election-year June ranks #4 for NASDAQ and Russell 2000 with average gains of 1.6% and 1.4% respectively. This performance improvement is most likely the result of presidential candidate field being sufficiently narrowed, and the ultimate nominees being identified.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a72b7e4acd0417756738dc99296c53d9/b62a78126f7fd2f0-07/s400x600/2f93e5e52a2c425a44e8dd371d8628f5cdc01bdf.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$COST** \n&gt; * **$AZO** \n&gt; * **$DG** \n&gt; * **$DLTR** \n&gt; * **$CRM** \n&gt; * **$PLAN** \n&gt; * **$CGC** \n&gt; * **$BNS** \n&gt; * **$OKTA** \n&gt; * **$NIO** \n&gt; * **$RL** \n&gt; * **$WDAY** \n&gt; * **$CBL** \n&gt; * **$MRVL** \n&gt; * **$ESLT** \n&gt; * **$ADSK** \n&gt; * **$HPQ** \n&gt; * **$MOMO** \n&gt; * **$VEEV** \n&gt; * **$HIBB** \n&gt; * **$ZS** \n&gt; * **$ULTA** \n&gt; * **$TD** \n&gt; * **$CSIQ** \n&gt; * **$KEYS** \n&gt; * **$NTNX** \n&gt; * **$PLAB** \n&gt; * **$BMO** \n&gt; * **$BURL** \n&gt; * **$RY** \n&gt; * **$MGIC** \n&gt; * **$BOX** \n&gt; * **$ERJ** \n&gt; * **$ANF** \n&gt; * **$DELL** \n&gt; * **$CYD** \n&gt; * **$PLT** \n&gt; * **$VIPS** \n&gt; * **$COHR** \n&gt; * **$VIOT** \n&gt; * **$NTAP**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Mr8CSMQ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/vZhPWXr.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 5.25.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

        "selftext": "I guarantee it. Went long 400 shares.\n\nWhy not buy calls like a true WSBer? We can't, yet. \n\n\"The closing price of the company's shares in the market must have a minimum per-share price for a majority of trading days during the three prior calendar months. The current minimum price is **$3.00 per share** for \"covered securities\" or $7.50 per share for non-covered securities.\" - CBOE rules\n\nIn case you missed it, NNDM just accomplished a **world-first** in Additive Manufacturing, or \"3D printing\", specifically for high performance and military grade electronics. We're talking about 3D printing thick and durable microchips, with electronics soldered to both sides, meeting the specs for military and ISS use. This has never been done before in history, and the Intellectual Property value here is extraordinary.\n\nhttps://www.nano-di.com/investor-news/hensoldt-and-nano-dimension-achieve-breakthrough-in-electronics-3d-printing\n\n*NNDM owns the patent to both types of \"inks\" used to manufacture this process.* Inks are the material the printer jets out and layers to 3D print an object. 3D printing military-grade, double-sided microchips is especially hard, and this company is now proven to be the best and only in the world.\n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/02/25/1741237/0/en/Nano-Dimension-Receives-Patent-Approval-from-both-the-U-S-and-Korea-Patents-and-Trademark-Offices-for-Innovative-Dielectric-Ink.html\n\nThis accomplishment means NNDM has successfully condensed the laborious production process of the highest performance computer chips in the world into a singular 3D printing unit, the DRAGONFLY LDM, with its **patented inks**: AgCite Nanoparticle Silver Ink\nDielectric Nanoparticle Polymer Ink, being the keys to unlocking this process.\n\nThis news broke Tuesday 5/19. Share price promptly jumps to close at $3.40, (reached $6 AH) after sitting at ~$0.70 for months. NNDM announces 18M direct offering at $2 per share the next day which will only increase outstanding shares from 27M to 25M. These shares hit market tomorrow, but the news is priced in already: closed today at $3.09. Intense volume the last few days, and MM's are now making sure this ticker will be optionable ASAP.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/nano-dimension-prices-35-9-124241223.html\n\nIMO this is a prime buy and solid company: true blue-chip in the making, or a strong buyout target. Their CTO has a remarkable track record as well, and this IP is a game-changer. Once this stock becomes optionable, I'm sure you can imagine the tendies. For now, go long and make THETA work for you. Good luck every gang.\n\nnote on the chart - 1:10 Reverse split in 10/2019. Listed on NASDAQ in 2016, I believe at what would have been $8 at the time. This was indeed a tech penny stock a few weeks ago, trading at $0.07 relative to 2016 (300M initial offering). The true value of its IP has not been realized until the PR 2 days ago. Now, you can buy at the new bedrock: $3.00. Welcome everyone!\n\nPS: if this works out all I'd ask for is a sweet Nano Dimensional Oracle flair.",

        "selftext": " MPWR stock is too good. MPWR was 10% over all time high, even after yesterday's dip. Their stock price is an anomaly in their sector: $SOXX is up 30% from the march drop, still below february highs. MPRWs larger competitors like Analog devices($ADI), Texas Instruments($TXN), ON semiconductor(ON), and Intel show similar gains. This makes sense: these companies make fundamental manufacturing parts and are sensitive to weak global manufacturing and trade. So what makes MPWR so special? What do they do?\n\n90+% of MPWR's business is the design and sale of DC power supply/power converter chips, the rest is similar derived devices like motor drivers and power sensors. They do not actually manufacture chips themselves, instead contracting to semiconductor foundries. The vast majority of their customers are manufacturers of integrated circuits, mostly in china. This risk profile is common in the segment, but it does leave them exposed to China specific market forces like tariffs, quarantines.\n\nTheir product is so universal to electronic devices that they have a very broad customer base in consumer electronics, industrial automation,  automotive, computing and telecom infrastructure. This has insulated them from some of the cyclic boom-bust patterns of the sector, and historically MPWR's performance is consistently better than the semiconductor ETFs $SOXX.\n\nMPWRs recent history shows some decent management moves. 2018 was a banner year for MPWR. They posted 61% year over year profit growth and their stock price mostly traded sideways for the year. They invested heavily until q4 2019 tanked the sector. They were smart enough to see the contraction coming and were able to eke out 1% profit growth through investment returns and executive pay structure deferments. A better than expected Q1 earnings report helped kick them up over 200$.\n\nSo there's stuff to like. Seems like a good buy in the 150-160 range.nce it comes down, and I think it will come down, here's why:\n\nThe most basic indicators are wrong: P/E ratio is 83. This is 4x higher than typical for the sector, 2x higher than is normal for their closest competitors during the best times. Market analysts are not recommending this stock, it's not being pumped on twitter. MPWR stock looked pretty normal until the second week of april until april 9:\n\nAround April 9-10 MPWR begins to diverge from competitor $POSI after a press release announcing they built a ventilator gets picked up by a few news aggregators. I encourage you to go look at this ventilator:\n\nhttps://www.monolithicpower.com/en/mps-open-source-ventilator\n\nThis is not a remotely viable product. It doesn't even offer practical improvements on the open source ventilator it's based on. It's a medium quality arduino project put together using spare parts, lithium batteries, and MPWR off-the shelf hardware. To me this suggests MPWR has engineers and marketing staff short for paying work.\n\nYou have likely noticed ads/speculation/spam about making money from 5G networks and internet infrastructure. After the ventilator story brought attention to MPWR I expect unfamiliar traders began investigating and found MPWR's marketing materials about these products. MPWR makes almost all of its money from 5 markets:\n\n1) Computer/server gear at roughly 30% of their business\n\n2) Consumer Electronics at 25% of their business\n\n3) Industrial/Commercial Devices 15%\n\n4) Embedded Automotive Devices 15%\n\n5) Infrastructure to consumer scale Telecommunications gear, 15%\n\nNone of their markets are in great shape.\n\nComputer and semiconductor markets are projected to shrink this year, even with some cloud growth.  Unemployment is hurting consumer spending and with that Auto/Consumer electronics spending will shrink.  Telecommunications infrastructure spending could grow this year but broad 5g rollout is scheduled at least a year out. Industrial products might have opportunities with new customers who don't already know who they are, but a locked down sales force and the lack of variety in their product development are bad signs: their sales teams will be less effective globally and I don't expect viable new products from their engineering team.\n\nWithout good new revenue lines they'll need to cut costs. Signs point to them being fucked here. They bought a new US facility shortly before the crash/shelter in place. They purchase their silicon wafers in yearly installments based on sales projections, so inventory costs are locked in. They have an abysmal 1.94 inventory turnover ratio. Maybe this is secretly good: sucking that bad suggests ample room for supply chain improvements.\n\nFinally, their  Q1 earnings which kicked the stock to record highs might not be a good indicator of their health during that quarter. Earnings transcripts describe their sales are long cycle collaborations with oems, with orders taking 8-16 weeks to fulfill. With lead times that long new bookings could have dropped 90% during the end of Q1 and the signal wouldn't show up until next quarter.\n\nAlso: an aside: breathing equipment is a saturated and losing game. Thousands of people are working on solutions, but they won't beat the existing ventilator manufacturers. They are competing with tested, regulatory approved products manufactured with purpose built tooling and process. These companies have already multiplied their throughput with quick purchases of tooling and wiped out the supply of valves, instrumentation and raw materials needed to make that gear. The flattening of infection curves points to less gear being needed than was thought. Look for profits in suppliers of these raw parts.($PH)",
