        "selftext": "I'm a moron, and was trying to think of some additional plays should the GME short squeeze start to occur. The first thing that comes to mind is that shorts may have their long positions closed as they get margin called as GME rises - which could cause sell offs in other seemingly unrelated equities. Is this an absolutely stupid strategy?\n\nI went to see what Melvin Capital was holding and what I would liquidate if I was in such a crunch. They seem to have quite a few EXPE calls that are could be deep in the money, they also appear to own approximately 5% of EXPE's shares and 5x of it's average daily volume. As a best guess, they are up 40-50% on this position, so it might be one they would close to cover - and could possibly cause a selloff as a result. They also own a fair amount of FISV and FISV calls, but figure they'd liquidate the calls before they sell any shares. There are a couple other positions I was looking into but wasn't sure it was worth my time.\n\nHowever, other than puts, I did not see a short position listed on on the information I was getting (I just googled Melvin Holdings and checked the first site that didn't charge me to see some of the info from a 9/30/20 13F). Is there some place to confirm MC has short positions and not just puts? Is this a complete waste of time, or is a sell off probable for those that get caught with burnt shorts? Lastly, are there any strategies that would likely be used by a company like MC that would indicate which positions they might close (i.e. FIFO, biggest gain, worst performing, whatever would likely affect prices the least, etc) that might not be something a WSB moron like myself might be aware of?\n\nTLDR: Should I spend time trying to find stocks that might sell off as a result of GME shorts losing leverage as the squeeze takes place, and if so - any recommended (preferably free) websites for accurate information that an ignoramus could use?\n\nPositions: 167 GME shares, 1 short 1/8 $28 C, a couple random GME straddles in the $20-34 range with exp between 1/8 &amp; 7/16, 2 long 7/16 $30 C",

        "selftext": "**Industry Overview**\n\nFinancial institutions are known for their lackluster online/digital experience. Many processes inside of these companies are done manually with paper and can take weeks to process and receive approval. Financial institutions are one of the most risk-averse sets of customers.\n\nBanks and other financial institutions will always be around. Although these companies may look different from today, this industry will always be around. That\u2019s why Buffett invests in banks. As cloud software and the regulatory burden becomes more expensive and time-consuming, financial institutions are looking to improve their processes to be more efficient and please customers.\n\nSimple processes can drag on for weeks in financial institutions. Cloud software, nCino, and nCino\u2019s competitors are helping solve this problem. nCino aims to change these manual processes and make financial institutions more nimble while still being compliant with all regulations.\n\nAccording to Gartner, banking had the highest global enterprise IT spending of all industries with approximately $376 billion spent in 2018. Although nCino only defines its serviceable addressable market at $10bn, the broader IT industry gives nCino a long runway of future potential growth.\n\nnCino has a number of competitors. My initial research shows that nCino competes with Fiserv, Oracle, and other small companies. In order to invest in nCino, a deeper look into the competitive environment will need to be completed.\n\n**Business Overview**\n\nnCino was founded in 2012 by a team of bankers. These founders built a software company solving problems for banks. The founders knew the struggles that often occur inside banks and used their knowledge to solve these problems. nCino is a bank operating system platform. It helps provide banks onboard, originate loans, open accounts, and many other processes. The CEO stated in an interview that \u201che wants the software to do everything from operations, ranging from treasury management to mortgages (coming soon), to tracking employees\u2019 efficiency.\u201d nCino already has relationships with over 305 financial institutions that use the nCino bank operating system, which is their main platform, and then nCino has another 920 financial institutions that use the portfolio analytics solution tool that was acquired in the acquisition of Visible Equity.\n\nnCino has already signed some of the largest financial institutions in the world. nCino boasts Bank of America, Barclays, TD Bank, and many regional community banks, credit unions, and challenger banks as customers.\n\nnCino sells its software on a per-seat basis. This gives it room to continue to expand within its existing customer base. nCino also stands to benefit from capturing more financial institutional clients and expanding their average contract value.  \\`\n\nHere is a list of nCino\u2019s offerings: loan origination, portfolio analytics, compliance and risk management, digital customer engagement, customer relationship management (CRM), client onboarding, deposit account opening, business process automation, and enterprise content management.\n\n**Total Addressable Market**\n\nnCino\u2019s S-1 touts that there are more than 28,000 financial institutions worldwide. Gartner also lists banking as the industry with the highest global enterprise IT spending with approximately $376 billion spent in 2018. The financial industry is one of the largest industries and if nCino can help power even a sliver of this industry, it will be a good future for this company. Of course, I have to caveat this by saying that starting a t-shirt business and capturing 1% of the apparel industry may seem plausible, but it is impossible. I make this statement because nCino already has a strong base of customers and has done the work to capture this pie. This gives it the possibility to capture more market share, not all of it, but more.\n\nThe bull thesis for nCino is to be the main software operating system for banks. As banks become more reliant on technology, nCino will prove to be a critical piece of infrastructure. nCino will also develop more product offerings that help their customers. This enhances the stickiness of nCino and leads to upsell opportunities.\n\nnCino\u2019s management team lists the total serviceable market for nCino\u2019s bank operating system at more than $10bn. I believe this is within reason and management is likely underestimating (on purpose or not) the addressable market they believe they can capture.\n\n**Competitive Advantages**\n\nAlthough I like to be optimistic about companies when researching them, I do think nCino is quite an attractive company based on my research on the qualitative aspects of the business.\n\n* **Mission-critical product with high switching costs.**\n   * The solutions that nCino provides are for mission-critical processes that banks want to be done right. Financial institutions would rather have a manual time-consuming process than an automatic process that goes wrong. Switching costs come into play once customers are comfortable with nCino\u2019s product. As customers rely more and more on nCino, these customers are unlikely to switch.Switching from nCino (or any company) to a competitor may lead to outages, issues, and lots of problems that financial institutions will not risk having to deal with. Even if financial institutions attempt to build out their own bank operating system, it will be costly, prone to error, and not worth it! That\u2019s like trying to build out Stripe if you\u2019re an e-commerce company (@Shopify). Allocating capital to build out this function will make zero sense for financial institutions. It\u2019s better to stick to what you know and what you\u2019re good at. That\u2019s why nCino will have high switching costs.\n* **Economies of scale.**\n   * The cost of building out a suite of software products and deploying it to a large customer base is much cheaper for a large company than a small company. Just like no startup would try and compete directly with Amazon, Shopify, Salesforce, Stripe, etc, as nCino grows, no company will come close to competing in the same fashion due to their scale benefits.As nCino looks to expand its product offering, the attractiveness of nCino\u2019s products to financial institutions will only grow. Financial institutions, a very risk-averse set of customers, want products that have been vetted by other financial institutions and have offerings that solve critical problems.\n\n**Financials**\n\nLike many SaaS companies, nCino has two primary revenue lines. The first is recurring revenue similar to most SaaS companies. The second revenue source is professional services revenue. Subscription revenue accounts for the majority of revenue and gross profit.\n\n**January 2020:**\n\nTotal revenue = \\~$138mn\n\nGAAP Gross profit = \\~$74mn\n\nSubscription revenue = \\~$103mn\n\nSubscription revenue growth = \\~60%\n\nSubscription gross profit margin = \\~70%\n\nGAAP EBIT margin = -20%\n\n**January 2019:**\n\nTotal revenue = \\~$92mn\n\nGAAP Gross profit = \\~$45mn\n\nSubscription revenue = \\~$64mn\n\nSubscription revenue growth = \\~69%\n\nSubscription gross profit margin = \\~69%\n\nGAAP EBIT margin = -25%\n\n**January 2018:**\n\nTotal revenue = \\~$58mn\n\nGAAP Gross profit = \\~$28mn\n\nSubscription revenue = \\~$38mn\n\nSubscription revenue growth = N/A\n\nSubscription gross profit margin = \\~67%\n\nGAAP EBIT margin = -32%\n\nAlthough nCino is not profitable on a GAAP basis like many of its software peers, the attractiveness of the growth story is compelling. More research into unit economics may provide an even more compelling story.\n\n**What\u2019s Interesting**\n\nThe financial industry is a risk-averse industry and usually, one of the last industries to adapt to change. This is changing with the increasing adoption of technology and software. The innovation occurring in FinTech and in financial institutions is growing. If nCino can be one of the main companies to be the operating system for banks (just like Microsoft/Salesforce is to most companies) then nCino may be an attractive investment opportunity.\n\nSalesforce also owns a large portion of nCino. nCino relies on the \u201cSalesforce Platform.\u201d Also, this may initially seem like a concern, Salesforce also owns 11.6% of nCino. It wouldn\u2019t make much sense for Salesforce to stop nCino from using the Salesforce Platform if they own such a material stake in the company.\n\nSome of the hedge funds that I follow ([Link](https://twitter.com/StratusYoung/status/1327453755583893505)) have positions in nCino which is what initially attracted me to this business. Hedge funds like Dragoneer, Tiger Global, and Durable Capital have a position in nCino. Sure these positions may just be small positions to take advantage of the tech IPO pop, but future quarters will show if this is a long-term position for these funds.\n\n**Future Questions**\n\n* **Competition**\n   * In order to be more confident in nCino, I\u2019d have to know more about the banking industry and the various competitors and similar nCino product offerings. Through my research, I found some competitors, but little to no information on these companies because they are private or are just not in the typical VC crowd.I also am not sure how hard it would be for Salesforce, Microsoft, or another well-funded company to try and launch similar product offerings to nCino. It seems from first glance that nCino has a strong suite of products, but not sure if this is something they\u2019ve built over time or is from the founders\u2019 background in banking. I doubt Salesforce would try and compete directly with nCino but may form some type of ongoing partnership.\n* **Ownership**\n   * I like to see management teams with large ownership stakes in the businesses they run. With nCino, I don\u2019t see a large ownership stake. Although there were a number of founders and thus each founder has a small stake in nCino, the largest positions by far are owned by Insight Partners, Salesforce, and Wellington. I will need to do more research on digging into the ownership structure and see whether or not management is being incentivized alongside public investors.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI think nCino is a strong company and in my opinion, it\u2019s one of the more attractive investment opportunities from the companies I\u2019ve outlined in the past. The financial industry is huge and if nCino can continue to innovate, build products, upsell existing customers, and sign contracts with new customers, I think nCino may be a stock that people will be talking about in 3-5 years.\n\nIt\u2019s had very strong growth thus far and likely will continue. Of course, the valuation is a key point with some concerns over the high multiple, but relative to similar high growth/high margin comparable companies, nCino fits into this bucket.",

It took me almost a year to develop it to my standard.\n* My private codes was used to develop it, and it's very unlikely I will sell it off to anyone or publish the code freely as it took me way too long to develop it. I rather post updates freely, at no cost to anyone than give out the code.\n* I will not be posting this hourly. It just too long to load everything up maybe in the future. I will post during open though.\n* Discord and telegram admins, don't try to monetize my bot suggestions to vulnerable people, when you don't even own the codes behind it.\n* There are a lot of SPY500/\"boomer\" companies within the bot, I thought about removing it but many people preferred that I kept it in there.\n* There won't be any sell signals, as stocks only go up, so I rather just do a discount algorithm.\n* Batch 1 = Algorithm/Bot + Human Judgement\n* Batch 2 = Algorithm/Bot Judgement Only\n* This is a one man bot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bot Overview**:\n\nIt's showing an opportunity that you may have missed otherwise, so you can decide for yourself if you want to pursue the discount of a stock for potential profits. Backtesting has not been done, do not YOLO your life savings into whatever stated risking it all.  Rather use this as a side tool.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Key:**\n\n* Pharma companies are very risky.\n* Meme/Hype stocks are very risky.\n* Companies that you don't know how they work are very risky.\n* Follower companies are very risky because they join the hype train (what NKLA is to TSLA).\n* I have a very low amount in options (less than $500), and I have 100k+ in shares and cash.\n* When doing options have a lot of collateral, so you don't hit margin call.\n* Take the \"Calls\" as very discounted, and \"Potentially A Call\" as somewhat discounted.\n* Old money companies are slow. While tech companies are fast-paced.\n* Only invest in companies that you do know and see potential in.\n* You don't have to invest every day, only when you see the potential.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;***At Close of Thursday***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Batch 1:**\n\n* Data Processing &amp; Outsourced Services\tMA\tMastercard Inc\n* Financial Exchanges &amp; Data\tMKTX\tMarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n* Financial Exchanges &amp; Data\tMSCI\tMsci Inc\n* BMS\tBraemar Shipping Services plc\n* CSRA\tCisadane Sawit Raya PT\n\n*Maybe*:\n\n* CRSR\tCorsair Gaming Inc\n* TWTR\tTwitter Inc\n* Data Processing &amp; Outsourced Services\tFLT\tFleetCor Technologies, Inc.\n* Data Processing &amp; Outsourced Services\tGPN\tGlobal Payments Inc\n* Data Processing &amp; Outsourced Services\tJKHY\tJack Henry &amp; Associates, Inc.\n* Environmental &amp; Facilities Services\tROL\tRollins, Inc.\n* Financial Exchanges &amp; Data\tCME\tCME Group Inc\n* Health Care Equipment\tBDX\tBecton Dickinson and Co\n* Health Care Equipment\tDXCM\tDexCom, Inc.\n* Industrial Conglomerates\tROP\tRoper Technologies Inc\n* Interactive Media &amp; Services\tTWTR\tTwitter Inc\n* Internet Services &amp; Infrastructure\tVRSN\tVerisign, Inc.\n* Managed Health Care\tHUM\tHumana Inc\n* Pharmaceuticals\tPRGO\tPerrigo Company PLC\n* Restaurants\tDPZ\tDomino's Pizza, Inc.\n* Restaurants\tMCD\tMcdonald's Corp\n* Research &amp; Consulting Services\tINFO\tIHS Markit Ltd\n* TYL\tTyler Technologies, Inc.\n* DPZ\tDomino's Pizza, Inc.\n* DXCM\tDexCom, Inc.\n* JKHY\tJack Henry &amp; Associates, Inc.\n* GPN\tGlobal Payments Inc\n* FB\tFacebook, Inc.

        "selftext": "**Industry Overview**\n\nFinancial institutions are known for their lackluster online/digital experience. Many processes inside of these companies are done manually with paper and can take weeks to process and receive approval. Financial institutions are one of the most risk-averse sets of customers. \n\nBanks and other financial institutions will always be around. Although these companies may look different from today, this industry will always be around. That\u2019s why Buffett invests in banks. As cloud software and the regulatory burden becomes more expensive and time-consuming, financial institutions are looking to improve their processes to be more efficient and please customers. \n\nSimple processes can drag on for weeks in financial institutions. Cloud software, nCino, and nCino\u2019s competitors are helping solve this problem. nCino aims to change these manual processes and make financial institutions more nimble while still being compliant with all regulations. \n\nAccording to Gartner, banking had the highest global enterprise IT spending of all industries with approximately $376 billion spent in 2018. Although nCino only defines its serviceable addressable market at $10bn, the broader IT industry gives nCino a long runway of future potential growth. \n\nnCino has a number of competitors. My initial research shows that nCino competes with Fiserv, Oracle, and other small companies. In order to invest in nCino, a deeper look into the competitive environment will need to be completed.  \n\n**Business Overview**\n\nnCino was founded in 2012 by a team of bankers. These founders built a software company solving problems for banks. The founders knew the struggles that often occur inside banks and used their knowledge to solve these problems. nCino is a bank operating system platform. It helps provide banks onboard, originate loans, open accounts, and many other processes. The CEO stated in an interview that \u201che wants the software to do everything from operations, ranging from treasury management to mortgages (coming soon), to tracking employees\u2019 efficiency.\u201d nCino already has relationships with over 305 financial institutions that use the nCino bank operating system, which is their main platform, and then nCino has another 920 financial institutions that use the portfolio analytics solution tool that was acquired in the acquisition of Visible Equity. \n\nnCino has already signed some of the largest financial institutions in the world. nCino boasts Bank of America, Barclays, TD Bank, and many regional community banks, credit unions, and challenger banks as customers. \n\nnCino sells its software on a per-seat basis. This gives it room to continue to expand within its existing customer base. nCino also stands to benefit from capturing more financial institutional clients and expanding their average contract value.\n\nHere is a list of nCino\u2019s offerings: loan origination, portfolio analytics, compliance and risk management, digital customer engagement, customer relationship management (CRM), client onboarding, deposit account opening, business process automation, and enterprise content management. \n\n**Total Addressable Market**\n\nnCino\u2019s S-1 touts that there are more than 28,000 financial institutions worldwide. Gartner also lists banking as the industry with the highest global enterprise IT spending with approximately $376 billion spent in 2018. The financial industry is one of the largest industries and if nCino can help power even a sliver of this industry, it will be a good future for this company. Of course, I have to caveat this by saying that starting a t-shirt business and capturing 1% of the apparel industry may seem plausible, but it is impossible. I make this statement because nCino already has a strong base of customers and has done the work to capture this pie. This gives it the possibility to capture more market share, not all of it, but more. \n\nThe bull thesis for nCino is to be the main software operating system for banks. As banks become more reliant on technology, nCino will prove to be a critical piece of infrastructure. nCino will also develop more product offerings that help their customers. This enhances the stickiness of nCino and leads to upsell opportunities. \n\nnCino\u2019s management team lists the total serviceable market for nCino\u2019s bank operating system at more than $10bn. I believe this is within reason and management is likely underestimating (on purpose or not) the addressable market they believe they can capture. \n\n**Competitive Advantages**\n\nAlthough I like to be optimistic about companies when researching them, I do think nCino is quite an attractive company based on my research on the qualitative aspects of the business.\n\n* **Mission-critical product with high switching costs.**\n   * The solutions that nCino provides are for mission-critical processes that banks want to be done right. Financial institutions would rather have a manual time-consuming process than an automatic process that goes wrong. Switching costs come into play once customers are comfortable with nCino\u2019s product. As customers rely more and more on nCino, these customers are unlikely to switch. Switching from nCino (or any company) to a competitor may lead to outages, issues, and lots of problems that financial institutions will not risk having to deal with. Even if financial institutions attempt to build out their own bank operating system, it will be costly, prone to error, and not worth it! That\u2019s like trying to build out Stripe if you\u2019re an e-commerce company (@Shopify). Allocating capital to build out this function will make zero sense for financial institutions. It\u2019s better to stick to what you know and what you\u2019re good at. That\u2019s why nCino will have high switching costs.\n* **Economies of scale.**\n   * The cost of building out a suite of software products and deploying it to a large customer base is much cheaper for a large company than a small company. Just like no startup would try and compete directly with Amazon, Shopify, Salesforce, Stripe, etc, as nCino grows, no company will come close to competing in the same fashion due to their scale benefits.     As nCino looks to expand its product offering, the attractiveness of nCino\u2019s products to financial institutions will only grow. Financial institutions, a very risk-averse set of customers, want products that have been vetted by other financial institutions, and have offerings that solve critical problems.\n\n**Financials**\n\nLike many SaaS companies, nCino has two primary revenue lines. The first is recurring revenue similar to most SaaS companies. The second revenue source is professional services revenue. Subscription revenue accounts for the majority of revenue and gross profit. \n\n**January 2020:**\n\nTotal revenue = \\~$138mn\n\nGAAP Gross profit = \\~$74mn\n\nSubscription revenue = \\~$103mn\n\nSubscription revenue growth = \\~60%\n\nSubscription gross profit margin = \\~70%\n\nGAAP EBIT margin = -20%\n\n**January 2019:**\n\nTotal revenue = \\~$92mn\n\nGAAP Gross profit = \\~$45mn\n\nSubscription revenue = \\~$64mn\n\nSubscription revenue growth = \\~69%\n\nSubscription gross profit margin = \\~69%\n\nGAAP EBIT margin = -25%\n\n**January 2018:**\n\nTotal revenue = \\~$58mn\n\nGAAP Gross profit = \\~$28mn\n\nSubscription revenue = \\~$38mn\n\nSubscription revenue growth = N/A\n\nSubscription gross profit margin = \\~67%\n\nGAAP EBIT margin = -32%\n\nAlthough nCino is not profitable on a GAAP basis like many of its software peers, the attractiveness of the growth story is compelling. More research into unit economics may provide an even more compelling story. \n\n**What\u2019s Interesting**\n\nThe financial industry is a risk-averse industry and usually, one of the last industries to adapt to change. This is changing with the increasing adoption of technology and software. The innovation occurring in FinTech and in financial institutions is growing. If nCino can be one of the main companies to be the operating system for banks (just like Microsoft/Salesforce is to most companies) then nCino may be an attractive investment opportunity. \n\nSalesforce also owns a large portion of nCino. nCino relies on the \u201cSalesforce Platform.\u201d Also, this may initially seem like a concern, Salesforce also owns 11.6% of nCino. It wouldn\u2019t make much sense for Salesforce to stop nCino from using the Salesforce Platform if they own such a material stake in the company. \n\nSome of the hedge funds that I follow have positions in nCino which is what initially attracted me to this business. Hedge funds like Dragoneer, Tiger Global, and Durable Capital have a position in nCino. Sure these positions may just be small positions to take advantage of the tech IPO pop, but future quarters will show if this is a long-term position for these funds. \n\n**Future Questions**\n\n* **Competition**\n   * In order to be more confident in nCino, I\u2019d have to know more about the banking industry and the various competitors and similar nCino product offerings. Through my research, I found some competitors, but little to no information on these companies because they are private or are just not in the typical VC crowd.  I also am not sure how hard it would be for Salesforce, Microsoft, or another well-funded company to try and launch similar product offerings to nCino. It seems from first glance that nCino has a strong suite of products, but not sure if this is something they\u2019ve built over time or is from the founders\u2019 background in banking. I doubt Salesforce would try and compete directly with nCino but may form some type of ongoing partnership.   \n* **Ownership**\n   * I like to see management teams with large ownership stakes in the businesses they run. With nCino, I don\u2019t see a large ownership stake. Although there were a number of founders and thus each founder has a small stake in nCino, the largest positions by far are owned by Insight Partners, Salesforce, and Wellington. I will need to do more research on digging into the ownership structure and see whether or not management is being incentivized alongside public investors.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI think nCino is a strong company and in my opinion, it\u2019s one of the more attractive investment opportunities from the companies I\u2019ve outlined in the past. The financial industry is huge and if nCino can continue to innovate, build products, upsell existing customers, and sign contracts with new customers, I think nCino may be a stock that people will be talking about in 3-5 years. \n\nIt\u2019s had very strong growth thus far and likely will continue. Of course, the valuation is a key point with some concerns over the high multiple, but relative to similar high growth/high margin comparable companies, nCino fits into this bucket.",

        "selftext": "**Industry Overview**\n\nFinancial institutions are known for their lackluster online/digital experience. Many processes inside of these companies are done manually with paper and can take weeks to process and receive approval. Financial institutions are one of the most risk-averse sets of customers.\n\nBanks and other financial institutions will always be around. Although these companies may look different from today, this industry will always be around. That\u2019s why Buffett invests in banks. As cloud software and the regulatory burden becomes more expensive and time-consuming, financial institutions are looking to improve their processes to be more efficient and please customers.\n\nSimple processes can drag on for weeks in financial institutions. Cloud software, nCino, and nCino\u2019s competitors are helping solve this problem. nCino aims to change these manual processes and make financial institutions more nimble while still being compliant with all regulations.\n\nAccording to Gartner, banking had the highest global enterprise IT spending of all industries with approximately $376 billion spent in 2018. Although nCino only defines its serviceable addressable market at $10bn, the broader IT industry gives nCino a long runway of future potential growth.\n\nnCino has a number of competitors. My initial research shows that nCino competes with Fiserv, Oracle, and other small companies. In order to invest in nCino, a deeper look into the competitive environment will need to be completed.\n\n**Business Overview**\n\nnCino was founded in 2012 by a team of bankers. These founders built a software company solving problems for banks. The founders knew the struggles that often occur inside banks and used their knowledge to solve these problems. nCino is a bank operating system platform. It helps provide banks onboard, originate loans, open accounts, and many other processes. The CEO stated in an interview that \u201che wants the software to do everything from operations, ranging from treasury management to mortgages (coming soon), to tracking employees\u2019 efficiency.\u201d nCino already has relationships with over 305 financial institutions that use the nCino bank operating system, which is their main platform, and then nCino has another 920 financial institutions that use the portfolio analytics solution tool that was acquired in the acquisition of Visible Equity.\n\nnCino has already signed some of the largest financial institutions in the world. nCino boasts Bank of America, Barclays, TD Bank, and many regional community banks, credit unions, and challenger banks as customers.\n\nnCino sells its software on a per-seat basis. This gives it room to continue to expand within its existing customer base. nCino also stands to benefit from capturing more financial institutional clients and expanding their average contract value.\n\nHere is a list of nCino\u2019s offerings: loan origination, portfolio analytics, compliance and risk management, digital customer engagement, customer relationship management (CRM), client onboarding, deposit account opening, business process automation, and enterprise content management.\n\n**Total Addressable Market**\n\nnCino\u2019s S-1 touts that there are more than 28,000 financial institutions worldwide. Gartner also lists banking as the industry with the highest global enterprise IT spending with approximately $376 billion spent in 2018. The financial industry is one of the largest industries and if nCino can help power even a sliver of this industry, it will be a good future for this company. Of course, I have to caveat this by saying that starting a t-shirt business and capturing 1% of the apparel industry may seem plausible, but it is impossible. I make this statement because nCino already has a strong base of customers and has done the work to capture this pie. This gives it the possibility to capture more market share, not all of it, but more.\n\nThe bull thesis for nCino is to be the main software operating system for banks. As banks become more reliant on technology, nCino will prove to be a critical piece of infrastructure. nCino will also develop more product offerings that help their customers. This enhances the stickiness of nCino and leads to upsell opportunities.\n\nnCino\u2019s management team lists the total serviceable market for nCino\u2019s bank operating system at more than $10bn. I believe this is within reason and management is likely underestimating (on purpose or not) the addressable market they believe they can capture.\n\n**Competitive Advantages**\n\nAlthough I like to be optimistic about companies when researching them, I do think nCino is quite an attractive company based on my research on the qualitative aspects of the business.\n\n* **Mission-critical product with high switching costs.**\n   * The solutions that nCino provides are for mission-critical processes that banks want to be done right. Financial institutions would rather have a manual time-consuming process than an automatic process that goes wrong. Switching costs come into play once customers are comfortable with nCino\u2019s product. As customers rely more and more on nCino, these customers are unlikely to switch. Switching from nCino (or any company) to a competitor may lead to outages, issues, and lots of problems that financial institutions will not risk having to deal with. Even if financial institutions attempt to build out their own bank operating system, it will be costly, prone to error, and not worth it! That\u2019s like trying to build out Stripe if you\u2019re an e-commerce company (@Shopify). Allocating capital to build out this function will make zero sense for financial institutions. It\u2019s better to stick to what you know and what you\u2019re good at. That\u2019s why nCino will have high switching costs.\n* **Economies of scale.**\n   * The cost of building out a suite of software products and deploying it to a large customer base is much cheaper for a large company than a small company. Just like no startup would try and compete directly with Amazon, Shopify, Salesforce, Stripe, etc, as nCino grows, no company will come close to competing in the same fashion due to their scale benefits. As nCino looks to expand its product offering, the attractiveness of nCino\u2019s products to financial institutions will only grow. Financial institutions, a very risk-averse set of customers, want products that have been vetted by other financial institutions, and have offerings that solve critical problems.\n\n**Financials**\n\nLike many SaaS companies, nCino has two primary revenue lines. The first is recurring revenue similar to most SaaS companies. The second revenue source is professional services revenue. Subscription revenue accounts for the majority of revenue and gross profit.\n\n**January 2020:**\n\nTotal revenue = \\~$138mn\n\nGAAP Gross profit = \\~$74mn\n\nSubscription revenue = \\~$103mn\n\nSubscription revenue growth = \\~60%\n\nSubscription gross profit margin = \\~70%\n\nGAAP EBIT margin = -20%\n\n**January 2019:**\n\nTotal revenue = \\~$92mn\n\nGAAP Gross profit = \\~$45mn\n\nSubscription revenue = \\~$64mn\n\nSubscription revenue growth = \\~69%\n\nSubscription gross profit margin = \\~69%\n\nGAAP EBIT margin = -25%\n\n**January 2018:**\n\nTotal revenue = \\~$58mn\n\nGAAP Gross profit = \\~$28mn\n\nSubscription revenue = \\~$38mn\n\nSubscription revenue growth = N/A\n\nSubscription gross profit margin = \\~67%\n\nGAAP EBIT margin = -32%\n\nAlthough nCino is not profitable on a GAAP basis like many of its software peers, the attractiveness of the growth story is compelling. More research into unit economics may provide an even more compelling story.\n\n**What\u2019s Interesting**\n\nThe financial industry is a risk-averse industry and usually, one of the last industries to adapt to change. This is changing with the increasing adoption of technology and software. The innovation occurring in FinTech and in financial institutions is growing. If nCino can be one of the main companies to be the operating system for banks (just like Microsoft/Salesforce is to most companies) then nCino may be an attractive investment opportunity.\n\nSalesforce also owns a large portion of nCino. nCino relies on the \u201cSalesforce Platform.\u201d Also, this may initially seem like a concern, Salesforce also owns 11.6% of nCino. It wouldn\u2019t make much sense for Salesforce to stop nCino from using the Salesforce Platform if they own such a material stake in the company.\n\nSome of the hedge funds that I follow have positions in nCino which is what initially attracted me to this business. Hedge funds like Dragoneer, Tiger Global, and Durable Capital have a position in nCino. Sure these positions may just be small positions to take advantage of the tech IPO pop, but future quarters will show if this is a long-term position for these funds.\n\n**Future Questions**\n\n* **Competition**\n   * In order to be more confident in nCino, I\u2019d have to know more about the banking industry and the various competitors and similar nCino product offerings. Through my research, I found some competitors, but little to no information on these companies because they are private or are just not in the typical VC crowd. I also am not sure how hard it would be for Salesforce, Microsoft, or another well-funded company to try and launch similar product offerings to nCino. It seems from first glance that nCino has a strong suite of products, but not sure if this is something they\u2019ve built over time or is from the founders\u2019 background in banking. I doubt Salesforce would try and compete directly with nCino but may form some type of ongoing partnership.\n* **Ownership**\n   * I like to see management teams with large ownership stakes in the businesses they run. With nCino, I don\u2019t see a large ownership stake. Although there were a number of founders and thus each founder has a small stake in nCino, the largest positions by far are owned by Insight Partners, Salesforce, and Wellington. I will need to do more research on digging into the ownership structure and see whether or not management is being incentivized alongside public investors.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI think nCino is a strong company and in my opinion, it\u2019s one of the more attractive investment opportunities from the companies I\u2019ve outlined in the past. The financial industry is huge and if nCino can continue to innovate, build products, upsell existing customers, and sign contracts with new customers, I think nCino may be a stock that people will be talking about in 3-5 years.\n\nIt\u2019s had very strong growth thus far and likely will continue. Of course, the valuation is a key point with some concerns over the high multiple, but relative to similar high growth/high margin comparable companies, nCino fits into this bucket.",

It seems from first glance that nCino has a strong suite of products, but not sure if this is something they\u2019ve built over time or is from the founders\u2019 background in banking. I doubt Salesforce would try and compete directly with nCino but may form some type of ongoing partnership.   \n* **Ownership**\n   * I like to see management teams with large ownership stakes in the businesses they run.

I will need to do more research on digging into the ownership structure and see whether or not management is being incentivized alongside public investors.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI think nCino is a strong company and in my opinion, it\u2019s one of the more attractive investment opportunities from the companies I\u2019ve outlined in the past. The financial industry is huge and if nCino can continue to innovate, build products, upsell existing customers, and sign contracts with new customers, I think nCino may be a stock that people will be talking about in 3-5 years. \n\nIt\u2019s had very strong growth thus far and likely will continue. Of course, the valuation is a key point with some concerns over the high multiple, but relative to similar high growth/high margin comparable companies, nCino fits into this bucket.",

        "selftext": "**Industry Overview**\n\nFinancial institutions are known for their lackluster online/digital experience. Many processes inside of these companies are done manually with paper and can take weeks to process and receive approval. Financial institutions are one of the most risk-averse sets of customers.\n\nBanks and other financial institutions will always be around. Although these companies may look different from today, this industry will always be around. That\u2019s why Buffett invests in banks. As cloud software and the regulatory burden becomes more expensive and time-consuming, financial institutions are looking to improve their processes to be more efficient and please customers.\n\nSimple processes can drag on for weeks in financial institutions. Cloud software, nCino, and nCino\u2019s competitors are helping solve this problem. nCino aims to change these manual processes and make financial institutions more nimble while still being compliant with all regulations.\n\nAccording to Gartner, banking had the highest global enterprise IT spending of all industries with approximately $376 billion spent in 2018. Although nCino only defines its serviceable addressable market at $10bn, the broader IT industry gives nCino a long runway of future potential growth.\n\nnCino has a number of competitors. My initial research shows that nCino competes with Fiserv, Oracle, and other small companies. In order to invest in nCino, a deeper look into the competitive environment will need to be completed.\n\n**Business Overview**\n\nnCino was founded in 2012 by a team of bankers. These founders built a software company solving problems for banks. The founders knew the struggles that often occur inside banks and used their knowledge to solve these problems. nCino is a bank operating system platform. It helps provide banks onboard, originate loans, open accounts, and many other processes. The CEO stated in an interview that \u201che wants the software to do everything from operations, ranging from treasury management to mortgages (coming soon), to tracking employees\u2019 efficiency.\u201d nCino already has relationships with over 305 financial institutions that use the nCino bank operating system, which is their main platform, and then nCino has another 920 financial institutions that use the portfolio analytics solution tool that was acquired in the acquisition of Visible Equity.\n\nnCino has already signed some of the largest financial institutions in the world. nCino boasts Bank of America, Barclays, TD Bank, and many regional community banks, credit unions, and challenger banks as customers.\n\nnCino sells its software on a per-seat basis. This gives it room to continue to expand within its existing customer base. nCino also stands to benefit from capturing more financial institutional clients and expanding their average contract value.\n\nHere is a list of nCino\u2019s offerings: loan origination, portfolio analytics, compliance and risk management, digital customer engagement, customer relationship management (CRM), client onboarding, deposit account opening, business process automation, and enterprise content management.\n\n**Total Addressable Market**\n\nnCino\u2019s S-1 touts that there are more than 28,000 financial institutions worldwide. Gartner also lists banking as the industry with the highest global enterprise IT spending with approximately $376 billion spent in 2018. The financial industry is one of the largest industries and if nCino can help power even a sliver of this industry, it will be a good future for this company. Of course, I have to caveat this by saying that starting a t-shirt business and capturing 1% of the apparel industry may seem plausible, but it is impossible. I make this statement because nCino already has a strong base of customers and has done the work to capture this pie. This gives it the possibility to capture more market share, not all of it, but more.\n\nThe bull thesis for nCino is to be the main software operating system for banks. As banks become more reliant on technology, nCino will prove to be a critical piece of infrastructure. nCino will also develop more product offerings that help their customers. This enhances the stickiness of nCino and leads to upsell opportunities.\n\nnCino\u2019s management team lists the total serviceable market for nCino\u2019s bank operating system at more than $10bn. I believe this is within reason and management is likely underestimating (on purpose or not) the addressable market they believe they can capture.\n\n**Competitive Advantages**\n\nAlthough I like to be optimistic about companies when researching them, I do think nCino is quite an attractive company based on my research on the qualitative aspects of the business.\n\n* **Mission-critical product with high switching costs.**\n   * The solutions that nCino provides are for mission-critical processes that banks want to be done right. Financial institutions would rather have a manual time-consuming process than an automatic process that goes wrong. Switching costs come into play once customers are comfortable with nCino\u2019s product. As customers rely more and more on nCino, these customers are unlikely to switch. Switching from nCino (or any company) to a competitor may lead to outages, issues, and lots of problems that financial institutions will not risk having to deal with. Even if financial institutions attempt to build out their own bank operating system, it will be costly, prone to error, and not worth it! That\u2019s like trying to build out Stripe if you\u2019re an e-commerce company (@Shopify). Allocating capital to build out this function will make zero sense for financial institutions. It\u2019s better to stick to what you know and what you\u2019re good at. That\u2019s why nCino will have high switching costs.\n* **Economies of scale.**\n   * The cost of building out a suite of software products and deploying it to a large customer base is much cheaper for a large company than a small company. Just like no startup would try and compete directly with Amazon, Shopify, Salesforce, Stripe, etc, as nCino grows, no company will come close to competing in the same fashion due to their scale benefits. As nCino looks to expand its product offering, the attractiveness of nCino\u2019s products to financial institutions will only grow. Financial institutions, a very risk-averse set of customers, want products that have been vetted by other financial institutions, and have offerings that solve critical problems.\n\n**Financials**\n\nLike many SaaS companies, nCino has two primary revenue lines. The first is recurring revenue similar to most SaaS companies. The second revenue source is professional services revenue. Subscription revenue accounts for the majority of revenue and gross profit.\n\n**January 2020:**\n\nTotal revenue = \\~$138mn\n\nGAAP Gross profit = \\~$74mn\n\nSubscription revenue = \\~$103mn\n\nSubscription revenue growth = \\~60%\n\nSubscription gross profit margin = \\~70%\n\nGAAP EBIT margin = -20%\n\n**January 2019:**\n\nTotal revenue = \\~$92mn\n\nGAAP Gross profit = \\~$45mn\n\nSubscription revenue = \\~$64mn\n\nSubscription revenue growth = \\~69%\n\nSubscription gross profit margin = \\~69%\n\nGAAP EBIT margin = -25%\n\n**January 2018:**\n\nTotal revenue = \\~$58mn\n\nGAAP Gross profit = \\~$28mn\n\nSubscription revenue = \\~$38mn\n\nSubscription revenue growth = N/A\n\nSubscription gross profit margin = \\~67%\n\nGAAP EBIT margin = -32%\n\nAlthough nCino is not profitable on a GAAP basis like many of its software peers, the attractiveness of the growth story is compelling.

I have no positions in Okta at the moment.\n\n**OKTA - General Description**\n\nThe company can be seen as providing Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) and is one of the leading companies in the IDaaS market. Okta primarily focusses on 6 main industries: Healthcare, Public Sector, Education, Energy, Financial Services and Technology providing their services to more than 9400 small, medium and large enterprises worldwide.\n\nOkta's main product is the Okta Identity Cloud which is comprised of 6 platform services:\n\n    Directories: stores users and attributes\n    \n    Integrations: ensures that apps (currently 6500+) can connect to Okta\n    \n    Insights: aggregates, analyses and disseminates data from Okta and its partners\n    \n    Identity Engine: customizable access experiences like authorization, authentication and registration\n    \n    Workflows: automates identity-centric processes\n    \n    Devices: collects device identity and context\n\nThese platform services can be leveraged using Okta's products, API's and SDK's like:\n\n    Single Sign On\n    Universal Directory\n    Advanced Server Access\n    Adaptive Multi-actor Authentication\n    Lifecycle Management\n    Access Gateway\n    API Access Management\n    Developer\n    One App\n    Enterprise\n\n**Okta Integration Platform**\n\nThe biggest part that makes Okta a key player is the fact that they integrated 6500+ applications into their cloud and on-premises systems which ensure that on all aspects, an organization can secure their processes. They integrated:\n\n* Human Resources Information Systems like bambooHR and Workday\n* Network Security like Cisco, PaloAlto and Fortinet\n* Application Delivery Controllers like F5, Akamai and Citrix Netsclar\n* Security Analytics like Splunk, Rapid1, IBM QRadar\n* Cloud Access Security Brokers like Bitglass and McAfee\n* API Gateways like AWS, Google Cloud, Apigee\n* Identity Governance and Administration like SailPoint\n* ID Proofing like Acuant, Evident and Experian\n* Privileged Access Management like BeyondTrust and CyberArk\n* Endpoint Security and Management like IBM, MobileIron and VMware\n* Healthcare Technologies like Cerner and AthenaHealth\n* Protocol Based Custom Integrations like Radius, LDAP and SAML\n* Bot Detection like Arkose Labs, Shape and Perimeter\n* Customer Data Integrators like Segment\n* Email Security like ProofPoint\n* SaaS Management Platforms like BetterCloud and Intello\n\nI've made this list, to show how versatile and broad their product is. They ensure that their single product can be used for a multitude of cases within the Workforce Identity, Customer Identity and Access Management market segments.\n\n**How they make money**\n\nOkta's business model follows a SaaS-based delivery model in which business subscribe to Okta's services and pay a fee per user per month. Okta's subscription revenues in the 9 months ending 10/31/2020 jumped 50% YoY to $571.2M.\n\n**Financials &amp; Valuations (as of** [10/31/2020](https://investor.okta.com/news-releases/news-release-details/okta-announces-strong-third-quarter-results)**):**\n\n* Current Market Capitalization (as of 1/15/2021) - $32.75B\n* Total Revenue (3 months): $217,379,000\n* Total Revenue (9 months): $600,684,000\n* Net Profit (Loss) \u2013 3 months: ($72,764,000) \u2013 Up from ($63,495,000)\n* Net Profit (Loss) \u2013 9 months: ($190,526,00) \u2013 Up from ($158,441,000)\n* Cash on Hand: $2.945B\n\n**Growth &amp; Opportunities**\n\nOkta is one of the companies that greatly benefited from the lockdowns all over the world, and the subsequent rise in the need for identity and access management services triggered by the  work-from-home wave. The company's momentum will highly likely continue through fiscal 2021 and beyond, with more and more companies looking to ensure safe and secure work-from-home environments that protects companies, their employees and their customers. CFO Bill Losch said on the company's third-quarter [earnings call](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/earnings),  \"We remain confident that the factors that are driving our business today will continue to drive our business well into the future.\"\n\nJust recently, [Okta's products were made available in the AWS Marketplace](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201202005943/en/Okta-and-Amazon-Web-Services-Bring-the-Okta-Identity-Cloud-to-AWS-Marketplace). It is expected that this move will drive top-line growth.\n\nOkta estimates that it will end fiscal 2021 with revenue of about $822.5 million, an increase of 40% from the previous year, and that it will surpass $1 billion in sales in fiscal 2022. Although Okta isn't profitable yet, one of its pro's is that the free cash flow consistently stays on the plus side and makes up 19% of Okta's revenue. One of the most important contracts in this business are annual contracts. Okta gained 100 customers in Q3 with $100,000+ annual contracts, totaling over 1700 customers. The number of large enterprise contracts ($500,000+) grew 50% YoY to 320. These now represent 80% of Okta's annual contract values.\n\nAs president-elect Joe Biden will take office later this week, one of the most anticipated moves is an [increase in cyber security](https://buildbackbetter.gov/press-releases/statement-by-president-elect-joe-biden-on-cybersecurity/) spending by the new administration. Putting Okta, among other big cyber security players, into an excellent playing field the coming years.\n\n**Price Target**\n\nMarch 3 is the expected Q4 earnings. Okta is in a good position to beat their ER once again.\n\n[18 Analysts](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/OKTA/analysis?p=OKTA) combined have an average price target of $262.44.17 (upside of \\~4%) with tops being at $313.\n\n**TL;DR Okta is in a great position within the Identity and Access Management market which makes the company one of the ideal high-growth stocks moving forward. Personally, I think it is worth taking a look at and most likely a stock that will pay off not only when Q4 Earnings are reported, but easily for the next 2 years at least.**",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. Happy New Year! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week, month and year ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 4th, 2021.\n\n# **Politics will be front and center as a catalyst in the first week of the new year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/31/politics-will-be-front-and-center-as-a-catalyst-in-the-first-week-of-the-new-year-.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks exit 2020 with strong gains and are riding a tailwind, but already in the dawn of the new year, the market could face its first big challenge.\n*****\n&gt; The final outcome of the 2020 election plays out Tuesday, when voters in Georgia will pick their senators and decide which party controls the U.S. Senate.\n*****\n&gt; With President-elect Joe Biden heading to the White House and a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, Wall Street has been comfortable with the view that Biden and the Democrats could not succeed with tax hikes and more progressive policy changes while Republicans hold the Senate.\n*****\n&gt; The runoff election for the two Senate seats Tuesday is widely expected to result in one or both of the incumbent Republican senators retaining their seats. But Democrats are close in the polls and should they win, each party would have 50 seats with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the tie breaker.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cGeorgia is the most important thing to the Biden presidency for the next two years,\u201d said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. \u201cIt\u2019s going to determine what is the legislative agenda and who can get confirmed by the United States Senate.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Sen. David Perdue is being challenged by Democrat Jon Ossoff, while GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler is running against Democrat Raphael Warnock. None of the candidates had more than 50% of the vote in the Nov. 3 election, so Georgia law requires a runoff election between the two leading candidates for each seat.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s a binary event,\u201d said Mills, adding it\u2019s of growing interest to markets. \u201cThe general sense for the market is that Republicans are well positioned to maintain their majority in the Senate. But I think the 2020 election as well as the 2016 election and to some extent, the 2018 election has humbled us \u2026 The Senate outcomes, in particular, seem to be less predictable than almost any other elections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Mills said the results may take several days to determine, adding to the uncertainty the event could hold for markets. According to an RBC investor survey, 88% expect Republicans to maintain control, and most say that is a positive for the stock market.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market tends to shoot first and ask questions later. There will certainly be a reaction if Democrats win both those seats,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. Strategists say there could be a relief rally if Republican incumbents see a clear victory.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat totally dominates [trading] because it\u2019s about do we have status quo or do we have Democrats controlling all parts of Washington and what that means for spending and taxes,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI think you could see the worries about taxes overwhelming any thoughts on the benefits of more spending\u201d by Democrats.\n*****\n&gt; # By the numbers\n&gt; A year of extreme volatility ended with a big win for stocks, as the pandemic steered the course for markets. The S&amp;P 500 was up 16.3% for the year, ending at 3,756. That gain comes after a 34% decline early in the year, followed by a powerful more-than 65% rebound. Technology was the big winner for the year, and the Nasdaq was up 43.6% at 12,888.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the runoff vote, the market will be watching a stream of data in the coming week, including the important December jobs report Friday. That could show fewer than 100,000 jobs were added as the spreading virus impacted hiring and layoffs. There were 245,000 jobs created in November.\n*****\n&gt; There is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday, and a number of Fed speakers, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; The virus itself could also be a factor for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; Conventional wisdom for the coming year has been that vaccines will be widely distributed, and by the second half things will start to get back to normal and the economy will pick up. But the initial distribution has been slow, and far short of the 20 million targeted for December by President Donald Trump\u2019s task force.\n*****\n&gt; In that recent RBC survey, three quarters of investors were optimistic about vaccine distribution with 80% expecting a majority to be vaccinated by the end of 2021. \u201cWe suspect that the positive outlook for the stock market and the economy would deteriorate if expectations for a smooth vaccine rollout are not met,\u201d RBC strategists wrote.\n*****\n&gt; They also noted that nearly 60% of the investors surveyed believe high stock market valuations are problematic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis suggests to us that any threat to the economic and earnings recovery story could spark profit-taking. On this point, it is worth noting that the vaccine was the No. 1 issue keeping investors up at night, closely followed by monetary policy and excessive optimism on the recovery,\u201d the strategists noted.\n*****\n&gt; Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, said investors will also be watching the formal acceptance of the Electoral College vote Wednesday. Strategists expect the vote count to confirm Biden\u2019s presidency.\n*****\n&gt; However, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley says he will challenge the certification, and several House Republicans have already vowed to contest the election at that time. If one House member and a senator jointly object to a state\u2019s slate of electors, the two houses of Congress must separately debate and vote on the objection.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists see little chance of any impact on the election outcome, but there could be fireworks. Trump has been claiming since the election that there was fraud but multiple courts failed to find any truth to the claims.\n*****\n&gt; Rupkey said investors are not taking into account enough potential for political risk from the deep animosity between the two political parties.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the additional stimulus and hopes for additional stimulus, and infrastructure spending in 2021, I don\u2019t know that that is such a slam dunk, because of the issue of political instability,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/cAXzkxf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/HnhSggu.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/5egoYkS.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/UlNY0Um.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/z4wSKuc.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/32Ma7rG.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mRJqU8A.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/J7B4Njx.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5udYrpD.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JJmAiwp.png))**\n\n# **Thursday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1ARzFfu.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Why A Year-End Rally Bodes Well For 2021\n\n&gt; Welcome to the last day of 2020! It has been a devastating year in so many ways, yet for investors it has been quite rewarding. Much of the gains in 2020 have taken place the final two months, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up more than 14% in November and December so far, the best end to a year since WWII.\n\n&gt; A big end of year rally could have bulls smiling in 2021. \u201cTurns out a 10% or more gain the final two months of the year has equaled a higher S&amp;P 500 the following year every single time since World War II,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIn fact, January was also higher every single time as well, so maybe this strong rally to end the year is a clue for higher prices into next year.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 gained an average of more than 18% the year following a 10% or more surge during the final two months of the year. Meanwhile, January was up 5 for 5 as well, rising an impressive 3% on average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s what the average year looks like after the prior year gains 10% or more the final two months compared to a typical year. Once again, strong returns are the playbook historically.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog-12.31.20-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We wish everyone a happy and safe New Years Eve and we\u2019ll see you in 2021!\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Fifty to Zero in 283 Days\n\n&gt; In a year with some pretty crazy charts, the one below is right up there with some of the best. After all the markets have been through this year, bot the S&amp;P 500 and Long-Term Treasuries have seen nearly identical returns on a total return basis. That's right, with just a few hours left in the trading year, the S&amp;P 500's total return in 2020 has been a gain of 17.6%, while Long Term US Treasuries, as measured by the B of A Merrill Lynch Long-Term Treasury Index has rallied 17.3%. What makes this nearly identical performance all the more incredible is that on March 23rd, the performance gap between the two was more than 50 percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds.png))**\n\n&gt; The fact that stocks and bonds have essentially seen identical returns this year isn't typical. The chart below shows the annual performance spread between the S&amp;P 500 and long-term US Treasuries going back to 1978. During that time, the S&amp;P 500 has historically outperformed long-term US Treasuries by an average of 3.9 percentage points per year, but the average gap in performance between the two has been over 15 percentage points. In the 43 years since 1978, there have only been seven other years where the performance spread between the two asset classes was less than five percentage points and just two years (1985 and 1992) where the performance spread was less than a percentage point.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds-Annual-Spreads.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Back-to-Back Big Years for Technology\n\n&gt; With just two trading days (including today) left in 2020, the S&amp;P 500 Technology sector is on pace for its second year in a row of rallying more than 40%. Going back to 1990, the only time the Technology sector experienced back-to-back returns of more than 40% was in 1998 and 1999. Back then, not only was the Technology sector up 40%+ in back-to-back years, but it was also up over 75% in both of those years. If you think markets are pretty crazy these days, they still have nothing on the last two years of the 1990s!\n\n&gt; In terms of cumulative returns, the Technology sector is up 210% since the last trading day of 2018, whereas in 1999 it was up 317% in a two-year span. What's also interesting to note about the last 31 years of returns for the Technology sector is how it has only experienced five down years, while the S&amp;P 500 has been down in ten different years during that span. Furthermore, since 2009 there has only been one down year and the decline was a paltry 1.6%. Not a bad 12-year run!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Performance.png))**\n\n&gt; Given that the sector has more than doubled in the last two years, there have been some big individual winners. Topping the list with a gain of just under 400% is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). On the last day of 2018, AMD traded hands for under $20 per share. Today's it's over $90. AMD has a lead of more than 100 percentage points over the next closest stock - NVIDIA (NVDA) - which is up 288%. Interestingly, there aren't a lot of major outliers to the upside compared to the sector's 210% gain, but that's because Apple (AAPL), the sector's largest stock, has paced the sector's gains by rallying more than 240%.\n\n&gt; On the downside, just four stocks in the Technology sector have declined in the last two years. The worst of these has been DXC Technology (DXC) which has lost more than half of its value, while Juniper (JNPR) and HP Enterprise (HPE) are down between 10% and 20%. Lastly, FLIR Systems (FLIR) has declined less than 2%, so depending on how it acts in the next two days, it could move into positive territory just as Intel (INTC) did yesterday after Third Point bailed it out and moved the stock barely into positive territory for the last two years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Growth Dragging on Small Caps\n\n&gt; In the past couple of weeks, we have frequently been keeping tabs on small-cap equities which have been particularly strong performers of late resulting in very overbought readings as well as extended valuations. More specifically, taking a look at growth-oriented small-caps, with only a couple days left in the year small-cap growth stocks\u2014proxied by the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO)\u2014are on pace to have outperformed large-cap equivalents in 2020. On December 10th, IWO surpassed the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) in terms of YTD performance, and even after pulling back in the past week, IWO is still in the lead.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large1.png))**\n\n&gt; As a result of recent moves, there has been a sharp reversal on a relative basis between the two ETFs in the past week. In the chart below, we show the ratio of the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) versus the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). This ratio took off beginning in the early fall meaning small-cap growth drastically outperformed large-cap growth. But the former's weakness in the past several days has put a halt to that move.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large2.png))**\n\n&gt; As to just how sharp of a reversal this was, in the five days through yesterday's close, the decline in the ratio of IWO to IVW was the largest since June. Before that, April and March saw declines that were even larger. Not only was this one of the biggest drops in the relative performance of small-cap growth to large-cap growth in the past few months, but that also stands in the bottom 0.5% of all readings going back to 2000 when the ETF first began trading. Outside of this past spring, the only other periods that have also experienced this type of underperformance of small-cap growth relative to large-cap growth was at various points in 2011, 2008, and a handful of times in the early 2000s.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large3.png))**\n\n&gt; Small-cap underperformance has not necessarily been broad though. For value stocks, small caps (IWN) have generally outperformed large caps (IVE) for the entirety of the new bull market. While there was a bit of a turn lower in recent days, it has been nowhere close to as dramatic of a move as growth stocks.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large4.png))**\n\n&gt; In the charts below, we show average performance over the past week of Russell 2000 stocks broken into deciles based on their price to sales and price to book ratios. As shown, the most aggressively valued deciles have averaged the worst performance in the past week. Stocks with low P/S and P/B ratios have not been immune from the weakness, but they have held up significantly better.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-RTY-Decile.png))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/5udYrpD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/hQIRBYI.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.4.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.4.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  1.5.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZAbC0jw.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.5.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wKzyMxp.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.6.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BUFtffd.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.6.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cDQHHqx.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.7.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NhUT413.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.7.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7p03h4M.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.8.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.8.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Micron Technology, Inc. $75.18\n**Micron Technology, Inc.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week, month and year ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 4th, 2021.\n\n# **Politics will be front and center as a catalyst in the first week of the new year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/31/politics-will-be-front-and-center-as-a-catalyst-in-the-first-week-of-the-new-year-.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks exit 2020 with strong gains and are riding a tailwind, but already in the dawn of the new year, the market could face its first big challenge.\n*****\n&gt; The final outcome of the 2020 election plays out Tuesday, when voters in Georgia will pick their senators and decide which party controls the U.S. Senate.\n*****\n&gt; With President-elect Joe Biden heading to the White House and a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, Wall Street has been comfortable with the view that Biden and the Democrats could not succeed with tax hikes and more progressive policy changes while Republicans hold the Senate.\n*****\n&gt; The runoff election for the two Senate seats Tuesday is widely expected to result in one or both of the incumbent Republican senators retaining their seats. But Democrats are close in the polls and should they win, each party would have 50 seats with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the tie breaker.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cGeorgia is the most important thing to the Biden presidency for the next two years,\u201d said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. \u201cIt\u2019s going to determine what is the legislative agenda and who can get confirmed by the United States Senate.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Sen. David Perdue is being challenged by Democrat Jon Ossoff, while GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler is running against Democrat Raphael Warnock. None of the candidates had more than 50% of the vote in the Nov. 3 election, so Georgia law requires a runoff election between the two leading candidates for each seat.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s a binary event,\u201d said Mills, adding it\u2019s of growing interest to markets. \u201cThe general sense for the market is that Republicans are well positioned to maintain their majority in the Senate. But I think the 2020 election as well as the 2016 election and to some extent, the 2018 election has humbled us \u2026 The Senate outcomes, in particular, seem to be less predictable than almost any other elections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Mills said the results may take several days to determine, adding to the uncertainty the event could hold for markets. According to an RBC investor survey, 88% expect Republicans to maintain control, and most say that is a positive for the stock market.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market tends to shoot first and ask questions later. There will certainly be a reaction if Democrats win both those seats,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. Strategists say there could be a relief rally if Republican incumbents see a clear victory.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat totally dominates [trading] because it\u2019s about do we have status quo or do we have Democrats controlling all parts of Washington and what that means for spending and taxes,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI think you could see the worries about taxes overwhelming any thoughts on the benefits of more spending\u201d by Democrats.\n*****\n&gt; # By the numbers\n&gt; A year of extreme volatility ended with a big win for stocks, as the pandemic steered the course for markets. The S&amp;P 500 was up 16.3% for the year, ending at 3,756. That gain comes after a 34% decline early in the year, followed by a powerful more-than 65% rebound. Technology was the big winner for the year, and the Nasdaq was up 43.6% at 12,888.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the runoff vote, the market will be watching a stream of data in the coming week, including the important December jobs report Friday. That could show fewer than 100,000 jobs were added as the spreading virus impacted hiring and layoffs. There were 245,000 jobs created in November.\n*****\n&gt; There is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday, and a number of Fed speakers, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; The virus itself could also be a factor for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; Conventional wisdom for the coming year has been that vaccines will be widely distributed, and by the second half things will start to get back to normal and the economy will pick up. But the initial distribution has been slow, and far short of the 20 million targeted for December by President Donald Trump\u2019s task force.\n*****\n&gt; In that recent RBC survey, three quarters of investors were optimistic about vaccine distribution with 80% expecting a majority to be vaccinated by the end of 2021. \u201cWe suspect that the positive outlook for the stock market and the economy would deteriorate if expectations for a smooth vaccine rollout are not met,\u201d RBC strategists wrote.\n*****\n&gt; They also noted that nearly 60% of the investors surveyed believe high stock market valuations are problematic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis suggests to us that any threat to the economic and earnings recovery story could spark profit-taking. On this point, it is worth noting that the vaccine was the No. 1 issue keeping investors up at night, closely followed by monetary policy and excessive optimism on the recovery,\u201d the strategists noted.\n*****\n&gt; Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, said investors will also be watching the formal acceptance of the Electoral College vote Wednesday. Strategists expect the vote count to confirm Biden\u2019s presidency.\n*****\n&gt; However, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley says he will challenge the certification, and several House Republicans have already vowed to contest the election at that time. If one House member and a senator jointly object to a state\u2019s slate of electors, the two houses of Congress must separately debate and vote on the objection.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists see little chance of any impact on the election outcome, but there could be fireworks. Trump has been claiming since the election that there was fraud but multiple courts failed to find any truth to the claims.\n*****\n&gt; Rupkey said investors are not taking into account enough potential for political risk from the deep animosity between the two political parties.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the additional stimulus and hopes for additional stimulus, and infrastructure spending in 2021, I don\u2019t know that that is such a slam dunk, because of the issue of political instability,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/cAXzkxf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/HnhSggu.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/5egoYkS.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/UlNY0Um.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/z4wSKuc.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/32Ma7rG.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mRJqU8A.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/J7B4Njx.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5udYrpD.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JJmAiwp.png))**\n\n# **Thursday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1ARzFfu.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Why A Year-End Rally Bodes Well For 2021\n\n&gt; Welcome to the last day of 2020! It has been a devastating year in so many ways, yet for investors it has been quite rewarding. Much of the gains in 2020 have taken place the final two months, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up more than 14% in November and December so far, the best end to a year since WWII.\n\n&gt; A big end of year rally could have bulls smiling in 2021. \u201cTurns out a 10% or more gain the final two months of the year has equaled a higher S&amp;P 500 the following year every single time since World War II,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIn fact, January was also higher every single time as well, so maybe this strong rally to end the year is a clue for higher prices into next year.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 gained an average of more than 18% the year following a 10% or more surge during the final two months of the year. Meanwhile, January was up 5 for 5 as well, rising an impressive 3% on average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s what the average year looks like after the prior year gains 10% or more the final two months compared to a typical year. Once again, strong returns are the playbook historically.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog-12.31.20-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We wish everyone a happy and safe New Years Eve and we\u2019ll see you in 2021!\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Fifty to Zero in 283 Days\n\n&gt; In a year with some pretty crazy charts, the one below is right up there with some of the best. After all the markets have been through this year, bot the S&amp;P 500 and Long-Term Treasuries have seen nearly identical returns on a total return basis. That's right, with just a few hours left in the trading year, the S&amp;P 500's total return in 2020 has been a gain of 17.6%, while Long Term US Treasuries, as measured by the B of A Merrill Lynch Long-Term Treasury Index has rallied 17.3%. What makes this nearly identical performance all the more incredible is that on March 23rd, the performance gap between the two was more than 50 percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds.png))**\n\n&gt; The fact that stocks and bonds have essentially seen identical returns this year isn't typical. The chart below shows the annual performance spread between the S&amp;P 500 and long-term US Treasuries going back to 1978. During that time, the S&amp;P 500 has historically outperformed long-term US Treasuries by an average of 3.9 percentage points per year, but the average gap in performance between the two has been over 15 percentage points. In the 43 years since 1978, there have only been seven other years where the performance spread between the two asset classes was less than five percentage points and just two years (1985 and 1992) where the performance spread was less than a percentage point.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds-Annual-Spreads.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Back-to-Back Big Years for Technology\n\n&gt; With just two trading days (including today) left in 2020, the S&amp;P 500 Technology sector is on pace for its second year in a row of rallying more than 40%. Going back to 1990, the only time the Technology sector experienced back-to-back returns of more than 40% was in 1998 and 1999. Back then, not only was the Technology sector up 40%+ in back-to-back years, but it was also up over 75% in both of those years. If you think markets are pretty crazy these days, they still have nothing on the last two years of the 1990s!\n\n&gt; In terms of cumulative returns, the Technology sector is up 210% since the last trading day of 2018, whereas in 1999 it was up 317% in a two-year span. What's also interesting to note about the last 31 years of returns for the Technology sector is how it has only experienced five down years, while the S&amp;P 500 has been down in ten different years during that span. Furthermore, since 2009 there has only been one down year and the decline was a paltry 1.6%. Not a bad 12-year run!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Performance.png))**\n\n&gt; Given that the sector has more than doubled in the last two years, there have been some big individual winners. Topping the list with a gain of just under 400% is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). On the last day of 2018, AMD traded hands for under $20 per share. Today's it's over $90. AMD has a lead of more than 100 percentage points over the next closest stock - NVIDIA (NVDA) - which is up 288%. Interestingly, there aren't a lot of major outliers to the upside compared to the sector's 210% gain, but that's because Apple (AAPL), the sector's largest stock, has paced the sector's gains by rallying more than 240%.\n\n&gt; On the downside, just four stocks in the Technology sector have declined in the last two years. The worst of these has been DXC Technology (DXC) which has lost more than half of its value, while Juniper (JNPR) and HP Enterprise (HPE) are down between 10% and 20%. Lastly, FLIR Systems (FLIR) has declined less than 2%, so depending on how it acts in the next two days, it could move into positive territory just as Intel (INTC) did yesterday after Third Point bailed it out and moved the stock barely into positive territory for the last two years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Growth Dragging on Small Caps\n\n&gt; In the past couple of weeks, we have frequently been keeping tabs on small-cap equities which have been particularly strong performers of late resulting in very overbought readings as well as extended valuations. More specifically, taking a look at growth-oriented small-caps, with only a couple days left in the year small-cap growth stocks\u2014proxied by the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO)\u2014are on pace to have outperformed large-cap equivalents in 2020. On December 10th, IWO surpassed the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) in terms of YTD performance, and even after pulling back in the past week, IWO is still in the lead.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large1.png))**\n\n&gt; As a result of recent moves, there has been a sharp reversal on a relative basis between the two ETFs in the past week. In the chart below, we show the ratio of the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) versus the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). This ratio took off beginning in the early fall meaning small-cap growth drastically outperformed large-cap growth. But the former's weakness in the past several days has put a halt to that move.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large2.png))**\n\n&gt; As to just how sharp of a reversal this was, in the five days through yesterday's close, the decline in the ratio of IWO to IVW was the largest since June. Before that, April and March saw declines that were even larger. Not only was this one of the biggest drops in the relative performance of small-cap growth to large-cap growth in the past few months, but that also stands in the bottom 0.5% of all readings going back to 2000 when the ETF first began trading. Outside of this past spring, the only other periods that have also experienced this type of underperformance of small-cap growth relative to large-cap growth was at various points in 2011, 2008, and a handful of times in the early 2000s.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large3.png))**\n\n&gt; Small-cap underperformance has not necessarily been broad though. For value stocks, small caps (IWN) have generally outperformed large caps (IVE) for the entirety of the new bull market. While there was a bit of a turn lower in recent days, it has been nowhere close to as dramatic of a move as growth stocks.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large4.png))**\n\n&gt; In the charts below, we show average performance over the past week of Russell 2000 stocks broken into deciles based on their price to sales and price to book ratios. As shown, the most aggressively valued deciles have averaged the worst performance in the past week. Stocks with low P/S and P/B ratios have not been immune from the weakness, but they have held up significantly better.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-RTY-Decile.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending December 31st, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFRABTKrDl8))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.3.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prYPiK171zk))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$MU** \n&gt; * **$BBBY** \n&gt; * **$SMPL** \n&gt; * **$WBA** \n&gt; * **$STZ** \n&gt; * **$RPM** \n&gt; * **$MSM** \n&gt; * **$CAG** \n&gt; * **$UNF** \n&gt; * **$HELE** \n&gt; * **$ANGO** \n&gt; * **$SGH** \n&gt; * **$AYI** \n&gt; * **$REVG** \n&gt; * **$LW** \n&gt; * **$WDFC** \n&gt; * **$LNN** \n&gt; * **$LNDC** \n&gt; * **$SAR** \n&gt; * **$RGP** \n&gt; * **$GBX** \n&gt; * **$ACCD** \n&gt; * **$DCT** \n&gt; * **$FC** \n&gt; * **$NTIC** \n&gt; * **$SCHN**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/5udYrpD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/hQIRBYI.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.4.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.4.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  1.5.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZAbC0jw.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.5.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wKzyMxp.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.6.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BUFtffd.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.6.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cDQHHqx.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.7.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NhUT413.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.7.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7p03h4M.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.8.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.8.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Micron Technology, Inc. $75.18\n**Micron Technology, Inc.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week, month and year ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 4th, 2021.\n\n# **Politics will be front and center as a catalyst in the first week of the new year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/31/politics-will-be-front-and-center-as-a-catalyst-in-the-first-week-of-the-new-year-.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks exit 2020 with strong gains and are riding a tailwind, but already in the dawn of the new year, the market could face its first big challenge.\n*****\n&gt; The final outcome of the 2020 election plays out Tuesday, when voters in Georgia will pick their senators and decide which party controls the U.S. Senate.\n*****\n&gt; With President-elect Joe Biden heading to the White House and a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, Wall Street has been comfortable with the view that Biden and the Democrats could not succeed with tax hikes and more progressive policy changes while Republicans hold the Senate.\n*****\n&gt; The runoff election for the two Senate seats Tuesday is widely expected to result in one or both of the incumbent Republican senators retaining their seats. But Democrats are close in the polls and should they win, each party would have 50 seats with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the tie breaker.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cGeorgia is the most important thing to the Biden presidency for the next two years,\u201d said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. \u201cIt\u2019s going to determine what is the legislative agenda and who can get confirmed by the United States Senate.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Sen. David Perdue is being challenged by Democrat Jon Ossoff, while GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler is running against Democrat Raphael Warnock. None of the candidates had more than 50% of the vote in the Nov. 3 election, so Georgia law requires a runoff election between the two leading candidates for each seat.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s a binary event,\u201d said Mills, adding it\u2019s of growing interest to markets. \u201cThe general sense for the market is that Republicans are well positioned to maintain their majority in the Senate. But I think the 2020 election as well as the 2016 election and to some extent, the 2018 election has humbled us \u2026 The Senate outcomes, in particular, seem to be less predictable than almost any other elections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Mills said the results may take several days to determine, adding to the uncertainty the event could hold for markets. According to an RBC investor survey, 88% expect Republicans to maintain control, and most say that is a positive for the stock market.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market tends to shoot first and ask questions later. There will certainly be a reaction if Democrats win both those seats,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. Strategists say there could be a relief rally if Republican incumbents see a clear victory.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat totally dominates [trading] because it\u2019s about do we have status quo or do we have Democrats controlling all parts of Washington and what that means for spending and taxes,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI think you could see the worries about taxes overwhelming any thoughts on the benefits of more spending\u201d by Democrats.\n*****\n&gt; # By the numbers\n&gt; A year of extreme volatility ended with a big win for stocks, as the pandemic steered the course for markets. The S&amp;P 500 was up 16.3% for the year, ending at 3,756. That gain comes after a 34% decline early in the year, followed by a powerful more-than 65% rebound. Technology was the big winner for the year, and the Nasdaq was up 43.6% at 12,888.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the runoff vote, the market will be watching a stream of data in the coming week, including the important December jobs report Friday. That could show fewer than 100,000 jobs were added as the spreading virus impacted hiring and layoffs. There were 245,000 jobs created in November.\n*****\n&gt; There is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday, and a number of Fed speakers, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; The virus itself could also be a factor for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; Conventional wisdom for the coming year has been that vaccines will be widely distributed, and by the second half things will start to get back to normal and the economy will pick up. But the initial distribution has been slow, and far short of the 20 million targeted for December by President Donald Trump\u2019s task force.\n*****\n&gt; In that recent RBC survey, three quarters of investors were optimistic about vaccine distribution with 80% expecting a majority to be vaccinated by the end of 2021. \u201cWe suspect that the positive outlook for the stock market and the economy would deteriorate if expectations for a smooth vaccine rollout are not met,\u201d RBC strategists wrote.\n*****\n&gt; They also noted that nearly 60% of the investors surveyed believe high stock market valuations are problematic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis suggests to us that any threat to the economic and earnings recovery story could spark profit-taking. On this point, it is worth noting that the vaccine was the No. 1 issue keeping investors up at night, closely followed by monetary policy and excessive optimism on the recovery,\u201d the strategists noted.\n*****\n&gt; Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, said investors will also be watching the formal acceptance of the Electoral College vote Wednesday. Strategists expect the vote count to confirm Biden\u2019s presidency.\n*****\n&gt; However, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley says he will challenge the certification, and several House Republicans have already vowed to contest the election at that time. If one House member and a senator jointly object to a state\u2019s slate of electors, the two houses of Congress must separately debate and vote on the objection.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists see little chance of any impact on the election outcome, but there could be fireworks. Trump has been claiming since the election that there was fraud but multiple courts failed to find any truth to the claims.\n*****\n&gt; Rupkey said investors are not taking into account enough potential for political risk from the deep animosity between the two political parties.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the additional stimulus and hopes for additional stimulus, and infrastructure spending in 2021, I don\u2019t know that that is such a slam dunk, because of the issue of political instability,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/cAXzkxf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/HnhSggu.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/5egoYkS.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/UlNY0Um.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/z4wSKuc.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/32Ma7rG.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mRJqU8A.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/J7B4Njx.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5udYrpD.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JJmAiwp.png))**\n\n# **Thursday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1ARzFfu.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Why A Year-End Rally Bodes Well For 2021\n\n&gt; Welcome to the last day of 2020! It has been a devastating year in so many ways, yet for investors it has been quite rewarding. Much of the gains in 2020 have taken place the final two months, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up more than 14% in November and December so far, the best end to a year since WWII.\n\n&gt; A big end of year rally could have bulls smiling in 2021. \u201cTurns out a 10% or more gain the final two months of the year has equaled a higher S&amp;P 500 the following year every single time since World War II,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIn fact, January was also higher every single time as well, so maybe this strong rally to end the year is a clue for higher prices into next year.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 gained an average of more than 18% the year following a 10% or more surge during the final two months of the year. Meanwhile, January was up 5 for 5 as well, rising an impressive 3% on average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s what the average year looks like after the prior year gains 10% or more the final two months compared to a typical year. Once again, strong returns are the playbook historically.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog-12.31.20-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We wish everyone a happy and safe New Years Eve and we\u2019ll see you in 2021!\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Fifty to Zero in 283 Days\n\n&gt; In a year with some pretty crazy charts, the one below is right up there with some of the best. After all the markets have been through this year, bot the S&amp;P 500 and Long-Term Treasuries have seen nearly identical returns on a total return basis. That's right, with just a few hours left in the trading year, the S&amp;P 500's total return in 2020 has been a gain of 17.6%, while Long Term US Treasuries, as measured by the B of A Merrill Lynch Long-Term Treasury Index has rallied 17.3%. What makes this nearly identical performance all the more incredible is that on March 23rd, the performance gap between the two was more than 50 percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds.png))**\n\n&gt; The fact that stocks and bonds have essentially seen identical returns this year isn't typical. The chart below shows the annual performance spread between the S&amp;P 500 and long-term US Treasuries going back to 1978. During that time, the S&amp;P 500 has historically outperformed long-term US Treasuries by an average of 3.9 percentage points per year, but the average gap in performance between the two has been over 15 percentage points. In the 43 years since 1978, there have only been seven other years where the performance spread between the two asset classes was less than five percentage points and just two years (1985 and 1992) where the performance spread was less than a percentage point.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds-Annual-Spreads.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Back-to-Back Big Years for Technology\n\n&gt; With just two trading days (including today) left in 2020, the S&amp;P 500 Technology sector is on pace for its second year in a row of rallying more than 40%. Going back to 1990, the only time the Technology sector experienced back-to-back returns of more than 40% was in 1998 and 1999. Back then, not only was the Technology sector up 40%+ in back-to-back years, but it was also up over 75% in both of those years. If you think markets are pretty crazy these days, they still have nothing on the last two years of the 1990s!\n\n&gt; In terms of cumulative returns, the Technology sector is up 210% since the last trading day of 2018, whereas in 1999 it was up 317% in a two-year span. What's also interesting to note about the last 31 years of returns for the Technology sector is how it has only experienced five down years, while the S&amp;P 500 has been down in ten different years during that span. Furthermore, since 2009 there has only been one down year and the decline was a paltry 1.6%. Not a bad 12-year run!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Performance.png))**\n\n&gt; Given that the sector has more than doubled in the last two years, there have been some big individual winners. Topping the list with a gain of just under 400% is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). On the last day of 2018, AMD traded hands for under $20 per share. Today's it's over $90. AMD has a lead of more than 100 percentage points over the next closest stock - NVIDIA (NVDA) - which is up 288%. Interestingly, there aren't a lot of major outliers to the upside compared to the sector's 210% gain, but that's because Apple (AAPL), the sector's largest stock, has paced the sector's gains by rallying more than 240%.\n\n&gt; On the downside, just four stocks in the Technology sector have declined in the last two years. The worst of these has been DXC Technology (DXC) which has lost more than half of its value, while Juniper (JNPR) and HP Enterprise (HPE) are down between 10% and 20%. Lastly, FLIR Systems (FLIR) has declined less than 2%, so depending on how it acts in the next two days, it could move into positive territory just as Intel (INTC) did yesterday after Third Point bailed it out and moved the stock barely into positive territory for the last two years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Growth Dragging on Small Caps\n\n&gt; In the past couple of weeks, we have frequently been keeping tabs on small-cap equities which have been particularly strong performers of late resulting in very overbought readings as well as extended valuations. More specifically, taking a look at growth-oriented small-caps, with only a couple days left in the year small-cap growth stocks\u2014proxied by the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO)\u2014are on pace to have outperformed large-cap equivalents in 2020. On December 10th, IWO surpassed the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) in terms of YTD performance, and even after pulling back in the past week, IWO is still in the lead.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large1.png))**\n\n&gt; As a result of recent moves, there has been a sharp reversal on a relative basis between the two ETFs in the past week. In the chart below, we show the ratio of the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) versus the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). This ratio took off beginning in the early fall meaning small-cap growth drastically outperformed large-cap growth. But the former's weakness in the past several days has put a halt to that move.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large2.png))**\n\n&gt; As to just how sharp of a reversal this was, in the five days through yesterday's close, the decline in the ratio of IWO to IVW was the largest since June. Before that, April and March saw declines that were even larger. Not only was this one of the biggest drops in the relative performance of small-cap growth to large-cap growth in the past few months, but that also stands in the bottom 0.5% of all readings going back to 2000 when the ETF first began trading. Outside of this past spring, the only other periods that have also experienced this type of underperformance of small-cap growth relative to large-cap growth was at various points in 2011, 2008, and a handful of times in the early 2000s.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large3.png))**\n\n&gt; Small-cap underperformance has not necessarily been broad though. For value stocks, small caps (IWN) have generally outperformed large caps (IVE) for the entirety of the new bull market. While there was a bit of a turn lower in recent days, it has been nowhere close to as dramatic of a move as growth stocks.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large4.png))**\n\n&gt; In the charts below, we show average performance over the past week of Russell 2000 stocks broken into deciles based on their price to sales and price to book ratios. As shown, the most aggressively valued deciles have averaged the worst performance in the past week. Stocks with low P/S and P/B ratios have not been immune from the weakness, but they have held up significantly better.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-RTY-Decile.png))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/5udYrpD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/hQIRBYI.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.4.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.4.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  1.5.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZAbC0jw.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.5.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wKzyMxp.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.6.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BUFtffd.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.6.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cDQHHqx.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.7.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NhUT413.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.7.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7p03h4M.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.8.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.8.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Micron Technology, Inc. $75.18\n**Micron Technology, Inc.

The tool is inclusive of almost 1,000 tickers now.\n\n**What is this tool good for**\n\nI posted in ThetaGang the list with HIGH IV options which is great for running the wheel or selling options. This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher. Do your DD before entering any positions!\n\n# Low IV Tickers List\n\n\\*Some of the market cap data is off, so always double check before entering any plays!\n\nPlease note this list is only inclusive of the more popular tickers mentioned around Reddit.

        "selftext": "DoorDash is currently sitting at $142 per share, down 22% from $182 when retail investors were able to buy at IPO. Only \\~10% of its 286M outstanding shares are available to trade due to its lockup period, giving it a float of 20M shares.\n\nHere's where things get interesting. If you take a look at page 91 of their S-1 filing ([Go to page 91 to confirm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000119312520292381/d752207ds1.htm#rom752207_9) ), existing shareholders PRE-IPO purchased 284M shares at $8.73. Company employees who purchased shares at that price are salivating at a current 1,628% profit. Early lockup period expires 90 days after IPO, meaning that 90% of outstanding shares (284M shares once again) that currently can't be traded and were purchased at $8.73 will be released into the market available to trade. Regardless of what you think about valuation and possible future growth of DoorDash (which is already ridiculously overpriced and they had the worst IPO in history), any rational employee will dump their holdings immediately for that 10 bagger profit.\n\nNow considering present conditions, the price action is ridiculous. Looking at the level 2 data, there is almost no retail volume, and any trades made throughout the day are by MMs trying to keep this stock liquid. Volume from the past 2 days has already dropped by 50%. Literally NO ONE wants to buy this POS. The price is pinned at $140, with retail dips that are immediately bought up by manipulation. If you look at the 1 minute chart yesterday, it traded at literally $140 throughout the day and suddenly spiked to 146 in a manner of 3 minutes before slowly settling down to $142. This thing is manipulated as fuck, and as soon as MMs are exhausted it will crash regardless of the aforementioned S-1 filing.\n\nI have 175 contracts of 5/21 $80 puts. I'm betting $87k I can look back at this post in 5 months and pretend I'm reenacting The Big Short as Ryan Gosling. More than likely, I'll probably have to start driving for DoorDash and moonlight sucking weens behind the restaurants I just made a delivery from.\n\nLooking for any serious counterarguments on why this play might be retarded.",

        "selftext": "**Background**\n\nCD PROJEKT S.A. (WSE: CDR) is a Polish video game developer, publisher and distributor based in Warsaw. CD Projekt Red, best known for The Witcher series and the recent release of Cyberpunk 2077.\n\nThe CD PROJEKT Group currently conducts operating activities in two key segments: CD PROJEKT RED and GOG.com (originally as Good Old Games).\n\n**Hierarchy**\n\nCD PROJEKT Capital Group is headed by CD PROJEKT S.A. A holding company which has five subsidiaries.\n\nThe subsidiaries are:\n\n\\- GOG sp. z o.o (Similar to Steam, it is a distributor of games).\n\n\\- CD PROJEKT Inc (Where all the game development happens)\n\n\\- CD PROJEKT Co. Ltd (Only for selling games in China)\n\n\\- Spokko sp. z o.o. (The mobile arm of CD projekt red)\n\n\\- CD PROJEKT RED STORE sp. z o.o. (A new store of merchandise launched by the company)\n\n**GOG -** Who have just released a 2.0 version called GOG Galaxy which subsequently entered its beta testing phase. The goal of the application is to enable players to integrate all their game shelves into a single library, to communicate with friends and to track their progress regardless of their preferred gaming platforms. Its functionality will span PC and console platforms, extending beyond the GOG.com user base. It's main selling points are that is uses the cloud, is DRM free and has a ton of old games such as Diablo, Destroy all humans etc on it's platform that Steam doesn't.\n\nSteam is the single biggest distributor of digital games for PC, it's been dominating the market for years and has way more games than GOG does due to this. Especially as a lot of publishers do not want to host their games DRM free which GOG requires. It's very difficult to predict the future of GOG because Steam is a private company so we don't have access to it's numbers.\n\nHowever the big benefit of GOG is that CD Projekt Red can sell and promote it's games directly through their own platform. The benefit being a much bigger margin on each game sold as 100% of the profit goes to CD Projekt red if a game is sold on GOG, whereas on Steam they take a 20% cut for the first $50m revenue of Cyberpunk. **One third** of all digital PC preorders for Cyberpunk 2077 sales were on GOG which is an incredible achievement by CD Projekt Red considering Steams dominance.\n\nThis is probably the reason why CD Projekt Red has such a huge operating margin from 30% to 50% in recent years. They are involved in the entire process of making and selling their games.\n\n***GWENT: The Witcher Card Game*** is the first multiplayer game developed by the CD PROJEKT Group. It has been a hugely successful and highly rated game (which is impressive considering it's their first mobile multiplayer game). The reason why this game is important for the future is because multiplayer is the key to the cash machine which is microtransactions which the card game has.\n\n**Cyberpunk** was released recently and had been in development for many years. It's sold very well but less than analysts expectations and there has been serious problems on console versions which led to sony removing cyberpunk 2077 from it's PS store for the time being. This caused the companies stock to plummet 37% recently.\n\nI'll get into the numbers at the bottom for my reverse DCF that I did.\n\n**Cyberpunk Online** multiplayer will definitely come at some point within the next couple of years. The reason being is that after GTA Onlines unbelievable success and constant revenue generation for Take Two then it makes sense to try and replicate this with Cyberpunk. This multiplayer will feature microtransactions and in my opinion is the way Cd Projekt red can really make the big $$ in the future. Microtransactions for cosmetic items like in game skins or packs (like fifa) are easy to implement and have huge operating margins as they take 0 CAPEX and virtually no time to implement due to being some simple code and designs. Here's a quote taken from their 2019 Annual Report for *Key Sources Of Revenue*:\n\n&gt;\u25a0 sales carried out through optional microtransactions in GWENT: The Witcher Card Game (incl. kegs and meteorite dust) via GOG, proprietors of console platforms (PlayStation, Xbox) and App Store (Apple)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere are some huge risks with cd projekt red, here are the main ones:\n\n\\- Neither IP, The Wither or Cyberpunk 2077 is owned by CD Projekt since the two series are based on a series of novels and a tabletop RPG respectively. So they would need permission from these license holders (the creators I think) to be able to do other spin offs for them. While it is likely the permission will be given due to the huge successes it's not a certainty.\n\n\\- CD Projekt Red relies on a couple of block busters to make 80% of their revenue and earnings. The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 are the only revenue generates the company has (apart from GOG). If CD Projekt red messes up either of these huge IP's in the future (or like they just have with the console versions of Cyberpunk) then you can expect a huge and sudden stock price drop and potential damage to the company.\n\n\\- Because of the few but huge releases, CD Projekt Red has very volatile earnings and revenue making it very hard to predict, similar to Take Two Interactive. You can see in the following picture how sales drop a lot after release.\n\n**Co-Founders and Board History**\n\nCD PROJEKT has a very long tenure of the management board, all at least 10 years and 3/5 of them 20+ years. Insiders have a significant stake in CD Projekt red's stock, including the joint CEO's. This is great news for shareholders as the insiders have a big incentive to make the company work as they have big stakes in the company.\n\nCompany shareholding structure is made up of the following people:\n\n\\- **Marcin Iwinski** (Joint CEO &amp; Co-Founder) is **13%**\n\n\\- **Michal Kicinski** (Ex Joint CEO &amp; Co-Founder) is **11%**\n\n\\- **Piotr Nielubowicz** (VP, CFO) is **6%**\n\n\\- **Adam Kicinski** (President &amp; Joint CEO) is **3%**\n\nIncentives for management:\n\n&gt;Management goals are based 80% on net earnings and 20% on SP over the WIG index.\n\nThese are poor goals in my opinion. Net earnings can be enhanced by poor acquisitions and stock price is meaningless and should be ignored in incentives as it can produce short term motivations.\n\nManagement hit the majority of their goals for year 2019.Their goals going forward:\n\n&gt;Goals for 2020-2025 Aggregate Net Income: 8,300 PLN or 1,660 PLN a year.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Optimistic goals for 2020-2025 Aggregate Net Income: 10,000 PLN or 2,000 PLN a year.\n\nThese goals seem too high in my opinion. Especially after their cyberpunk flop on consoles but it's still possible.\n\n**Competitors**\n\nCD PROJEKT is well known for its biggest sales on The Witcher and Cyberpunk 2077 hype. However, there\u2019s a lot of gaming industries that compete with one another.\n\nThus comparing its competitors such as Take-Two Interactive, Electronic Arts (EA), Activision Blizzard has more diversified games and games produced more frequently compared to CD PROJEKT RED.\n\nCD Projekt Red's risk in terms of competitors is releasing a big game that clashes with another big game such as GTA 6. However all gaming companies have a good tailwind right now due to COVID restrictions and microtransactions are lifting all gaming companies margins. A rising tide lifts all boats.\n\n**Industry**\n\n&gt;**-** CAGR 2019-2024 Video games and e-sports growth expected to be 7% (source: PWC Global Entertainment &amp; Media Outlook 2020\u20132024).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- In 2019 the strongest strong growth was observed in the mobile and console segments. The former grew by 9.7%, reaching 68.2 billion USD, while the latter grew by 7.3%, reaching 45.3billion USD. The PC market reached a volume of 35.3 billion USD, having increased by 2.8%.The largest share of the global videogame market is currently held by mobile devices (46%), 80% of which are smartphone releases. Gaming consoles come in second at 30%, followed by the PC 24%. Mobile devices are projected to retain their top position, with their corresponding market volume increasing by 11.2% annually (on average) over the next three years. According to estimates, the volume of the global mobile game market will reach 93.6 billion USD by 2022 (it currently stands at 68.2 billion USD).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can see from the above as to why CD projekt red is branching out to smartphones and China.\n\n**Reverse DCF**  \n\n\nHere's the original post and reverse DCF because r/stocks does not allow images: [https://www.reddit.com/r/UndervaluedStonks/comments/kofhq7/wsecdr\\_cd\\_projekt\\_red\\_analysis\\_is\\_it\\_undervalued/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UndervaluedStonks/comments/kofhq7/wsecdr_cd_projekt_red_analysis_is_it_undervalued/)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIt's been extremely difficult to project CD Projekt Red and even after doing research I am still very unsure on a bunch of variables. In my opinion the markets assumptions of CD Projekt Red's growth and margins as shown above in the reverse DCF is perfectly acceptable to me. Therefore I would not buy their shares unless they dipped to around 210 zloty\\~ as I don't think they are undervalued yet. given the risks.\n\nPlease comment if you see anything wrong with my valuation. This was a very difficult one for me.\n\nThanks",

That guide got a lot of positive feedback, and I suggest those who missed it take a look. [How to CONSISTENTLY Outperform the S&amp;P500 using Theta Gang Strategy. A Comprehensive Guide to Wheeling ETFs.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iz68r4/how_to_consistently_outperform_the_sp500_using/) And if you are truly retarded check out my recent Tips for Noobies. [Top 5 Tips Every Noobie Trader MUST Know.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4ztif/top_5_tips_every_noobie_trader_must_know/)\n\nI've since decided to put my skills to the test and will attempt to double a small $8000 account by the end of 2021 using similar strategies. This will mostly be an educational experience, and I will walk you through all my thought processes and my trades as I make them so hopefully the retards among you can learn a thing or two. And if I blow up the account, that will be entertaining as well, right?\n\nSome of the less experienced among you may think this is a simple feat. The more experienced among you will know achieving such consistently high returns will be an incredibly difficult feat. I put my odds of success somewhere around 20% to be honest. But it will be a good education for both of us. Really, I only need to achieve around 6% return every month to break 100% by the end of the year (after compounding), and put in those terms the task doesn't sound so daunting, does it?\n\nStill, I will be forced to make some very aggressive, downright risky plays in order to make this remotely possible. If my wheeling ETF guide was about a safe, conservative strategy, this guide will be the opposite. Keep that in mind if you are foolish enough to copy my trades. \n\nWish me luck... I will need it.\n\n# Basic Strategy\n\nI will not leave any tool off the table here. If I see an opportunity, I will take it. But for the majority of my trades I will be using a very simple strategy. Find high implied volatility stonks and sell options on them. I will typically be selling cash-secured puts since naked calls carry excess risk, which means I want to look for stocks I am generally bullish on long-term.\n\nUsing ToS I've set up some very basic filters to scan for promising stocks to trade:\n\n**1) Option Implied Volatility &gt;80% (for tendies)**\n\n**2) Stock Volume &gt;5,000,000 (for liquidity)**\n\n**3) Market Cap &gt;$1B (to comply with WSB rules)**\n\n**4) Stock Price &lt;$82 (collateral maximum)**\n\nScanning with these filters brings up a lot of familiar names: GME, PLTR, QS, NKLA, LAZR, FCEL, UVXY, ACB, XPEV, SPCE, and so on. In other words, the type of stonks retards like you are buying expensive options on...\n\n# Running the Numbers\n\nI will try to not get too technical and into the weeds with this experiment. I'll be using some very basic math to decide which options to sell. I highly recommend you play around with the numbers on options to really get an intuitive feel for how they work. For example, if I were to ask you what happens to the relative cost of premium ($/day) as DTE increases on an option, what would be your answer? If you don't know, just run some simple numbers to find out...\n\nSPY premium / DTE = $/day\n\n332 / 5 = 66.4\n\n440 / 10 = 44\n\n652 / 21 = 31\n\n1915 / 140 = 13.7\n\nAs you can see, premium cost per day decreases as time till expiration increases. (It's more complicated than that of course, but we are keeping it simple here). For that reason I will be doing something I generally don't advocate: Selling weeklies to squeeze a bit of extra juice out of my options. This also means I will be holding them all to expiration to deal with issues like higher gamma.\n\nHere is another simple equation I can use to give me a lot of information:\n\n**(Premium \\* 365) / (DTE \\* Strike) = Max ROI**\n\nBasically what I'm doing is estimating the returns from selling the same option for an entire year with a 100% success rate. Since I'm aiming for 100% ROI, any options I sell will need to be over 100 in this formula. Of course, I won't have a 100% success rate on my trades, so I should probably aim even higher to give myself some buffer, maybe around 120. Let's try it on some \\~ATM options to get a relative comparison of option value:\n\nSPY: 12.2\n\nPSTH: 48.1\n\nGME: 140.5\n\nPLTR: 111.1\n\nQS: 263.7\n\nUVXY: 134.2\n\nDon't put too much stock in these numbers. I'm just using them as a simple comparative tool for judging the profitability of different options.\n\nWe can glean even more information from the above number if we multiply it by the Prob. ITM% of course, to get something closer to an \"Expected Value\" for an option, which I will perhaps go into more detail on next month.\n\nFinally I'll be throwing around various other calculations as I go, $/day, ROI/month, premium/collateral, and so on. I will need to watch all of these and more to reach my goal.\n\n# My First Trade\n\nLooking at the stocks in my filter, there are two that really stand out to me: GME and PLTR. That's right, everyones favorite meme stocks!\n\nGameStop is interesting as a short-term play, and has very high IV. But I'm not confident in the company as a long-term play, and would hate to be assigned hundreds of shares of that shitty brick and mortar hellscape. Palantir, on the other hand, has serious growth potential long-term and I would not mind being assigned. It has also been hit hard recently and is at a more reasonable entry level, which also makes it a good choice. **Therefore, I will be trading PLTR as my first play.**\n\nI want to sell an OTM put to give myself some downside protection against a further drop, but not so far OTM that I can't break my 100% ROI goal. Let's plug some of the Jan. 15 options into my formula above to get a breakdown of the potential ROI.\n\n21 strike: 74.2\n\n22 strike: 108.4\n\n22.5 strike: 131.9\n\n23 strike: 155.5\n\nEither the 22 or 22.5 strikes are right near the sweet spot we are looking for in terms of return. Of course conditions will likely change on Monday and I may need to reassess, but at the moment my current play seems to be:\n\n**Sell to Open 3 contracts of PLTR 22p 1/15.**\n\nIf Monday opens red it will be even better for us, since we get in at a cheaper price with likely higher IV on top. So I for one am praying for a bloody Monday for Palantir (sorry bagholders).\n\nOf course after selling 3 contracts at 22 strike, we will only have used $6600 of our $8000 capital. I may need to look for one more smallish trade on a stock in the $14 range to take full advantage of our capital. If GME drops on Monday we could consider a far OTM play there, for instance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR- I am going to double a small account, and you are going to watch.**\n\nI will update this post as plays are made, and will create a new post each month as a recap. As always questions are welcome.",

Musk predicts that by the end of the year, Tesla's cars will be able to navigate both surface streets and freeways, allowing them to drive between any two points without human input.\n&gt; \n&gt; At this point, the cars will be \"feature complete,\" in Musk's terminology, but will still need a human driver to monitor the vehicle and intervene in the case of a malfunction. But Musk predicts it will only take about six more months for the software to become reliable enough to no longer require human supervision. By the end of 2020, Musk expects Tesla to have thousands of Tesla vehicles providing driverless rides to people in an Uber-style taxi service.\n&gt; \n&gt; In other words, Musk seems to believe that once Tesla's cars become \"feature complete\" later this year, they will be 90 percent of the way to full autonomy.

        "selftext": "I got two goals here. One is for you to understand what Salesforce and SAP really do instead of just \"cloud\" and \"software\" and why Salesforce will become like SAP. The second is to tell you what to expect with CRM price and how to make tendies.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst you gotta understand what exactly SAP does and what happened with their stock. SAP is one of the largest software companies which focus on ERP. What the fuck is ERP you might ask? ERP is what other businesses use to track business resources. This ranges from everything such as planning and optimizing manufacturing capacity to dealing with payroll for employees. Basically companies don't want to create their own software for handling these wide range of tasks and pay SAP a shit load of money to do it for them. Where's the problem you might ask? Unless you are involved with one of these companies that use SAP, it's difficult to understand what the experience is like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/htsfvr8uro861.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db3b665c95ce5d62639a4dc0e5d9469a08510cbd\n\nBasically a company pays SAP to use their software for dealing with one of these areas of ERP. This generally works fine since SAP has used their business management software with a lot of companies for the same tasks. The issue is when one of these companies want to [customize the software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning#Disadvantages) to meet unique demands for the company. This re-engineering process to fit the ERP system for many tasks ends up costing more for a company and wasting a lot of time and money. Interestingly enough, you can ask almost any business about their experience with SAP and they will all say that they're unhappy even though they use their software. So what you might ask, wouldn't SAP still be generating tons of revenue? Well yes but more of these companies are moving away from this way of doing ERP as it is an inflexible approach. This is becoming replaced by more loosely connected systems utilizing cloud instead of having a one solves all solution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ugj07ez0to861.png?width=984&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c45c19bcdd0e10bd643286730aa3a2beeec0ae20\n\nLet's look at how their financial earnings and stock price have reflected this. In the past two years this stock has traded relatively sideways with some really bad drops. Around May to August their stock price went up 60% do to the hype around cloud companies benefiting from COVID. However it has obviously taken a really bad fall when October earnings were announced. They claimed that there was slower recovery than anticipated for many of its clients. However I suspect that many of these companies have been looking to shift away from SAP as the pandemic has shown the importance of the flexibility of these systems. By looking at their past quarters, you can see that their quarterly revenue has been flat around the 8 billion range and the company is clearly having a difficult time changing their business model. Other cloud companies are replacing their solutions as SAP's clients move away from their software even though SAP is trying to shift to [modern cloud technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP#Corporate_restructuring). Generally though companies have a hard time changing their business approach from the old way of doing things to the new way of doing things. \n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow the important part. What the fuck does SAP's troubles have to do with Salesforce. As you may have guessed from the ticker Salesforce provides CRM or customer relationship management. [CRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management) is a specific area in ERP dealing with customer services. For example a company may want a software for their call center or to automate a marketing effort. Salesforce provides software to do this along with analytics of this data so that these businesses can make informed decisions.\n\nAs you may have already guessed Salesforce is facing some similar problems that SAP deal with. When a company decides to expand their CRM software to deal with more parts of their business, the inflexibility and costs quickly become apparent. [For example, many corporations only use CRM systems on a partial basis and less than 40 percent of companies have high end-user adoption rates.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management#Criticism) Again if you are not familiar with software development and companies using these software vendors it is difficult to fully understand these troubles. I would strongly recommend researching the issues of customizing ERP or CRM software for a specific company if you are not convinced. While Salesforce tries to provide an all in one solution for their clients, customization becomes complicated and prices become costly. These customizations become difficult to do and take a lot of time, planning, and money. Companies are becoming more inclined to take a different approach for building these systems. In a lot of these cases it is easier for a business to build their own system in the cloud using products from companies such as Microsoft or Amazon for more customizability. \n\nAnother big issue is the concern over customer data with CRM systems. A company might opt to develop their own CRM systems where they can ensure that customer data is obeying customer privacy laws and allows them to have more control over private data. This can help build a better relationship with the customer. Privacy issues over customer data has obviously become a big issue in 2020.\n\nFurthermore, Salesforce has been trying to get into more areas with [recent acquisitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salesforce). Similar to SAP, I suspect that Salesforce will crush over their own weight as they try to expand their company. One good example of this is their recent acquisition of Slack. Slack does not really fit any of Salesforce ecosystem and is really just an attempt to expand into a different area. Slack has a lot of competition from Microsoft teams and other companies which can do what Slack does but better. \n\nBusiness will start to move away from Salesforce similar to SAP. This is not to say that they be completely independent as Salesforce does make some parts of the businesses easier. However there seems to be a strong resemblance to SAP based on what I know from inside of a corporation using both SAP and Salesforce and the many issues they face when they try and customize their solutions.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo how can we use this information to print tendies? The expectation is that Salesforce will eventually slow their growth down while stock is overhyped due to being a cloud company and start to fall or go sideways like SAP. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vl629rb14p861.png?width=927&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4282ffef17bd83b9a62a7f196974d0113511b1d5\n\nBasically the idea is to try and play puts, especially around earnings. If Salesforce misses their guidance then it could the stock in a serious reversal especially for a cloud company with a lot of hype. The next earnings will be early March.\n\nYou can also try and play longer term puts but the stock is fairly volatile like SAP and I would only do this if you see the price go up significantly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr; buy puts in march \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclosure: long on GME \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "**TLDR:**\n\nTesla enters 2021 with huge tailwinds. Bullish for the first half of the year. More caution in the second half as competing EV products start entering the market at an accelerating pace. Biggest risk is the market discounting the effect of strong EV competition starting in 2021. Avoid shorting TSLA.\n\n# The 2021 TSLA trade plan\n\n## What moves the stock?\n\nKnowing that TSLA is decoupled from its business metrics, an inquisitive investor will wonder what drives the stock's price. The answer is partially uncovered by understanding who owns the stock. According to Macroaxis.com, as of December 30th, Institutions own 42.52% of Tesla's stock, the Public (i.e. Retail Investors) owns 37.46%, and Insiders own 20.02%.\n\n&gt;Institutional investors aren't selling\n\nTSLA's institutional investor base consists of large passive funds such as funds tracking the S&amp;P500 (which recently added TSLA) to more active hedge funds specializing in innovation and growth. Passive funds increase the buying pressure of TSLA while adding minimal selling pressure. Today, the majority of the workforce regularly contributes their salary to passive funds for retirement and said funds are unlikely to trim their holdings of a stock unless during an infrequent rebalancing event. The active funds that remain invested in TSLA tend to have celestial expectations for the company and are also unlikely to sell at this valuation. For example, billionaire fund manager Ron Baron believes that Tesla, currently at a $659 billion market cap, should be a $2 trillion dollar company. Another major fund manager, Cathie Wood, gives TSLA a 2024 price target of $7,000. Assuming minimal changes in total float, that equates to almost a $7 trillion dollar market cap!\n\nSo TSLA's institutional investor base are hardly sellers of TSLA and still believe there is significant room for the stock to run despite its incredible 2020 performance.\n\n&gt;Retail investors aren't selling\n\nWhat about TSLA's retail investor base? This question is easily answered. Over the years, TSLA has built a diehard fanbase that has equally high, if not higher, expectations of the company than some of the institutional investors. Some people believe the company's CEO, Elon Musk, has developed a cult-of-personality. Tesla's cult-like fanbase manifests online as a large number of YouTube channels and online forums dedicated to the company, and in a broader sense, Elon Musk. For example, the main Tesla subreddit, r/ teslamotors, has more than 901,000 subscribers at the time of writing.\n\n&gt;Insiders aren't selling\n\nOf the remaining 20% of TSLA stock, the majority is held by Elon Musk and he's certainly not eager to sell noticeable quantities of his holdings given the ensuing bad PR.\n\nSo if investors are hesitant to sell TSLA, TSLA is bound to appreciate aggressively every time there's good news and appreciate slowly in the absence of news as passive funds and its ardent fanbase continue to buy in. In other words, TSLA is a heavily news-driven stock with a heavy bias for upside.\n\nThis is exactly what we saw in 2020. TSLA entered the year having solved its Model 3 production problems while managing to maintain solvent. This act alone unceremoniously discarded a dark cloud over the company on whether it'll manage to produce cars at scale before its heavy debt-burden catches up with the company's treasury. With that, the path was clear for a string of good news to catapult the stock to grandiose heights. They included the opening of the Shanghai factory, the 5-for-1 stock split, the S&amp;P500 inclusion, and record sales and deliveries in the third quarter. Even good news from the tangentially-related company SpaceX, who Elon Musk is also the CEO of, has been positive for TSLA.\n\n# The Plan and Headwinds\n\nTesla will enter 2021 with boosted by tailwinds from its 2020 success. If Tesla maintains its current pace of execution, ceteris paribus (fancy business major speak for \"all other things being equal\"), its stock price is expected to continue to appreciate and befuddle its critics. Tesla is finally able to produce Model 3's at scale, has a foothold in the Chinese market, and is readying to launch the Cybertruck to a red-hot North American pickup truck market. In addition, like Pavlov's dogs, 2020 has conditioned investors to not bet against TSLA with the stock shrugging off multiple negative news events like the COVID-19 pandemic, the expected post-S&amp;P500 inclusion sell-off (which never happened), and the Apple EV announcement.\n\n**In 2021, it's recommended to continue to avoid shorting Tesla, no matter how tempting.**\n\nWith that said, there are significant headwinds facing Tesla that any long positions should be aware of. Tesla currently has an 81.66% market share of the US EV market. The biggest risk going into 2021 and beyond is the significant ramp up in EV and battery technology competition from legacy auto manufacturers. Tesla's stock price has only emboldened the executive teams of these companies to pour significant resources into their EV businesses. GM, Volkswagen, and Ford are leading the pack. GM has invested $27 billion into its EV business and is planning to launch 30 EVs by 2025. Two EVs have already been announced: the Cadillac Lyriq and the Hummer EV, with both receiving an overwhelmingly positive public response. GM has also developed an in-house battery technology called Ultium that's the central pillar for its 2025 plan. A step above GM, Volkswagen is investing $41 billion into its EV business and plans to launch 70 EVs by 2030. It's also aggressively investing in battery technology. For example, Volkswagen has a large stake in QuantumScape, a company that claims to be developing a revolutionary solid-state battery technology. Last but not least, Ford is investing $11 billion into its EV business and plans to launch 40 EVs by 2022. Deliveries of its flagship EV, the well-received Mustang Mach-E, is already underway. An honorable mention goes to Apple, which plans to start production of its own EV in 2024.\n\nIf TSLA is a news-driven stock, a growing string of negative news about the company's shrinking North American and European market share should apply downward pressure on price. The worry is that investors are so exuberant about the stock's stellar 2020 performance that the effects of emergent, serious competition from legacy auto manufacturers are heavily discounted.\n\n**In 2021, although it remains very bullish for TSLA going into the first half of the year, it's recommended to avoid aggressively starting or adding more to an existing position in the latter half of the year. This is when the rate of competing EV products entering the North American and European markets is expected to accelerate. Prudent investors should watch how the public reacts to this large structural EV market change before making any moves.**\n\nI wrote about stock market DD here: [FinanceTLDR blog](https://www.financetldr.com)",

        "selftext": "This is my first DD so I hope it goes well.\n\nCC Neuberger Principal Holdings I (PCPL) has an agreement to merge with E2OPEN.\n\n**What is E2OPEN?**: E2OPEN is a cloud-based, artificial intelligence, on-demand SaaS platform company. E2OPEN is the largest cloud-based provider of networked supply chain applications. More than 70,000 partner companies and 200,000 users, many of the biggest companies in the world use the E2OPEN network today.\n\n**Who are E2OPEN's customers?**: Some of their customers include Google, Facebook, AMD, Nvidia, Intel, HP, IBM etc. [Complete list taken from the investor presentation.](https://i.imgur.com/FfcVX7o.png)\n\n**Who is leading the SPAC?**: The founder &amp; CEO of PLPC is Chinh Chu. A billionaire with 30+ years of investment experience, including 25 years at [Blackstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blackstone_Group). He has created 3 SPACs since 2016. The first SPAC, CF Corp, raised $1.2 billion and successfully merged with Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Life. The second SPAC, Collier Creek Holdings, raised $475 million and successfully merged with a company in the consumer sector. And now we have his most recent, third SPAC, PCPL. It has raised $414 million and will merge with E2OPEN. This man was also in charge of taking Dun &amp; Bradstreet private in a large $7.2 billion deal. Before joining Blackstone in 1990, this man also worked in the Mergers &amp; Acquisitions Deparment at Salomon Brothers. His experience is undeniable. \n\n**Backstory**: E2OPEN used to be a public company. Their stock price went as high as $28. They were bought by a private company and were taken off the market in 2015. Ever since they were taken private, E2OPEN was able to grow from $80M in revenue 5 years ago to $335M in 2020. They have acquired a handful of companies and continue to do so. E2OPEN's revenue is about four times what it was in 2015. The percent of revenue that is subscription-based, which is always a key metric for a SaaS company, was 80% in fiscal 2020 and is expected to grow in 2021. It also stands to benefit as companies automate their supply chains further in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**The potential negatives:** Their estimated revenue for next year is about +10%. There was an additional funding from instutions through a private investment in public equity (PIPE) of $175M which will be used to pay down existing debt. E2OPEN traded publicly before they were acquired by another company. Their stock price went as high as $28 but also went as low as $8. They were then acquired by Insight Venture Partners and have grown since. \n\n**The Merger**: SPAC shareholders will own 20% of the shares. The merger has a valuation of $2.57B. Upon closing of the transaction with E2OPEN, the ticker will change from 'PCPL' to 'ETWO'.\n\n**TL:DR:** A cloud-based SaaS platform company with customers from some of the biggest corporations in the world today, has a definitive agreement to merge with 'PCPL'. PCPL is run by a billionaire with an unbelievable resume that has already had two previous successful SPAC mergers and this is his third SPAC. The company's revenue has grown massively and their revenue today is about four times higher than it was in 2015. The percent of their revenue that is subscription-based is 80% and is expected to grow in the future. \n\n**Disclaimer:** I own 420 shares of PCPL. Invest at your own risk. As of this writing the price of PCPL is **$10,84.**",

        "selftext": "When placing trades, I think of calls and puts at the same strike and expiry. You can convert between the two using 100 shares of long or short stock. The fundamental reason is that the extrinsic value is identical. \n\nSince everyone is following PLTR these days, let's use it as an example:  \n\n\\-----------------------\n\nSelling a $22 put = Buying 100 shares and selling a call at $22 (OTM CSP = ITM CC)\n\nBuying 100 shares and selling a call at $30 = Selling a $30 put at $30 (OTM CC = ITM CSP)\n\nGetting assigned a cash-secured put at $25, then selling a covered call at $25 = Rolling the $25 put out in time (CSP assignment, then selling a CC = put calendar) \n\nGetting assigned your covered call at $20, then selling a cash-secured put at $20 = Rolling the $20 call out in time (CC assignment, then selling a CSP = call calendar) \n\nBuying 100 shares and buying a put at $25 = Buying a call at $25 (Married put = Call) \n\nShorting 100 shares and buying a call at $25 = Buying a put at $25 (Married call = Put)\n\nBuying 100 shares, buying ATM put, selling OTM call = Buying ATM call, selling OTM call (Collar = Call debit spread) \n\nBuying 100 shares = selling a put, buying a call at the same strike (100 shares = Short put + long call) \n\n\\----------------------\n\nIn practice, these equivalencies have important caveats/exceptions\n\n\\- ITM options are less liquid\n\n\\- In normal skew situations, OTM puts are slightly more expensive than the ITM calls, benefitting put sellers\n\n\\- In reverse skew situations (highly specutive stocks), OTM calls are more expensive than the ITM put, benefitting call sellers\n\n\\- If a stock is hard to short, puts are more expensive across all strikes, benefitting put sellers\n\n\\- Some positions require more buying power then the equivalent position\n\n\\- Holding stock gives you dividends \n\n\\- Holding short calls elevates early assignment risk due to dividends \n\n\\- The more legs a trade has, the harder it is to fill\n\n\\----------------------\n\nExperienced traders - did I make any mistakes?

R. R. Tolkien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien)'s [Middle-earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth) [legendarium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolkien%27s_legendarium). A *palant\u00edr* (from [Quenya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quenya) *palan*, 'far; *tir*, 'watch over'[\\[T 1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palant%C3%ADr#cite_note-1)) is described as an indestructible [ball of crystal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_ball), used for communication and to see events in other parts of [Arda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arda_(Middle-earth)), whether past or future.' - Is this what Palantir will do in the future? See the past or future with their powerful programmes?\n\nMithril:\n\nThe scholar of English literature Charles A. Huttar writes that *mithril* was the only mineral that Tolkien invented. He notes that in Tolkien's underworld, whether the [caves at Helm's Deep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glittering_Caves_of_Aglarond) or the mines of Moria, \"beauty and terror \\[were\\] side by side\".[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithril#cite_note-Huttar_1975-12) Greed for *mithril* could unleash the terror of the [Balrog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balrog), by digging too far down into the dark realm, but at the same time, he writes, the metal was prized for both its beauty and its usefulness, yielding the best armour. He compares the Dwarves' greed for *mithril* with that of the Barrow-wights for treasure, and indeed that of the [dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon) in [*The Hobbit*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit) and [*Beowulf*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf) for gold. In his view, these symbolise the evil \"inherent in the mineral treasures hidden in the womb of Earth\",[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithril#cite_note-Huttar_1975-12) just as mining and metalwork are associated with [Satan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satan) in [John Milton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Milton)'s [*Paradise Lost*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost) (I, 670-751). Huttar sums up with a reflection on Tolkien's moral vision in the story: just as the characters at every point have to decide for good or ill, so objects have the potential to be both good and evil: \"Mithril is both the greatest of treasures and a deadly bane. \n\nDoes Peter Thiel actually use the names that have meanings behind them on what the company is going to achieve or is it just some cool names chosen from the LOTR universe?\n\nAs we can see Mithril can be used for good and ill, will that be the case with Palantir? If it gets in the wrongs hands could that bring a deadly bane or if it gets into the good hands could that bring the greatest treasure?\n\nDoes that basically mean I am too retarded or are we going to the moon on this rocket  \ud83d\ude80 ?",

        "selftext": "Amazing to see this ticker still brought up on this thread at times. Let\u2019s dive into the countless red flags this company has produced in the last several months.\n\nLet\u2019s start with Bruce Bernstein. Currently on the board of directors for XSPA. Many allegations brought against him for fraud relating to the company.\n\nBernstein securities fraud [Bruce securities fraud case ](https://www.teribuhl.com/2019/03/11/ny-journalist-wins-lawsuit-to-unseal-court-docs-tied-to-bruce-bernstein-securities-fraud-case-xspa/)\n\n[SEC violations ](https://www.teribuhl.com/2018/09/19/rockmore-capitals-bruce-bernstein-ex-wife-outs-him-for-possible-sec-violations-in-xspa-deal/)\n\n[More allegations](https://www.scribd.com/document/408580774/Rockmore-Capital-Bruce-Bernstein-TRO-in-XpresSpa-fraud-suit-April-29-2019)\n\nReverse splits: XSPA performed a R/S in February of 2019, and June of 2020. That\u2019s right, two within two years. The recent R/S has watched their stock bleed from near $7-$8 levels, to the current SP of $1.23. A constant 6 months downtrend. 9.8/10 reverse splits NEVER work out for the companies performing them. \n\nBlatant lies from the CEO: Not going to touch on all of them since there\u2019s been so many. CEO stated in August there was no need for more offerings unless they \u201cwent gangbusters\u201d. 4 days later they issued a direct offering. Headed into 2021 they have 5 locations up and running. Gangbusters no doubt.\n\nHe then stated there was no need for another offering for 2020. What happened 2 weeks ago. You guessed it, another offering! They released their 8K announcing their partnership with United airlines (which by the way is only for flights heading to Hawaii and nothing more). Another offering after a $0.30 pop in SP. Shows you exactly how confident they are in their new business venture.\n\nWarrants: There are warrants at $5.25, $3.02, and now $1.70. After each offering the SP has never crossed the warrants exercisable price. Not once. For the higher warrants, the institutions likely dumped their shares at break even and shorted on the way down, using the warrants as their hedge. So much warrant saturation.\n\nShares remaining: Around 2 million shares remain to be distributed. Means not enough shares for offerings. They will likely have to vote on adding more shares to the float, thus diluting even more. What would happen after? Likely another R/S. Their third in 3 consecutive years. \n\nRevenue model: XSPA is paid strictly as a landlord. They do not make money per test administered. The MSA agreement was necessary since they aren\u2019t in the medical field. \n\nReporting revenue: XSPA cannot report their revenue until they have 2-3 (sometimes 4) consecutive quarters of contract income due to GAAP laws. This means they will not be able to report their income earned from testing next quarter. \n\nSabby/ intracoastel: There\u2019s no denying they have shorted this into oblivion. With no revenue to report in makes it an easy target. Many have suggested their recent buy in was \u201cfor the ride up\u201d what ride would that be? \n\nThe Spa business: Their spas failed to turn a profit for 63 straight consecutive quarters. Doing roughly 40-45 million per year in revenue. Let\u2019s assume for their new testing venture, they\u2019re paid 1 million in MSA fees per testing site. Right now that would be 5 million per quarter, 20 million per year. Far less then the failing spas were generating. \n\nI see people on here and Stocktwits holding out hope. If you\u2019re holding in the $3\u2019s, $4\u2019s, $5\u2019s and hell even $6\u2019s which I\u2019ve sadly seen. Please cut your losses. High $1\u2019s to mid $2\u2019s you could possibly break even on the random spike that happens to many penny stocks. Only saving grace would be for testing to be mandated before boarding any airplane regardless of destination.",

        "selftext": "In 2020, there was clearly a large divergence in the performance of different classes of REITs after COVID-19 hit.\n\n**Industrial REITs:** these recovered well after COVID hit, as industrial workplaces reopened and there was actually an increase in demand for warehouses and logistics facilities, to support e-commerce.  For example, from Jan 1 to Dec 31:\n\n* Granite (GRT) is up 18% \n* Summit Industrial (SMU) is up 13%\n* Dream Industrial (DIR) had no change\n* WPT Industrial (WIR) is down 3%\n\n**Residential REITs**: these are down from where they started 2020, but recovered most of their value.  In some places, occupancy rates dropped as workplaces and universities went online and as people lost jobs, causing some to move in with family to save on rent, while others accelerated plans to become homeowners to have more space to work from home. For example, from Jan 1 to Dec 31:\n\n* Canadian Apartments (CAR) is down 6%,\n* Killam (KMP) is down 10%\n* Minto (MI) is down 12%\n* InterRent (IIP) is down 12%\n* Boardwalk (BEI) is down 27%\n\n**Retail REITS**: these were often harder hit, as retail businesses saw reduced foot traffic, due to lockdowns, capacity limits, and people staying home to avoid exposure to the virus. E-commerce and deliveries surged as an alternative to in-person shopping, and it's not clear what the long-term impacts will be on brick-and-mortar stores.  For example, from Jan 1 to Dec 31:\n\n* Canadian Tire (CRT) is down 3%\n* Choice Properties (CHP) is down 6%\n* Slate Grocery (SGR) is down 14%\n* Plaza (PLZ) is down 21%\n* SmartCentres (SRU) is down 26%\n* RioCan (REI) is down 37%\n\n**Office REITS**: these seem to have been hit the hardest.  Many office-based workplaces sent their employees home to work remotely, and there are questions about whether that trend will persist, and whether companies will choose to cut back on their office space in the future, for the cost savings.  For example, from Jan 1 to Dec 31:\n\n* True North Commerical (TNT) is down 13%\n* Allied Properties (AP) is down 27%\n* Slate Office (SOT) is down 29%\n* Dream Office (D) is down 36%\n\nSo with all of that in mind, my question is: which category of REIT will perform best in 2021, in terms of rise or fall in share price?\n\nAnd as a bonus question: which individual REIT do you think will perform best in 2021?

Feel free to do your own DD but i think after that you\u2019ll be on this boat with me.

Which has world renound / very well known delivery technology and development solution for drugs, biologics, and consumer and animal health products.               \n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/21/2148705/0/en/Novan-Engages-Catalent-to-Develop-Intranasal-Formulation-of-Berdazimer-Sodium-for-COVID-19-Program.html\n\n\u201cNovan initiated in vitro assessments of its NITRICIL\u2122 platform against the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, targeting the reduction of viral burden in differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial cells.\u201d\n\n\u201cBased on the scientific literature and data available to-date with berdazimer sodium and  Novan\u2019s product candidate SB206, Novan believes that nitric oxide may inhibit viral replication by disrupting protein function critical for viral replication and infection through generation of reactive intermediates.\u201d\n\n\u201cFollowing the initial positive in vitro results that we announced earlier, we believe berdazimer sodium has the potential to offer benefit in inhibiting the replication of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and we look forward to further exploring its potential.\u201d\n\n\u201cFollowing the completion of preclinical studies, Novan is targeting filing a potential IND application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and, subject to obtaining additional funding, targets initiating human clinical trials in the second half of 2021.\u201d\n\n\n\nSo, with that being said, the stock had traded around 1.0-1.1$ on Wednesday, the 29th, and dropped to where it has been consolidating with around .8-.9$ a share with VERY bullish outlooks, and there seems to be resistence around .8. When it was at 1.0$-1.1, it was being traded with a daily of 160mil volume, the stock didnt get much attention friday so it was very easily manipulated down the ranks. All in all i have great hopes for the outlook of 2021. Thank You.",

Open and read these points before every trade you make.\n\n2. Buy options that are no less than 4 weeks from expiring. Ideally, they would have at least 8 weeks until expiration or longer.\n\n3. Buy calls or puts at the money or close to it. \n\n4. STOP JUMPING INTO STOCKS THAT YOU HAVE NOT MONITORED FOR AT LEAST 1-2 WEEKS.\n\na. This will give you an idea of what the stock is doing and the type of price action you are stepping into. \n\nb. If you miss out before entry, move on to another stock. They are plenty of stocks in the sea. \n\n5. Remember past events or trade outcomes will not determine how a new trade works out. If the stock is not going in the direction you thought it would GET OUT! Do not waste time wondering why and or going against what the price action is saying or doing. \n\n6. As much as you can, remove your emotions. Become a robot when it comes to trading. \n\n7. STOP CHASING THE MONEY YOU HAVE LOST!!!!!!!\n\n8. STOP ALLOWING YOURSELF TO HAVE DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR. Its okay to dream just not in stock trading. Take profits when you can. It is okay if you make 5-10% in a trade before pulling the trigger. Not every trade will turn out to be 100% or 1000% return. \n\n9. Pay attention when Cramer pounds the table about a stock. Buy long dated Calls.\n\n10. YOU NEED VOLUME for a stock to move.

Since my husband and I use fidelity, we considered setting up a brokerage account and letting them pick an index fund so they have some involvement too.

Feel free to do your own DD but i think after that you\u2019ll be on this boat with me. Very Convincing. \n\nRecently, NOVN, A North Carolina Clinical developement stage biotech company, has enetered an MSA agreement with Catalent, $CTLT. Which has world renound / very well known delivery technology and development solution for drugs, biologics, and consumer and animal health products.               \n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/21/2148705/0/en/Novan-Engages-Catalent-to-Develop-Intranasal-Formulation-of-Berdazimer-Sodium-for-COVID-19-Program.html\n\n\u201cNovan initiated in vitro assessments of its NITRICIL\u2122 platform against the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, targeting the reduction of viral burden in differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial cells.\u201d\n\n\u201cBased on the scientific literature and data available to-date with berdazimer sodium and  Novan\u2019s product candidate SB206, Novan believes that nitric oxide may inhibit viral replication by disrupting protein function critical for viral replication and infection through generation of reactive intermediates.\u201d\n\n\u201cFollowing the initial positive in vitro results that we announced earlier, we believe berdazimer sodium has the potential to offer benefit in inhibiting the replication of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and we look forward to further exploring its potential.\u201d\n\n\u201cFollowing the completion of preclinical studies, Novan is targeting filing a potential IND application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and, subject to obtaining additional funding, targets initiating human clinical trials in the second half of 2021.\u201d\n\n\n\nSo, with that being said, the stock had traded around 1.0-1.1$ on Wednesday, the 29th, and dropped to where it has been consolidating with around .8-.9$ a share with VERY bullish outlooks, and there seems to be resistence around .8. When it was at 1.0$-1.1, it was being traded with a daily of 160mil volume, the stock didnt get much attention friday so it was very easily manipulated down the ranks.

        "selftext": "Ticker BABA on the nasdaq\n\nGo easy since its my first piece of DD, and I'm doing this to get different inputs on the company\n\nReason for DD: stock id down almost 30% from ATH\n\nI do not own any shares of alibaba \n\n \n\n*Processing img 8845zmm21r861...*\n\n**Quantitative assessment**\n\nAlibaba is a leading platform for global wholesale trade that serve million of buyers and suppliers around the world (mainly known for being prominent in Asia)\n\nLike amazon, their core e-commerce business consists of connecting third party sellers into one platform but, unlike amazon, they do not hold inventory and do not store /ship it.\n\n**How they make money**\n\n**E-commerce:** They make the main bulk of their money by charging a commission fee from transactions and a subscription fee to sellers. They say a 29% YoY growth in their revenues here.\n\n**Cloud operations:** From Investopedia: \u201cAlibaba Cloud provides enterprise customers with a complete suite of cloud services, including database, storage, management and application services, big data analytics, a machine-learning platform, and other services. The company's cloud computing segment generates revenue from enterprise customers based on the duration and specific usage of the services.\u201d This is the fastest growing segment of their business, reaching a 60% YoY revenue growth \n\n**Entertainment:** it\u2019s a small part of their business and generates subscription-based revenue (8% YoY revenue growth)\n\nIn Q3 2020, 84% of their revenue can be attributed to commerce and the other 16% to cloud/entertainment/innovation initiatives and others (10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively)\n\nBeing such a large company, they touch many sectors, lots of which are expected to keep growing quickly in the future.\n\n**Management**\n\nWould love to hear your input on this one (i.e. I'm too lazy to look into the decisions they make and I don't know how I feel about Jack Ma)\n\n**Competition**\n\nTheir main competitor is Amazon, but other ones include eBay and Tencent holdings (the latter a Chinese tech company). Alibaba is very dominant in the Asian e-commerce markets. \n\n**Recent concerns**\n\nAt the time of this writing, the stock is down almost 27% from its late-October peak, a drop in price attributed to a recent antitrust investigation launched by the Chinese government for monopolistic behavior by essentially forcing sellers to chose only a single e-commerce platform. Additionally, Ant Group (their fintech sister company) had been denied an IPO a while back and keeps getting scrutiny from the government. The main risk here for Alibaba might be that they\u2019re forced to divest some parts of their business. Personally, I think monopolistic concerns could keep emerging in the future as the company keeps growing however, I believe that despite these concerns, they can still strive as a business. There's plenty of YouTube videos and financial articles that cover this so I recommend those for more details.\n\n**Quantitative assessment (USD)**\n\nMarket cap: $650B \n\nQ3 2020 revenue: $22,8M (up 30% YoY, with forward projected growth of 36%)\n\nA few metrics stacked up against competitors (for the readers interpretation):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xte5e455qq861.png?width=1357&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c1eb19bda6e576e1a2c8675fd7ca35f55a7baec\n\nThe recent drop in share price has BABA trading at a discount compared to its main competitor amazon. Growing revenues in all aspects of their business mentioned above is encouraging to see as well. \n\nAlibaba seems to offer great value in an expensive tech market (especially considering the low PE ratio despite growing their revenues pretty fast), the main question is: are the risks of Chinese government regulations that can be imposed on the company worth the opportunity? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI skimmed through the company pretty quickly and there's plenty of details in their fundamental business that I didn't talk about, I just tried to give a big picture view. I recommend also doing your own research on the risks with this company since government investigations seem complex and there's other risks such as the fact that you're actually buying a holding company legally domiciled in the Cayman Islands.  \n\n That Investopedia article I referred to: [How Alibaba Makes Money: core e-commerce, cloud computing, digital media and entertainment (investopedia.com)](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/121714/how-does-alibaba-make-money-simple-guide.asp) \n\nAlibaba q3 results presentation:  [Alibaba Group September Quarter 2020 Results](https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/ir/presentations/pre201105.pdf) \n\nActual q3 financial results pdf: [Microsoft Word - Alibaba Group Announces September Quarter 2020 Results\\_vF](https://alibabagroup.com/en/news/press_pdf/p201105.pdf) \n\nI would love to hear your thoughts on Alibaba\n\nAlso, happy new year!",

        "selftext": "Happy New Year everyone. Some of us would have had great year this year in the market and some not. However, we can all take the lessons learnt into this year to become better traders/investors.\n\nI didn't actually start until 2 months ago, and thanks to this community, I was able to pick a few winners (although had to sieve through a bunch of p&amp;ds and making mistakes along the way). Below are somethings I learnt (all circumstantial and isn't always the case) and hope it helps some of you. Feel free to disagree wit any of them and let me know what some of ur lessons learnt are!\n\n1) Gap ups at open are usually followed by sharp drops before stabilising. Depending on your style of trading this is a great way for you to flip. But for me, the opening 5 to 10 minutes is most often too volatile to make decisions. When I first begun, I used to see a company I like, see a massive spike up, try to follow the train, only to get burnt buying near the top before the inevitable drop a few minutes after.\n\n2) its fine to take profits even if it means missing out on more gains if that stock continues to skyrocket. This depends on your amount of DD and trust in what you put money in. Prime example for me was BNGO. Avg at 0.7, sold at 0.8. Sure if I've held, could have made much more, but in that time, I was able to use my profits to make even more on other stocks. I couldn't have know it would have continued to rocket. Another strategy is just put a stop loss, and let it ride.\n\n3) if you are lucky to have one of your investments return over 100% (which I think it's actually quite common with penny stocks although I might be naive in this thinking), it's safer to take out the initial investment and just let the profit ride. But if you really know and trust your investment, then the risk of leaving your initial investment is worth it. Prime example for me was ABML, hit 100% quite early but took out initial investment, looking back, I would have let it all ride out.\n\n4) There are some absolute gems of DDs in here by high level contributors (you know who you are) and this is my own personal opinion. If you are already seeing multiple posts about the same ticker flooding the page already, it's probably had its run. Sure, it might have more room to run and you can risk it and jump on a moving train. But for me, the most effective strategy has been looking at tickers mentions which are still relatively less hyped. This way I can get on and know that once it starts running, I can ride out the up and downs, because my average is so low. The problem with jumping on the moving trains are that, those with the low averages will keep trying to pump it, knowing they can survive the few intra or multiple day dumps, but for you guys who are asking for example if it's time to still jump in things like BNGO or CUVO, after it's already run a few multiple 100% days, you have to do it accepting you are taking a massive risk. Again, this isn't always the case. E.g ALPP, most people were scared to jump in at like 0.5 or 0.6 etc because it was already running like crazy, so they were waiting for a dip that never really came. This again goes back to trusting ur instincts about the company and do some DD.\n\n5) If you have faith in a company and a strategy, trust it even when there are massive dips. Over the last few days, ALPP has taking some beatings (still minor compared to how much it has run). When I first started, I would get scared at the slightest drops, and if I have seen how much ALPP can drop when it decides to dip, I would have been shitting bricks. What I learnt was patience can sometimes pay off. Massive dips are usually followed by people picking shares up at a discount. Although it might not go all the way back up to what it was at open, selling during a dip has always worked out bad for me. What I do now is wait until the dip is over and let people push it back up and stabilise before I make a decision. Having said that, if I had no faith in the company and was only in it for a quick buck, I would just sell as it starts to drop and take my profits. \n\nThat's it for now and would love to hear your lessons learnt and what you hope the achieve in 2021. For me is to actually learn how to read the charts, and know how to analyse fundamentals. But currently I don't feel the necessasity, especially with fundamentals, I think (maybe naively again) the markets are currently being more sensitive to hype and PR more than the actual fundamentals. For chart reading wise, I don't know any of the actual technicals but just been learning my own patterns I see through experience and being burnt.\n\nGood luck with your 2021!",

Recent S-8 allows Barry Igdaloff to sell his shares into a secondary offering so Mr. Market will never see the hundreds of millions he may make by duplicating the Newcastle NCT reorganization at Novation Companies Inc. $NOVC. Call Wesley Edens, Peter Briger, Co-CEOs of Fortress or Emanuel J. Manny Friedman CEO of EJF Capital, or Mass Mutual Barings that have 19.3M shares of NOVC.

This could be a good entry point considering members of this sponsorship team, Jeff Sagansky and Harry Sloan, have closed numerous successful SPACs in the past - including $DKNG and $SKLZ...  Furthermore, this same team just filed to bring another new issue, Spinning Eagle Acquisition , so I interpret that to signal they must have multiple targets in mind and could be close to announcing a business combination for $FCAC in the coming months??\n\n$FEAC, which became $SKLZ (Skillz Mobile Gaming), IPO'd on March 5th and announced the DMA on September 2nd, slightly under 6 months - pretty quick considering the lockdown hit right after the deal priced...   $FCAC units priced on September 21st, roughly 3 months ago, so I would not be surprised to see a deal in the coming months...\n\nI noticed Benzinga picked this as one of their top 10 picks [Link to YouTube Video pump](https://youtu.be/9qjzsdwwfA4?t=844)\n\n\"@SpacGuru seems to like this one too [https://twitter.com/SpacGuru/status/1344682789434773505](https://twitter.com/SpacGuru/status/1344682789434773505)\n\nHere's the link to the management team in the prospectus, if you are interested in doing thorough DD [Officers and Directors](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1816233/000121390020028037/f424b4_falconcapitalacqcorp.htm#T11)\n\nAnd a few charts:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sv1shd91fq861.jpg?width=581&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a57b45310c3d47ae8462226393eeb553b4043eac\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9vmfqh5efq861.jpg?width=584&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=023df72fae6d0230ac08edca75262b8fe8efea3a\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zh8euwrkfq861.jpg?width=576&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3342e5f9275345c78673ef9bbeb9e6f2224c54c\n\nSeems like a no brainer to me - commons trading at 54 cent over NAV and serious upside potential if you are willing to hold it for a few months...

I don't have enough capital to really benefit from having 3 of their services, so I figured there might be some other folks on the same boat. If it makes it easier, I'm willing to buy a new service and add it to my account and then split the cost of the service with you and then share the account but I understand that some people might not feel comfortable with that. Otherwise we can share some of their picks via Google drive links or whatsoever. I know the risks of doing this but I'm ok gambling with it.\n\nAnyhow I got the Everlasting stock service for 2 years ($99) and If anyone wants to split the other services I can get them for $45 for the stock advisor and $99 for the Rulebreakers. I get random discount emails for Stock advisor at $45 but I know I can get it for 99$ reliably for a year. I only feel comfortable sharing with 3-4 other people but I doubt there will be enough interest. If I get 3-4 people on this we can split all 3 services at a maximum $100-$75 each which is better than spending $300 individually.  Otherwise just sharing their picks sounds good to me!\n\nCheers!",

I\u2019m having a hard time finding good videos that I feel I can trust. Every one is full of SmaSH tHAt SuBscRIBe BuTtOn, BRO! \n\nIf I understand correctly, most of my risk comes from having to buy back the contracts I sold, if they are about to go ITM when I need to roll them. OR if things tank big time and I want to exit my LEAPs, I have to buy back the sold contracts before I can sell the LEAPS, right? \n\nI wanted to try this method in a less risky position for myself before I used my expensive SPY leaps, so I sold a call against a $JETS 22 JAN $20 C, for like $40 with an expiration of early FEB, just to see what happens with it. I\u2019ll watch it for the month to get an idea of what happens, and hopefully combine that experience with any responses to this/ learning resources you guys recommend. \n\nThanks for any help and ideas.",

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week, month and year ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 4th, 2021.\n\n# **Politics will be front and center as a catalyst in the first week of the new year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/31/politics-will-be-front-and-center-as-a-catalyst-in-the-first-week-of-the-new-year-.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks exit 2020 with strong gains and are riding a tailwind, but already in the dawn of the new year, the market could face its first big challenge.\n*****\n&gt; The final outcome of the 2020 election plays out Tuesday, when voters in Georgia will pick their senators and decide which party controls the U.S. Senate.\n*****\n&gt; With President-elect Joe Biden heading to the White House and a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, Wall Street has been comfortable with the view that Biden and the Democrats could not succeed with tax hikes and more progressive policy changes while Republicans hold the Senate.\n*****\n&gt; The runoff election for the two Senate seats Tuesday is widely expected to result in one or both of the incumbent Republican senators retaining their seats. But Democrats are close in the polls and should they win, each party would have 50 seats with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the tie breaker.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cGeorgia is the most important thing to the Biden presidency for the next two years,\u201d said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. \u201cIt\u2019s going to determine what is the legislative agenda and who can get confirmed by the United States Senate.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Sen. David Perdue is being challenged by Democrat Jon Ossoff, while GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler is running against Democrat Raphael Warnock. None of the candidates had more than 50% of the vote in the Nov. 3 election, so Georgia law requires a runoff election between the two leading candidates for each seat.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s a binary event,\u201d said Mills, adding it\u2019s of growing interest to markets. \u201cThe general sense for the market is that Republicans are well positioned to maintain their majority in the Senate. But I think the 2020 election as well as the 2016 election and to some extent, the 2018 election has humbled us \u2026 The Senate outcomes, in particular, seem to be less predictable than almost any other elections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Mills said the results may take several days to determine, adding to the uncertainty the event could hold for markets. According to an RBC investor survey, 88% expect Republicans to maintain control, and most say that is a positive for the stock market.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market tends to shoot first and ask questions later. There will certainly be a reaction if Democrats win both those seats,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. Strategists say there could be a relief rally if Republican incumbents see a clear victory.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat totally dominates [trading] because it\u2019s about do we have status quo or do we have Democrats controlling all parts of Washington and what that means for spending and taxes,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI think you could see the worries about taxes overwhelming any thoughts on the benefits of more spending\u201d by Democrats.\n*****\n&gt; # By the numbers\n&gt; A year of extreme volatility ended with a big win for stocks, as the pandemic steered the course for markets. The S&amp;P 500 was up 16.3% for the year, ending at 3,756. That gain comes after a 34% decline early in the year, followed by a powerful more-than 65% rebound. Technology was the big winner for the year, and the Nasdaq was up 43.6% at 12,888.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the runoff vote, the market will be watching a stream of data in the coming week, including the important December jobs report Friday. That could show fewer than 100,000 jobs were added as the spreading virus impacted hiring and layoffs. There were 245,000 jobs created in November.\n*****\n&gt; There is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday, and a number of Fed speakers, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; The virus itself could also be a factor for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; Conventional wisdom for the coming year has been that vaccines will be widely distributed, and by the second half things will start to get back to normal and the economy will pick up. But the initial distribution has been slow, and far short of the 20 million targeted for December by President Donald Trump\u2019s task force.\n*****\n&gt; In that recent RBC survey, three quarters of investors were optimistic about vaccine distribution with 80% expecting a majority to be vaccinated by the end of 2021. \u201cWe suspect that the positive outlook for the stock market and the economy would deteriorate if expectations for a smooth vaccine rollout are not met,\u201d RBC strategists wrote.\n*****\n&gt; They also noted that nearly 60% of the investors surveyed believe high stock market valuations are problematic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis suggests to us that any threat to the economic and earnings recovery story could spark profit-taking. On this point, it is worth noting that the vaccine was the No. 1 issue keeping investors up at night, closely followed by monetary policy and excessive optimism on the recovery,\u201d the strategists noted.\n*****\n&gt; Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, said investors will also be watching the formal acceptance of the Electoral College vote Wednesday. Strategists expect the vote count to confirm Biden\u2019s presidency.\n*****\n&gt; However, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley says he will challenge the certification, and several House Republicans have already vowed to contest the election at that time. If one House member and a senator jointly object to a state\u2019s slate of electors, the two houses of Congress must separately debate and vote on the objection.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists see little chance of any impact on the election outcome, but there could be fireworks. Trump has been claiming since the election that there was fraud but multiple courts failed to find any truth to the claims.\n*****\n&gt; Rupkey said investors are not taking into account enough potential for political risk from the deep animosity between the two political parties.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the additional stimulus and hopes for additional stimulus, and infrastructure spending in 2021, I don\u2019t know that that is such a slam dunk, because of the issue of political instability,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/cAXzkxf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/HnhSggu.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/5egoYkS.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/UlNY0Um.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/z4wSKuc.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/32Ma7rG.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mRJqU8A.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/J7B4Njx.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5udYrpD.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JJmAiwp.png))**\n\n# **Thursday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1ARzFfu.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Why A Year-End Rally Bodes Well For 2021\n\n&gt; Welcome to the last day of 2020! It has been a devastating year in so many ways, yet for investors it has been quite rewarding. Much of the gains in 2020 have taken place the final two months, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up more than 14% in November and December so far, the best end to a year since WWII.\n\n&gt; A big end of year rally could have bulls smiling in 2021. \u201cTurns out a 10% or more gain the final two months of the year has equaled a higher S&amp;P 500 the following year every single time since World War II,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIn fact, January was also higher every single time as well, so maybe this strong rally to end the year is a clue for higher prices into next year.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 gained an average of more than 18% the year following a 10% or more surge during the final two months of the year. Meanwhile, January was up 5 for 5 as well, rising an impressive 3% on average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s what the average year looks like after the prior year gains 10% or more the final two months compared to a typical year. Once again, strong returns are the playbook historically.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog-12.31.20-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We wish everyone a happy and safe New Years Eve and we\u2019ll see you in 2021!\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Fifty to Zero in 283 Days\n\n&gt; In a year with some pretty crazy charts, the one below is right up there with some of the best. After all the markets have been through this year, bot the S&amp;P 500 and Long-Term Treasuries have seen nearly identical returns on a total return basis. That's right, with just a few hours left in the trading year, the S&amp;P 500's total return in 2020 has been a gain of 17.6%, while Long Term US Treasuries, as measured by the B of A Merrill Lynch Long-Term Treasury Index has rallied 17.3%. What makes this nearly identical performance all the more incredible is that on March 23rd, the performance gap between the two was more than 50 percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds.png))**\n\n&gt; The fact that stocks and bonds have essentially seen identical returns this year isn't typical. The chart below shows the annual performance spread between the S&amp;P 500 and long-term US Treasuries going back to 1978. During that time, the S&amp;P 500 has historically outperformed long-term US Treasuries by an average of 3.9 percentage points per year, but the average gap in performance between the two has been over 15 percentage points. In the 43 years since 1978, there have only been seven other years where the performance spread between the two asset classes was less than five percentage points and just two years (1985 and 1992) where the performance spread was less than a percentage point.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds-Annual-Spreads.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Back-to-Back Big Years for Technology\n\n&gt; With just two trading days (including today) left in 2020, the S&amp;P 500 Technology sector is on pace for its second year in a row of rallying more than 40%. Going back to 1990, the only time the Technology sector experienced back-to-back returns of more than 40% was in 1998 and 1999. Back then, not only was the Technology sector up 40%+ in back-to-back years, but it was also up over 75% in both of those years. If you think markets are pretty crazy these days, they still have nothing on the last two years of the 1990s!\n\n&gt; In terms of cumulative returns, the Technology sector is up 210% since the last trading day of 2018, whereas in 1999 it was up 317% in a two-year span. What's also interesting to note about the last 31 years of returns for the Technology sector is how it has only experienced five down years, while the S&amp;P 500 has been down in ten different years during that span. Furthermore, since 2009 there has only been one down year and the decline was a paltry 1.6%. Not a bad 12-year run!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Performance.png))**\n\n&gt; Given that the sector has more than doubled in the last two years, there have been some big individual winners. Topping the list with a gain of just under 400% is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). On the last day of 2018, AMD traded hands for under $20 per share. Today's it's over $90. AMD has a lead of more than 100 percentage points over the next closest stock - NVIDIA (NVDA) - which is up 288%. Interestingly, there aren't a lot of major outliers to the upside compared to the sector's 210% gain, but that's because Apple (AAPL), the sector's largest stock, has paced the sector's gains by rallying more than 240%.\n\n&gt; On the downside, just four stocks in the Technology sector have declined in the last two years. The worst of these has been DXC Technology (DXC) which has lost more than half of its value, while Juniper (JNPR) and HP Enterprise (HPE) are down between 10% and 20%. Lastly, FLIR Systems (FLIR) has declined less than 2%, so depending on how it acts in the next two days, it could move into positive territory just as Intel (INTC) did yesterday after Third Point bailed it out and moved the stock barely into positive territory for the last two years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Growth Dragging on Small Caps\n\n&gt; In the past couple of weeks, we have frequently been keeping tabs on small-cap equities which have been particularly strong performers of late resulting in very overbought readings as well as extended valuations. More specifically, taking a look at growth-oriented small-caps, with only a couple days left in the year small-cap growth stocks\u2014proxied by the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO)\u2014are on pace to have outperformed large-cap equivalents in 2020. On December 10th, IWO surpassed the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) in terms of YTD performance, and even after pulling back in the past week, IWO is still in the lead.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large1.png))**\n\n&gt; As a result of recent moves, there has been a sharp reversal on a relative basis between the two ETFs in the past week. In the chart below, we show the ratio of the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) versus the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). This ratio took off beginning in the early fall meaning small-cap growth drastically outperformed large-cap growth. But the former's weakness in the past several days has put a halt to that move.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large2.png))**\n\n&gt; As to just how sharp of a reversal this was, in the five days through yesterday's close, the decline in the ratio of IWO to IVW was the largest since June. Before that, April and March saw declines that were even larger. Not only was this one of the biggest drops in the relative performance of small-cap growth to large-cap growth in the past few months, but that also stands in the bottom 0.5% of all readings going back to 2000 when the ETF first began trading. Outside of this past spring, the only other periods that have also experienced this type of underperformance of small-cap growth relative to large-cap growth was at various points in 2011, 2008, and a handful of times in the early 2000s.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large3.png))**\n\n&gt; Small-cap underperformance has not necessarily been broad though. For value stocks, small caps (IWN) have generally outperformed large caps (IVE) for the entirety of the new bull market. While there was a bit of a turn lower in recent days, it has been nowhere close to as dramatic of a move as growth stocks.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large4.png))**\n\n&gt; In the charts below, we show average performance over the past week of Russell 2000 stocks broken into deciles based on their price to sales and price to book ratios. As shown, the most aggressively valued deciles have averaged the worst performance in the past week. Stocks with low P/S and P/B ratios have not been immune from the weakness, but they have held up significantly better.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-RTY-Decile.png))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/5udYrpD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/hQIRBYI.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.4.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.4.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  1.5.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZAbC0jw.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.5.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wKzyMxp.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.6.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BUFtffd.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.6.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cDQHHqx.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.7.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NhUT413.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.7.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7p03h4M.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.8.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.8.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Micron Technology, Inc. $75.18\n**Micron Technology, Inc.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. Happy New Year! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week, month and year ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 4th, 2021.\n\n# **Politics will be front and center as a catalyst in the first week of the new year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/31/politics-will-be-front-and-center-as-a-catalyst-in-the-first-week-of-the-new-year-.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks exit 2020 with strong gains and are riding a tailwind, but already in the dawn of the new year, the market could face its first big challenge.\n*****\n&gt; The final outcome of the 2020 election plays out Tuesday, when voters in Georgia will pick their senators and decide which party controls the U.S. Senate.\n*****\n&gt; With President-elect Joe Biden heading to the White House and a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, Wall Street has been comfortable with the view that Biden and the Democrats could not succeed with tax hikes and more progressive policy changes while Republicans hold the Senate.\n*****\n&gt; The runoff election for the two Senate seats Tuesday is widely expected to result in one or both of the incumbent Republican senators retaining their seats. But Democrats are close in the polls and should they win, each party would have 50 seats with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the tie breaker.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cGeorgia is the most important thing to the Biden presidency for the next two years,\u201d said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. \u201cIt\u2019s going to determine what is the legislative agenda and who can get confirmed by the United States Senate.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Sen. David Perdue is being challenged by Democrat Jon Ossoff, while GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler is running against Democrat Raphael Warnock. None of the candidates had more than 50% of the vote in the Nov. 3 election, so Georgia law requires a runoff election between the two leading candidates for each seat.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s a binary event,\u201d said Mills, adding it\u2019s of growing interest to markets. \u201cThe general sense for the market is that Republicans are well positioned to maintain their majority in the Senate. But I think the 2020 election as well as the 2016 election and to some extent, the 2018 election has humbled us \u2026 The Senate outcomes, in particular, seem to be less predictable than almost any other elections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Mills said the results may take several days to determine, adding to the uncertainty the event could hold for markets. According to an RBC investor survey, 88% expect Republicans to maintain control, and most say that is a positive for the stock market.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market tends to shoot first and ask questions later. There will certainly be a reaction if Democrats win both those seats,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. Strategists say there could be a relief rally if Republican incumbents see a clear victory.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat totally dominates [trading] because it\u2019s about do we have status quo or do we have Democrats controlling all parts of Washington and what that means for spending and taxes,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI think you could see the worries about taxes overwhelming any thoughts on the benefits of more spending\u201d by Democrats.\n*****\n&gt; # By the numbers\n&gt; A year of extreme volatility ended with a big win for stocks, as the pandemic steered the course for markets. The S&amp;P 500 was up 16.3% for the year, ending at 3,756. That gain comes after a 34% decline early in the year, followed by a powerful more-than 65% rebound. Technology was the big winner for the year, and the Nasdaq was up 43.6% at 12,888.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the runoff vote, the market will be watching a stream of data in the coming week, including the important December jobs report Friday. That could show fewer than 100,000 jobs were added as the spreading virus impacted hiring and layoffs. There were 245,000 jobs created in November.\n*****\n&gt; There is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday, and a number of Fed speakers, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; The virus itself could also be a factor for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; Conventional wisdom for the coming year has been that vaccines will be widely distributed, and by the second half things will start to get back to normal and the economy will pick up. But the initial distribution has been slow, and far short of the 20 million targeted for December by President Donald Trump\u2019s task force.\n*****\n&gt; In that recent RBC survey, three quarters of investors were optimistic about vaccine distribution with 80% expecting a majority to be vaccinated by the end of 2021. \u201cWe suspect that the positive outlook for the stock market and the economy would deteriorate if expectations for a smooth vaccine rollout are not met,\u201d RBC strategists wrote.\n*****\n&gt; They also noted that nearly 60% of the investors surveyed believe high stock market valuations are problematic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis suggests to us that any threat to the economic and earnings recovery story could spark profit-taking. On this point, it is worth noting that the vaccine was the No. 1 issue keeping investors up at night, closely followed by monetary policy and excessive optimism on the recovery,\u201d the strategists noted.\n*****\n&gt; Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, said investors will also be watching the formal acceptance of the Electoral College vote Wednesday. Strategists expect the vote count to confirm Biden\u2019s presidency.\n*****\n&gt; However, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley says he will challenge the certification, and several House Republicans have already vowed to contest the election at that time. If one House member and a senator jointly object to a state\u2019s slate of electors, the two houses of Congress must separately debate and vote on the objection.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists see little chance of any impact on the election outcome, but there could be fireworks. Trump has been claiming since the election that there was fraud but multiple courts failed to find any truth to the claims.\n*****\n&gt; Rupkey said investors are not taking into account enough potential for political risk from the deep animosity between the two political parties.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the additional stimulus and hopes for additional stimulus, and infrastructure spending in 2021, I don\u2019t know that that is such a slam dunk, because of the issue of political instability,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/cAXzkxf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/HnhSggu.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/5egoYkS.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/UlNY0Um.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/z4wSKuc.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/32Ma7rG.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mRJqU8A.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/J7B4Njx.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5udYrpD.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JJmAiwp.png))**\n\n# **Thursday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1ARzFfu.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Why A Year-End Rally Bodes Well For 2021\n\n&gt; Welcome to the last day of 2020! It has been a devastating year in so many ways, yet for investors it has been quite rewarding. Much of the gains in 2020 have taken place the final two months, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up more than 14% in November and December so far, the best end to a year since WWII.\n\n&gt; A big end of year rally could have bulls smiling in 2021. \u201cTurns out a 10% or more gain the final two months of the year has equaled a higher S&amp;P 500 the following year every single time since World War II,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIn fact, January was also higher every single time as well, so maybe this strong rally to end the year is a clue for higher prices into next year.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 gained an average of more than 18% the year following a 10% or more surge during the final two months of the year. Meanwhile, January was up 5 for 5 as well, rising an impressive 3% on average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s what the average year looks like after the prior year gains 10% or more the final two months compared to a typical year. Once again, strong returns are the playbook historically.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog-12.31.20-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We wish everyone a happy and safe New Years Eve and we\u2019ll see you in 2021!\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Fifty to Zero in 283 Days\n\n&gt; In a year with some pretty crazy charts, the one below is right up there with some of the best. After all the markets have been through this year, bot the S&amp;P 500 and Long-Term Treasuries have seen nearly identical returns on a total return basis. That's right, with just a few hours left in the trading year, the S&amp;P 500's total return in 2020 has been a gain of 17.6%, while Long Term US Treasuries, as measured by the B of A Merrill Lynch Long-Term Treasury Index has rallied 17.3%. What makes this nearly identical performance all the more incredible is that on March 23rd, the performance gap between the two was more than 50 percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds.png))**\n\n&gt; The fact that stocks and bonds have essentially seen identical returns this year isn't typical. The chart below shows the annual performance spread between the S&amp;P 500 and long-term US Treasuries going back to 1978. During that time, the S&amp;P 500 has historically outperformed long-term US Treasuries by an average of 3.9 percentage points per year, but the average gap in performance between the two has been over 15 percentage points. In the 43 years since 1978, there have only been seven other years where the performance spread between the two asset classes was less than five percentage points and just two years (1985 and 1992) where the performance spread was less than a percentage point.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds-Annual-Spreads.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Back-to-Back Big Years for Technology\n\n&gt; With just two trading days (including today) left in 2020, the S&amp;P 500 Technology sector is on pace for its second year in a row of rallying more than 40%. Going back to 1990, the only time the Technology sector experienced back-to-back returns of more than 40% was in 1998 and 1999. Back then, not only was the Technology sector up 40%+ in back-to-back years, but it was also up over 75% in both of those years. If you think markets are pretty crazy these days, they still have nothing on the last two years of the 1990s!\n\n&gt; In terms of cumulative returns, the Technology sector is up 210% since the last trading day of 2018, whereas in 1999 it was up 317% in a two-year span. What's also interesting to note about the last 31 years of returns for the Technology sector is how it has only experienced five down years, while the S&amp;P 500 has been down in ten different years during that span. Furthermore, since 2009 there has only been one down year and the decline was a paltry 1.6%. Not a bad 12-year run!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Performance.png))**\n\n&gt; Given that the sector has more than doubled in the last two years, there have been some big individual winners. Topping the list with a gain of just under 400% is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). On the last day of 2018, AMD traded hands for under $20 per share. Today's it's over $90. AMD has a lead of more than 100 percentage points over the next closest stock - NVIDIA (NVDA) - which is up 288%. Interestingly, there aren't a lot of major outliers to the upside compared to the sector's 210% gain, but that's because Apple (AAPL), the sector's largest stock, has paced the sector's gains by rallying more than 240%.\n\n&gt; On the downside, just four stocks in the Technology sector have declined in the last two years. The worst of these has been DXC Technology (DXC) which has lost more than half of its value, while Juniper (JNPR) and HP Enterprise (HPE) are down between 10% and 20%. Lastly, FLIR Systems (FLIR) has declined less than 2%, so depending on how it acts in the next two days, it could move into positive territory just as Intel (INTC) did yesterday after Third Point bailed it out and moved the stock barely into positive territory for the last two years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Growth Dragging on Small Caps\n\n&gt; In the past couple of weeks, we have frequently been keeping tabs on small-cap equities which have been particularly strong performers of late resulting in very overbought readings as well as extended valuations. More specifically, taking a look at growth-oriented small-caps, with only a couple days left in the year small-cap growth stocks\u2014proxied by the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO)\u2014are on pace to have outperformed large-cap equivalents in 2020. On December 10th, IWO surpassed the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) in terms of YTD performance, and even after pulling back in the past week, IWO is still in the lead.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large1.png))**\n\n&gt; As a result of recent moves, there has been a sharp reversal on a relative basis between the two ETFs in the past week. In the chart below, we show the ratio of the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) versus the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). This ratio took off beginning in the early fall meaning small-cap growth drastically outperformed large-cap growth. But the former's weakness in the past several days has put a halt to that move.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large2.png))**\n\n&gt; As to just how sharp of a reversal this was, in the five days through yesterday's close, the decline in the ratio of IWO to IVW was the largest since June. Before that, April and March saw declines that were even larger. Not only was this one of the biggest drops in the relative performance of small-cap growth to large-cap growth in the past few months, but that also stands in the bottom 0.5% of all readings going back to 2000 when the ETF first began trading. Outside of this past spring, the only other periods that have also experienced this type of underperformance of small-cap growth relative to large-cap growth was at various points in 2011, 2008, and a handful of times in the early 2000s.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large3.png))**\n\n&gt; Small-cap underperformance has not necessarily been broad though. For value stocks, small caps (IWN) have generally outperformed large caps (IVE) for the entirety of the new bull market.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. Happy New Year! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week, month and year ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 4th, 2021.\n\n# **Politics will be front and center as a catalyst in the first week of the new year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/31/politics-will-be-front-and-center-as-a-catalyst-in-the-first-week-of-the-new-year-.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks exit 2020 with strong gains and are riding a tailwind, but already in the dawn of the new year, the market could face its first big challenge.\n*****\n&gt; The final outcome of the 2020 election plays out Tuesday, when voters in Georgia will pick their senators and decide which party controls the U.S. Senate.\n*****\n&gt; With President-elect Joe Biden heading to the White House and a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, Wall Street has been comfortable with the view that Biden and the Democrats could not succeed with tax hikes and more progressive policy changes while Republicans hold the Senate.\n*****\n&gt; The runoff election for the two Senate seats Tuesday is widely expected to result in one or both of the incumbent Republican senators retaining their seats. But Democrats are close in the polls and should they win, each party would have 50 seats with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the tie breaker.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cGeorgia is the most important thing to the Biden presidency for the next two years,\u201d said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. \u201cIt\u2019s going to determine what is the legislative agenda and who can get confirmed by the United States Senate.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Sen. David Perdue is being challenged by Democrat Jon Ossoff, while GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler is running against Democrat Raphael Warnock. None of the candidates had more than 50% of the vote in the Nov. 3 election, so Georgia law requires a runoff election between the two leading candidates for each seat.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s a binary event,\u201d said Mills, adding it\u2019s of growing interest to markets. \u201cThe general sense for the market is that Republicans are well positioned to maintain their majority in the Senate. But I think the 2020 election as well as the 2016 election and to some extent, the 2018 election has humbled us \u2026 The Senate outcomes, in particular, seem to be less predictable than almost any other elections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Mills said the results may take several days to determine, adding to the uncertainty the event could hold for markets. According to an RBC investor survey, 88% expect Republicans to maintain control, and most say that is a positive for the stock market.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market tends to shoot first and ask questions later. There will certainly be a reaction if Democrats win both those seats,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. Strategists say there could be a relief rally if Republican incumbents see a clear victory.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat totally dominates [trading] because it\u2019s about do we have status quo or do we have Democrats controlling all parts of Washington and what that means for spending and taxes,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI think you could see the worries about taxes overwhelming any thoughts on the benefits of more spending\u201d by Democrats.\n*****\n&gt; # By the numbers\n&gt; A year of extreme volatility ended with a big win for stocks, as the pandemic steered the course for markets. The S&amp;P 500 was up 16.3% for the year, ending at 3,756. That gain comes after a 34% decline early in the year, followed by a powerful more-than 65% rebound. Technology was the big winner for the year, and the Nasdaq was up 43.6% at 12,888.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the runoff vote, the market will be watching a stream of data in the coming week, including the important December jobs report Friday. That could show fewer than 100,000 jobs were added as the spreading virus impacted hiring and layoffs. There were 245,000 jobs created in November.\n*****\n&gt; There is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday, and a number of Fed speakers, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; The virus itself could also be a factor for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; Conventional wisdom for the coming year has been that vaccines will be widely distributed, and by the second half things will start to get back to normal and the economy will pick up. But the initial distribution has been slow, and far short of the 20 million targeted for December by President Donald Trump\u2019s task force.\n*****\n&gt; In that recent RBC survey, three quarters of investors were optimistic about vaccine distribution with 80% expecting a majority to be vaccinated by the end of 2021. \u201cWe suspect that the positive outlook for the stock market and the economy would deteriorate if expectations for a smooth vaccine rollout are not met,\u201d RBC strategists wrote.\n*****\n&gt; They also noted that nearly 60% of the investors surveyed believe high stock market valuations are problematic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis suggests to us that any threat to the economic and earnings recovery story could spark profit-taking. On this point, it is worth noting that the vaccine was the No. 1 issue keeping investors up at night, closely followed by monetary policy and excessive optimism on the recovery,\u201d the strategists noted.\n*****\n&gt; Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, said investors will also be watching the formal acceptance of the Electoral College vote Wednesday. Strategists expect the vote count to confirm Biden\u2019s presidency.\n*****\n&gt; However, Missouri Sen.

It has been a devastating year in so many ways, yet for investors it has been quite rewarding. Much of the gains in 2020 have taken place the final two months, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up more than 14% in November and December so far, the best end to a year since WWII.\n\n&gt; A big end of year rally could have bulls smiling in 2021. \u201cTurns out a 10% or more gain the final two months of the year has equaled a higher S&amp;P 500 the following year every single time since World War II,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIn fact, January was also higher every single time as well, so maybe this strong rally to end the year is a clue for higher prices into next year.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 gained an average of more than 18% the year following a 10% or more surge during the final two months of the year. Meanwhile, January was up 5 for 5 as well, rising an impressive 3% on average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s what the average year looks like after the prior year gains 10% or more the final two months compared to a typical year. Once again, strong returns are the playbook historically.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog-12.31.20-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We wish everyone a happy and safe New Years Eve and we\u2019ll see you in 2021!\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Fifty to Zero in 283 Days\n\n&gt; In a year with some pretty crazy charts, the one below is right up there with some of the best. After all the markets have been through this year, bot the S&amp;P 500 and Long-Term Treasuries have seen nearly identical returns on a total return basis. That's right, with just a few hours left in the trading year, the S&amp;P 500's total return in 2020 has been a gain of 17.6%, while Long Term US Treasuries, as measured by the B of A Merrill Lynch Long-Term Treasury Index has rallied 17.3%. What makes this nearly identical performance all the more incredible is that on March 23rd, the performance gap between the two was more than 50 percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds.png))**\n\n&gt; The fact that stocks and bonds have essentially seen identical returns this year isn't typical. The chart below shows the annual performance spread between the S&amp;P 500 and long-term US Treasuries going back to 1978. During that time, the S&amp;P 500 has historically outperformed long-term US Treasuries by an average of 3.9 percentage points per year, but the average gap in performance between the two has been over 15 percentage points. In the 43 years since 1978, there have only been seven other years where the performance spread between the two asset classes was less than five percentage points and just two years (1985 and 1992) where the performance spread was less than a percentage point.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds-Annual-Spreads.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Back-to-Back Big Years for Technology\n\n&gt; With just two trading days (including today) left in 2020, the S&amp;P 500 Technology sector is on pace for its second year in a row of rallying more than 40%. Going back to 1990, the only time the Technology sector experienced back-to-back returns of more than 40% was in 1998 and 1999. Back then, not only was the Technology sector up 40%+ in back-to-back years, but it was also up over 75% in both of those years. If you think markets are pretty crazy these days, they still have nothing on the last two years of the 1990s!\n\n&gt; In terms of cumulative returns, the Technology sector is up 210% since the last trading day of 2018, whereas in 1999 it was up 317% in a two-year span. What's also interesting to note about the last 31 years of returns for the Technology sector is how it has only experienced five down years, while the S&amp;P 500 has been down in ten different years during that span. Furthermore, since 2009 there has only been one down year and the decline was a paltry 1.6%. Not a bad 12-year run!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Performance.png))**\n\n&gt; Given that the sector has more than doubled in the last two years, there have been some big individual winners. Topping the list with a gain of just under 400% is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). On the last day of 2018, AMD traded hands for under $20 per share. Today's it's over $90. AMD has a lead of more than 100 percentage points over the next closest stock - NVIDIA (NVDA) - which is up 288%. Interestingly, there aren't a lot of major outliers to the upside compared to the sector's 210% gain, but that's because Apple (AAPL), the sector's largest stock, has paced the sector's gains by rallying more than 240%.\n\n&gt; On the downside, just four stocks in the Technology sector have declined in the last two years. The worst of these has been DXC Technology (DXC) which has lost more than half of its value, while Juniper (JNPR) and HP Enterprise (HPE) are down between 10% and 20%. Lastly, FLIR Systems (FLIR) has declined less than 2%, so depending on how it acts in the next two days, it could move into positive territory just as Intel (INTC) did yesterday after Third Point bailed it out and moved the stock barely into positive territory for the last two years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Growth Dragging on Small Caps\n\n&gt; In the past couple of weeks, we have frequently been keeping tabs on small-cap equities which have been particularly strong performers of late resulting in very overbought readings as well as extended valuations. More specifically, taking a look at growth-oriented small-caps, with only a couple days left in the year small-cap growth stocks\u2014proxied by the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO)\u2014are on pace to have outperformed large-cap equivalents in 2020. On December 10th, IWO surpassed the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) in terms of YTD performance, and even after pulling back in the past week, IWO is still in the lead.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large1.png))**\n\n&gt; As a result of recent moves, there has been a sharp reversal on a relative basis between the two ETFs in the past week. In the chart below, we show the ratio of the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) versus the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). This ratio took off beginning in the early fall meaning small-cap growth drastically outperformed large-cap growth. But the former's weakness in the past several days has put a halt to that move.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large2.png))**\n\n&gt; As to just how sharp of a reversal this was, in the five days through yesterday's close, the decline in the ratio of IWO to IVW was the largest since June. Before that, April and March saw declines that were even larger. Not only was this one of the biggest drops in the relative performance of small-cap growth to large-cap growth in the past few months, but that also stands in the bottom 0.5% of all readings going back to 2000 when the ETF first began trading. Outside of this past spring, the only other periods that have also experienced this type of underperformance of small-cap growth relative to large-cap growth was at various points in 2011, 2008, and a handful of times in the early 2000s.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large3.png))**\n\n&gt; Small-cap underperformance has not necessarily been broad though. For value stocks, small caps (IWN) have generally outperformed large caps (IVE) for the entirety of the new bull market. While there was a bit of a turn lower in recent days, it has been nowhere close to as dramatic of a move as growth stocks.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large4.png))**\n\n&gt; In the charts below, we show average performance over the past week of Russell 2000 stocks broken into deciles based on their price to sales and price to book ratios. As shown, the most aggressively valued deciles have averaged the worst performance in the past week. Stocks with low P/S and P/B ratios have not been immune from the weakness, but they have held up significantly better.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-RTY-Decile.png))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/5udYrpD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/hQIRBYI.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.4.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.4.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  1.5.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZAbC0jw.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.5.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wKzyMxp.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.6.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BUFtffd.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.6.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cDQHHqx.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.7.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NhUT413.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.7.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7p03h4M.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.8.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.8.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Micron Technology, Inc. $75.18\n**Micron Technology, Inc.

Meanwhile Katapult only popped 18% because not many people know of it yet since it is still a SPAC.\n\nKatapult is very similar to Affirm: they both allow their users to buy items over time in monthly or weekly payments. Katapult is growing at a 75% CAGR and is currently trading at **3x its estimated 2021 revenue** which is ridiculously cheap. Affirm for comparison is growing at roughly 90% which is more than Katapult, but 15% doesn\u2019t warrant Katapult\u2019s valuation to be nearly 6 times cheaper than Affirm (in proportion to revenue).\n\n**Katapult\u2019s valuation: 6x 2020 revenues**\n\n**Affirm\u2019s valuation: 34x 2020 revenues**\n\nMy price target: $30-$35 by merger.

        "selftext": " **TL:DR is at the bottom**\n\nHello, welcome to my second deep dive write up.\n\nMy   name\u2019s Mark and I\u2019m an accountant with a passion for investing. About   two years ago, I used to work as an auditor at a public accounting firm   and have been behind the scenes at many different publicly traded and   privately held companies in the U.S. My goal is to bring my unique   perspective from that past experience, my current experience working in a   new role at a large corporation, and my understanding of accounting to   help break down some of the most exciting growth stocks on the market   today.\n\nI\u2019m a long-term investor. I   am focused on finding great companies and holding them for a long  time.  I\u2019m willing to endure volatility, crazy price drops, and  everything  that comes with this approach as long as the facts that led  me to  originally invest and believe in that company have not changed.  If you  want to learn more about this approach. I recommend reading the  book  \u201c100 Baggers\u201d by Chris Mayer.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nI\u2019m   excited to share with you all my stock pick for this month,  Smartsheet.  I\u2019m always looking for investment ideas. I run stock  screeners with  different criteria (mostly focused on revenue growth),  scan Twitter,  talk to professionals in different industries, and try to  observe what  products or services are getting popular with my friends  and family. One  of the best investment decisions I\u2019ve made to date came  after I talked  to my friend about a drink he was drinking on the golf  course. Shout out  to you Celsius (CELH)! With that being said, you  never know where your  next good investment idea is going to come from.\n\nIn   the case of Smartsheet, I became aware of the company through a stock   screener. I was drawn to the relatively small market cap ($8.6B),  strong  revenue growth (roughly 35%), and the fact that it\u2019s a  subscription  business model (SaaS). Once I became aware of these facts,  it cued me to  take a deeper dive. The more I learned about Smartsheet,  the more I  liked. Management talks a lot about empowering people and  that really  struck a chord with me. In different roles I\u2019ve had as a  teacher, tutor,  and supervisor, I\u2019ve always found empowering people to  be one of the  most important keys to success. I will touch on this more  later in the  write up.\n\nAnother  positive signal I  got about Smartsheet came unexpectedly one evening. I  was sitting in  the kitchen and my girlfriend was cooking dinner. I was  watching an  interview on my phone with Mark Mader, the CEO of  Smartsheet. My  girlfriend overheard the word \u201cSmartsheet\u201d mentioned in  the video and  said \u201cAre they talking about the Smartsheet with the blue  check mark?\u201d. I  had to Google their logo but yes, it turns out we were  thinking about  the same Smartsheet. I asked her how she knew about it.  She said \u201cMy  company just transitioned all of our work onto  Smartsheet. I really love  it. Our marketing department is really  excited about it because it  makes their job way easier and more  enjoyable.\u201d Hearing this just  motivated me to learn more about  Smartsheet.\n\n**The Thesis Statement**\n\nFor   every stock pick I make, I want to provide a quick thesis statement   that can serve as a reminder for why I\u2019m buying and holding that stock   for the long term. I\u2019ll always aim to make it just a few sentences long   so it can easily be remembered and internalized. This helps during  times  when the price may sporadically drop and you need to remember why   you\u2019re holding this position.\n\nThe thesis statement I have come up with for Smartsheet is as follows:\n\n*\u201cSmartsheet:   A leader in collaborative work management (CWM) software. As the  global  workforce becomes more decentralized through remote work,  managers and  executives now more than ever need a tool to digitally  consolidate their  teams, projects and deadlines. Smartsheet is that  tool and is  innovating to offer businesses even more ways to get the  most out of  their teams.\u201d*\n\nI  think this  thesis statement really captures the essence of what  Smartsheet does. If  you go to Smartsheet\u2019s website and look at the  \u201cAbout\u201d page, you will  find their \u201cAbout\u201d statement which says  \u201cSmartsheet is the enterprise  platform for dynamic work that aligns  people and technology so your  entire business can move faster, drive  innovation, and achieve more.\u201d  Notice how their statement emphasizes  helping businesses move faster,  drive innovation, and achieve more.\n\nIn   my thesis statement, I mention that Smartsheet is a leader in the CWM   software space. But how do I know this? Well, a highly reputable   independent research firm named Forrester conducted a study on the CWM   space based off different criteria including collaboration, enterprise   capabilities, UI/user experience, planned enhancements and number of   customers just to name a few of the factors considered. I put the   companies that were identified from the study in the order of their   ranking below. As you can see, Smartsheet is firmly planted as a leader   in the space at 2nd place. Let\u2019s use our common sense for a second. At   the beginning stages of a remote work revolution, do we want to invest   in an up and coming SaaS company that focuses on providing firms with   resources to digitally manage their teams, digitally manage   work/projects, and digitally collaborate to get work done? I think the   answer should be a resounding yes. But what about these other companies   on the list. Let\u2019s break them down 1 by 1:\n\n* Workfront   was recently bought by Adobe. If you want to invest in Workfront,  you\u2019d  have to invest in the much larger company of Adobe. It wouldn\u2019t  be a  pure play investment into the CWM space.\n* Smartsheet is 2nd and of course, they are public :)\n* Wrike is private\n* ServiceNow   \u2013 CWM is just one small piece of their total      offerings. Investing   here would not be a pure play into the CWM space.  Also, the company  is  already quite large ($106B market cap)\n* Asana   is public but just IPO\u2019d on 9/30/20 about 3 months ago. We don\u2019t have   much data to track their performance as a      publicly traded company.   Furthermore, although they actually would be a pure play investment  into  the CWM space, they\u2019re not a leader and rank behind Smartsheet in   several of Forrester\u2019s categories. Why invest in the 2nd best when you   can invest in the best?\n* Monday.com is private\n* Microsoft \u2013 CWM is just one small piece of their total offerings. Investing here would not be a pure play into the CWM space.\n* Atlassian   \u2013 This company does primarily focus on CWM but I have a couple  problems  with them as an investment. 1) They\u2019re ranked way beneath  Smartsheet.  2) They\u2019re already too big for me to confidently say they  can 10x  (market cap already $58B).\n\nNow   that we\u2019ve established that Smartsheet is a leader in the CWM space  and  that they\u2019re arguably the best publicly available pure-play  investment  in this space let\u2019s understand why this is important. Other  than the  obvious reason that we\u2019re in the beginning stages of a remote  work  revolution, why is this important?\n\nWell,   let\u2019s take a look at this quote from Mark Mader, Smartsheet CEO,  during  the last earnings call (Q3 FY21) that occurred on December 7th,  2020:\n\n\u201cLeaders  are recognizing  they need to shift more workloads to asynchronous work,  work that is  documented, automated, tracked with dashboards, and where  priorities  are clearly defined. They understand that by empowering their  teams  with no-code solutions that facilitate asynchronous work, cycle  times  will be improved, a deeper sense of ownership will be created, and   prioritization and accountability will be insured. Smartsheet is   ideally suited to help enterprises work more asynchronously to derive   the benefits from doing so.\u201d\n\nKey word here: Asynchronous. Asynchronous communication is different from Synchronous communication. Here is the difference:\n\nAsynchronous: email, message boards, dashboards, etc.\n\nSynchronous: video conferencing, chat, audio calls, etc.\n\nAny   communication that doesn\u2019t require a real-time response can be   considered asynchronous, like the examples in the picture above.   Synchronous communication is any communication that happens in real   time, thereby allowing for immediate responses, see examples above. As   part of my research on Smartsheet, I read an E-Book that was written by   the original co-founders of Smartsheet, Mark Mader the current CEO and   Brent Frei who is no longer with the company. They wrote the E-Book in   2007 just a couple of years after the 2005 founding. The E-Book is   called \u201cThe Power of Done\u201d. The moral of the book is that Mark and Brent   noticed through their own experience, and through different research   studies on work place productivity, that the rise in technology in the   early 21st century was actually making employees less productive. This   is a quote from their E-Book:\n\n\u201cAccording   to Basex, a research firm focusing on the knowledge economy,   interruptions from email, cell phones, instant messaging, text messaging   and blogs eat up nearly 30 percent of each day; on an annualized  basis,  this represents a loss of 28 billion hours for the entire U.S.   workforce, or a $588 billion cost to the American economy.\u201d\n\nThey   mention in their book that although there has been a lot of advances  in  work technology such as email, word processing, and spreadsheets,  there  hadn\u2019t at that time been any great applications created for  teamwork  collaboration or task management. The fact that technology  advances  helped the world create tools to enhance productivity but also  deterred  productivity at the same time is what Mark and Brent referred  to as the  productivity paradox. They wanted to do something about it  and thus they  founded Smartsheet.\n\n**How Smartsheet makes money**\n\nAt   the very least, before you invest in a company, you better understand   how they make money. In Chris Mayers\u2019 excellent book, 100 Baggers, that  I  mentioned above, he continually references top line revenue growth  as  one of the main common indicators of a possible 100 Bagger. This  isn\u2019t  to tell you that any stock I pick will be a 100 Bagger just  because it  has great top line revenue growth, but if I am looking at a  growth stock  to hold for the long term, revenue growth is one of the  first things I  look at.\n\nBefore I  talk about the  revenue streams of Smartsheet, I want to share a little  bit about the  actual product that they sell to earn this revenue.  Co-Founder/CEO Mark  Mader realized that a lot of work in the corporate  world was being done  on spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel. However,  he realized that these  spreadsheets were largely static and not  necessarily used to their full  potential. He wanted to help people get  more out of their use of  spreadsheets. As a result, we now have  Smartsheets which is a cloud  based platform that can be accessed by all  employees of the company no  matter where they are with live  information about project statuses,  meeting times and work that is  assigned to each employee just to name a  few uses. Users can choose  their way of viewing this information with  different views such as  calendar view, grid view, card view, and Gantt  view.\n\nThe  idea is that by  enhancing the availability and quality of asynchronous  information  available to all members of a team about the status of a  project, the  tasks assigned, and the timelines, the less synchronous  communication  will be needed which allows employees to spend more time  doing what  they\u2019re hired to do \u2013 get work done. Think about how  wasteful it is to  hire a highly talented engineer but then make him  spend half his day  preparing for and doing status update meetings and  hunting people down  to see where they\u2019re at with their assignments.  What if all this  information was available for him, his managers, and  his staff to see  within Smartsheet without having to bother each other  and waste precious  work hours that could be used for coding, designing,  and producing?  That\u2019s what Smartsheet looks to achieve.\n\nFor   Smartsheet, their means of making money is quite simple. As I  mentioned  earlier, they are a Software as a Service (SaaS) company.  Whenever you  see SaaS, that means subscription revenue and in my  opinion that\u2019s a  very good thing. With a subscription business model,  the revenue is  going to be recurring every year and that type of  reliability (combined  with growth of course) is something you want as  an investor.\n\nSmartsheet\u2019s  primary  source of revenue is the sale of subscriptions to their  cloud-based  Collaborative Work Management (CWM) platform. Customers and  potential  customers begin their engagement with the Smartsheet platform  by either  signing up for a free trial, purchasing a subscription on the   Smartsheet website, going through a sales rep, or they are exposed to   Smartsheet by collaborating with a Company/Individual that uses   Smartsheet.  For subscriptions, customers select the plan that meets   their needs and can begin using Smartsheet within minutes.\n\nSmartsheet   offers four subscription levels: Individual, Business, Enterprise, and   Premier, the pricing for which varies by the capabilities provided.   Customers can also purchase connectors, which provide data integration   and automation to third-party applications.\n\nThe   Connectors part of the business is something I find really  interesting.  Basically, Smartsheet has made deals with most of the top  work  productivity and communication software companies in the world to  allow  their customers to use those applications within their Smartsheet  user  interface. This helps position Smartsheet as the true \u201ccommand  center\u201d  platform while the products of the other companies become  ancillary  pieces. You\u2019ll see this on the link above but some products  that  Smartsheet sells Connectors for include Adobe Creative Cloud,  Microsoft  Dynamics 365, Salesforce, Jira Software, Slack, and Skype  just to name a  few.\n\nI think that  being able to  sell these Connectors as ancillary pieces to the  Smartsheet user  experience is so beneficial to Smartsheet because a lot  of these  companies that people may perceive as \u201cSmartsheet  competitors\u201d actually  become a piece of the Smartsheet platform and can  be sold by Smartsheet  as a supplemental revenue stream. This neutral  angle that Smartsheet is  able to come from by selling Connectors to  their perceived \u201ccompetitors\u201d  reminds me a little bit of how Roku  (ROKU) is able to earn revenue off  of selling a Netflix subscription on  their platform. I think just the  fact that all these big companies  like Adobe, Jira, Salesforce, etc.  allow their products to be  integrated into Smartsheet shows that there  is a high value proposition  in the Smartsheet platform and that they  would risk alienating their  customers if they didn\u2019t allow for their  products to be integrated with  Smartsheet.\n\nOn  top of the  Connectors to third party vendors that Smartsheet is able to  sell,  Smartsheet is also able to sell upgrades to their own internal   plug-ins. Smartsheet has some impressive proprietary plug-ins they can   sell to their customers. For example, in May 2019, Smartsheet acquired   10,000ft which augmented their product portfolio by providing resource   allocation and planning. The name \u201c10,000ft\u201d is meant to be analogous to   having a high level view of your company and all resources available   within your company and how to deploy them.\n\nAlso,   in September 2020, Smartsheet acquired Brandfolder, Inc. which  provides  a centralized platform to organize, discover, control,  distribute, and  measure all forms of digital content. Combining  Brandfolder capabilities  with Smartsheet allows them to create dynamic  solutions that manage  workflows around content and collaboration. This  goes back to what I  said earlier in the article about how my girlfriend  had mentioned that  her company\u2019s marketing team was \u201creally excited  about Smartsheet  because it makes their job way easier and more  enjoyable.\u201d She told me  that before Smartsheet, her company\u2019s marketing  team had to constantly  hunt down members of the creative team  (photographers, graphic  designers) to receive the latest photos,  videos, and digital designs  they were working on. She said it was a big  pain for them trying to  share this content over email and SharePoint.  Now, all of the content is  inside of Smartsheet and the marketing team  can access it at any time.  They can leave comments on the content,  route to appropriate individuals  for approvals, and have better insight  into the status of all digital  content that is being worked on. The  acquisition of Brandfolder is  really what allows Smartsheet to stand  out in this department.\n\nNobody   really talks about it, but digital content is so important these days   for companies in terms of controlling their brand image, putting out   quality advertisements, and presenting their product in as positive of a   light as possible. The fact that Smartsheet has a strong proprietary   plug-in for this with Brandfolder is very promising. During Smartsheet\u2019s   FY21 Engage Customer Conference, Anna Griffin, Smartsheet Chief   Marketing Officer said that the global annual marketing spend is $500B   for companies around the world. She said the role of the marketing   department is changing from sole content creator to Editor in Chief. All   kinds of teams within companies these days are putting out content  that  effects the company\u2019s brand. Sales is running social media  campaigns,  product marketing is putting out blog posts and podcasts,  and R&amp;D is  teasing new product experiences in app. It can get  really difficult for  the company\u2019s Marketing/Branding team to stay on  top of all this  without a centralized digital content collaboration  platform like  Brandfolder in Smartsheet. This is just one reason why I  think  Smartsheet has a lot of growth opportunities in the future.\n\nAs   you can see, Smartsheet has a lot to offer to companies with their  core  CWM platform, the Connectors they can sell, and the internal  upgrades  available such as 10,000ft and Brandfolder. On top of that,  Smartsheet  also provides WorkApps, a proprietary no-code platform that  empowers  users to build intuitive web and mobile applications that  streamline  business and simplify collaboration. There are so many  instances within  companies where an app needs to be built to streamline  a workflow.  Traditionally, companies need to engage their IT  departments and the  coders that sit within these departments to build  these apps. This  places a lot of strain on IT departments and takes  away time they can be  spending on more complex/mission critical  projects. Mark Mader is aware  of this and thus is heavily pushing  no-code as a solution for companies  now and in the future. He believes  that everyday non-coder employees  know their jobs/workflows best and  thus if you empower them to build  their own apps with a no-code  platform they will produce better and more  relevant apps to help get  work done than an IT department employee who  doesn\u2019t even do the job  that the app is being built for. Also, he  believes this will reduce  strain on IT departments and allow them to  focus on more complex and  mission critical projects.\n\nHere   is a quote from the Director of Sales (Hina Patel) at a Smartsheet   customer, Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO): \u201cI have been waiting for a solution like   WorkApps that can give us quick and easy access to the content we  need,  when and where we need it,\u201d said Hina Patel, Director of Sales   Operations at Cisco. \u201cThe ability to take our Smartsheet assets, along   with other tools we use, and package an entire solution in an intuitive   app will make it even easier to drive active participation from  everyone  involved in the process, no matter their role.\u201d As you can  see, the  value proposition of WorkApps and the Smartsheet platform  appears to be  high.\n\nLastly,  Smartsheet also  generates revenue from Professional Services which is  essentially  providing training and customized consulting to Smartsheet  customers  that want to get more out of the Smartsheet platform. In the  most recent  quarter, Q3 FY21, Professional Services accounted for 8.2%  of revenue.  Here is the breakout from the most recent quarter:\n\nSubscription revenue = $90,890M for 91.8% of total revenue\n\nProfessional services revenue = $8,043M for 8.2% of total revenue\n\nThis   is the end of my first article about Smartsheet. My goal is to drop   Part 2 within the next week. The focus of Part 2 will be an in depth   answer of the question \u2013 \u201cCan we 10x from here?\u201d\n\n**TL:DR**\n\n* This is Part 1 of my two part deep dive on Smartsheet (Ticker: SMAR).\n* This first part introduces you to (1) me, (2) the company, (3) my thesis on the company, and (4) digs into how they make money.\n* Part  2 (to be released later this week) will go in depth to explore the  question \u201cCan we 10x from here?\u201d\n* Smartsheet is an exciting SaaS company that\u2019s helping businesses be more productive and get the most out of their people\n* I   am not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice. These  are  just my opinions to help facilitate learning and discussion.\n\n**Disclosure:**   I have no position in Smartsheet. I do plan to initiate a long  position  when the markets open again in 2021.  I wrote this article  myself, and  it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving  compensation for it.

        "selftext": "**TL:DR is at the bottom**\n\nHello, welcome to my second deep dive write up.\n\nMy name\u2019s Mark and I\u2019m an accountant with a passion for investing. About two years ago, I used to work as an auditor at a public accounting firm and have been behind the scenes at many different publicly traded and privately held companies in the U.S. My goal is to bring my unique perspective from that past experience, my current experience working in a new role at a large corporation, and my understanding of accounting to help break down some of the most exciting growth stocks on the market today.\n\nI\u2019m a long-term investor. I am focused on finding great companies and holding them for a long time. I\u2019m willing to endure volatility, crazy price drops, and everything that comes with this approach as long as the facts that led me to originally invest and believe in that company have not changed. If you want to learn more about this approach. I recommend reading the book \u201c100 Baggers\u201d by Chris Mayer.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nI\u2019m excited to share with you all my stock pick for this month, Smartsheet. I\u2019m always looking for investment ideas. I run stock screeners with different criteria (mostly focused on revenue growth), scan Twitter, talk to professionals in different industries, and try to observe what products or services are getting popular with my friends and family. One of the best investment decisions I\u2019ve made to date came after I talked to my friend about a drink he was drinking on the golf course. Shout out to you Celsius (CELH)! With that being said, you never know where your next good investment idea is going to come from.\n\nIn the case of Smartsheet, I became aware of the company through a stock screener. I was drawn to the relatively small market cap ($8.6B), strong revenue growth (roughly 35%), and the fact that it\u2019s a subscription business model (SaaS). Once I became aware of these facts, it cued me to take a deeper dive. The more I learned about Smartsheet, the more I liked. Management talks a lot about empowering people and that really struck a chord with me. In different roles I\u2019ve had as a teacher, tutor, and supervisor, I\u2019ve always found empowering people to be one of the most important keys to success. I will touch on this more later in the write up.\n\nAnother positive signal I got about Smartsheet came unexpectedly one evening. I was sitting in the kitchen and my girlfriend was cooking dinner. I was watching an interview on my phone with Mark Mader, the CEO of Smartsheet. My girlfriend overheard the word \u201cSmartsheet\u201d mentioned in the video and said \u201cAre they talking about the Smartsheet with the blue check mark?\u201d. I had to Google their logo but yes, it turns out we were thinking about the same Smartsheet. I asked her how she knew about it. She said \u201cMy company just transitioned all of our work onto Smartsheet. I really love it. Our marketing department is really excited about it because it makes their job way easier and more enjoyable.\u201d Hearing this just motivated me to learn more about Smartsheet.\n\n**The Thesis Statement**\n\nFor every stock pick I make, I want to provide a quick thesis statement that can serve as a reminder for why I\u2019m buying and holding that stock for the long term. I\u2019ll always aim to make it just a few sentences long so it can easily be remembered and internalized. This helps during times when the price may sporadically drop and you need to remember why you\u2019re holding this position.\n\nThe thesis statement I have come up with for Smartsheet is as follows:\n\n*\u201cSmartsheet: A leader in collaborative work management (CWM) software. As the global workforce becomes more decentralized through remote work, managers and executives now more than ever need a tool to digitally consolidate their teams, projects and deadlines. Smartsheet is that tool and is innovating to offer businesses even more ways to get the most out of their teams.\u201d*\n\nI think this thesis statement really captures the essence of what Smartsheet does. If you go to Smartsheet\u2019s website and look at the \u201cAbout\u201d page, you will find their \u201cAbout\u201d statement which says \u201cSmartsheet is the enterprise platform for dynamic work that aligns people and technology so your entire business can move faster, drive innovation, and achieve more.\u201d Notice how their statement emphasizes helping businesses move faster, drive innovation, and achieve more.\n\nIn my thesis statement, I mention that Smartsheet is a leader in the CWM software space. But how do I know this? Well, a highly reputable independent research firm named Forrester conducted a study on the CWM space based off different criteria including collaboration, enterprise capabilities, UI/user experience, planned enhancements and number of customers just to name a few of the factors considered. I put the companies that were identified from the study in the order of their ranking below. As you can see, Smartsheet is firmly planted as a leader in the space at 2nd place. Let\u2019s use our common sense for a second. At the beginning stages of a remote work revolution, do we want to invest in an up and coming SaaS company that focuses on providing firms with resources to digitally manage their teams, digitally manage work/projects, and digitally collaborate to get work done? I think the answer should be a resounding yes. But what about these other companies on the list. Let\u2019s break them down 1 by 1:\n\n* Workfront was recently bought by Adobe. If you want to invest in Workfront, you\u2019d have to invest in the much larger company of Adobe. It wouldn\u2019t be a pure play investment into the CWM space.\n* Smartsheet is 2nd and of course, they are public :)\n* Wrike is private\n* ServiceNow \u2013 CWM is just one small piece of their total      offerings. Investing here would not be a pure play into the CWM space.  Also, the company is already quite large ($106B market cap)\n* Asana is public but just IPO\u2019d on 9/30/20 about 3 months ago. We don\u2019t have much data to track their performance as a      publicly traded company. Furthermore, although they actually would be a pure play investment into the CWM space, they\u2019re not a leader and rank behind Smartsheet in several of Forrester\u2019s categories. Why invest in the 2nd best when you can invest in the best?\n* Monday.com is private\n* Microsoft \u2013 CWM is just one small piece of their total offerings. Investing here would not be a pure play into the CWM space.\n* Atlassian \u2013 This company does primarily focus on CWM but I have a couple problems with them as an investment. 1) They\u2019re ranked way beneath Smartsheet. 2) They\u2019re already too big for me to confidently say they can 10x (market cap already $58B).\n\nNow that we\u2019ve established that Smartsheet is a leader in the CWM space and that they\u2019re arguably the best publicly available pure-play investment in this space let\u2019s understand why this is important. Other than the obvious reason that we\u2019re in the beginning stages of a remote work revolution, why is this important?\n\nWell, let\u2019s take a look at this quote from Mark Mader, Smartsheet CEO, during the last earnings call (Q3 FY21) that occurred on December 7th, 2020:\n\n\u201cLeaders are recognizing they need to shift more workloads to asynchronous work, work that is documented, automated, tracked with dashboards, and where priorities are clearly defined. They understand that by empowering their teams with no-code solutions that facilitate asynchronous work, cycle times will be improved, a deeper sense of ownership will be created, and prioritization and accountability will be insured. Smartsheet is ideally suited to help enterprises work more asynchronously to derive the benefits from doing so.\u201d\n\nKey word here: Asynchronous. Asynchronous communication is different from Synchronous communication. Here is the difference:\n\nAsynchronous: email, message boards, dashboards, etc. \n\nSynchronous: video conferencing, chat, audio calls, etc. \n\nAny communication that doesn\u2019t require a real-time response can be considered asynchronous, like the examples in the picture above. Synchronous communication is any communication that happens in real time, thereby allowing for immediate responses, see examples above. As part of my research on Smartsheet, I read an E-Book that was written by the original co-founders of Smartsheet, Mark Mader the current CEO and Brent Frei who is no longer with the company. They wrote the E-Book in 2007 just a couple of years after the 2005 founding. The E-Book is called \u201cThe Power of Done\u201d. The moral of the book is that Mark and Brent noticed through their own experience, and through different research studies on work place productivity, that the rise in technology in the early 21st century was actually making employees less productive. This is a quote from their E-Book:\n\n\u201cAccording to Basex, a research firm focusing on the knowledge economy, interruptions from email, cell phones, instant messaging, text messaging and blogs eat up nearly 30 percent of each day; on an annualized basis, this represents a loss of 28 billion hours for the entire U.S. workforce, or a $588 billion cost to the American economy.\u201d\n\nThey mention in their book that although there has been a lot of advances in work technology such as email, word processing, and spreadsheets, there hadn\u2019t at that time been any great applications created for teamwork collaboration or task management. The fact that technology advances helped the world create tools to enhance productivity but also deterred productivity at the same time is what Mark and Brent referred to as the productivity paradox. They wanted to do something about it and thus they founded Smartsheet.\n\n**How Smartsheet makes money**\n\nAt the very least, before you invest in a company, you better understand how they make money. In Chris Mayers\u2019 excellent book, 100 Baggers, that I mentioned above, he continually references top line revenue growth as one of the main common indicators of a possible 100 Bagger. This isn\u2019t to tell you that any stock I pick will be a 100 Bagger just because it has great top line revenue growth, but if I am looking at a growth stock to hold for the long term, revenue growth is one of the first things I look at.\n\nBefore I talk about the revenue streams of Smartsheet, I want to share a little bit about the actual product that they sell to earn this revenue. Co-Founder/CEO Mark Mader realized that a lot of work in the corporate world was being done on spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel. However, he realized that these spreadsheets were largely static and not necessarily used to their full potential. He wanted to help people get more out of their use of spreadsheets. As a result, we now have Smartsheets which is a cloud based platform that can be accessed by all employees of the company no matter where they are with live information about project statuses, meeting times and work that is assigned to each employee just to name a few uses. Users can choose their way of viewing this information with different views such as calendar view, grid view, card view, and Gantt view. \n\nThe idea is that by enhancing the availability and quality of asynchronous information available to all members of a team about the status of a project, the tasks assigned, and the timelines, the less synchronous communication will be needed which allows employees to spend more time doing what they\u2019re hired to do \u2013 get work done. Think about how wasteful it is to hire a highly talented engineer but then make him spend half his day preparing for and doing status update meetings and hunting people down to see where they\u2019re at with their assignments. What if all this information was available for him, his managers, and his staff to see within Smartsheet without having to bother each other and waste precious work hours that could be used for coding, designing, and producing? That\u2019s what Smartsheet looks to achieve.\n\nFor Smartsheet, their means of making money is quite simple. As I mentioned earlier, they are a Software as a Service (SaaS) company. Whenever you see SaaS, that means subscription revenue and in my opinion that\u2019s a very good thing. With a subscription business model, the revenue is going to be recurring every year and that type of reliability (combined with growth of course) is something you want as an investor.\n\nSmartsheet\u2019s primary source of revenue is the sale of subscriptions to their cloud-based Collaborative Work Management (CWM) platform. Customers and potential customers begin their engagement with the Smartsheet platform by either signing up for a free trial, purchasing a subscription on the Smartsheet website, going through a sales rep, or they are exposed to Smartsheet by collaborating with a Company/Individual that uses Smartsheet.  For subscriptions, customers select the plan that meets their needs and can begin using Smartsheet within minutes.\n\nSmartsheet offers four subscription levels: Individual, Business, Enterprise, and Premier, the pricing for which varies by the capabilities provided. Customers can also purchase connectors, which provide data integration and automation to third-party applications.\n\nThe Connectors part of the business is something I find really interesting. Basically, Smartsheet has made deals with most of the top work productivity and communication software companies in the world to allow their customers to use those applications within their Smartsheet user interface. This helps position Smartsheet as the true \u201ccommand center\u201d platform while the products of the other companies become ancillary pieces. You\u2019ll see this on the link above but some products that Smartsheet sells Connectors for include Adobe Creative Cloud, Microsoft Dynamics 365, Salesforce, Jira Software, Slack, and Skype just to name a few.\n\nI think that being able to sell these Connectors as ancillary pieces to the Smartsheet user experience is so beneficial to Smartsheet because a lot of these companies that people may perceive as \u201cSmartsheet competitors\u201d actually become a piece of the Smartsheet platform and can be sold by Smartsheet as a supplemental revenue stream. This neutral angle that Smartsheet is able to come from by selling Connectors to their perceived \u201ccompetitors\u201d reminds me a little bit of how Roku (ROKU) is able to earn revenue off of selling a Netflix subscription on their platform. I think just the fact that all these big companies like Adobe, Jira, Salesforce, etc. allow their products to be integrated into Smartsheet shows that there is a high value proposition in the Smartsheet platform and that they would risk alienating their customers if they didn\u2019t allow for their products to be integrated with Smartsheet.\n\nOn top of the Connectors to third party vendors that Smartsheet is able to sell, Smartsheet is also able to sell upgrades to their own internal plug-ins. Smartsheet has some impressive proprietary plug-ins they can sell to their customers. For example, in May 2019, Smartsheet acquired 10,000ft which augmented their product portfolio by providing resource allocation and planning. The name \u201c10,000ft\u201d is meant to be analogous to having a high level view of your company and all resources available within your company and how to deploy them. \n\nAlso, in September 2020, Smartsheet acquired Brandfolder, Inc. which provides a centralized platform to organize, discover, control, distribute, and measure all forms of digital content. Combining Brandfolder capabilities with Smartsheet allows them to create dynamic solutions that manage workflows around content and collaboration. This goes back to what I said earlier in the article about how my girlfriend had mentioned that her company\u2019s marketing team was \u201creally excited about Smartsheet because it makes their job way easier and more enjoyable.\u201d She told me that before Smartsheet, her company\u2019s marketing team had to constantly hunt down members of the creative team (photographers, graphic designers) to receive the latest photos, videos, and digital designs they were working on. She said it was a big pain for them trying to share this content over email and SharePoint. Now, all of the content is inside of Smartsheet and the marketing team can access it at any time. They can leave comments on the content, route to appropriate individuals for approvals, and have better insight into the status of all digital content that is being worked on. The acquisition of Brandfolder is really what allows Smartsheet to stand out in this department. \n\nNobody really talks about it, but digital content is so important these days for companies in terms of controlling their brand image, putting out quality advertisements, and presenting their product in as positive of a light as possible. The fact that Smartsheet has a strong proprietary plug-in for this with Brandfolder is very promising. During Smartsheet\u2019s FY21 Engage Customer Conference, Anna Griffin, Smartsheet Chief Marketing Officer said that the global annual marketing spend is $500B for companies around the world. She said the role of the marketing department is changing from sole content creator to Editor in Chief. All kinds of teams within companies these days are putting out content that effects the company\u2019s brand. Sales is running social media campaigns, product marketing is putting out blog posts and podcasts, and R&amp;D is teasing new product experiences in app. It can get really difficult for the company\u2019s Marketing/Branding team to stay on top of all this without a centralized digital content collaboration platform like Brandfolder in Smartsheet. This is just one reason why I think Smartsheet has a lot of growth opportunities in the future.\n\nAs you can see, Smartsheet has a lot to offer to companies with their core CWM platform, the Connectors they can sell, and the internal upgrades available such as 10,000ft and Brandfolder. On top of that, Smartsheet also provides WorkApps, a proprietary no-code platform that empowers users to build intuitive web and mobile applications that streamline business and simplify collaboration. There are so many instances within companies where an app needs to be built to streamline a workflow. Traditionally, companies need to engage their IT departments and the coders that sit within these departments to build these apps. This places a lot of strain on IT departments and takes away time they can be spending on more complex/mission critical projects. Mark Mader is aware of this and thus is heavily pushing no-code as a solution for companies now and in the future. He believes that everyday non-coder employees know their jobs/workflows best and thus if you empower them to build their own apps with a no-code platform they will produce better and more relevant apps to help get work done than an IT department employee who doesn\u2019t even do the job that the app is being built for. Also, he believes this will reduce strain on IT departments and allow them to focus on more complex and mission critical projects.\n\nHere is a quote from the Director of Sales (Hina Patel) at a Smartsheet customer, Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO): \u201cI have been waiting for a solution like WorkApps that can give us quick and easy access to the content we need, when and where we need it,\u201d said Hina Patel, Director of Sales Operations at Cisco. \u201cThe ability to take our Smartsheet assets, along with other tools we use, and package an entire solution in an intuitive app will make it even easier to drive active participation from everyone involved in the process, no matter their role.\u201d As you can see, the value proposition of WorkApps and the Smartsheet platform appears to be high.\n\nLastly, Smartsheet also generates revenue from Professional Services which is essentially providing training and customized consulting to Smartsheet customers that want to get more out of the Smartsheet platform. In the most recent quarter, Q3 FY21, Professional Services accounted for 8.2% of revenue. Here is the breakout from the most recent quarter:\n\nSubscription revenue = $90,890M for 91.8% of total revenue\n\nProfessional services revenue = $8,043M for 8.2% of total revenue\n\nThis is the end of my first article about Smartsheet. My goal is to drop Part 2 within the next week. The focus of Part 2 will be an in depth answer of the question \u2013 \u201cCan we 10x from here?\u201d\n\n  **TL:DR**\n\n* This is Part 1 of my two part deep dive on Smartsheet (Ticker: SMAR). \n* This first part introduces you to (1) me, (2) the company, (3) my thesis on the company, and (4) digs into how they make money.\n* Part 2 (to be released later this week) will go in depth to explore the question \u201cCan we 10x from here?\u201d If you enjoyed this article and want to make sure you catch Part 2, [subscribe here.](https://onthemarkpicks.com/subscribe-today/) \n* Smartsheet is an exciting SaaS company that\u2019s helping businesses be more productive and get the most out of their people\n* I am not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice. These are just my opinions to help facilitate learning and discussion.\n\n**Disclosure:** I have no position in Smartsheet. I do plan to initiate a long position when the markets open again in 2021.  I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.",

About two years ago, I used to work as an auditor at a public accounting firm and have been behind the scenes at many different publicly traded and privately held companies in the U.S. My goal is to bring my unique perspective from that past experience, my current experience working in a new role at a large corporation, and my understanding of accounting to help break down some of the most exciting growth stocks on the market today.\n\nI\u2019m a long-term investor. I am focused on finding great companies and holding them for a long time. I\u2019m willing to endure volatility, crazy price drops, and everything that comes with this approach as long as the facts that led me to originally invest and believe in that company have not changed. If you want to learn more about this approach. I recommend reading the book \u201c100 Baggers\u201d by Chris Mayer.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nI\u2019m excited to share with you all my stock pick for this month, Smartsheet. I\u2019m always looking for investment ideas. I run stock screeners with different criteria (mostly focused on revenue growth), scan Twitter, talk to professionals in different industries, and try to observe what products or services are getting popular with my friends and family. One of the best investment decisions I\u2019ve made to date came after I talked to my friend about a drink he was drinking on the golf course. Shout out to you Celsius (CELH)! With that being said, you never know where your next good investment idea is going to come from.\n\nIn the case of Smartsheet, I became aware of the company through a stock screener. I was drawn to the relatively small market cap ($8.6B), strong revenue growth (roughly 35%), and the fact that it\u2019s a subscription business model (SaaS). Once I became aware of these facts, it cued me to take a deeper dive. The more I learned about Smartsheet, the more I liked. Management talks a lot about empowering people and that really struck a chord with me. In different roles I\u2019ve had as a teacher, tutor, and supervisor, I\u2019ve always found empowering people to be one of the most important keys to success. I will touch on this more later in the write up.\n\nAnother positive signal I got about Smartsheet came unexpectedly one evening. I was sitting in the kitchen and my girlfriend was cooking dinner. I was watching an interview on my phone with Mark Mader, the CEO of Smartsheet. My girlfriend overheard the word \u201cSmartsheet\u201d mentioned in the video and said \u201cAre they talking about the Smartsheet with the blue check mark?\u201d. I had to Google their logo but yes, it turns out we were thinking about the same Smartsheet. I asked her how she knew about it. She said \u201cMy company just transitioned all of our work onto Smartsheet. I really love it. Our marketing department is really excited about it because it makes their job way easier and more enjoyable.\u201d Hearing this just motivated me to learn more about Smartsheet.\n\n**The Thesis Statement**\n\nFor every stock pick I make, I want to provide a quick thesis statement that can serve as a reminder for why I\u2019m buying and holding that stock for the long term. I\u2019ll always aim to make it just a few sentences long so it can easily be remembered and internalized. This helps during times when the price may sporadically drop and you need to remember why you\u2019re holding this position.\n\nThe thesis statement I have come up with for Smartsheet is as follows:\n\n*\u201cSmartsheet: A leader in collaborative work management (CWM) software. As the global workforce becomes more decentralized through remote work, managers and executives now more than ever need a tool to digitally consolidate their teams, projects and deadlines. Smartsheet is that tool and is innovating to offer businesses even more ways to get the most out of their teams.\u201d*\n\nI think this thesis statement really captures the essence of what Smartsheet does. If you go to Smartsheet\u2019s website and look at the \u201cAbout\u201d page, you will find their \u201cAbout\u201d statement which says \u201cSmartsheet is the enterprise platform for dynamic work that aligns people and technology so your entire business can move faster, drive innovation, and achieve more.\u201d Notice how their statement emphasizes helping businesses move faster, drive innovation, and achieve more.\n\nIn my thesis statement, I mention that Smartsheet is a leader in the CWM software space. But how do I know this? Well, a highly reputable independent research firm named Forrester conducted a study on the CWM space based off different criteria including collaboration, enterprise capabilities, UI/user experience, planned enhancements and number of customers just to name a few of the factors considered. I put the companies that were identified from the study in the order of their ranking below. As you can see, Smartsheet is firmly planted as a leader in the space at 2nd place. Let\u2019s use our common sense for a second. At the beginning stages of a remote work revolution, do we want to invest in an up and coming SaaS company that focuses on providing firms with resources to digitally manage their teams, digitally manage work/projects, and digitally collaborate to get work done? I think the answer should be a resounding yes. But what about these other companies on the list. Let\u2019s break them down 1 by 1:\n\n* Workfront was recently bought by Adobe. If you want to invest in Workfront, you\u2019d have to invest in the much larger company of Adobe. It wouldn\u2019t be a pure play investment into the CWM space.\n* Smartsheet is 2nd and of course, they are public :)\n* Wrike is private\n* ServiceNow \u2013 CWM is just one small piece of their total offerings. Investing here would not be a pure play into the CWM space. Also, the company is already quite large ($106B market cap)\n* Asana is public but just IPO\u2019d on 9/30/20 about 3 months ago. We don\u2019t have much data to track their performance as a publicly traded company. Furthermore, although they actually would be a pure play investment into the CWM space, they\u2019re not a leader and rank behind Smartsheet in several of Forrester\u2019s categories. Why invest in the 2nd best when you can invest in the best?\n* Monday.com is private\n* Microsoft \u2013 CWM is just one small piece of their total offerings. Investing here would not be a pure play into the CWM space.\n* Atlassian \u2013 This company does primarily focus on CWM but I have a couple problems with them as an investment. 1) They\u2019re ranked way beneath Smartsheet. 2) They\u2019re already too big for me to confidently say they can 10x (market cap already $58B).\n\nNow that we\u2019ve established that Smartsheet is a leader in the CWM space and that they\u2019re arguably the best publicly available pure-play investment in this space let\u2019s understand why this is important. Other than the obvious reason that we\u2019re in the beginning stages of a remote work revolution, why is this important?\n\nWell, let\u2019s take a look at this quote from Mark Mader, Smartsheet CEO, during the last earnings call (Q3 FY21) that occurred on December 7th, 2020:\n\n\u201cLeaders are recognizing they need to shift more workloads to asynchronous work, work that is documented, automated, tracked with dashboards, and where priorities are clearly defined. They understand that by empowering their teams with no-code solutions that facilitate asynchronous work, cycle times will be improved, a deeper sense of ownership will be created, and prioritization and accountability will be insured. Smartsheet is ideally suited to help enterprises work more asynchronously to derive the benefits from doing so.\u201d\n\nKey word here: Asynchronous. Asynchronous communication is different from Synchronous communication. Here is the difference:\n\nAsynchronous: email, message boards, dashboards, etc.\n\nSynchronous: video conferencing, chat, audio calls, etc.\n\nAny communication that doesn\u2019t require a real-time response can be considered asynchronous, like the examples in the picture above. Synchronous communication is any communication that happens in real time, thereby allowing for immediate responses, see examples above. As part of my research on Smartsheet, I read an E-Book that was written by the original co-founders of Smartsheet, Mark Mader the current CEO and Brent Frei who is no longer with the company. They wrote the E-Book in 2007 just a couple of years after the 2005 founding. The E-Book is called \u201cThe Power of Done\u201d. The moral of the book is that Mark and Brent noticed through their own experience, and through different research studies on work place productivity, that the rise in technology in the early 21st century was actually making employees less productive. This is a quote from their E-Book:\n\n\u201cAccording to Basex, a research firm focusing on the knowledge economy, interruptions from email, cell phones, instant messaging, text messaging and blogs eat up nearly 30 percent of each day; on an annualized basis, this represents a loss of 28 billion hours for the entire U.S. workforce, or a $588 billion cost to the American economy.\u201d\n\nThey mention in their book that although there has been a lot of advances in work technology such as email, word processing, and spreadsheets, there hadn\u2019t at that time been any great applications created for teamwork collaboration or task management. The fact that technology advances helped the world create tools to enhance productivity but also deterred productivity at the same time is what Mark and Brent referred to as the productivity paradox. They wanted to do something about it and thus they founded Smartsheet.\n\n**How Smartsheet makes money**\n\nAt the very least, before you invest in a company, you better understand how they make money. In Chris Mayers\u2019 excellent book, 100 Baggers, that I mentioned above, he continually references top line revenue growth as one of the main common indicators of a possible 100 Bagger. This isn\u2019t to tell you that any stock I pick will be a 100 Bagger just because it has great top line revenue growth, but if I am looking at a growth stock to hold for the long term, revenue growth is one of the first things I look at.\n\nBefore I talk about the revenue streams of Smartsheet, I want to share a little bit about the actual product that they sell to earn this revenue. Co-Founder/CEO Mark Mader realized that a lot of work in the corporate world was being done on spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel. However, he realized that these spreadsheets were largely static and not necessarily used to their full potential. He wanted to help people get more out of their use of spreadsheets. As a result, we now have Smartsheets which is a cloud based platform that can be accessed by all employees of the company no matter where they are with live information about project statuses, meeting times and work that is assigned to each employee just to name a few uses. Users can choose their way of viewing this information with different views such as calendar view, grid view, card view, and Gantt view.\n\nThe idea is that by enhancing the availability and quality of asynchronous information available to all members of a team about the status of a project, the tasks assigned, and the timelines, the less synchronous communication will be needed which allows employees to spend more time doing what they\u2019re hired to do \u2013 get work done. Think about how wasteful it is to hire a highly talented engineer but then make him spend half his day preparing for and doing status update meetings and hunting people down to see where they\u2019re at with their assignments. What if all this information was available for him, his managers, and his staff to see within Smartsheet without having to bother each other and waste precious work hours that could be used for coding, designing, and producing? That\u2019s what Smartsheet looks to achieve.\n\nFor Smartsheet, their means of making money is quite simple. As I mentioned earlier, they are a Software as a Service (SaaS) company. Whenever you see SaaS, that means subscription revenue and in my opinion that\u2019s a very good thing. With a subscription business model, the revenue is going to be recurring every year and that type of reliability (combined with growth of course) is something you want as an investor.\n\nSmartsheet\u2019s primary source of revenue is the sale of subscriptions to their cloud-based Collaborative Work Management (CWM) platform. Customers and potential customers begin their engagement with the Smartsheet platform by either signing up for a free trial, purchasing a subscription on the Smartsheet website, going through a sales rep, or they are exposed to Smartsheet by collaborating with a Company/Individual that uses Smartsheet. For subscriptions, customers select the plan that meets their needs and can begin using Smartsheet within minutes.\n\nSmartsheet offers four subscription levels: Individual, Business, Enterprise, and Premier, the pricing for which varies by the capabilities provided. Customers can also purchase connectors, which provide data integration and automation to third-party applications.\n\nThe Connectors part of the business is something I find really interesting. Basically, Smartsheet has made deals with most of the top work productivity and communication software companies in the world to allow their customers to use those applications within their Smartsheet user interface. This helps position Smartsheet as the true \u201ccommand center\u201d platform while the products of the other companies become ancillary pieces. You\u2019ll see this on the link above but some products that Smartsheet sells Connectors for include Adobe Creative Cloud, Microsoft Dynamics 365, Salesforce, Jira Software, Slack, and Skype just to name a few.\n\nI think that being able to sell these Connectors as ancillary pieces to the Smartsheet user experience is so beneficial to Smartsheet because a lot of these companies that people may perceive as \u201cSmartsheet competitors\u201d actually become a piece of the Smartsheet platform and can be sold by Smartsheet as a supplemental revenue stream. This neutral angle that Smartsheet is able to come from by selling Connectors to their perceived \u201ccompetitors\u201d reminds me a little bit of how Roku (ROKU) is able to earn revenue off of selling a Netflix subscription on their platform. I think just the fact that all these big companies like Adobe, Jira, Salesforce, etc. allow their products to be integrated into Smartsheet shows that there is a high value proposition in the Smartsheet platform and that they would risk alienating their customers if they didn\u2019t allow for their products to be integrated with Smartsheet.\n\nOn top of the Connectors to third party vendors that Smartsheet is able to sell, Smartsheet is also able to sell upgrades to their own internal plug-ins. Smartsheet has some impressive proprietary plug-ins they can sell to their customers. For example, in May 2019, Smartsheet acquired 10,000ft which augmented their product portfolio by providing resource allocation and planning. The name \u201c10,000ft\u201d is meant to be analogous to having a high level view of your company and all resources available within your company and how to deploy them.\n\nAlso, in September 2020, Smartsheet acquired Brandfolder, Inc. which provides a centralized platform to organize, discover, control, distribute, and measure all forms of digital content. Combining Brandfolder capabilities with Smartsheet allows them to create dynamic solutions that manage workflows around content and collaboration. This goes back to what I said earlier in the article about how my girlfriend had mentioned that her company\u2019s marketing team was \u201creally excited about Smartsheet because it makes their job way easier and more enjoyable.\u201d She told me that before Smartsheet, her company\u2019s marketing team had to constantly hunt down members of the creative team (photographers, graphic designers) to receive the latest photos, videos, and digital designs they were working on. She said it was a big pain for them trying to share this content over email and SharePoint. Now, all of the content is inside of Smartsheet and the marketing team can access it at any time. They can leave comments on the content, route to appropriate individuals for approvals, and have better insight into the status of all digital content that is being worked on. The acquisition of Brandfolder is really what allows Smartsheet to stand out in this department.\n\nNobody really talks about it, but digital content is so important these days for companies in terms of controlling their brand image, putting out quality advertisements, and presenting their product in as positive of a light as possible. The fact that Smartsheet has a strong proprietary plug-in for this with Brandfolder is very promising. During Smartsheet\u2019s FY21 Engage Customer Conference, Anna Griffin, Smartsheet Chief Marketing Officer said that the global annual marketing spend is $500B for companies around the world. She said the role of the marketing department is changing from sole content creator to Editor in Chief. All kinds of teams within companies these days are putting out content that effects the company\u2019s brand. Sales is running social media campaigns, product marketing is putting out blog posts and podcasts, and R&amp;D is teasing new product experiences in app. It can get really difficult for the company\u2019s Marketing/Branding team to stay on top of all this without a centralized digital content collaboration platform like Brandfolder in Smartsheet. This is just one reason why I think Smartsheet has a lot of growth opportunities in the future.\n\nAs you can see, Smartsheet has a lot to offer to companies with their core CWM platform, the Connectors they can sell, and the internal upgrades available such as 10,000ft and Brandfolder. On top of that, Smartsheet also provides WorkApps, a proprietary no-code platform that empowers users to build intuitive web and mobile applications that streamline business and simplify collaboration. There are so many instances within companies where an app needs to be built to streamline a workflow. Traditionally, companies need to engage their IT departments and the coders that sit within these departments to build these apps. This places a lot of strain on IT departments and takes away time they can be spending on more complex/mission critical projects. Mark Mader is aware of this and thus is heavily pushing no-code as a solution for companies now and in the future. He believes that everyday non-coder employees know their jobs/workflows best and thus if you empower them to build their own apps with a no-code platform they will produce better and more relevant apps to help get work done than an IT department employee who doesn\u2019t even do the job that the app is being built for. Also, he believes this will reduce strain on IT departments and allow them to focus on more complex and mission critical projects.\n\nHere is a quote from the Director of Sales (Hina Patel) at a Smartsheet customer, Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO): \u201cI have been waiting for a solution like WorkApps that can give us quick and easy access to the content we need, when and where we need it,\u201d said Hina Patel, Director of Sales Operations at Cisco. \u201cThe ability to take our Smartsheet assets, along with other tools we use, and package an entire solution in an intuitive app will make it even easier to drive active participation from everyone involved in the process, no matter their role.\u201d As you can see, the value proposition of WorkApps and the Smartsheet platform appears to be high.\n\nLastly, Smartsheet also generates revenue from Professional Services which is essentially providing training and customized consulting to Smartsheet customers that want to get more out of the Smartsheet platform. In the most recent quarter, Q3 FY21, Professional Services accounted for 8.2% of revenue. Here is the breakout from the most recent quarter:\n\nSubscription revenue = $90,890M for 91.8% of total revenue\n\nProfessional services revenue = $8,043M for 8.2% of total revenue\n\nThis is the end of my first article about Smartsheet. My goal is to drop Part 2 within the next week. The focus of Part 2 will be an in depth answer of the question \u2013 \u201cCan we 10x from here?\u201d\n\n**TL:DR**\n\n* This is Part 1 of my two part deep dive on Smartsheet (Ticker: SMAR).\n* This first part introduces you to (1) me, (2) the company, (3) my thesis on the company, and (4) digs into how they make money.\n* Part 2 (to be released later this week) will go in depth to explore the question \u201cCan we 10x from here?\u201d\n* Smartsheet is an exciting SaaS company that\u2019s helping businesses be more productive and get the most out of their people\n* I am not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice. These are just my opinions to help facilitate learning and discussion.\n\n**Disclosure:** I am long Smartsheet. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

This   is a quote from their E-Book:\n\n\u201cAccording   to Basex, a research firm focusing on the knowledge economy,   interruptions from email, cell phones, instant messaging, text messaging   and blogs eat up nearly 30 percent of each day; on an annualized  basis,  this represents a loss of 28 billion hours for the entire U.S.   workforce, or a $588 billion cost to the American economy.\u201d\n\nThey   mention in their book that although there has been a lot of advances  in  work technology such as email, word processing, and spreadsheets,  there  hadn\u2019t at that time been any great applications created for  teamwork  collaboration or task management. The fact that technology  advances  helped the world create tools to enhance productivity but also  deterred  productivity at the same time is what Mark and Brent referred  to as the  productivity paradox. They wanted to do something about it  and thus they  founded Smartsheet.\n\n**How Smartsheet makes money**\n\nAt   the very least, before you invest in a company, you better understand   how they make money. In Chris Mayers\u2019 excellent book, 100 Baggers, that  I  mentioned above, he continually references top line revenue growth  as  one of the main common indicators of a possible 100 Bagger. This  isn\u2019t  to tell you that any stock I pick will be a 100 Bagger just  because it  has great top line revenue growth, but if I am looking at a  growth stock  to hold for the long term, revenue growth is one of the  first things I  look at.\n\nBefore I  talk about the  revenue streams of Smartsheet, I want to share a little  bit about the  actual product that they sell to earn this revenue.  Co-Founder/CEO Mark  Mader realized that a lot of work in the corporate  world was being done  on spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel. However,  he realized that these  spreadsheets were largely static and not  necessarily used to their full  potential. He wanted to help people get  more out of their use of  spreadsheets. As a result, we now have  Smartsheets which is a cloud  based platform that can be accessed by all  employees of the company no  matter where they are with live  information about project statuses,  meeting times and work that is  assigned to each employee just to name a  few uses. Users can choose  their way of viewing this information with  different views such as  calendar view, grid view, card view, and Gantt  view.\n\nThe  idea is that by  enhancing the availability and quality of asynchronous  information  available to all members of a team about the status of a  project, the  tasks assigned, and the timelines, the less synchronous  communication  will be needed which allows employees to spend more time  doing what  they\u2019re hired to do \u2013 get work done. Think about how  wasteful it is to  hire a highly talented engineer but then make him  spend half his day  preparing for and doing status update meetings and  hunting people down  to see where they\u2019re at with their assignments.  What if all this  information was available for him, his managers, and  his staff to see  within Smartsheet without having to bother each other  and waste precious  work hours that could be used for coding, designing,  and producing?  That\u2019s what Smartsheet looks to achieve.\n\nFor   Smartsheet, their means of making money is quite simple. As I  mentioned  earlier, they are a Software as a Service (SaaS) company.  Whenever you  see SaaS, that means subscription revenue and in my  opinion that\u2019s a  very good thing. With a subscription business model,  the revenue is  going to be recurring every year and that type of  reliability (combined  with growth of course) is something you want as  an investor.\n\nSmartsheet\u2019s  primary  source of revenue is the sale of subscriptions to their  cloud-based  Collaborative Work Management (CWM) platform. Customers and  potential  customers begin their engagement with the Smartsheet platform  by either  signing up for a free trial, purchasing a subscription on the   Smartsheet website, going through a sales rep, or they are exposed to   Smartsheet by collaborating with a Company/Individual that uses   Smartsheet.  For subscriptions, customers select the plan that meets   their needs and can begin using Smartsheet within minutes.\n\nSmartsheet   offers four subscription levels: Individual, Business, Enterprise, and   Premier, the pricing for which varies by the capabilities provided.   Customers can also purchase connectors, which provide data integration   and automation to third-party applications.\n\nThe   Connectors part of the business is something I find really  interesting.  Basically, Smartsheet has made deals with most of the top  work  productivity and communication software companies in the world to  allow  their customers to use those applications within their Smartsheet  user  interface. This helps position Smartsheet as the true \u201ccommand  center\u201d  platform while the products of the other companies become  ancillary  pieces. You\u2019ll see this on the link above but some products  that  Smartsheet sells Connectors for include Adobe Creative Cloud,  Microsoft  Dynamics 365, Salesforce, Jira Software, Slack, and Skype  just to name a  few.\n\nI think that  being able to  sell these Connectors as ancillary pieces to the  Smartsheet user  experience is so beneficial to Smartsheet because a lot  of these  companies that people may perceive as \u201cSmartsheet  competitors\u201d actually  become a piece of the Smartsheet platform and can  be sold by Smartsheet  as a supplemental revenue stream. This neutral  angle that Smartsheet is  able to come from by selling Connectors to  their perceived \u201ccompetitors\u201d  reminds me a little bit of how Roku  (ROKU) is able to earn revenue off  of selling a Netflix subscription on  their platform. I think just the  fact that all these big companies  like Adobe, Jira, Salesforce, etc.  allow their products to be  integrated into Smartsheet shows that there  is a high value proposition  in the Smartsheet platform and that they  would risk alienating their  customers if they didn\u2019t allow for their  products to be integrated with  Smartsheet.\n\nOn  top of the  Connectors to third party vendors that Smartsheet is able to  sell,  Smartsheet is also able to sell upgrades to their own internal   plug-ins. Smartsheet has some impressive proprietary plug-ins they can   sell to their customers. For example, in May 2019, Smartsheet acquired   10,000ft which augmented their product portfolio by providing resource   allocation and planning. The name \u201c10,000ft\u201d is meant to be analogous to   having a high level view of your company and all resources available   within your company and how to deploy them.\n\nAlso,   in September 2020, Smartsheet acquired Brandfolder, Inc. which  provides  a centralized platform to organize, discover, control,  distribute, and  measure all forms of digital content. Combining  Brandfolder capabilities  with Smartsheet allows them to create dynamic  solutions that manage  workflows around content and collaboration. This  goes back to what I  said earlier in the article about how my girlfriend  had mentioned that  her company\u2019s marketing team was \u201creally excited  about Smartsheet  because it makes their job way easier and more  enjoyable.\u201d She told me  that before Smartsheet, her company\u2019s marketing  team had to constantly  hunt down members of the creative team  (photographers, graphic  designers) to receive the latest photos,  videos, and digital designs  they were working on. She said it was a big  pain for them trying to  share this content over email and SharePoint.  Now, all of the content is  inside of Smartsheet and the marketing team  can access it at any time.  They can leave comments on the content,  route to appropriate individuals  for approvals, and have better insight  into the status of all digital  content that is being worked on. The  acquisition of Brandfolder is  really what allows Smartsheet to stand  out in this department.\n\nNobody   really talks about it, but digital content is so important these days   for companies in terms of controlling their brand image, putting out   quality advertisements, and presenting their product in as positive of a   light as possible. The fact that Smartsheet has a strong proprietary   plug-in for this with Brandfolder is very promising. During Smartsheet\u2019s   FY21 Engage Customer Conference, Anna Griffin, Smartsheet Chief   Marketing Officer said that the global annual marketing spend is $500B   for companies around the world. She said the role of the marketing   department is changing from sole content creator to Editor in Chief. All   kinds of teams within companies these days are putting out content  that  effects the company\u2019s brand. Sales is running social media  campaigns,  product marketing is putting out blog posts and podcasts,  and R&amp;D is  teasing new product experiences in app. It can get  really difficult for  the company\u2019s Marketing/Branding team to stay on  top of all this  without a centralized digital content collaboration  platform like  Brandfolder in Smartsheet. This is just one reason why I  think  Smartsheet has a lot of growth opportunities in the future.\n\nAs   you can see, Smartsheet has a lot to offer to companies with their  core  CWM platform, the Connectors they can sell, and the internal  upgrades  available such as 10,000ft and Brandfolder. On top of that,  Smartsheet  also provides WorkApps, a proprietary no-code platform that  empowers  users to build intuitive web and mobile applications that  streamline  business and simplify collaboration. There are so many  instances within  companies where an app needs to be built to streamline  a workflow.  Traditionally, companies need to engage their IT  departments and the  coders that sit within these departments to build  these apps. This  places a lot of strain on IT departments and takes  away time they can be  spending on more complex/mission critical  projects. Mark Mader is aware  of this and thus is heavily pushing  no-code as a solution for companies  now and in the future. He believes  that everyday non-coder employees  know their jobs/workflows best and  thus if you empower them to build  their own apps with a no-code  platform they will produce better and more  relevant apps to help get  work done than an IT department employee who  doesn\u2019t even do the job  that the app is being built for. Also, he  believes this will reduce  strain on IT departments and allow them to  focus on more complex and  mission critical projects.\n\nHere   is a quote from the Director of Sales (Hina Patel) at a Smartsheet   customer, Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO): \u201cI have been waiting for a solution like   WorkApps that can give us quick and easy access to the content we  need,  when and where we need it,\u201d said Hina Patel, Director of Sales   Operations at Cisco. \u201cThe ability to take our Smartsheet assets, along   with other tools we use, and package an entire solution in an intuitive   app will make it even easier to drive active participation from  everyone  involved in the process, no matter their role.\u201d As you can  see, the  value proposition of WorkApps and the Smartsheet platform  appears to be  high.\n\nLastly,  Smartsheet also  generates revenue from Professional Services which is  essentially  providing training and customized consulting to Smartsheet  customers  that want to get more out of the Smartsheet platform. In the  most recent  quarter, Q3 FY21, Professional Services accounted for 8.2%  of revenue.  Here is the breakout from the most recent quarter:\n\nSubscription revenue = $90,890M for 91.8% of total revenue\n\nProfessional services revenue = $8,043M for 8.2% of total revenue\n\nThis   is the end of my first article about Smartsheet. My goal is to drop   Part 2 within the next week. The focus of Part 2 will be an in depth   answer of the question \u2013 \u201cCan we 10x from here?\u201d\n\n**TL:DR**\n\n* This is Part 1 of my two part deep dive on Smartsheet (Ticker: SMAR).\n* This first part introduces you to (1) me, (2) the company, (3) my thesis on the company, and (4) digs into how they make money.\n* Smartsheet is an exciting SaaS company that\u2019s helping businesses be more productive and get the most out of their people\n* I  am not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice. These  are  just my opinions to help facilitate learning and discussion.\n\n**Disclosure:**   I have no position in Smartsheet. I do plan to initiate a long  position  when the markets open again in 2021.  I wrote this article  myself, and  it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving  compensation for it.

The company offers physical protection services, including guarding, patrol and rapid response, intelligent perimeter protection, secure transport, and international security travel advisory and transport services.\n\nIt also provides monitoring services, such as alarm and video monitoring, analytics, verification, and electronic building management. In addition, the company offers a suite of home and corporate security services comprising system design, access control, and video and systems installation and service; and integrated solutions, which include security, lighting, audio and video, blind, and temperature control in the home and commercial automation, and custom electronic integration industry.\n\nFurther, it provides locksmith solutions, including high-security locks, master-keys, ironworks and gates, key cutting, and lock repairs for homes, businesses, and automobiles; and hardware products under the ADH brand.\n\n**Highlights:**\n\n* 2020 Q2 revenues of $23.6 million representing sequential growth of 29.7% and 130.9% YoY\n* Increase in recurring monthly revenue and contractual revenue streams, representing 80.6% of Q2 revenue versus 67.2% during the comparable period last year.\n* Strong YoY revenue growth since 2015\n* Frequent insider buying in the last 6 months\n* Clean share structure \u2013 Solid insider and institutional ownership\n* Analyst price targets of $2.50 (60% upside)\n\nCanaccord Genuity's rating of Avante Logixx Inc.

As with most growth companies which undertake a series of acquisitions within a short period of time, they sustained losses from the added expenses incurred during the integration period.\n\nNow the benefits of the Company\u2019s investments and scale are showing results. As such Avante's financials have crossed the inflection point, whereby operating leverage has materialized, which has strengthened EBITDA and EBITDA margins, also leading to strong cash generation.\n\nToday, the Company has two major platforms across six business segments that offer specialized security services, providing a strong foundation for future growth.\n\nThe larger platform is Logixx Security Inc., a full-service, one-stop shop security solutions provider for large, national multi-site enterprise customers where security is \"mission critical\" to success. Offerings to such enterprises include protective services, electronic security, cyber security, monitoring and managed services.\n\nThe Company has a diversified base of contracts with enterprise customers that are high in value and generate multi-year contractual revenue. Currently, Logixx Security comprises about 80% of Avante Logixx\u2019s revenue base.\n\nThe remaining 20% of the Company\u2019s revenue base is derived from Avante Security. Avante Security is a full-service, one-stop shop security solutions provider for ultra-high net worth residential clients for their homes, most of which are located in Toronto and Muskoka, Ontario. Revenues generated by Avante Security are mostly recurring on a monthly basis for monitoring services, plus security hardware installations.\n\nThe inflection point is most evident in Avante's recently reported fiscal Q2 fiscal 2021 financials. The Company generated record quarterly revenues from continuing operations of C$23.6 million for the three months ended Sept. 30, 2020.\n\nThis represents sequential growth of about 30% and 131% year-over-year growth. About 80% of the total revenues generated in this quarter are either multi-year contractual or monthly recurring in nature.\n\nAvante also generated adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations during Q2 2021 of C$1.7 million or 7.3% of revenues, which is a sequential improvement of C$1.1 million or improvement of C$1.2 million from the prior year. This is a significant turnaround in profitability and is expected to continue.\n\nManagement and Board stock ownership is steadily increasing and the company has put in place share ownership guidelines, and compensation is linked to performance.\n\nBased on the fact that Avante Logixx\u2019s shares currently trading at a very low P/S ratio of 0.41 and has a predictable revenue model, when coupled with the EBITDA momentum reported, I believe there is strong stock price appreciation potential from its current trading levels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Downsides**\n\n* Gross Margin and EPS have slowly declined in last couple years. Although there has been significant margin improvements in their last quarter, it is too early to tell if this trend will continue.\n* Total debt has also increased substantially in the last 2 years, however a large part of this debt can be attributed to a multitude of acquisitions and the added expenses incurred during the integration period.\n* The CEO's salary is also higher than I would generally like to see for a company of this size.

        "selftext": "**TL:DR is at the bottom**\n\nHello, welcome to my second deep dive write up.\n\nMy  name\u2019s Mark and I\u2019m an accountant with a passion for investing. About  two years ago, I used to work as an auditor at a public accounting firm  and have been behind the scenes at many different publicly traded and  privately held companies in the U.S. My goal is to bring my unique  perspective from that past experience, my current experience working in a  new role at a large corporation, and my understanding of accounting to  help break down some of the most exciting growth stocks on the market  today.\n\nI\u2019m a long-term investor. I  am focused on finding great companies and holding them for a long time.  I\u2019m willing to endure volatility, crazy price drops, and everything  that comes with this approach as long as the facts that led me to  originally invest and believe in that company have not changed. If you  want to learn more about this approach. I recommend reading the book  \u201c100 Baggers\u201d by Chris Mayer.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nI\u2019m  excited to share with you all my stock pick for this month, Smartsheet.  I\u2019m always looking for investment ideas. I run stock screeners with  different criteria (mostly focused on revenue growth), scan Twitter,  talk to professionals in different industries, and try to observe what  products or services are getting popular with my friends and family. One  of the best investment decisions I\u2019ve made to date came after I talked  to my friend about a drink he was drinking on the golf course. Shout out  to you Celsius (CELH)! With that being said, you never know where your  next good investment idea is going to come from.\n\nIn  the case of Smartsheet, I became aware of the company through a stock  screener. I was drawn to the relatively small market cap ($8.6B), strong  revenue growth (roughly 35%), and the fact that it\u2019s a subscription  business model (SaaS). Once I became aware of these facts, it cued me to  take a deeper dive. The more I learned about Smartsheet, the more I  liked. Management talks a lot about empowering people and that really  struck a chord with me. In different roles I\u2019ve had as a teacher, tutor,  and supervisor, I\u2019ve always found empowering people to be one of the  most important keys to success. I will touch on this more later in the  write up.\n\nAnother positive signal I  got about Smartsheet came unexpectedly one evening. I was sitting in  the kitchen and my girlfriend was cooking dinner. I was watching an  interview on my phone with Mark Mader, the CEO of Smartsheet. My  girlfriend overheard the word \u201cSmartsheet\u201d mentioned in the video and  said \u201cAre they talking about the Smartsheet with the blue check mark?\u201d. I  had to Google their logo but yes, it turns out we were thinking about  the same Smartsheet. I asked her how she knew about it. She said \u201cMy  company just transitioned all of our work onto Smartsheet. I really love  it. Our marketing department is really excited about it because it  makes their job way easier and more enjoyable.\u201d Hearing this just  motivated me to learn more about Smartsheet.\n\n**The Thesis Statement**\n\nFor  every stock pick I make, I want to provide a quick thesis statement  that can serve as a reminder for why I\u2019m buying and holding that stock  for the long term. I\u2019ll always aim to make it just a few sentences long  so it can easily be remembered and internalized. This helps during times  when the price may sporadically drop and you need to remember why  you\u2019re holding this position.\n\nThe thesis statement I have come up with for Smartsheet is as follows:\n\n*\u201cSmartsheet:  A leader in collaborative work management (CWM) software. As the global  workforce becomes more decentralized through remote work, managers and  executives now more than ever need a tool to digitally consolidate their  teams, projects and deadlines. Smartsheet is that tool and is  innovating to offer businesses even more ways to get the most out of  their teams.\u201d*\n\nI think this  thesis statement really captures the essence of what Smartsheet does. If  you go to Smartsheet\u2019s website and look at the \u201cAbout\u201d page, you will  find their \u201cAbout\u201d statement which says \u201cSmartsheet is the enterprise  platform for dynamic work that aligns people and technology so your  entire business can move faster, drive innovation, and achieve more.\u201d  Notice how their statement emphasizes helping businesses move faster,  drive innovation, and achieve more.\n\nIn  my thesis statement, I mention that Smartsheet is a leader in the CWM  software space. But how do I know this? Well, a highly reputable  independent research firm named Forrester conducted a study on the CWM  space based off different criteria including collaboration, enterprise  capabilities, UI/user experience, planned enhancements and number of  customers just to name a few of the factors considered. I put the  companies that were identified from the study in the order of their  ranking below. As you can see, Smartsheet is firmly planted as a leader  in the space at 2nd place. Let\u2019s use our common sense for a second. At  the beginning stages of a remote work revolution, do we want to invest  in an up and coming SaaS company that focuses on providing firms with  resources to digitally manage their teams, digitally manage  work/projects, and digitally collaborate to get work done? I think the  answer should be a resounding yes. But what about these other companies  on the list. Let\u2019s break them down 1 by 1:\n\n* Workfront  was recently bought by Adobe. If you want to invest in Workfront, you\u2019d  have to invest in the much larger company of Adobe. It wouldn\u2019t be a  pure play investment into the CWM space.\n* Smartsheet is 2nd and of course, they are public :)\n* Wrike is private\n* ServiceNow  \u2013 CWM is just one small piece of their total      offerings. Investing  here would not be a pure play into the CWM space.  Also, the company is  already quite large ($106B market cap)\n* Asana  is public but just IPO\u2019d on 9/30/20 about 3 months ago. We don\u2019t have  much data to track their performance as a      publicly traded company.  Furthermore, although they actually would be a pure play investment into  the CWM space, they\u2019re not a leader and rank behind Smartsheet in  several of Forrester\u2019s categories. Why invest in the 2nd best when you  can invest in the best?\n* Monday.com is private\n* Microsoft \u2013 CWM is just one small piece of their total offerings. Investing here would not be a pure play into the CWM space.\n* Atlassian  \u2013 This company does primarily focus on CWM but I have a couple problems  with them as an investment. 1) They\u2019re ranked way beneath Smartsheet.  2) They\u2019re already too big for me to confidently say they can 10x  (market cap already $58B).\n\nNow  that we\u2019ve established that Smartsheet is a leader in the CWM space and  that they\u2019re arguably the best publicly available pure-play investment  in this space let\u2019s understand why this is important. Other than the  obvious reason that we\u2019re in the beginning stages of a remote work  revolution, why is this important?\n\nWell,  let\u2019s take a look at this quote from Mark Mader, Smartsheet CEO, during  the last earnings call (Q3 FY21) that occurred on December 7th, 2020:\n\n\u201cLeaders  are recognizing they need to shift more workloads to asynchronous work,  work that is documented, automated, tracked with dashboards, and where  priorities are clearly defined. They understand that by empowering their  teams with no-code solutions that facilitate asynchronous work, cycle  times will be improved, a deeper sense of ownership will be created, and  prioritization and accountability will be insured. Smartsheet is  ideally suited to help enterprises work more asynchronously to derive  the benefits from doing so.\u201d\n\nKey word here: Asynchronous. Asynchronous communication is different from Synchronous communication. Here is the difference:\n\nAsynchronous: email, message boards, dashboards, etc.\n\nSynchronous: video conferencing, chat, audio calls, etc.\n\nAny  communication that doesn\u2019t require a real-time response can be  considered asynchronous, like the examples in the picture above.  Synchronous communication is any communication that happens in real  time, thereby allowing for immediate responses, see examples above. As  part of my research on Smartsheet, I read an E-Book that was written by  the original co-founders of Smartsheet, Mark Mader the current CEO and  Brent Frei who is no longer with the company. They wrote the E-Book in  2007 just a couple of years after the 2005 founding. The E-Book is  called \u201cThe Power of Done\u201d. The moral of the book is that Mark and Brent  noticed through their own experience, and through different research  studies on work place productivity, that the rise in technology in the  early 21st century was actually making employees less productive. This  is a quote from their E-Book:\n\n\u201cAccording  to Basex, a research firm focusing on the knowledge economy,  interruptions from email, cell phones, instant messaging, text messaging  and blogs eat up nearly 30 percent of each day; on an annualized basis,  this represents a loss of 28 billion hours for the entire U.S.  workforce, or a $588 billion cost to the American economy.\u201d\n\nThey  mention in their book that although there has been a lot of advances in  work technology such as email, word processing, and spreadsheets, there  hadn\u2019t at that time been any great applications created for teamwork  collaboration or task management. The fact that technology advances  helped the world create tools to enhance productivity but also deterred  productivity at the same time is what Mark and Brent referred to as the  productivity paradox. They wanted to do something about it and thus they  founded Smartsheet.\n\n**How Smartsheet makes money**\n\nAt  the very least, before you invest in a company, you better understand  how they make money. In Chris Mayers\u2019 excellent book, 100 Baggers, that I  mentioned above, he continually references top line revenue growth as  one of the main common indicators of a possible 100 Bagger. This isn\u2019t  to tell you that any stock I pick will be a 100 Bagger just because it  has great top line revenue growth, but if I am looking at a growth stock  to hold for the long term, revenue growth is one of the first things I  look at.\n\nBefore I talk about the  revenue streams of Smartsheet, I want to share a little bit about the  actual product that they sell to earn this revenue. Co-Founder/CEO Mark  Mader realized that a lot of work in the corporate world was being done  on spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel. However, he realized that these  spreadsheets were largely static and not necessarily used to their full  potential. He wanted to help people get more out of their use of  spreadsheets. As a result, we now have Smartsheets which is a cloud  based platform that can be accessed by all employees of the company no  matter where they are with live information about project statuses,  meeting times and work that is assigned to each employee just to name a  few uses. Users can choose their way of viewing this information with  different views such as calendar view, grid view, card view, and Gantt  view.\n\nThe idea is that by  enhancing the availability and quality of asynchronous information  available to all members of a team about the status of a project, the  tasks assigned, and the timelines, the less synchronous communication  will be needed which allows employees to spend more time doing what  they\u2019re hired to do \u2013 get work done. Think about how wasteful it is to  hire a highly talented engineer but then make him spend half his day  preparing for and doing status update meetings and hunting people down  to see where they\u2019re at with their assignments. What if all this  information was available for him, his managers, and his staff to see  within Smartsheet without having to bother each other and waste precious  work hours that could be used for coding, designing, and producing?  That\u2019s what Smartsheet looks to achieve.\n\nFor  Smartsheet, their means of making money is quite simple. As I mentioned  earlier, they are a Software as a Service (SaaS) company. Whenever you  see SaaS, that means subscription revenue and in my opinion that\u2019s a  very good thing. With a subscription business model, the revenue is  going to be recurring every year and that type of reliability (combined  with growth of course) is something you want as an investor.\n\nSmartsheet\u2019s  primary source of revenue is the sale of subscriptions to their  cloud-based Collaborative Work Management (CWM) platform. Customers and  potential customers begin their engagement with the Smartsheet platform  by either signing up for a free trial, purchasing a subscription on the  Smartsheet website, going through a sales rep, or they are exposed to  Smartsheet by collaborating with a Company/Individual that uses  Smartsheet.  For subscriptions, customers select the plan that meets  their needs and can begin using Smartsheet within minutes.\n\nSmartsheet  offers four subscription levels: Individual, Business, Enterprise, and  Premier, the pricing for which varies by the capabilities provided.  Customers can also purchase connectors, which provide data integration  and automation to third-party applications.\n\nThe  Connectors part of the business is something I find really interesting.  Basically, Smartsheet has made deals with most of the top work  productivity and communication software companies in the world to allow  their customers to use those applications within their Smartsheet user  interface. This helps position Smartsheet as the true \u201ccommand center\u201d  platform while the products of the other companies become ancillary  pieces. You\u2019ll see this on the link above but some products that  Smartsheet sells Connectors for include Adobe Creative Cloud, Microsoft  Dynamics 365, Salesforce, Jira Software, Slack, and Skype just to name a  few.\n\nI think that being able to  sell these Connectors as ancillary pieces to the Smartsheet user  experience is so beneficial to Smartsheet because a lot of these  companies that people may perceive as \u201cSmartsheet competitors\u201d actually  become a piece of the Smartsheet platform and can be sold by Smartsheet  as a supplemental revenue stream. This neutral angle that Smartsheet is  able to come from by selling Connectors to their perceived \u201ccompetitors\u201d  reminds me a little bit of how Roku (ROKU) is able to earn revenue off  of selling a Netflix subscription on their platform. I think just the  fact that all these big companies like Adobe, Jira, Salesforce, etc.  allow their products to be integrated into Smartsheet shows that there  is a high value proposition in the Smartsheet platform and that they  would risk alienating their customers if they didn\u2019t allow for their  products to be integrated with Smartsheet.\n\nOn  top of the Connectors to third party vendors that Smartsheet is able to  sell, Smartsheet is also able to sell upgrades to their own internal  plug-ins. Smartsheet has some impressive proprietary plug-ins they can  sell to their customers. For example, in May 2019, Smartsheet acquired  10,000ft which augmented their product portfolio by providing resource  allocation and planning. The name \u201c10,000ft\u201d is meant to be analogous to  having a high level view of your company and all resources available  within your company and how to deploy them.\n\nAlso,  in September 2020, Smartsheet acquired Brandfolder, Inc. which provides  a centralized platform to organize, discover, control, distribute, and  measure all forms of digital content. Combining Brandfolder capabilities  with Smartsheet allows them to create dynamic solutions that manage  workflows around content and collaboration. This goes back to what I  said earlier in the article about how my girlfriend had mentioned that  her company\u2019s marketing team was \u201creally excited about Smartsheet  because it makes their job way easier and more enjoyable.\u201d She told me  that before Smartsheet, her company\u2019s marketing team had to constantly  hunt down members of the creative team (photographers, graphic  designers) to receive the latest photos, videos, and digital designs  they were working on. She said it was a big pain for them trying to  share this content over email and SharePoint. Now, all of the content is  inside of Smartsheet and the marketing team can access it at any time.  They can leave comments on the content, route to appropriate individuals  for approvals, and have better insight into the status of all digital  content that is being worked on. The acquisition of Brandfolder is  really what allows Smartsheet to stand out in this department.\n\nNobody  really talks about it, but digital content is so important these days  for companies in terms of controlling their brand image, putting out  quality advertisements, and presenting their product in as positive of a  light as possible. The fact that Smartsheet has a strong proprietary  plug-in for this with Brandfolder is very promising. During Smartsheet\u2019s  FY21 Engage Customer Conference, Anna Griffin, Smartsheet Chief  Marketing Officer said that the global annual marketing spend is $500B  for companies around the world. She said the role of the marketing  department is changing from sole content creator to Editor in Chief. All  kinds of teams within companies these days are putting out content that  effects the company\u2019s brand. Sales is running social media campaigns,  product marketing is putting out blog posts and podcasts, and R&amp;D is  teasing new product experiences in app. It can get really difficult for  the company\u2019s Marketing/Branding team to stay on top of all this  without a centralized digital content collaboration platform like  Brandfolder in Smartsheet. This is just one reason why I think  Smartsheet has a lot of growth opportunities in the future.\n\nAs  you can see, Smartsheet has a lot to offer to companies with their core  CWM platform, the Connectors they can sell, and the internal upgrades  available such as 10,000ft and Brandfolder. On top of that, Smartsheet  also provides WorkApps, a proprietary no-code platform that empowers  users to build intuitive web and mobile applications that streamline  business and simplify collaboration. There are so many instances within  companies where an app needs to be built to streamline a workflow.  Traditionally, companies need to engage their IT departments and the  coders that sit within these departments to build these apps. This  places a lot of strain on IT departments and takes away time they can be  spending on more complex/mission critical projects. Mark Mader is aware  of this and thus is heavily pushing no-code as a solution for companies  now and in the future. He believes that everyday non-coder employees  know their jobs/workflows best and thus if you empower them to build  their own apps with a no-code platform they will produce better and more  relevant apps to help get work done than an IT department employee who  doesn\u2019t even do the job that the app is being built for. Also, he  believes this will reduce strain on IT departments and allow them to  focus on more complex and mission critical projects.\n\nHere  is a quote from the Director of Sales (Hina Patel) at a Smartsheet  customer, Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO): \u201cI have been waiting for a solution like  WorkApps that can give us quick and easy access to the content we need,  when and where we need it,\u201d said Hina Patel, Director of Sales  Operations at Cisco. \u201cThe ability to take our Smartsheet assets, along  with other tools we use, and package an entire solution in an intuitive  app will make it even easier to drive active participation from everyone  involved in the process, no matter their role.\u201d As you can see, the  value proposition of WorkApps and the Smartsheet platform appears to be  high.\n\nLastly, Smartsheet also  generates revenue from Professional Services which is essentially  providing training and customized consulting to Smartsheet customers  that want to get more out of the Smartsheet platform. In the most recent  quarter, Q3 FY21, Professional Services accounted for 8.2% of revenue.  Here is the breakout from the most recent quarter:\n\nSubscription revenue = $90,890M for 91.8% of total revenue\n\nProfessional services revenue = $8,043M for 8.2% of total revenue\n\nThis  is the end of my first article about Smartsheet.

        "selftext": "**TL:DR is at the bottom**\n\nHello, welcome to my second deep dive write up.\n\nMy  name\u2019s Mark and I\u2019m an accountant with a passion for investing. About  two years ago, I used to work as an auditor at a public accounting firm  and have been behind the scenes at many different publicly traded and  privately held companies in the U.S. My goal is to bring my unique  perspective from that past experience, my current experience working in a  new role at a large corporation, and my understanding of accounting to  help break down some of the most exciting growth stocks on the market  today.\n\nI\u2019m a long-term investor. I  am focused on finding great companies and holding them for a long time.  I\u2019m willing to endure volatility, crazy price drops, and everything  that comes with this approach as long as the facts that led me to  originally invest and believe in that company have not changed. If you  want to learn more about this approach. I recommend reading the book  \u201c100 Baggers\u201d by Chris Mayer.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nI\u2019m  excited to share with you all my stock pick for this month, Smartsheet.  I\u2019m always looking for investment ideas. I run stock screeners with  different criteria (mostly focused on revenue growth), scan Twitter,  talk to professionals in different industries, and try to observe what  products or services are getting popular with my friends and family. One  of the best investment decisions I\u2019ve made to date came after I talked  to my friend about a drink he was drinking on the golf course. Shout out  to you Celsius (CELH)! With that being said, you never know where your  next good investment idea is going to come from.\n\nIn  the case of Smartsheet, I became aware of the company through a stock  screener. I was drawn to the relatively small market cap ($8.6B), strong  revenue growth (roughly 35%), and the fact that it\u2019s a subscription  business model (SaaS). Once I became aware of these facts, it cued me to  take a deeper dive. The more I learned about Smartsheet, the more I  liked. Management talks a lot about empowering people and that really  struck a chord with me. In different roles I\u2019ve had as a teacher, tutor,  and supervisor, I\u2019ve always found empowering people to be one of the  most important keys to success. I will touch on this more later in the  write up.\n\nAnother positive signal I  got about Smartsheet came unexpectedly one evening. I was sitting in  the kitchen and my girlfriend was cooking dinner. I was watching an  interview on my phone with Mark Mader, the CEO of Smartsheet. My  girlfriend overheard the word \u201cSmartsheet\u201d mentioned in the video and  said \u201cAre they talking about the Smartsheet with the blue check mark?\u201d. I  had to Google their logo but yes, it turns out we were thinking about  the same Smartsheet. I asked her how she knew about it. She said \u201cMy  company just transitioned all of our work onto Smartsheet. I really love  it. Our marketing department is really excited about it because it  makes their job way easier and more enjoyable.\u201d Hearing this just  motivated me to learn more about Smartsheet.\n\n**The Thesis Statement**\n\nFor  every stock pick I make, I want to provide a quick thesis statement  that can serve as a reminder for why I\u2019m buying and holding that stock  for the long term. I\u2019ll always aim to make it just a few sentences long  so it can easily be remembered and internalized. This helps during times  when the price may sporadically drop and you need to remember why  you\u2019re holding this position.\n\nThe thesis statement I have come up with for Smartsheet is as follows:\n\n*\u201cSmartsheet:  A leader in collaborative work management (CWM) software. As the global  workforce becomes more decentralized through remote work, managers and  executives now more than ever need a tool to digitally consolidate their  teams, projects and deadlines. Smartsheet is that tool and is  innovating to offer businesses even more ways to get the most out of  their teams.\u201d*\n\nI think this  thesis statement really captures the essence of what Smartsheet does. If  you go to Smartsheet\u2019s website and look at the \u201cAbout\u201d page, you will  find their \u201cAbout\u201d statement which says \u201cSmartsheet is the enterprise  platform for dynamic work that aligns people and technology so your  entire business can move faster, drive innovation, and achieve more.\u201d  Notice how their statement emphasizes helping businesses move faster,  drive innovation, and achieve more.\n\nIn  my thesis statement, I mention that Smartsheet is a leader in the CWM  software space. But how do I know this? Well, a highly reputable  independent research firm named Forrester conducted a study on the CWM  space based off different criteria including collaboration, enterprise  capabilities, UI/user experience, planned enhancements and number of  customers just to name a few of the factors considered. I put the  companies that were identified from the study in the order of their  ranking below. As you can see, Smartsheet is firmly planted as a leader  in the space at 2nd place. Let\u2019s use our common sense for a second. At  the beginning stages of a remote work revolution, do we want to invest  in an up and coming SaaS company that focuses on providing firms with  resources to digitally manage their teams, digitally manage  work/projects, and digitally collaborate to get work done? I think the  answer should be a resounding yes. But what about these other companies  on the list. Let\u2019s break them down 1 by 1:\n\n* Workfront  was recently bought by Adobe. If you want to invest in Workfront, you\u2019d  have to invest in the much larger company of Adobe. It wouldn\u2019t be a  pure play investment into the CWM space.\n* Smartsheet is 2nd and of course, they are public :)\n* Wrike is private\n* ServiceNow  \u2013 CWM is just one small piece of their total      offerings. Investing  here would not be a pure play into the CWM space.  Also, the company is  already quite large ($106B market cap)\n* Asana  is public but just IPO\u2019d on 9/30/20 about 3 months ago. We don\u2019t have  much data to track their performance as a      publicly traded company.  Furthermore, although they actually would be a pure play investment into  the CWM space, they\u2019re not a leader and rank behind Smartsheet in  several of Forrester\u2019s categories. Why invest in the 2nd best when you  can invest in the best?\n* Monday.com is private\n* Microsoft \u2013 CWM is just one small piece of their total offerings. Investing here would not be a pure play into the CWM space.\n* Atlassian  \u2013 This company does primarily focus on CWM but I have a couple problems  with them as an investment. 1) They\u2019re ranked way beneath Smartsheet.  2) They\u2019re already too big for me to confidently say they can 10x  (market cap already $58B).\n\nNow  that we\u2019ve established that Smartsheet is a leader in the CWM space and  that they\u2019re arguably the best publicly available pure-play investment  in this space let\u2019s understand why this is important. Other than the  obvious reason that we\u2019re in the beginning stages of a remote work  revolution, why is this important?\n\nWell,  let\u2019s take a look at this quote from Mark Mader, Smartsheet CEO, during  the last earnings call (Q3 FY21) that occurred on December 7th, 2020:\n\n\u201cLeaders  are recognizing they need to shift more workloads to asynchronous work,  work that is documented, automated, tracked with dashboards, and where  priorities are clearly defined.

Smartsheet is  ideally suited to help enterprises work more asynchronously to derive  the benefits from doing so.\u201d\n\nKey word here: Asynchronous. Asynchronous communication is different from Synchronous communication.

The name \u201c10,000ft\u201d is meant to be analogous to  having a high level view of your company and all resources available  within your company and how to deploy them.\n\nAlso,  in September 2020, Smartsheet acquired Brandfolder, Inc. which provides  a centralized platform to organize, discover, control, distribute, and  measure all forms of digital content. Combining Brandfolder capabilities  with Smartsheet allows them to create dynamic solutions that manage  workflows around content and collaboration. This goes back to what I  said earlier in the article about how my girlfriend had mentioned that  her company\u2019s marketing team was \u201creally excited about Smartsheet  because it makes their job way easier and more enjoyable.\u201d She told me  that before Smartsheet, her company\u2019s marketing team had to constantly  hunt down members of the creative team (photographers, graphic  designers) to receive the latest photos, videos, and digital designs  they were working on. She said it was a big pain for them trying to  share this content over email and SharePoint. Now, all of the content is  inside of Smartsheet and the marketing team can access it at any time.  They can leave comments on the content, route to appropriate individuals  for approvals, and have better insight into the status of all digital  content that is being worked on. The acquisition of Brandfolder is  really what allows Smartsheet to stand out in this department.\n\nNobody  really talks about it, but digital content is so important these days  for companies in terms of controlling their brand image, putting out  quality advertisements, and presenting their product in as positive of a  light as possible. The fact that Smartsheet has a strong proprietary  plug-in for this with Brandfolder is very promising. During Smartsheet\u2019s  FY21 Engage Customer Conference, Anna Griffin, Smartsheet Chief  Marketing Officer said that the global annual marketing spend is $500B  for companies around the world. She said the role of the marketing  department is changing from sole content creator to Editor in Chief. All  kinds of teams within companies these days are putting out content that  effects the company\u2019s brand. Sales is running social media campaigns,  product marketing is putting out blog posts and podcasts, and R&amp;D is  teasing new product experiences in app. It can get really difficult for  the company\u2019s Marketing/Branding team to stay on top of all this  without a centralized digital content collaboration platform like  Brandfolder in Smartsheet. This is just one reason why I think  Smartsheet has a lot of growth opportunities in the future.\n\nAs  you can see, Smartsheet has a lot to offer to companies with their core  CWM platform, the Connectors they can sell, and the internal upgrades  available such as 10,000ft and Brandfolder. On top of that, Smartsheet  also provides WorkApps, a proprietary no-code platform that empowers  users to build intuitive web and mobile applications that streamline  business and simplify collaboration. There are so many instances within  companies where an app needs to be built to streamline a workflow.  Traditionally, companies need to engage their IT departments and the  coders that sit within these departments to build these apps. This  places a lot of strain on IT departments and takes away time they can be  spending on more complex/mission critical projects. Mark Mader is aware  of this and thus is heavily pushing no-code as a solution for companies  now and in the future. He believes that everyday non-coder employees  know their jobs/workflows best and thus if you empower them to build  their own apps with a no-code platform they will produce better and more  relevant apps to help get work done than an IT department employee who  doesn\u2019t even do the job that the app is being built for. Also, he  believes this will reduce strain on IT departments and allow them to  focus on more complex and mission critical projects.\n\nHere  is a quote from the Director of Sales (Hina Patel) at a Smartsheet  customer, Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO): \u201cI have been waiting for a solution like  WorkApps that can give us quick and easy access to the content we need,  when and where we need it,\u201d said Hina Patel, Director of Sales  Operations at Cisco. \u201cThe ability to take our Smartsheet assets, along  with other tools we use, and package an entire solution in an intuitive  app will make it even easier to drive active participation from everyone  involved in the process, no matter their role.\u201d As you can see, the  value proposition of WorkApps and the Smartsheet platform appears to be  high.\n\nLastly, Smartsheet also  generates revenue from Professional Services which is essentially  providing training and customized consulting to Smartsheet customers  that want to get more out of the Smartsheet platform. In the most recent  quarter, Q3 FY21, Professional Services accounted for 8.2% of revenue.  Here is the breakout from the most recent quarter:\n\nSubscription revenue = $90,890M for 91.8% of total revenue\n\nProfessional services revenue = $8,043M for 8.2% of total revenue\n\nThis  is the end of my first article about Smartsheet.

        "selftext": "**TL:DR is at the bottom**\n\nHello, welcome to my second deep dive write up.\n\nMy  name\u2019s Mark and I\u2019m an accountant with a passion for investing. About  two years ago, I used to work as an auditor at a public accounting firm  and have been behind the scenes at many different publicly traded and  privately held companies in the U.S. My goal is to bring my unique  perspective from that past experience, my current experience working in a  new role at a large corporation, and my understanding of accounting to  help break down some of the most exciting growth stocks on the market  today.\n\nI\u2019m a long-term investor. I  am focused on finding great companies and holding them for a long time.  I\u2019m willing to endure volatility, crazy price drops, and everything  that comes with this approach as long as the facts that led me to  originally invest and believe in that company have not changed. If you  want to learn more about this approach. I recommend reading the book  \u201c100 Baggers\u201d by Chris Mayer.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nI\u2019m  excited to share with you all my stock pick for this month, Smartsheet.  I\u2019m always looking for investment ideas. I run stock screeners with  different criteria (mostly focused on revenue growth), scan Twitter,  talk to professionals in different industries, and try to observe what  products or services are getting popular with my friends and family. One  of the best investment decisions I\u2019ve made to date came after I talked  to my friend about a drink he was drinking on the golf course. Shout out  to you Celsius (CELH)! With that being said, you never know where your  next good investment idea is going to come from.\n\nIn  the case of Smartsheet, I became aware of the company through a stock  screener. I was drawn to the relatively small market cap ($8.6B), strong  revenue growth (roughly 35%), and the fact that it\u2019s a subscription  business model (SaaS). Once I became aware of these facts, it cued me to  take a deeper dive. The more I learned about Smartsheet, the more I  liked. Management talks a lot about empowering people and that really  struck a chord with me. In different roles I\u2019ve had as a teacher, tutor,  and supervisor, I\u2019ve always found empowering people to be one of the  most important keys to success. I will touch on this more later in the  write up.\n\nAnother positive signal I  got about Smartsheet came unexpectedly one evening. I was sitting in  the kitchen and my girlfriend was cooking dinner. I was watching an  interview on my phone with Mark Mader, the CEO of Smartsheet. My  girlfriend overheard the word \u201cSmartsheet\u201d mentioned in the video and  said \u201cAre they talking about the Smartsheet with the blue check mark?\u201d. I  had to Google their logo but yes, it turns out we were thinking about  the same Smartsheet. I asked her how she knew about it. She said \u201cMy  company just transitioned all of our work onto Smartsheet. I really love  it. Our marketing department is really excited about it because it  makes their job way easier and more enjoyable.\u201d Hearing this just  motivated me to learn more about Smartsheet.\n\n**The Thesis Statement**\n\nFor  every stock pick I make, I want to provide a quick thesis statement  that can serve as a reminder for why I\u2019m buying and holding that stock  for the long term. I\u2019ll always aim to make it just a few sentences long  so it can easily be remembered and internalized. This helps during times  when the price may sporadically drop and you need to remember why  you\u2019re holding this position.\n\nThe thesis statement I have come up with for Smartsheet is as follows:\n\n*\u201cSmartsheet:  A leader in collaborative work management (CWM) software. As the global  workforce becomes more decentralized through remote work, managers and  executives now more than ever need a tool to digitally consolidate their  teams, projects and deadlines. Smartsheet is that tool and is  innovating to offer businesses even more ways to get the most out of  their teams.\u201d*\n\nI think this  thesis statement really captures the essence of what Smartsheet does. If  you go to Smartsheet\u2019s website and look at the \u201cAbout\u201d page, you will  find their \u201cAbout\u201d statement which says \u201cSmartsheet is the enterprise  platform for dynamic work that aligns people and technology so your  entire business can move faster, drive innovation, and achieve more.\u201d  Notice how their statement emphasizes helping businesses move faster,  drive innovation, and achieve more.\n\nIn  my thesis statement, I mention that Smartsheet is a leader in the CWM  software space. But how do I know this? Well, a highly reputable  independent research firm named Forrester conducted a study on the CWM  space based off different criteria including collaboration, enterprise  capabilities, UI/user experience, planned enhancements and number of  customers just to name a few of the factors considered. I put the  companies that were identified from the study in the order of their  ranking below. As you can see, Smartsheet is firmly planted as a leader  in the space at 2nd place. Let\u2019s use our common sense for a second. At  the beginning stages of a remote work revolution, do we want to invest  in an up and coming SaaS company that focuses on providing firms with  resources to digitally manage their teams, digitally manage  work/projects, and digitally collaborate to get work done? I think the  answer should be a resounding yes. But what about these other companies  on the list. Let\u2019s break them down 1 by 1:\n\n* Workfront  was recently bought by Adobe. If you want to invest in Workfront, you\u2019d  have to invest in the much larger company of Adobe. It wouldn\u2019t be a  pure play investment into the CWM space.\n* Smartsheet is 2nd and of course, they are public :)\n* Wrike is private\n* ServiceNow  \u2013 CWM is just one small piece of their total      offerings. Investing  here would not be a pure play into the CWM space.  Also, the company is  already quite large ($106B market cap)\n* Asana  is public but just IPO\u2019d on 9/30/20 about 3 months ago. We don\u2019t have  much data to track their performance as a      publicly traded company.  Furthermore, although they actually would be a pure play investment into  the CWM space, they\u2019re not a leader and rank behind Smartsheet in  several of Forrester\u2019s categories. Why invest in the 2nd best when you  can invest in the best?\n* Monday.com is private\n* Microsoft \u2013 CWM is just one small piece of their total offerings. Investing here would not be a pure play into the CWM space.\n* Atlassian  \u2013 This company does primarily focus on CWM but I have a couple problems  with them as an investment. 1) They\u2019re ranked way beneath Smartsheet.  2) They\u2019re already too big for me to confidently say they can 10x  (market cap already $58B).\n\nNow  that we\u2019ve established that Smartsheet is a leader in the CWM space and  that they\u2019re arguably the best publicly available pure-play investment  in this space let\u2019s understand why this is important. Other than the  obvious reason that we\u2019re in the beginning stages of a remote work  revolution, why is this important?\n\nWell,  let\u2019s take a look at this quote from Mark Mader, Smartsheet CEO, during  the last earnings call (Q3 FY21) that occurred on December 7th, 2020:\n\n\u201cLeaders  are recognizing they need to shift more workloads to asynchronous work,  work that is documented, automated, tracked with dashboards, and where  priorities are clearly defined. They understand that by empowering their  teams with no-code solutions that facilitate asynchronous work, cycle  times will be improved, a deeper sense of ownership will be created, and  prioritization and accountability will be insured. Smartsheet is  ideally suited to help enterprises work more asynchronously to derive  the benefits from doing so.\u201d\n\nKey word here: Asynchronous. Asynchronous communication is different from Synchronous communication. Here is the difference:\n\nAsynchronous: email, message boards, dashboards, etc.\n\nSynchronous: video conferencing, chat, audio calls, etc.\n\nAny  communication that doesn\u2019t require a real-time response can be  considered asynchronous, like the examples in the picture above.  Synchronous communication is any communication that happens in real  time, thereby allowing for immediate responses, see examples above. As  part of my research on Smartsheet, I read an E-Book that was written by  the original co-founders of Smartsheet, Mark Mader the current CEO and  Brent Frei who is no longer with the company. They wrote the E-Book in  2007 just a couple of years after the 2005 founding. The E-Book is  called \u201cThe Power of Done\u201d. The moral of the book is that Mark and Brent  noticed through their own experience, and through different research  studies on work place productivity, that the rise in technology in the  early 21st century was actually making employees less productive. This  is a quote from their E-Book:\n\n\u201cAccording  to Basex, a research firm focusing on the knowledge economy,  interruptions from email, cell phones, instant messaging, text messaging  and blogs eat up nearly 30 percent of each day; on an annualized basis,  this represents a loss of 28 billion hours for the entire U.S.  workforce, or a $588 billion cost to the American economy.\u201d\n\nThey  mention in their book that although there has been a lot of advances in  work technology such as email, word processing, and spreadsheets, there  hadn\u2019t at that time been any great applications created for teamwork  collaboration or task management. The fact that technology advances  helped the world create tools to enhance productivity but also deterred  productivity at the same time is what Mark and Brent referred to as the  productivity paradox. They wanted to do something about it and thus they  founded Smartsheet.\n\n**How Smartsheet makes money**\n\nAt  the very least, before you invest in a company, you better understand  how they make money. In Chris Mayers\u2019 excellent book, 100 Baggers, that I  mentioned above, he continually references top line revenue growth as  one of the main common indicators of a possible 100 Bagger. This isn\u2019t  to tell you that any stock I pick will be a 100 Bagger just because it  has great top line revenue growth, but if I am looking at a growth stock  to hold for the long term, revenue growth is one of the first things I  look at.\n\nBefore I talk about the  revenue streams of Smartsheet, I want to share a little bit about the  actual product that they sell to earn this revenue. Co-Founder/CEO Mark  Mader realized that a lot of work in the corporate world was being done  on spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel. However, he realized that these  spreadsheets were largely static and not necessarily used to their full  potential. He wanted to help people get more out of their use of  spreadsheets. As a result, we now have Smartsheets which is a cloud  based platform that can be accessed by all employees of the company no  matter where they are with live information about project statuses,  meeting times and work that is assigned to each employee just to name a  few uses. Users can choose their way of viewing this information with  different views such as calendar view, grid view, card view, and Gantt  view.\n\nThe idea is that by  enhancing the availability and quality of asynchronous information  available to all members of a team about the status of a project, the  tasks assigned, and the timelines, the less synchronous communication  will be needed which allows employees to spend more time doing what  they\u2019re hired to do \u2013 get work done. Think about how wasteful it is to  hire a highly talented engineer but then make him spend half his day  preparing for and doing status update meetings and hunting people down  to see where they\u2019re at with their assignments. What if all this  information was available for him, his managers, and his staff to see  within Smartsheet without having to bother each other and waste precious  work hours that could be used for coding, designing, and producing?  That\u2019s what Smartsheet looks to achieve.\n\nFor  Smartsheet, their means of making money is quite simple. As I mentioned  earlier, they are a Software as a Service (SaaS) company. Whenever you  see SaaS, that means subscription revenue and in my opinion that\u2019s a  very good thing. With a subscription business model, the revenue is  going to be recurring every year and that type of reliability (combined  with growth of course) is something you want as an investor.\n\nSmartsheet\u2019s  primary source of revenue is the sale of subscriptions to their  cloud-based Collaborative Work Management (CWM) platform. Customers and  potential customers begin their engagement with the Smartsheet platform  by either signing up for a free trial, purchasing a subscription on the  Smartsheet website, going through a sales rep, or they are exposed to  Smartsheet by collaborating with a Company/Individual that uses  Smartsheet.  For subscriptions, customers select the plan that meets  their needs and can begin using Smartsheet within minutes.\n\nSmartsheet  offers four subscription levels: Individual, Business, Enterprise, and  Premier, the pricing for which varies by the capabilities provided.  Customers can also purchase connectors, which provide data integration  and automation to third-party applications.\n\nThe  Connectors part of the business is something I find really interesting.  Basically, Smartsheet has made deals with most of the top work  productivity and communication software companies in the world to allow  their customers to use those applications within their Smartsheet user  interface. This helps position Smartsheet as the true \u201ccommand center\u201d  platform while the products of the other companies become ancillary  pieces. You\u2019ll see this on the link above but some products that  Smartsheet sells Connectors for include Adobe Creative Cloud, Microsoft  Dynamics 365, Salesforce, Jira Software, Slack, and Skype just to name a  few.\n\nI think that being able to  sell these Connectors as ancillary pieces to the Smartsheet user  experience is so beneficial to Smartsheet because a lot of these  companies that people may perceive as \u201cSmartsheet competitors\u201d actually  become a piece of the Smartsheet platform and can be sold by Smartsheet  as a supplemental revenue stream. This neutral angle that Smartsheet is  able to come from by selling Connectors to their perceived \u201ccompetitors\u201d  reminds me a little bit of how Roku (ROKU) is able to earn revenue off  of selling a Netflix subscription on their platform. I think just the  fact that all these big companies like Adobe, Jira, Salesforce, etc.  allow their products to be integrated into Smartsheet shows that there  is a high value proposition in the Smartsheet platform and that they  would risk alienating their customers if they didn\u2019t allow for their  products to be integrated with Smartsheet.\n\nOn  top of the Connectors to third party vendors that Smartsheet is able to  sell, Smartsheet is also able to sell upgrades to their own internal  plug-ins. Smartsheet has some impressive proprietary plug-ins they can  sell to their customers. For example, in May 2019, Smartsheet acquired  10,000ft which augmented their product portfolio by providing resource  allocation and planning. The name \u201c10,000ft\u201d is meant to be analogous to  having a high level view of your company and all resources available  within your company and how to deploy them.\n\nAlso,  in September 2020, Smartsheet acquired Brandfolder, Inc. which provides  a centralized platform to organize, discover, control, distribute, and  measure all forms of digital content. Combining Brandfolder capabilities  with Smartsheet allows them to create dynamic solutions that manage  workflows around content and collaboration.
