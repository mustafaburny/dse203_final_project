        "selftext": "I'm concerned about our entire financial system. As an example of this, I'll ask some questions here to induce people to respond with logical answers or maybe even more questions. How many people have been harmed by financial \"errors\" revolving any and all cases where a regulator has fined a defending company(Dc) such as RobingdaHood? \r  \n\r  \n400 fines have been issued by the SEC in 2021, but how much money has been paid by the defending company or by SEC towards restitution anytime money is stolen during these \"civil mistakes? Did it hurt Donald Trump? Did it hurt Joe Biden? Did it hurt Greta Thunberg? Did it hurt millions of retail investors only? Did it hurt the planet?! \r  \n\r  \nIf we assume these regulators such as SEC, CFPB(Consumer Financial Protection Bureau), and FINRA are getting paid $X,000,000,000 for total yearly fines, we should assume Dc robbed someone to afford to be able to pay  these fines or else what possible damage did they do in the first place? If you or me went into a thrift store and stole some air jordans worth $300 and then got arrested and had to pay the local court $100 in fines but didn't have to pay restitution; the shoes, we just made $200. Sounds like a profitable business to me! My point is, the Dc's of the world are continuing to \"make mistakes\" that rob most of the worlds population while paying \"bribes\" to the regulators or am I missing something that shows we are all being paid back \r  \nafter all brokers including Robinhood turns off the buy button, \r  \n\r  \nWhen the fines paid to the regulator is more than the restitution paid to the ones robbed, when SAC steals billions and then changes their name to Point72, when a young boy grows up in Bulgaria, \r  \n\r  \nWhen the banks that initiated the C to AAA loans \"The Big Short\" got paid millions in bonuses but the people that lost their houses got food stamps(2008), When Merril Lynch paid 100million for writing articles to the public to buy when they should have sold and sell when they should have bought(2002), when Enron(2001), when  Mizuho Financial Group  inflated credit rates FOUR YEARS AFTER 2008,  \r  \n\r  \nwhen Siemens used illegal schemes to win business in several different countries around the world and never lost any business, when  Goldman Sachs  was STILL using 2008 schemes to rob people in 2010 for millions, \r  \n\r  \nwhen UBS AG paid a $1,500,000,000 fine for  \"manipulating interbank lending rates,\" when Wells Fargo created millions of fake accounts using REAL social security numbers, when bank of America and other banks used \"creative\" math to obtain billions in overdraft fees paid by the poor who couldn't afford them(\\*when your account is closed with fines Dc gets a tax break), when  Bank of America paid $3.6 billion for  not disclosing billions of dollars worth of bonuses paid to Merrill Lynch employees AFTER 2008 after robing America, \r  \n\r  \nWhen  Wells Fargo &amp; Co, JP Morgan, and Bank of America paid $9.3 billion 5 years after 2008(did you know a single person whom received any payment from losing their house in 2008?)...  JP Morgan Chase paid $13 billion for their part(did you get any of that money?!),  \r  \n\r  \nWhen JP Morgan(2020 they are STILL in business, this is how you KNOW they are like oxygen for the rich) paid  950 million for manipulation of the precious metals market, \r  \nWhen  SAC Capital faced charges for insider trading to the tune of $1,800,000,000 with a B 12 years after they profited tremendously from \"Building 7 Charlie Vids\" and the list goes on and on and on where Dc's made HUGE mistakes that cost people their savings, their 401ks, their house, their jobs, their livelihood, their business, and some even their lives. All these things so bad for the general public are factual and MODS I'm willing to produce the evidence (found during a simple google search) or ban. I only have one real question for everyone, for you, for the president, for the apes, for the ape haters, for the rich whistleblowers(anyone ever met one or is it just Gary Gensler's friends getting the money? \"no facts for this but WTF\"), \r  \n\r  \nThe most important question might be Why are these Dc's still operating with obvious \"don't care about the planet or humans on it\" attitude after regulators clearly fined them for being criminals? A crime is a crime! This leads me to ask if you know what a tax credit is? Tax credits only help people that could afford something to begin with. They don't help the jobless(out of unemployment you're fkd.) If the goverment cares about the global warming or anyone actually getting these \"payments\" why would they care if you were poor or middle class etc? They chose to implement these credits, they chose to allow Robingdahood to IPO after forcing the world to sell as their only decision, and couldn't even exercise any other option. WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO after the person whom is suppose to protect the freedoms and people of this country outright defend the corporations over another human being... but seriously wat do we tards do?\r  \n\n\nTLDR; Financial institutions,  brokers, hedge funds are proven crooks per finra/sec fines and the regulators are simply there to get a cut of the money stolen while never removing any license or even reporting it to the department of justice. [https://worthly.com/news/15-biggest-sec-fines-history/](https://worthly.com/news/15-biggest-sec-fines-history/)\r  \n\n\nSome math for your discussion. The link I've provided equals fines of $45.597 billion in fines in just this one page. Did you get any of that money because I didn't? All the things I've mentioned is real money paid to real people but if NO ONE knows anyone that got the money other than winners like Mark Baum and Michael B, I don't think 1929 or the 1934 investment act or the crash of 1999 or the blatant robbery in 2008 was ever fixed in any way shape or form. Anyone care to post in the relevant places with a pic from wetdirtkurt's butthole pic before I shove my computer in my arse so no one can have it?  \nMods, I can produce gain/loss porn to prove I've been here since before Jan 28th goodbye buy button.

        "selftext": "Read until end: \n\nI wanted to tell this story because I figured some apes would find it amusing and to give a heads up to anyone still using Robinghood or margin. \n\nToday I received my first margin call liquidation. My balance was skimming the line and I was hoping it would bounce and it didn\u2019t. To begin, yes I am retarded but second, **do not let brokers exercise a margin call on you**. Get money in your account, cover that F***ing call or they **will** fuck you. They will not exercise their liquidation with any form of rational or ethical discretion and **will** make the worst sales possible to cost you the most amount of money possible.\n\n\nNow, for the story.\n\n\nToday at 10:38 a.m. Robbinghood liquidated 180 shares in my account netting me a $600 loss. \n\n\nAt the same time they handed me this loss, they could have instead exercised the decision to liquidate a different position of mine. A position which would have covered the same amount of margin due and only accounted for a total loss of $2. Not $2 per share but 4 shares (as opposed to 180) for a total $2 loss.\n\nI called customer service and asked them what the f*** made them decide that was an ethical way to liquidate. They agreed it was bad judgment, agreed they could correct it and then told me that despite both of these points they won\u2019t (I am dead serious).\n\nThe cherry on top? The stocks RobbingHood sold at a massive loss were RobbingHood shares. That\u2019s right. I took a chance on their shit company, they sucked and then penalized me for their suck. What a spit in the face.\n\nTo end on a positive note, I just liquidated my entire account and switched to WeBull closing my RH account, forever.

The current price $4.50 is HALF the lowest of the 12 analyst ratings ($9). They think it is an easy $7, so a quick 50+% upswing.\n\n2. The company has had amazing revenue growth and it\u2019s current price is being credited to a lockup expiration of 17 mil shares. However, this stock has mainly been double digits in price and it is unlikely any of the SPAC investors would sell for a 50+% loss when the company is projected to soar.\n\n3. The short interest is around 30% which is incredibly high. The stock is a potential short squeeze (per SeekingAlpha). \n\nI see great potential for this company as their market cap is 200x lower than Carvana which is dealing with potential legal and logistical issues related to title delegations.",

        "selftext": "With the COVID-19 pandemic upending life in every corner of the world and putting unwelcome pressure on people vulnerable to depression, suicide and addiction, there has never been a better time to consider new treatments for mental health challenges. One field gaining particularly rapid traction is psychedelics. Of course, substances such as LSD and magic mushrooms have been around for years. They are known for their \"mind-altering\" qualities, both positive and negative, but in many ways, the chemical properties of these compounds and their potential to benefit the brain are only just beginning to be understood.\n\nBright Minds Biosciences is a biotech company at the vanguard of this movement, developing the \"next generation\" of non-addictive psychedelic medicines to treat depression and other neurological conditions and aims to offer an alternative to today's standard treatments such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), of which the widely known Prozac and Citalopram are but two examples.\n\n\"There haven\u2019t really been any new ideas in the last 30 years or so,\" says Bright Minds Chief Executive Officer Ian McDonald, who added that while revolutionary when they emerged in the 1990s, SSRIs have not always been best for patient outcomes, as side effects can include weight gain and sexual dysfunction. SSRIs, he noted, might not work at all, or can even be problematic, for patients suffering from the most severe forms of depression, or people struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). McDonald is convinced that psychedelics is the most promising field for making progress over the next 20 or 30 years in psychiatric medicine, and that related treatments will help the people most deeply affected by such disorders.\n\nWith this in mind, Bright Minds has a portfolio of three patented mechanisms based on serotonin (5-HT) receptors that are being assessed for indications ranging from depression to chronic pain. And with $30 million raised to date, the company is fully funded for Phase 1 trials for two of its drugs, which are due to begin next year. Bright Minds aims to refine what could be seen as \"coarse\" substances and repurpose them. To do so, McDonald has assembled a top-notch team of scientists and researchers with extensive backgrounds in pharma and drug development.\n\nBright Minds aims to refine what could be seen as \"coarse\" substances and repurpose them. To do so, McDonald has assembled a top-notch team of scientists and researchers with extensive backgrounds in pharma and drug development. \n\nBright Minds Co-Founder Dr. Gideon Shapiro, for example, has over 100 patents to his name and is a leading commercial scientist creating novel psychedelics. He served as head of the Alzheimer chemistry group at Sandoz, the company first responsible for discovering LSD and marketing psilocybin, while Bright Minds' Chief Scientific Officer and organic chemist Dr. Alan Kozikowski is world-renowned for his work with psychoactive substances.\n\n\"We're not trying to reinvent the wheel,\" says McDonald. \u201cWe're taking compounds that already work and making them better. We're sanding down the rough edges and polishing them up. I'd say it's a much less risky approach than a lot of other biotechs who are doing a completely novel mechanism and where there are questions on efficacy.\" It is also worth highlighting that Bright Minds already has \"composition of matter\" patents covering all of its new chemical entity (NCE) portfolio, giving it a full monopoly over its drugs for 20 years. This approach is more akin to Big Pharma companies, which patent the molecules they invent.\n\nOlder drugs such as LSD and MDMA cannot be patented, and some companies simply pursue weaker patent strategies, according to McDonald. For example, they attempt to patent a method of production or the source of a compound. But these can easily be worked around by skilled chemists and may only offer an exclusivity period for five years, after which they become so-called generic drugs. A drug maker's profitability is at stake here. McDonald points out that potential revenue for a patented drug for depression, for example, could be between US$10,000 and $30,000 per patient per year compared to around $400 per year for a generic drug.\n\nIndeed, the global market potentially open to Bright Minds is enormous. Antidepressants alone are expected to be worth $16 billion a year by 2025. And McDonald says this figure was based on generic depression drugs. For a patented one, based on the number of patients multiplied by $20,000 a year, the figure reaches an eye-watering $600 billion.\n\nPeople who do well taking SSRIs will likely stick with them, McDonald concedes, but for that third of the patient population who do not, there is a potential market for alternatives of $200 billion. The Bright Minds portfolio is already garnering attention. The company is partnering with the US government\u2019s National Institutes of Health to test its drugs for epilepsy and chronic pain, not least to offer an alternative to opioid drugs in the latter case. McDonald says early findings have been encouraging. In August of this year, the company reported positive pre-clinical data for its BMB-101 candidate (invented by Dr. Kozikowski) in treating the rare form of childhood epilepsy called Dravet Syndrome. This non-psychedelic drug is also being indicated as an antipsychotic for Alzheimer's and to treat addiction disorders.\n\nBMB-101 will be heading into Phase 1 trials early in 2022, with two Phase 2 studies potentially following in the second half. The company also aims to run a Phase 2 trial for its psychedelic candidate (5-HT2A) for depression and PTSD in 2022, says McDonald. \"We are entering a very catalyst-rich period. We have a number of clinical trials in 2022 coming up within the next year,\" he adds. \n\nBright Minds appears to be a front-runner in this exciting new medical space and McDonald has the resources and team to see his plan through. \"We are really the leaders in this next generation of psychedelics, looking a step further I think than the other companies, and we have the team to do it \u2013 they've done it before, and we're all very excited to get these drugs in the clinic and closer to patients.\"\n\n**Link to the complete article-** [https://ca.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/967805/bright-minds-biosciences-a-vision-for-next-generation-psychedelic-medicines-to-treat-neurological-conditions-967805.html](https://ca.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/967805/bright-minds-biosciences-a-vision-for-next-generation-psychedelic-medicines-to-treat-neurological-conditions-967805.html)",

S&amp;P 500 futures gained 1.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 1.4%.\n*****\n&gt; The gains follow a Tuesday sell-off on Wall Street over fears about the new omicron Covid variant and the Federal Reserve mulling a quicker-than-planned exit from its easy monetary policy.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury yields also moved notably higher, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury note most recently back near 1.5% after falling 8 basis points Tuesday to 1.45% on fears that the pandemic would stifle economic growth.\n*****\n&gt; Merck led gainers on the S&amp;P 500, rising 4% in premarket trading a day after its Covid treatment pill received approval from the Food and Drug Administration, though by a narrow 13-10 margin.\n*****\n&gt; Energy shares also posted sharp gains, with Occidental Petroleum up 3.4% as West Texas Intermediate prices climbed more than 4% to nearly $69 a barrel.\n*****\n&gt; Elsewhere in early trading, stocks associated with the economic reopening also posted strong gains. Carnival was up 2.9%, Wynn Resorts gained 2.6% and Hilton Worldwide saw a 2.8% gain.\n*****\n&gt; The moves came a day after the Dow lost more than 650 points, the S&amp;P 500 shed 1.9% and the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite dipped 1.6%. The small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 tumbled 1.9% as cyclical names dragged on the markets.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOur sense is that the recent selloff is a longer-term buying opportunity. However, investors that want to avoid a potential big drawdown (while giving up some potential upside) may want to wait until the [Fed\u2019s] Dec. 15 meeting,\u201d Wolfe Research strategist Chris Senyek said in a note to clients.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell jolted markets after he said the central bank is expected to discuss speeding up the taper of its minimum $120 billion a month bond-buying program. Despite the potential disruption of omicron, the Fed chief said he thinks reducing the pace of monthly bond buys can move quicker than the $15 billion-a-month schedule announced earlier this month.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAt this point, the economy is very strong and inflationary pressures are higher, and it is therefore appropriate in my view to consider wrapping up the taper of our asset purchases ... perhaps a few months sooner,\u201d Powell said. \u201cI expect that we will discuss that at our upcoming meeting.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Goldman Sachs said it projects the Fed will double the pace to $30 billion a month and enact its first rate hike of the pandemic era in June.\n*****\n&gt; The major averages have seen several volatile sessions, starting last Friday when the Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced its worst day since October 2020. Stocks rebounded on Monday, only to turn downward again on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; Wednesday marks the first trading day of the final month of 2021.\n*****\n&gt; Expediting the removal of the Fed\u2019s easy policies tells investors that the central bank is focusing on addressing inflation, instead of new threats from the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMarkets appear to be having trouble digesting the combo of elevated uncertainty around the impact of the Omicron variant and a hawkish Fed pivot in the context of persistently elevated inflation,\u201d said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.\n*****\n&gt; The new Covid variant, first detected in South Africa, has now been identified in more than a dozen countries, causing many to restrict travel. Denting sentiment on Tuesday, the Moderna CEO told the Financial Times that he expects existing vaccines to be less effective against the new variant.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks wrapped up a volatile month of trading on Tuesday. The Dow lost 3.7% for its second month of losses in three. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.25% in November. The Russell 2000 shed 4.3% in November, its worst month since March 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Still, the major averages are up solidly for the year. The Dow is up 12.7% and the S&amp;P 500 is up 21.6% in 2021. The Nasdaq Composite is up an impressive 20.6% this year.\n*****\n&gt; ADP\u2019s private payroll data for November showed 534,000 jobs added in November, above expectations of 506,000\n*****\n&gt; On Wednesday, investors will be evaluating updates on the omicron variant, as well as some key economic reports. November\u2019s Manufacturing PMI, ISM Manufacturing print and October\u2019s construction spending are set to release on Wednesday morning.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/8Kedb0c.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CZnVYrP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/XAbNcjb.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Jml9Z5I.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/5KwRD2M.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($LI $CRM $CRWD $DOCU $SNOW $AI $DG $MRVL $ZS $ASAN $OKTA $ULTA $AMBA $NTAP $SIG $EXPR $HPE $BBW $BQ $BNS $JKS $FRO $MOMO $HIBB $SPLK $SWBI $QH $RY $CHS $BZUN $FIVE $BOX $VERU $YJ $KR $CTRN $TD $VEEV $BIG $GMS $DOOO $CM $EMKR $PVH)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/5ocvp67.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($CRM $ZS $AMBA $NTAP $HPE $BBW $BOX $RY $EMKR $DOOO $GIII $REX $DCI $PDCO $GFS $AIP $VBNK $SDIG)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/lCtopUt.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/o7ET4fR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/odyatZm.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rIUTfTU.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/X0CaSOZ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/paTa9DS.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/6LhmSMe.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/NQh0VqW.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/lNszsgs.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/TQK2vhS.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/kZvQYzi.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/m6LPOsg.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* BYSI\n* REQ.X\n* VXRT\n* NIO\n* AAPL\n* MATIC.X\n* ATNF\n* AERC\n* OP\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/01/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-salesforce-allbirds-doordash-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Salesforce** \u2014 Shares of the software giant dropped more than 6% in premarket trading despite a better-than-expected third-quarter earnings report.

        "selftext": "New Feasibility Study Announced by U.S. Gold (USAU) at Their CK Gold Project Could Launch the Company to a New Level\n\n**U.S. Gold Corp. (NASDAQ: USAU)**\u00a0is a gold exploration and development company.\n\nCurrent price $11.14/share (+ 3.4% as of 1:00 P.M. EST 12-2-21)\n\nAfter closing at $10.80/share in Wednesday\u2019s session, USAU shares opened at $11.01 today. The shares reached $11.50 quickly and traded volume in the first 30 minutes was 33K shares.\n\nIn a\u00a0[press release today](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-gold-corp-provides-access-133000423.html), Mr. George Bee, the Company's President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, reminded us that the PFS assumes $1,625 per gold ounce and $3.25 per pound for copper, based on a weighted average of historic prices and consensus forward looking price (see PFS for a full explanation). Gold and copper prices today are around $1,800/ounce and $4.25/pound respectively.\n\nAlliance Global Partners, one of the analysts following USAU released the following statement and increased target price today \u201cIncreasing Target on Robust CK Gold Project PFS; Feasibility Study and Permitting On-Deck\u201d AGP further outlined their position:\n\nOn December 1, 2021, USAU announced a positive Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS) for its CK Gold Project in Wyoming. In our view, the PFS outlined a robust project featuring low-cost production of over 100,000 gold equivalent ounces per annum over a 10-year mine life. Given the project's production profile of over 100,000 ounces of gold per year, strategic location in the United States, manageable CapEx, and accelerated permitting timeline, we view the CK Project as an attractive asset that warrants development. Further, we note that much of the heavy lifting related to Feasibility level work has already been completed, which should accelerate the project's development timeline. As such, we are reiterating our Buy rating and\u00a0**increasing our price target to $25.00**\u00a0from $20.00 per share. Here is a link to the\u00a0[full analysts report](https://europac.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=384226a3-5f14-49c7-8061-bf580613cd8d&amp;mime=pdf&amp;co=Europac&amp;id=jsekelsky@allianceg.com&amp;source=mail).\n\n**The new feasibility Study is the biggest news, and potential catalyst I\u2019ve ever seen come from this company. I\u2019m keeping in mind that USAU has four gold mining projects and CK Gold is one of them with a Net Present Value of $323M. The company\u2019s market value is under $80M.**\n\nThis new\u00a0[information about the CK Gold Property](https://www.usgoldcorp.gold/news-media/press-releases/detail/142/u-s-gold-corp-announces-positive-prefeasibility-study)\u00a0establishes a clear path for a mining operation with a Net Present Value of $323M and an Internal Rate of Return at 39.4%. Those are substantial numbers to achieve for an initial investment of $221M.\n\nWe\u2019ve gotten some technical question about the prefeasibility report from our well-informed members. While\u00a0[the press release](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-gold-corp-announces-positive-141500367.html)\u00a0goes into substantial detail, we wanted to link the\u00a0[Technical Report Summary](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_f533b074cecd42b4e3eb4ca58d5307a2/usgoldcorp/db/332/2068/pdf/CK+Gold+SK-1300+PFS+TRS+Dec+2021.pdf)\u00a0provided by USAU as well. I believe any questions regarding the prefeasibility study can be addressed within the technical report. USAU has several geologists and technical advisors on board and while the company drilled the core samples, much of the data presented has been consolidated and verified by outside sources.\n\nThe possibilities for USAU now are encouraging and range from an inflow of money for a mining operation that leads to revenues and a substantial bottom line, to a potential exit to a larger gold miner.\n\n**original report below from 12-2-21 9:00 AM Eastern**\n\n**A just released feasibility study indicates huge potential gold reserves.**\n\nGood day everyone,\n\n**U.S. Gold Corp. (NASDAQ: USAU)**\u00a0is a gold exploration and development company.\n\nCurrent price $10.76/share (at market close 11-30-21)\n\nIt\u2019s been a while since we talked about a junior gold miner. We\u2019ve talked about USAU before, but it was in January of this year. I wanted to talk about them now to update you about events at the company and because turmoil in the economy can impact gold prices, driving them higher. Higher gold prices usually improve the value of gold miners at all levels.\n\n**Some considerations for USAU:**\n\n38% off 52-week high Copper &amp; gold prices are strong Tiny share structure Analysts indicate 68% to 150% potential upside Fresh PFS with great results\n\nI want to note that\u00a0[USAU shares](https://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=USAU)\u00a0have just broken through their 20 SMA, 50 SMA and 200 SMA of $10.24, $10.19, and $10.54 respectively. With a 52-week high of $17.40/share, a near term breakout may be indicated.\n\nGold is a traditional haven for investors that are uncertain of the near-term fortunes of the economy. I talked to you earlier about moves that the Fed is contemplating to tamp down inflation. Potentially discontinuing the purchase of treasuries and mortgage-backed securities along with the other weapon in the Fed arsenal, raising interest rates. These kinds of Fed actions are designed to slow the economy and may drive investors to increase their gold positions. That is good news for USAU.\n\nThe current price of gold is $1,787/ounce and the 2021 range has been $1,684 - $1,951/ounce.\n\nUSAU presents with a tiny share structure with only 7.09M shares outstanding and 6.76M shares in the float. Insiders hold 13.32% of the outstanding shares and institutions hold 11.79% which seems significant for a development stage company.\n\nThe company has a FYE of April 30th,\u00a0so they are operating in their Q3 right now. At the end of Q1 (July 31) the company reported cash of $10.7M\n\n8/20/2021 HC Wainwright Reiterated Rating Buy $15.504/8/2021 Alliance Global Lower Price Target Buy $20.00The consensus price target level from the analysts above is $17.75 indicating a possible upside of 65%.\n\nToday I want to outline the company\u2019s flagship property, the CK Gold Project located in Wyoming, just west of Cheyenne. The property comprises about 1,120 acres and is\u00a0**100% owned by U.S. Gold Corp.**\u00a0Here\u2019s a link to a\u00a0[short video](https://www.usgoldcorp.gold/properties/ck-gold-project/overview)\u00a0about the project.\n\n12-1-21: USAU\u00a0[just released news](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-gold-corp-announces-positive-141500367.html)\u00a0that it has completed the prefeasibility study (PFS) for the Company's CK Gold Project and has published its SK-1300 Technical Report Summary. A pre-feasibility study determines whether a probable mineral reserve is economically viable and determines whether the reserve can be economically mined. Here are the highlights:\n\nMineral Resources \u2013 1.58 million gold equivalent (\"AuEq\") ounces of Measured and Indicated (M+I) Resources\n\nMineral Reserves \u2013 1.44 million AuEq ounces of Proven and Probable (P1 and P2) Reserves\n\n10-year Mine Life at 20,000 short tons per day process rate\n\nInitial Capital: $221 million\n\nRobust Economics \u2013 39.4% IRR before tax and 33.7% IRR after tax\n\nUpside Potential\n\nPermitting and Development\n\nDevelopment Plan Progress Highlights:\n\n2021 Field Season \u2013 a successful field season concluded November 2021\n\nOngoing Test-Work \u2013 geochemical, metallurgical for completion in Q1 2022\n\nInterviewing FS and EPCM engineering firm candidates, with RFPs to be submitted\n\nContinued Social and Wyoming Government Outreach\n\nI will do the math. At today\u2019s gold price, the projected gold equivalent reserves at the CK project could be worth as much as $2.6 Billion. Not bad for a company whose market value is only $78M.\n\nEd Karr, the company CEO said, \"Considering the findings of the PFS study in the context of today's metal prices, we seem to be on the precipice of realizing exceptional value from a project whose time has come. We also are intrigued by the upside potential the CK Gold Project holds as we look at the potential value of the aggregate the project can produce at a time when development in the vicinity of the project is increasing.\"\n\nMake no mistake, this is a huge development that may result in a major catalyst for the company\u2019s value. I will have more to add to this report tomorrow.\n\n[Privacy policy and disclaimer](https://mailchi.mp/tradersnewssource/what-type-of-stocks-will-thrive-in-this-environment-650036?e=[UNIQID])",

        "selftext": "A New Metric to analyze and predict the future price of stocks is here, whether we like it or not. I am talking about quantified social media sentiments. The more I learn about the correlation of sentiments vs price, the more I see traditional stock signals as insufficient for determining the stock movement, and how insight into social sentiment is critical.\n\n**The core principle underlying technical analysis is that the market price reflects all available information that could impact a market**. But is this true now? I would argue that nowadays, the price of a particular stock also reflects the social media sentiments. For e.g., AMC and GME stocks broke all fundamentals and technicals that the analysts believed to be true and depicted the price what the market sentiments provided.\n\nOver the last year, we had significant growth in terms of retail investors both in stocks and crypto -- now adding up to over 30% of the investor market. Most of them, like myself, joined the market with very limited knowledge on analysis tools. Most of them look for trends on social media to make gains and cut losses. Why? Because it saves time. Following someone else\u2019s footsteps seems a comfortable signal that moves the price of the stock. So then why do the analysis tools still exclude these signals?\n\nAs a curious follower of the market trends, I would say that it is time to come up with a new playbook for stock market analysis. A playbook that breaks down the analysis into three main areas:\n\n1\\] Technical Analysis \n\n2\\] Fundamental Analysis \n\n3\\] Social Signals \n\nand then brings it together to provide insights on the stocks. \n\nCurrently, I have not seen many platforms offer all these services. But some platforms like public, daizy, swaggstocks and alphatrend have started to work around the community aspect of investing. Will the future of fintech products evolve to include social media sentiments as one of the analysis tools is something that we will have to wait and see. But for now, based on what I am reading, it sure seems like we are headed to a future where social media sentiments would be more of a need than a nice-to-know feature.",

        "selftext": "Seems this week has shaken a few investor so thought it would be a great time to review \"How to decide on your asset allocation\".\n\n**What is asset allocation?**  It is you mix of:  Stocks/ bonds/ cash/ alternative investments.  Each of those are \"super asset\" classes.  That means they are fundamentally different then another one when it comes to return/ risk/ correlation coefficients (how one zigs when others zag).  \n\n**Why is it important?**  Asset allocation is how one controls risk in your portfolio.  Early on folks spend a lot of time thinking about return, but as you learn about investing (via books/ financial theory and frankly your own experience) you realize focusing on controlling risk is MORE important.  It is more under control unlike returns..  There was a landmark paper published several years ago basically stating, 90% of all short term volatility is related to asset allocation.  It is one of the fundamental ways an investor has to limit volatility (standard deviation of returns).\n\nThis decision on asset allocation is by FAR the single most important decision an investor will make.  Harry Markowitz (father on modern portfolio theory) won a Nobel Prize in 1994 based on his work on the matter.  So yeah it is pretty important.\n\nSo lets get started...\n\nA lot of the below is an amalgam of different folk's opinions.  A good spot to start comes from:  Larry Swedroe (well known financial author) wrote (paraphrasing):  Your asset allocation is decided by one's willingness, ability, and need to take risk.  \n\n**Willingness** to take risk is based on how much your stomach can handle volatility (market going down). Easy rule of thumb is to assume your portfolio can drop in any given year 50% by the amount dedicated to stocks. For example, if you have a $100k portfolio and are 80/20 (stocks/ bonds) assume you can lose 40% in an given year. So if this is you, don't be surprised if your portfolio drops to $60k (loss of 40k) at any given year.  If that is TOO MUCH for you to handle you need to dial down the amount dedicated to stocks.\n\n**Need** to take risk is how much return you need to get to your \"number\". That is hard for any young investor to figure out as they are YEARS away from retirement. If you are closer to retirement look through your last couple of years of spending and figure out your \"number\" per year needed. Then, take that number and subtract out SS+ any pensions+ any annuity from your \"number\". That delta needs to be covered by your personal investments. Then, figure out how much you will need to return so you can take out 4%/ year to meet that \"number\". Trinity study give a basis of the 4% which would have worked as well through the worst stretch in U.S. history (70's) so good enough to use.\n\n**Ability** to take risk is all based on your:  Need for liquidity while that money is invested, stability of job. and time horizon. \n\n1.  Liquidity means only invest money you don't need until the end of the time horizon you are investing. If you are getting married, buying house, saving for retirement then EACH should have a different asset allocation as they all have different time horizons.  This is why it simply does NOT matter what happens until that time horizon is up since you don't need access to that money until then end of that specific time horizon. \n2. Stability of job is a BIG one that no one thinks about. I would say there are more folks with the stomach to handle volatility then there are folks who have a stable job that would allow them to handle the volatility. If the market crashes folks may be okay with losing large sums of money during a bear market, BUT the issue is businesses usually contract during these times which means you get fired at the same time. That means you have to dip into your investments to live off the SAME time your investments are at lows. This can be protected by having a emergency fund of 6M- 1yr if one has a unstable career IF you are going to be heavy in stocks or 3-6m EF for more balanced asset allocations.  Unless you are a doctor, tenured teacher, government worker, etc.. you will likely get fired at some point in your life (usually at the worst possible time) so be prepared for it with your investing plan ahead of time. \n3. Time horizon... below is a quick table for the MAX asset allocation based on different time horizons... Money needed in...\n\n0-2 years: 100% cash\n\n2-4: 20/80 (s/b)\n\n4-6: 40/60\n\n6-8: 60/40\n\n8-10: 80/20\n\n10+ years: 100% stocks\n\nI Hope some of this helps in figuring out a more systematic way to decide how much risk (usually equity risk) one should take on based on their own circumstance.",

Coinbase, Hood, Seatgeek, Acorns were some big public ones. some others are still private that I've actually heard of; Rally (NFT Marketplace), Dutchie, Postmates, Alt (Sports cards Marketplace)), Pieology, and the Recount.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**OUR FOCUS**\n\nThe below represent examples of our thematic areas of focus, by no means exclusively, many of which are experiencing accelerated digital transformation:\n\n\u2022**Sports**: We watch, consume and participate in sports largely in the same ways we have for decades, and all that has really changed is the screen size. Few sectors can match that claim. Generational change and technology have long knocked on the door of sports transformation and are now breaking through. Personalized streaming, augmented reality, e-sports, sports betting, biometric access, omnichannel events blurring in-home and live experiences, AI-powered analytical tools and block-chain applications are just a few examples of more bespoke approaches to engaging and retaining consumers that seek a differentiated experience. We believe this is an exciting moment for this massive global industry and one that will lend itself to incredible acquisition opportunities.\n\n\u2022**Health &amp; Wellness**: With the COVID-19 pandemic rapidly accelerating shifts towards telehealth in all categories, individuals have shown they want to be led by instructors, doctors, and subject matter experts on almost every choice they make, and they expect the same frictionless ease and connectivity they experience in other categories. Just as mobile devices and cloud computing technology have empowered on-demand transactions in sectors like video (Netflix), music (Spotify), transportation (Uber), sports betting (FanDuel, DraftKings), and insurance (Lemonade), mental health (Calm, Headspace), digital health (Peloton, Oura, Whoop- a Thirty Five and LionTree investment), and wellness (Noom) are the next industries to be completely digitized. The traditional healthcare vertical is poised for digital transformation as well, with growing levels of investment and maturation in the space, from the IPOs of Oscar Health (LionTree acted as co-manager and investor), GoodRx and Amwell, to the merger of Teladoc and Livongo, to the acquisition of hims &amp; hers by the Oaktree Acquisition Corp SPAC in a go-public transaction (LionTree advised hims &amp; hers management).8\n\n\u2022**Food Tech &amp; Supply**: Increased focus on personal health, animal welfare, and climate change have driven companies to harness technology to create more sustainable food products and production processes. Consumers want better options to achieve more sustainable consumption patterns, even if those alternatives are more expensive. Early pioneers such as Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods popularized plant-based meat substitutes. Companies like Seebo and Winnow have developed simple integration tools to help food manufacturers and restaurants control food waste along the manufacturing production line.\n\n\u2022**E-Commerce**: Tremendous energy and investment are devoted to how the intersection of retail, distribution and media might look in the future. Digital-first, direct-to-consumer platforms have flourished by focusing on a specific market segment, rethinking the consumer experience, and building community around their brand. Some examples include Warby Parker (eyewear), Harry\u2019s (personal care), Chewy (pets), Thrive Market (organic grocery), Wayfair (home decor), and Kaval and Rent The Runway (beauty/fashion/apparel) and Gucci (Luxury).\n\n\u2022**Crypto and Digital Assets**: The recent acceleration of crypto and digital assets as frictionless tools for the consumer continues to gain tremendous momentum with the rise of platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, Chainalysis, BlockChain.com and BlockFi or security solutions for crypto assets, such as hardware wallet technologies developed by Ledger. These technologies make the internet ownable, providing new ways to reward and compensate creators for their work allowing unbound creativity, and driving toward the emergence of potentially massive new platforms to harness this democratization of scarcity. We have witnessed heightened demand for the ability to \u2018purchase\u2019 or \u2018own\u2019 pieces of art (SuperRare), content collectibles (Dapper Labs), game collectibles (Axie Infinity), real estate (Decentraland) and much more \u2013 all of which is uniquely enabled by the blockchain. Consumers have been empowered to invest directly in athletes\u2019 performance (Sorare), artists (Beeple), and creators (Rally, Mirror), past or present. We believe these non-fungible tokens (NFTs) will enable greater liquidity for previously illiquid assets and reflect the nearly unimaginable scaling that the internet enables.",

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/smallstreetbets sub! Welcome to a new day, frrrrrrrresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, December 2nd, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Dow futures rise 100 points as travel stocks get boost following omicron sell-off](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/01/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n&gt; Dow futures rose in early trading Thursday despite the arrival of the latest Covid variant on U.S. shores and as the White House tightened travel restrictions.\n*****\n&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 120 points. S&amp;P 500 futures were flat and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.4%.\n*****\n&gt; The Biden administration reacted to the news that an omicron case had been reported in California by asking businesses to proceed with vaccination requirements, even though the administration\u2019s mandate was halted in courts pending review. The White House also tightened travel rules, requiring inbound passengers to be tested within 24 hours prior to departure.\n*****\n&gt; Airline, casino and energy stocks led the gainers in premarket trading.\n*****\n&gt; Dow component Boeing\u2019s shares jumped 3.6%, cruise line Royal Caribbean was up 3.6% while MGM Resorts International moved 2.7% higher, with Covid-sensitive companies benefitting amid early evidence showing the new strain may be less severe than earlier versions.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe remain cautious on S&amp;P 500 amid a hawkish Fed tightening into an overvalued market,\u201d said Savita Subramanian, Bank of America Securities head of U.S. equity &amp; quantitative strategy.\n*****\n&gt; Still, Bank of America noted that December has historically been the strongest month for the S&amp;P 500, with the average gaining 2.3% on average since 1936 and positive 79% of the time. However, December has not always been immune to sell-offs, Subramanian added.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAnother risk is an inflation-led consumption hit, especially as fiscal/monetary stimulus run out. Fed Chair Powell\u2019s comments on accelerated tapering and retiring the word \u2018transitory\u2019 indicate that the Fed\u2019s focus is now inflation rather than employment.\n*****\n&gt; During regular trading on Wednesday, stocks posted strong gains earlier in the session, but fell on news that the first omicron case had been reported in California. The Dow fell about 460 points, after the 30-stock benchmark had advanced 521 points. The S&amp;P dipped 1.18%, giving back an earlier gain of about 1.9%. The Nasdaq Composite slid 1.83%, after earlier trading 1.8% higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cInvestors are increasingly cautious about the Omicron variant as well as the likelihood of faster tapering,\u201d TD Securities said in a note to clients.\n*****\n&gt; Wednesday\u2019s whipsaw continues a highly volatile streak for stocks as the market digests what the new variant means.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this movie before and Wall Street will likely remain COVID-variant headline driven until a clear assessment over this wave can be made,\u201d said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. \u201cThe next couple of weeks will likely see risk appetite take a cue from incremental Omicron updates, supply chain issues, and every inflation reading,\u201d he added.\n*****\n&gt; On the data front, weekly initial jobless claims numbers will be released Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists are expecting a print of 240,000, according to estimates from Dow Jones. The prior reading showed 199,000 first-time filers, which was the lowest since November 1969. The November jobs report will be released on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Thursday\u2019s reading follows a better-than-expected ADP report on Wednesday. Private payrolls increased by 534,000 in November, ahead of the expected 506,000.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/lcmXJqv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/s3ioTNr.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/p6nFjhw.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Jml9Z5I.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/5KwRD2M.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($LI $CRM $CRWD $DOCU $SNOW $AI $DG $MRVL $ZS $ASAN $OKTA $ULTA $AMBA $NTAP $SIG $EXPR $HPE $BBW $BQ $BNS $JKS $FRO $MOMO $HIBB $SPLK $SWBI $QH $RY $CHS $BZUN $FIVE $BOX $VERU $YJ $KR $CTRN $TD $VEEV $BIG $GMS $DOOO $CM $EMKR $PVH)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/5ocvp67.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($DG $KR $EXPR $SIG $TD $VERU $GMS $DLTH $CM $LE $SCWX $EH $MEI)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/C4kn8oK.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XAPdoyp.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/P3xLOTx.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/G1tGjkp.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/8154yxP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/830rtCF.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5SsP6hb.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Vwv5b34.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/21JATCM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* AAPL\n* DWAC\n* BA\n* ABUS\n* AMC\n* ADA.X\n* CFVI\n* CMMB\n* AGC\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/02/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-snowflake-boeing-apple-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Snowflake** \u2014 The cloud data company\u2019s shares jumped more than 13% after the company reported quarterly results that beat revenue estimates.

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 6th, 2021.\n\n# **More turbulence could be ahead for stocks as investors weigh omicron and the Fed\u2019s next steps - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/03/stocks-could-face-more-turbulence-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Volatility could continue to plague markets after a week of violent swings that sent many stocks plummeting.\n*****\n&gt; In the week ahead, investors await more news on the omicron Covid variant and another inflation report Friday that is expected to show consumer prices remain the hottest in three decades.\n*****\n&gt; In the past week, stocks sold off on worries about the omicron variant and concerns the Federal Reserve will move away from its easy policies and raise interest rates sooner than anticipated. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told a Congressional panel Tuesday that the central bank will consider speeding up the taper of its $120 billion monthly bond-buying program when it meets Dec. 14 and 15. The Federal Reserve put its bond-purchasing program in place in early 2020 to prop up the economy during the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a somewhat turbulent December because we probably need to wait for earnings season to get regrounded, back to fundamentals,\u201d said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset. \u201cFor as high as a lot of the ratios would suggest, price-to-sales, price-to-earnings, when you throw it into the hopper with interest rates and everything else, things aren\u2019t that bad. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re teetering on the edge of a cliff.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But Ablin did say the comments from Powell were unnerving investors, who fear the Fed will also speed up interest rate hikes. Powell acknowledged he was wrong about inflation being \u201ctransitory,\u201d or temporary, spooking investors. The bond purchases are now scheduled to end in June.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI\u2019m not sure what investors\u2019 read on inflation is. Do they think the Fed is going to raise rates, get ahead of it too early and everything is going to roll over? Ever since Powell took \u2018transitory\u2019 out of his talk, investors have been somewhat off balance,\u201d said Ablin.\n*****\n&gt; The consumer price index or CPI for November is expected Friday morning. Economists polled by Dow Jones predict it rose 0.6% on a monthly basis, or 6.7% year over year. That compares to a 0.9% gain in October, and a 6.2% jump year over year, the biggest move in three decades.\n*****\n&gt; # Risky names slammed\nHigh fliers and growth were among the hardest hit Friday, as investors bailed out of some of the riskiest stocks. As stocks plunged Friday, Treasury yields fell. Yields move opposite price, and the move was seen as a flight to safety. The 10-year note yield fell to 1.35%.\n*****\n&gt; The ARK Innovation ETF was down nearly 12.7% for the week. Most of the growth names in the fund plunged into bear market territory. \u201cI think investors have to keep in mind that\u2019s not a 15-week strategy. It\u2019s a 15-year strategy, as far as we\u2019re concerned,\u201d Ablin said.\n*****\n&gt; For the week, the small cap Russell 2000 was down nearly 4%, while the S&amp;P 500 was off just 1.2%. The worst performing major sector for the week was communications services, which includes internet companies. It was down 2.8%, followed by consumer discretionary, off 2.4%. Financials lost nearly 2%, and the S&amp;P technology sector was down 0.4% for the week. But on Friday, tech lost 1.7%.\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve should be quiet in the week ahead. Fed officials traditionally do not make major speeches in the blackout period, which is the coming week, ahead of their Dec. 14 and 15 meeting. One exception is Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari who speaks Thursday at the Center for Indian Country Development Research Summit.\n*****\n&gt; Much of the focus will be on how the market itself is performing.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cEver since the Nov. 22 outside bearish day, all strength has been sold with lots of damage underneath the hood,\u201d said Scott Redler of T3Live.com. \u201cNow finally some of the leadership names are showing faulty action.\u201d He noted that both Microsoft and Apple were weaker.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMoney is not hiding in Amazon, Google, or Facebook. They haven\u2019t been special for weeks,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P closed below its 50-day moving average Friday, after closing below it Wednesday. The 50-day is at 4,544. That\u2019s a signal to some market technicians that the index is on the verge of breaking down. The 50-day moving average is the average closing price over the past 50 days, and is viewed as a momentum indicator.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBasically, it\u2019s effectively a retest of support because we had the relief rally [Thursday],\u201d said Katie Stockton, founder of Fairlead Strategies. She said the S&amp;P 500 needs to close below the 50-day for two consecutive days before the move is considered a breakdown.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe action in the high growth, high multiple names is not a good sign,\u201d said Stockton. \u201cWe do have some signs of downside exhaustion but not as widespread as I would hope. We\u2019re seeing some of the heavyweights, like Adobe for example, taking out levels like the 50-day moving averages.\u201d She said some of those big names have now joined the selling.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re just watching how bad it gets. Monday is going to be the tell,\u201d said Stockton. \u201cThat also gives it the weekend to settle... Extremes have gotten a little bit more extreme. Sentiment is the most oversold from a contrarian perspective since the October low.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/hk2QMMD.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/w6utI7X.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/N8u66xV.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/tagANgL.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/28oKFM3.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/t8zd2PY.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fEvF2Bm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ponrnUL.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SqxThz0.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ARPnz4g.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/3QmNJUa.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/sz567v5.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/s9GIfxy.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/zBWalJo.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/Cz7EeMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small-Cap Corrections\n\n&gt; At the close on Wednesday (12/1), the small-cap Russell 2,000 had fallen 12.1% from its recent high on November 8th, leaving the index in \"correction\" territory. A market \"correction\" is a drop of 10%+ that was preceded by a rally of at least 10% on a closing basis. This correction for the Russell 2,000 is its 58th since data for the index begins in 1978. Below is a table showing prior corrections for the Russell. The average correction sees the index fall 18.35%, which is just shy of the 20% threshold for a \"bear market.\" The median correction is a little smaller at -15.4%. In terms of length, the average Russell correction has lasted 73 days, while the median is 62 days. For the current Russell 2,000 correction to reach average levels, it would need to fall another 7% from here, and it would come to an end on January 20th, 2022.\n\n&gt; In terms of extremes, the biggest correction that the Russell 2,000 has ever experienced was the 41.9% decline seen during the initial COVID Crash from 1/16/20 to 3/18/20. The longest correction lasted 397 days from 6/24/83 to 7/25/84. In terms of the shortest correction, there were two that lasted 3 days. One of those came during the Financial Crisis while the other happened last June.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/raycorrec.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # December Typically Starts Out Weak\n\n&gt; December typically starts out weak as tax-loss selling ramps up and with the big gains this year we would expect that early December weakness to materialize. Then as you can see in the typical December chart here stocks begin to takeoff around mid-month led by small caps and the Russell 2000.\n\n&gt; This is what used to be known as the \u201cJanuary Effect:\u201d small caps outperforming large caps in the month of January. Nowadays most of the so-called January Effect takes place in the last half of December (2021 Almanac pages 110 &amp; 112, 2022 pages 112 &amp; 114). The January Effect is not to be confused with the January Barometer (2021 Almanac page 16, 2022 page 18), which states as the S&amp;P 500 goes in January, so goes the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/84caf5990b652671445781962a51ee2f/b2ebb400780bd4c8-af/s500x750/1795f2bbf763fb254a002bda32bd9b217881240b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # December Almanac: Small Cap Effect &amp; Santa Claus Rally\n\n&gt; Trading in December is holiday inspired and fueled by a buying bias throughout the month. However, the first part of the month tends to be weaker as tax-loss selling and yearend portfolio restructuring begins. Regardless, December is laden with market seasonality and important events.\n\n&gt; December is the number three S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials month since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% on each index. It\u2019s the second-best Russell 2000 (1979) month and third best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000 (1979). In 2018, DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of 2018 is not all that likely. When December is down it is usually a turning point in the market\u2014near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half of the month.\n\n&gt; In the last seventeen post-election years, December\u2019s ranking slip to #7 S&amp;P 500, #7 NASDAQ and DJIA #5. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, tend to have a field day in post-election-year Decembers. Since 1981, the Russell 2000 has lost ground three time in ten post-election years in December. The average small cap gain in all ten years is a solid 2.2%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/64044be6e473181304fe66b98074cbde/5618185eea1cfe29-fe/s400x600/931f46ef694541cebb05ea5f3193a5faa1f6bc60.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Small caps tend to start to outperform larger caps near the middle of the month (early January Effect) and The \u201cSanta Claus Rally\u201d begins on the open on December 27 and lasts until the second trading day of 2022. Average S&amp;P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%.\n\n&gt; Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down. The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch\u2019s now famous line states, \u201cIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 6 Things To Know About December And Omicron\n\n&gt; Here comes December, historically a pretty solid month for stocks, but now we have the Omicron variant wreaking havoc on markets. \u201cWhat a difference a week makes. A week ago stocks were at all-time highs and the economy was strong. Now all we have are uncertainties and questions,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAs of now we\u2019re optimistic that stocks will sidestep the new variant worries, but we recommend investors buckle up their seatbelts, as the end of 2021 could be a bumpy one.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here are six things to think about as we head into the jolliest month of them all.\n\n&gt; First, historically, the S&amp;P 500 Index has gained 1.5% on average in December, which is the third best month of the year with only April and November better. But as you can see here, over the past 10 years, December has been much weaker. Of course, much of this was due to a huge 9.2% drop in 2018 (which we\u2019ll get to soon enough).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-pic-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Second, some more good news is December has been up 74.3% of the time, more than any other month of the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-2-.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; drop in 2018. Only once in history was December the worst month of the year for the S&amp;P 500 and it was indeed in 2018. Three times it was the second worst month of the year, in 1968, 1980, and 1996. The worst monthly return so far this year was a 4.8% drop in September.\n\n&gt; Fourth, stocks usually don\u2019t get moving until the second half of the month, right as the holiday good feel vibes start to come out.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-pic-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Fifth, this year is in rare air, as all 11 months have made a new all-time high so far. Should the S&amp;P 500 make new highs in December that would be a perfect 12 for 12, matching 2014 as the only years to complete this incredible feat.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-post-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Sixth, as we show in the LPL Chart of the Day, it turns out that when stocks are up more than 20% for the year heading into December (like 2021), the final month actually does better, up 1.7% versus 1.5%. Also, it has been higher eight of the past nine times the year was up more than 20% heading into the final month.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-post-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Job Growth Came Up Short in November\n\n&gt; The domestic economy added just 210,000 jobs during November, well below Bloomberg-surveyed economists\u2019 consensus forecast for a gain of 550,000 and below October\u2019s revised tally of 546,000. The net revision to prior months was positive but only by 82,000.\n\n&gt; The modest 23,000 gain in leisure and hospitality jobs, which were up 170,000 in October, and a 20,000 drop in retail jobs don\u2019t make much sense given solid retail sales data of late. That could set up a positive reversal from revisions next month, though that potential bump will play some tug-of-war with the emergence of the Omicron COVID-19 variant, which came after the November survey period ended.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, for the past four months the pace of job gains has been well below the pre-Delta variant levels of near 1 million back in June and July. However, there are a number of reasons to be optimistic that job growth picks up in early 2022, assuming the Omicron variant doesn\u2019t get in the way.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe job growth number is disappointing, no doubt, especially considering the survey period fell before we even know the name of the newest Covid-19 variant,\u201d noted LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. \u201cWhile Omicron may curb hiring a bit over the next month or two, we remain confident in our expectation for strong job gains and above-average growth in the U.S. economy in 2022.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-pic-12.3.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The story was clearly better when looking at the unemployment rate, derived from the household survey rather than from employers. The unemployment rate unexpectedly fell from 4.6% to 4.2% in November as workers\u2014in an encouraging sign\u2014came off the sidelines (1.14 million of them), lifting the participation rate by 0.2% to 61.8%, a post-recession high but still well off pre-pandemic levels.\n\n&gt; Inflation data also painted a somewhat reassuring picture. The year-over-year increase in average hourly earnings rose less than expected at 4.8% (+0.3% month over month), below consensus expectations of 5.0% and 0.4%, and not enough to keep up with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) over the same period. It\u2019s reasonable to conclude that the increase in labor participation helped limit wage increases, but we have a long way to go there still. The labor market is still 3.9 million jobs below pre-pandemic levels and the labor market remains under-supplied, as noted above. In other words, further improvement in participation will still be needed to help contain inflation pressure.\n\n&gt; Some will argue that this report will make the Federal Reserve (Fed) think twice before accelerating tapering of its bond purchases, but we\u2019re not so sure.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere were a number of positives with this jobs report,\u201d explained LPL Financial Fixed Income Strategist Lawrence Gillum. \u201cLabor force participation increased and the unemployment rate fell\u2014both of which point to a continued strong jobs market. That may give the Fed reasons to speed up its tapering plans.\u201d\n\n&gt; Overall, this report is a disappointing reminder that we\u2019re going to have to wait longer for the booming jobs numbers that we still expect to see. We continue to expect more people to get back to work in the months ahead, in an environment of strong labor demand, which can help alleviate wage pressure and firm up the economic growth outlook. Omicron is a risk but based on the information we have today, we do not expect that variant, or any others, to meaningfully slow the job market recovery in 2022.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending December 3rd, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.5.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * (**$CHPT $GME $LULU $CHWY $COST $AZO $RH $SAIC $LOVE $AVGO $DLHC $PATH $COUP $MDB $ASO $DBI $THO $ORCL $PLAY $CBP $SFIX $HRL $S $CONN $SUMO $SOL $UNFI $KFY $GTLB $CIEN $ALCO $PD $TOL $HQY $CASY $CNM $VRA $GEF $JW.A $ALOT $PLAB $AOUT**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ARPnz4g.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/V8bYDe5.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.6.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/br3K0zL.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.6.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hbGoBFe.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  12.7.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tM8wghC.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 12.7.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hhcFlGr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.8.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/lPByiPr.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.8.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FNjpxcY.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.9.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2PUPQhA.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.9.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/6kqQxly.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.10.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/OcHR8nI.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.10.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ChargePoint Holdings, Inc. $21.57\n&gt; **ChargePoint Holdings, Inc.

Folks are loading up. especially during a bear market this is HUGEE.\n\nAnother catalyst i look for is jim cramer: jim says sell i say BUY!!!!\n\n\u201cNo. I looked at this. We were talking about it with the investment club people. We got together and said, OK, just one more, one more, one more. I\u2019m not there. I\u2019m not backing this group. Just can\u2019t.\u201d - Jim Cramer\n\nNow lets talk about the bearish thesis\n\n* china cracking down on Chinese stock in the us market as polestar has links to china\n* its a spac merger still hasn't gone through yet so your investing in hopes that the merger gets approved and goes through\n* SEC investigation\n\nmy thought on these 3 bearish thesis\n\n* polestar isn't a Chinese company its based in Switzerland but has financial ties to china\n* Gores Guggenheim has a stellar website and has done this before. When polestar CEO was interviewed Dec 2nd he sounded very confident in GG merger\n* SEC investigation happens to majority of spec word is it has something to do with the price being to low or the 6% stake gg will receive after merger\n\nDid I miss anything?\n\nWhat are your thoughts ?",

That\u2019s just my guess, and I\u2019m a long term investor so I don\u2019t care too much about what happens in the day to day or even month to month. \n\nWhat I do care about though is whether I should dump a ton of money into Microsoft now, or just a little bit anticipating a correction. Because it\u2019s parabolic, I don\u2019t feel confident it would continue, but who knows. \n\nWhat do you guys think? \n\nNote: I love Microsoft and it\u2019ll be worth a hell of a lot more in 10 years than it will be today, even if we are super inflated.",

        "selftext": "this is just a quick take note to clients &amp; readers on a position that I'm repositioning...\n\nCF Acquisition Corp will become Satellogic later this month. You have this week to redeem your units. I recommend you do so.\u00a0\n\nThe share price of CFV is a shade under $10. It has been remarkably stable. Many of the owners of CFFVU are institutional and accredited investors who invested to make a small return on their money and get the warrants for free. The units are barely above $10, which tells me there is a lot of risk of a dive upon redemption. I don't want to take that risk.\u00a0\n\nI believe since this stock has not run higher on the Satellogic deal, that if you have the units, then you should go to your brokerage and redeem them. You will receive about $10 per share, but also 1/3 of a warrant for every unit. Do this now, the deadline is coming!\u00a0\n\nIf you own CFV shares, you are about even, maybe a few cents up. Sell the shares. Do this now!\n\nWhen the redemptions occur, this is going to look a lot like Spire Global I think. Not for sure, but it is set up that way. Even if it doesn't dip to $8ish or lower, I think there will be enough volatility to buy the shares later as we see how things develop. I do like all of these satellite as a service companies long-term, but why take another bruising?\u00a0\n\n...just my opinion, do your own research and consider your own risk tolerance and goals",
