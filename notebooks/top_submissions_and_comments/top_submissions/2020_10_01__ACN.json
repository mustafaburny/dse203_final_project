TheStreet score\n\nThe first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I'm only keeping stocks with A+, A or A- rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.\n\nFrom thestreet.com:\n\n***A (Excellent)*** *- The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*\n\nAnd about the methodology (source: [https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html](http://Valuation of entry parameters:)):\n\n*TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*\n\n# 2. Zacks Rank\n\nIt is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we're avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company's shares. More from [https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6](http://(average, from experts)):\n\n*The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that uses trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises to classify stocks into five groups: Strong Sell, Sell, Hold, Buy, Strong Buy*\n\n*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&amp;P 500's +10.6% .*\n\n# 3. Weiss Ratings recommendation\n\nWe're only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.\n\nWjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):\n\n*\"A\" Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company\u2019s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company\u2019s earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our \u201cA\u201d rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a \"****Strong Buy****\".*\n\n*\"B\" rating:* ***Good.*** *The company\u2019s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our \u201cB\u201d rating is considered the equivalent of a \"****Buy****\".*\n\n# 4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price\n\nIt is required that the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.\n\n# 5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price\n\nSimilar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current valuation.\n\n# 6. Piotroski F-Score\n\nThe Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company's financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski\u2019s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:\n\n*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*\n\nIt is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from [https://www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/).\n\n# 7. Moody's Daily Credit Risk\n\nMoody\u2019s Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a company\u2019s liabilities.\n\nThe value is retrieved from[ https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/)\n\n# 8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score\n\nThe rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.\n\nMore detailed explanation from [https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean):\n\n*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*\n\n*A low score doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s much of a bullish case for it.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  [https://www.tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/) (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.\n\nI hope you enjoyed the reading.

        "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nI have been looking to diversify out of tech. ETFs make up 50% of my portfolio with SPY making up about 40% of it. I also have 10% in QQQ. Of my individual stocks, tech makes up about 60%. I currently have non-tech holdings in Disney, KO, ICLN, BABA, a small portion in NIO and SNE. I know SNE is tech but it does not move with the sector much and I really like this position. Any thoughts on good buys. I was really interested in BA but wanted to wait to see what happened after sept 15th and that wasn't great. Great buy but will take years so I am watching for now. Some others I have been following are V/MA, FDX (although getting pricey), J&amp;J and CVS. Another reasonable option I have been considering is putting more money into SPY and also ICLN to a lesser extent. Appreciate any input or other ideas. Thanks!",

        "selftext": "There's a huge amount of people in Crypto who think that Buy&amp;Hold is the best strategy. That might be true (especially when effort vs results are considered) for more mature markets, but I felt that in Crypto, simple Trend Following should be able to catch the bulk of the big moves and avoid most of the bear markets, so I ran some tests.\n\n# Strategies\n\nI picked some of the most basic Trend Following strategies with reasonable/round parameters:\n\n* **MA Crossover** (*rx\\_xma*)\u2014 when fast MA crosses over slow MA, go long. I will also use several different MAs for this \u2014 EMA, LRC (LinReg), HMA, WMA, KAMA, SuperSmoother, WVMA, TEMA, ZLEMA. `Parameters used: fast MA = 5d, slow MA = 40d`\n* **Supertrend** (*SupertrendXm*) \u2014 uses ATR to get band width, goes long if price over the band. `Parameters used: ATR period = 5d, band multiplier = 1.5/2/2.5`\n* **Bollinger Bands Breakout** (*rx\\_bb\\_bout*) \u2014 goes long when price over upper band. `Parameters used: BB period = 3d/5d, BB stddev = 2, MA = EMA/LRC/SuperSmoother`\n* **High/Low Breakout** (*hilo*) \u2014 goes long when price over previous X days high. Close position when under X days low. `Parameters used: period = 5d/10d`\n* **Linear Regression Slope** (*expreg\\_slope*) \u2014 goes long when slope of regression &gt; 0. `Parameters used: reg period = 5d/10d/15d`\n* **Single MA/Price Crossover** (*rx\\_xma\\_single*) \u2014 goes long when price crosses over MA. Same MAs as *rx\\_xma* will be used (EMA, LRC, etc). `Parameters used: reg period = 30d`\n* **Single MA Slope** (*rx\\_xma\\_slope*) \u2014 goes long when slope of MA &gt; 0. Same MAs as *rx\\_xma* will be used. `Parameters used: MA period = 20d, slope period = 1d`\n\n# Testing setup\n\n* Long only.\n* 0.10% commission.\n* Simple condition for entry (long), reverse for exit (close).\n* No stoplosses or take profits.\n* Use 100% of balance on each trade (will add position sizing in next post).\n* 60m candle size, except for *Supertrend* (1d to get daily ATR).\n\n# Coins and date ranges used\n\nI will use 25 of the \\~TOP50 coins and 3 different date ranges. Specific coins for each date range depend on data availability. Some will use partial range data (starting later), specified in parentheses.\n\n**Jan 2017 \u2014 July 2020**  \nCoins used: XBT, ETH, XRP (since May 18, 2017), LTC, BCH (since Aug 1, 2017), XMR, DASH (Apr 12, 2017), ETC, ZEC, GNO (since May 1, 2017), IOT (since Jun 12, 2017), REP\n\n**Jan 2018 \u2014 July 2020**  \nCoins used: all of the above + BNB, EOS, XLM, ADA, TRX, NEO, OMG\n\n**Jan 2019 \u2014 July 2020**  \nCoins used: all of the above + BSV, XTZ, LINK, ONT, QTUM, QSH\n\n# Results\n\nHere are the results, AVG profits over all tested assets.\n\n* [Jan2019 - Jul2020](https://i.postimg.cc/QCkJBGSK/1-med10-profit-Jan2019-Jul2020-2020-08-24-13-24.png)\n* [Jan2018 - Jul2020](https://i.postimg.cc/xT6LBPZQ/4-med10-profit-Jan2018-Jul2020-2020-08-24-13-31.png)\n* [Jan2017 - Jul2020](https://i.postimg.cc/3x6mxx7b/6-med10-profit-Jan2017-Jul2020-2020-08-24-13-36.png)\n\n# Conclusion\n\n* Charts seem pretty conclusive to me: Trend Following &gt; Buy&amp;Hold.\n* **You won't beat Buy&amp;Hold like this on each and every asset that you test or trade live. But, over multiple assets, chances are you will on average.**\n* Trade frequency is a bit low (0.5 - 2 per week).\n* Max drawdowns are still pretty big (60 - 80%). Need some filters, stoplosses and position/risk management.\n* **While it's highly unlikely to beat pure isolated BULL market (like 2017) with basic Trend Following, over longer periods with multiple big swings, strategies catch bulk of the moves and come out ahead.**",

PayPal is currently sitting around $15 below its ATH. There is probably no need to explain what PayPal is or what it does.\n\nTotal Payment Volume (TPV)\n\n\"Total  Payment Volume or \"TPV\" is the value of payments, net of payment  reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform,  excluding transactions processed through our gateway products.\"\n\n\\--&gt; *Fees on money transactions*\n\nThat means that PayPal makes more money when more transactions are being made.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n1iw3tt13dr51.png?width=554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c5711eda5ad1f0422692e74985c16820a43f0fe\n\n**Free Cashflow (FCF)**\n\n$2.19B in Q2 with an increase 112% y/y\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2tr61wt23dr51.png?width=550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f3f312a637670c54ebbd70fb223f49b60e5d4fc\n\n\\--&gt;  Now you are probably asking yourself what all those fucking images and  words mean. It\u00b4s simple. PayPal has seen a lot of new users due to the  pandemic and everyone ordering their shit from Jeff Bezos. We are still  in a pandemic and the second wave is about to come. This means that more  and more people are going to use services like PayPal and as I stated  above; more users means more transactions which means more money for PayPal. So more tendies for us.

TPV will rise due to more and more people using PayPal due to the Pandemic. This will lead the FCF to rise as well and this makes stonks go up for us to make some tendies.\n\n**New Customers**\n\nPayPal has seen a rise in new accounts of 21.3 million in Q2.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6xkjfind3dr51.png?width=414&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1c34c732b58eb2c3daa5581dffaa5d0a5ba565b\n\n**So how are we making tendies on the upcoming earnings?**\n\nPayPal is expecting \"strong momentum from Q2 to continue into Q3\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1slqhmre3dr51.png?width=478&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9fa90bc61c64cebfb38f1b4d565bd4ab7172632\n\n*They will be crushing earnings* [*again*](https://i.imgur.com/iBhZqrE.png) *like they did in Q2 (actual Growth: 22% and 25%)*\n\nAnalysts have set a *price target around $220.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img n0vw56pf3dr51...*\n\n**Recent News**\n\n\"PayPal and Mastercard will continue the global expansion of its PayPal Business Debit Mastercard.\" [Source](https://www.mobilepaymentstoday.com/news/paypal-business-debit-mastercard-expands-european-market-reach/)\n\nThey also announced to support black communities and businesses. [Source](https://investor.paypal-corp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/paypal-announces-recipients-5-million-community-partner-grants)\n\nConclusion\n\nIt may not be the most exciting stock to play this month but it is a relatively safe play.\n\nPositions: 220c somewhere in November\n\nGood luck everyone",

        "selftext": " ***$CHFS:***\n\n(NASDAQ:CHFS) rose 30.3% to $0.47 in pre-market trading, before tumbling back down to the current price of .37c. CHF Solutions recently received 180-day extension to meet Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement.\n\nOther than this, we have received little to no news from this company. Definitely a chart play. On the 180d chart, you can see a clear reversal happened last week, the question is how far can this push? Next line of resistance in the high 40\u2019s low 50\u2019s, with enough volume we could see this one have run similar to the one in pre-market.\n\n50 day moving average is approaching the 200 day moving average at a consistent rate. Has the possibility of crossing in the next few days. Going to check the overall direction at market open and decide whether or not it\u2019s good to get in this one a few days late.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Trend reversal](https://preview.redd.it/h5klrqqwq9r51.png?width=1604&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4556b678b9d692cc89d9acd788ee83d7003ce395)\n\n ***$TBLT:***\n\nAug. 25, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  ToughBuilt Industries, Inc.  (\u201cToughBuilt\u201d) (NASDAQ: TBLT; TBLTW), an advanced product design, manufacture and international distributor with emphasis on innovative products currently focused on tools and other accessories for the professional and do-it-yourself construction industries, today announced their products have been accepted for immediate placement on www.rona.ca. \n\nRona.ca will carry 64 SKU\u2019s of ToughBuilt products, including but not limited to Cliptech tool belts, bags and totes, knee pads, sawhorses, and Miter Saw Stands. Rona Canadian customers will now have the option to purchase ToughBuilt products while they shop online at [www.rona.ca](http://www.rona.ca/).\n\nMichael Panosian , Chief Executive Officer of ToughBuilt, commented, \u201cWe are pleased to announce this new cooperation with Rona and look forward to adding more new items in fourth quarter. Rona\u2019s great distribution throughout  Canada  allows us to expand our brand awareness and increase our market share in this growing market. We also believe and look forward to a significant growth in both professional and DIY business in  Canada  within the second quarter and beyond.\u201d www.rona.ca is the online arm of  Rona, Inc. \n\nCreated in 1939, RONA is a banner of Lowe\u2019s  Canada , one of Canada\u2019s leading home improvement companies with head office located in  Boucherville, Quebec . Spanning the entire country, RONA\u2019s vast network of more than 375 stores includes both corporate stores and independent affiliated dealers. Known for its large in-store and online product selection as well as for its installation services, RONA also provides expert support and advice to its retail and pro customers for their building and renovation projects.\n\nQuarantine + home improvement go hand in hand, this much is obvious. On the 180d chart, the 50 day moving average just crossed the 200 day ma, and the last two trading days brought higher lows and higher highs. PR expected beginning of October. Be cautious with this one, as i am seeing this ticker blasted all over social media and reddit.

The deal closed this week. Shares plummeted 24.5% to close at  $18.69  on Wednesday, the stock's first day of trading under its new symbol, VLDR. Investors might have overreacted. Baird analyst Tristan Gerra launched coverage of the company Thursday, rating shares the equivalent of Buy. His target for the stock price is $28, about 50% higher than recent trading levels.\n\nLidar is, essentially, laser-based radar and part of the suite of sensors auto makers use to achieve advanced safety features, as well as create self- driving cars. Gerra expects sales to grow 55% a year on average for the next four years, hitting  $684 million  by 2024. Velodyne Lidar is well positioned to maintain its position as the volume and cost leader --  $100  announced \\[selling prices\\] -- as the company continues to optimize performance and costs along with its proprietary manufacturing,\" wrote Gerra in a Wednesday evening report beginning coverage of the stock. Lidar is expensive. And driving down sensor costs is key to adoption. \" Lidars will become an integral part of autonomous vehicles' sensor systems, owing to camera limitations,\" he said. Cameras can't function in all conditions.\n\nVelodyne says it has more than 300 customers, including auto makers. Gerra writes the company has engaged with Tesla (TSLA). Gerra is the only analyst covering Velodyne at the moment. The average stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average has about 30 analysts.\n\nDespite the relative lack of coverage, Velodyne isn't small. Its market capitalization, based on the pro-forma total of shares outstanding post merger, is about  $3.3 billion . At the stock's recent high, the market value was more than $5.5 billion.\n\nHidden opportunity here. This stock took one hell of a slide downward during the month of September after the deal with GRAF closed, with a high of $32.75/share and now just trading at $17. Things I like about this company:\n\n* Product that solves an issue and is necessary (autonomous safety)\n* Engaged with big name customers (including Tesla)\n* Under most people\u2019s radar\n* 50% fall in one month is a clear overreaction \n* Merger implies later catalysts\n\nLong $VLDR\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Rough September](https://preview.redd.it/t75p7rh4r9r51.png?width=1608&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b79facf1a9249fe39d834ae22e5b8f91744888e)\n\n**Never forget to do your own DD; remember: For all you know, all the stocks that I mention here will dip 90% tomorrow; Do your own DD, I'm not some magic fairy. Trading will never come this easy to you. If all the stocks on here went up, I'd be chilling on my own Island.**",

It started to curl up and broke above the neckline(resistance of a specified trend pattern) and came back to it to test as support at 1.20. second point of confluence.

        "selftext": " **FAANGs, retail led market gainers while energy continued recent declines:**\n\n* **Consumer discretionary** was the best sector with department stores, apparel and AMZN-US among gainers. BBB-US rose sharply following earnings beat. **Communication services** were supported by FAANGS strength. **Tech** finished ahead with semis and software among the best segments. **Consumer staples** were in line as big box, grocers and cosmetics gained though drug stores were lower and foods mixed. **Financials** lagged with custody banks and P/C insurers lower. **Industrials** were behind with machinery and multis lower though airlines stronger. **Healthcare** was lower on hospital and large cap pharma declines and mixed performance in med tech. **Materials** were off with non-ferrous metals (copper prices down sharply), global miners and chemicals showing some weakness. **Energy** was broadly lower with all sectors down sharply.\n\n**White House boosts fiscal stimulus offer to $1.6T:**\n\n* [Roll Call](https://www.rollcall.com/2020/09/30/exclusive-mnuchin-coronavirus-relief-plan-includes-more-state-local-funds/) reported that in recent negotiations with House Speaker Pelosi about a fifth coronavirus relief bill, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin raised the White House's offer to just over $1.6T. This is up from an original proposal of $1T though Mnuchin has previously expressed a willingness to go up to $1.5T. The new offer includes $250B in funding for state and local governments, up from $100B, but below the nearly $400B+ sought by Democrats in their latest proposal. It also features $400 a week of additional unemployment benefits, up from their prior $300 a week offer but still below the $600 sought by Democrats. Talks expected to continue today and despite the favorable market reaction, still skepticism there will be enough additional movement to get something done. [Politico](https://www.politico.com/playbook) discussed how Senate Republicans present another big obstacle, even if Trump prods them to do a deal.\n\n**ISM manufacturing index lost a little strength in September:**\n\n* **ISM Manufacturing Index** for September of 55.4 missed 56.3 estimate, down from prior month 56. New orders index down 7.4 at 60.2, production index down 2.3 at 61, employment index up 3.2 at 49.6, new export orders index up 1 at 54.3. The report indicated expansion in the economy for the fifth month since contraction in April with manufacturers becoming better at maintaining output in reconfigured factories. Elsewhere, September **IHS Markit final manufacturing PMI** of 53.2 slightly lower than flash 53.5 and above 53.1 in August. New orders upticked while output (fastest in ten months) and employment (second fastest since Nov-19) growth increased sharply. August **construction spending** of 1.4% m/m beat consensus and prior reading of 0.7%.\n\n**Initial jobless claims and August personal consumption better:**\n\n* Weekly **initial jobless claims** at 837K in the week ending 26-Sep, versus consensus of 850K and below prior week reading of 873K (revised up 3k). Largest increases in NY, GA, MA, NJ; largest decreases in MA, MI. Four-week average was 867K, down 12K from last week. **Continuing claims** for the week ending 19-Sep were lower at 11.767M vs consensus 12.275M and prior week's 12.747M (revised up by 167K). Elsewhere, August monthly **personal consumption expenditures** of +1.0% m/m, above consensus 0.7% following July's 1.5% gain (revised down 0.4%); **personal income** fell 2.7% m/m versus expected -2.5% and July's +0.5% (revised up 0.1%) as federal unemployment benefits rolled off. **Core** **pce deflator** of 0.3% m/m (0.33% unrounded) met consensus though July revised up a tick to 0.4%. On a y/y basis, the inflation measure was 1.6%, two tenths above expected and prior reading.\n\n**Corporate layoffs raise more concerns about protracted crisis:**\n\n* [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-30/disney-shell-cuts-mark-warning-sign-for-global-economic-rebound?sref=L75TRUmI) discussed how the tens of thousands of job cuts announced by blue-chip companies in a 24-hour span is a warning sign for the global economic recovery. Recent layoff announcements have come from Disney (DIS-US ), Goldman Sachs (GS-US ), Allstate (ALL-US ), Marathon Petroleum (MPC-US ), Royal Dutch Shell (RDS-GB ), Elanco (ELAN-US ), and the airlines. The article highlighted concerns that job losses have begun to spill over the from the service sector that initially suffered the brunt of the layoffs from the coronavirus pandemic with more companies now looking to protect margins. Cost-cutting has been a key component of the earnings resilience theme. Back in late August, a [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-covid-19-layoffs-make-job-reductions-permanent-11598654257) article flagged concerns that a wave of corporate layoffs could be permanent as companies increasingly see the coronavirus pandemic as the driver of a more protracted economic downturn\n\n**Auto sector remains a recovery bright spot:**\n\n* [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-autos-sales/u-s-auto-sales-stay-on-recovery-path-despite-tight-inventory-idUSKBN26M4XB) and [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-01/fiat-chrysler-toyota-beat-3q-forecasts-auto-sales-update?sref=L75TRUmI) both discussed the recovery in the auto market over the course of Q3. General Motors (GM-US ), Fiat Chrysler (FCAU-US ) and Toyota (TM-US ) all reported better than expected results. GM also mentioned that sales improved sequentially each month within Q3 and that both industry and GM sales rebounded significantly in October, finishing the month with y/y sales increases. The articles highlighted strong consumer demand for SUVs, trucks and hybrids. These groups were longstanding outperformers before the coronavirus pandemic as well. Demand underpinned by a combination of broader economic recovery and low rates. A number of other companies with leverage to autos have also highlighted the sector recovery in their recent updates. These include dealers, semis and electronics.\n\n**Fed extends dividend and buyback restrictions on banks:**\n\n* Fed [announced ](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20200930b.htm)Wednesday after the close that none of the 33 banks with more than $100B of assets would be allowed to resume share repurchases in Q4 and that it would also maintain a cap on dividend payments. Fed said move intended to ensure the banks maintain a high level of capital resilience. Added that the capital positions of the big banks have remained strong during Q3 while such restrictions were in place. Move was widely expected by the Street. A number of banks that presented at the Barclays Global Financial Services Conference last month expressed an interest in resuming buyback activity as soon as possible. Capital return uncertainty has been an overhang on the group. The other big headwind has been lower NII guidance from softer loan demand and an uptick in repayments. However, banks have been more upbeat on asset quality.\n\n**Senate panel votes to subpoena tech executives:**\n\n* [The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/519101-senate-panel-votes-to-subpoena-big-tech-executives) noted that the Senate Commerce Committee voted Thursday to subpoena the CEOs of Twitter (TWTR-US ), Google (GOOGL-US ) and Facebook (FB-US ). The vote compels the CEOs to testify at a hearing on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act that will discuss social media's alleged conservative bias. The move was previewed last week. DOJ has already recommended that Congress pare back Section 230 laws, which give sites broad immunity from lawsuits for words, images, and videos. Back in May, President Trump signed an executive order to limit protections for online platforms. [Axios](https://www.axios.com/congress-looks-to-squeeze-big-tech-ahead-of-election-8deb407a-8e2a-4989-9682-dade915583a8.html) recently discussed how it's nearly certain that neither a Section 230 reform bill from the Senate nor the antitrust legislation that could come out of the House will pass anytime soon. Market has also tended to ignore the continued pickup in regulatory scrutiny in favor of secular growth and disruption themes.\n\n**Mixed vaccine headlines:**\n\n* [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-30/oxford-astra-covid-vaccine-review-said-to-start-in-europe?srnd=premium-asia&amp;sref=L75TRUmI) reported European regulators set to announce an accelerated review of the coronavirus candidate from AstraZeneca (AZN-US ) and the University of Oxford. This will allow them to see trial data while the study is ongoing and potentially speed up the approval process. However, [Reuters](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-vaccine-astrazenec/exclusive-fda-widens-u-s-safety-inquiry-into-astrazeneca-coronavirus-vaccine-sources-idUKKBN26L3T8) reported the FDA has broadened its investigation of a serious illness in the AstraZeneca trial and will look at data from earlier trials developed by the same scientists. Noted this raises likelihood of further delays for what has been one of the most advanced vaccine candidates. CEO of Moderna (MRNA-US ) told the [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/9b242ecc-3dce-4534-9171-cdf624468a2a) that his company would not be able to apply to the FDA for emergency use authorization of its coronavirus vaccine until at least late November. Added that he did not expect to have full approval for broad distribution until next spring. Timelines more in line with those of public health officials than Trump.",

        "selftext": "Summarized to save you time.\n\n**Still chatter about a broader stimulus bill, but even airline-only deal could be tough:**\n\n* [Politico](https://twitter.com/JakeSherman/status/1314208911654678530) said Treasury Secretary Mnuchin floated possibility of restarting broader stimulus talks in call with Speaker Pelosi last night. Then Trump told [Fox Business](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/pelosi-stimulus-checks-donald-trump-1200) this morning \"a bigger deal\" involving $1,200 stimulus checks was possible. Comments come after Trump talked about halting negotiations only to suggest yesterday he wanted Congress to pass funding for airlines, PPP and another round of stimulus checks. However, prospects for any deal remain dim, especially as Pelosi castigated Trump today for walking away from necessary relief. Some resistance within the GOP for more spending on stimulus, and Senate Majority Leader McConnell likely reluctant to bring up any measure his caucus is uncertain to back. Note GOP Sens. Toomey and Lee released a [statement](https://www.toomey.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/toomey-and-lee-issue-statement-regarding-an-additional-round-of-taxpayer-funded-grants-for-airlines) saying Congress should not make targeted grants to airlines. Other hurdles include Congress being out of session, focus on upcoming SCOTUS hearings, and short calendar before Election Day.\n\n**Pence and Harris square off in vice presidential debate:**\n\n* VP Pence and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris debated in Salt Lake City on Wednesday ([WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-covid-19-diagnosis-amps-up-spotlight-on-vice-presidential-debate-11602084013)). Pence defended administration's pandemic handling while touting strong economic stewardship and renegotiated trade deals. Harris zeroed in on Trump's poor management of the coronavirus. Harris demurred when asked whether Biden would push to add more justices to the Supreme Court. Also skirted question on presidential succession if her running mate becomes incapacitated. When pressed Harris said Biden would not ban fracking (though Harris said in 2019 said she would ban the practice). Meanwhile, Pence dodged a question about how Trump would protect pre-existing conditions if Affordable Care Act is struck down by Supreme Court. Debate was more civil than the Trump-Biden confrontation last week. Trump and Biden to debate again on 15-Oct. Organizers said debate now scheduled to be virtual, though Trump said that is not acceptable.\n\n**Continuing jobless claims fell significantly while initial claims in line:**\n\n* Weekly **initial jobless claims** at 840K in the week ending 3-Oct, versus consensus of 837K and prior week's reading 849k (revised up 12k). Largest increases in MA, IL, NJ; largest decreases in TX, FL, GA. Four-week average was 857K, down 13K from last week. **Continuing claims** for the week ending 26-Sep were well lower at 10.976M vs consensus 11.500M and prior week's 11.979M (revised up by 212K). Individuals filing initial claims in the federal **Pandemic Unemployment Assistance** program for week ending 3-Oct fell to 464K from 509K in prior week. Persons claiming benefits in **all programs** for week ending 19-Sep declined to 25.505M from 26.509M in the prior week.\n\n**Trump credits Regeneron's antibody cocktail for his recovery from coronavirus:**\n\n* In a [video](https://www.twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1313959702104023047), President Trump talked up Regeneron's (REGN-US ) experimental monoclonal antibody cocktail, saying it was \"key\" to his recovery from coronavirus ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-07/trump-hails-antibody-treatment-wants-all-patients-to-have-it?srnd=politics-vp&amp;sref=J9GPLx1B)). Added that he is working on getting the treatment authorized and that it should be made free to Americans. REGN said presence of antibodies in Trump's blood could be result of its treatment, and it will seek EUA ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-08/regeneron-seeks-fda-emergency-clearance-for-covid-19-treatment?srnd=premium-asia&amp;sref=J9GPLx1B)). Trump mentioned Eli Lilly (LLY-US ), which has also requested EUA of its experimental antibody-based treatment ([WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/eli-lilly-asks-fda-to-authorize-covid-19-antibody-drug-11602074998?mod=hp_lead_pos4)). Trump's physician, Sean Conley, noted detectable levels of coronavirus antibodies were found in Monday's blood sample that weren't detected on Thursday. In his video, Trump also said vaccines should be approved before election. He again faulted for China for the virus and said Beijing would pay a big price.\n\n**Bond market impact of a Blue Wave scenario under increasing scrutiny:**\n\n* [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/6369516f-d4d1-4a31-817c-417585b0c24a) said that investors are increasingly focusing on the risk of a decline in long-term US government bond prices in anticipation of a more robust economic recovery and hefty additional government spending after November's presidential election. Noted long-dated Treasury yields have risen sharply since the start of the month to highest levels since June, while some fund managers warn this may be the start of a sharper selloff in US debt, though magnitude of a move depends on results of elections. Article cited Goldman Sachs strategists said investors could pull forward expectations for US rate rises on stimulus and vaccine developments, while Morgan Stanley strategists described a \"rates scare\" of a sudden move higher in yields that could take market by surprise. However, some strategists said the Fed would show little tolerance for destabilizing increase in rates that upends efforts to support the economy.\n\n**Fed unlikely to change QE strategy, at least for now:**\n\n* [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-evans/fed-has-capacity-to-amp-up-bond-buying-but-no-need-now-evans-says-idUSKBN26S3K4?il=0) reported that Fed officials said the bank could ramp up its bond purchasing program or weight its purchases at the long end of the curve to push down further on borrowing costs. However, officials including Chicago's Evans (voter) said any changes are unlikely to happen in the short-term, with Evans saying it would be the Spring until he has a better sense of whether the Fed will need to give explicit guidance on the future pace or type of asset purchases. Also comes after yesterday's [September FOMC minutes](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20200916.htm) showed little discussion over whether to adjust the Fed's current $120B per month pace of bond purchases. Despite cautious approach to QE, a Fed paper this week said that bond purchases equal to 30% of US economic output, or \\~$6.5T, are required to offset the impact of the Fed's benchmark rate already being near zero ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-07/top-fed-economist-says-much-more-qe-needed-to-offset-zero-bound?sref=J9GPLx1B)).\n\n**Economists warn of impact on economic growth if stimulus negotiations fail:**\n\n* [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/07/business/second-stimulus-bill-fails-impact.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage) the latest to note the economic impact of the the end of stimulus, with loss of momentum likely to grow unless more aid doesn't arrive soon. Noted near universal agreement from economists who say more aid is needed for individuals, businesses, and local governments, and that the amount is less important than how fast and where the money is deployed. Also discussed aid to state and local governments, which economists say could drive sizable reduction in economic activity if left without additional support, though was a key area of disagreement in latest round of stimulus negotiations. Moody's last month said state and local governments will have budget shortfalls of $500B through summer 2022, assuming pandemic does not get worse. Biggest cuts expected to be in education and healthcare. Also highlighted worries further state spending reductions could prolong the economic downturn ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/07/business/state-budgets-coronavirus-aid.html)).\n\n**WSJ survey shows 43% of economists not expecting full labor market recovery until 2023:**\n\n* A [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/wsj-survey-43-of-economists-dont-see-u-s-gaining-back-lost-jobs-until-2023-11602165600) survey showed a slower timeline for a labor market recovery than predicted six months ago, particularly in travel and leisure because of continued high coronavirus infection rates. Cited a potential worsening of the COVID-19 crisis as the flu season approaches with no coronavirus vaccine, a lack of fresh fiscal stimulus, and uncertainty around the election as factors weighing on the labor market recovery. Around 80% of economists said the current election process is introducing more uncertainty into financial markets compared with elections of recent decades, and 73% saying it was creating more uncertainty than usual for the economy. However, the survey showed more optimism around a GDP rebound, with \\~58% of those surveyed expecting economic output to return to its prior peak in Q1-19 by 2021, while \\~19% expect it to recover by Q1-22. On average, the economists expect GDP to contract 3.6% this year, followed by growth of 3.7% in 2021 and 3% in 2022.\n\n**US explores restricting Ant Group and Tencent payment systems:**\n\n* People familiar with the matter told [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-07/u-s-explores-restrictions-on-ant-group-tencent-payment-systems?sref=J9GPLx1B) Trump administration is exploring restrictions on Ant Group and Tencent Holdings (700-HK ) over concerns their digital payment platforms threaten US national security and give Beijing access to banking and personal data of hundreds of millions of people. Restrictions could involve putting both companies on Treasury Department's national list, which effectively bars firms from doing business with them. Such a move would risk angering China beyond its unhappiness over TikTok. Administration officials discussed idea of restrictions in a 30-Sep meeting, though a final decision isn't imminent with officials acknowledging difficulty in moving forward until a mechanism is established. Also, no indication idea has been presented to Trump.\n\n**BoE Governor Bailey expects a Brexit deal, willing to take more action:**\n\n* [Reuters](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-boe-bailey/bank-of-englands-bailey-says-risks-are-very-much-to-the-downside-idUKKBN26T16D) cited comments by BoE Governor Bailey in the Yorkshire Post, who said he believed the UK and the EU can reach a deal, and in the best interests of both sides. He reiterated that while he would like to see Britain and the EU retain equivalent standards on financial services, it would be wrong to follow EU rules if it had no control over. Meanwhile, on the economic impact from the rising number of coronavirus cases, said it was likely to hurt economy, but less than initial surge earlier this year. In separate comments from SRB panel discussion, highlighted BoE was not out of firepower and would use if it needs in second and third wave of virus. Emphasized it must use policy actively and aggressively. Would use policy tools to the fullest extent possible to support economy ([Reuters](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-boe-bailey-firepower/bank-of-england-not-out-of-firepower-bailey-says-idUKKBN26T1D1?il=0))\n\n**ECB minutes emphasize FX impact, warns on complacency:**\n\n* The [ECB](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/accounts/2020/html/ecb.mg201008~49aeff32e1.en.html) September minutes discussively extensively the impact of a strong euro on the inflation outlook. It highlighted that appreciation of the euro had a material impact on inflation and market positioning was tilted to further gains. It noted that inflation expectations remained close to historic lows, amplifying risks to anchoring and there was broad agreement that there was no room for complacency. Two main FX drivers were identified: a reversal of dollar safe haven flows and the decisive action taken by EU governments on fiscal policy. It was thought that in the prevailing environment of uncertainty, the best course of action was to keep a steady hand on policy. Some made the point that with tensions in the market subsiding the pace of monthly asset purchases could be reduced. On the policy options available, it pointed to a further cut in the policy rate and changes to the TLTROs.",

        "selftext": "Hello /r/investing enthusiasts, \n\nI am really frustrated that our (US) legal system has limited access to pre-IPO market to those qualifying as 'accredited investors' (individuals with $1M+ in liquid assets or making &gt;$200k/year). I believe this law harms not just myself but society at large as the law fundamentally limits access to lucrative investment opportunities to the wealthy and upper-middle class.\n\nThe rhetoric behind the law states that those without that type of cash will not be able to successfully use these investment vehicles and need to be protected. I think that rhetoric is not just outdated, but fundamentally wrong. I have created a movement to give the opportunity to investors of lesser means (for now) to gain access to the 'accredited' designation. If you would like to receive updates on the project or just show interest in the movement's developments, please visit [https://www.getaccredited.us/landing](https://www.getaccredited.us/landing) and join the mailing list. \n\nJoining the mailing list will help us show lawmakers that we want to change this ruling and give us the power of knowing the investing community supports our efforts.
