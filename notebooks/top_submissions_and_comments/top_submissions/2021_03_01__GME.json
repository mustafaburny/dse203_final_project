With that being said, NOT FUCKING EVERYTHING IS A PLOY BY HEDGE FUNDS TO GET YOU OUT OF GME. This rocket squeeze was created by CEO, the CEO of rocket has done amazing things with the company, and their balance sheet is impressive. He hates shorts as much as we do, so he decided to do something about it by essentially creating a gamma squeeze. Rocket was a really good play, especially with options.

        "selftext": "I see a lot of people asking basic questions about calls on just about every thread that mentions them. So here you go.\n\nNote: before the finance majors come out and nitpick small things, remember that this is a basic primer for idiots; some of it has been simplified.\n\nWHAT IS A CALL OPTION: BASICS\n\nA call option (hereafter referred to simply as a \"call\") is a contract that gives you the ability, though not the obligation, to buy 100 shares of a stock for a specific price by a specific date, called the expiration date. Example: You buy a $400 call for GME that expires on March 19th. What that means is that at any time between now and end-of-day on 3/19, you can buy 100 shares of GME for $400. If the price spikes to $700 dollars, you can still buy them for $400. That's a pretty good deal.\n\nSo I need the price of GME to get to $400 to break even, and anything above that is profit, right? Not quite. You have to pay a premium for the option, which is the amount of money you're giving to the option seller in exchange for the contract. The premium is listed as the price per share, so if the option has a $2 premium, that means that you have to pay $2 per share of GME in the contract, which means that you pay $200 the buy the call ($2/share x 100 shares). You give the seller $200, and they give you the call option. Since you paid $200 for the option, this means that your break even price is $402 dollars per share. Why? Because if the price only got to $400, you could have bought it for $400/share without buying the contract, which means the money you spend on the contract was a waste. However, if the price goes to $403/share, then you make a profit, because you effectively paid $402/share for a stock worth $403/share.\n\nBut what if the price doesn't go up, or even goes down? Do I have to still buy those shares for $400? No. You never have to buy the shares if you don't want to. Remember, a call gives you the ability to buy shares for $400, but not the obligation.\n\nBut what if the price of GME goes way up but I don't have $40,000 around to buy 100 shares at $400/share? Then you sell the contract to someone who either does have $40,000 sitting around, or (slightly advanced info here that you don't need to know) to someone who is trying to offset a position. Regardless of who buys it, they will pay you a lot of money for your option because it is ITM, or in the money. What does that mean? Let's look at some option vocabulary.\n\nCALL OPTION VOCABULARY\n\nStrike Price: This is the price that you are allowed to pay for the stock per the contract. In our $400 call option above, the strike price is $400. At any time before the expiration date, you are allowed to exercise the contract the contract and pay $400/share for the stock.\n\nExercise: Exercising an option means you are exercising your ability to buy the 100 shares of stock. In the example above, you would spend $40,000 for 100 shares of stock regardless of the stock's price at the time. Can I exercise and only buy 20 shares of stock? No. If you can't afford to exercise, then you can sell your option to someone else.\n\nExpiration Date: This is when your call expires. if you have a 3/19 expiration date, that means that your call option is no longer good after 3/19\n\nPremium: The premium is the price you pay to the call-seller for the contract, and it is listed as the price per share. Knowing that, how much will it cost to buy an option with a premium of .25? If you do the math, it will cost you $25, which is .25/share x 100 shares.\n\nITM and OTM: \"In the Money,\" and \"Out of the Money.\" ITM calls are calls for which the stock price has exceeded the strike price. If you have a $400 call, and the price of GME goes to $405, then your call is ITM because you can buy a $405 stock for $400. If you then immediately sold the stock for $405, you'd make money. OTM calls are calls for which the stock price is below the strike price. If you have a $400 call and the price of GME is $350, then your call is OTM. It is important to realize that being ITM doesn't mean being profitable. In the example above of the $400 call with a $2 premium, if GME goes to $401, you are ITM because 401&gt;400, but you haven't broken even yet because your break-even price is $402.\n\nFDs: FD is not an investment term, and you don't need to know what it means in order to understand calls. It is a WSB term, and it stands for maggot's delight (but with an F, because autmod won't let me define FDs). FDs are OTM calls with short expirations, and as such are a huge gamble. [The guy who spent 90k on 1dte \\(1 \"day to expiration\"\\) OTM GME calls?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3r3v2/found_out_how_to_buy_call_options_yesterday/) Those were all FDs, and they all expired worthless. Why are they called FDs? Because when you buy FDs, you usually end up taking it in the ass.\n\nWHEN PEOPLE LIST THEIR OPTION POSITIONS, THEY USE A BUNCH OF NUMBERS AND LETTERS THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND. HOW DO I FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT\n\nYou have probably seen something like this: GME $400c 3/19. Let's break it down.\n\nGME $400c 3/19 - The GME stands for Gamestop, which you probably figured out. The $400c is a call option with a strike price of $400. If it said $400p, it would be a put option, but we'll talk about those later. The 3/19 stands for the expiration date.\n\nNow let's make it more complicated. If I said, \"I bought 10 $5 GME $800c 3/19,\" what do I mean?\n\nIt means that I bought ten contracts of GME $800 calls with a 3/19 expiration, and I paid $5 per share. If I paid $5 per share, how much did I spend on my contracts? I spent $5,000 ($5/share x 100 shares x 10 contracts).\n\nNow you try it. A $700 call on GME that expires next week costs around seven bucks a share. How would you explain to me that you bought two of them?\n\nYou would say that you bought 2 $7 GME $700c 3/19. Now you can look like you know what you're talking about even though you still probably don't.\n\nWHY DO PEOPLE BUY CALL OPTIONS?\n\nThis is confusing. Why do people even do this? People buy call options because you can make a lot of money. If you have the right to buy 100 shares of something for a fixed price, then for every $1 the share price goes above your break-even price, you make $100. If you have a $400c with a break even of $402, and the price gets to $412, then you make $1,000 profit. That's $10 of profit ($412-$402) times 100 shares. You can buy the shares and hold them, or you can buy them and sell them immediately to realize that profit. Or you can sell the contract to someone else and just take the money. It is usually better to sell the contract, but that's not an important distinction because most of you can't afford to exercise anyway, and will be selling contracts.\n\nWHY ARE CALLS DANGEROUS?\n\nWhen you buy a stock, at least you own the stock. If you buy an option and it expires worthless, then you have nothing. If the guy who bought 90k worth of FDs had bought 90k worth of GME and held, then he'd still have somewhere around 90k worth of GME, +/- 5% depending on when he bought on Thursday. Instead, he has nothing.\n\nWHY DOES THE VALUE OF MY CALL KEEP CHANGING\n\nSo you bought a call option, and every time you look at it it's worth a different amount of money. That's because there are actually two types of value in an option: options have Intrinsic Value, and Extrinsic Value.\n\nIntrinsic Value is the exercisable value of the option, If you own a $400c, and the price is $412, then the intrinsic value of the option is $12/share, or $1200, because that's the value you would get if you exercised it right now. as stock price goes up, intrinsic value goes up. Pretty easy.\n\nExtrinsic Value has a more complicated definition, so we're going to call Extrinsic Value the potential the option has, and that potential is based on time and volatility. For example, if there is a long time before expiration, then that means that there is more potential for the option to go ITM, because more time = more chances for the price to rise. Therefore, options further from expiration will be worth more than options close to expiration. Conversely, less time to expiration = less value, which means that your option can constantly lose value as time goes on and the number of chances you have to go ITM decreases. This is called theta decay, but you don't need to worry about that.\n\nVolatility is the second part of extrinsic value, and options for stocks that are more volatile can be worth more than options for stocks that trade steadily, because if a stock price swings wildly up and down, there's a greater chance that one of those upswings will put you ITM. This is reflected in a measurement called IV, or Implied Volatility. Like Theta Decay, IV is a more advanced concept that you don't need to understand now as long as you get the basics.\n\nDue to the factors of time (theta) and volatility (IV) constantly changing, the extrinsic value of your option will also change over time. This is why the value of your option will constantly change. Is the stock calming down and starting to trade sideways (low volatility)? Your option value will decrease as IV drops. Is the stock starting to jump around? Your option value will increase as IV increases.\n\nSometimes the stock price can be climbing slowly but the value of your option can be decreasing. Why do you think that is? If the stock value is increasing slowly, but you're way OTM and running out of time because your option expires tomorrow, the downward price pressure of theta decay can overcome the upward price pressure of volatility and stock price rise, and your option value can decrease.\n\nI BOUGHT A CALL AND I'M ITM! HOW/WHEN DO I SELL MY CONTRACTS\n\nYou can sell your contracts at any time. You don't have to wait until the expiration to sell your contracts. This is good, because if the price spikes, you can dump your options for profit and move on. There was a point yesterday when 90k FD guy's 275 and 285 calls were ITM when GME spiked to 290. If he had sold then, he wouldn't have lost everything by waiting until expiration.\n\nI BOUGHT A CALL AND I'M ITM! HOW/WHEN DO I EXERCISE MY CONTRACTS\n\nMake sure that you have enough money to cover buying all the shares and click the exercise button. They get your money, and you get their shares. This can take some time.\n\nOK. I GET IT. BUT CAN YOU GIVE ME A TL:DR JUST IN CASE I ACTUALLY DON'T GET IT\n\nA call option is a contract to buy 100 shares of a stock at a certain price. To buy the contract, you pay a premium to the contract seller. If the price of the stock goes above the price of your contract, you can either buy the shares or sell the contract for profit.\n\nThe End.\n\nSO I'M AN EXPERT NOW AND CAN GO YOLO EVERYTHING ON CALLS AND MAKE MONEY?\n\nNo. You have a basic understanding of how calls work and know just enough to be dangerous. Don't go crazy. Buy a call. See how it works for real. Don't YOLO your life savings on your newfound knowledge. Or do. Live your life how you want; I'm not your dad. Just make sure you post the porn when you win or lose.",

        "selftext": "As promised in the discussion thread I would post some updated info on what Friday could bring in terms of ITM options. \n\n**TL;DR** the number of possible contracts ITM could be DOUBLE last weeks expiry. Over 4 million shares could be called on for these exercised options only adding to the ever increasing snowball.\n\n**Here is what I did:** Pulled the option chain data into excel, ran some numbers on open interest and found some crazy info. \n\n**What is a gamma squeeze:** For those who don't know what a gamma squeeze is but have heard it thrown around let me give a brief ELi5. Gamma squeezes revolve around options, I wont go into too much detail here on what those are, but basically you purchase a contract which gives you the option to buy the stock at a set price on a future date regardless of what that stocks current price is. Contracts are typically in lots of 100 shares per. Option contacts are not usually sold by individuals but rather market makers, biggest of whom being option houses out of Chicago. They have a complex price model which values contracts at set prices for said contract based on probability of them becoming ITM (in the money) of course, the higher the stock price for the contract the lower the cost because the odds of that happening is low. These market makers thought GME was garbage and sold way more contracts than they could feasibly handle because what are the odds GME @ $15 goes to $150... Market makers selling these contracts need to buy shares to hedge, which of course will cause that price to rise more and more.\n\n**Now that GME is @ $130:** Today was a great day, GME closed up $8.17 or 6.58% maybe not the crazy gains some hoped for, but on a down market day is pretty incredible. Now a rise in only $8 may not seem like it has much of an impact on gamma squeeze potential but just wait.. \n\n# GME Options Exp. 2021-03-05 (This Friday)\n\n**GME @ $100 (Last Fridays Close, Option Expiry):** At this level going into Friday we could expect **22,427** in open interest in ITM GME contracts this week. That sure is a lot of possible stocks that need to be purchased if those contracts are exercised. About **2,242,700** to be exact or about **4.97%** of the TOTAL FLOAT. Crazy. \n\n**GME @ $130:** We can expect **35,989** contracts to be ITM if tomorrow closes above $130. A solid **13,562** more contracts than at the $100 level. This equates to **3,598,900** shares or **7.97%** of total float. Now we're getting nutty.\n\n**What about GME @ $150:** Closing Friday above this level brings thousands more contracts ITM. In fact, closing above this price means there would be **46,397** contracts ITM. This means that a whopping **4,639,700** shares or **10.27%** of total float. **MORE THAN DOUBLE @ $100**\n\n**What does this mean?** Well not every contract will be exercised, even ITM. These market makers have also likely been finding shares to hedge for some time now as well. But its entirely impossible to ignore that if every contract were to be exercised, **10%** of all the shares in circulation would be needed and if anyone knows anything about supply and demand, it means more contracts will come ITM next week, and then more again the week after and so on. With the steady price rise we've been seeing, it could be these market makers are slowly buying up shares to hedge, COULD is operative and this is entirely speculation. What we do know is that MASSIVE amounts of money have been changing hands over this past week in GME. There's been crazy volume at times, particularly today, the day before contract expiry. Any how, ill put away my tinfoil hat. What we could be witnessing is the beginning of the beginning, the first domino's. \n\nDoes this information guarantee the stock takes off to the moon and beyond? No not really, but it sure does increase the odds of that happening. We probably cannot even fathom how these market behemoths are willing to protect themselves. We all saw what happened with RH, and whats crazy is its possibly the tip of the iceberg for actions they took, its just the action that we were able to see. \n\n**Summary:** Since last Friday (2021-02-26, last option expiry) the number of contracts possibly ITM has **DOUBLED** I repeat **DOUBLED.** If tomorrow closes above $150 and every contract is exercised **10%** of total float will be called on. Even if nothing happens tomorrow and we close @ $130 there is still **50%** more contracts ITM than last week. All of this continues to build that snowball that's started to get mighty big. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIll say it again for those in the back ***DOUBLED*****.**\n\nMic drop. \n\nNot financial advice, this is just for fun.\n\nAny questions feel free to ask away!",

You could say... I LIKE the mod team.*\n\nWhy did we not get transparency about how g\u00e6mstonk megathreads were going to be handled, ahead of time?\n\nFirst, the thread wasn't made.\n\nThen the threads made by users were being manually deleted.\n\nThen we got a comment stickied to the top of the daily thread saying words to the effect of \"no more g\u00e6mstonk daily threads, more news later.\"\n\nThat comment got deleted.\n\nThen we're told \"it's because interest in g\u00e6mstonk has died down\" (???????? Do you people LOOK at your own subreddit?)\n\nThen RKT gets a sticky. It gets MASS brigaded by the rightly fucked off g\u00e6mstonk pushers.\n\nThen we get told that the mods simply \"forgot\" to make the g\u00e6mstonk thread.\n\nThen finally, it was because Opinion forgot to set an alarm.\n\n...\n\nWhat. The. Fuck. Is. Going. On?\n\nYou don't want people to believe in conspiracies? Act homogeneously and transparently.\n\nI haven't seen ANY good DD on g\u00e6mstonk for DAYS even though there is TONS of important movement going on with it. Somehow RKT is the ONLY majorly mentioned DD ticker on Monday? Somehow *that alone justifies a sticky?*\n\nThat precedent is extremely dangerous. I hope you have highly competent tools that protect against vote manipulation and spam... because if all it takes is a single highly rated post and ticker the day before to earn a sticky the following day... you leave the entire subreddit vulnerable.\n\nAs a side note... Everyone believes 3/19 is the MOASS date... BUT OPEN INTEREST IN g\u00e6mstonk IS HIGHER THIS FRIDAY. THIS. FRIDAY.\n\nI am extremely bullish on GME and in my opinion this is the second best time to buy. It can't only go up. But if momentum is there... it can. I doubt MM's have delta'd for 200. 250. 300. 350... for this Friday, because right now it's limping at 115. And there are 24,000 calls at 800 for Friday. That is just ASTRONOMICAL.\n\nMovement is best THIS WEEK.\n\nNobody knows it... because all the front page g\u00e6mstonk text posts are just straight dumpster garbage. Zero information. All fluff. And people wonder why they think it's a dead play, a dumb play. \n\nI don't want to believe asinine theories like top-down manipulation. So some clarity on this is going to deeply alleviate that poisonous sentiment.\n\nEdit: there is a mod reply, please don't downvote it.\n\nEdit 2: this is a really good time to remind retail that... we are a significant force. Decoherent, stupid, self destructive... but sometimes even a room full of monkeys all throw their shit in the same direction. So just be more conscious of what that direction is.\n\nEdit 4: I censored the ticker to avoid spam from bots. Guess it worked. Had hardly any (like one?) Emoji/stupid comment.",

This is purely my opinion and these numbers have not been audited.**\n---\n**Round 2**: Ding, ding, ding. Here's my previous [analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lspbb5/gme_dd_analysis_of_options_expiry_on_226_and/)\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR**: The data indicates that squeezes could be on the way.\n\n---\n**Analysis**\n\nCurrently: Roughly $227m in value, or 11.6m shares, (call-put) are in the money. \n\n* At each $10 threshold up to $150/share, approximately 1m shares come into the money at each increment. \n* At $160/share, approximately 2m shares come into the money.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSince rate of delta change is the highest around each strike price (meaning gamma is also largest). It would lead me to believe that a ton of shares will need to be bought to hedge these positions as these share price amounts are passed (creating a sequence of gamma squeezes).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**If price were to squeeze up to $810/share (~56b market cap): \n\n* The net calls in the money would exceed the float.** This is insane! Even if calls were covered on the way up by buying the underlying, it's not possible to cover more than 100% of float\n* 8m shares would come into the money creating a huge gamma squeeze\n* This in turn would create a massive short squeeze (even if current short reporting is accurate, which is somewhat questionable at this point, there are more net calls alone that need to be covered to exceed float, which means shorts would be squeezed not just because of the price, but also because of share lenders calling shares. P.S. - Not sure how this works, so would like to hear others weigh-in if they understand this better)\n* Really, hitting this price seems like it would create a squeeze of epic

The hedgies are seeing our cards and folding just to prolong this squeeze.\n\nWe just need to continue to be patient and buy what we can afford and most importantly HOLD! \n\nThe numbers are on our side. All they are trying to do is cause fear and doubt. They NEED OUR SHARES!\n\nThis is not financial advise, this is \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83e\udd8d advice.",

Nope, they knew this was going to happen and published it to add to the fire after the hedge funds told them so.

        "selftext": "I swear to god, the GMEAnon futzes LOVE to say. \u201cThis stock is going to hit X price on Y date because of Z calculation, so long as the mark is above [arbitrary number] at market close.\u201d\nDoes no one remember what happened the week after RobinHood banned buying of GME? Seriously. There was this mass belief among those of us long on GME (and I should know, I believed in it) that SO LONG as the ticker closed above $320 on Friday, we would wake up Monday morning to the squeeze of all short squeezes.\n\n\nAnd Monday morning in pre-market and all during the day we look at the stock, and lo and behold, the MOASS happened, and every single person who ever bought GME sold it for a price greater than $1000, and world peace was realized because the wealth had been redistributed through the markets for the first time in history.\n\n\nNo. It began the fall down to $40, which it finally hit towards the end of the month. Sure, it\u2019s back above $100 per share, but that date was wrong and dangerous and a lot of people lost a lot of money.\n\n\nLook, I\u2019m long on GME. I believe there\u2019s a possibility of a short squeeze. But the cultier the message becomes, the more ANGRY people are that other tickers are mentioned:\n\n\n&gt;RKT is just a hedge fund attempt to distract people from GME, just like SLV was.\n\n\nThat\u2019s a great point, buddy. Say, have you looked at their charts? Do you understand the fundamental difference between the mortgage industry and a ticker that purports to be backed by actual silver but isn\u2019t?\n\n\nOh, and let\u2019s talk about the gross overestimation of WSB\u2019s power. It is literally impossible for this subreddit to P*mp and D*mp. Every good trade, every time a ticker pops off, it is because of institutional power and pressure and market conditions. When people make money off of these things, it\u2019s because they\u2019re riding that train, not conducting it. No P*mp and D*mps are baked into the rules. Do you not trust u/zjz? What\u2019s wrong with you. The market cap on tickers mentioned here has to be above a certain number to explicitly prevent p*mping and d*mping.\nDon\u2019t believe me?\n\n\nWhy isn\u2019t PLTR at 50 then? No, seriously, why has it never hit $50 per share. They had a great earning last week. All over the subreddit people said it would hit $50.\n\n\nIn fact, if WSB is so damn important and powerful, how come GME spent almost an entire month below $60 per share in February?\n\n\nToday could be a very good day. It could also be a very bad day- for whatever tickers you are invested in.\n\n\nThere are lots of great reasons to be long in GME outside of a potential short squeeze, and I personally think the stock is undervalued until it reaches a price of close to $200 per share, but I also think it will be incredibly volatile before that.\n\n\nI also think it won\u2019t earn that price target organically for two to three years. I think Ryan Cohen can successfully transform the company, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m long on GME.\n\n\nSo, rather than convincing yourselves that you know everything, that it\u2019s all going to work out in a specific way at a certain date because of THIS INFORMATION, why don\u2019t you relish in the fact that you don\u2019t know. Because I certainly don\u2019t. I don\u2019t know anything. I\u2019m a fucking idiot who makes financial decisions based off of gut feelings and the things I\u2019ve read on a subreddit filled with other idiots.

Some say this makes the potential peak of GME share price infinite. Anything above $500,000/share (please correct me if I am wrong) could crash the global economy.\n\nThe impacts on the global economy will be massive, as shorts are required to liquidate Trillions of dollars out of diversified portfolios, resulting in a massive crash of prices all across the stock market. They will have to lean into credit as well, drawing potentially hundreds of billions to trillions in loans from banks, private lenders, and corporate and individual investors.\n\nFor a few weeks, we could see the entire global stock market drop by over 80%, as literally trillions of dollars trade hands, moving from Hedge Funds, banks, credit lines and money lenders into the pockets of retail traders.\n\nThis is terrifying not only to Hedge Funds but to everyone as they begin to realize the implications.\n\nLeading valuation companies like Apple, Amazon, Walmart, Tesla, Facebook, etc., could have their value cut in half overnight, smaller companies could go bankrupt, and the list of world billionaires could be changed entirely.\n\nIf this happens, not only will Gamestop become the world's highest-valued company, but anyone investing in the company could pocket millions, even billions of dollars. If this happens, we will be in a position to move this new wealth back into the companies that most deserve it, funding companies that have a vision and drive to make the world a better place, and fueling a new era of development on this planet.\n\nThe money that we earn could resolve the climate crisis, eradicate poverty and global hunger, advance medical science, introduce a UBI and equalize the global standard quality of life, retrofit cities, regenerate the environment and ensure a livable future for all life on Earth.\n\nQuoting Elon Musk, \"History loves irony, and the most entertaining outcome is the most likely.\"\n\nPlease let me know if I am completely off my rocker.

Pretty squeezable if you ask me.\nhttps://www.highshortinterest.com\n\nAnd for all you GME Tards out there downvoting this... MELVIN CAPITAL IS BETTING AGAINST THIS STOCK. HERE ARE THE PUTS THEY OWN\nhttps://fintel.io/so/us/skt/melvin-capital-management-lp\n\nSmall market cap: As of today this company is worth 1.52 billion. $RKT Market Cap moved from approximately $40bn to $80bn in two days this week, and arguably has more upside to go. If $SKT market cap were to increase the same amount, it\u2019s a 27x BAGGER!!!!! This stock can LITERALLY go to $400+ based on previous experience alone, AND there\u2019s much higher SI. \n\nBuilding Awareness: I set myself up for $RKT and $GME by getting in ahead of the general curve. I am 2/2 on meme stocks so far, and this sweet sweet baby is sitting right in our wheelhouse. I watched as it started to shudder AH yesterday\u2026 and I knew it was time to bust out the vaseline but my wife\u2019s boyfriend already used it all. \n\nCommon sense: Does anybody really think shopping centres are going to be a thing of the past?? If I\u2019m spending my tendies to buy clothes I\u2019m sure as hell going to try them on. Sentiment is changing FAST. All lagging stocks have finally started booming, Texas dropped restrictions, $SKT go BOOOM \ud83d\ude80\n\nOpen Interest: the call to put ratio is looking TASTY as of late. Lots of new calls being opened, and puts are down.\nhttps://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/SKT/options?p=SKT\n\nThe name: I predict Lil\u2019 Jon will be the number one artist of 2021 when this mafucka leaves the stratosphere. Worth a buy just for the memes\n\nMisc info for your reading pleasure: \n\n* Quarterly Dividend of 4.33% implies health and balance sheet strength. Also free tendies.\n* Price action steadily climbing since March 2020 crash. SUPER healthy chart movement over 1yr. Can\u2019t believe it\u2019s even shorted right now tbh, those HF\u2019s must already be lighting money on fyre. \n* Brick and mortar isn\u2019t going anywhere\n* Some guy on here said he drove by a mall and the parking lot was full\n\nTL;DR this is the next $RKT but\u2026. dare I say better? \n\nResume and disclaimer:\n\nI hit 732.67% gains on $RKT calls bought this week. I sold at $33 like a PAB but got in way ahead of the curve. \n\n$SKT Positions:\n4/16 20c \n4/16 25c\n\nAnd fuck it. If this hits $250 WSB can vote on my tattoo.\n\nWelcome to the next. Big. SHORT.

Please find below the proof that this article was not only RELEASED PRIOR TO THE DROP... But even written AT LEAST 14 hours beforehand. How long has this been scheduled??? \n\nYes this little rat has sold his soul. But who is giving the orders? He went private on his twitter and deleted his posting of the article. \n\n1. Proof \nhttps://twitter.com/MrDavidNIO/status/1369733681259053061?s=19\n\n2.

How can they play us like absolute fools, right before our eyes. With conclusive proof of a rigged media, it just makes me even more hellbent on winning this fight.\n\nHold strong you fucking apes. This only invigorates further outrage. \n\nHuge credit to @MrDavidNio for his detective work. I am just the ape hoping this message gets to you retards. \n\nTLDR: Market Watch has been exposed in producing news about the GME drop today. They released the article 14 hours before hand as shown through a Google search of the article. It was even published prior to the drop.

        "selftext": "So my ~~colleague~~ wifes boyfriend, who has no reddit account and wishes to have no association with you autists, has been doing some maths (or math for you americans) in an attempt to back solve Short interest, using short volume &amp; trading volume. The base idea behind his findings was that any short volume over 50% cannot be 100% covered that day... so he just thought - how much can these short boys actually cover, if all shorts opened were intended to be covered...\n\nHere's what he's worked out spoiler alert:&gt;!shorts r more fuk than bears!&lt;\n\n\"So, I have been freaking the fuck out about this.  I am of the belief that at one point, FINRA said the truth about SI%... Being 226% on the 15th of january.  I had thought it was impossible to figure out what it was now, but then I started digging into the Short Volume to my attention.\n\nAt first, I had thought that it would be interesting if we could see how much they could have covered if 100% of long volume transfers went to covering shorts (Short Overflow)...\n\nSo then, I got a thought... let me manually import the short volume data since the 15th and see where this could go.\n\nSo from the FINRA report I got:\n\n* Short Volume\n* Short Exempt Volume\n* Exchanged Volume (Long Volume + Short Volume)\n\nFrom Yahoo Historical Data I got:\n\n* Total Trade Volume\n* Day's Closing\n* Day's low\n\nThen I calculated this: Total Short Volume (SV + SEV)\n\n* Long Volume (ExV - SV)\n* SV% (TSV / EV)\n* Off Exchange Volume (TV - EV)\n* Short Overflow (TSV - LV)\n\nI realized that this all cost them a fuck ton.\n\nSo I said:  If they covered through calls, then they as an extreme minimum paid 40$/share for them AND only would do so when GME was on the way up as it would be a waste of money otherwise. Thus I made MinimalCost of OFF-Exchange as (OEV \\* $40).\n\nIf they covered through Long Volume on market, then we'd be able to estimate that CONSERVATIVELY by comparing the days low to the Daily long volume (Day's Low \\* LV).\n\nThen came to the conclusion of the data:\n\nI wrote down the FINVIZ float, the SI% from FINRA, and derived the Short Volume at the time. THEN, I made 3 tables:\n\n* Table 1: Shows how many Shorts are there at different intervals of covering on Off-market and On-market.\n* Table 2: Shows the cost of doing those coverings.\n* Table 3: Shows the new SI%.\n\nIN CONCLUSION:   Using My data, I was able to derive that the **535.9% SI%** being passed around would cost Short Sellers 25 BILLION DOLLARS theoretically.\n\nThe **Maximum SI% can be rn is 942.06%.**\n\nIt is **litterally impossible for it to be under 200% rn** as it would be too costly.\n\nI believe that SI% is over 600%, as I believe that certain companies ran while they could, spending 10 billion dollars AT MOST between them all for covering.\n\nNOTE: NONE OF THIS EVEN TAKES INTEREST INTO ACCOUNT FOR THEIR COSTS, IT IS ALL JUST THEORETICAL COVERING COSTS ALONE. THE DATA DOES NOT SUPPORT THEM HAVING COVERED MUCH AT ALL, YOU TAKE FROM THIS WHAT YOU WILL. I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR DONT COME BITCHING.\"\n\nThank you for coming to his TED talk.   \n\n\n**TL:DR SHORTS CAN'T STOP WONT STOP SHORTING. WE GOING TO THE EDGE OF THE UNIVERSE \ud83d\ude80**",

        "selftext": " \n\n*Welcome back and it feels good to be writing up posts again. I was asked to write up the recent relation between ETF's and the GME dip's we've been witnessing in the last several trading days.* ***I have included a TLDR for the crayon eating apes with an attention span of a 2-month-old dog. Also due to wsb guidelines, i am unable to mention these etf tickers due to their market cap. Please bear with me (not the \ud83d\udc3b\ud83c\udf08)***\n\nAnyone questions? Feel free to DM and I'll respond in 10-15 working days (jk)\n\nHedge Funds covering up $GME shorts through ETF cloaking\n\n*I would like to present a few common terminologies before starting this post which may aid in helping you apes comprehend this more clearly.*\n\n**Exchange-Traded Funds (ETF)-** An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of security that tracks an index, sector, commodity, or another asset, but which can be purchased or sold on a stock exchange the same as a regular stock. An ETF can be structured to track anything from the price of an individual commodity to a large and diverse collection of securities. ETFs can even be structured to track specific investment strategies. You can consider them as a hybrid of mutual funds.\n\n**Short Selling-** Short selling is the process of selling shares that you don't own, but have instead borrowed, likely from a brokerage. Most people short sell shares for two reasons:\n\n1. They expect the share price to decline. Short-sellers hope to sell shares at a high price today and use the proceeds to buy back the borrowed shares at a lower price sometime in the future in a bid to profit.\n2. They want to hedge or offset a position held in another security. For example, if you have sold a [put option](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/put.asp), an offsetting position would be to short sell the underlying security.\n\n**Authorized Participants -** An authorized participant is an organization that has the right to create and redeem shares of an exchange-traded fund (ETF). They provide a large portion of the liquidity in the ETF market by obtaining the underlying assets required to create the shares of an ETF. When there is a shortage of ETF shares in the market, authorized participants create more. Likewise, as ETF borrow costs increase, APs are less likely to borrow shares to hedge their position, and more likely to fail-to-deliver.\n\nIn a typical transaction, the borrower of a stock posts collateral of 102% to 105% of the shares' value in cash, government securities or a bank letter of credit. If the ETF needs to sell the stock, it can recall it from the borrower. But if the borrower for any reason isn't able to deliver the shares, the ETF is repaid through the collateral instead, although that can have adverse tax consequences for the ETF.\n\n**$GME relationship: Let's look at the past trend of an ETF with GME**\n\nNow I'm not claiming today's red day was entirely due to etf's being shorted or their shares being lent out, but there is significant evidence that leads me to believe this may be one of the key factors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Notice how the assets plummet suddenly after the first short squeeze?](https://preview.redd.it/ge6epulq4bn61.png?width=688&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b84a08585e0d2b57f4cab485d2ae0b466c42605)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*By law, a fund can have no more than one-third of its total assets in securities on loan. Few ETFs or other funds ever reach that ceiling, and ETFs are considered to be more conservative lenders than other funds. Market makers are continually creating new ETF shares (by presenting the fund with a basket of securities represented in the ETF) and redeeming others (and getting the underlying securities in return), so the number of ETF shares outstanding fluctuates. Because the supply isn't fixed, there really is no impact on performance when an ETF is net short, industry participants say. The prices of ETF shares typically stay very close to the value of the underlying holdings.*\n\n***ETF shares borrowed today saw significant lending. Suspicious, isn't it?***\n\nCredit to [u/hkzor](https://www.reddit.com/u/hkzor/) for providing these images:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ETF 1: 6.5M available last week to 4M today](https://preview.redd.it/0vkjixsk4bn61.png?width=387&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4160a26d935c7e32ceb0947872a9be36b42417b1)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ETF 2: 1.3M available last week to 850k today](https://preview.redd.it/upqsjgpl4bn61.png?width=388&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c94b5ed3dd2b2426dacbcd5a9564bd226dc48e8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ETF 3: 900k last week to 500k today](https://preview.redd.it/fxca18jm4bn61.png?width=434&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9052e6bba2197671977783472dde2f9e14388f9f)\n\nJust taking into account **Three** ETF lendings, **you could see 3.35 Million shares were borrowed in today's trading session.**\n\nShort Sellers effectively manipulate pricing by borrowing shares in a company in order to sell them with downward pressure, coupling it with High-Frequency Machines being used, the price of a security can significantly drop in a rapid succession as we've been witnessing for the past few trading days.\n\n**The HF's have most likely synthetically shorted GME via ETF's to drive its price down since then**. They can also legally disguise their short position via synthetic longs, and there's concrete evidence that they have done this on the various articles posted before.\n\n**When coupled with synthetic longs via options, gives the appearance of shorts covering when they haven't, takes GME off the threshold security list when it shouldn't be**, and provides the ability to naked short GME again. This was the missing piece of how GME could actually be shorted without appearing so. This solves the NYSE threshold securities issue and the ability to drive GME down outside of buying a put.\n\n**Ultimately they have to cover these shorts sometime or another, if the ETF's recall their shares back that would mean an absolute fuckery of melvin and citadel, given they are still paying massive SI without the numbers actually showing up the threshold index**.\n\nThe Link Between Failure to Delivers and ETF's\n\nETF's are a growing force in financial markets and constitute almost 25% of US equity trading volume, therefore please keep in mind that not all shares shorted with specific ETF's are directly linked to GME. The one's I used as evidence is either because $GME is a major part of their portfolio or the ETF is retail orientated.\n\n**Failure To Deliver -** A condition where two investors agree to the purchase/sale of a security at a given price but the seller fails to deliver the security in a timely manner.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The daily volume of Failure to deliver traded in the past](https://preview.redd.it/h7263a5f4bn61.png?width=588&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7576c75223e5ddf8959093fafaea48d12586046)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ETF's being shorted in the past](https://preview.redd.it/kw9k81jg4bn61.png?width=801&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=976a2e44cdd6327ed13ee81021e913ae02c6ad0f)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nComparing both charts depict how the recent increase in Failure to deliver has had a direct correlation with ETF volume being shorted. Point being? The finance industry has used ETF's as a way of covering up their Failure to deliver's way before $GME. \n\n**Authorized Participant Arbitrage Option: Operational Shorting**\n\nWhen faced with \"excessive buying\" pressure as we have witnessed with $GME, Authorized Participants and Market may sell shares as \"Naked\" and then locate or create the shares at a later time (up to T+6 for bona fide market making). However, delaying past T+3 results in a failure to deliver **but AP/Market Makers are allowed to fail past T+3 because they are \"making markets\" and have an additional three days to settle trades (a total of T+6). This choice of shorting can also lock in a profit if options are used to hedge their exposure but with less capital outlay.** I won't go too in-depth about options hedging in this post because I want to keep the topic on the point of ETF's. However, I see a lot of misconception regarding calls and delta hedging which leads to misinformation being spread.\n\n**TLDR**\n\n**Do NOT WORRY about the price decreasing, this is all synthetically created to kick down the eventual outcome down the road through lending ETF shares and recent data proves that**. **Over 3.5 million shares were lent out through etf's yesterday and their failure to deliver's are accumulating each and every day. It's like maxing your credit card to pay off the debt on your other credit card. Does it solve the issue? No. It only delays it and makes it worse. Secondly, there is no volume to back up the current dip and just goes on to show you how this is all synthetically created to spread FUD. People who cheer for GME being put on the Shortlist need to realise that has no significant impact as hedge funds have other ways or artificially decreasing the price.**\n\n**Can't stop, won't stop.

        "selftext": "I've been a longtime lurker in this sub, even before I grew a pair and started dipping my toes into the market.  The variety of people, the thoroughness of their research, and the veracity with which they defend it, make this place what it is.  \n\nI only began trading as a side hustle at the start of the pandemic (with modest success).  My biggest wins came from WSB.  When the real push on GME started, I was there.  I was a bag holder of GME after January, but my bag wasn't too large  and I liked the stock, so I grew some diamond hands and held.  I started really following the day-to-day threads, reading every piece of financial news I could, watched Bruce eat his bagels, and developed a much deeper understanding of the market in general.  \n\nI don't listen to all the advice I see on here... and I don't blindly trust DD.  \n\nWhy I feel I need to post today:  \nThe mood in this sub has changed drastically over the last 24 hours.  The rift I see between the GME folks and the RKT folks saddens me greatly.  I don't know exactly how I fee about RKT... something just seems too contrived about it.\n\nI've seen some DD that suggests it's a HF ploy to pull people out of GME.  If that's the case, I don't think it will be successful.  GME apes are strong.  You don't just lose your diamond hands on a whim.\n\nI've seen other DD that suggests it's a HF hedge and their using this to boost their capital in order to better defend their position in GME/AMC.  This seems a bit more plausible to me, but I'm  still not 100% convinced.  A lot of people are posting massive gains (sincere congratulations). \n\nWhat conclusion I have come to is this.  If I were a HF or a MM who needed WSB to fracture, I would seed disunity and distrust among the community.  I would send every bot or shill I could in every direction.  Some strongly defending RKT, some tearing it down.  Some screaming GME is dead, while others quietly suggest taking gains from RKT and rolling them into UWMC.  I wouldn't suggest a shit stock that I knew nobody would listen about... I would use my best DD and find something that could tear attention away from GME and tear the community apart.  And unfortunately, I think it's starting to work.  Just reading the daily discussion thread for today is like watching two 3-year-olds argue about what superhero would win in a fight.  \n\nI love this community.  I hope that some of you may read this and that it may make a small difference.  When it comes to money, it's easy to manipulate peoples feelings.  I just hope that in the end, Apes Together Strong is the sentiment.\n\nGood luck today everyone, and thank you.",

        "selftext": "REPOST because I accidently included a relevant YouTube link in an edit (about a DRYS short squeeze) and this caused the automoderator to delete it). Sorry!\n\nAlso, since I got feedback I didn't include enough Emojis, here's a rectification:\n\n \n\n# \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83c\udf19\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50\n\nFirst, let's look at the players involved here.\n\n# The shorts\n\nOn the short side, we have some hedge funds (most notably Melvin and Citadel) who aimed to make money by shorting gamestop, which they saw as a failing brick and mortar store chain.\n\n# The Market Makers (may have some overlap with the shorts)\n\nMarker makers write options (contracts to be allowed to buy (call) or sell (put) shares for a specific price at or before the expiry date). They collect a fee for selling those contracts, but they make the best profit if the contracts expiry worthless, because then they get to keep their fee, and don't need to keep their contract because it wasn't in the money. How does this work? Well, for example when GME was trading around $40, they sold contracts for $800 for the next month or so, never expecting the price of GME to even reach anywhere near $800, so the \"fools\" who bought the options to buy $800 calls for march 12th and march 19 will be left with worthless calls, or so they thought. (More on this later).\n\n# The longs\n\nOn the long side, we have you glorious apes  \ud83e\udd8d \ud83e\udd8d \ud83e\udd8d, Cohen, and competing hedge funds who are smelling blood and do not hesitate to pull the trigger on Melvin and other shorts, especially if they can make some money while doing so.\n\nNow let's look at the actions that have led up to this.\n\nIt all started when the shorts were getting greedy, and with Covid19 thought they could pull the plug on gamestop, which they saw as a failing brick and mortar game store that would go the way of blockbuster. They did not expect gamestop would survive covid, and they did everything in their power to make it so. Shorting the company to the ground, with the goal being to drive the price to $0 for maximum and tax-free profit. It's important to point out that they COULD have covered at $3\\~$4 but DID NOT. If they did not cover at $3 or $4, what makes you think they covered at $40\\~$400? Hint: they didn't. In fact, they even admitted during the congress hearing to not covering by saying that the last peak to $400+ was just a gamma squeeze. In other words they have not even begun to cover yet.\n\n[Then some people liked the stock](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1p4up/a_refresher_on_what_the_is_going_on_with_gme/)\n\n[Some people have calculated that the real short interest in somewhere between 250% and 967%](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m19sa7/true_short_interest_in_gee_em_ee_could_be/). (something like 200 million to 500 million shares short). Some people may think this is insane, but if you do the math, you will see that no matter what FINRA says, it's impossible for short interest to be below 200%, and it's more likely to be around 500\\~600%. It's hard to find reliable data, but if you just look at the volume and price action, it's obvious that the shorts have only INCREASED since January 28th, not decreased. It is mathematically IMPOSSABLE for the shorts to have covered. It simply doesn't add up.\n\n# How the Gamma squeeze will trigger the short squeeze\n\nSome people doubt this could reach $10k or even $100k, just as people doubted it could reach $1000s. But here is why those numbers are not only likely, but MATHEMATICALLY INEVITABLE. (I'm not an expert to so take it FWIW, feel free to call me an idiot, but if I'm right, I'll expect apologies).\n\nFirst, let's look at the option interest (source: [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/option-chain](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/option-chain))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Strike|Open interest March 12th|Open interest 19th|Shares (combined 12+19)|Shares (combined 12+19 cummulative)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|250|3231|2842|607,300|607,300|\n|255|563|0|56,300|663,300|\n|260|1047|542|158,900|822,500|\n|265|303|0|30,300|852,800|\n|270|788|748|153,600|1,006,400|\n|275|1386|0|138,600|1,145,000|\n|280|595|319|91,400|1,236,400|\n|285|303|0|30,300|1,266,700|\n|290|268|299|56,700|1,323,400|\n|295|323|0|32,300|1,355,700|\n|297.5|475|0|47,500|1,403,200|\n|300|7,011|5,389|1,240,000|2,643,200|\n|302.5|131|0|13,100|2,643,200|\n|305|276|0|27,600|2,683,900|\n|307.5|77|0|7,700|2,691,600|\n|310|660|307|96,700|2,788,300|\n|312.5|106|0|10,600|2,798,900|\n|315|683|0|68,300|2,867,200|\n|320|406|908|131,400|2,998,600|\n|325|313|0|31,300|3,029,900|\n|330|374|264|63,800|3,093,700|\n|332.5|130|0|13,000|3,106,700|\n|335|124|0|12,400|3,119,100|\n|337.5|48|0|4,800|3,123,900|\n|340|587|244|83,100|3,207,000|\n|345|622|0|62,200|3,269,200|\n|350|1876|2426|430,200|3,699,400|\n|355|122|0|12,200|3,711,600|\n|360|1151|344|149,500|3,861,100|\n|365|78|0|7,800|3,868,900|\n|370|103|351|45,400|3,914,300|\n|375|106|0|10,600|3,924,900|\n|380|290|396|68,600|3,993,500|\n|385|112|0|11,200|4,004,700|\n|390|354|508|86,200|4,090,900|\n|395|223|0|22,300|4,113,200|\n|400|3527|5156|868,300|4,981,500|\n|405|189|0|18,900|5,000,400|\n|410|173|258|43,100|5,0043,500|\n|\ud83c\udf3f\u2697\ufe0f|605|1246|185,100|5,228,600|\n|430|211|130|34,100|5,262,700|\n|440|176|176|35,200|5,297,900|\n|450|558|604|116,200|5,414,100|\n|460|276|129|40,500|5,454,600|\n|470|215|210|42,500|5,497,100|\n|480|156|323|47,900|5,545,000|\n|490|166|314|48,000|5,593,000|\n|500|3,149|7,122|1,027,100|6,620,100|\n|510|259|496|75,500|6,695,600|\n|520|393|714|110,700|6,806,300|\n|530|252|168|42,000|6,848,300|\n|540|129|161|29,000|6,877,300|\n|550|490|1557|204,700|7,082,000|\n|560|198|218|41,600|7,123,600|\n|570|305|194|49,900|7,173,500|\n|580|94|615|70,900|7,244,400|\n|590|87|272|35,900|7,280,300|\n|600|1715|2065|378,000|7,658,300|\n|610|99|180|27,900|7,686,200|\n|620|117|153|27,000|7,713,200|\n|630|98|112|21,000|7,713,200|\n|640|326|250|57,600|7,791,800|\n|650|464|456|92,000|7,883,800|\n|660|320|147|46,700|7,930,500|\n|680|198|289|48,700|7,979,200|\n|700|1189|1264|245,300|8,224,500|\n|720|210|299|50,900|8,224,500|\n|740|307|239|54,600|8,330,000|\n|760|659|358|101,700|8,431,700|\n|780|1936|1060|299,600|8,731,300|\n|800|22,244|27,686|4,993,000|13,724,000|\n\nNow, it's important to mention that the MMs will try to stay delta-neutral. In other words, they will start buying BEFORE the price hits strike price. When the MMs sold $800 strike options while the price was at $40, they calculated it would be a 1 in a million chance or something really low that GME would hit $800 by march 12th. However, now, that chance is approaching 1% and climbing. The MMs still don't need to cover fully, but they are starting to consider the CHANCE of it happening is becoming more and more likely. So for each option (remember each option is 100 shares) they may be already buying 1 share per option for the 1% chance of it happening. But this very act may CAUSE it to happen.\n\nAt some point, this is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Because MMs are 'insuring' their bets by buying shares just in case the price goes up, the price actually goes up, which means they need to insure even more, which creates a snowball effect. All the way up to, or beyond, the last option, which is at strike price $800.\n\nSimilarly, the MMs probably considered it about maybe 5% likely that GME would hit 300 this week, but now it's more like 95% like, which means for each option contract with STRIKE 300, they will be buying 90 shares BEFORE the price hits 300 (which means about a million shares bought, which may actually cause the price to reach 300 in the first place!) They do this because they will be worse off when they have to buy in AFTER the price reached PAST 300 (then they will DEFINITLY make a loss). At least if they buy in BEFORE the price reaches $300, they can still make a profit or at least cut their losses.\n\nRemember, all parties are TRYING to make money, but not all of them succeed. So MMs are the ones driving the rally you have seen for the past few days, and looking at the above table, this will likely push the price towards, and likely over $800 either this week, or next week.\n\nYou can also see in some particular numbers there's a LOT of shares that need to be covered, expect a lot of action when we APPROACH those numbers (for example, $300, $350, $400, $420, $500 and of course $800) as you can see, some of those numbers are close, and a gamma squeeze looks inevitable at this point.\n\n# This is only the GAMMA SQUEEZE. Now what about the short squeeze?\n\nSome people ask: \"Why don't the shorts just wait for the rally to be over, and buy when the price drops back to normal levels?\" Simple answer: they can't. Melvin was already down 53% the last time and they didn't even cover (that was just a gamma squeeze, by their own words). When a hedge fund has a short position, they can keep that position, as long as they have enough other assets to cover themselves. If the price of the asset they are short increases drastically (like in the event of a gamma squeeze), they will be FORCED to buy. As an example, let's say Hedge Fund M has $100 billion worth of assets, and shorts Company G for $1 billion at $10 per share. Now the price goes to $1000 per share, so they need to cover $100 billion for their shorts. This is an unacceptable risk, as their shorts are now losing more money than their entire portfolio can cover. So they will be forced to liquidate their assets and buy the shares they shorted. However, this very act will drive up the price (if you want to know how, read up on order books and slippage, this post is getting long enough as it is).\n\nIn fact, this would usually happen long before they reach the point of bankruptcy, but seeing as Melvin managed to lose 53% and still didn't cover, it seems likely Melvin is too stubborn to cut their losses, and will ACTUALLY go bankrupt. This will leave the responsibility to cover with the clearing houses. The clearing houses are sure as hell not going to gamble (I'm pretty sure that's illegal). So the clearing houses would cover IMMEDIATLY, regardless of costs. Even if the feds literally has to print the money out of thin air. So TL;DR, it's a short squeeze because the shorts are FORCED to buy back their shorts, one way or another. Since they need to buy back hundreds of millions of shares (while only about 50 million or fewer are available) this will be \"name your price\" kind of prices. This is where $100k is NOT a meme.\n\n# IMPORTANT LAST POINT:\n\n**Don't lose hope when the squeeze does not happen this week or the next, there are still lots of other triggers that can happen in the near future. Remember, it doesn't cost us anything to HODL, but it does cost them a lot to SHORT. Every day they are losing MILLIONS. Every day we keep the price above $0 is a WIN for us.**\n\nEdit: those who still doubt $100k because it would make the market cap too high, DRYS went to $1.5 BILLION PER SHARE during a short squeeze. Let that sink in.",

It is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security's price. The **MACD** is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. I'll explain this in a much more simpler way later on in this post with nice lines.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**THE RSI**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe RSI or Relative Strength Index is  a momentum indicator used in technical analysis that measures the  magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold  conditions in the price of a stock or other asset. This is generally measured between the numbers 70 and 30. The higher the RSI gets to 70, the more overbought the security is considered. The lower to 30 it is, the closer it gets to being in what is called oversold territory. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow i know some of you might have some crayons in your nose rn preventing some wrinkles from forming so this is where you are going to want to pay attention.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[current RSI and MACD](https://preview.redd.it/qurwnd2x57q61.png?width=546&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b11dabddb3c430d4a7be6b9fd6a9ed8dc110dd6)\n\nSo in this pic above, is the current MACD and RSI on the 1 day time frame. The RSI shows it is about 50, which is neutral. meaning it is not overbought or oversold. The MACD on the bottom is the real important kicker. You see how close those lines are together right now? Got damn that is what makes an Ape cry. This is indicative of a breakout. It has been consolidating around the same price, which deflates the RSI from overbought to neutral. In the bottom the bars going up and down below the midpoint shows the momentum of the security. Obviously red downward means downward trend, and green is vice versa. What is important is the far right how close the lines are.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xxc0xape67q61.png?width=328&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10f67f9e4a093ae8d67ebf00095811fbd4b43522\n\nThis image shows you the MACD and RSI on the \\*last\\* breakout that we had. Back in earlier March it broke up to 348 before being absolutely fucking dumpstered harder than Lebron when he yammed on that one white guy. As you can see, the lines again right before breakout are practically touching. When the volume is almost not even visible above the neutral line, and it's alternating back and forth, the stock is getting ready to either fucking rocket to got damn mars, or tell you what the earth's core is actually made of.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v1hs1l3t67q61.png?width=341&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78546e0cb8cdbf23b62b9cedb4c7518ec212e314\n\nThis is yet again another example of the MACD showing great consolidation, and little to no major movement, and then fucking \\*BAM\\* that shit shoots up faster than a smack addict getting a free score. The close lines and minimal volume is \\*KEY\\*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ae0zxgk377q61.png?width=456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ce4b7b779155d92aa6f8fb4a1c43c7b68a58fd6\n\nThis is when it broke out at the end of January. LOOK AT THIS GOT DAMN MACD AT THE BOTTOM. Do you see how fucking close the lines are? Can you tell what happens next? Of course you know what the fuck happened or you wouldnt even be here reading this trash ass post right now. \n\nThis is not financial advice and i'm just a crayon eating ape trying move up to fucking markers. \n\nTLDR: MACD and RSI says moon soon",

        "selftext": "**TLDR;** Gamestop is undervalued considering its online sales numbers and ecommerce focus - analysts haven\u2019t caught up yet from Q4 Earning report; add on top of that all the hiring of Amazon execs and VPs and Gamestop Valuation is about to explode upward. On its current trajectory $550-750 a share is a reasonable (my worthless opinion) price point, with or without the squeeze. Not only is buying GME a play on the squeeze, but also a deep fucking value bet.\n\nFair warning, you'll develop a wrinkle of two if you proceed... but don\u2019t worry my fellow ape brethren I\u2019ve included charts, with colors, to make visualization easy. Let\u2019s walk through these figures one by one and tell the story of Gamestop\u2019s transition.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n# Chapter 1: Gamestop\u2019s Advantage in its Transition to Online.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the ugly before we get to the good stuff: **Operating Loss**. An operating loss occurs when a company's operating expenses exceed gross profits. Gamestop has had a fairly significant operating loss for many years now (peaking in 2018), as it faced the challenges all brick and mortar stores faced: theft of sales to the e-commerce giants -- the convenience of online downloads and pre-ordering on the internet. In the last two years, this loss has come down significantly. And what impresses me most about Gamestop is their cash on hand (currently $635M). Very few stores with operating losses have that level of cash. Most are in debt, and require the sale of shares to float by during rough times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dyyd0zf7req61.png?width=1544&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3e553bc397243f7b97702eb68d52d1a462c1431\n\nAnd this is the key misstep the HF\u2019s made in shorting Gamestop. There has been a stigma out there about brick and mortar stores going under (Toys R Us, and Sears as example)...  feeding frenzy, blood in the water you get the point. Sharks (HFs) have been getting more and more bold (reckless) in their targeting. Gamestop was the wrong target, for a very specific reason. It leases its stores. By comparison, consider Walmart needing to reduce stores, or Target. They\u2019ve built massive buildings with parking lots to house their very specific store needs (huge upfront costs, sunk), and they rent (or own) these buildings under much different contracts. They can\u2019t easily get up and leave one of their stores. Ask yourself, how would Walmart leave a store? Who would buy it? How could the investor renting to them turn it into something else? Maybe a city might want it to build an expo center. On the cheap. WalMarts costs are priced into this (it\u2019s expensive). They can\u2019t move as easily. Point being, Gamestop doesn\u2019t owe anything to shut down a store, it simply stops paying its lease and moves all it\u2019s stuff out. They rent strip mall locations and mall storefronts. This allows them to liquidate stores and downsize with little to no sunk costs. They can also reposition themselves much more efficiently. This is why we see this fast turn-around in Operating Loss last year (a major component of Operating Loss is storefront costs for Brick and Mortar). News of Gamestop closing stores isn\u2019t bad news. Remember that. The media will try to sell it as such.\n\nBecause of the focus, Gamestop is eyeing Digital Sales, for its future.\n\n# Chapter 2: Digital Sales Growth\n\nIt is clear to everyone, at this point, that Gamestop is looking to move a large portion of its business into the online space. In 2020 Gamestop did $580Million in sales online, and in Q4 alone their online sales represented over 34% of all Gamestop sales; Gamestop did more in online sales in the 4th quarter of 2020 than it did in all of 2019.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/80l9ei8breq61.png?width=1539&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e16f718577f208643498038b3885b21f0e330092\n\nSo what caused this? Ryan fucking Cohen. And he\u2019s just getting started. When we see the sales in 2021 first quarter compared to 2020 the trajectory of this massive shift will become even more apparent. We have only to look at Chewy\u2019s online sales figures under Cohen to project what\u2019s to come for Gamestop in the next few years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rg3g528dreq61.png?width=1565&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c83e58af632d1e9cc06f4e1da6c7df5f9c371f5e\n\nThat\u2019s right, Chewy grew from $205M in online sales to $3,500M (17x) in 3 years under Cohen.\n\nGamestop Announced in it\u2019s Q4 earnings report last week what it\u2019s intentions are... *\u201cOur emphasis in 2021 will be on improving our E-Commerce and customer experience, increasing our speed of delivery, providing superior customer service and expanding our catalogue.\u201d*\n\nWhich brings us to our next chapter on the entire Electronics &amp; Media space in ecommerce -- let's make sense of what potential exists for growth in this sector...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Chapter 3: Electronics &amp; Media Sales\n\nIf you ever wondered where Amazon makes all it\u2019s money. Look no further than the category of Electronics &amp; Media (Gaming, computers, electronics, digital media). In 2020 the company did 120.9 Billion in sales, and 54.6% of that fell into this category. There are plenty of other players in this space, but only Apple is close to Amazon\u2019s market share. Here is a chart to visualize the largest players (Gamestop is #10 currently with their 2020 sales, the tiny orange slice):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/im8t7lwfreq61.png?width=1529&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52e086ce497c34d9e352cfed9fce99f50d2ce723\n\nAmazon itself projects this space to grow 34.2% in the next two years. Meaning roughly $40B in new Electronics and Media sales will emerge in the online space for these companies to grow into over the next two years. Might be a good time to mention that Gamestop listed GPUs for sale on it\u2019s website earlier this week, and they sold out instantly. With Gamestop doing $580M in online sales in 2020, and most of that coming in Q4 it is safe to say Gamestop is positioned to grab onto this space in a way that will shake Amazon\u2019s growth models for the next two years. Have you noticed how Ryan Cohen is leaning on his Amazon (and Chewy) relationships to pull talent to go after this space. If chewy is any indication, I wouldn\u2019t bet against him eventually grabbing a large percentage, even the majority, of it.\n\nSo let\u2019s get to the fun part\u2026 valuation\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Chapter 4: What is Gamestop Worth?\n\nValuations are a funny thing. Companies are only worth what people think someone else will pay for it in the future. Often we start with fundamentals, but in the end, hype and excitement over growth and continued growth leads to higher and higher valuations. I\u2019ll start with a simple comparison just to prove a point.\n\nGamestop ($12B Market Cap) and Roblox ($36B Market Cap)\u2026 we\u2019re all gamers here, right? We know what Roblox is, right? Two completely different companies, but let\u2019s look at the figures anyway and then I\u2019ll get back to comparing GME to the online retail giants. Roblox did $920Million in revenue in 2020 (up from $435Million in 2019), and it\u2019s valuation rose from $4B to $36B. Hmmm\u2026 why? Well, it went public. IPO is a great way to hype a stock. Get people excited, maximize valuation, so those angel investors can finally get paid off. So how does this compare to Gamestop (minus the hype of an IPO). Well Gamestop did $6,466Million in revenue in 2020. Yep, seven times what Roblox did? So why the major difference in Market Cap? Well for one, Roblox has very few employees and no stores to spend money on (is this tickling that little feeling you have about Gamestop\u2019s move to becoming primarily an online ecommerce giant, it should be). If Gamestop were valued the same as Roblox, right now\u2026 it would move it\u2019s price to approximately $5,157 a share. That\u2019s not a squeeze number. That\u2019s simply an IPO hyped valuation number on growth. Gamestop is moving that direction, minus the IPO, but they are aiming to grow (like Chewy did).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img ipbngvoireq61...*\n\nSo let\u2019s get a better comparison to the other giants. Apple, Amazon Chewy, Target, Walmart and Best Buy. I\u2019ve chosen these because they represent a wide range of Brick and Mortar vs ecommerce. Price to Sales Ratio is calculated by dividing the company's market capitalization by the revenue, this gives a general sense of how much the market is going to value a company relative to its revenue. Value players (like Buffet) are often looking for the lowest P/S ratio to enter for a fundamentally solid company, and companies with a lot of growth potential and hype can grow their P/S ratio (similar to P/E ratio) to levels that are very high. One thing you\u2019ll notice in this chart. The more online a company is, the higher it\u2019s P/S ratio can go. This directly impacts the Valuation of the company. While companies that may be online, but still rely most heavily on their stores, have a lower P/S because they have a lot of overhead costs. You\u2019ll notice Gamestop in the middle, because it\u2019s transitioning to ecommerce. Last year you would have seen Gamestop with a P/S similar to Best Buy and Walmart. The reason this is important is because as Gamestop grows it\u2019s online business, it\u2019s P/S is likely to rise, and moving to the Amazon level would represent a share price of roughly double what we currently see for Gamestop, while not changing anything about it fundamentals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Final Chapter: Conclusions\n\nOk you\u2019ve been patient, and I told you I\u2019d eventually get to what Gamestop is worth currently, and next year (projection). What the market hasn\u2019t caught onto yet, that we all see in Gamestop is it\u2019s deep fucking value. So what is Gamestop worth, right now?\n\nWell **$191**, that\u2019s what it\u2019s trading at. It\u2019s only worth more, when people see these numbers and get excited about them. The numbers show that Gamestop is growing exponentially with its online sales and Ryan has brought on a team to accelerate that growth. I don\u2019t know what Q1 numbers are, but I can guess a lot of Apes, are really excited about Gamestop, and becoming more and more loyal to its brand. I know I wouldn\u2019t buy anything from Amazon, that I could get from Gamestop right now, even if it costs slightly more. It\u2019s because of quality, and support for the brand.\n\nLots of things are increasing Gamestop\u2019s valuation, but growth of it\u2019s online sales will be the most significant one. What most analysts are ignoring (or simply missing, if I\u2019m giving them some credit) is just how massive Gamestop\u2019s online sales growth were last year, despite the pandemic. If we project Q4 numbers onto 2021, and ignored the dream team Cohen has brought on board, one can expect 3-4 times as much in online sales next year. That will tip P/S higher and people will stop seeing Gamestop as a failing brick and mortar and recognize it for what it is\u2026 an Amazon killer, going after an $88B market in Electronics &amp; Media by 2023. On top of that, growing an esports brand (I suspect) that will engulf a $200B annual industry that is likely to only grow to $300B by 2023.\n\nProject these figures onto Gamestop as you\u2019d like. I\u2019ll take a stab at it. Right now Gamestop should be valued at $662 a share, based on it\u2019s Q4 figures and projection into 2021 from it\u2019s finish in 2020 Q4. By this time in 2023, we will see Gamestop at a $50B valuation from $12.5B in sales, and a P/S in the 4.0 ballpark - that puts it\u2019s per share price at $795 - conservatively without hyper on the growth (that you know will amplify that by another factor of 2-3). How do we justify a growth from 580M to $12.5B in two years\u2026 Ryan fucking Cohen is how. Multiple current sales by 17. Go back and look at that Chewy graph if you\u2019re wondering how that\u2019s possible. There is a gaping hole in the Electronics ecommerce side of the market, growing. Amazon and Gamestop can both grow incredibly without stealing from one another\u2026\n\nI have another DD in the works on The Squeeze (no dates, no times) and a look at how high we might go (spoiler, there is no accurate answer, but there is a lot to look at, and be excited about to try to make educated guesses).\n\nHere is a teaser\u2026 When Volkswagen Squoze, it temporarily became the most valuable company in the world. Gamestop doing the same, would put it\u2019s price north of $31,800 on it\u2019s way to the moon (not that we heard a bell yet as we flew by that mark).\n\nIf you needed one more reason to HODL, it\u2019s this\u2026 you will be at least 4 times richer a few years from now, even if you went into a Comma and your wife\u2019s boyfriend lost your password couldn\u2019t get to that sell button on the way down from the squeeze, because at $191 a share, GME is still a deep fucking value play squeeze aside.\n\nAnd if you\u2019ve ever wondered how Phineas and Ferb pay for their projects\u2026 I think I figured it out\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/28tift4lreq61.png?width=1303&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=105caf042c76cb6607783b29773e179b2bd1aa45\n\nPlease Be Good To Each Other Out There.\n\nBehind these names we are all humans and we all have our own stories. If you need one more reason to HODL -- I have (had) a terminally ill child (no I do not want anything from any of you) that has a life expectancy of 25ish (she's 9). She survived what was estimated as a 1 in 1000 chance of making it (nine operations and three open heart surgeries as an infant-toddler), which is why she qualified and received a wish from Make-A-Wish (the best damn organization I could have ever hoped for). I have to also give the largest kuddos to this community. On the r/ PoGo board, when I posted about my daughters acceptance by Make-A-Wish to follow her dream of living our Pokemon Go in real life, this community was a critical part of making all that magic come to life. From volunteers who attended the event (400+ costumed members) to connections that got in touch with the animation team in Japan (they drew her a special sketch and all signed the back). Niantic also put UNOWNs of her name into her account after one beautiful soul reached out to someone high up in the org to tell them my daughters story. Why do I bring this up? I want to give my daughter the ability to live out her retirement when she's 18. Travel the world. Experience as much as she can. **If you need one more reason to HODL GME... I'm not selling until I can give her that.**\n\nDon\u2019t lose who you are in the wealth that may (or maybe not) suddenly fall into your lap based on your investing performances. I see mostly fucking amazing souls in this crowd of Apes. Let\u2019s make the world a better place.\n\nNot financial advice.\n\nI don\u2019t know how the stock market works.\n\nI don\u2019t know how companies or their fundamentals work.\n\n**I bashed the keyboard a bunch of times and this popped out.**\n\nThe only thing I know for certain, is I bake a mean crayon pie.\n\nTrying to make Hot Pink a thing in our charting.\n\nWe need more colors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCheers.

Crazy amazing unexpected growth and profitability. The share price went from $19.90 to $21.85... LOL\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bwx447sfjtm61.png?width=594&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e718f52e50d2819d41bc226f160d0f2d00562b8c\n\nSince then\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fbroivvgjtm61.png?width=2093&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=459319c3ad0b896088e1b73b0e1520543769a979\n\nOn March 1st and 2nd the shorts got side-lined by a bunch of WSB interest and the price spiked +71% to $43.\n\nRKT CEO says their share price at $43 is OK but they are still not being fairly valued to peers. (youtube links not allowed)\n\nSo what do the shorts do? They DOUBLE DOWN as they always do!\n\nThey unload millions of new shorts to attack the price:\n\nOn March 4th they have dropped the price to $26.80.\n\n**This chart shows the available short shares to borrow and the fee. On March 4th there are ONLY 100,000 shares available and a HUGE BORROWING FEE OF 59%**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rgtiqziljtm61.png?width=1243&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3979f04d5b95acb8b0a097642ff84bbfe185e553\n\nData from here: [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/RKT](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/RKT)\n\nIn the meantime paper-handed retail investors HAVE SOLD to this very obvious GME tactic once again and there are now more shorts available! These guys are so good at doubling down.\n\n[Market Watch calls Short Interest at 40% on Feb 26th. Since the price went up and they just shorted millions more shares you can bet your sweet bananas short interest is probably higher.](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/rkt)\n\nFrom a technical analysis POV the chart has 3 trailing support lines. In other words the price is very unlikely to dip below $23.50. Your downside is very minimal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ry9hxdfmjtm61.png?width=2118&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2dff7ec2116f2f0de0bfdd5be0a7ae90f6318967\n\nThe morning of March 12th RKT was UP in pre-market. When the market opened there was huge volume and price drove down, killed the momentum and people thought they lost.\n\nDuring that same time MILLIONS of shorts were fired:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q8yr8b5njtm61.png?width=387&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d55b9cbcddae79869becb78017a1832a6b4dfeda\n\nShares available went from 5.6M to 1.9M. Then retail SOLD.... You weak apes.\n\nThe OPEN INTEREST for MARCH 19th OUT THE MONEY IS INSANE.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6pu6cv0ojtm61.png?width=910&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a945e90e1e0dfeeef8d416156dca3c3635a26c3e\n\nCheck out the strike of $30 with 48,889 contracts. On a float of only 100,000,000 (a little bigger than gme) that represents 4,888,900 shares just there (usually MMs will buy 50% or so as it approaches ITM).\n\nIn other words if this gets to $29 it will just keep going up until the highest strike - So above $65 likely.\n\n**That's about a 300% return from current price.**\n\nAlso remember we have the DTCC new rule coming soon, we don't know the date yet but that's making the shorts piss their pants as they would have less liquidity to fight with. They really want to shake out all the retail money at the cheapest price THIS WEEK.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qelq19cpjtm61.png?width=816&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1177d9ce4e4baf2b65056ad52ef14f108b1c7da4\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nRKT is one of the most manipulated prices since IPO. Despite amazing performance, surprise earnings, dividends and buyback announcements the stock has been held under $24.\n\nThe stock is starting to be put on short-selling restricted lists which means shorts are over-risked and brokerages know this.\n\nRKT has a relatively small float with high short interest. It won't take a lot to light the match. The options interest for next week also allows for a big gamma squeeze if the price hits $29 for a sustained period. We're at $25... It's not a lot to ask for.\n\nDisclaimer: This is no financial advice.",

        "selftext": "Yeah, you heard it right, and you most likely know that already, but lemme give you some technical rationale of how this might happen. The analysis is build upon fractal techniques, so that the previous price action is used for making this forecast. Buckle up and eat a Crayon, fellow trader (the word is used as anagram you know for what) as it will help you stay nutrated for the rest of this reading, and it might even help you with the digestion (of the information in the post).\n\nThis is not a financial advice and I am not and a professional advisor, I just enjoy to share my knowledge and educate brainless apes occasionally.\n\n\"BuT whY dO I neEd your FARTCAL ANALizis?!1\"\n\nWell, that's a good question. When I was a young ape living free in the Steppes of Kazakhstan... JK, leave poor Vlad alone for a moment. **The fractal** (from Latin *fractus*) means a steady scalable design of irregular shape emerging on any data. The trade fractal in the financial market is the pattern, formed by a sequence(es) of candles, which has peculiar identifiable characteristics and a tendency to reoccur across different scales and time-frames. Fractals are simple yet important, repetitive formations used by traders to identify and to confirm a trend. Apely speaking, fartcals allow us to forecast the future price action based on the previous similar trends on a given trading instrument.\n\nNow that the captain is gone, let's get to business.\n\n[GME fartcals wroom wroom](https://preview.redd.it/yge17n3k12n61.png?width=2160&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d533ec1fdbcf6443b2233142f87bb285f0c27786)\n\nI know that you all love Crayons with all of your hearts, so I will use rare turquoise and magenta ones in this analysis. Furthermore, I did my best to simplify the method of distinguishing the fractal sequences, using simple lines, and hopefully you should need no more than one brain wrinkle to understand it.  \nWhat you see on the chart (one candle represents 2 hours of price action) above is a perfect example of beautiful fractals. The chart starts from the 11th of January with the turquoise slightly downward tilted consolidation. Next you see a relatively soft magenta upward impulse (14-16 Jan), followed by another turquoise consolidation, this time slightly tilting up and lasting for about three days. Next is where the things really start to get interesting (22nd Jan), as the subsequent magenta upward impulse accelerates exponentially. This accelerection does not go quietly, erupting into a powerful gap (not as big as the one in your head, though). Finally, starting 27th of Jan we have a local endgame highlighted by a purple rectangle with the apex (pay attention to this peak, as it will be used for calculations later) on the 27th of January. 'What? Why purple rectangle?' you may ask. Easy. REKTangles are the Horsemen of the Endgame.  \nThat was only the left part of the chart. Now let's be brief for a moment. There were six main components to the fractal base: turquoise consolidation, magenta uptrend, turquoise consolidation 2, magenta impulse, gap and purple rectangle. What you see on the right, is the original base for the fractal described above meets its bigger brother. Particularly, starting 22nd Feb a very similar chain of price actions manifests. And this is how we really utilize fractals: identify the fractal sequence from the previous data (on the left), and after that apply the pattern to similar market conditions (on the right). Many of the the things look really similar on both sides of the graph, don't they? Coincidence? I think not.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v5s6clts12n61.jpg?width=534&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7e6dcacd9509becc15e1e38a254575986e49063\n\n\"Oh fArtcaLs good Butt WEN MOON?1!\"  \n\n\n[Here you go boy](https://preview.redd.it/f0u97sfv12n61.jpg?width=461&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d64f1f93399d094112b49cf4170475e56ce84bc8)\n\n  \nAllrighty. I know that the energy from the Crayon you ate is running out, so lemme summarize the analysis for this intellectually limited individual with extraordinary small brain capacity that you are. What I need you to do now is what even a half brained chimpanzee is capable of. Count to six (yes, you may use your fingers). Twice.\n\n[Numbers and fractals simplified for dummies](https://preview.redd.it/mfnkdif022n61.png?width=2160&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d2fd1b92e9a7bf6c2bbeb0fac0ed538ea35d96b)\n\n1 = flat line;  \n2 = small magenta hill;  \n3 = line as flat as your wife's girlfriend's tit;  \n4 = accelerection;  \n5 = your brain (aka Gap);  \n6 = Valhala REKTangle / GME go BBBBRRRRRRR  \n\n\nGood boy/girl, you've come this far. Now that your confirmation bias is reinforced, you may get some rest. Or eat another nutritious crayon my brain destitute ape friend, because we are DIVING DEEPER.\n\nOk, it turned out that I needed to eat some Crayons myself, because I really got exhausted writing the post for five hours in a row. So I ate a pack this time, and I am full of GMEnergy. As is the chart below, so bullish, that we will definitely see some GMEnergy explosions in a short time to come. Now the complexity of analysis is going to increase a little bit, but the apes have to evolve at one point in history, so I really encourage you to use this opportunity.   \n\n\n[In-depth fractal forecast](https://preview.redd.it/888zsh3c22n61.png?width=2160&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec2c553761a27dc98efa7dae3de918da0d4f600f)\n\nI hope that you got accustomed to the previous six steps for dummies explanation, and by this moment you should understand the basic principle of how the fractals play. What you see above is a little bit more advanced chart, through which I aim to explain how I came to the price predictions in the post title (finally!). Ok, 1 2 3 4 5 6 is understandable, where did A B come from? The first and most important notice, is that A-B fractals are built upon 1-2-3-4-5-6, and on the chart you can see that A measures 1-2-3-4 pattern, while B covers 5-6 steps of the sequence. A-B on the left (January run) is self explanatory, the fractals are measured as they are. A-B on the right (current price action formation) is where we need some math to get involved, particularly, when we are working with the new B movement prediction. And that is not as difficult as it may seem from a first glance. Again, the main fractal property, re-occurrence, will play on our side. Predicting the price movements, on a volatile market like this one, is one of the most ungrateful things to do, so don't go too harsh on what I am going share with you, apesters. My theory, is that it is possible to predict the amplitude of the upcoming move, using data from previous one. And here, we only need the coefficient from first A-B move. A simple ratio: dividing first B move (about $325 increase) by first A move ($131) gives us a coefficient of about 2,48. Let's apply this ratio to the currently forming fractal: that is multiplying the second A fractal completed height (about $330 based on my prediction, which is built later in this post), which will give the estimated B part of the second fractal height of about $818, landing us on the sweet $1200 dollar level through the next week. Boom, looks beautiful and promising! Fractals, baby!  \n\n\nI hope it has been an entertaining as well as mentally developing read for you so far, smoothie-brainie. But there is still one important part of the analysis left to be addressed. Particularly, it is the the sequence part number 4, where the price action stands currently. And yeah, you guessed it, almighty fractals are helping us here again. Below you will find two charts (both are 30 min charts), which are actually zoomed in the price actions of the fourth step of the two fractals analyzed above. I can't stop enjoying and appreciating fractals and below you should really see why.  \n\n\n[GME price action 22-27 January](https://preview.redd.it/heozo1gg22n61.png?width=1646&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d637c1806d229ffad089dc6491357ce01b55207a)\n\n*Processing img m1dydccm22n61...*\n\nBecause they look similar again! Now I will ask you to excuse me, I started to work on this analysis about ten hours ago, and I really need to get some sleep, as my brain is holding strong to the last wrinkle it has left, so this explanation will be brief. I forecasted the apex point of the current 4 using not so complicated method, and again taking inspiration from the previous price action and its underlying patterns. The magenta curly lines play as supports for both of the impulses. And these look amazingly similar in its slope and pace, but we should probably stop being surprised about that at this point. The second important fractal factor is this chainsaw in the middle of the patterns, corresponding to the severe corrections in these bull runs. Remember being in the market at those moments? Wooh, that was fun. And finally, take a look at this averaged line that looks like a string of a bow - not only it averages the price action, it also completes this bow shaped fractal pattern, allowing us to predict the potential high of the current price action ($380-ish). That's it folks, mic drop.\n\nTL;DR: Fractals is life fractals is love  \u2764\ufe0f  as is GEEEMEEE",

Someone is on the LONG side buying up shares with retail.\n\nIn my opinion, after today, short interest could potentially even end up way higher than 40%. Look at the candles during those short ladder attacks. Shorts had to have borrow MILLIONS of shares to attempt to short ladder today. I wouldn't be surprised if this is Melvin &amp; CO's latest play to dig themselves out of their Gamestop loss porn either.\n\nMORE SHORTING = MORE SHORTS TO CHOKE\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo that's reason 1. There's a nonzero chance Jay Farner drops a bomb tomorrow that takes us to the stratosphere. But what's reason 2?\n\n\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8MY PRICE TARGET FOR RKT IS $73.5 \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\n\nLet's go through the numbers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRKT's projected EPS for this year is \\~ $2.45. \n\n\\[LINK 3\\] \\~ (SOURCE IS ON SA, REMOVED LINK BECAUSE IT WAS GETTING MY POST DELETED)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo get P/E, take the price and divide by earnings. Thus, we can use this to calculate the forward P/E for RKT. RKT closed at $41.79, which divided by $2.45 is \\~17.05. Thus, RKT currently trades at about a 17Forward P/E. Companies in this sector trade in between 15-30 P/E, and since I strongly believe RKT is a growth stock, I think it should trade at 30x P/E.\n\nThus, 30 x $2.45 is $73.5.\n\nTherefore, my PT for RKT is $73.5. RKT is a fintech company, and is a PROFITABLE one. Think about how many fintech companies have crazier valuations and aren't even profitable?\n\nYou know what that means?\n\nIT'S NOT FUCKING OVER. IF SUITS ARE BUYING AT ATH, IM BUYING AT ATH. IF SHORTS HAVE RELOADED, THE SQUEEZE HAS NOT SQUOZE. THE SUITS AGREE. RKT IS WORTH MORE THAN $40.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: SHORT INTEREST HAS PROBABLY GONE UP, SUITS ARE BUYING. CURRENT P/E is 17, GROWTH PE IN MY OPINION SHOULD BE AT LEAST 30. RKT IS STILL UNDERVALUED, AND MY PRICE TARGET IS $73.5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRemember, \ud83d\ude80 fundamentally a great company. They are still NOT priced as a growth stock. They are still NOT considered Fintech by the suits. There is a reason why this stock closed strong at a new ATH.\n\nI LIKE THE STOCK.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy PT is $73.5. NO \ud83e\uddfb\ud83d\udc50\n\nNot financial advice. I don't know anything.\n\nPositions: 150 shares, 50 $23 C 3/5 EXP. I will be exercising almost all my calls as I am LONG.\n\nI will be purchasing OTM calls tomorrow at open \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

HODL \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.**\n\nHang on to your bags, this puppy is going higher. The technicals all point BULLISH signals and signify GME is going much higher.\n\n**Case 1 : VOLUME**\n\nLook at the volume and price action for the last few weeks. Volume was actually decreasing from Feb 25 to Mar 3, and the price went UP, this is extremely bullish. Typically, if price stays flat or up on decreasing volume, this is bullish.\n\nSecondly, since Mar 3, we have seen increasing volume with higher prices. This is bullish.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Holy shit! ](https://preview.redd.it/40z53odskvl61.jpg?width=467&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28bacefabefab34d59ba5a2cf2a64b132afdc484)\n\n \n\n**Case 2 : MACD**\n\nMACD stands for Moving Average Convergence Divergence and essentially shows the relationship between two moving averages. The crossover occurred when Ryan Cohen tweeted his infamous McDonald's vanilla ice cream cone photo (coincidence?). MACD shows strong momentum and is pointing GME to higher prices.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Looks Bullish](https://preview.redd.it/s30997zukvl61.jpg?width=493&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e200ddb9c0a88284cce5c7c430806e4eff11222d)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n**Case 3 : AVAILABLE SHARES TO SHORT**\n\nFrom last Friday to today, the shares available to short have dropped a whopping 600,000 SHARES! Yet the price is up 35%+ today. This is extremely bullish, the shorts can't even drop the price given 600,000 shorted shares. Now keep in mind, this is counting the shares that are available to short, and does not include the millions of shares that are ALREADY shorted. If GME continues to climb higher, the short sellers may be margin called and forced to sell.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[600,000 shorted! ](https://preview.redd.it/9aaem6vxkvl61.png?width=498&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c2e0447f1c71e3c441110abad4bc6cb712b2627)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nThere are a lot more tailwinds that can catalyze GME. This analysis doesn't even consider the possibility of another gamma squeeze or how many shares are now becoming ITM or \"In The Money\". This will require Market Makers to purchase additional GME shares if they don't have it in possession on exercise.\n\nThis also doesn't consider the fundamental change in the company and how to properly revalue GameStop from a traditional brick and mortar to an e-commerce player.\n\nThe technicals signify bullishness and you should continue HODL.

        "selftext": "**TLDR** \\- the effect of short selling on a positive-beta stock will be to give the stock a negative beta. Otherwise, in normal situations, there cannot be a negative beta stock because it is only theoretically possible, not actually possible. What is GME's current beta? Depending on the source:\n\nFinancial Times: -1.7413\n\nYahoo Finance: -2.07\n\nNasdaq: -2.09\n\nAt 16 March 2021.\n\nThis is CRAZY. I am currently writing my dissertation for an MSc in Finance and Financial Law. I learned in Corporate Finance that a negative beta stock is like a mythical unicorn, so when I noticed a few weeks ago that GME's beta was -2.01, I interpreted this as some sort of perversion around what is happening with the stock right now but did not understand what it really meant. I have since been investigating this in my own time instead of my actual dissertation topic and this is what I have found - that short selling can create a negative beta - and now GME's beta has fallen even more to as much as -2.09 according to Nasdaq. That's almost -3!! Insane!!\n\n**Background theory - IMPORTANT**\n\nWhat is beta? Beta is a number that reflects the correlation between the price movement of a stock and the movement of the overall market. We do not have the data of the \"real world market\" so the \"market\" of GME is going to be the S&amp;P500. Basically the \"market\" is the universe in which we and all stocks exist. That is why a negative beta is normally not possible. It is like saying that a certain species of animal will thrive and prosper the more the health of the Earth as an environment deteriorates. Yeah, it could happen in an abnormal situation, like an atomic bomb and the cockroach population coming out the winner, but it is not something normal as we all depend for our growth on the market/the Earth.\n\nA beta of 0 means that there is no correlation between the market and the stock.\n\nA beta of 1 means that the stock moves exactly the same as the market, e.g. if market is up 10%, the stock is up 10%.\n\nA beta of more than 1 means that the stock amplifies the market's movement by that much, e.g. if market is up 10%, then a +1 beta stock would go up, e.g. 15%.\n\nA beta of -1 is a perfect negative correlation, so the stock moves exactly the opposite of the market, e.g. if market goes down 10%, the stock goes up 10%.\n\nA beta of less than -1 means this negative correlation is amplified, e.g. market goes down 10%, stock goes up 15%.\n\nAn easy online source:\n\n'Negative beta: A beta less than 0, which would indicate an inverse relation to the market, is possible but highly unlikely. Some investors argue that gold and gold stocks should have negative betas because they tend to do better when the stock market declines.'\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/investing/beta-gauging-price-fluctuations/](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/beta-gauging-price-fluctuations/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**About GME specifically**\n\nHere is the historical beta of GME from Zacks:\n\n02/28/2021\t-2.195\n\n12/31/2020\t1.404\n\n09/30/2020\t1.084\n\n06/30/2020\t1.038\n\n03/31/2020\t0.4512\n\nYou can see that GME's beta has only been negative since end of Feb 2021. Before that it had a very normal beta of over 1, meaning when the market was doing well, then its business did well too, i.e. people have money to spend on games, etc. Even during most of the lockdown its beta was still quite a bit above 1. But at the end of Feb, it suddenly went all the way down to -2.195. What happened at that time? The massive crash down to $38. Plotkin himself said that the rapid rise in price was not due to shorts covering right? But have they covered since one way or the other? The beta would indicate no because now the beta is even lower, at -2.09. Since Yahoo confirms Nasdaq, I think the FT is sus and in the best case just doesn't update its data. -1.7413 is still remarkable though.\n\nHere is a quote from an academic source by Fabozzi - the author whom I credit with helping me the most to prepare for my Corporate Finance exam - anything he writes is gold and written very clearly with no academic posturing or arrogance:\n\n'So far the implications of systematic risk have been ignored. The beta of a short position is the negative of the beta of a long position, and is hence normally a negative number. In the capital asset pricing model, the required rate of return for an investment depends on the correlation of the return from the investment with the other securities in the portfolio, a characteristic that can be measured by its beta.'\n\n[http://www.dmf.unisalento.it/\\~straf/allow\\_listing/fabio/fabio3.pdf](http://www.dmf.unisalento.it/~straf/allow_listing/fabio/fabio3.pdf)\n\nSee also this author:\n\n'Although the data used in this research consist of net short positions and the tax regulation in the Netherlands is different from USA regulation, a small negative beta is expected to account for end of the year, tax-motivated short selling.'\n\n[https://essay.utwente.nl/66633/1/Klamer\\_MA\\_MB.pdf](https://essay.utwente.nl/66633/1/Klamer_MA_MB.pdf)\n\nBoth authors mention this very casually and by the way because it is so obvious to them. Logically, if the true beta is, say, 1.4 then its beta when shorted must be a negative number. This is very significant for apes who like GME because they keep telling us that there is no more short interest, here's the data, etc. but they can't manipulate the beta. I don't know how the beta is calculated by these news outlets but I think it must be done automatically by the bots and even if FT were a shill and not simply inaccurate, the beta of -1.7413 is still crazy.\n\nFor comparison, this academic says:\n\n'Every time I have found a negative beta in practice, there was either a data error or the sample size was too small for the negative beta to be statistically significant...But now there is an interesting real life case of a negative beta stock: Zoom Video Communications, Inc....A better example of beta changing dramatically (going from around two to negative and then back to around two) within a few months without any change in the business mix of the company would be hard to find. ***Negative betas may be a once in a 100-year event \\[emphasis added\\]***.'\n\n[https://jrvarma.wordpress.com/2020/08/23/negative-beta-stocks-the-case-of-zoom/](https://jrvarma.wordpress.com/2020/08/23/negative-beta-stocks-the-case-of-zoom/)\n\nTo me, this is all very strong evidence that the shorts have not covered and are desperate. Due to the absence of reporting requirements for short positions and the other myriad and innovative ways that HFs may be shorting GME that we cannot see, no one has hard numbers for the actual short interest in GME, but ***the beta cannot lie***. Since HFs have been shorting GME since forever and the beta was still more than 1 even during the pandemic, it must have been safe for them ***so long as a large number of investors were not buying up GME and holding***. I am planning another post summarising what Fabozzi says about why, under realistic assumptions, optimists set the price, not pessimists (i.e. short sellers). \n\nSo long story short  \ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32 \n\nDisclaimer: not financial advice, etc. Please cross-post if you find this useful because my account is not old enough to post in r/GME. Thank you to everyone for the awards and upvotes on my FT post, it warmed this ape's heart. Tendies to all!",

        "selftext": "Ok look apes, I have been following the GME trends since before the first squeeze. Needless to say, much like the rest of you, I have spent hours upon hours looking at the trends, shorts, and data since the day of reckoning last month. \n\n**And with the jump last week there has been a lot of paper hand BS/ Misinformation being spread** (especially with RKT)\n\n**To simply put it,** in my opinion, **we are on the verge of something big**... \n\n**TL:DR at the bottom for the most atuist**\n\nHere is why my fellow tards,\n\n1) **We have proven the community strength**, A LOT I MEAN A LOT of us have held and held until we were finally seeing some **green** for the first time in weeks. I mean serious green, despite the quote on quote \"**Lackluster day**\" we are still up **162.5%** the past WEEK!\n\n2) **A stock with relatively little discussion on this page (RKT) is suddenly piking 50,60,70% increase???** Not to knock any fellow apes who invested (hopefully we will see a dump in GME soon after) but **it is so suspicious that a large movement into RKT aligns with the GME rise.** Don't take my word on this, but we have seen in the past other **\"GAMMA SQUEEZE\" for fill in the blank as soon as GME has spiked, and what happens after? They fall and fall hard.** \n\n3) The HF are scared, bad. With news breaking about Melvin and Citadale breaking over the past week, we know **that they have lost billions.** Not only that , they have continued to short the stock with heavy volume. Now with naked shorting, no one knows what the present of the float is exactly, but the estimate remains high. \n\nSOURCE: Wall Street Journal, 5 days ago. \n\n*Processing img v59kaj2xapk61...*\n\n**Now why you might ask losing roughly 50% of your entire capital important? If you are an autist, and I know you are, let me explain.** I mentioned this in my last post, but essential without capital, **how can HF run effective short latter attacks as we saw after the enormous initial spike? They can't- or at least we hope- with what we have seen over the past few days, GME has not seen any significant short latter attacks, heck we have gone up $20 alone this week!!! (EVEN WITH THE MARKET SHITTING ITS PANTS)** \n\n4) **With contracts being exercised last week at around $55 dollars, we saw a gamma squeeze occur.** Now I have seen 5+ people on here explain wildly differing theories ranging from, if we hit 130 it will trigger the next squeeze, or on 3/15 the squeeze will happen! Now we can all take this with a grain of salt, after all, we are apes. **But what we can do is hold and continue to break resistance, yesterday was $113, today it was $120.** In my opinion, if we continue to rise steadily we can trigger another ITM call and see another squeeze. \n\n[F ROBINHOOD](https://preview.redd.it/w55we4o6dpk61.png?width=933&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e211a49e42220b19f3998f6c764a4dbd428c5bb0)\n\n5) **I know that to your paper hands this will kill you, but if the squeeze never happens GME is a great long-term hold. Here is why:** \n\n\\-They have landed a **huge** multi-year deal with micro soft.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7dvfklepdpk61.png?width=993&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5b6fb6667ffa99e41bb73b473f9ecb0f25e8f9d\n\n\\-**They fired their insanely incompetent CFO Jim Bell,** seriously look him up dude was a douche.\n\nthis shows seriously **promising financial redevelopment for GME.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[STILL F ROBINHOOD](https://preview.redd.it/q5m4zzdjepk61.png?width=939&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44bddf0d683a160630575ae539c13438fff57204)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-**New wave of modernization in the gaming world. As a gamer myself, not to brag, I would love to see GME rise and take over as the ultimate streaming platform, and with the new push for the future and deals that just landed, I think that there is a pretty good chance this will happen.** \n\n**TL:DR- IMO I think we have this. There is clear panic on the HF sides, we are up $20 from Monday with a shit ass entire market, there have been no outstanding short latter attacks, HF is down billions with high interest, there is a flood for a \"NEW SQUEEZE RKT\" (DISTRACTION), we have been stable and we are holding. IMO if we break resistance at 130, there will be some serious momentum.**   \n\n\n**IN SORT HOLD THE MF LINES RETARDS- I am not an advisor we just like the stock.**",

        "selftext": "Get your tinfoil hat out \ud83e\udd8d, its time to see what you think you want to see but don't really want to. This is perfect for any newbie or Silverback trying to understand what is going on and how GME has ended up the way it has.\n\nTl;Dr at end.\n\nThere are many great DD's that clearly explain Naked Shorting in 3-4 sentences that we can all agree are great. **However while looking around for DTCC ownership** and after having found [The Oil Drum](http://theoildrum.com/special/archives) (a great archive of oil related information/discussion btw), **Cede and co** which was brought to my attention a month ago. I dismissed it as a conspiracy theory until I saw the post a couple days ago **(credit:** u/bEAc0n) bringing them up again and I took it seriously for once, which then led me to try and find a website like The Oil Drum but for Shorting.\n\nThis website is run by a **dude called Larry with 40 years of WS experience, ex-Goldman Sachs EVP, Board Member, Director of Equities+Income** and so on, he clearly brings up and explains the implications of everything to do with Naked Shorting and how it plays out in the market. You can look around his website but all he really talks about other than the Shorting is Pharmaceuticals/Bio-tech.\n\nI sent him an email and this was his response\n\n&gt;Thanks for the kind words.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;No problem with your request. Here is the link you should give them.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[https://smithonstocks.com/?s=illegal+naked+shorting](https://smithonstocks.com/?s=illegal+naked+shorting) (This is Part 10)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If there is any movement formed to take on illegal naked shorting, I would be happy to contribute. I have been consistently frustrated in trying to get media or politicians interested.\n\n**Read part 8 if you want to hear about CEDE and how once a counterfeit share is created it is forever viewed as a legitimate share unless if the company bring all shares back into itself to verify them (basically once counterfeited it exists forever, as a shareholder meet only verifies the shares owned by the ppl who will vote iirc)**\n\n[**Part 1**](https://smithonstocks.com/part-1-in-a-series-of-reports-on-blatant-widespread-stock-manipulation-that-is-enabled-by-illegal-naked-shorting/)**,** [**Part 2**](https://smithonstocks.com/part-2-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-conventional-wisdom-on-how-illegal-short-sales-are-executed/)**,** [**Part 3**](https://smithonstocks.com/part-3-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-prime-brokers-and-the-dtcc-have-a-troubling-monopoly-on-clearing-and-settling-stock-trades/)**,** [**Part 4**](https://smithonstocks.com/part-4-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-who-are-the-key-players/)**,** [**Part 5**](https://smithonstocks.com/part-5-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-traditional-shorting-compared-to-naked-shorting-both-legal-and-illegal/)**,** [**Part 6**](https://smithonstocks.com/part-6-illegal-naked-shorting-the-secs-regulation-sho-is-intended-to-prevent-illegal-naked-shorting-but-is-ineffective/)**,** [**Part 7**](https://smithonstocks.com/part-7-illegal-naked-shorting-dtcc-continuous-net-settlement-and-stock-borrowing-programs-have-loopholes-that-facilitate-illegal-naked-shorting/)**,** [**Part 8**](https://smithonstocks.com/part-8-illegal-naked-shorting-series-who-or-what-is-cede-and-what-role-does-cede-play-in-the-trading-of-stocks/)**,** [**Part 9**](https://smithonstocks.com/part-10-of-illegal-naked-shorting-series-the-risk-reward-of-shorting-versus-buying-stocks-is-extremely-unfavorable/)**,** [**Part 10**](https://smithonstocks.com/part-10-of-illegal-naked-shorting-series-legal-shorting-of-stocks-is-a-losers-game-but-illegal-naked-shorting-transforms-it-into-a-winners-game/)\n\nThis is the important part: a quote from Part 8 if you dont want to read the whole series\n\n&gt;**While you may think you are buying registered stock, you are actually buying a financial derivative related to that stock.** **Effectively, you are buying a financial derivative from brokers of a financial derivative they hold from Cede that is just a digital entry in your DTC account.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Cede is at the center of the current, paperless electronic trading system that enables lightning fast trading of large blocks of stock by institutional investors and computers. Unfortunately, the intention\u00a0 in designing it was to provide liquidity and reduce settlement risk. There is virtually no transparency in the system. Disturbingly, there are loopholes which allow for the counterfeiting of shares by market makers on a massive scale through illegal naked shorting and other measures. **At present, there is no way for an outsider or even the securities industry\u2019s regulator, the SEC, to meaningfully detect and track these counterfeit shares. Once created counterfeit shares go on to be treated the same as legitimate street name shares**\n\n**TL;DR: until the people at the top (aka CEDE and co) are brought into court/subpoenad we will never ever have a truly free financial system, they control everything and it is up to them to decide how and where the stock market goes. Their company valuation is somewhere in the region of $34T as of 2019 IIRC yet it is a private firm??? This means some very big people and organisations are playing a very big game that we are not a part of.**",

        "selftext": "EDIT: Based on the fact that a number of comments seem to have been made without reading beyond the first 9 words of the title, and the fact that this is sitting at 60% upvoted, I'd encourage you to at least read to the TLDR.\n\nI usually stick to providing raw data, but this post has a little bit of added analysis. I don\u2019t own $GME or $RKT (I don't actively invest to avoid accusations of bias in my data) and don\u2019t like either stock over the other. I do like WSB though and don\u2019t like baseless conspiracy theories, and I have seen a lot of conspiracy theories flying around WSB recently without much evidence to accompany them. Most recently, I got flooded by comments like this on my data post yesterday.\n\n[Comments](https://preview.redd.it/baa7ritypuk61.png?width=1432&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6b8eab6ff5519aac82a87a06e742d52aa74440e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe goal of this post was to look at one of those theories and see if I can provide a base for it. The theory in question is \u201c$RKT discussion is being artificially pushed to distract from $GME\u201d. A TLDR of my analysis is:\n\n**A) Both $RKT and $GME are being discussed by a lot of accounts that are new to posting on WSB.**\n\n**B) Accounts discussing $GME are actually newer to WSB on average than accounts discussing $RKT**\n\n**C) There are a small, but non-zero, number of people trying to artificially manipulate discussion to get others to sell $GME. However, this is done with no relation to $RKT.**\n\n**D) Accounts mentioning $GME and $RKT behave similarly in promoting the respective stocks.**\n\nThrough my analysis I wasn\u2019t able to find any solid evidence of $RKT being artificially pushed as a distraction from $GME. While it\u2019s easy to complain about u/zjz's iron-fisted bot army, I think it deserves a lot of credit for curbing attempts at manipulation.\n\nNow I will provide the data backing up these conclusions, and call out one account I did find attempting to artificially manipulate discussion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Both $RKT and $GME are being discussed by a lot of accounts that are new to posting on WSB. Accounts discussing $GME are actually newer to WSB on average than accounts discussing $RKT.**\n\nI don\u2019t think I need to patronize you with a bunch of facts and figures showing how much attention has been drawn to wsb recently. Obviously this attention came with a lot of new posters, and that\u2019s fully on display when we look at when accounts talking about $GME and $RKT first joined the wsb community. The motive behind looking at these numbers was to determine whether there were a bunch of new accounts who joined the community with the sole purpose of distracting from $GME.\n\nThe average $RKT poster first posted on wsb on December 10th, 2020. This is pretty shockingly young, but the average $GME poster is even newer to the community with an average date of December 22nd, 2020.\n\nHere are histograms showing when the accounts mentioning both stocks first joined the community, by year:\n\n[RKT Histogram](https://preview.redd.it/qp652yp7quk61.png?width=1726&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cc3b954aea59a00e2a3f0e570b825e614c0cec0)\n\n[GME Histogram](https://preview.redd.it/d79kdzu8quk61.png?width=1726&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95408f675b12f97cbd9231e71fa96aac0c43b1d8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**There is a non-zero number of people trying to manipulate discussion to get others to sell $GME, but not enough to have a significant effect.**\n\nOne other thing I examined was how much different accounts were shilling $GME and $RKT. For the most part, there wasn\u2019t too much spam of either ticker by individual accounts with a few notable exceptions. Below are scatter plots showing accounts with the date they joined WSB on the x-axis and the number of times they have mentioned $GME/$RKT in the last 5 days on the y-axis.\n\n[$GME date joined vs. mentions](https://preview.redd.it/g9vgmq6gquk61.png?width=1852&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73571b1836771fc0c8fa3c80eebd738d13bd5d9b)\n\n[$RKT date joined vs. mentions](https://preview.redd.it/0a8xwqlkquk61.png?width=1752&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7e79bb797abbdf49eb43b4c7fd94c4541c6d58b)\n\nThere are 3 prominent outliers that I will examine, one of which I think probably deserves some sort of moderator action. On the $GME graph we have /u/char1101g way out in the upper right. He just started posting on here yesterday, and has been just absolutely spamming anti-GME shit since. Although posts like \"SELL YOU GME STOCK\" seem to match the grammar and speech patterns expected of a short-only investor, I don't really see this single example as solid evidence of a larger artificial anti-GME push.\n\nOn the $RKT side of things we have two accounts that are pretty clearly tied to real people, so I don\u2019t want to call them out by username. While I\u2019d say they\u2019re pretty clearly innocent of being hedge fund accounts (old accounts, lots of personal info, lots of non-wsb posts), they\u2019re absolutely guilty of living in the discussion threads, with dozens of comments already today. You could probably make an argument that someone commenting about $RKT all day long is having some impact on the overall discussion, but given that it\u2019s just two random dudes I kind of doubt it has much of an effect in the grand scheme of things.\n\n**Accounts mentioning $GME and $RKT behave similarly in promoting the respective stocks.**\n\nThe last thing I wanted to look at was how accounts behaved in promoting $GME and $RKT. In particular, I wanted to see if accounts mentioning either stock were more likely to mention it repeatedly. I ended up not finding much of a significant difference. Below is a table where $GME/$RKT accounts are defined as accounts mentioning each respective stock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Mentions of $RKT/$GME over last 5 days|$RKT accounts|$GME accounts|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|\\&gt;1|.806|.801|\n|\\&gt;2|.653|.657|\n|\\&gt;5|.454|.433|\n|\\&gt;10|.331|.310|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's a pretty small overlap (34%) between people talking about $GME and people talking about $RKT, likely leading to some of the conflict that we have seen, but from my research I wasn't able to find any solid evidence of $RKT being artificially pushed as a distraction from $GME.  That being said, I'm happy to hear criticisms on my work, let me know below if you have any thoughts.",
