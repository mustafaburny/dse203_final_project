In the same way that a transition to 4G opened up space for the emergence of smartphones, mobile commerce, and mobile banking, the introduction of 5G network is expected to usher the next wave of technological advancements.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**QCOM: Qualcomm**\n\nQualcomm has an agreement with Apple to produce 5G chips for the iPhone-maker until at least 2023. Apple is expected to rollout its new 5G-enabled smartphone later this year, which should also include Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X55 5G chip.\u00a0\n\nTherefore, supplying Apple \u2013 which sold 72.9 million iPhones in the fourth quarter last year \u2013 with 5G chips should enable Qualcomm with enough revenue to continue investing in the 5G network.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MRVL: Marvell**\n\nMarvell has been on a roll recently, striking a contract with Samsung to provide chips to power LTE and 5G base stations. Moreover, the California-based company was chosen by Nokia to help the Finnish telecom giant to solve its 5G chip problems.\n\nShares of Marvell are trading around 10% off the 2020 highs, with technicals aligning for a potential move to $32 later this year, a 24.5% premium on the current market price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TXN: Texas Instruments**\n\nAs a major player in the semiconductor industry, Texas Instruments is another company expected to benefit from an uptick in demand for chips it produces.\u00a0\n\nTexas Instruments reported stronger-than-expected financial results for the first quarter, with revenues for the second quarter seen in the region of $3 billion.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SWKS: Skyworks**\n\nSkyworks is one of the most prominent suppliers for Apple with nearly 50% of annual revenues coming from the iPhone producer.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI think the technologies that we\u2019re working on in our ecosystem with partners like Verizon and infrastructure players and even the Chinese, we\u2019re all coming together to make this work, but it\u2019s a real indication of how necessary these applications are to the economy,\u201d said Skyworks Solutions CEO Liam Griffin.\n\nThe tech giant also produces turnkey engines that are seen as a critical element of the wireless infrastructure.\n\nAfter a deep pullback in March, shares of Skyworks have since rebounded nearly 50%, trading above the $100 mark once again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My thoughts**\n\nQCOM for me seems like the safest bet. Texas Instruments looks really interesting as well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Which do you fancy?**",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 4th, 2020.\n\n# **April\u2019s jobs report showing millions out of work looms large in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/01/aprils-jobs-report-showing-millions-out-of-work-looms-large-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Investors will focus on the slow reopening of the economy in the coming week, as Friday\u2019s dismal April employment report is expect to paint a frightening picture of the most rapid job losses in history.\n*****\n&gt; The unemployment rate is expected to jump from 4.4% to over 16.1% in April, the highest level since 1939, according to Dow Jones. Job losses are estimated to total 22 million, slightly below the entire number of jobs that were recovered since the Great Recession.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said the market will likely be able to look past the terrible jobs number as it has done with most bad data, showing the results of a sudden and unprecedented shutdown of the economy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think people are too gloomy about the unemployment situation. I think they think the unemployment rate is going to rise through the summer,\u201d said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont. \u201cI think the unemployment rate probably peaks in May.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Earnings season continues with dozens more companies reporting first-quarter results and talking about the impact of the virus and shutdowns on their businesses. So far, earnings appear to be down 12.7% in the first quarter, based on actual reports and estimates, according to Refinitiv. A diverse group of companies report, including Walt Disney, General Motors, CVS Health and Bristol-Myers Squibb.\n*****\n&gt; But investors are watching the restarting of the economy, now underway at some level in many states. \u201cIf they go well that\u2019s a good thing, but if in a week or two, you start to see some bad virus numbers, that\u2019ll be a blow to confidence,\u201d said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo.\n*****\n&gt; # Best April in years\nStocks started May with a sharp decline Friday, after a 12.7% gain in the S&amp;P 500 in April, its best month since 1987.\n*****\n&gt; Sam Stovall, CFRA chief investment strategist, said the market had been looking forward to the latest extension of fiscal stimulus, approved by Congress, and comments from the Fed, which reaffirmed after its meeting Wednesday that it will do whatever is needed to help the economy. \u201cNow there\u2019s not that much to look forward to,\u201d he said, adding the market would react negatively to any resurgence in the coronavirus outbreak.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe had a very nice April, the best April since 1938. May is sort of a ho-hum month,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cIt\u2019s in the bottom half in terms of average price change, slightly below average in terms of frequency of an advance. \u2026 Just looking at last year, May tends to digest April\u2019s gains.\u201d The S&amp;P 500\u2032s April gain was its best for the month in 82 years.\n*****\n&gt; # Virus economy\nEconomists and market strategists have been tracking the progress of the virus state by state, watching hospitalization rates, new cases and recoveries for clues on how quickly the economy might be able to restart. The economy is expected to have plunged into a deep recession in the second quarter, contracting by 35% or more, after a 4.8% decline in the first quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Stanley said he expects the unemployment rate to be a better-than-consensus 11.6% in April before it rises again in May. \u201cThis is all a stab in the dark,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s not going to come down as quickly as it went up,\u201d said Stanley. \u201cBut I do think you\u2019re going to see steady improvement. I think you\u2019re going to see millions of people brought back into the payrolls for several months in succession. I think we can get out of the double digits [unemployment] by the end of the summer.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Some workers are expected to return to their company payrolls as a result of the small business-focused Paycheck Protection Program, which encourages companies to keep workers on their payroll and bring back those who were cut. But that may not show up until May or June as a factor in the jobs data, Stanley said.\n*****\n&gt; Millions more are expected to have filed for unemployment claims in the week ending May 2, on top of the 30 million who filed in the previous six weeks. Economists say with such big unprecedented numbers, it is difficult to predict the unemployment rate since some people may have been temporarily unemployed and expect to return to work.\n*****\n&gt; But regardless, the number could be a shocker even though the market has shrugged off the big numbers of jobless claims and focused instead on the virus curve flattening.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it could spook people,\u201d said Schumacher. \u201cIn the markets, we\u2019ve been watching the weekly claims, but everybody knows what unemployment is.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stanley said he is also watching Tuesday\u2019s ISM nonmanufacturing data, a look at the services sector during April. A cross section of March data shows it was the services sector that took the biggest hit in the shutdowns, and it\u2019s unclear how quickly it can recover.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere are people who will go and do things as soon as they\u2019re allowed to, and there are people who are going to stay home for a month or two longer,\u201d he said. \u201cI do think expecting we\u2019re going to pack 100,000 people into a football stadium in September is way too optimistic.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stanley said some of the steep drop in consumer spending in March was the result of consumers stopping spending on health care, including elective surgery. That actually is an area that can bounce back quickly once the health care system is up and running for non virus related treatments.\n*****\n&gt; # A new 20-year bond\nThe Treasury could announce its new 20-year bond on Wednesday, when it discloses its quarterly refunding requirements, Schumacher said. He expects about $21 billion of the new 20-year to be issued in the second quarter.\n*****\n&gt; The amount of Treasury debt is expected to grow in the second quarter to help fund the growing deficit, made bigger by the trillions the government is spending to combat the virus.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe supply announcement we think is significant because you\u2019re going to see large auction increases, not just for one month but set in motion for many months to come,\u201d said Schumacher. He expects Treasury to announce $330 billion in notes and bonds in the refunding for the second quarter, up from $240 billion in the first quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury bill issuance is expected at $1.9 trillion in the second quarter but Schumacher expects that to fall to $260 billion in the third quarter. The bills were used to give the Treasury cash to pay for emergency programs and more of that debt will move to long term debt.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/lucZqhO.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ScMf5ki.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/lTrieA0.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/a6RSgrj.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9mfZglW.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Rkt7Uup.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8Ru9JJy.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1L1YEEG.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DwM4sys.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OxcbRYQ.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/zvZWYtm.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/93bme56.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/b57XIzN.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# US Manufacturing Sector Has Entered a Deep Recession\n\n&gt; It is a foregone conclusion that the US economy has entered recession, led by the consumer, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the US economy based on gross domestic product (GDP). The collapse of consumer spending was evident in March personal consumption expenditures data released on Wednesday that showed a record 7.5% month-over-month drop in consumer outlays. It would have been worse if we weren\u2019t stocking our refrigerators and pantries.\n\n&gt; The manufacturing sector is also contracting sharply, not surprisingly given the business shutdowns that began in March. Investors had a glimpse of the extent of the hit to manufacturing in the business investment component of first quarter GDP, which revealed a sharp 8.6% annualized decline, durable goods orders for March, which fell 14.4%, and Markit\u2019s preliminary Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) for manufacturing in April that came in at 36.9, a level consistent with a severe recession.\n\n&gt; Today\u2019s Institute for Supply Management (ISM) PMI for manufacturing\u2014the so-called official PMI\u2014provided more evidence of the depth of the manufacturing downturn. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the headline index fell 7.6 points to 41.5, better than Bloomberg\u2019s consensus forecast of 36, but a level consistent with prior recessions.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ISM-Chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; But that\u2019s the good news. Peeling back the onion in this report reveals that the headline number was inflated by the supplier deliveries component. Normally, lengthening supplier delivery times reflect strong demand, which prevents suppliers from keeping up. However, in this environment, it reflects supply chain disruptions from lockdowns around the world related to COVID-19.\n\n&gt; The new orders and employment components of the report, which both fell more than 15 points to around 27, are better indicators of where manufacturing activity in the US is right now. The new orders number just missed the December 2008 level of 25.9, while the employment component hit its lowest level since 1949, putting the slump into proper perspective.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe more forward-looking components of the ISM report clearly indicate the manufacturing sector is in the midst of one of the sharpest contractions ever,\u201d said LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. \u201cGiven the close relationship between manufacturing activity and corporate profits, the 25% cut to S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates for 2020 that we\u2019ve seen since March 1 is probably not enough.\u201d\n\n&gt; The ISM report points to a sharp upcoming drop in capital investment and a huge hit to earnings in the second quarter\u2014potentially down 40% year over year (FactSet consensus is calling for a 38% year-over-year decline in S&amp;P 500 earnings).\n\n&gt; Looking ahead, while the economic impact of the global lockdowns has been severe, we continue to be reassured by developing plans to reopen the economy, progress toward treatments and vaccines, and the resolve of Americans to get through this. We continue to expect a very strong rebound in manufacturing and the broad economy later this year.\n\n*****\n\n# Global Central Banks All In\n\n&gt; The Federal Reserve (Fed), the European Central Bank (ECB), and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) all met in the last week and while the show of power was minimal compared to recent weeks, they collectively reasserted their resolve to do whatever is necessary to support the global economy through the COVID-19 economic crisis. Rates are being held about as low as they can go, significant new programs to enhance market liquidity and support lending are in place, and, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, asset purchases have accelerated. In fact, with April not yet completed, central bank assets have risen over $3 trillion, the biggest two-month jump on record.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe central bank response to COVID-19 has been fast, effective, and built to impress,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAnd the market is seeing it. It\u2019s no coincidence that the market bottomed the day after the Fed rolled out a wide range of new programs addressing key areas of market and economic disruption.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Blog-Chart-20-04-30.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Overview of Recent Central Bank Activity\n\n&gt; The Fed concluded its most recent two-day meeting on Wednesday, April 29. Prior to the meeting the Fed had expanded its program supporting municipalities by lowering the minimum size of the city or county to qualify. The Fed left its target rate unchanged at 0 \u2013 0.25%. Through its policy statement and Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s comments, the Fed signaled that it is unlikely to remove its extraordinary policy support anytime soon, and we believe the Fed may hold its policy rate near zero into 2022. Asset purchases are currently open-ended and have expanded to include investment-grade and high-yield corporate exchange-traded funds.\n\n&gt; The BOJ met on Monday, April 27 and announced that it would lift its cap on buying government bonds, making purchases open ended, and triple the size of its corporate bond commercial debt purchases.\n\n&gt; The ECB met on Thursday, April 30 and announced new refinancing operations and that it would ease conditions on long-term loans to banks, encouraging banks to increase lending.\n\n&gt; With interest rates near zero, all major central banks have been expanding their economic support through new programs and increased asset purchases. Central bank are showing that in a time of crisis, their policy response is not limited to setting policy rates or even bond purchases. The expanded activity has all but eliminated the idea that the central banks are out of ammunition, both now and looking forward. There will come a time when these programs will end, balance sheets will unwind, and rates will rise. But until that time, central banks have shown that even prudent support in a time of economic distress is only limited by their imagination, keeping the old investing maxim \u201cDon\u2019t fight the Fed\u201d alive even in an age of zero rates.\n\n*****\n\n# Typical May Trading: A Month of Transition with Negative Predisposition\n\n&gt; Once again it is that time of the year where we increasingly see and hear \u201cSell in May.\u201d But when exactly in May is the \u201cbest\u201d time to sell? Based upon the last 21 years of data, the best time could be early in May. The month has opened well, on average, recently with strength on the first trading day and on the second trading day for the most part. Afterwards, DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 all tend to drift sideways to lower until around May\u2019s sixteenth trading day or so. It is on this day the NASDAQ and Russell 2000 begin to rally to finish the month. Beware though, this late-May rally typically fizzles before it can exceed the highs reached earlier in the month.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1df0a9e6bf9c57baf44e6917725a0b23/49574a3950141284-4d/s500x750/4f224d3ee89c6ef6d69c08facbac61a77da3fd3b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# This is Still an Election Year\n\n&gt; We have all been rather preoccupied with the coronavirus pandemic, market volatility and our individual situation. Meanwhile there is still a U.S. Presidential Election taking place this year. And folks are beginning to wonder what the next political alignment might be and the ramifications that alignment has had on the market historically.\n\n&gt; Six possible political alignments exist in Washington: Republican President with a Republican congress, Democratic congress or split Congress; and a Democratic President with a Democratic Congress, Republican Congress or split Congress. Data presented in the chart below begin in 1949 with the first full presidential term following WWII.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dce5f19dd2ccfc16a4e0795dd5a11f68/8033867962439c40-45/s500x750/8543ffd66d568035ffa681a3d72b861c8f84b996.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Election years are traditionally up years. Incumbent administrations shamelessly attempt to massage the economy so voters will keep them in power. But sometimes overpowering events occur and the market crumbles, usually resulting in a change of political control.\n\n&gt; Republicans won in 1920 (DJIA -32.9%) as the post-war economy contracted and President Wilson ailed. The Democrats came back during the 1932 (-23.1%) Depression when the Dow hit its lowest level of the 20th century. A world at war and the fall of France jolted the market in 1940 (-12.7%), but Roosevelt won an unprecedented third term. Cold War confrontations and Truman\u2019s historic upset of Dewey held markets down through the end of 1948 (-2.1%). Recently the Great Recession and bear market of 2008 (-33.8%) helped put Obama and the Democrats back in the White House.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fe57b47990e4b1b913e16595818a4df4/8033867962439c40-ea/s500x750/b5004568a1ca04f9004d23bd405de22f277408f2.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# 10-Day Advance/Decline Lines Running Hot\n\n&gt; The gains in the first half of the week lifted every sector but two\u2014Utilities and Financials\u2014above their 50-DMAs. Meanwhile, Health Care had even touched overbought territory (over 1 standard deviation above its 50-day) earlier in the week, making it the first sector to be overbought since late February.\n\n&gt; When it comes to another measure we monitor, the 10-day advance/decline line, conditions are more broadly appearing overbought. The 10-day advance/decline line measures the average number of daily advancers minus decliners in an index or sector over the last 10 trading days. Very high readings suggest that things have gotten extended in the very near term and downside mean reversion can be expected. Very low reading suggest the opposite.\n\n&gt; The 10-day A/D lines for sectors have been pretty strong recently indicating broad participation in the rally, but this has led these readings to become elevated indicating conditions may be running a bit too hot in the near term. Outside of the defensive sectors like Consumer Staples, Utilities, and Real Estate, every sector's 10-day A/D line has been in overbought territory at some point over the past week. The same can also be said for the 10-day A/D line for the S&amp;P 500. We'd note, though, that while A/D lines are extended, they're not at extreme levels seen at other points over the past year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/10day.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending May 1st, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWpVmNiVbw4))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 5.3.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 4th, 2020.\n\n# **April\u2019s jobs report showing millions out of work looms large in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/01/aprils-jobs-report-showing-millions-out-of-work-looms-large-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Investors will focus on the slow reopening of the economy in the coming week, as Friday\u2019s dismal April employment report is expect to paint a frightening picture of the most rapid job losses in history.\n*****\n&gt; The unemployment rate is expected to jump from 4.4% to over 16.1% in April, the highest level since 1939, according to Dow Jones. Job losses are estimated to total 22 million, slightly below the entire number of jobs that were recovered since the Great Recession.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said the market will likely be able to look past the terrible jobs number as it has done with most bad data, showing the results of a sudden and unprecedented shutdown of the economy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think people are too gloomy about the unemployment situation. I think they think the unemployment rate is going to rise through the summer,\u201d said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont. \u201cI think the unemployment rate probably peaks in May.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Earnings season continues with dozens more companies reporting first-quarter results and talking about the impact of the virus and shutdowns on their businesses. So far, earnings appear to be down 12.7% in the first quarter, based on actual reports and estimates, according to Refinitiv. A diverse group of companies report, including Walt Disney, General Motors, CVS Health and Bristol-Myers Squibb.\n*****\n&gt; But investors are watching the restarting of the economy, now underway at some level in many states. \u201cIf they go well that\u2019s a good thing, but if in a week or two, you start to see some bad virus numbers, that\u2019ll be a blow to confidence,\u201d said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo.\n*****\n&gt; # Best April in years\nStocks started May with a sharp decline Friday, after a 12.7% gain in the S&amp;P 500 in April, its best month since 1987.\n*****\n&gt; Sam Stovall, CFRA chief investment strategist, said the market had been looking forward to the latest extension of fiscal stimulus, approved by Congress, and comments from the Fed, which reaffirmed after its meeting Wednesday that it will do whatever is needed to help the economy. \u201cNow there\u2019s not that much to look forward to,\u201d he said, adding the market would react negatively to any resurgence in the coronavirus outbreak.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe had a very nice April, the best April since 1938. May is sort of a ho-hum month,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cIt\u2019s in the bottom half in terms of average price change, slightly below average in terms of frequency of an advance. \u2026 Just looking at last year, May tends to digest April\u2019s gains.\u201d The S&amp;P 500\u2032s April gain was its best for the month in 82 years.\n*****\n&gt; # Virus economy\nEconomists and market strategists have been tracking the progress of the virus state by state, watching hospitalization rates, new cases and recoveries for clues on how quickly the economy might be able to restart. The economy is expected to have plunged into a deep recession in the second quarter, contracting by 35% or more, after a 4.8% decline in the first quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Stanley said he expects the unemployment rate to be a better-than-consensus 11.6% in April before it rises again in May. \u201cThis is all a stab in the dark,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s not going to come down as quickly as it went up,\u201d said Stanley. \u201cBut I do think you\u2019re going to see steady improvement. I think you\u2019re going to see millions of people brought back into the payrolls for several months in succession. I think we can get out of the double digits [unemployment] by the end of the summer.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Some workers are expected to return to their company payrolls as a result of the small business-focused Paycheck Protection Program, which encourages companies to keep workers on their payroll and bring back those who were cut. But that may not show up until May or June as a factor in the jobs data, Stanley said.\n*****\n&gt; Millions more are expected to have filed for unemployment claims in the week ending May 2, on top of the 30 million who filed in the previous six weeks. Economists say with such big unprecedented numbers, it is difficult to predict the unemployment rate since some people may have been temporarily unemployed and expect to return to work.\n*****\n&gt; But regardless, the number could be a shocker even though the market has shrugged off the big numbers of jobless claims and focused instead on the virus curve flattening.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it could spook people,\u201d said Schumacher. \u201cIn the markets, we\u2019ve been watching the weekly claims, but everybody knows what unemployment is.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stanley said he is also watching Tuesday\u2019s ISM nonmanufacturing data, a look at the services sector during April. A cross section of March data shows it was the services sector that took the biggest hit in the shutdowns, and it\u2019s unclear how quickly it can recover.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere are people who will go and do things as soon as they\u2019re allowed to, and there are people who are going to stay home for a month or two longer,\u201d he said. \u201cI do think expecting we\u2019re going to pack 100,000 people into a football stadium in September is way too optimistic.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stanley said some of the steep drop in consumer spending in March was the result of consumers stopping spending on health care, including elective surgery. That actually is an area that can bounce back quickly once the health care system is up and running for non virus related treatments.\n*****\n&gt; # A new 20-year bond\nThe Treasury could announce its new 20-year bond on Wednesday, when it discloses its quarterly refunding requirements, Schumacher said. He expects about $21 billion of the new 20-year to be issued in the second quarter.\n*****\n&gt; The amount of Treasury debt is expected to grow in the second quarter to help fund the growing deficit, made bigger by the trillions the government is spending to combat the virus.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe supply announcement we think is significant because you\u2019re going to see large auction increases, not just for one month but set in motion for many months to come,\u201d said Schumacher. He expects Treasury to announce $330 billion in notes and bonds in the refunding for the second quarter, up from $240 billion in the first quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury bill issuance is expected at $1.9 trillion in the second quarter but Schumacher expects that to fall to $260 billion in the third quarter. The bills were used to give the Treasury cash to pay for emergency programs and more of that debt will move to long term debt.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/lucZqhO.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ScMf5ki.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/lTrieA0.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/a6RSgrj.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9mfZglW.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Rkt7Uup.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8Ru9JJy.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1L1YEEG.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DwM4sys.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OxcbRYQ.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/zvZWYtm.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/93bme56.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/b57XIzN.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# US Manufacturing Sector Has Entered a Deep Recession\n\n&gt; It is a foregone conclusion that the US economy has entered recession, led by the consumer, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the US economy based on gross domestic product (GDP). The collapse of consumer spending was evident in March personal consumption expenditures data released on Wednesday that showed a record 7.5% month-over-month drop in consumer outlays. It would have been worse if we weren\u2019t stocking our refrigerators and pantries.\n\n&gt; The manufacturing sector is also contracting sharply, not surprisingly given the business shutdowns that began in March. Investors had a glimpse of the extent of the hit to manufacturing in the business investment component of first quarter GDP, which revealed a sharp 8.6% annualized decline, durable goods orders for March, which fell 14.4%, and Markit\u2019s preliminary Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) for manufacturing in April that came in at 36.9, a level consistent with a severe recession.\n\n&gt; Today\u2019s Institute for Supply Management (ISM) PMI for manufacturing\u2014the so-called official PMI\u2014provided more evidence of the depth of the manufacturing downturn. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the headline index fell 7.6 points to 41.5, better than Bloomberg\u2019s consensus forecast of 36, but a level consistent with prior recessions.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ISM-Chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; But that\u2019s the good news. Peeling back the onion in this report reveals that the headline number was inflated by the supplier deliveries component. Normally, lengthening supplier delivery times reflect strong demand, which prevents suppliers from keeping up. However, in this environment, it reflects supply chain disruptions from lockdowns around the world related to COVID-19.\n\n&gt; The new orders and employment components of the report, which both fell more than 15 points to around 27, are better indicators of where manufacturing activity in the US is right now. The new orders number just missed the December 2008 level of 25.9, while the employment component hit its lowest level since 1949, putting the slump into proper perspective.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe more forward-looking components of the ISM report clearly indicate the manufacturing sector is in the midst of one of the sharpest contractions ever,\u201d said LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. \u201cGiven the close relationship between manufacturing activity and corporate profits, the 25% cut to S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates for 2020 that we\u2019ve seen since March 1 is probably not enough.\u201d\n\n&gt; The ISM report points to a sharp upcoming drop in capital investment and a huge hit to earnings in the second quarter\u2014potentially down 40% year over year (FactSet consensus is calling for a 38% year-over-year decline in S&amp;P 500 earnings).\n\n&gt; Looking ahead, while the economic impact of the global lockdowns has been severe, we continue to be reassured by developing plans to reopen the economy, progress toward treatments and vaccines, and the resolve of Americans to get through this. We continue to expect a very strong rebound in manufacturing and the broad economy later this year.\n\n*****\n\n# Global Central Banks All In\n\n&gt; The Federal Reserve (Fed), the European Central Bank (ECB), and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) all met in the last week and while the show of power was minimal compared to recent weeks, they collectively reasserted their resolve to do whatever is necessary to support the global economy through the COVID-19 economic crisis. Rates are being held about as low as they can go, significant new programs to enhance market liquidity and support lending are in place, and, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, asset purchases have accelerated. In fact, with April not yet completed, central bank assets have risen over $3 trillion, the biggest two-month jump on record.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe central bank response to COVID-19 has been fast, effective, and built to impress,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAnd the market is seeing it. It\u2019s no coincidence that the market bottomed the day after the Fed rolled out a wide range of new programs addressing key areas of market and economic disruption.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Blog-Chart-20-04-30.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Overview of Recent Central Bank Activity\n\n&gt; The Fed concluded its most recent two-day meeting on Wednesday, April 29. Prior to the meeting the Fed had expanded its program supporting municipalities by lowering the minimum size of the city or county to qualify. The Fed left its target rate unchanged at 0 \u2013 0.25%. Through its policy statement and Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s comments, the Fed signaled that it is unlikely to remove its extraordinary policy support anytime soon, and we believe the Fed may hold its policy rate near zero into 2022. Asset purchases are currently open-ended and have expanded to include investment-grade and high-yield corporate exchange-traded funds.\n\n&gt; The BOJ met on Monday, April 27 and announced that it would lift its cap on buying government bonds, making purchases open ended, and triple the size of its corporate bond commercial debt purchases.\n\n&gt; The ECB met on Thursday, April 30 and announced new refinancing operations and that it would ease conditions on long-term loans to banks, encouraging banks to increase lending.\n\n&gt; With interest rates near zero, all major central banks have been expanding their economic support through new programs and increased asset purchases. Central bank are showing that in a time of crisis, their policy response is not limited to setting policy rates or even bond purchases. The expanded activity has all but eliminated the idea that the central banks are out of ammunition, both now and looking forward. There will come a time when these programs will end, balance sheets will unwind, and rates will rise. But until that time, central banks have shown that even prudent support in a time of economic distress is only limited by their imagination, keeping the old investing maxim \u201cDon\u2019t fight the Fed\u201d alive even in an age of zero rates.\n\n*****\n\n# Typical May Trading: A Month of Transition with Negative Predisposition\n\n&gt; Once again it is that time of the year where we increasingly see and hear \u201cSell in May.\u201d But when exactly in May is the \u201cbest\u201d time to sell? Based upon the last 21 years of data, the best time could be early in May. The month has opened well, on average, recently with strength on the first trading day and on the second trading day for the most part. Afterwards, DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 all tend to drift sideways to lower until around May\u2019s sixteenth trading day or so. It is on this day the NASDAQ and Russell 2000 begin to rally to finish the month. Beware though, this late-May rally typically fizzles before it can exceed the highs reached earlier in the month.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1df0a9e6bf9c57baf44e6917725a0b23/49574a3950141284-4d/s500x750/4f224d3ee89c6ef6d69c08facbac61a77da3fd3b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# This is Still an Election Year\n\n&gt; We have all been rather preoccupied with the coronavirus pandemic, market volatility and our individual situation. Meanwhile there is still a U.S. Presidential Election taking place this year. And folks are beginning to wonder what the next political alignment might be and the ramifications that alignment has had on the market historically.\n\n&gt; Six possible political alignments exist in Washington: Republican President with a Republican congress, Democratic congress or split Congress; and a Democratic President with a Democratic Congress, Republican Congress or split Congress. Data presented in the chart below begin in 1949 with the first full presidential term following WWII.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dce5f19dd2ccfc16a4e0795dd5a11f68/8033867962439c40-45/s500x750/8543ffd66d568035ffa681a3d72b861c8f84b996.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Election years are traditionally up years. Incumbent administrations shamelessly attempt to massage the economy so voters will keep them in power. But sometimes overpowering events occur and the market crumbles, usually resulting in a change of political control.\n\n&gt; Republicans won in 1920 (DJIA -32.9%) as the post-war economy contracted and President Wilson ailed. The Democrats came back during the 1932 (-23.1%) Depression when the Dow hit its lowest level of the 20th century. A world at war and the fall of France jolted the market in 1940 (-12.7%), but Roosevelt won an unprecedented third term. Cold War confrontations and Truman\u2019s historic upset of Dewey held markets down through the end of 1948 (-2.1%). Recently the Great Recession and bear market of 2008 (-33.8%) helped put Obama and the Democrats back in the White House.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fe57b47990e4b1b913e16595818a4df4/8033867962439c40-ea/s500x750/b5004568a1ca04f9004d23bd405de22f277408f2.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# 10-Day Advance/Decline Lines Running Hot\n\n&gt; The gains in the first half of the week lifted every sector but two\u2014Utilities and Financials\u2014above their 50-DMAs. Meanwhile, Health Care had even touched overbought territory (over 1 standard deviation above its 50-day) earlier in the week, making it the first sector to be overbought since late February.\n\n&gt; When it comes to another measure we monitor, the 10-day advance/decline line, conditions are more broadly appearing overbought. The 10-day advance/decline line measures the average number of daily advancers minus decliners in an index or sector over the last 10 trading days. Very high readings suggest that things have gotten extended in the very near term and downside mean reversion can be expected. Very low reading suggest the opposite.\n\n&gt; The 10-day A/D lines for sectors have been pretty strong recently indicating broad participation in the rally, but this has led these readings to become elevated indicating conditions may be running a bit too hot in the near term. Outside of the defensive sectors like Consumer Staples, Utilities, and Real Estate, every sector's 10-day A/D line has been in overbought territory at some point over the past week. The same can also be said for the 10-day A/D line for the S&amp;P 500. We'd note, though, that while A/D lines are extended, they're not at extreme levels seen at other points over the past year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/10day.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 4th, 2020.\n\n# **April\u2019s jobs report showing millions out of work looms large in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/01/aprils-jobs-report-showing-millions-out-of-work-looms-large-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Investors will focus on the slow reopening of the economy in the coming week, as Friday\u2019s dismal April employment report is expect to paint a frightening picture of the most rapid job losses in history.\n*****\n&gt; The unemployment rate is expected to jump from 4.4% to over 16.1% in April, the highest level since 1939, according to Dow Jones. Job losses are estimated to total 22 million, slightly below the entire number of jobs that were recovered since the Great Recession.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said the market will likely be able to look past the terrible jobs number as it has done with most bad data, showing the results of a sudden and unprecedented shutdown of the economy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think people are too gloomy about the unemployment situation. I think they think the unemployment rate is going to rise through the summer,\u201d said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont. \u201cI think the unemployment rate probably peaks in May.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Earnings season continues with dozens more companies reporting first-quarter results and talking about the impact of the virus and shutdowns on their businesses. So far, earnings appear to be down 12.7% in the first quarter, based on actual reports and estimates, according to Refinitiv. A diverse group of companies report, including Walt Disney, General Motors, CVS Health and Bristol-Myers Squibb.\n*****\n&gt; But investors are watching the restarting of the economy, now underway at some level in many states. \u201cIf they go well that\u2019s a good thing, but if in a week or two, you start to see some bad virus numbers, that\u2019ll be a blow to confidence,\u201d said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo.\n*****\n&gt; # Best April in years\nStocks started May with a sharp decline Friday, after a 12.7% gain in the S&amp;P 500 in April, its best month since 1987.\n*****\n&gt; Sam Stovall, CFRA chief investment strategist, said the market had been looking forward to the latest extension of fiscal stimulus, approved by Congress, and comments from the Fed, which reaffirmed after its meeting Wednesday that it will do whatever is needed to help the economy. \u201cNow there\u2019s not that much to look forward to,\u201d he said, adding the market would react negatively to any resurgence in the coronavirus outbreak.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe had a very nice April, the best April since 1938. May is sort of a ho-hum month,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cIt\u2019s in the bottom half in terms of average price change, slightly below average in terms of frequency of an advance. \u2026 Just looking at last year, May tends to digest April\u2019s gains.\u201d The S&amp;P 500\u2032s April gain was its best for the month in 82 years.\n*****\n&gt; # Virus economy\nEconomists and market strategists have been tracking the progress of the virus state by state, watching hospitalization rates, new cases and recoveries for clues on how quickly the economy might be able to restart. The economy is expected to have plunged into a deep recession in the second quarter, contracting by 35% or more, after a 4.8% decline in the first quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Stanley said he expects the unemployment rate to be a better-than-consensus 11.6% in April before it rises again in May. \u201cThis is all a stab in the dark,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s not going to come down as quickly as it went up,\u201d said Stanley. \u201cBut I do think you\u2019re going to see steady improvement. I think you\u2019re going to see millions of people brought back into the payrolls for several months in succession. I think we can get out of the double digits [unemployment] by the end of the summer.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Some workers are expected to return to their company payrolls as a result of the small business-focused Paycheck Protection Program, which encourages companies to keep workers on their payroll and bring back those who were cut. But that may not show up until May or June as a factor in the jobs data, Stanley said.\n*****\n&gt; Millions more are expected to have filed for unemployment claims in the week ending May 2, on top of the 30 million who filed in the previous six weeks. Economists say with such big unprecedented numbers, it is difficult to predict the unemployment rate since some people may have been temporarily unemployed and expect to return to work.\n*****\n&gt; But regardless, the number could be a shocker even though the market has shrugged off the big numbers of jobless claims and focused instead on the virus curve flattening.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it could spook people,\u201d said Schumacher. \u201cIn the markets, we\u2019ve been watching the weekly claims, but everybody knows what unemployment is.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stanley said he is also watching Tuesday\u2019s ISM nonmanufacturing data, a look at the services sector during April. A cross section of March data shows it was the services sector that took the biggest hit in the shutdowns, and it\u2019s unclear how quickly it can recover.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere are people who will go and do things as soon as they\u2019re allowed to, and there are people who are going to stay home for a month or two longer,\u201d he said. \u201cI do think expecting we\u2019re going to pack 100,000 people into a football stadium in September is way too optimistic.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stanley said some of the steep drop in consumer spending in March was the result of consumers stopping spending on health care, including elective surgery. That actually is an area that can bounce back quickly once the health care system is up and running for non virus related treatments.\n*****\n&gt; # A new 20-year bond\nThe Treasury could announce its new 20-year bond on Wednesday, when it discloses its quarterly refunding requirements, Schumacher said. He expects about $21 billion of the new 20-year to be issued in the second quarter.\n*****\n&gt; The amount of Treasury debt is expected to grow in the second quarter to help fund the growing deficit, made bigger by the trillions the government is spending to combat the virus.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe supply announcement we think is significant because you\u2019re going to see large auction increases, not just for one month but set in motion for many months to come,\u201d said Schumacher. He expects Treasury to announce $330 billion in notes and bonds in the refunding for the second quarter, up from $240 billion in the first quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury bill issuance is expected at $1.9 trillion in the second quarter but Schumacher expects that to fall to $260 billion in the third quarter. The bills were used to give the Treasury cash to pay for emergency programs and more of that debt will move to long term debt.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/lucZqhO.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ScMf5ki.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/lTrieA0.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/a6RSgrj.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9mfZglW.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Rkt7Uup.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8Ru9JJy.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1L1YEEG.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DwM4sys.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OxcbRYQ.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/zvZWYtm.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/93bme56.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/b57XIzN.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# US Manufacturing Sector Has Entered a Deep Recession\n\n&gt; It is a foregone conclusion that the US economy has entered recession, led by the consumer, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the US economy based on gross domestic product (GDP). The collapse of consumer spending was evident in March personal consumption expenditures data released on Wednesday that showed a record 7.5% month-over-month drop in consumer outlays. It would have been worse if we weren\u2019t stocking our refrigerators and pantries.\n\n&gt; The manufacturing sector is also contracting sharply, not surprisingly given the business shutdowns that began in March. Investors had a glimpse of the extent of the hit to manufacturing in the business investment component of first quarter GDP, which revealed a sharp 8.6% annualized decline, durable goods orders for March, which fell 14.4%, and Markit\u2019s preliminary Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) for manufacturing in April that came in at 36.9, a level consistent with a severe recession.\n\n&gt; Today\u2019s Institute for Supply Management (ISM) PMI for manufacturing\u2014the so-called official PMI\u2014provided more evidence of the depth of the manufacturing downturn. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the headline index fell 7.6 points to 41.5, better than Bloomberg\u2019s consensus forecast of 36, but a level consistent with prior recessions.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ISM-Chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; But that\u2019s the good news. Peeling back the onion in this report reveals that the headline number was inflated by the supplier deliveries component. Normally, lengthening supplier delivery times reflect strong demand, which prevents suppliers from keeping up. However, in this environment, it reflects supply chain disruptions from lockdowns around the world related to COVID-19.\n\n&gt; The new orders and employment components of the report, which both fell more than 15 points to around 27, are better indicators of where manufacturing activity in the US is right now. The new orders number just missed the December 2008 level of 25.9, while the employment component hit its lowest level since 1949, putting the slump into proper perspective.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe more forward-looking components of the ISM report clearly indicate the manufacturing sector is in the midst of one of the sharpest contractions ever,\u201d said LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. \u201cGiven the close relationship between manufacturing activity and corporate profits, the 25% cut to S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates for 2020 that we\u2019ve seen since March 1 is probably not enough.\u201d\n\n&gt; The ISM report points to a sharp upcoming drop in capital investment and a huge hit to earnings in the second quarter\u2014potentially down 40% year over year (FactSet consensus is calling for a 38% year-over-year decline in S&amp;P 500 earnings).\n\n&gt; Looking ahead, while the economic impact of the global lockdowns has been severe, we continue to be reassured by developing plans to reopen the economy, progress toward treatments and vaccines, and the resolve of Americans to get through this. We continue to expect a very strong rebound in manufacturing and the broad economy later this year.\n\n*****\n\n# Global Central Banks All In\n\n&gt; The Federal Reserve (Fed), the European Central Bank (ECB), and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) all met in the last week and while the show of power was minimal compared to recent weeks, they collectively reasserted their resolve to do whatever is necessary to support the global economy through the COVID-19 economic crisis. Rates are being held about as low as they can go, significant new programs to enhance market liquidity and support lending are in place, and, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, asset purchases have accelerated. In fact, with April not yet completed, central bank assets have risen over $3 trillion, the biggest two-month jump on record.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe central bank response to COVID-19 has been fast, effective, and built to impress,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAnd the market is seeing it. It\u2019s no coincidence that the market bottomed the day after the Fed rolled out a wide range of new programs addressing key areas of market and economic disruption.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Blog-Chart-20-04-30.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Overview of Recent Central Bank Activity\n\n&gt; The Fed concluded its most recent two-day meeting on Wednesday, April 29. Prior to the meeting the Fed had expanded its program supporting municipalities by lowering the minimum size of the city or county to qualify. The Fed left its target rate unchanged at 0 \u2013 0.25%. Through its policy statement and Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s comments, the Fed signaled that it is unlikely to remove its extraordinary policy support anytime soon, and we believe the Fed may hold its policy rate near zero into 2022. Asset purchases are currently open-ended and have expanded to include investment-grade and high-yield corporate exchange-traded funds.\n\n&gt; The BOJ met on Monday, April 27 and announced that it would lift its cap on buying government bonds, making purchases open ended, and triple the size of its corporate bond commercial debt purchases.\n\n&gt; The ECB met on Thursday, April 30 and announced new refinancing operations and that it would ease conditions on long-term loans to banks, encouraging banks to increase lending.\n\n&gt; With interest rates near zero, all major central banks have been expanding their economic support through new programs and increased asset purchases. Central bank are showing that in a time of crisis, their policy response is not limited to setting policy rates or even bond purchases. The expanded activity has all but eliminated the idea that the central banks are out of ammunition, both now and looking forward. There will come a time when these programs will end, balance sheets will unwind, and rates will rise. But until that time, central banks have shown that even prudent support in a time of economic distress is only limited by their imagination, keeping the old investing maxim \u201cDon\u2019t fight the Fed\u201d alive even in an age of zero rates.\n\n*****\n\n# Typical May Trading: A Month of Transition with Negative Predisposition\n\n&gt; Once again it is that time of the year where we increasingly see and hear \u201cSell in May.\u201d But when exactly in May is the \u201cbest\u201d time to sell? Based upon the last 21 years of data, the best time could be early in May. The month has opened well, on average, recently with strength on the first trading day and on the second trading day for the most part. Afterwards, DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 all tend to drift sideways to lower until around May\u2019s sixteenth trading day or so. It is on this day the NASDAQ and Russell 2000 begin to rally to finish the month. Beware though, this late-May rally typically fizzles before it can exceed the highs reached earlier in the month.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1df0a9e6bf9c57baf44e6917725a0b23/49574a3950141284-4d/s500x750/4f224d3ee89c6ef6d69c08facbac61a77da3fd3b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# This is Still an Election Year\n\n&gt; We have all been rather preoccupied with the coronavirus pandemic, market volatility and our individual situation. Meanwhile there is still a U.S. Presidential Election taking place this year. And folks are beginning to wonder what the next political alignment might be and the ramifications that alignment has had on the market historically.\n\n&gt; Six possible political alignments exist in Washington: Republican President with a Republican congress, Democratic congress or split Congress; and a Democratic President with a Democratic Congress, Republican Congress or split Congress. Data presented in the chart below begin in 1949 with the first full presidential term following WWII.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dce5f19dd2ccfc16a4e0795dd5a11f68/8033867962439c40-45/s500x750/8543ffd66d568035ffa681a3d72b861c8f84b996.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Election years are traditionally up years. Incumbent administrations shamelessly attempt to massage the economy so voters will keep them in power. But sometimes overpowering events occur and the market crumbles, usually resulting in a change of political control.\n\n&gt; Republicans won in 1920 (DJIA -32.9%) as the post-war economy contracted and President Wilson ailed. The Democrats came back during the 1932 (-23.1%) Depression when the Dow hit its lowest level of the 20th century. A world at war and the fall of France jolted the market in 1940 (-12.7%), but Roosevelt won an unprecedented third term. Cold War confrontations and Truman\u2019s historic upset of Dewey held markets down through the end of 1948 (-2.1%). Recently the Great Recession and bear market of 2008 (-33.8%) helped put Obama and the Democrats back in the White House.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fe57b47990e4b1b913e16595818a4df4/8033867962439c40-ea/s500x750/b5004568a1ca04f9004d23bd405de22f277408f2.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# 10-Day Advance/Decline Lines Running Hot\n\n&gt; The gains in the first half of the week lifted every sector but two\u2014Utilities and Financials\u2014above their 50-DMAs. Meanwhile, Health Care had even touched overbought territory (over 1 standard deviation above its 50-day) earlier in the week, making it the first sector to be overbought since late February.\n\n&gt; When it comes to another measure we monitor, the 10-day advance/decline line, conditions are more broadly appearing overbought. The 10-day advance/decline line measures the average number of daily advancers minus decliners in an index or sector over the last 10 trading days. Very high readings suggest that things have gotten extended in the very near term and downside mean reversion can be expected. Very low reading suggest the opposite.\n\n&gt; The 10-day A/D lines for sectors have been pretty strong recently indicating broad participation in the rally, but this has led these readings to become elevated indicating conditions may be running a bit too hot in the near term. Outside of the defensive sectors like Consumer Staples, Utilities, and Real Estate, every sector's 10-day A/D line has been in overbought territory at some point over the past week. The same can also be said for the 10-day A/D line for the S&amp;P 500. We'd note, though, that while A/D lines are extended, they're not at extreme levels seen at other points over the past year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/10day.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;
