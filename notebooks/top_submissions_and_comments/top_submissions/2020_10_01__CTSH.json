        "selftext": "Summarized to save you time.\n\n**Meadows says Pelosi and Mnuchin made progress on stimulus, but big differences remain:**\n\n* [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/20/coronavirus-stimulus-update-pelosi-says-relief-deal-with-mnuchin-getting-closer.html) cited comments from White House Chief of Staff Meadows, who said House Speaker Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin made progress in stimulus talks on Tuesday and will talk again on Wednesday. However, also noted that big differences remain. While White House increased its offer to nearly $1.9T, Pelosi is sticking to a $2.2-2.4T range. Pelosi also noted earlier that the two sides have not bridged their differences on issues such as state and local government funding and liability protections. These are the same issues that have weighed on stimulus talks for months. Even if the two sides are able to reach a deal, there is significant resistance to a large stimulus package among Senate Republicans. Senate Majority Leader McConnell reportedly waned the White House not to make a big stimulus deal before the election ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/10/20/trump-economic-stimulus-pelosi/)).\n\n**AstraZeneca vaccine trial may resume in US as early as this week:**\n\n* [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-astrazeneca-usa-ex/exclusive-astrazeneca-u-s-covid-19-vaccine-trial-may-resume-as-soon-as-this-week-sources-idUSKBN2752C5) reported AstraZeneca's (AZN-US) coronavirus vaccine trial in the US could resume as early as this week after the FDA completed its review of a serious illness. Trial has been on hold in the US since early September after a participant in the company's UK trial became ill with what was suspected to be transverse myelitis. However, it has resumed elsewhere, including the UK. Follows comments from Moderna (MRNA-US) CEO St\u00e9phane Bancel, who said the FDA could grant emergency use authorization to the company's coronavirus vaccine in December if it gets positive interim results in November from a large clinical trial. Despite some recent trial pauses, vaccine optimism has remained elevated. Pfizer (PFE-US) reiterated last week that it may know if its coronavirus vaccine is effective by the end of the month and could file for emergency use authorization by late November.\n\n**September housing starts missed on multifamily weakness while building permits beat:**\n\n* September **housing starts** came in at 1.415M SAAR, below consensus for 1.457M and August's 1.388M downwardly revised pace (was 1.416M). Up 1.9% m/m and up 11.1% y/y. Single-family starts up 8.5% m/m. Northeast and South stronger and Midwest weaker. Multifamily starts fell 14.7% m/m. September **building permits** at 1.553M SAAR above consensus for 1.515M and August's revised 1.476M level (previously 1.470M). Up 5.2% m/m and 8.1% y/y. Strength was similarly concentrated in single family permits. Comes after a record **NAHB housing market index** for October released yesterday. Coming up are Sep **existing home sales** (cons 6.25M, prior 6M) on Thursday, Sep **new home sales** (cons 1M, 1.011M prior) on Monday, Sep **pending home sales** (cons and prior 132.8K) next Thursday.\n\n**Earnings activity picks up:**\n\n* Following the latest batch of Q3 results, just over 13% of the S&amp;P 500 has now reported Q3 results. According to FactSet, 88% of reporters have surpassed consensus EPS expectations, well above the 73% one- and five-year averages. In aggregate, companies are reporting earnings more than 18% above expectations, much better than the 8% and 5.6% one- and five-year average positive surprise rates. Following the record beat rate for Q2 earnings and positive revision trends during Q3, there has been some focus on a higher bar. Companies leveraged to at-home trends continue to report some of the strongest results. The Street remains upbeat on margin expansion/protection given the softer macro backdrop. Guidance raises have also been fairly well received amid lingering Q4 uncertainty. Capital return announcements have been another bright spot.\n\n**All sectors higher, with energy, financials the leaders:**\n\n* **Energy** led the market, with E&amp;Ps and oil-services names rallying. **Financials** outperformed on strength from banks (particularly regionals) after latest batch of earnings. **Communication services** was boosted by the megacap internets (a bit of drag from telecom space). **Consumer discretionary** beat the tape with help from autos/suppliers, multiline retailers, and hotels/leisure. Transports, building product helped **industrials**, but A&amp;D was mixed (LMT-US ). **Tech** sector was mixed. Some strength from AAPL-US and MSFT-US but semis saw some decliners and IBM-US was down on its report. **Materials** was an underperformer amid some weakness in steel (STLD-US) and agrochemicals. Pharma was a weak spot in **healthcare**. **Consumer staples** was the only sector lower, with tobacco a weight (PM-US down after its report).\n\n**Biden up 9 points over Trump in latest national poll but Trump narrows gap in Pennsylvania:**\n\n* [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/us/politics/biden-trump-times-poll.html) noted that the latest NY Times/Sienna College poll showed Joe Biden up 9 points over President Trump. Added that Biden has a modest or wide lead over Trump on all of the most pressing issues at stake in the election, except the economy, where voters are now evenly split after long favoring Trump. While Biden has long held a solid lead over Trump in the national polls, the battleground polls have been tighter and fit with thoughts that the race is by no means over. [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-battlegrounds-poll/trump-appears-to-cut-into-bidens-lead-in-pennsylvania-reuters-ipsos-poll-idUSKBN2742P9) noted that the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Biden's lead in Pennsylvania fall to 4 points from 7 points last week. In addition, Biden's lead in Florida halved to 2 points. However, Biden saw his lead over Trump expand in Wisconsin, Arizona and North Carolina, and remain unchanged at 8 points in Michigan.\n\n**DoJ set to file suit against Alphabet over Google antitrust:**\n\n* [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-to-file-long-awaited-antitrust-suit-against-google-11603195203) reported Justice Department to file an antitrust suit today against Alphabet (GOOGL-US), alleging that Google engaged in anticompetitive conduct to preserve monopolies in search and search-advertising. Comes amid broader regulatory scrutiny on tech giants, with nearly all state attorneys general separately investigating Google, and House antitrust subcommittee releasing report that Google, Facebook (FB-US), Apple (AAPL-US), and Amazon (AMZN-US) all wield monopoly power ([WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/house-panel-calls-for-congress-to-break-up-tech-giants-11602016985?mod=hp_lead_pos3)). Despite increased antitrust threat, there has been minimal market impact. Analysts have noted investigations likely to result in fines or tweaks to business models rather than full breakups with little bipartisan agreement on how to handle antitrust issues, while market still focused on leveraged to structural growth theme.\n\n**Energy M&amp;A picking up, but low-premium deals highlight industry struggles:**\n\n* [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/19/business/energy-environment/conocophillips-concho-oil-merger.html) and [Bloomberg](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/19/business/energy-environment/conocophillips-concho-oil-merger.html) discussed the pickup in M&amp;A activity in the energy sector. Noted that with companies having already cut back drilling, laid off workers and written off assets, they are increasingly focused on M&amp;A to reduce costs. These trends have been driven by the demand headwinds from the pandemic. Industry has also faced pressure from years of elevated debt loads, lackluster shareholder returns, value-destroying deals, and climate change concerns. All of these dynamics have weighed on takeover prices as more than half of the shale deals this year came with a premium of less than 10% over already depressed stock prices.
