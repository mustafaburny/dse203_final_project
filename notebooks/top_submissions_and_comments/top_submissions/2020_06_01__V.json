        "selftext": "\u201cDon\u2019t fight the Fed.\u201d That mantra is repeated as fact amongst almost every market participant across the globe (other than Davey Day Trader, who doesn\u2019t know what a central bank is). Based off of that logic, one could reasonably assume that the Fed and Jerome Powell are the reasons for this recent market rally. All of WSB is bullish, and you can\u2019t go more than four posts on WSB without seeing some exhausted money printer meme or a pro-Powell love fest. After a week of reading economic research papers nonstop, I think I have stumbled into something that the market and the Fed won\u2019t see until it is too late to stop.\n\nFull disclosure: I am not an expert and this post should not be construed as anything other than my opinions and theories. This will be an extremely long and conceptual post (with a lot of references to research papers) that focuses more on economics than any financial analysis. It is not hard to understand, but be prepared to read.\n\n**Fed Reaction to Coronavirus**\n\nThe Fed\u2019s reaction to coronavirus was extremely quick. After seeing what worked to stop the financial crisis in 2008, the Fed used the same playbook. Lower rates to near zero, buy treasuries (quantitative easing), buy mortgage backed securities, cut the reserve ratio to 0%. That playbook didn\u2019t work though, the market kept selling off though. The Fed then did something unprecedented, they started buying corporate bond ETFs. They only bought high grade corporate bonds at first, but quickly realized that they had to buy junk bonds in order to keep the corporate bond market stabilized. Recently, the Fed [quietly announced](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-mainstreet/fed-eases-terms-of-main-street-loans-tells-banks-to-start-disbursing-idUSKBN23F2N8) a ramp up of their Main Street lending program, along with guaranteeing 95% of the loans instead of a range of 85-95%. This implies, to me, that banks don\u2019t want to give out loans unless the Fed backstops them more. That will become important later in this post.\n\nThe Fed has also been buying commercial mortgage backed securities. These CMBSs are facing [extremely high levels of delinquency](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/cmbs-delinquencies-climb-in-may-with-hotels-and-retail-faring-worst-58714661). According to that article, 7.6% of all CMBS loans are delinquent as of May, along with 19.3% of hotel loans and 10% of retail loans. A [whistleblower report]{https://www.propublica.org/article/whistleblower-wall-street-has-engaged-in-widespread-manipulation-of-mortgage-funds) indicates that the loans in these securities did not go through much scrutiny and could be massively overpriced as well. These assets are so toxic that the Fed [won\u2019t even take that many of them](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/agency-commercial-mortgage-backed-securities/agency-commercial-mortgage-backed-securities-operations). In fact, the Fed has quietly [reduced their asset purchases](https://i.imgur.com/zlMFwbr.jpg) since the last week of March. This is just background information so I can explain what the Fed has been doing to the market so people can stop attributing the rally to Jerome Powell.\n\n**Reasons For the Rally**\n\nNow that I have explained what the Fed has been doing, I want to explain the reasons for this rally. This rally is driven by retail. How? Delta hedging. Some of you know about delta hedging, but for those who don\u2019t I will explain a quick summary. A retail investors buys a call from a market maker. That market maker, being more risk averse than we are accustomed to, doesn\u2019t like to sell naked options so the market maker will buy enough shares to become delta neutral. That means that as the call they sold goes up in price, they have shares that will cover most or all of their losses. Options are highly leveraged instruments, which is important because it gives retail the leverage that they need to get market makers to pump the market for them.\n\nThe important thing is that the analysts and value investors that are crediting the Fed for this rally don\u2019t understand the options market as well as degenerates like us do. Retail has been [piling in](https://i.imgur.com/xuzFRSw.jpg) to the stock market at an astounding rate, especially into everyone\u2019s favorite [broker](https://i.imgur.com/mNve5Mu.jpg). This data is as of the beginning of May and I suspect it\u2019s a hell of a lot higher. \n\nBloomberg published some more up to date data recently regarding small option traders buying calls. Take a look at [the graph](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ixvGtK3QI_Aw/v0/1400x-1.png) for yourself, it has gone parabolic. The [Bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-09/speculative-fervor-in-u-s-stocks-surges-to-stunning-levels) states, \u201cTraders established fresh bullish positions last week by buying 35.6 million new call options on equities, according to Sundial founder Jason Goepfert. That\u2019s up from a peak of 28.7 million in February, when speculative activity was rampant, he wrote in a note Monday.\u201d The volume from small options traders is estimated to be 50% in that same article, the highest since 2000. Google Trends for [\u201chow to trade options\u201d](https://i.imgur.com/6nf8LTw.png) and [\u201crobinhood trade options\u201d](https://i.imgur.com/4NJwVfh.png) have gone parabolic recently as well. The put/call ratio across all equities is also at [historic lows](https://c.stockcharts.com/c-sc/sc?s=%24CPCE&amp;p=D&amp;b=5&amp;g=1&amp;i=p77530317141), indicating a mass wave of euphoria and a lack of hedges. \n\nAfter seeing all of this, it is clear to me that this is a retail driven bubble and not driven by the Fed after April. Where is retail getting the money for this? The answer lies in the [savings rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PSAVERT). According to the Fed, the savings rate \u201cis calculated as the ratio of personal saving to DPI. Personal saving is equal to personal income less personal outlays and personal taxes; it may generally be viewed as the portion of personal income that is used either to provide funds to capital markets or to invest in real assets such as residences.\u201d As you can see in the graph, the savings rate is now significantly higher than it has ever been before, coming in at 33%. This means that consumers are not spending money, they are saving or investing it. Consumers are also paying down [credit card debt](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TOTALSL) at much higher rates than anticipated. In the month of April, consumer credit had the [largest decrease since tracking began in 1968](https://eyeonhousing.org/2020/06/april-consumer-credit-indicates-recovery-challenges/). Remember the data in this paragraph, I\u2019m going to refer to it later in regards to deflation.\n\n**Effects of Quantitative Easing**\n\nBefore talking more about the bubble, I am going to outline some data that shows the impact of QE on our economy since 2008 up until now.\n\nThe main effect of low interest rates along with quantitative easing is an increase in the money supply. You can see that increase [here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2). Typically throughout history, an expansion in the money supply has lead to an increase in the inflation rate. That [has not happened](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FPCPITOTLZGUSA), the Fed has struggled to hit the target inflation rate since the crisis. With such an increase in the money supply, hyperinflation is stopped by the velocity at which the money moves. In 2006, Ben Bernanke noticed this phenomenon, [stating](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/10/business/worldbusiness/10iht-fed.3490493.html), \u201cthe empirical relationship between money growth and variables such as inflation and nominal output growth has continued to be unstable.\u201d A recent [research paper](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ecolet/v182y2019icp23-25.html) has also found a significant positive correlation between wealth inequality and monetary growth.\n\nVelocity of money is defined by the Fed as: \u201cthe frequency at which one unit of currency is used to purchase domestically- produced goods and services within a given time period. In other words, it is the number of times one dollar is spent to buy goods and services per unit of time. If the velocity of money is increasing, then more transactions are occurring between individuals in an economy.\u201d This velocity has been trending downward in a big way since 2008 (and before), not just in the US but everywhere. Velocity of the M2 money supply in the US broke through the previous low (tracking started in 1960) by 2012. Velocity is now [significantly lower](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V). M2 velocity includes bank reserves though, so let\u2019s take a look at the [velocity of M1](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1V) (which is physical currency and checking account deposits). [Demand deposits](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WDDNS) (checking account balances) have been exploding since 2008, with another massive jump starting in March. This means that cash is not being used and not adding to consumer prices or any economic productivity. I believe all of this to be an effect of QE and a prolonged period of low rates.\n\n**Liquidity Trap**\n\nThere has been a safe asset shortage since the advent of QE, as central banks of developed economies accumulate safe government bonds and US treasuries. This has lead to a shortage of safe assets, driving prices up and yields down artificially. Ricardo Caballero, an MIT economist, said [this](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1257/jep.31.3.29) (warning: PDF) in 2017: \u201cThe ongoing pressures driving the imbalance in safe asset markets has in recent decades helped to drive the steady decline in interest rates on safe assets. However, interest rates on these assets cannot fall much further. When the equilibrium full-employment interest rate needs to be negative, but cannot adjust sufficiently downward, then (other things equal) the equilibrating mechanism is an endogenous decline in safe asset demand through a reduction in aggregate income and wealth. That is, equilibrium is achieved through recession.\u201d At the end of 2019, the Fed owned [36% of all US treasuries](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/funding-covid-19-debt-splurge-risks-the-independence-of-major-central-banks-58610836), with that number only set to increase after their open market operations this year. of April 21st, central banks around the world have bought [5 times](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/central-banks-buy-trillion-financial-assets-g7-march-federal-reserve-2020-4-1029113160) the value of treasuries as they did in 2008.\n\nThis shortage of safe assets has pushed yields down and made it so that banks have no desire to make loans to decrease their reserves. Take a look at the [excess reserves](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/EXCSRESNS) banks have been holding. Since the 2008 crisis, excess reserves have exploded. This means that the bank is sitting on cash that they are doing nothing with. The common belief is that lending goes up as rates go down, since banks have to make more loans in order to sustain the same amount of profit. However, the data does not show that to be the case since the introduction of QE. The key thing that I have noticed in regards to excess returns and loans is that banks do not want to make loans at these low yields, possibly due to the massive unpriced systemic risk of our debt bubble popping. In Q1 2020, banks tightened their loan standards at a rate [comparable to 2008](https://www.barrons.com/articles/banks-are-tightening-lending-standards-like-it-was-2008-again-51588881348).\n\nA liquidity trap is created when low interest rates are low and consumers and institutions decide to save money instead of investing in low yielding bonds. The Fed started paying banks a [small risk free interest rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IOER) in 2008, which moves along with the Fed funds rate. I theorize that the shortage of safe assets and low interest rates has gone past the \u201creversal rate\u201d and accommodative monetary policy has become contractionary. In these uncertain times, banks would rather collect the small guaranteed risk free interest rate instead of introducing their balance sheets to any more risk, especially underpriced risk. The Fed believes that they are stimulating lending by cutting rates to 0. However, banks appear to not want to make non-guaranteed loans and instead are content to sit on their excess reserves. This means that the expansion of the monetary supply is not working as intended and that the money sitting in bank reserves is becoming contractionary. If loans aren\u2019t being made and that money isn\u2019t being spent, then that money may as well not exist in the money supply at all. According to a [Princeton economist](https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/markus/files/25b_reversalrate.pdf) (PDF), quantitative easing raises this reversal interest rate and should only be done after rate cuts are exhausted. This means that the Fed could be unknowingly contracting the money supply, even though it appears that they are massively expanding it on paper.\n\n**Deflation**\n\nDeflation occurs when institutions and individuals don\u2019t spend their money in the real economy, whether by purchasing goods/services or making loans to businesses. The Fed\u2019s [deflation probability](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/STLPPMDEF), which is the possibility that personal consumption expenditures price index change will go below 0 in the next 12 months, spiked from .001 in January to .763 in May. The [probability](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/STLPPM) that we have inflation over 2.5% over the next 12 months has crashed down to .002 as of last month. As shown in the data above, consumers aren\u2019t spending and banks are stockpiling their reserves. This is deflationary and will lead to lower prices, lower corporate earnings, and lower asset prices.\n\nAs mentioned in the data further up in the post, consumer credit dropped at a much quicker rate than expected, even with projections taking coronavirus into account. Economists expected consumer credit to fall by [$14 billion](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-consumer-credit-plummets-in-april-as-credit-card-use-tumbles-by-record-amount-2020-06-05) in April, but it fell by $68.8 billion instead. This was the largest one month drop in consumer borrowing since 1943. The core consumer price index (CPI) also [missed expectations](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/10/us-consumer-price-index-may-2020.html) of a 0-0.1% jump, instead falling by 0.1% for last month. This came after April was the largest drop (-0.4%) on record since data started in 1957.\n\nAccording to [research from the Netherlands central bank](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ecosys/v42y2018i1p45-63.html) (PDF), QE encourages risk taking by market participants and creates asset pricing bubbles. We are seeing bubbles across all asset classes thanks to the levels of debt in the economy (the stock market being an example). We even see debt bubbles too, like the $9 trillion of [corporate debt](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/21/theres-a-9-trillion-corporate-debt-bomb-bubbling-in-the-us-economy.html) (as of 2018) which help fuel these asset bubbles. The research from the Netherlands central bank also shows that asset bubbles popping are worth -4% inflation. An asset price bubble does not signal inflation either. I have picked out some quotes from the researcher that show QE might be leading to deflation:\n\n&gt;Overall, the results suggest that the signaling value of asset prices for inflation is weak and unstable, implying that while QE is effective in boosting asset prices \u2013 one of the main transmission channels of QE \u2212 higher asset prices may not always lead to higher inflation. High asset prices may even precede a low inflation regime. For policymakers this is useful information because, based on the outcome of our models, one cannot presume that QE by definition leads to higher inflation.\n\n&gt;If [\u2026] a surge in asset prices is not supported by real economic developments and therefore becomes unsustainable at some stage, the subsequent asset price collapse may cause a recession. \n&gt;While central banks intend to raise inflation by purchasing government bonds to reduce bond yields, our results indicate that this policy can have the opposite effect on inflation.\n\n**Conclusion: The Fake V-Shaped Recovery**\n\nI conclude after doing this research, that there is no chance of a V-shaped recovery in the economy, despite what the market is signaling. I believe that we are about to enter into a massive deflation cycle that is being assisted inadvertently by the Fed\u2019s policy of QE and the near 0% interest rates. Consumer credit is contracting and banks are stashing extra reserves, meaning that the real money supply is contracting. Default risk on commercial mortgage backed securities, corporate bonds (thanks to lower earnings), and other forms of debt will continue to rise as the economic effects of coronavirus and monetary policy undertaken by the Fed continue to be revealed. Defaults will rise even more if we get prolonged and sustained deflation as the weight of our debt crushes our financial system. I believe that, due to the historically high levels of retail activity in the market, it will crash soon as well. The wealth inequality effect of QE (which Powell denies the existence of) will make it increasingly harder for the economy to recover.\n\nAll of these things will feed off of each other as we get further into a deflationary cycle. It will be very difficult, if not impossible, for the Fed to get out of this crisis when we get into it. Deflation is rare historically and makes monetary policy ineffective, it is a central bank\u2019s worst nightmare. Deflation will dry up economic activity and cause us to go into a depression which will be difficult to get out of.\n\n**tl;dr**: Powell thinks he is injecting money into the economy but it really isn\u2019t going anywhere, the stock market is in a bubble that will pop very soon, corporate bond and CMBS default rates will increase over the coming year, deflation will make debt a heavier burden and cash more valuable, the Fed is powerless to stop it. Our economy enters a deflationary cycle that will be hard to get out of, until the bank reserves find their way into the real economy.\n\nI\u2019ve spent a very long time researching this stuff but I am not an expert in economics or monetary policy, just another idiot on WSB. I look forward to seeing any discussion or disagreement with the ideas that I have discussed.",

        "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/09/robinhood-traders-cash-in-on-the-market-comeback-that-billionaire-investors-missed.html\n\nOne 26-year-old Robinhood trader made $1,500 in less than 24 hours betting on a beaten-down airline stock, while many so-called experts on Wall Street warned about buying into an overvalued stock market that was bound to tumble again amid the coronavirus pandemic. \n\nLast Thursday, Lequon Godbolt, purchased a call option for American Airlines that made him $200 on the millennial-favored stock trading app.\n\nAfter seeing reports that the airline was increasing domestic flying for summer travel, Godbolt bought another call option minutes before the close. When the market opened higher last Friday after a surprisingly positive jobs report, Godbolt raked in his profits. \n\n\u201cI just started taking it seriously about two months ago,\u201d Godbolt \u2014 a New York resident\u2014 told CNBC. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching AAL since the beginning of that time and I felt eventually, once Covid relaxed, markets would move up.\u201d\n\nGodbolt is not alone is his success trading this market. One Chicago-resident flipped his sister\u2019s stimulus check into nearly $10,000. \n\nRobinhood traders lived up to their outlaw name during the coronavirus market downturn. The young investors booked profits \u2014 trading stocks with some of the best returns in the past two months \u2014 while other Wall Street veterans were left scratching their heads. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like momentum begetting momentum,\u201d Tim Welsh, founder and CEO of wealth management consulting firm Nexus Strategy, told CNBC. \u201cThe aspect of just access is really driving a lot of this and the whole upward tick in the markets, again, just fuels demand.\u201d\n\nYoung investors, like Godbolt, appeared to have a prescient understanding of the market, unlike the billionaire hedge fund managers who said stocks would retest their lows. Longtime investor Stanley Druckenmiller \u2014 who misjudged equities\u2019 comeback \u2014 said Monday that the market\u2019s strong performance over the last three weeks has \u201chumbled\u201d him and that he underestimated the power of the Federal Reserve.\n\nEven legendary investor Warren Buffett sold his stake in airlines during the pandemic. Of course, the Berkshire Hathaway chairman is a long-term, bargain shopper and the airline industry\u2019s long-term outlook is yet to be determined. \n\nV-shape after all?\nSigns are pointing to a V-shaped recovery \u2014 a sharp fall in economic activity followed by a dramatic rise \u2014 in the economy. This theory was rejected by economists and investors who found it unrealistic due to the detrimental ramifications of the mandated shutdown of the U.S. economy. \n\nStocks have soared in June, helped by the historic Labor Department jobs report that showed the U.S. economy added a record 2.5 million jobs in May. Wall Street was calling for a decline of 8.3 million. The unemployment rate dropped to 13.3%, far better than the expected 19.5% rate.",

        "selftext": "In this week's edition of DDDD (Data-Driven DD), we'll be exploring the most common way that investors calculate what a stock's actually worth, and then why this valuation method no longer anymore. Also, apparently mods disabled image uploads, so this post is going to be a bit hard to read since I rely a lot on visuals in them; please direct all your complaints to them.\n\n  \n*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so; look at what happened to all the SPY 220p 4/17 bag holders. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*\n\n# The Discounted Cash Flow Model\n\nThe DCF model is the most common model for valuing companies in finance, and hence the fair value of a stock. It\u2019s based on one simple principle: the value of a company is based on the ability of that company to generate cash flows in the future. This principle is used in virtually every other financial instruments, like bonds, and is also used to help aid capital expenditure decisions. This method of valuing a company became popular after the 1929 stock market crash, once the \u201cstonks\u00a0only go up\u201d mentality broke and investors started investing in equities based on value and returns rather than speculation, which drove much of the stock market in the 1920s, but this idea has been used as far back as ancient Egypt.\n\n**Time Value of Money**\n\nBefore looking into the math behind the DCF model, another principle needs to be understood - Time Value of Money. This is the principle that money today, or the Present Value, is worth more than money in the future, or Future Value. The difference in worth can be caused by many things, such as inflation, the interest rate of Treasuries (i.e. risk free rate), and risk of default. This difference of worth is calculated to some interest rate, r, which is then used to calculate the Present Value of some future cash flow.\n\n[Time Value of Money Formula](https://imgur.com/a/1DGJMFj)\n\n**Cost of Capital**\n\nIn the case of valuing a company, what would this rate be? Typically, the Weighted Average Cost of Capital, or WACC is used for this percentage.\n\n[WACC Formula](https://imgur.com/a/pBwR0xB)\n\nWACC in simple terms is the rate of return typically required to be paid by the company to shareholders and bondholders to raise capital from them. In this formula,\n\n*E is the market capitalization of all equity in the company*\n\n*D is the value of all debt in the company*\n\n*V = E+D*\n\n*Tc is the tax rate paid by the company*\n\n*Rd is the cost of debt, for simplicity let\u2019s say this is the average interest rate paid by the company for its outstanding debts*\n\n*Re is the cost of equity. The most common way of calculating this is the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), with the formula below*\n\n[Cost of Equity Formula](https://imgur.com/a/l8hRXa4)\n\nIn this formula,\n\nRf is the risk free rate, which is the interest rate an investor can receive when investing in some risk free asset, like a US treasury\n\n\u03b2 represents the volatility of a company\u2019s stock on the stock market; this value has its own complicated formula but this value can be usually found in most stock trading platforms\n\nRm is the long-term return of equity markets. Hence (Rm - Rf) is typically seen as the equity risk premium, which is the excess returns given by the stock market for taking on the risk of investing in equities rather than treasuries\n\n**Free Cash Flow**\n\nFree cash flow is typically reported as part of a public company\u2019s financial statements and hence can easily be discovered. Intuitively, it\u2019s the company\u2019s ability to generate cash from operations to pay back stock and bond holders, and is calculated by adding non-cash expenses (i.e. depreciation, amortization), subtracting capital expenditures, and adding increases in current assets - liabilities to the post-tax EBIT, or Earnings before Interest and Taxes.\n\n**Putting it all together**\n\n[Enterprise Value Formula](https://imgur.com/a/IXoFalW)\n\nWith all of these in mind, let\u2019s use them to calculate the Enterprise Value of a company. This is done by adding the sums of all future cash flows generated by the company, and discounting it by the weighted average cost of capital. Since a company can have a potentially perpetual stream of cash flows, and future cash flows beyond a few years becomes very unpredictable, we would instead only do this calculation for the first five years, and then add some \u201cTerminal Value\u201d of the company to represent how much the company would be worth by the end of that period, and discount that as well.\n\n[Terminal Value Formula](https://imgur.com/a/3dfSLS9)\n\nTo calculate this Terminal Value, we\u2019ll need to have some rate, g, which represents the \u201cgrowth rate\u201d of the company once it\u2019s mature and no longer growing rapidly (i.e. taking market share).\n\nOnce you add all of the discounted near-term cash flows and discounted Terminal Value, you now have the Enterprise Value. Once you have that, figuring out the fair value of all the equity in a company, or the market cap, is easy.\n\n**Fair Market Cap = Enterprise Value - Total Debt + Cash**\n\n# Where we are right now\n\nLet\u2019s see how recent events have changed the equation for equity valuations today compared to in January for the stock market overall.\n\n**Cost of Equity**\n\nRisk Free Rate - Looking at US Treasuries, this is this most obvious and well-known change in this equation, with yields plummeting from 1.5% from the start of the year to near 0% today.\n\n[Risk Free Rate Graph](https://imgur.com/a/LLcMoDC)\n\nMarket Risk Premium - This one is a bit complicated because it can\u2019t really be immediately calculated and is based largely on investor sentiment. Historically, market risk premium has been between 5% to 6% for the US stock market. This can easily change, however, based on economic and financial conditions. Right now, let\u2019s assume this has remained unchanged, but we\u2019ll get back to this later.\n\n**Cost of Capital**\n\nDebt - Corporate debt this year has exploded, with an [additional $1 Trillion raised by companies](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/29/corporations-raise-1-trillion-in-the-bond-market-after-fed-backstop-double-the-pace-of-last-year.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1591575861873000)\u00a0so far, more than double from last year at the same time of the year\n\nEquity - SPY started at this year at $325; As of time of writing, it\u2019s within 2% of this number\n\nCost of Debt - Despite skyrocketing bond yields in March as the economy experienced a liquidity crisis, bond yields have since stabilized, aided by the Fed backstop, and bonds yields are now at about the same levels as it was at the start of the year.\n\n[Bond Yields](https://imgur.com/a/wFITrco)\n\nSo assuming the risk premium being the same, compared to the start of the year, we have a slightly lower cost of equity from a lower risk free rate, roughly the same cost of debt, and having increased corporate debt, making the debt weigh more proportionally than before in our WACC. Since the cost of debt is usually slightly lower than the cost of equity, this provides a slight downwards pressure towards WACC as well. Thus, WACC has decreased by a small amount since January, due to increased debt levels and decreased risk free rates.\n\n**Free Cash Flow**\n\nFor most non-tech companies, the lockdown has severely hurt their cash flows, with many industries such as airlines burning billions of dollars per month. It\u2019s pretty hard to find up-to-date metrics of what free cash flow is for the S&amp;P500, so instead, I\u2019ll just use earnings as a proxy to make a very rough estimate of what it might look like. According to [one source](https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_051520.pdf) I found, Q1 saw the YoY decline of 14.6%, with an estimated 36% decline in earnings for Q2.\n\nWhat free cash flow looks like for the remainder of the year, and future years depends on two very fundamental questions.\n\nFirst, will there be a second wave of lockdowns later in the year? On one side of this, based on the history of similar pandemics and what most medical experts are saying, a second spike of cases is extremely likely to occur in the fall. On the other hand, the US population seemed to have stopped caring about the virus, and is currently distracted by other problems. It\u2019s unclear whether or not the US population will care enough to lock down the country once again when the second wave hits after being desensitized with the first wave. In fact the first wave never really stopped; the US just started pretending that the pandemic is over and it\u2019s time to go back to business as usual.\n\n[US Daily Cases](https://imgur.com/a/iVirLQ4)\n\n[Daily Cases for Italy; What \"flatten the curve\" actually looks like](https://imgur.com/a/fhaz2IR) \n\nThe second question, assuming the answer to the first question is \u201cNo\u201d, is what kind of recovery the US economy will see. According to [one source](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://conference-board.org/publications/Economic-Forecast-US&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1591575861874000), \u00a0\u201cV\u201d-shaped recovery will see earnings going back to normal as early as 2021. A \u201cU\u201d-shaped recovery, which will represent a recession, could see it take up until 2022 to return back to pre-COVID output levels. If we do see a second wave of lockdowns, then what might be seen is a \u201cW\u201d-shaped recovery, where we\u2019ll see a second steep decline in GDP, and prolong the recession and make it tougher to get towards a recovery as more businesses go bankrupt.\n\n[GDP Projections](https://imgur.com/a/jK78km1)\n\nMissing from this model is an \u201cL\u201d-shaped recovery, similar to what happened in Japan in the 1990s, and the US in the 1930s, which would represent a decade-long depression. This is what I personally believe would look like in [my long-term thesis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gqgwfg/dddd_cycles_and_human_history/), along with some of the most famous investors in the financial world, [like Ray Dalio](https://www.principles.com/the-changing-world-order/).\n\nBack to the DCF Model; we have an additional $1 Trillion of corporate debt. With a total market cap of $32 Trillion, the effect of this on the fair value of equities are negligible. With nearly the same market cap as in the beginning of the year, this would mean the market is pricing in the same Enterprise Value for the market as the start of the year. This implies either one of two things, based on the factors explained about\n\n1. The stock market has priced in a \u201cV\u201d-shaped recovery for earnings, with earnings and free cash flow beyond 2020 to remain unimpaired.\n2. The stock market has priced in a \u201cU\u201d-shaped recovery, but this is offset by a lower WACC as the market risk premium has significantly lowered. This can be caused by a few things, such as decreased perceived risk by investors of companies due to fiscal and monetary stimulus, and inflows of cash that was previously waiting in the sidelines (eg. retail investors), large international funds (eg. Saudi and Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth funds), and yield-seeking institutions as Treasury yields drop to 0%, with no prospect of a rate increase anytime soon.\n\n**Why Fundamentals Might Not Matter Anymore**\n\nThere\u2019s another thing that can explain the recent stock market movements other the reasons explained above of what the stock market was pricing in - a stock market bubble. This happens when speculation in the market overpowers fundamentals, and the money in the market is no longer investing for long-term, earnings-based gains, but rather trying to get short-term gains through speculation. In other words people throwing their money in the stock market aren\u2019t investing because they legitimately think the company has good fundamentals and will give a good return on their investment through earnings in the long term, but because they believe that stocks only go up, and hence they can make a quick buck by throwing some money in it and cashing out later and making money through capital gains. This is how every asset bubble starts, from the Dutch tulip-mania bubble, the English South Sea bubble, the 1920s stock market bubble, the dot com stock market bubble, and the real estate bubble in the 2000s.\n\nTo give an example to illustrate what\u2019s happening, let\u2019s look at one of the first major bankruptcies to have happened during the stock market crash - Whiting Petroleum (WLL). I\u2019ve previously covered WLL, but the most interesting part of it is the dislocation of the valuation of its stock and bonds.\n\nWLL [reached a bankruptcy agreement](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1255474/000119312520118310/d922194dex10.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1591575861876000)\u00a0with some of its key creditors on April 23. To be clear, this agreement has not been agreed upon with all its creditors and has yet to be approved by the court, and represents the best-case outcome for existing WLL shareholders; the court or creditors and reject this and demand better terms, or even worse, request to change the bankruptcy to a Chapter 7 and liquidate all the assets. The agreement was to restructure the corporation such that the bondholder will receive 97% of the restructured company\u2019s equity, and the remaining 3% will be given to existing shareholders and management.\n\nAs of this writing, the price for WLL bonds were all between $15 - $16.50.\n\n[Example WLL Bond Pricing](https://imgur.com/a/ktLeGQo)\n\nUsing this, we can calculate what the bond market is pricing the restructured WLL at; multiplying the market value of all the outstanding bonds by 97% would give you the implied price of it. From the most recent [10-Q](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc%3D/Archives/edgar/data/1255474/000125547420000011/wll-20200331x10q.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1591575861876000), the face value of all notes involved in the bankruptcy agreement is $2.4B. Using the highest bond price of $16.5, or 0.165% of face value, the implied market cap of the restructured WLL would be $2.4B \\* \u00a00.165% \\* 97% = $384M.\n\nWith 91M shares outstanding, this would mean the fair value of the old WLL shares would be $384M \\* 3% / 91M = $0.13. As of writing, the current share price is more than 10 times higher than this, at $1.38.\n\nHow could this be possible? It\u2019s because absolutely no one speculates with bonds, and bond prices are usually entirely grounded in fundamentals; people buying bonds buy it to hold onto it and not to sell it later at a higher price. The opposite is clearly happening with WLL stocks. Noone is buying WLL to receive a small stake in the reorganized corporation once the bankruptcy agreement clears in the best case; if an institution really wanted it, they would have just bought the bonds. Instead, people are buying these shares because they believe they can sell it shortly after for a higher price. This is what\u2019s going on in the stock market right now, which is how bubbles form.\n\n**Making Tendies in a Bubble**\n\nOkay, so you now believe, like me, that the stock market is now in a bubble, and has been in a [longer-term bubble for the last decade](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fzmlsv/spy_1125_150p/). Does this mean that I should sell all my long positions, buy puts, and short the market? Absolutely not. **Never short a bubble**. The whole idea of a bubble is that asset prices no longer reflect its intrinsic value, but is based on sentiment and speculation. Just because it\u2019s overvalued now doesn\u2019t mean it will immediately crash, and there\u2019s nothing stopping it from being even more overvalued in the near future; fundamentals aren\u2019t stopping it anymore. This has been the most clear the past week, with the first wave of COVID-19 cases never actually ending, bad vaccine news, and most US cities literally on fire, yet the stock market is skyrocketing for no apparent reason.\n\nInstead, my personal strategy is to play into this bubble, while holding a substantial amount of VIX calls as a hedge for when the stock market bubble eventually pops. I\u2019m holding VIX calls of multiple strike prices and expiry dates, mostly in Fall, since I personally believe the stock market will go back towards reality once more companies become insolvent (i.e. Fed can no longer help them), and a second spike in cases forces countries around the world to a second wave of lockdowns, as warned by most medical experts.\n\nIn the meanwhile, I\u2019ll be using Technical Analysis, which is most useful for markets on assets with no fundamentals and driven by pure sentiment, to drive my short-term and medium-term strategies. Some of you who have been following me for the past few weeks may know that my previous thesis revolved around SPY never breaking above 293 (+2%), which looked like it was going to happen until it didn\u2019t. This is because according to historical precedents, breaking above this level will bring SPY above the 62% retracement, and 200D EMA, and cause a 1W MACD crossover, which always resulted in a V-shaped recovery and new ATHs soon after. Of course, back then I believed fundamentals still mattered a bit and that this would not happen, but I was clearly wrong and it became clear we're in a short-term super-bubble within the longer-term bubble; SPY will be hitting new ATHs within the next few weeks.\n\nMy personal strategy for playing the bubble is the same as previous weeks, for those that have been following me - if the market is pricing in a V-shaped recovery, go long on the weakest and most beaten-down stocks that are not currently in bankruptcy, since those will be skyrocketing within the next few weeks as we see a rotation of capital from strong stocks like FAANG that have retraced back to their ATHs towards weak stocks, such as airlines, cruises, and banks. In other words, I'm literally inversing my strategy from a few months ago. Two weeks ago, some of these positions included CCL, JPM, and BA, which I entered into as soon as I saw their 1W MACD crossover, and have been doing phenomenally well last week. However, I have since exited BA and JPM and taken profit and rolled them into M, GE, WFC, and DAL, among other positions.\n\n[CCL, Daily](https://imgur.com/a/XZrR7kj)\n\n[BA, Daily](https://imgur.com/a/YXFkNji)\n\n[GE, Daily](https://imgur.com/a/RrZftMq)\n\n[DAL, Daily](https://imgur.com/a/7OrpvTa)\n\nMy strategy for these tickers\u00a0are simple - enter long positions (i.e. calls) as soon as they break the 24% retracement, which acted as a resistance for these industries until recently, and hence means that their stock price will skyrocket once it breaks it, and exit at the 50% retracements. BA and JPM have since hit these marks, so I exited. This week, I\u2019m holding calls from CCL, DAL, WFC, and GE, which has yet to have broken these levels. The market will probably need to consolidate next week because we\u2019ve had a lot of green days in a row, and it\u2019s getting pretty overbought, so I\u2019m not expecting these to print immediately. As I exit all of these positions and take profit, I\u2019ll be rolling half of the profits over towards more VIX calls for more hedging.\n\n# Live Updates\n\nAs always, I'll be posting some thoughts throughout the next few days in this thread below for people interested.\n\n6/7 8PM - Futures very green, especially /RTY, maybe the market is just gonna go for a 5th green day in a row with strong bullish momentum.",

        "selftext": "  \n\nBear season isn't over, and the market is about to get shafted. Here's why:\n\n1. JPOW\n\nThe fed talks recently confirmed the suspicion that the \u201cV-shaped recovery\u201d is a myth, and it\u2019ll take years for the economy to fully recover from this crisis. The feds could never outright say \u201cthe market is cucked\u201d, but they drop hints like these. In addition, inflation rates have decreased from 1.54% in March, to 0.33% in April, to 0.12% in May. We are dangerously close to deflation due to reduced consumer spending, and this is horrible for the economy/markets. \n\n2. Coronavirus\n\nThe fear of a second wave has obviously been around for a while, but it is recently picking up more steam. States like Arizona (who have been open for a while now) have reported a drastic uptick in coronavirus hospitalizations/cases. I know what you\u2019re thinking, with more testing means more cases\u2014which is true. But, more testing does not mean more hospitalizations. \n\n3. Overvaluation \n\nThe Buffet indicator is the composite market value of the market compared to the GDP. Levels over 30% are considered \u201covervalued\u201d, while levels over \u201c60%\u201d are considered \u201cstrongly overvalued\u201d. The last time the markets were considered over-valued was in 2000, during the internet bubble. Levels then were at 71%, and the market subsequently crashed. Currently, the indicator is at 74%.\n\n4. Hints from big money/institutions \n\nIt\u2019s funny how everyone on WSB shat on Buffet for selling his airline stocks at the bottom. Do you really think a bunch of RH autists know more than the smartest investor in the world? No. Furthermore, institutions have begun liquidating more assets, pulling more money out of the market. Again, who do you think knows more about the markets, you? Or the century-old, extremely successful \u201cbig money\u201d firms?\n\nPossible concerns: \n\n1. Trump pump \n\nIf the market gets cucked before his re-election, he stands almost no chance at winning. Trump will do everything in his power to continue pumping the market. We know that JPOW and bunker boy have big beef, and my concern is that orange man bullies JPOW into more Brrrrr and talk of negative yield rates. Trump even claimed he could instantly fire JPOW (which we know isn\u2019t as simple he says). This could continue to pump the market, extending the bubble further. \n\nTLDR: economy will take a while to recover, deflation occurring, market is overvalued, corona hospitalizations increasing, big money / Buffet dropping big hints to sell, but Trump might pump markets up. \n\nPlays: VXX calls, July expiry. Pick your poison with the strike price (whatever your RiSk tOleRanCe is). SPY puts, June/July Expiry. \n\nMy plays: VXX 7/10 45c. XLF 6/19 22p.\n\n\nEdit: furthermore, CCP is anticipating companies being delisted/prevented from being on American markets.

Apparently Canadians have about 700 billion in TFSAs and that figure will hit a trillion dollars within 5 years. There are about 20 million Canadians with TFSAs, so the uptake is about 80% (as you have to be the age of majority in your province/territory to open a TFSA).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasic TFSA rules are as follows:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStarting at 18 you get a certain amount of contribution room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAccording to the CRA:\n\n**You will accumulate TFSA contribution room for each year even if you do not file an Income Tax and Benefit Return or open a TFSA**.\n\nThe annual TFSA dollar limit for the years **2009 to** **2012** was **$5,000**.\n\nThe annual TFSA dollar limit for the years **2013** and\u00a0**2014**\u00a0was **$5,500**.\n\nThe annual TFSA dollar limit for\u00a0the year **2015**\u00a0was **$10,000.**\n\nThe annual TFSA dollar limit for the years **2016 to 2018** was **$5,500**.\n\nThe annual TFSA dollar limit for the year **2019** is $**6,000**.\n\nThe TFSA annual room limit will be indexed to inflation and rounded to the nearest $500.\n\nInvestment income earned by, and changes in the value of TFSA investments will not affect your TFSA contribution room for the current or future years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/contributions.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/contributions.html)\n\nIf you don't use the room, it accumulates indefinitely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTrades you make in a TFSA are truly tax free. But you cannot claim the dividend tax credit and you cannot claim losses in a TFSA against capital gains whether inside or outside of the TFSA. So do make money and don't lose money in a TFSA. You are stuck with the 15% withholding tax on U.S. dividend distributions unlike the RRSP, due to U.S. tax rules, but you do not pay any capital gains on sale of U.S. shares.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can withdraw \\*both\\* contributions \\*and\\* capital gains, no matter how much, at any time, without penalty. The amount of the withdrawal (contributions+gains) converts into contribution room in the \\*next\\* calendar year. So if you put the withdrawn funds back in the same calendar year you take them out, that burns up your total accumulated contribution room to the extent of the amount that you re-contribute in the same calendar year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nE.g. Say you turned 18 in 2016 in Alberta where the age of majority is 18. It is now sometime in 2020. You have never contributed to a TFSA. You now have $5,500+$5,500+$5,500+$6,000+$6,000 = $28,500 of room in 2020. In 2020 you manage to put $20,000 in to your TFSA and you buy Canadian Megacorp common shares. You now have $8,500 of room remaining in 2020.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSometime in  2021  - it doesn't matter when in 2021 - your shares go to $100K due to the success of the Canadian Megacorp. You also have $6,000 worth of room for 2021 as set by the government. You therefore have $8,500 carried over from 2020+$6,000 = $14,500 of room in 2021.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn 2021 you sell the shares and pull out the $100K. This amount is tax-free and does not even have to be reported. You can do whatever you want with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut: if you put it back in 2021 you will over-contribute by $100,000 - $14,500 = $85,500 and incur a penalty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut if you wait until 2022 you will have $14,500 unused contribution room carried forward from 2021, another $6,000 for 2022, and $100,000 carried forward from the withdrawal 2021, so in 2022 you will have $14,500+$6,000+$100,000 = $120,500 of contribution room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis means that if you choose, you can put the $100,000 back in in 2022 tax-free and still have $20,500 left over. If you do not put the money back in 2021, then in 2022 you will have $120,500+$6,000 = $126,500 of contribution room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is no age limit on how old you can be to contribute, no limit on how much money you can make in the TFSA, and if you do not use the room it keeps carrying forward forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can trade the following:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*stocks listed on an \"approved exchange\" which is the TSX, TSX-V, NASDAQ, NYSE, and about 20 other  exchanges worldwide, but not the US OTC pink sheets.\n\n\\*stock-like securities like ETFs and ETNs, including 2x and 3x leveraged\n\n\\*warrants\n\n\\*mutual funds\n\n\\*cash of any country\n\n\\*government bills and bonds of any country and most corporations\n\n\\*long puts and calls, and covered calls (short out of the money call and long the stock) but not option spreads\n\n\\* gold, silver bullion\n\n\\*shares in certain private companies -- but consult your tax advisor on this\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNothing inherently marginable like commodity, index or stock futures.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou cannot buy on margin in a TFSA. Nothing stopping you from borrowing money from other sources as long as within your contribution limits, but you can't trade on margin in a TFSA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis \"all-purpose\" flexibility is what makes the TFSA program so powerful, probably the most powerful program of its kind in the world, and Canada and the U.K. are the only countires that really have such a program.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe U.S. Roth IRA is superficially similar but much less powerful because contributions are limited by how much you make and there are age and purpose restrictions on withdrawing funds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe only other comparable program is the U.K. Investment Savings Account.",

        "selftext": "This is NOT DD but more so my speculation from scouring the internet and what I have discovered. **Interpret it as you'd like.** (This is also my first Reddit post, so please don't be too harsh)\n\nFor those that have performed DD, you know CEO Ted Murphy has been counting down to Friday, with the first mysterious message this past Sunday. These cryptic posts can be found on IZEA's Twitter and Instagram. Each message has had lyrics to Harry Belafonte's calypso song, *Jump in the Line (Shake, Senora)*.\n\n([Twitter](https://twitter.com/izea) \\---- AND ------ [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/izea/))\n\nAdditionally, with each message there has been a PR directly from IZEA or some sort of news:\n\n(Sunday:  [Zacks upgraded IZEA from Hold to STRONG-BUY](https://zolmax.com/investing/izea-worldwide-nasdaqizea-upgraded-to-strong-buy-at-zacks-investment-research/4246644.html))\n\nMonday: PR from IZEA  [Announces NEW Fortune 500 Customer](http://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/06/08/2045140/0/en/IZEA-Announces-New-Fortune-500-Customer.html)\n\nTuesday: PR from IZEA  [Announces New Contracts with TWO Fortune 500 Retailers](http://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/06/09/2045887/0/en/IZEA-Awarded-New-Contracts-by-Two-Fortune-500-Retailers.html)\n\nSO what is IZEA announcing Friday? Maybe revealing the *NEW* Fortune 500 customer. Maybe revealing the two Retailers that renewed contracts with IZEA, one of them a **Fortune 10** customer.\n\n[Current FORTUNE 10](https://preview.redd.it/83vzg0hu2z351.png?width=639&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d5904999c04eb786904c21c5a6e3626e79288c1)\n\nOn IZEA's [Customers landing page](https://izea.com/managed-services/our-customers/), Wal-Mart is (technically) the only current Fortune 10 company that previously has had a contract with IZEA. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pn2v0ffy2z351.png?width=995&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=471d7a737bf9826697169060a5e62a1baa2473ec\n\nHowever, we know that [Twitch and IZEA are already in bed together](https://izea.com/influencer-marketing/twitch/). And who owns Twitch? Yep, you guessed it...AMAZON. Could Amazon indirectly be the Fortune 10 customer because they own Twitch? Maybe. But Twitch is not on the above Customer's page which was surprising to me.\n\nThis brings me to the Jump in Line lyrics that have been used as captions on each of the Social Media posts so far. The song has had appearances in:\n\n1. [The Little Mermaid](https://youtu.be/5p6DUZUFC7E)\n2. [Beetlejuice](https://youtu.be/QooqZkNk8Bw)\n3. Even [Pitbull and T-Pain made their own version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmuKdoe8MvI) (screenshot of lyrics below so you don't have to listen to the song....)\n4. Steve Wozniak\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Shake Senora lyrics](https://preview.redd.it/xqspo4956z351.png?width=379&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef15c6818331ec2f9202fd9113c19884e95cef71)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Little Mermaid**: Disney is currently ranked 53rd in the Fortune 500. That eliminates them from being the Fortune 10 customer. Have they had a previous contract with IZEA? I couldn't find anything publicly but did confirm [the CEO has consulted with Disney before](https://izea.com/company/leadership/ted-murphy/).\n\n* [IZEA HQ is in Orlando, a short drive from Disney World](https://izea.com/contact-us/orlando/) (Keep in mind that Walt Disney Co. is technically HQed in Burbank, CA)\n* A Live-action remake of the Little Mermaid, originally announced back in 2016, was originally scheduled to begin production in April 2020. Then COVID happened. [Filming is now expected to begin as early as JULY 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid_(franchise)#Live-action_remake) \n* [They have finished recording all the music for the film](https://thedisinsider.com/2020/04/17/first-look-at-prince-erics-castle-for-the-live-action-the-little-mermaid/) \n\n**Beetlejuice**\n\n* Distributed by Warner Bros. A sequel has been shelved as of April 2019.\n* One of the most memorable appearances of this song was in Beetlejuice during the climax of the movie.\n* Warner Music Group ($WMG) - On June 3, WMG officially had its second IPO on Nasdaq (went private in 2011), raising $2 billion with a valuation of $12.75 bilion.\n* Could there be some connection to WMG? Unlikely, since Harry Belafonte released all his albums with RCA Victor which is owned by Sony Music. With no sequel in the works and Sony owning rights to Belafonte's albums, it's hard to find a connection there.\n\n**T-Pain**\n\n* In a \"random\" social media post today, IZEA gave a shoutout to a past marketing campaign for  [Target and Trident Gum](https://www.instagram.com/p/CBN8qj5h0OB/) \n* I reached out to the users tagged on this post to find out how recent the campaign happened but received no responses.\n* HOWEVER, this past February, T-Pain had a pop-up performance in Chicago to unveil his partnership with Trident Gum and drive awareness to their new product Trident VIBES gum.\n* Yes, T-Pain was featured in Pitbull's rendition of Shake Senora, AND partnered with Trident Gum for this recent marketing campaign that IZEA spotlighted on its social media accounts TODAY.\n   * \"The campaign produced 41 pieces of content, 295k+ social interactions, and an engagement rate of 10.32% \ud83c\udfaf Instagram stories drove 11x more click through traffic to the coupon redemption page than Instagram photos in this campaign\"\n*  [Trident's IG post revealing T-Pain partnership](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9Xio9NhifB/) \n* This still seems like a stretch to me, but Target is actually on IZEA's customer's page (link above), right next to Wal-Mart....\n* **Apple**\n* This one seems furthest from likely, but I wanted to include all my findings.\n* In 2009, in season 8 of Dancing with the Stars, Steve Wozniak danced a Samba to this song.\n* It was terrible lol. He got a 10 out of 30, the second lowest score in the history of the show. \"It was the only dance that got 3s or less and was not the celebrity's final dance.\"\n* Steve Wozniak co-founded Apple with Steve Jobs and AAPL, as you know, is #4 in the FORTUNE 10.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, this leaves us with the perpetual question:\n\n# What does it all mean? \n\nWell, I don't fucking know. But let us commence this Discussion. Share your feedback. Share your own thoughts that might connect some dots I didn't. Hell, maybe it'll become a megathread by Friday's announcement. I will add on as I make new discoveries. Bless everyone that is along for the ride! And cheers to all who may profit from IZEA.\n\n \n\nOP's Investments into IZEA:\n\nCurrently, here is my investment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xpgo5cuihz351.png?width=646&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ed3fa6bb775b22f4688b1fc4bea900864dc03e0\n\nLast month, I had owned 5,547 shares at an avg price of 0.6199. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/18tqh3tmgz351.png?width=701&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9221064dfc0547716cfa2d4f850cf576bb0f86f1\n\nWith weak hands, I regrettably sold for a loss to put that equity elsewhere.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rbrnongogz351.png?width=704&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c2e106b100f12a4e8244f1dfcb491f451d1d2c1",

        "selftext": "**Asset valuations**\n\nThere is a growing school of thought that the Fed and other central banks are driving an asset bubble when the evidence is wanting. In fact, I\u2019d go further than that and suggest that the Fed can stimulate away and should tolerate richer asset valuations yet.\n\n* First, on stocks, traditional relative measures that were recapped in yesterday\u2019s note showcase how stocks are not cheap but there is nothing particularly out-of-sample going on here. Yet investors are buying on a price relative to forward earnings basis over multiple quarters ahead in anticipation of a rebound. They\u2019re not buying stocks to get a claim on earnings this quarter (or lack thereof\u2026) or last quarter or even this full year\u2019s earnings that will be depressed by the first half experience. In fact, for the S&amp;P500, price compared to 2021 earnings expectations sits at about 20 times (chart 1). If the earnings rebound turns out to be anything close to analysts\u2019 expectations, then maybe\u2026.gasp\u2026stocks are cheap and nobody wants to say as much.\n\n* If so, then daily gyrations aside, stocks could have considerably more room to run. This runs counter to the common narrative that the Fed\u2019s stimulus is driving ridiculous stock valuations rather than viewing such valuations as based upon post-COVID-19 earnings expectations in a recovery (I\u2019ll come back to recovery evidence in a moment).\n\n* Second, given that the Fed looks at broad asset markets, we also need to do so. When I look at commodity valuations, we\u2019ve got a long way to go yet before we get to over valuation. Talked to the oil patch lately? Enough said.\n\n* Housing also doesn\u2019t seem over-valued. One gauge is homebuyer affordability that before the COVID-19 shock was only slightly more affordable than the two decade average. Another is repeat sales home price indices that were climbing by 4.4% y/y before the shock and well below the recent peak rate of growth in early 2018.\n\n* And then of course we have the Fed\u2019s preferred core PCE gauge of inflation that is likely to decelerate sharply over the faces downside risk over the duration of the year. Not only is evidence of asset inflation often overstated, it principally matters when it shows up in broad price signals and that\u2019s not likely to happen for some time.\n\n**Rebound expectations**\n\n* Equity analysts\u2019 earnings expectations are based upon underlying expectations for an economic rebound. In my opinion, there are already signs that the global economy is recovering and quite possibly going V-shaped which should inform a cautiously optimistic bias at the Fed. Heck, that\u2019s not even entirely a forecast as there is evidence that conditions are already headed there such that by the time GDP growth returns to the black in Q3 we\u2019ll already be well into recovery mode.\n\n* Look at the evidence. German restaurant bookings are soaring (chart 2). Chinese air travel has already recovered to well above where it was at the start of the year (chart 3). Global air travel is gradually recovering (chart 4). North American retail foot traffic is starting to recover, albeit out of a deep pit (chart 5). US homebuyer foot traffic is slowly inching higher (chart 6) and mortgage purchase applications have not only recovered the COVID-19 shock but are at levels seen well before the US economy shut down in mid-March (chart 7).\n\n* Is all of this durable? Some will argue this time is different and that we\u2019ll never return to the same activities. I wouldn\u2019t be so sure. As for second-wave COVID-19 risk, yes it\u2019s real, especially as reopening efforts gain speed and social inhibitions toward large gatherings so obviously decline. But will that stop the economy again? Probably not. One reason is that governments can\u2019t afford to do that all over again; to take on balance sheet the shut down economy again could risk deficits rapidly soaking up excess world saving and impairing the ability of companies and households to roll over debt from the last cycle. Governments across the world were running procylical fiscal policy with varying shades of abandon before the shock and this limited their flexibility to address this one.\n\nIs all of this durable? Some will argue this time is different and that we\u2019ll never return to the same activities. I wouldn\u2019t be so sure. As sophisticated as humans like to think we are as a species, we are not. We never change, or maybe we just adapt and move on by doing things differently, spending money in different ways or on different things with varying time periods toward a full recovery. History offers abundant evidence. I\u2019ve been doing this gig in one form or another for about a quarter century which is just barely enough time in the grand sweep of history\u2019s humbling lessons to have learned that every time a shock arises, we\u2019re told we\u2019ll never be the same again and things will never return to some sense of normalcy. We do. Every time that view turns out to be dead wrong. One of my favourite examples was when demographics best sellers told us during the early 1990s recession that an aging population meant fundamentally changed behaviour and we\u2019d never have another housing boom after the 1980s. Oops.\n\nCommentary from Scotia Bank: https://www.scotiabank.com/content/dam/scotiabank/sub-brands/scotiabank-economics/english/documents/closing-points/closingpoints_2020-06-09.pdf",

        "selftext": "**Abstract**\n\nHello all, today we are going to be discussing everyone\u2019s favorite meme stock, ~~Tesla~~ AMD! Before we get into the meat of the arguments for AMD and Intel, this is intended to be a follow up of another pretty crappy post I made a few months back, as such we will go into much further depth than before. Also I will not be providing price targets due to macro environmental circumstances.\n\nIn this post I will first have to cover some terms needed to talk about both companies\u2019 products, and some history. Then I will talk about how both are positioned in the present and the near term (next 6 months to a year), followed by long term speculation which I\u2019ll release later (next week maybe). Please note that I will briefly touch on NVIDIA and their products in the future speculation, but I will not go into depth due to there being a lot of misinformation circulating. I will most likely make another post doing a deep dive into the relation between NVIDIA, Intel, and AMD in late October/December.\n\n*Also note that I do not hold any shares or derivatives in AMD, Intel or NVIDIA.*\n\n**An introduction into the semiconductor industry**\n\nThe semiconductor industry is a massive industry currently valued at a massive 433b1, it is what powers all electronics ranging from the weakest smartwatch all the way up to the largest supercomputers. Semiconductors are made out of silicon oxide with transistors on them which perform logic functions and the likes. The semiconductor market has two large segments, that being the CPU market and the GPU market, with CPUs being used to compute a wide ranging set of data, whereas a GPU is used to perform lots of very repetitive tasks such as rendering. There are four primary companies in this space, that being Intel, AMD, NVIDIA, and ARM (note that Qualcomm and Samsung license their core architectures from ARM).\n\n*Some important terms that are needed to understand basic things that will affect performance/competitiveness.*\n\n1. Architecture: Refers to the design of a product think about it like how a house is built from a frame.\n2. Clock speed: How many cycles a CPU/GPU can perform, each cycle is the effectuation of a certain number of calculations.\n3. IPC: Instructions per clock refers to how many calculations a CPU/GPU can perform per clock cycle.\n4. Core: The \u201cprocessor\u201d in a CPU/GPU that performs the calculation\n5. Thread: present only in CPUs, allow multiple code paths to access a singular core at once thereby ensuring that the core is always fed with information.\n6. Monolithic design: A CPU/GPU using only 1 piece of silicon.\n7. MCM: Multi-chip module, a CPU/GPU that is composed of a multitude of pieces of silicon.\n8. Wafer: A disc of varying size in which the transistors are inlaid on, this will later be cut up into chips\n9. Chips: Smaller pieces of silicon which are typically a final product\n10. Node: Refers to how small a transistor is, measured in nano-meters (NM). Note however, it is more of a marketing term and the real size of the transistors are typically much larger, furthermore different nodes are intended to compete with each other, such as Intel\u2019s 10nm node being intended to be on parity with TSMC\u2019s 7nm node.\n11. Reticle limit: The maximum size a chip can be made on a certain node.\n12. EUV: Extreme ultraviolet, is the cutting edge of semiconductor manufacturing, uses high energy ultraviolet light to imprint the transistors on the wafer, allows for increased efficiency and better yields.\n13. Yields: Defect density of a wafer, if there is a defect on wafer the corresponding chip may be compromised and have to be thrown out or binned lower.\n14. Binning: The practice of sorting chips by how many defects they have, a chip with a lot of defects will have lower performance then one that has none.\n15. Cache: Small, low latency storage that allows for cores to quickly access data. Further divided into L1, L2, and L3 cache, with L1 cache having the lowest latency and lowest storage and L3 having the highest latency and the highest capacity.\n16. Memory/RAM: Fast storage that a CPU can directly access, note that it can not store as much data as traditional solutions, but latency and transfer speed are much higher. There are currently four generations of it, that being DDR1, DDR2, DDR3, and DDR4, with DDR4 being the newest. Memory also has clock speeds which indicates indirectly how fast the data transfer is.\n17. Fab/Foundry: Where wafers are made, the three largest ones are TSMC, Intel and Samsung.\n\n**A brief history of the relation between Intel and AMD**\n\nIntel was founded in 1968 by a few people you may know about, Gordon Moore, Robert Noyce, and Arthur Rock. Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce had left Fairchild Semiconductors with Arthur Rock providing the initial capital. Together the three made the first commercial CPU, the 4004.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nIntel 4004\n\nAMD was founded a year later in 1969 and initially produced memory, but in 1981 they entered in a 10 year partnership with Intel as a secondary supplier as requested by IBM. At the time, most OEMs required a secondary supplier to ensure that they would not become too reliant on one company and to ensure that they would have enough supply should one company have issues. This meant that Intel licensed their technology to AMD so they could produce them at their own fabs.\n\nThis partnership did not last long when in 1984 Intel broke the partnership, and violated the terms which in and after numerous appeals and cases of discovery abuse on the side of Intel resulted in the court's ruling in AMD\u2019s favor in 19902. Because of this AMD was forced to set out and create their own chips, initially copying Intel\u2019s 80C287, which would have been shared under the 10 year partnership. This resulted in Intel suing AMD for patent infringement, however the courts ruled in AMD\u2019s favour citing the previously mentioned case.\n\nAs the decade progressed, and the 2000s rolled around AMD came out with their own products, which handily beat Intel\u2019s own offerings, but the damage was already done. Intel was able to make so much money that they essentially had a monopoly on the CPU market.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nOld benchmark demonstrating AMD's advantage over Intel\n\nBut despite having the performance crown for about 7 years, their market share never came close to that of Intel, and the reason behind this would be revealed in 2009.\n\nIn 2009, the European commission fined Intel $USD 1.4b3. The reason behind this was Intel had bribed OEMs with cash incentives to not use AMD processors. This was to the point that Intel paid Dell 1b per year to not use AMD4. These bribes were so significant that when in 2006, in order not to be laughed out of business, they started to use AMD products, resulting in a massive 50% decrease in profit in 20065. That being said the damage was already done once again, and AMD was relegated to being a secondary competitor to Intel as they had simply run out of money. AMD released the Phenom in 2008, which was thoroughly crushed by the Intel competitors and after three years of refreshing the product with minor improvements, they released the horrible Bulldozer in 2011 which was legendary for its horrible performance, and insane power consumption. In 2016, they were near insolvency, with a share price bottoming out at 2$ per share.\n\nAll the while, Intel made small iterative performance upgrades while making all the money they could ever want. This is why your computer from 2010 is still very serviceable in 2020, 10 years later.\n\nIn 2017, AMD released their new Zen architecture with a massive 40%+ leap in IPC bringing it back into competition with Intel. Furthermore, Zen was an MCM design meaning that you could pair a few small chips to act as one large chip via Infinity Fabric, an interconnect that acted as the highways permitting multiple chips, or chiplets to communicate with each other.\n\n**Intel VS. AMD in the modern age**\n\nA lot has happened in the last 5 years. Currently, Intel\u2019s technology portfolio is a complete and utter disaster, rife with stagnation. For example, Intel\u2019s primary product, Intel\u2019s current offerings are a mere 7% better in applications that only use 1-2 cores, than those of AMD\u2019s while using 50% more energy and having vastly inferior in the increasingly important applications which leverage more than four cores. Intel\u2019s highest end desktop product, the w3175x, coming in at 3k only has 28 cores, whilst the highest end AMD cpu the 3990x, has over double at 64 cores. The performance disparity is clear, AMD is the only viable option for productivity. The story continues in servers where Intel is outclassed in a similar manner to that of the desktop with performance on the AMD side being well over 200% higher. The slaughter continues into laptops where AMD\u2019s 4900HS, completely embarrasses the highest end Intel competition while consuming \u2153 the power. The only performance crown that Intel can claim is gaming, and even then it is a mere 7% higher, due to extreme clock speeds with their newest architecture, when compared to AMD\u2019s design, which is over a year old.\n\nThere are multiple reasons why Intel is so behind in performance, the primary being nodes. Intel\u2019s 10 nm node was slated to launch four years ago. Four years is a very long time for any company, especially for the semiconductor space, and the sole reason why Intel was not severely punished for these stagnations was that they were miles ahead of any competitor. Earlier on I mentioned that AMD had fabs and was a secondary supplier, however as they were approaching insolvency, they sold off their fabs and partnered with Global Foundries, and later TSMC. However TSMC ramped the 7 nm, which was designed to compete with 10nm, extremely fast, handedly taking Intel\u2019s previous position as owning the most advanced fabs. Looking at Intel\u2019s road map, volume 10 nm will most likely hit the market by 2021, if there are no further delays, but TSMC is not sitting still, they are also innovating with the 5 nm, which was designed to compete with Intel\u2019s 7nm hitting markets in 2020. If Intel does not get 10 nm functioning by 2021, it will spell the end of Intel\u2019s fabs. TSMC will be not one, but two nodes ahead of Intel.\n\nThis is also compounded, though to a lesser extent by there being little to no IPC improvements in 5 years, meaning that AMD was free to catch up and in many cases surpass them.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin when it comes to Intel in the near term is their security vulnerabilities. Before 2018, all security vulnerabilities were mainly from software attacks, but that changed with the discovery of Meltdown and Specter. To show how important these issues were, let me illustrate an example. *Say you are a CEO of a major investment firm (lol), and you are using Intel servers to do whatever you need to do, you go about your day, the server is 100% secure from a software standpoint. Night comes, and you decide to look at how profitable your company was this quarter (again lol), but on the front page you see \u201cMajor leak at X company all confidential data was leaked,\u201d you panic and call up your IT guy and he is in a panic, the head lines are correct all company data stored on any server that you own has been leaked and there is nothing you can do about it.* That is the danger of these vulnerabilities. There is absolutely nothing you or your staff could have done, and worse yet, there are over a dozen similarly dangerous vulnerabilities, and over 600 more minor ones. The only way to try and prevent these leaks are to apply patches from Intel, but this results from anywhere between a 10% to a 60% loss in performance, which needs to be made up by buying new servers as you are already at 90-100% capacity. Then you hear that a certain company, AMD, was immune to this attack and their products are vastly superior. This is the major issue plaguing Intel at the moment. For the time being you will see a major rise in server sales as people scramble to buy up servers to remain operational, but in time they will switch to AMD, with AMD forecast to take 10% in Q2 20206, up from near 0% in 2016.\n\n**Intel VS. AMD in the near future**\n\nAt the moment AMD is uniquely positioned, their competition has yet to compete truely with their 1 year old tech, and they are on track to release brand new CPUs this year in late Q3/Q4. As a warning, we are entering grounds of speculation, but do note that this speculation is based on reliable leakers like AdoredTV7 (correctly leaked entire AMD CPU product stack from last year with only minor errors), Moore\u2019s Law is Dead8 (correctly leaked entire CPU product stack form Intel that was released this year with near 0 errors thus far).\n\nAMD: Intel  \n(New product titled Zen 3, releasing this year) (New product released this year)\n\n16 cores with 32 threads N/A\n\n12 cores with 24 threads 10 cores with 20 threads\n\n8 cores with 16 threads 8 cores with 16 threads\n\n6 cores with 12 threads 6 cores with 12 threads\n\nThings to remember\n\n\\- Zen 3 \\~13-15% IPC bump7, with maybe 100ish MHz clock speed bump7, which will allow AMD to claim the final performance crown of gaming from Intel, this coupled with Intel being nowhere in sight will allow AMD to reign supreme in all faculties for a while.\n\n**Final thoughts**\n\nAMD is in an excellent position to capitalize on Intel\u2019s stagnation. The security flaws could have not come at a better time, accelerating the world\u2019s adoption of AMD CPUs and their new products will beat Intel in gaming thanks to the IPC and clock speed increase improving their gaming performance by at least 15%. Overall, Intel is a precarious spot, that being said they have vast sums of cash and they had a few key developments in the past few years which could allow them to catch up in 2022 or 2023. I will discuss that possibility in a later post along with an analysis of how AMD will perform in the GPU market with consoles on their side.\n\n1.

        "selftext": "There seems to be a lot of misinformation around Electra Meccanica (SOLO)\u00a0 so I thought I would share my findings with the group.\n\nSOLO is based out of Vancouver, Canada, where I am from, and\u00a0 is co-founded by their COO/President Henry Reisner.\n\nHenry and his family started in the car Business in the 80s when they founded the company intermeccanica which created high quality Porsche speedster replicas. From my understanding Intermeccanica is still a separate company owned by the Reisner family but they are closely connected to SOLO.\u00a0\n\nThe replica Porsche company has been and still is extremely successful and the family has actually written a book about how they developed the company.\n\nI have actually met with Members of the Reisner family at the international Vancouver auto show where they had their SOLO vehicles on display. They are car people and mentioned how it was extremely important that car people would enjoy how their handles which makes sense with them being Porsche people.\n\nFrom what I understand they made a lot of money to start the company by selling electric versions of their porsche speedster which Bill gates is seen driving around in with Warren Buffet :o\n\nThe product that could potentially make this company\u2019s worth increase greatly is their 1 seater called the solo.\u00a0\n\nThe Single seater has been in small scale production in Asia already and they have a small fleet of those cars already built which can be seen in their Vancouver showroom.\u00a0\n\nAs many have heard their CEO is looking for a production plant in Arizona and other states and we have already seen what a fake press release of a new production plant can do.\n\nThe Largest risk to the company in the short term is IMO is the possibility of not securing a US production site as expected\n\nThe company also has value because to my understanding they are actually producing their own technology and electronics as they are scooping up Phd electrical engineers in the past few years and still are. Companies like rimac who have also developed tech like their received revenue by selling tech to larger car companies who need a fast way into electric cars which is a growing market.\n\nTLDR:\n\nPros:\n\n* Lots of preorders for single seater\u00a0\n* Established Electric Porsche speedster Line (w customers like bill gates and warren buffet )\n* Very likely to soon close on a production facility for Preorders\n* A press release of production facility will Bring us to the moon\n* Good proprietary technology\u00a0\n* Good Driving cars (They are actually car enthusiast not just a group of hippies)\n\nCons:\n\n* Possibility that they may fail to secure a production plant\u00a0\n* IN the long term when the Solo car comes out it may not be perceived well\n\nOverall I think this company is definitely a steal the short term as it should definitely at least reach it\u2019s pre covid levels of about $2.50 and  MUCH higher if they secure a production plant. This company Probably won't be the new tesla but I definitely think some good press about their cars once production starts could really push the company up to the moon\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nAlso if this gets on jay Lenos garage \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83c\udf19 \n(Had to have emojis in there)\n\nReferences:\n\nBuffet and Gates in car:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQWkNXr2ujI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQWkNXr2ujI)\n\nPre Orders:\n\n[https://electrameccanica.com/electra-meccanica-announces-vehicle-pre-orders-now-exceed-64000-units/](https://electrameccanica.com/electra-meccanica-announces-vehicle-pre-orders-now-exceed-64000-units/)\n\nProduction plans and car Info:\n\nhttps://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/\\_d6e0f90ec1740fc6d44522270bb3bc3f/electrameccanica/db/354/2669/pdf/SOLO+June+2020+Investor+Presentation.pdf\n\nInvestor site:\n\n[https://investors.electrameccanica.com](https://investors.electrameccanica.com/)",

        "selftext": "# Hey everyone, here is my take on SNAP (NYSE). Pls let me know your thoughts (supporting/ conflicting) etc. or if there's anything else I need to cover. This is just my opinion of the stock and I could definitely go into way more detail...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## \ud83d\udd25\u00a0Investment Thesis\n\n1. Snapchat has the potential to become the first Western Super App\n2. Snapchat is a bet on innovation, and that innovation wins in the end\n3. Snapchat is leading the way with augmented reality and is a long-term hardware play\n\n#### (1) Snapchat has the potential to become the first Western SuperApp\n\n* On June 11th, Snap announced **Minis**. These are micro applications that third-party devs build for people to use inside of Snapchat.  \n\n   * Snap is starting with 7 Minis with some big partners including Headspace (meditate with friends) and Coachella (coordinate your festival line-up with friends).\n* We can look at the success and misfortunes of other companies who have launched micro applications to see if this is a good move for Snap:  \n\n   * **Bull Case: Snapchat replicates** [**WeChat\u2019s success with Mini Programs**](https://melchers-china.com/wechat-mini-programs-a-rapidly-growing-trading-channel-in-china/)  \n\n      * Mini Programs launched on WeChat in 2017\n      * By August 2019, there were 2.36 million WeChat mini-programs\n      * In 2019, over 300 million people had spent a collective [$115B](http://routenote.com/blog/tencent-made-115-billion-just-from-wechats-mini-apps-in-2019/#:~:text=Tencent%20revealed%20the%20news%20that,expand%20the%20platform%20in%202020.) through WeChat Mini Programs\n      * Chinese research agency Kueclub and Tencent Research &amp; Development found 40% of 8000 research respondents believe they will completely replace standalone apps one day\n      * Since announcing WeChat Mini Programs in [December 2016](https://chinachannel.co/try-wechat-mini-programs-now/), Tencent (owner of WeChat) stock has increased over 130%\n   * **Bear Case: Snapchat follows the sad path of iMessage apps\u2026**  \n\n      * These are small apps that you can access through iMessage on iPhone\n      * Developers seemed to [lose interest](https://www.macrumors.com/2017/03/16/developer-imessage-apps-fading/) in 2017 after 6 months.\n      * Hasn\u2019t grown much beyond Sticker packs\u2026 and certainly nowhere near as big as WeChat Mini Programs\n* My Take:  \n\n   * **Evidence of Success:** Snap has killed it since opening its platform up to developers. Out of [800 apps integrated with Snapkit](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200611005151/en/Snap-Announces-New-Developer-Products-Partnerships-Snap), 20 are in the top 100 of the app store at the moment. Snap Games have also seen a successful start with over [100 million users](https://venturebeat.com/2020/06/11/snap-hits-100-million-players-teams-with-zynga-and-launches-more-chat-games/) since they launched last year. I expect similar success for Snap Minis, and ultimately for them to follow the path of WeChat.\n   * **Snap becomes stickier:** If Minis are successful, it\u2019ll make Snapchat very sticky. Why would people leave the Snap app when so many other convenient services are offered on it? Snap previously made their app sticky with Snap streaks, and now they\u2019re going to make it even more so with Snap minis.\n   * **Growth opportunities:** If everyone is using Snap Minis to plan, shop, and socially book tickets together, non-users will be persuaded to download Snapchat to access these programs specifically.\n   * **Revenue diversification:** Snapchat has a huge opportunity to diversify revenue beyond adverts and brand partnerships, by taking a cut of revenue spent through e-commerce Snap Minis (see above: $115BUSD spent through WeChat mini-programs in 2019).\n\n### (2) Snapchat is the most innovative social media company\n\n* This is pretty clear from all the news articles released about Facebook copying everything Snapchat does\n* Snapchat was [**FastCompany\u2019s most innovative company of 2020\u2026**](https://www.fastcompany.com/most-innovative-companies/2020) a list that also placed Tesla, Shopify, Beyond Meat, and Spotify in the top 15.\n* It\u2019s worth reading more about this [**here**](https://www.fastcompany.com/90457684/snap-most-innovative-companies-2020)\n\n### (3) Snapchat is leading the charge with Augmented Reality and is a long-term hardware play\n\n* **Leading the charge into Augmented Reality:**  \n\n   * According to Mordor Intelligence, the Augmented Reality market is expected to have a CAGR of [152%](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/augmented-reality-market) between 2019 and 2020, and the user base for AR technologies is also expected to grow beyond 1 billion by 2025.\n   * Researchandmarkets.com is more bearish, estimating the [size of the AR market](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200515005267/en/Global-Augmented-Reality-Mixed-Reality-Market-Growth) to only grow at 44.74% (still ridiculously high) to USD 27.44 billion by 2025, up from USD 2.98 billion in 2019.\n   * Snap is positioning itself to take a large proportion of the consumer-facing AR market.  \n\n      * More than [170 million](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-11/snap-says-170-million-use-its-augmented-reality-tools-daily) people use Snapchats Augmented Reality tools daily\n      * Snap recently announced an AR tool called Scan that allows people to digitally interact with anything they see with their iPhone camera  \n\n   * Snap was rated as the #1 most innovative VR/ AR company of 2020 by Fast Company, and if they can use this to capture a large proportion of the consumer AR market (27.44B in 2025 - see above), their revenue and valuation could be off the charts in the medium - long term.\n* **Long-term hardware play**  \n\n   * Following the iPhone and subsequent Android smartphone releases in the past decade, AR glasses have long-believed to be the next major hardware step in computing that will change the way we interact with the world\n   * Evan Spiegel (Snapchat CEO) believes we are unlikely to see mainstream AR glasses for another 10 years\n   * In an interview, Evan Spiegel stated  \n*\u201cSpectacles, because they\u2019re a new type of camera, they\u2019re still event-based in terms of usage. You go on a really cool trip, you\u2019re playing with your kids, whatever it is \u2014 and you want to represent that moment in a totally new way, from your perspective in 3D. So for now, I do think it\u2019s going to continue to be an event-based product.* ***But what\u2019s really exciting is that over time, we\u2019ve seen the capacity for these cameras to evolve from event-based products to products that are used all day long. So, I think we\u2019re just on that journey with Spectacles****. And we\u2019re fortunate that we can continue to invest along that path to get there.\u201d*  \n\n      * While open to interpretation, this could mean that Snapchat is investing in Snap Spectacles, with the aim they will eventually become AR glasses armed with Snapchats AR software to compete with [Apple\u2019s much-anticipated equivalent](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-glasses/).\n   * **EVEN MORE INTERESTING:** On top of Snap\u2019s augmented reality software capabilities, Snap has also announced\u00a0[voice-enabled](https://mashable.com/article/snapchat-voice-scan-lens-finder/)\u00a0lenses called Voice Scan. This is similar to Apple\u2019s Siri or Amazon\u2019s Alexa.  \n\n      * Voice could potentially be used as a control-mechanism for AR glasses later down the track\n   * **My Take:** AR glasses seem to me like an inevitability, however, whether or not Snapchat create them is a pretty huge speculation. However, the upside of this speculation could be **ridiculous**. Using the case of Apple and the iPhone as an example:  \n\n      * There are currently [728 million iPhones ](https://www.statista.com/statistics/755625/iphones-in-use-in-us-china-and-rest-of-the-world/)in use around the world\n      * When Apple announced the iPhone on the 9th of January 2017, its stock price was [$11.94](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/apple-stock-price-in-the-10-years-of-the-iphone-2017-6?r=US&amp;IR=T)USD. Since then it has appreciated over 2500% to $352.08USD. Apple\u2019s market cap was less than $80B when it announced the iPhone, today it is $1T.\n      * If AR achieves a similar reach, then the dominant AR hardware company could see similar success to this.\n\n## \ud83d\udc4eRisks\n\nNo investment is without risks.\n\n* Many people believe Superapps will [fail in the Western world](https://blog.prototypr.io/why-chinas-super-apps-will-never-succeed-in-the-us-64c686c8c5d6), so Snapchat Minis won\u2019t succeed in a big way.  \n\n   * Western world and Asia do have incredibly different internet ecosystems with China effectively jumping straight to mobile\n   * Snap has had recent success with its Snap Kit and Snap Games, however, only time will tell\n* Snapchat is dying and will be replaced by the next social network  \n\n   * Snap still reaches more 13-34-year-olds in the US than Facebook or Instagram. It also reaches more users in the US than TikTok and Twitter combined.\n   * Snapchat growth has significantly underperformed [Instagram](https://www.statista.com/chart/15034/worldwide-user-growth-of-instagram-and-snapchat/). However, it would be worth to look into where the growth comes from (age and country demographics).\n   * It is entirely possible that the next social network could be built on top of Snapchat ([Hoop](https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/hoop-snapchat-app/), [Wink](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/wink-make-new-snap-friends/id1482681335), [YOLO](https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/08/download-yolo-app/) are some of the fastest-growing consumer apps and are all heavily reliant on Snapchat)\n   * Snap isn\u2019t afraid to acquire the next social network, having previously acquired [Bitmoji](https://www.bitmoji.com/) and [Zenly](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.zenly.locator&amp;hl=en_AU)\n* Snapchat has Facebook copying everything they do  \n\n   * [Evan Spiegel doesn\u2019t seem too worried about this](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/evan-spiegel-says-facebook-copying-their-popular-features-is-the-most-fantastic-feeling-ever/articleshow/64379256.cms) so long as Snapchat remain innovative and ahead of the park  \n\n      * *\u201cIf you can create something that is so beautiful and simple that the only thing other people can do is copy it exactly, that is the most fantastic feeling. It is the most fantastic thing in the entire world.\u201d*\n* Snapchat won\u2019t become profitable  \n\n   * One of the biggest tests for Snap will be figuring out a monetization model beyond advertising. No one has cracked this outside of China yet, and Snap\u2019s messaging network of close friends makes it possibly the best positioned to do so.\n* Snap spectacles suck..  \n\n   * They do suck, but as mentioned above they could simply be a step in the process of getting to full AR glasses.\n* Snap is already huge ($23B company), it won\u2019t grow much more  \n\n   * Snap has the long-term potential to be the size of any of the top consumer tech companies. Apple $1.47T (51x Snap), Google $964B (33x), Facebook $653B (23x) and Netflix $184B (6x).\n* Before investing, make sure you read Snapchat\u2019s prospectus and yearly reports to see more risks.\n\n## Current valuation\n\n* Amongst the 35 analysts that cover Snap, the average target price is $18.66\n* At the current price, the consensus is Snapchat is marginally overvalued. However, with plenty of positive information being released at the Snap Partner Summit, this could change when analysts next update their ratings.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n* Worth digging deeper if you\u2019re a patient investor, looking to buy and hold for the long-term (minimum 5-10 years)\n* Could crash again like in 2018 if Snap fails to execute mini-apps etc. or if young generation has a fundamental shift to another social network\n* *Disclosure: I\u2019m long SNAP through underlying equity, but not that long\u2026 it represents a very small proportion of my overall portfolio.

A strangle is a good strategy if you think the underlying security will experience a large price movement in the near future but are unsure of the direction.

        "selftext": "First off, you do you. I have no agenda and could be totally wrong.\n\nThat said, I'm  concerned for small investors, so I'm just going to share some more observations and wisdom from 30+ years of investing in markets. If you love stocks here then go all in and do you - I have zero skin in this  game, having bought most of my stocks in 2010 and then again in March, and thus if anything I'm benefiting from this bubble. I got killed in the 2000 bubble, though, before I knew much, and see a lot of the same signs, so I want to prevent that for others. Please read the paragraph  after the 5 points below, because I actually give props to the mental  fortitude you guys are showing.\n\nReading through this sub the past few days, I have seen the following sentiments:\n\n1. Don't fight the FED -- and I agree, to a point of full valuation, which we're at on most stocks. Definitely on the major indexes.\n2. \"Brr\"  -- Implying that printing money lifts all assets. This is true to a  point, but if the \"positive effects\" of printing money lasted forever, we'd still have the Roman Empire, et al. In fact, this is exactly how empires decline. Also, you have to adjust any perceived \"gains\" for both capital gain and inflation. This winds up being a parabola where there are real gains to a point, they peak, then fade and you wind up with negative returns the longer you're in.\n3. \"I'm buying the best companies and for the long-term so I will be okay.\"  Again, some companies will have a benefit from what's going on, the recession, and win big in the recovery, so that's an accurate sentiment. But to buy them at any price is where the logic breaks down. By paying any price you assures no gains when adjusted for capital gains and inflation, and  there's even some time decay where the odds simply aren't on your side.\n4. \"Buy the dip\" - This has worked, and now 3% dips are being bought hand over fist as if they're 50% dips. There's a real crowding and FOMO mindset  that if you don't buy the dip you just miss the next rip. How this breaks? I'm not sure. It's Pavlovian at this point. I can see it  breaking via dollar weakness where gains buy nothing, the bubble growing  and big money putting on their shorts, or rate hikes (unlikely, but  possible), earnings collapse.\n5. \"I've heard these arguments. and they are Austrian. We are in a new economy.  If I had listened to this in 2010 I'd have missed out, etc\" - Some half  truths in there, and I wasn't here in 2010 warning people of anything. That was a great time to buy and I was doing so, would have recommended it, and I've made 100s of %s from buying in 2010. There are good buying  opportunities where reward outweighs risk and visa versa. I'm not  Austrian or Keynesian, having read pretty much every major book from  both camps, and the books in the middle. The bottom line is you have to ignore all that, and a good buy is a good buy, and visa versa. You  should look up the 10 and 15 year droughts (at least 4 major ones) in  stocks where they returned nothing/negative, because despite there being  great companies being bought, that didn't matter. The idea of liquidity being the only thing that matters, so you can buy high and sell higher is what's in vogue today, and all I can do is give a gentle admonition  that that never wins out in the long-run. There's a time decay on that  (think musical chairs when the song could be a 30 second jingle or an 8 minute Stairway to Heaven -- each has a time decay, but eventually even long songs end). It will win for a long time, and you will feel like a  genius, until it doesn't and you don't. Stocks \"climb a wall of worry\"  and \"take the elevator down\". Then it turns it's vicious, as you can see  on the charts below, which gets to my next point.\n\nI  actually think now that retail believes all of these things, we will see the bubble grow larger. Retail has been the final missing piece for an *epic* bubble. I also think it's interesting that the retail piling in is  young, and many of these people cut their teeth in digi-currency, so they have more stomach for volatility. This results in them holding longer and  harder than retail of the past. There is skepticism in any advice where  they view it as older people (I'm gen X and a tech guy, so not exactly  old) who want them out of stocks so they can buy them. So it will be harder for hedge funds/smart money to pry away their shares. This will  make the bubble harder to pop. Even today I see retail investors asking  one another on this site what they will be buying on today's dip. There  is no panic selling. Just calm, cool, and collected. How big institutions get those shares back is anyone's guess, but to me this  dynamic means the bubble lasts longer than anyone's expecting. It's also fascinating to watch.\n\nAll that said, it will end. Here are a few charts where people had all of the exact same beliefs and psychology that you do today.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/mZyWGKI](https://imgur.com/a/mZyWGKI)\n\n1. The Nasdaq bubble. It took *15 years* for people to regain their nominal gains. The idea that you're fine if you hold long term is challenged by this reality.\n2. Japan's Topix bubble. This bubble has never returned even its nominal games after 30 years now.\n3. China's Shanghi bubble -- We're on year 5, and still not close to any returns.\n\nAll of these are nominal, so when adjusted for inflation there have been zero returns and even negative returns.\n\nMy  feeling is this bubble lasts until at least markets make all time highs. The momentum is to that level, and for whatever reason the  overall market psychology is that of where it wants to break new highs.  This was confirmed by technicals such as moving average and retracement.  These are never guarantee, and maybe we see follow through and a  repricing downward moving forward, but that's not the trend or psychology.\n\nYou do you. Just  realize everyone participating in the 3 bubbles linked above felt the  exact same way you do. That's the main point I am trying to stress -- a  bubble takes on a psychology of it's own, becomes self reinforcing, etc.  Good luck.",

Period.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The PE of SPX is back at dot.com levels](https://preview.redd.it/3aqc6jy0pu651.png?width=2028&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d34d0c03f70078aa407f465303b2f3cb04dbb3e5)\n\nEven abstracting from earnings, using Market Cap / GDP you\u2019d conclude that the market looks \u201ca tad\u201d expensive...even more expensive than January 2000..\n\nThat is especially true if we\u2019re really witnessing a secular trend of diminishing globalisation - because then the argument \u201c*But S&amp;P companies are global, they should be compared to World GDP*\u201d becomes weaker.\n\n[Tobin\u2019s Q - Market Capitalization vs GDP](https://preview.redd.it/09o0kxj2pu651.png?width=1758&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05e142d6f93f86f5ae81c484f009f097f214685d)\n\n**...is not really expensive considering QE**\n\nHowever, there are other ways to look at valuations. Considering that the main mechanism for QE transmission is via the bond market, it might make sense to compare equity valuations relative to bond yields. This changes the perspective completely and dramatically.\n\nThe chart below shows a classic proxy of the equity risk premium for S&amp;P 500, calculated by subtracting the 10y bond yield from the earnings\u2019 yield of the equity index - as a reminder, high means cheap in this case.\n\nThe chart shows that **compared to bonds, S&amp;P 500 has seldom been cheaper**. As asset allocators consider their options, QE is twisting their arm to go heavier into equities.\n\n[A proxy of the forward Equity Risk Premium for SPX](https://preview.redd.it/3t3881y3pu651.png?width=2039&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7a3a4109c5cc20717abaf4a8e810a0cb064456b)\n\n**Massive short positioning in the market**\n\nThe other factor propelling the market higher is that everybody is short. If this feels counterintuitive, think about the fact that if speculative positions are very short it means that short sellers **have already sold** \\- and therefore their selling pressure is abating and **they might be forced to buy back their shorts** as the market works out this painful short squeeze.\n\n[SPX Net Positioning at historical lows](https://preview.redd.it/2hgzlye5pu651.png?width=2040&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4a491844d86861a6c9b0a56eb0b81c5e351ae91)\n\n**Economic damage is still there**\n\nIt is quite common for markets to retrace after a &gt;3 standard deviation events. This happens during bull markets and recessionary periods.\n\nThe deciding factor between these two world views will, inevitably, boil back to fundamentals. One lost quarter to the global economy will mean defaults and unemployment, dampening both demand and investments\n\n[ISM New orders as deep as during the 2008 crisis](https://preview.redd.it/q723nus6pu651.png?width=2038&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6dd7c67e2d48c360cb49121b935a0a30cd9139a3)\n\n**Conclusions - factors to track relevant if you stay long (or go short)**\n\nTo stay long in the market, we\u2019ll want to monitor three factors (and the reverse applies for going short):\n\n1. **A recovery in macro data proxied by the ISM New Orders**\n2. **No sudden drop in volatilities, signaling complancency**\n3. **No excessive long futures positioning**\n\nMarkets might stay irrational for longer than traders can stay solvent, as the old adage says... or in the words of Jim Cramer:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2oi6fz88pu651.png?width=1674&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a4bcb9bbdc15c64dce1a3cd9b834ae9ef190727\n\n**What nobody is talking about**\n\nMeanwhile, the popularity of one of the most pro-market Presidents in history is falling in the middle of riots and pandemics. November is very far away and like many others we consider the re-election of Trump a fait-accompli\u2019 ... yet if the numbers keep diverging markets might begin to become nervous about it.\n\n[Source FiveThirtyEight](https://preview.redd.it/0gyt14h9pu651.png?width=1563&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fb7ab76fb67a4f955eedb2a6526197727437d1c)",

        "selftext": "*TL/DR: I'm bearish because of the looming unemployment, the market is already overbought, the fed can't fix every part of the economy, and because of the political and social unrest this year already has and will continue to bring. Would love to hear and discuss counter arguments.*\n\nI've been hearing countless arguments, first from the bears that COVID was undoubtedly the start of the next Great Depression, then from the bulls that were laughing at the bears because J Powell cancelled the recession and the V shape recovery is looking pretty good.  So here we are, 3 months later and the market is heading back toward the all time highs of February.\n\nI can understand a lot of the bulls argument and the \"don't fight the fed\" mentality. Right now, there really isn't a better place to stash your money than stocks. However, if we really sit down and think about what has already happened and what is on the way for the rest of this year, I truly can't see this momentum going through 2020 and into 2021. I still have some individual positions that I will continue to hold, but I am considering putting a lot of money into an inverse S&amp;P500 ETF (SH, SDS, SPXU) and watching as the next year unfolds. My bear argument for the next year:  \n***1)*** ***Unemployment:*** Unemployment is currently sitting at 40 million Americans. Recent study from the University of Chicago ([here](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/20/most-americans-see-layoffs-as-temporary-but-research-shows-otherwise.html)) says that 42% of those people won't have jobs to come back to. Even being conservative on the study and assuming 25%...that is 6 million people permanently unemployed. \n\nEvery company and industry has had to learn to adapt to at home work for the last 3 months, and that's going to cause a lot of companies to take a look at what jobs are really necessary to function and likely leave lower skilled Americans without jobs.\n\n***2) Market was already overbought before COVID and still is:*** Pretty straightforward on this one, coming into 2020 the market was already seriously overbought after the 11 year bull run and was due for a correction. It got a massive correction, but now is right back into overbought territory. PE is 23 and Shiller PE is 28.73 (median is 15.78)...a correction at these levels seems likely even without COVID. Low interest rates have made stocks the only game in town which is why they are being flooded into, but that does not make a lot of these companies well-run businesses worthy of their current valuation. Balance sheets and cash flows matter, and eventually investors are going to expect to see earnings, and a lot of these high flying \"COVID stocks\" won't be able to provide them.\n\n  \n***3)*** ***\"Unlimited\" QE can only do so much:*** I know, don't fight the fed. The fed can print money, but it can't create demand and jobs. If my case about unemployment and overbought markets are even halfway true, the feds printing is only a band-aid that will eventually have to be taken off.\n\nWe also don't really have a great idea of what \"unlimited QE\" even really means or looks like. Does it mean infinite from a dollars scale and/or a time scale? Does this unlimited QE only apply to what the fed considers COVID related issues, or will they just have to keep printing like this in 5 years or 10 years for any decline? Essentially I feel like the market is being completely propped up by the Fed, but that printing cash doesn't actually generate demand and *genuine* cash flows for a company\n\n  \n***4) Political and Social Unrest:*** This is the one that everyone knows about and almost jokes about at this point. Another set of bad news and the market roars higher. How sustainable is it really?\n\nI believe that COVID alone was enough to drag down the market substantially...but we have so much more going on than just COVID. \n\nWe have a President of the #1 economy who blames COVID directly on the #2 economy in the world...which will almost guarantee there is no trade deal happening with China anytime soon. With COVID, Hong Kong, and Trump, the situation with China will only deteriorate as the years go on. \n\nWe have an election year with arguably the most controversial president of all time who is going to use all means necessary to win or defraud the election. Either Trump wins another 4 years and we trust him to rebuild us in a post-COVID world, or he loses and very likely creates what will certainly be a democratic crisis. How many people truly see him going away peacefully? All we need is a couple of close states and \"fake news, election fraud\" are all over his Twitter and Fox News and we have a genuine crisis on our hands. Can't imagine this November-January being pretty in either scenario.\n\nSocial unrest is here to stay. People are furious right now and the cities aren't just burning because of one thing (although police brutality toward African Americans is a MAJOR issue) but because of YEARS of mistreatment and a system that does not work. The system is rigged against those in the bottom, the wealth gap has been growing for years, and I feel that these protests, pushed further by Trump, is society's way of showing that this just isn't sustainable. The masses at the bottom are demanding a true change. I'm not sure if they're going to get it or not, but I'm pretty confident they won't between now and November.\n\nSo...all that being said...I'm shorting the market using inverse ETFs. Who agrees?",

After this report was released, Huawei attempted to obfuscate it's dealings with Skycom leading to another detailed report being released in March of 2013.  (The [2012 report](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-huawei-hp/exclusive-huawei-partner-offered-embargoed-hp-gear-to-iran-idUSBRE8BT0BF20121230) / [2013 report](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-huawei-skycom/exclusive-huawei-cfo-linked-to-firm-that-offered-hp-gear-to-iran-idUKBRE90U0CA20130131) respectively). \n\nIn response to the Reuters articles released in 2012 and 2013, several banks questioned Huawei about its relationship with Skycom. This included HSBC, where both Huawei and Skycom held bank accounts.\n\nIn the U.S. indictment, specifically, Meng is being charged for participating in fraud involving HSBC. But this was a point of contention since the representations she made weren't technically criminal under Canadian law, i.e. no sanctions. What was criminal, however, and what ultimately led to Meng being charged is the actual act of making fraudulent misrepresentations, which is criminal in both the U.S. and Canada as well. ([The full 36 page Supreme Court ruling if you're interested in reading](https://www.scribd.com/document/463254844/2020-BCSC-785-United-States-v-Meng))\n\n**Expected Outcomes**\n\nMoving forward, I think the primary question we have to consider now, is what exactly is going to happen once Meng is extradited to the United States. Were it any other case, this would be a pretty clear cut white collar fraud cause. Of course, this isn't just any case, and the context of the trade tensions between the U.S. and China as well as ongoing geopolitical issues like with the Hong Kong protests, all have to be taken into account.",

        "selftext": "# Oh Snap!\n\n\ud83c\udfa7\u00a0*If you prefer listening to reading, you can listen here:* [*Oh Snap! (Audio Edition)*](https://notboring.substack.com/p/oh-snap-audio-edition)\n\nIn 2012, I invested in Facebook at around $19 per share. In 2013, I sold it for $45. I thought I was a genius. Since then, though, Facebook is up another 5x - I missed out on most of the gains. Back then, people were unconvinced that Facebook could do mobile well. Once they did mobile well, people doubted that they could increase the ad load in the mobile News Feed in order to sustain growth. Wrong again. Facebook has built one of the two best advertising businesses in human history.\n\nWhat I learned: when you think you\u2019ve found the next big platform, don\u2019t worry about the little things. Invest in it, don\u2019t trade it.\u00a0\n\nOver the next five years, Snap has the potential to be as big as today\u2019s biggest tech companies. Becoming the next platform is a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and I think Snap is best positioned to be that platform.\n\nThe stakes are high. The chart below shows the market caps of today\u2019s biggest consumer(ish) tech companies, which provides a rough estimate of the upside in Snap if it\u2019s able to take advantage of the opportunity ahead of it.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xz6pncz553551.png?width=3388&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e4d794f9ec92850bc4be48ced683093b3063199\n\nSnap has had a rough go of it as a public company, and most of us kind of forgot about it. I\u2019m putting everyone back on alert.\u00a0\n\nI haven\u2019t been as excited about a company as I am about Snap in a long time. It checks some major nerd boxes for me:\u00a0\n\n\u2705 **Hype Cycles**: We are catching Snap at the right time, as it\u2019s heading up the Slope of Enlightenment. Others will slowly begin to wake up to Snap\u2019s potential, you heard it here first.\n\n\u2705 **Worldbuilding:** Spiegel and Snap are patiently laddering towards a long-term vision so big that most people missed it.\n\n\u2705 **Mirrorworld:** Snap is building the next major platform - Augmented Reality. Aside from being a lot of fun, AR presents an internet-scale financial opportunity.\n\nWhile most of us were distracted, Evan Spiegel built a new world. Today, Snap is weaving together a complex and defensible suite of products, technology, content, and SDKs that position it to build the next big platform - the one that blends the physical and digital worlds.\u00a0\n\nIf you, like me, missed it, don\u2019t worry. We\u2019re not alone. Scott Galloway declared \u201c[The End of Snap](https://medium.com/s/no-mercy-no-malice/no-mercy-no-malice-the-end-of-snap-tesla-af4499558ce0)\u201d in October 2018. Ben Thompson hasn\u2019t written seriously about the company since [last July](https://stratechery.com/?s=snap), after writing about it almost monthly between 2015 and 2019. There\u2019s a good reason, too.\u00a0\n\n### The Hype Cycle\n\nI want to take you back to a time when the only app on our Nokia phone was Snake, when Britney Spears\u2019 *...Baby One More Time* was #1 on the charts, and one of my all-time favorite movies was released. That movie, *She\u2019s All That,* has a lot in common with Snapchat.\n\nIn case you haven\u2019t watched *She\u2019s All That* recently, I\u2019ll give you a quick rundown.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nZack (Freddie Prinze Jr.) starts the movie as the most popular guy in school, but falls from grace when his girlfriend breaks up with him. In an effort to gain back popularity, he accepts a bet with his best friend Dean: that he can turn Laney Boggs, a dorky art student, into the Prom Queen. Against all odds, and after a persistent effort, Zack and Laney start to like each other, and it looks like Zack might win the bet *and* the girl. But then Dean (*traitor!*) reveals that Zack only asked her to win a bet.\u00a0\n\nZack and Laney break up. They\u2019re both at a new low. Zack takes his sister to prom, and Laney\u2019s planning on skipping altogether until Dean shows up and takes her. Laney loses the Prom Queen crown to Zack\u2019s ex, Taylor, and goes home, where\u2026 ZACK IS WAITING FOR HER!!\u00a0\n\nThey fall in love again by the pool. They kiss. It\u2019s one of the most romantic scenes in cinematic history.\u00a0([You can watch it here](https://youtu.be/GdrDuVImE2c))\n\nAt graduation, we are left with the impression that the best days are ahead for Zack and Laney. And we cry happy tears, and those tears come back any time we hear [Sixpence None the Richer\u2019s \u201cKiss Me\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8N-qO3sPMjc). (Wait, just me? Embarrassing.)\n\nZack and Laney\u2019s journeys look something like this:\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/joi5rv5b53551.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd4287bfb77ae0f23994c3ab5c1216cc68f3768f\n\nCool, so we\u2019ve established that I love *She\u2019s All That*. What does any of this have to do with Snap?\u00a0\n\nWell, hidden beneath those screen grabs is a chart that will be familiar to you if you\u2019ve been reading Not Boring for a while: the Gartner Hype Cycle. According to Gartner itself:\u00a0\n\n&gt;*Gartner Hype Cycles provide a graphic representation of the maturity and adoption of technologies and applications, and how they are potentially relevant to solving real business problems and exploiting new opportunities.*\u00a0\n\nMore simply, Gartner Hype Cycles describe the fact that many technologies, industries, and products come out of the gate hot with an initial use case, get really popular for a little while, then fade as that initial use case fails to live up to the hype. At that point, some products just die - countless flash-in-the-pan apps fall into this category - while others find real practical applications and rise from the ashes to provide ongoing value.\u00a0\n\n**Rocketship to the Peak**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0j6goe7c53551.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d3936e7944084e97e5eefe1085c2c02afbacc7e\n\nSnap certainly fit the left side of the chart. Triggered by cameras on every phone and ephemeral messaging (hence the Ghost logo), Snap shot up to the Peak of Inflated Expectations quickly. Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown ([we don\u2019t talk about him](https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/02/snapchat-reggie-brown/)) launched Snapchat as \u201cPictaboo\u201d in July 2011. By October 2012, Snapchat users were sharing 20 million images per day. By November 2013, two-year-old Snapchat had users sharing 350 million photos per day, and Spiegel reportedly turned down a $3 billion acquisition offer from Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook.\u00a0\n\nSnapchat was a rocketship, even if, or because, it was viewed as just a [sexting app](https://techcrunch.com/2012/05/12/snapchat-not-sexting/). This whole [timeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Snapchat) is worth checking out, but suffice it to say, Snapchat grew spectacularly from its 2011 founding through its March 2, 2017 IPO. Its stock closed at $27.09 the next day, good for a $39 billion market cap. Turns out, though, that three years later, $27.09 is still SNAP\u2019s all-time high.\u00a0\n\n**Elevator Down to the Trough**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/69bwws5d53551.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f84103b592ced1ba560bcf8c1218d81a3e62976d\n\nI remember the SNAP IPO distinctly, because I remember all of our parents asking whether they should buy SNAP. We thought it was way overvalued for a photo messaging app, and it turns out, the market agreed. SNAP\u2019s stock price tumbled 81% from its March 2017 high of $27.09 to an all time low of $4.99 on December 21, 2018. In September 2018, [Recode cited four reasons](https://www.vox.com/2018/9/16/17861692/snap-stock-decline-explained-user-growth-evan-spiegel) for the fall:\u00a0\n\n1. **Slowing Business Growth:** Snap was slow to bring advertisers onto the platform, causing analysts to cut their revenue estimates by 50%.\u00a0\n2. **Increased Competition:** Instagram Stories copied Snapchat, and used Facebook\u2019s distribution to eclipse Snapchat\u2019s Daily Active Users (DAUs).\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uu9jzs2e53551.png?width=764&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc6879855aa2d1f49ee264c8cc5eab80f8d94edb\n\n3. **Losing Users.** Snap redesigned its app in early 2018, pissing off important users. Kylie Jenner\u2019s tweet about the redesign caused SNAP\u2019s market cap to drop $1.3 billion in a day, and Snapchat lost 3 million DAUs in Q2 2018.\n\n[https://twitter.com/KylieJenner/status/966429897118728192?s=20](https://twitter.com/KylieJenner/status/966429897118728192?s=20)\n\n4. **Executive Departures.** Between the IPO and the Recode article, Snap lost its CFO, CSO, VP of Product, VP of Sales, VP of Engineering, and General Counsel. Those executives\u2019 compensation was heavily based on the sagging stock price.\n\nThis is right around the time that Galloway called \u201c[The End of Snap](https://medium.com/s/no-mercy-no-malice/no-mercy-no-malice-the-end-of-snap-tesla-af4499558ce0)\u201d and that Thompson stopped writing quite so frequently about the company (I count 10 articles in 2017, 6 in 2018, 4 in 2019, and 0 in 2020). I\u2019m guilty here too. I\u2019ve written about all of Snap\u2019s contemporaries, but I haven\u2019t talked about Snap. I didn\u2019t hear a lot about Snap and I wasn\u2019t receiving snaps, so I kind of forgot about it. Even when I asked people who have opinions on every company for their opinions on Snap for this piece, I got a lot of, \u201cI don\u2019t knows\u201d and \u201cI haven\u2019t thought much about Snap.\u201d\u00a0\n\nWhat I missed, though, is that I didn\u2019t hear about Snap as much as competitors like TikTok *by design*. TikTok is the greatest virality engine ever built; Snap doesn\u2019t want to go viral. I just tried to Snap something and share it broadly, and I couldn\u2019t figure out how to do it. So while us olds sleep on Snap from the outside, millions of younger best friends spend their entire lives communicating in there. We all underestimated Evan.\u00a0\n\n**Underestimating Evan**\n\nHitting the Trough of Disillusionment is the make or break moment for a company. From down there, the journey up the Slope of Enlightenment is far from guaranteed. Most once-buzzy social companies don\u2019t make it out the other side. RIP Yo, Yik Yak, and Whisper.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u4dhiphi53551.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88329d208be21637e7f2dfa59977306805fba581\n\nGalloway, and many others, predicted that Snap would go the way of Yo, Path, and Myspace. If it was lucky, maybe Disney or Amazon would buy it.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: I think what defines whether a company makes it through the Trough of Disillusionment or not is whether there\u2019s a Worldbuilder or a Shotcaller at the helm.\u00a0\n\nThe companies that fail after the initial hype were Shotcallers: they only had one product in mind and they ran at it hard, backed by big venture dollars. The Yo guys really thought that sending \u201cYo\u201d to each other was the future, communication in its simplest form. When that didn\u2019t work, there was no backup plan.\u00a0\n\nEvan Spiegel didn\u2019t even cross my mind when I was writing [*Two Ways to Predict the Future*](https://notboring.substack.com/p/two-ways-to-predict-the-future), but he really should have. **Evan Spiegel is a Worldbuilder.**\u00a0\n\nIn *Two Ways to Predict the Future*, I wrote that Worldbuilders have three things in common:\u00a0\n\n1. They predict something non-obvious about the way the world is moving before others see it and before the market is ready for their ultimate vision.  \n\n\n* For Spiegel, this was that the camera was going to be the way we all communicate and interact with the world.\n\n1. They create a wedge into the market and leverage it into a much larger opportunity. The public often ridicules or dismisses the initial wedge product.\u00a0  \n\n\n* This one\u2019s too easy. Everyone dismissed Snapchat as a sexting app.\n\n1. They timestamp their vision, whether in public announcements or confidential documents.\u00a0  \n\n\n* This [2018 company-wide memo](https://cheddar.com/media/snap-ceo-evan-spiegel-company-memo-on-2019-strategic-goals-and-profitability) from Spiegel clearly lays out (parts of) the plan, and this tweet from former Snapchat employee Lucy Guo shows that Spiegel has been working on recently-announced Snap Minis for at least four years.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7[**Lucy Guo** @lucy\\_guo@dtrinh Seeing Evan execute his plans 4 years later is heartwarming. I remember when I first heard him brainstorming this and thought \u201cWow, this guy really is a product visionary\u201d](https://twitter.com/lucy_guo/status/1271593254098579457?s=20)\n\n[June 13th 2020](https://twitter.com/lucy_guo/status/1271593254098579457?s=20)\n\n[**28** Likes](https://twitter.com/lucy_guo/status/1271593254098579457?s=20)\n\nWorldbuilders are rare. Bezos, Musk, Carta\u2019s Henry Ward. When you find one, you bet on them. I\u2019m a little late to the party, but not *too* late. Snap is right at the beginning of the climb up the Slope of Enlightenment.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x0futf4k53551.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c83516790b71840e319babfa6eae08a86b34b61\n\nI\u2019m now convinced that when its journey is complete, it will be one of the biggest, most important companies in history.\u00a0\n\n### So What is Snap Building?\n\nIf you\u2019re a Worldbuilder, one of the advantages of being in the Trough of Disillusionment is that it gives you time out of the spotlight to build your world. Over the past year or so, as measured by [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2011-01-01%202020-06-12&amp;geo=US&amp;q=snapchat), Snap had less public interest than it has since early 2015.\u00a0\n\nOver the past two months, though, the new Snap emerged, with two big events driving renewed interest in the company:\u00a0\n\n1. Gangbuster Q1 [earnings](https://investor.snap.com/news-releases/2020/04-21-2020-210949737) and user growth that sent shares up 37% in one day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/seh9ed1l53551.png?width=739&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=571d6cc6e2397a7e195312fd318e83b6f9c5a30b\n\n2. Thursday\u2019s Partner Summit 2020, *in Augmented Reality (AR)*, renewed excitement and convinced me that Snap is the leading contender to make AR real.\n\n[https://youtu.be/BfvubHha69k](https://youtu.be/BfvubHha69k)\n\nLast week, in [*Business is the New Sports*](https://notboring.substack.com/p/business-is-the-new-sports), I wrote about the power of keynotes and product launches in rallying fans around a brand, using Steve Jobs and Elon Musk as the canonical examples. Evan Spiegel and Snap took the torch on Thursday.\n\n[Turner Novak](https://twitter.com/TurnerNovak), who has understood Snap better than anyone [for](https://turner.substack.com/p/a-deep-dive-on-snaps-content-business) [a](https://turner.substack.com/p/how-the-snapchat-redesign-could-affect) [long](https://twitter.com/TurnerNovak/status/1092852491178442754?s=20) [time](https://twitter.com/TurnerNovak/status/1048790251601313793?s=20), wrote a [thorough summary of the event](https://turner.substack.com/p/snap-partner-summit-2020-recap-and), which you should check out, in addition to just watching.\n\nWatching the Summit unfold, I felt like Charlie in *It\u2019s Always Sunny.*\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3a5ygq9n53551.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b75399aecffa834383dbf99969e0f5043741c003\n\nBefore watching the Summit, I thought of Snap as a social media company, a competitor to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, and the rest. It\u2019s not though. Snap isn\u2019t just building a camera-first messaging app; it\u2019s building the platform of the future. It\u2019s building mirrorworld.\u00a0\n\n**Welcome to Mirrorworld**\n\nIn February 2019, Kevin Kelly wrote one of the most thought-provoking essays I\u2019ve read: [*AR Will Spark the Next Big Technology Platform -- Call it Mirrorworld*](https://www.wired.com/story/mirrorworld-ar-next-big-tech-platform/). In it, Kelly describes a digital world mapped 1:1 with the physical world, which we can interact with, experience, and manipulate just like the real world. Mirrorworld, according to Kelly, won\u2019t take place in Virtual Reality (VR), but rather in Augmented Reality (AR). It will blend digital and physical, layering bits\u2019 infinite possibilities on top of atoms\u2019 *realness*.\u00a0\n\nMirrorworld means being able to reproduce that [Travis Scott Fortnite concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYeFAlVC8qU) in a park instead of our basement, with real people, whenever we want, or looking at a restaurant from the street and being able to see the menu and pictures of the dishes. It means having a full suite of digital tools available to enhance our physical experience.\u00a0\n\nIt also means a big business opportunity. The first platform of the digital age was the web. The second was social media. The third, according to Kelly, will be mirrorworld.\u00a0\n\n&gt;*We are now at the dawn of the third platform, which will digitize the rest of the world.* ***Whoever dominates this grand third platform will become among the wealthiest and most powerful people and companies in history****, just as those who now dominate the first two platforms have. Also, like its predecessors, this new platform will unleash the prosperity of thousands more companies in its ecosystem, and a million new ideas\u2014and problems\u2014that weren\u2019t possible before machines could read the world.*\u00a0\n\nKelly points to Microsoft (Hololens) and Magic Leap ([uh oh](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-11/augmented-reality-startup-magic-leap-is-said-to-explore-a-sale)) as the two leading contenders to build mirrorworld.\u00a0\n\nHe doesn\u2019t mention Snap once. But watch this video. What does it make you think of?\u00a0\n\n[https://youtu.be/4jA1RM5\\_WMc](https://youtu.be/4jA1RM5_WMc)\n\nWatching that clip gave me chills. Qi Pan, the Snap Computer Vision Engineer narrating the video, says about Local Lenses:\u00a0\n\n&gt;*Now, Snapchatters can join a persistent, shared AR world built right on top of the physical one. You and your friends can step into these worlds together, collaborating creatively and experiencing a whole new dimension of AR.*\n\nThey\u2019re building fucking mirrorworld!\u00a0\n\n**Snap\u2019s Ladder to Mirrorworld**\n\nWhen I said that Evan Spiegel was a Worldbuilder, I meant it literally. And when you think of Snap as the company that\u2019s building mirrorworld, everything starts to \\*snap\\* into focus.\u00a0\n\nBack in March 2016, when Ben Thompson still wrote about Snapchat, he wrote [Snapchat\u2019s Ladder](https://stratechery.com/2016/snapchats-ladder/). In it, he compared Snapchat to Netflix, in that both were executing \u201cladder-up\u201d strategies: a series of moves that build off of each other with the end goal in mind from the beginning. It\u2019s like a Worldbuilder starting with an unassuming wedge and trading up en route to the ultimate goal.\u00a0\n\nFor Snap, to Thompson, that means starting with Snaps, then building Stories, then Discover, then Feeds and Optionality. The ladder he described built up to \u201cowning messaging in the United States.\u201d\u00a0\n\nWhat Thompson didn\u2019t grasp - nor could anyone outside the company - is that those three rungs were just the first three rungs on a ladder dozens of rungs high. At the top of the ladder, high above \u201cowning messaging in the United States,\u201d is mirrorworld, with Snap as the platform powering it all.\u00a0\n\nTo climb the ladder, Snap is employing the Amazon \u201cFirst and Best Customer\u201d strategy. It builds products for its own app first - like Lenses, its first AR hit - and then opens up the tools to both its community to create within Snapchat, and third-party developers to incorporate Snapchat\u2019s features into third-party apps.\n\nSnap is building a wide-ranging set of products that build off of each other and work together to lead to a future in which Snap powers the mirrorworld. It\u2019s big and complex, so let\u2019s start small. Bitmoji gives a glimpse into Snap\u2019s foresight.\u00a0\n\n**Bitmoji - Those Are Those Stickers That Kinda Look Like Me, Right?**\n\nSnap [acquired Bitstrips](https://www.wsj.com/articles/snapchat-buys-bitmoji-app-for-more-than-100-million-1458876017), the creators of Bitmoji, in March 2016. Thompson thought it was smart because Snap might be able to monetize Bitmoji by selling stickers to Snapchatters and selling companies the ability to create branded stickers. Snap\u2019s plans were much bigger. Now, Bitmoji is a key part of Snapchat\u2019s Chat, Snap Games, Snap Map, and Weather products.\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s how the \u201cfirst and best customer\u201d strategy works at Snap: first, they build for Snapchat, then they open up to 3rd party. Product, then platform. It\u2019s a flywheel.\u00a0\n\nFirst, Snapchat made it really easy to send Bitmoji through the app, pulling new users into the product and retaining existing ones. The first time I used Snapchat was to create my Bitmoji. Now, through [Bitmoji Kit](https://kit.snapchat.com/bitmoji-kit), Bitmoji is available in 3rd-party Android and iOS keyboards, *giving Snapchat reach into nearly every smart mobile device on the planet*.\u00a0\n\nSimilarly, Snap first used Bitmoji in Snap Games, and has now opened up Bitmoji to be used by 3rd party game developers, giving Snapchat a presence in games far beyond the ghost icon.\u00a0This map shows Bitmoji\u2019s reach within Snap and in 3rd party products.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dvn3pl4r53551.png?width=1415&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=311da4c52804c2e5e07486e5798ee2a5e928d235\n\nSnap even built its recently announced Minis - little apps built right into its Chat - on top of its game infrastructure. It\u2019s not difficult to imagine Minis one day being available in all of the keyboards where Bitmoji currently live.\u00a0\n\nBitmoji is Snap\u2019s friendly tentacle into a universe of 3rd party apps and a testing ground for mirrorworld. And that\u2019s *just Bitmoji.* Until like three minutes ago, most of you thought they were just silly cartoons.\n\n**The Camera Company**\n\nSnap\u2019s Camera is an even more powerful platform than Bitmoji, and the main one on top of which they\u2019ll build the mirrorworld. The evolution of Snapchat\u2019s Camera is deserving of an essay in itself, but if you strip away a lot of the complexity (and brilliance) it can be expressed as a ladder.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hlqu5u2s53551.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10b69bcfcc415853e8e1d991c05257b472465f3f\n\nFrom humble beginnings as a camera that may or may not have been used primarily to send dick pics, Snap has built one of the most broadly distributed pieces of AR technology in the world. In some ways, mirrorworld is already here: over 135 million people create AR with Snap every day. And with the announcement of Camera Kit, which allows 3rd party developers to integrate Snap\u2019s Camera into their apps - transitioning the Camera from a product to a platform - that number will rise.\u00a0\n\nCombined with the announcement of Local Lenses, soon millions of people in hundreds of apps will be able to digitally transform the physical neighborhoods in which they live and the way they appear in them.\n\nInstead of Shotcalling - building out the full suite of hardware and software and pushing it onto users - Snap is building the platform on which Snap, its users, and partners will build the mirrorworld together.\u00a0\n\n**And Snap Has the Right Users for a New Platform**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kopf88zs53551.png?width=791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbbe0a47d96170a7f9824a95016a83367c080cdf\n\nSnap has a big, engaged base of users who are the right age to pioneer a new technology platform. It\u2019s in the sweet spot - it has been around long enough to have a large user base, which is necessary to create enough adoption for a new platform, while its users are young enough (and geographically dense enough) to adopt a new spatial platform.\u00a0\n\nTo that end, two stats from the Partner Summit blew my mind:\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dcpfj7st53551.png?width=1137&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5ed6eaea1755517f0d9a30d9e2d84a2ba0b0324\n\nBecause Snap is not designed for virality, it\u2019s really difficult for an outsider to realize just how big it is with this key demographic. On a [September 2019 ](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/talks-at-gs/evan-spiegel.html)[*Talks at GS*](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/talks-at-gs/evan-spiegel.html)[ podcast](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/talks-at-gs/evan-spiegel.html), Spiegel highlighted his user growth strategy: don\u2019t worry too much about attracting older users, just **keep its users engaged while they get older and continue to attract new young users**. Despite the pressure on him to grow DAUs - which he could do by making the product friendlier to older and/or international users - Spiegel realized something magical that Matthew McConaughey\u2019s character in *Dazed and Confused* summarized so succinctly (and creepily):\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tvu5bfmu53551.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e492dc9f946c1ff0819efa6c068dbc412ecd519\n\nBoomers and even older Millennials won\u2019t be the early adopters of a transformative new platform. Just as my Pop Pop wasn\u2019t among the first people to adopt the internet, and my mom wasn\u2019t one of the first people on social media, I won\u2019t be one of the first people in mirrorworld. Snapchat owns the people who will be: young Americans.\u00a0\n\nBecause its users are Gen Z and younger Millennials who appreciate Snap\u2019s values, it can say and do the right things now and build long-term trust with them. Spiegel kicked off the Partner Summit with words of support for the protestors, and his team introduced four new docuseries featuring a black cowboy, the world\u2019s most popular fighter, a transgender hair stylist, and two gay black friends. Facebook can\u2019t do that.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gxa1q5kv53551.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5995a9ee4103566831d35e1d58c8cbfa98a2e14\n\nSnap is on the right side of history, particularly in the eyes of its young demographic. Mirrorworld will be more intertwined with our lives than any previous platform; that level of trust is crucial.\u00a0\n\n### Snappy Conclusion\n\nBecause there are so many pieces to the Snap puzzle, I feel like I\u2019m still just scratching the surface. In addition to the suites around Bitmoji and Camera, Snap also boasts **Minis, Snap Map, Local Business Listings, Voice Control**, **Snap Originals, Happening Now, Ad Kit, Story Kit, Creative Kit, and Login Kit,** and I\u2019m sure I\u2019m missing some.\n\nSnap might be the first American company to become a WeChat-style super app. Its mobile-first streaming business puts Quibi to shame and is approaching Netflix\u2019s US viewership. 125 million people interacted with its news service last year. Through Snap Kit, it powers 20 of the top 100 apps in the iOS and Google Play Store. The Snap Map is a crucial lens into the heart of the protests, offering unfiltered and unbiased views on the ground.\u00a0\n\nAnd we didn\u2019t even talk about any of those products in this piece.\n\nEven if we can\u2019t see it yet, these are not just standalone products. Snap has shown that its products connect in ways that are not obvious to outsiders. Who would have thought that personalized cartoons would serve as a Trojan Horse into games and mobile operating systems?\u00a0\n\nI started untangling and retangling all of the ways that Snap\u2019s products could work together to power the AR platform of the future, and if I can get that map to a legible place, I\u2019ll share it. Without seeing the full picture yet, though, I can already see something beautiful and powerful emerging.\n\nBy spinning a web of connected products, each building and feeding off of the others, Snap has built moats that will make it impervious to feature theft. When it all comes together, Snap will be one of the most important companies in the world.\n\nBusiness is the new sports, and I\u2019m jumping on the Snap bandwagon.\n\nIf you want to read the original, check it out here: [https://notboring.substack.com/p/oh-snap-](https://notboring.substack.com/p/oh-snap-)",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 15th, 2020.\n\n# **After big sell-off, stock market will be wary of virus and Fed testimony in week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/12/after-big-sell-off-stock-market-will-be-wary-of-virus-and-fed-testimony-in-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to reassure markets next week the central bank will do whatever it takes to help the economy heal. That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks could be caught in a tug-of-war in the week ahead, as investors weigh the potential positives of a reopening economy against worry that the coronavirus continues to spread. \n*****\n&gt; In the past week, the S&amp;P 500\u2032s sharp gains briefly drove the index into positive territory for the year, before a bruising sell-off at the end of the week. Stocks were more than 47% above the March 23 low before investors got spooked by signs the coronavirus is picking up in some areas. \n*****\n&gt; The Fed also dampened sentiment when it released economic forecasts Wednesday that showed a slow recovery and interest rates at zero through the end of 2022. Investors will hear more of the same when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks before Congress this Tuesday and Wednesday in his semi-annual economic testimony. He may provide more clarity on the Fed\u2019s bond buying and other policy moves.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales for May are released Tuesday, and that will be an important look at consumer spending activity. It is the most important data in the coming week, other than the weekly jobless claims report on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks rose on Friday with the S&amp;P 500 up more than 1% after Thursday\u2019s sharp sell-off that sent the index down nearly 6%. Treasury yields, which move opposite price, also moved sharply lower as investors moved to the safety of bonds. The 10-year yield was back to 0.70%,  well off the high of 0.95% in the week earlier.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve been overbought for awhile and digesting gains would be natural,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said the fact that 97% of the S&amp;P 500 companies\u2019 stocks were above their 50-day moving average this past week was a warning. The 50-day moving average is a momentum indicator, and if a stock or index rises above it, it is usually a positive, but if they all do, it\u2019s a contrarian warning.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cHistorically that\u2019s just too high ... and also the P/E on the S&amp;P was 25.1 of forward 12-months earnings, which is a 52% premium to the P/E average since 2000,\u201d he said. The P/E, or the price-to-earnings ratio, is an important tool to value stocks, and it averages around 16.5 times.\n*****\n&gt; In the sell-off, stocks that would benefit from the economy\u2019s reopening were the hardest hit. Investors had been jumping into those names, driving them higher at a dizzying pace. They were also the sectors that were last to join the rally, like banks, casinos, airlines and hotels.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOnce the pullback runs its course I think investors will move back again into the sectors and subsectors that were most beaten up in the bear market,\u201d said Stovall.  \n*****\n&gt; Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com, said he lightened up his holdings earlier in the week. \u201cThere were some clues early in the week that the market was vulnerable, like when the S&amp;P closed below 3,191 on Tuesday. You had some feverish trading in some of the very speculative names,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said other headwinds hang over the market, and one big one is the upcoming presidential election, which could become a bigger influence on the market. RealClearPolitics has President Donald Trump trailing former Vice President Joseph Biden by 8.1 points in the latest average of polls.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cTrump\u2019s numbers are just looking so bad, and if the Fed needs to keep interest rates at zero and we have the potential for a resurgence in Covid cases, then Trump is not going to benefit from an economic recovery, and as a result, that gives Biden a better chance of being elected,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily that the market dislikes Biden, but they dislike uncertainty. And a decline in equity prices would be representative of that uncertainty.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Consumer barometer\n&gt; Retail sales are typically a barometer for consumer spending, and when Americans were shut in their homes they did much less shopping than usual. April data showed a 16.7% drop in sales, but consumers did spend online.\n*****\n&gt; Economists are watching Tuesday\u2019s report on May sales closely, particularly after the May jobs report had a large upside surprise. There were 2.5 million jobs added in May, instead of an expected loss of 8.3 million.\n*****\n&gt; Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, said business-to-business spending data for May implies that retail sales were flat compared with April\u2019s depressed level and could be down 22% from a year ago.\n*****\n&gt; Zandi used data from Cortera, which collects information on about $1.5 trillion in business-to-business spending. In an analysis of spending by retailers in May, it found there were gains from April in some categories, including furniture, gasoline stations and restaurants.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cClothing and sporting goods store sales have been crushed, and that continued in May.  Restaurants,  gasoline stations and furniture stores have been hit hard, but showed strong improvement in May. Food and health and personal care stores have done well through the crisis, but gave some of that back in May,\u201d notes Zandi. \u201cOnline retailers, general merchandise stores (which includes WalMart and Target), and building material and garden supply stores (Home Depot and Lowes) have navigated the crisis well, and May was another solid month.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Zandi said weakness in apparel and sporting goods washed out the gains in other areas.\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead \n&gt; Strategists said Powell did not surprise the market with his comments this past week, but his sober approach reminded investors that the Fed policy will have to be in place for a very long time to pull the economy out of its deep rut. That will keep markets on high alert during his two days of testimony.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the cat\u2019s out of the bag. I don\u2019t think he can sugarcoat it. The thing he\u2019s got to worry about is he needs help. He needs Congress and the administration to come up with another fiscal rescue package. He can\u2019t do it on his own,\u201d said Zandi. \u201cHe has to keep the pressure on them and get a piece of legislation before they go on August recess.  ... He\u2019s speaking as much to the American people as he is to the policy makers.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Zandi said the Fed has acted aggressively and swiftly to unfreeze credit markets when they locked up in March, but the economy needs more stimulus ahead of a wave of potential business defaults and with a high level of unemployment. The Fed\u2019s balance sheet has ballooned to $7.2 trillion, and on Wednesday the central bank committed to monthly purchases of $80 billion in Treasury securities and $40 billion in mortgage securities.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think he continues to lay the foundation for policy changes to come,\u201d  said Zandi. \u201cHe\u2019s strongly suggesting there\u2019s going to be more monetary support, and that would come in the form of a few things - it would be performance dependent forward guidance. ... He\u2019s going to make it clear until the economy is at full employment and inflation is at least at target, if not above.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Zandi said Powell may discuss yield curve controls, which would mean the Fed would set targets for interest rate levels in the Treasury market, and make purchases to influence rates. Some economists believe the Fed  will adopt that tool before the end of the year.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think he\u2019s going to more clearly define the amount of QE they\u2019re doing going forward. He\u2019ll try to preserve some optionality, but he\u2019ll try to make it known, they\u2019re buying a lot of bonds for a long time to come,\u201d Zandi said.\n*****\n&gt; But the hearings could be more politicized, and Powell may be criticized by Congress for helping financial markets more than Main Street, said John Briggs, head of strategy at NatWest Markets. \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if there\u2019s a lot new, given it comes on the heels of the FOMC meeting,\u201d Briggs said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/pw0CUi2.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/fP1CK0o.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/UO6j0gC.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/GImgVgH.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JYCJeEm.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qcLni34.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/iC1YmSV.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qsph2Sm.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vM5brmK.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/LscP3vHv/ipos12.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/1Y2bHjI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/hrsZdEH.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Is This The Start Of A New Bear Market?\n\n&gt; \u201cStocks take an escalator up, but an elevator down.\u201d \u2014 Old investment axiom\n\n&gt; The saying above sure happened yesterday. In the end, the S&amp;P 500 Index fell 5.9% for the worst day since March 16 and the first three-day losing streak in more than three months. What does it mean? We\u2019ve been on record that we expect some type of well-deserved pullback or at least consolidation after the 45% bounce off of the March 23 lows and the best 50-day rally ever. Then add in the fact that June has been the worst month of the year for stocks since 2000 and some type of weakness is perfectly logical here and now.\n\n&gt; \u201cIn many ways, this is one of the most overbought stock markets we\u2019ve ever seen. Now the catch to this is previous times we\u2019ve seen major levels similar to now have been closer to the beginning of bull markets than the end of bull markets,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; This is now one of the greatest surges off a major low ever. It is perfectly normal to see a drawdown of double digits after the initial surge weakens. This could be happening now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We\u2019ve shown that huge up months like April tend to eventually resolve higher, but some near-term weakness is possible.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Also, when more than 90% of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are above their 50-day moving average, this shows solid longer-term results. Again, suggesting that very overbought isn\u2019t always a bad thing.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; There was a huge spike in stocks marking new monthly highs, again historically an overbought signal. This opens the door for some near-term weakness, but is a very positive sign longer-term.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Last, in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 was recently more than 13% above the 50-day moving average, one of the highest levels ever. The good news is one-year later stocks were higher every single time. Yet another clue that historically overbought isn\u2019t always a bad thing for the bulls.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; A record run, over-the-top excitement from small traders, the Nasdaq at 10,000, historically high multiples, and seasonality all could be a factor in why a pullback here could be perfectly normal. In fact, if you are bullish, after a 45% rally, one of the best things would be for prices to reset some here over the coming months. We would be a buyer of weakness and use it as an opportunity for longer-term price appreciation.\n\n*****\n\n# Persistent Volatility Runs Into Resistance &amp; Exuberant Sentiment\n\n&gt; We have all been gobsmacked by velocity and strength of this V-shaped rally off the March 23 bear market low. For the record this rally became an official Ned Davis Research defined bull market on May 26 when DJIA was up 30% from the low when it made a new recovery high after 50 calendar days (see NDR definitions below). And this was on the back of the shortest bear market on record, which lasted only 40 days. Today\u2019s market comeuppance is an important reminder that we need to be patient with this market and heed our cautious analysis and stance.\n\n&gt; This is still the \u201cWorst Six Months\u201d and as we warned in the May Outlook when the market is down during the \u201cBest Six Months\u201d (November-April) as they were in 2020, the \u201cWorst Six Months\u201d (May-October) were down or flat 86% of the time with a median S&amp;P decline of -6.7% since 1950.\n\n&gt; Other seasonal indicators are also flashing the caution sign. This year\u2019s negative January Barometer and breached December DJIA low, point to possible retests of the lows and choppy, volatile trading over the next several months. See the updated composite graph of the seasonal pattern for these 22 years since 1950 in the June Outlook.\n\n&gt; It appears that quite a fair amount of hope was built into the rally. Lots of hope that everything is just going back to the way it was real soon. But COVID cases are on the climb again and folks are concerned that a pause and/or reverse of reopening could delay the economic recovery and derail the bull. Up until the past few days it felt like mid-February again with the market ignoring economic and corporate data as momentum pushed everything higher.\n\n&gt; The jobs report was a bit unbelievable and then Fed Chairman Powell\u2019s candor and reserved outlook at yesterday\u2019s press conference put the fear right back into the market today. Meanwhile the Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDPNow model currently estimates that 2020 Q2 GDP growth will be down -48.5%.\n\n&gt; Sentiment had also become rather exuberant as the Weekly CBOE Equity Only Put/Call ratio we track in the \u201cPulse of the Market\u201d hit 0.43 last week \u2013 its lowest level since the week ending 4/10/2010 about three weeks before the infamous flash crash. Investor\u2019s Intelligence Advisors Sentiment survey Bullish advisors are now up to 56.9%. Correction advisors are down to 22.5% while Bearish advisors have slipped further to 20.6%, putting us at caution levels.\n\n&gt; Technically, things deteriorated rapidly today. After blasting through several levels of resistance we have been tracking as shown in the chart here S&amp;P 500 stalled at 3210 and plunged 5.9% today through 3115 support/resistance and closed just below 3010 support/resistance which sits at the 2019 summer highs. The next major support level below here is 2725 right near where the 50-day moving average turned up in mid-May, which would be a 15.7% correction from the recent recovery high reached this past Monday, June 8.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7d877af1643a7342c0c8622cbc763c92/eb566818257f08b5-2b/s500x750/8228cad8989a5456266c3f0d753168c4d3c3efec.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Ned Davis Research bull and bear market definitions:\n\n&gt; A cyclical bull market requires a 30% rise in the DJIA after 50 calendar days or a 13% rise after 155 calendar days. Reversals of 30% in the Value Line Geometric Index since 1965 also qualify. A cyclical bear market requires a 30% drop in the DJIA after 50 calendar days or a 13% decline after 145 calendar days. Reversals in the Value Line Geometric Index also qualify. Bull and bear markets are measured at peak and trough dates, so both the time and price criteria must be met as of the peak and trough dates.\n\n*****\n\n# More Volatility Likely During June Options Expiration Week and Beyond\n\n&gt; The second Triple Witching Week (Quadruple Witching if you prefer) of the year brings on some volatile trading with losses frequently exceeding gains. NASDAQ has the weakest record on the first trading day of the week. Triple-Witching Friday is usually better, DJIA has been up ten of the last seventeen years.\n\n&gt; Full-week performance is choppy as well, littered with greater than 1% moves in both directions. The week after Triple-Witching Day is horrendous. This week has experienced DJIA losses in 26 of the last 30 years with an average decline of 1.07%.

Only back in Feb-March where we saw the drop into the abyss, did i get a feeling that there was no bottom, as we keept banging throug support levels.\n\nWhat do you think will determine tomorrow?

What Front Point Partners knew was still a secret.\n\nOn the other hand, the doomers in this sub kept repeating the same arguments over and over again: second wave, huge unemployment, etc. That **wasn't a big secret** to anyone. People with money to move markets knew that, and rightfully shrugged it off. I know it's become a meme here, but that's what priced in means.\n\nUnless you know something most people haven't figure out yet, you're not going to beat the market. In high frequency trading, this advantage is done by getting relatively simple information faster than everyone else - rule of thumb, if it's on the news already, it's been arbitraged away. In longer term investing, this is done through predictive models. The medium frequency traders find ways to predict probabilities of momentum and reversal to mean, and the low frequency traders, also known as investors, will model the future cashflows of the business based on macro, industry, and other types of information.\n\nFinally, when you think the market is irrational, just remember that means you're saying you're smarter than almost everyone else in the markets. The likelihood of that for the average Reddit user: 0%. So either, [be faster, smarter, but don't cheat](https://youtu.be/Hhy7JUinlu0?t=381).",

        "selftext": "Occasionally people ask how these loans work. Here's how. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe basics are the same everywhere but I'm doing this from a Canadian perspective which means I'm ignoring the US SEC Regulation T, special memorandum account, overnight maintenance requirement, initial margin, and pattern day trading rule, because all of those are concepts that have no equivalent or application in Canada. I'm also ignoring U.S. risk-based portfolio margin because we also don't have that in Canada, besides, in that case the calculations are based off of a commodity futures risk-based methdology, not rules-based traditional margin. But the basics are the same. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMargin in Canada hasn't really changed since the 1920's, except you have to put up at least 30% nowadays instead of 10% back before the crash of 1929.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Canada you can borrow up to 70% of a position at once for most stocks.  In Canada, the government doesn't regulate margin. The banks do that job themselves, so it hasn't changed much in 100 years. Only difference is that you had to have a lot of money to do it 25 years ago and so far as I know, today banks in Canada will let you open margin accounts without minimums, at least BMO which I am with does.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis means that if you want to buy $10,000 worth of RBC or Apple, you only have to put up $3,000 and your broker lends you the rest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMargin was invented by the Dutch who basically invented the modern financial system in the 1600s. Eventually the British took it over and ran with it, exporting that system to the 13 colonies. After they defeated Napoleon and went on to build the British Empire they exported that system to Canada and Australia for example. But it's really the Dutch who started it all around the time of Vermeer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe concept is that the bank will lend against some of your stock, but not all of it. They want a \"haircut.\" The haircut is the amount they won't lend against. In Canada the haircut is usually 30% but can be 50% and there are some stocks the banks won't lend against at all, like most of the stuff on the TSX-V or on the U.S. pink sheets. Every bank is different, so BMO InvestorLine might lend 50% on one small cap and TD Direct Investing 30% or vice versa for another. But most things are 30%, some are 50% and some are 100% (meaning no loan).   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe leverage is 1/haircut.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo say you have $3,000 and you want to buy on margin. As the bank haircut (margin rate) is 30%, you can buy $3,000/0.3 = $10,000 worth of stock. Obviously you then have a loan of $7,000. You now have $10,000 worth of stock, but remember, the bank won't let you borrow against 30%\\*$10,000 = $3,000. So your collateral is only $7,000. So you now have a $7,000 loan collateralized by $7,000 worth of stock. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the above example, you put up 30% margin, the same as the haircut. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's easy to see that if your total position slides so much as a dollar, you will have less collateral than $7,000 and therefore get what's called a margin call where the bank if it's BMO literally calls you on your cell and they tell you that you have to put up more money in a few hours or sell stock(which automatically pays down the loan to the extent of the sale) so that you have enough collateral to cover your loan, otherwise they wil automatically sell a stock of their choosing at an amount of their choosing. They are also allowed to sell whichever stock they choose automatically without calling you first, in the event of a margin call. That is explicitly set out in your margin agreement.  So obviously you need some \"buffer\" because of volatility, but how much do you borrow?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow you have to understand some math. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntarget margin = 1-(1-x)\\*(1-haircut)\n\nx is the price drawdown\n\ntarget margin is how much margin you have to put up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSay Apple is marginable at 30% (the haircut) by your bank. You decide you want to borrow on margin. But you decide, \"I will allow Apple to slide 40% from what I buy it at before I get a margin call.\" So how much margin should you put up?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntarget margin = 1-(1-0.4)\\*(1-0.3) = 1-0.6\\*0.7 = 1-0.42 = 0.58.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo you have to put up 58% margin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat means if you have $3,000 to invest, you would buy $3,000/0.58 = $5,172 worth of Apple. If Apple is trading at $350 that means it can slide to $210 before you get a margin call. At which point you will have lost 0.4/0.58 = 68.9% of your money. (Remember, leverage is simply 1/margin.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe formula above is simply a rearrangement using basic algebra, of the basic margin equation which is:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**price at margin call = initial price of stock\\*(1-target margin)/(1-haircut)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this is a handy reference.",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 15th, 2020.\n\n# **After big sell-off, stock market will be wary of virus and Fed testimony in week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/12/after-big-sell-off-stock-market-will-be-wary-of-virus-and-fed-testimony-in-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to reassure markets next week the central bank will do whatever it takes to help the economy heal. That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks could be caught in a tug-of-war in the week ahead, as investors weigh the potential positives of a reopening economy against worry that the coronavirus continues to spread. \n*****\n&gt; In the past week, the S&amp;P 500\u2032s sharp gains briefly drove the index into positive territory for the year, before a bruising sell-off at the end of the week. Stocks were more than 47% above the March 23 low before investors got spooked by signs the coronavirus is picking up in some areas. \n*****\n&gt; The Fed also dampened sentiment when it released economic forecasts Wednesday that showed a slow recovery and interest rates at zero through the end of 2022. Investors will hear more of the same when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks before Congress this Tuesday and Wednesday in his semi-annual economic testimony. He may provide more clarity on the Fed\u2019s bond buying and other policy moves.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales for May are released Tuesday, and that will be an important look at consumer spending activity. It is the most important data in the coming week, other than the weekly jobless claims report on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks rose on Friday with the S&amp;P 500 up more than 1% after Thursday\u2019s sharp sell-off that sent the index down nearly 6%. Treasury yields, which move opposite price, also moved sharply lower as investors moved to the safety of bonds. The 10-year yield was back to 0.70%,  well off the high of 0.95% in the week earlier.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve been overbought for awhile and digesting gains would be natural,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said the fact that 97% of the S&amp;P 500 companies\u2019 stocks were above their 50-day moving average this past week was a warning. The 50-day moving average is a momentum indicator, and if a stock or index rises above it, it is usually a positive, but if they all do, it\u2019s a contrarian warning.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cHistorically that\u2019s just too high ... and also the P/E on the S&amp;P was 25.1 of forward 12-months earnings, which is a 52% premium to the P/E average since 2000,\u201d he said. The P/E, or the price-to-earnings ratio, is an important tool to value stocks, and it averages around 16.5 times.\n*****\n&gt; In the sell-off, stocks that would benefit from the economy\u2019s reopening were the hardest hit. Investors had been jumping into those names, driving them higher at a dizzying pace. They were also the sectors that were last to join the rally, like banks, casinos, airlines and hotels.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOnce the pullback runs its course I think investors will move back again into the sectors and subsectors that were most beaten up in the bear market,\u201d said Stovall.  \n*****\n&gt; Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com, said he lightened up his holdings earlier in the week. \u201cThere were some clues early in the week that the market was vulnerable, like when the S&amp;P closed below 3,191 on Tuesday. You had some feverish trading in some of the very speculative names,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said other headwinds hang over the market, and one big one is the upcoming presidential election, which could become a bigger influence on the market. RealClearPolitics has President Donald Trump trailing former Vice President Joseph Biden by 8.1 points in the latest average of polls.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cTrump\u2019s numbers are just looking so bad, and if the Fed needs to keep interest rates at zero and we have the potential for a resurgence in Covid cases, then Trump is not going to benefit from an economic recovery, and as a result, that gives Biden a better chance of being elected,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily that the market dislikes Biden, but they dislike uncertainty. And a decline in equity prices would be representative of that uncertainty.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Consumer barometer\n&gt; Retail sales are typically a barometer for consumer spending, and when Americans were shut in their homes they did much less shopping than usual. April data showed a 16.7% drop in sales, but consumers did spend online.\n*****\n&gt; Economists are watching Tuesday\u2019s report on May sales closely, particularly after the May jobs report had a large upside surprise. There were 2.5 million jobs added in May, instead of an expected loss of 8.3 million.\n*****\n&gt; Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, said business-to-business spending data for May implies that retail sales were flat compared with April\u2019s depressed level and could be down 22% from a year ago.\n*****\n&gt; Zandi used data from Cortera, which collects information on about $1.5 trillion in business-to-business spending. In an analysis of spending by retailers in May, it found there were gains from April in some categories, including furniture, gasoline stations and restaurants.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cClothing and sporting goods store sales have been crushed, and that continued in May.  Restaurants,  gasoline stations and furniture stores have been hit hard, but showed strong improvement in May. Food and health and personal care stores have done well through the crisis, but gave some of that back in May,\u201d notes Zandi. \u201cOnline retailers, general merchandise stores (which includes WalMart and Target), and building material and garden supply stores (Home Depot and Lowes) have navigated the crisis well, and May was another solid month.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Zandi said weakness in apparel and sporting goods washed out the gains in other areas.\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead \n&gt; Strategists said Powell did not surprise the market with his comments this past week, but his sober approach reminded investors that the Fed policy will have to be in place for a very long time to pull the economy out of its deep rut. That will keep markets on high alert during his two days of testimony.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the cat\u2019s out of the bag. I don\u2019t think he can sugarcoat it. The thing he\u2019s got to worry about is he needs help. He needs Congress and the administration to come up with another fiscal rescue package. He can\u2019t do it on his own,\u201d said Zandi. \u201cHe has to keep the pressure on them and get a piece of legislation before they go on August recess.  ... He\u2019s speaking as much to the American people as he is to the policy makers.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Zandi said the Fed has acted aggressively and swiftly to unfreeze credit markets when they locked up in March, but the economy needs more stimulus ahead of a wave of potential business defaults and with a high level of unemployment. The Fed\u2019s balance sheet has ballooned to $7.2 trillion, and on Wednesday the central bank committed to monthly purchases of $80 billion in Treasury securities and $40 billion in mortgage securities.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think he continues to lay the foundation for policy changes to come,\u201d  said Zandi. \u201cHe\u2019s strongly suggesting there\u2019s going to be more monetary support, and that would come in the form of a few things - it would be performance dependent forward guidance. ... He\u2019s going to make it clear until the economy is at full employment and inflation is at least at target, if not above.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Zandi said Powell may discuss yield curve controls, which would mean the Fed would set targets for interest rate levels in the Treasury market, and make purchases to influence rates. Some economists believe the Fed  will adopt that tool before the end of the year.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think he\u2019s going to more clearly define the amount of QE they\u2019re doing going forward. He\u2019ll try to preserve some optionality, but he\u2019ll try to make it known, they\u2019re buying a lot of bonds for a long time to come,\u201d Zandi said.\n*****\n&gt; But the hearings could be more politicized, and Powell may be criticized by Congress for helping financial markets more than Main Street, said John Briggs, head of strategy at NatWest Markets. \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if there\u2019s a lot new, given it comes on the heels of the FOMC meeting,\u201d Briggs said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/pw0CUi2.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/fP1CK0o.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/UO6j0gC.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/GImgVgH.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JYCJeEm.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qcLni34.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/iC1YmSV.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qsph2Sm.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vM5brmK.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/LscP3vHv/ipos12.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/1Y2bHjI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/hrsZdEH.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Is This The Start Of A New Bear Market?\n\n&gt; \u201cStocks take an escalator up, but an elevator down.\u201d \u2014 Old investment axiom\n\n&gt; The saying above sure happened yesterday. In the end, the S&amp;P 500 Index fell 5.9% for the worst day since March 16 and the first three-day losing streak in more than three months. What does it mean? We\u2019ve been on record that we expect some type of well-deserved pullback or at least consolidation after the 45% bounce off of the March 23 lows and the best 50-day rally ever. Then add in the fact that June has been the worst month of the year for stocks since 2000 and some type of weakness is perfectly logical here and now.\n\n&gt; \u201cIn many ways, this is one of the most overbought stock markets we\u2019ve ever seen. Now the catch to this is previous times we\u2019ve seen major levels similar to now have been closer to the beginning of bull markets than the end of bull markets,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; This is now one of the greatest surges off a major low ever. It is perfectly normal to see a drawdown of double digits after the initial surge weakens. This could be happening now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We\u2019ve shown that huge up months like April tend to eventually resolve higher, but some near-term weakness is possible.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Also, when more than 90% of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are above their 50-day moving average, this shows solid longer-term results. Again, suggesting that very overbought isn\u2019t always a bad thing.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; There was a huge spike in stocks marking new monthly highs, again historically an overbought signal. This opens the door for some near-term weakness, but is a very positive sign longer-term.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Last, in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 was recently more than 13% above the 50-day moving average, one of the highest levels ever. The good news is one-year later stocks were higher every single time. Yet another clue that historically overbought isn\u2019t always a bad thing for the bulls.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; A record run, over-the-top excitement from small traders, the Nasdaq at 10,000, historically high multiples, and seasonality all could be a factor in why a pullback here could be perfectly normal. In fact, if you are bullish, after a 45% rally, one of the best things would be for prices to reset some here over the coming months. We would be a buyer of weakness and use it as an opportunity for longer-term price appreciation.\n\n*****\n\n# Persistent Volatility Runs Into Resistance &amp; Exuberant Sentiment\n\n&gt; We have all been gobsmacked by velocity and strength of this V-shaped rally off the March 23 bear market low. For the record this rally became an official Ned Davis Research defined bull market on May 26 when DJIA was up 30% from the low when it made a new recovery high after 50 calendar days (see NDR definitions below). And this was on the back of the shortest bear market on record, which lasted only 40 days. Today\u2019s market comeuppance is an important reminder that we need to be patient with this market and heed our cautious analysis and stance.\n\n&gt; This is still the \u201cWorst Six Months\u201d and as we warned in the May Outlook when the market is down during the \u201cBest Six Months\u201d (November-April) as they were in 2020, the \u201cWorst Six Months\u201d (May-October) were down or flat 86% of the time with a median S&amp;P decline of -6.7% since 1950.\n\n&gt; Other seasonal indicators are also flashing the caution sign. This year\u2019s negative January Barometer and breached December DJIA low, point to possible retests of the lows and choppy, volatile trading over the next several months. See the updated composite graph of the seasonal pattern for these 22 years since 1950 in the June Outlook.\n\n&gt; It appears that quite a fair amount of hope was built into the rally. Lots of hope that everything is just going back to the way it was real soon. But COVID cases are on the climb again and folks are concerned that a pause and/or reverse of reopening could delay the economic recovery and derail the bull. Up until the past few days it felt like mid-February again with the market ignoring economic and corporate data as momentum pushed everything higher.\n\n&gt; The jobs report was a bit unbelievable and then Fed Chairman Powell\u2019s candor and reserved outlook at yesterday\u2019s press conference put the fear right back into the market today. Meanwhile the Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDPNow model currently estimates that 2020 Q2 GDP growth will be down -48.5%.\n\n&gt; Sentiment had also become rather exuberant as the Weekly CBOE Equity Only Put/Call ratio we track in the \u201cPulse of the Market\u201d hit 0.43 last week \u2013 its lowest level since the week ending 4/10/2010 about three weeks before the infamous flash crash. Investor\u2019s Intelligence Advisors Sentiment survey Bullish advisors are now up to 56.9%. Correction advisors are down to 22.5% while Bearish advisors have slipped further to 20.6%, putting us at caution levels.\n\n&gt; Technically, things deteriorated rapidly today. After blasting through several levels of resistance we have been tracking as shown in the chart here S&amp;P 500 stalled at 3210 and plunged 5.9% today through 3115 support/resistance and closed just below 3010 support/resistance which sits at the 2019 summer highs. The next major support level below here is 2725 right near where the 50-day moving average turned up in mid-May, which would be a 15.7% correction from the recent recovery high reached this past Monday, June 8.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7d877af1643a7342c0c8622cbc763c92/eb566818257f08b5-2b/s500x750/8228cad8989a5456266c3f0d753168c4d3c3efec.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Ned Davis Research bull and bear market definitions:\n\n&gt; A cyclical bull market requires a 30% rise in the DJIA after 50 calendar days or a 13% rise after 155 calendar days. Reversals of 30% in the Value Line Geometric Index since 1965 also qualify. A cyclical bear market requires a 30% drop in the DJIA after 50 calendar days or a 13% decline after 145 calendar days. Reversals in the Value Line Geometric Index also qualify. Bull and bear markets are measured at peak and trough dates, so both the time and price criteria must be met as of the peak and trough dates.\n\n*****\n\n# More Volatility Likely During June Options Expiration Week and Beyond\n\n&gt; The second Triple Witching Week (Quadruple Witching if you prefer) of the year brings on some volatile trading with losses frequently exceeding gains. NASDAQ has the weakest record on the first trading day of the week. Triple-Witching Friday is usually better, DJIA has been up ten of the last seventeen years.\n\n&gt; Full-week performance is choppy as well, littered with greater than 1% moves in both directions. The week after Triple-Witching Day is horrendous. This week has experienced DJIA losses in 26 of the last 30 years with an average decline of 1.07%. S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have fared slightly better during the week after over the same 30-year span, declining 0.72% and 0.23% respectively on average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cbdc17aecf40cbf412100049a35e7f1b/4c6fa6c95e723529-93/s500x750/0bd7385e1b398b3c223892fe86cd1886d41bc9fd.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8de0bdcd706b729d7e5ebe8fd92670b9/4c6fa6c95e723529-e7/s500x750/fa1a12f3de57328b97c1f4f5a274d24e94fd19de.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/09c9ca9d3a0502b4a8d97976bd73366e/4c6fa6c95e723529-cf/s500x750/498b4d398dde04ebb764b72d962aa53378b29260.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$KR** \n&gt; * **$MFA** \n&gt; * **$GRPN** \n&gt; * **$JKS** \n&gt; * **$ORCL** \n&gt; * **$LEN** \n&gt; * **$KMX** \n&gt; * **$TSQ** \n&gt; * **$HRB** \n&gt; * **$MPAA** \n&gt; * **$SWBI** \n&gt; * **$CMC** \n&gt; * **$RGS** \n&gt; * **$TTM** \n&gt; * **$HOME** \n&gt; * **$JBL** \n&gt; * **$DBI** \n&gt; * **$AMSWA** \n&gt; * **$ABM** \n&gt; * **$BNGO** \n&gt; * **$CNTG** \n&gt; * **$LMB** \n&gt; * **$LIVX** \n&gt; * **$ALYA** \n&gt; * **$GAN** \n&gt; * **$INWK** \n&gt; * **$VOLT** \n&gt; * **$UROV** \n&gt; * **$VNCE**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/vM5brmK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/l3jztzJ.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.15.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/shKM8RG.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.16.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PYffarr.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0uE8QeB.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/bNd3sxx.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HdpyR9B.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.18.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DNsufe6.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.19.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FHBG6yj.png))\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.19.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Kroger Co. $32.26\n&gt; **Kroger Co.

        "selftext": "So im one of those guys, who invested in Wirecard and want to share some of my experience.\n\nAfterwards one is always smarter or what\u2019s the word? With Wirecard, I was actually really wrong. I think that you have to stand up for it and you should check whether you made a mistake in your investment decision. I want to work through that in this report.\n\nHow did the investment come about, why did I hold on to the company despite the attacks of the short sellers and the reports of the Financial Times? No matter how the result turns out in the end, it is always worth thinking about your bad investments and questioning yourself even more self-critically. This is the only way, and I am convinced of this, to get ahead on the stock market.\n\n## Why did I invest in Wirecard at all?\n\nI actually stayed away from Wirecard for a long time. I missed the price increases of the last few years. Before contactless payment became more and more popular, I did not have this trend on my screen. So I did not continue to deal with the company. In addition, until a few years ago I only and exclusively dealt with strong dividend payers. That has changed somewhat in the last 3 years. I have further developed myself and my investment style, as probably everyone does.\n\nThen the Apple Watch came to my wrist and the possibility to pay contactlessly with the watch everywhere. More and more people were doing it and the topic was more and more often covered in the media and relevant stock market magazines. Since I don\u2019t buy bank shares due to bad experiences, I had a gap in my portfolio. How do you fill it now? I decided on system providers who have their foot very far in the door. That was VISA on the one hand and Adyen and Wirecard on the other. I liked the story at Wirecard. Not least of all, that a man named Markus Braun is obviously such a passionate manager who managed to launch the store from nowhere into a world-famous corporation within a few years. Sales and profits knew only one direction. Due to the many untapped markets, the chance of a growth rocket emerged. Despite the already immense price increases \u2013 there was still plenty of room for the next few years. I dared the first small entry with 5 shares at a price of 135 Euro.  \n\n\n## The shortsellers are coming\n\nAt some point, the time was when the short sellers attacked and the reports in the Financial Times about inconsistencies in the balance sheet. For me it was a classic. I thought: Hey, we\u2019re talking about a DAX company here. Who else would you choose to attack from the DAX? The business is entangled and you need subcontractors or partners all over the world to be able to represent the transaction at all. It is difficult to see through that, even if you do everything right. A real find, then. Moreover, the price of the share had long since been geared to the growth of the company. That means that future growth was already priced in. Such shares are increasingly susceptible to volatility as those of solidly valued companies where the price reflects the business. So what did I do? Repurchased, of course!\n\n## Why did I stick with Wirecard and what did I learn?\n\nI just couldn\u2019t believe it. It was beyond irrational. If I have to realize that you can\u2019t hide something like that forever, it should have been clear to a CEO of a DAX company long ago. Besides, every year there was a certificate and economic report from the renowned auditors. You look twice as much on the fingers of a DAX company.\n\nWrongly conceived!\u00a0That is the greatest learning in history. You cannot even trust the auditors to do their job properly. I have closed my eyes for too long in good faith that there are too many functioning control bodies. With my capabilities, I have to trust my gut. But even large investment funds like DWS, which can have insight into the company at any time, have been deceived.\n\nI am convinced that no small shareholder could have foreseen the fraud itself, but I decided for myself that as soon as shortsellers on a large scale start attacking a stock somewhere, I am OUT! We small shareholders have even less insight than the big boys and then such an investment quickly turns into a gamble. Since my money is too good for gambling I will keep my hands off such shares in the future. There are so many wonderful opportunities and companies, it is not necessary to take such a ride on the cannonball.\n\n## What did I do with the Wirecard shares?\n\nI still have it! At the first massive slide last Thursday, I still thought something was wrong. Why does the auditor only come around the corner on the day the annual financial statements are published and say \u201cHey, we\u2019re missing 1.9 billion euros\u201d? I thought it was clearing up. If I sell now, I\u2019ll have massive losses and tomorrow the price will go through the roof. On Friday, when it was clear that there was no 1.9 billion or the two banks did not know Wirecard as customers, it was too late to sell. All in all, I have never been heavily invested in Wirecard. I had and have a total of 20 shares. At a price of 80 euros I can sell them +/- 0. I have decided to sit out the dilemma. I have mentally written off the money but who knows: Maybe there will be a turn around story with new management at some point or another company or bank will buy Wirecard.\n\nIn this sense, my thoughts are with those who had to cope with high losses with Wirecard. It shows once again how important diversification is. Do not put all your eggs in one basket. A good guideline is certainly that no position in the portfolio should amount to more than 5%. I do very well with a maximum of 2-3 %. But that also means a lot of work, as I have to deal with more and more companies all the time.\n\nIt is important that you do not let your head hang down and question whether company investments are the right investment. To lie beside it belongs to it when investing. It is much more important to learn from it. To look the facts in the eye and to question critically where you could have done something better yourself. On the stock exchange, nothing is as important as experience \u2013 the good ones, and unfortunately also the bad ones!\n\nAre you invested in Wirecard or have you sold at a loss? I am looking forward to your comment.",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 15th, 2020.\n\n# **After big sell-off, stock market will be wary of virus and Fed testimony in week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/12/after-big-sell-off-stock-market-will-be-wary-of-virus-and-fed-testimony-in-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to reassure markets next week the central bank will do whatever it takes to help the economy heal. That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks could be caught in a tug-of-war in the week ahead, as investors weigh the potential positives of a reopening economy against worry that the coronavirus continues to spread. \n*****\n&gt; In the past week, the S&amp;P 500\u2032s sharp gains briefly drove the index into positive territory for the year, before a bruising sell-off at the end of the week. Stocks were more than 47% above the March 23 low before investors got spooked by signs the coronavirus is picking up in some areas. \n*****\n&gt; The Fed also dampened sentiment when it released economic forecasts Wednesday that showed a slow recovery and interest rates at zero through the end of 2022. Investors will hear more of the same when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks before Congress this Tuesday and Wednesday in his semi-annual economic testimony. He may provide more clarity on the Fed\u2019s bond buying and other policy moves.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales for May are released Tuesday, and that will be an important look at consumer spending activity. It is the most important data in the coming week, other than the weekly jobless claims report on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks rose on Friday with the S&amp;P 500 up more than 1% after Thursday\u2019s sharp sell-off that sent the index down nearly 6%. Treasury yields, which move opposite price, also moved sharply lower as investors moved to the safety of bonds. The 10-year yield was back to 0.70%,  well off the high of 0.95% in the week earlier.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve been overbought for awhile and digesting gains would be natural,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said the fact that 97% of the S&amp;P 500 companies\u2019 stocks were above their 50-day moving average this past week was a warning. The 50-day moving average is a momentum indicator, and if a stock or index rises above it, it is usually a positive, but if they all do, it\u2019s a contrarian warning.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cHistorically that\u2019s just too high ... and also the P/E on the S&amp;P was 25.1 of forward 12-months earnings, which is a 52% premium to the P/E average since 2000,\u201d he said. The P/E, or the price-to-earnings ratio, is an important tool to value stocks, and it averages around 16.5 times.\n*****\n&gt; In the sell-off, stocks that would benefit from the economy\u2019s reopening were the hardest hit. Investors had been jumping into those names, driving them higher at a dizzying pace. They were also the sectors that were last to join the rally, like banks, casinos, airlines and hotels.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOnce the pullback runs its course I think investors will move back again into the sectors and subsectors that were most beaten up in the bear market,\u201d said Stovall.  \n*****\n&gt; Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com, said he lightened up his holdings earlier in the week. \u201cThere were some clues early in the week that the market was vulnerable, like when the S&amp;P closed below 3,191 on Tuesday. You had some feverish trading in some of the very speculative names,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said other headwinds hang over the market, and one big one is the upcoming presidential election, which could become a bigger influence on the market. RealClearPolitics has President Donald Trump trailing former Vice President Joseph Biden by 8.1 points in the latest average of polls.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cTrump\u2019s numbers are just looking so bad, and if the Fed needs to keep interest rates at zero and we have the potential for a resurgence in Covid cases, then Trump is not going to benefit from an economic recovery, and as a result, that gives Biden a better chance of being elected,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily that the market dislikes Biden, but they dislike uncertainty. And a decline in equity prices would be representative of that uncertainty.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Consumer barometer\n&gt; Retail sales are typically a barometer for consumer spending, and when Americans were shut in their homes they did much less shopping than usual. April data showed a 16.7% drop in sales, but consumers did spend online.\n*****\n&gt; Economists are watching Tuesday\u2019s report on May sales closely, particularly after the May jobs report had a large upside surprise. There were 2.5 million jobs added in May, instead of an expected loss of 8.3 million.\n*****\n&gt; Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, said business-to-business spending data for May implies that retail sales were flat compared with April\u2019s depressed level and could be down 22% from a year ago.\n*****\n&gt; Zandi used data from Cortera, which collects information on about $1.5 trillion in business-to-business spending. In an analysis of spending by retailers in May, it found there were gains from April in some categories, including furniture, gasoline stations and restaurants.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cClothing and sporting goods store sales have been crushed, and that continued in May.  Restaurants,  gasoline stations and furniture stores have been hit hard, but showed strong improvement in May. Food and health and personal care stores have done well through the crisis, but gave some of that back in May,\u201d notes Zandi. \u201cOnline retailers, general merchandise stores (which includes WalMart and Target), and building material and garden supply stores (Home Depot and Lowes) have navigated the crisis well, and May was another solid month.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Zandi said weakness in apparel and sporting goods washed out the gains in other areas.\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead \n&gt; Strategists said Powell did not surprise the market with his comments this past week, but his sober approach reminded investors that the Fed policy will have to be in place for a very long time to pull the economy out of its deep rut. That will keep markets on high alert during his two days of testimony.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the cat\u2019s out of the bag. I don\u2019t think he can sugarcoat it. The thing he\u2019s got to worry about is he needs help. He needs Congress and the administration to come up with another fiscal rescue package. He can\u2019t do it on his own,\u201d said Zandi. \u201cHe has to keep the pressure on them and get a piece of legislation before they go on August recess.  ... He\u2019s speaking as much to the American people as he is to the policy makers.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Zandi said the Fed has acted aggressively and swiftly to unfreeze credit markets when they locked up in March, but the economy needs more stimulus ahead of a wave of potential business defaults and with a high level of unemployment. The Fed\u2019s balance sheet has ballooned to $7.2 trillion, and on Wednesday the central bank committed to monthly purchases of $80 billion in Treasury securities and $40 billion in mortgage securities.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think he continues to lay the foundation for policy changes to come,\u201d  said Zandi. \u201cHe\u2019s strongly suggesting there\u2019s going to be more monetary support, and that would come in the form of a few things - it would be performance dependent forward guidance. ... He\u2019s going to make it clear until the economy is at full employment and inflation is at least at target, if not above.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Zandi said Powell may discuss yield curve controls, which would mean the Fed would set targets for interest rate levels in the Treasury market, and make purchases to influence rates. Some economists believe the Fed  will adopt that tool before the end of the year.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think he\u2019s going to more clearly define the amount of QE they\u2019re doing going forward. He\u2019ll try to preserve some optionality, but he\u2019ll try to make it known, they\u2019re buying a lot of bonds for a long time to come,\u201d Zandi said.\n*****\n&gt; But the hearings could be more politicized, and Powell may be criticized by Congress for helping financial markets more than Main Street, said John Briggs, head of strategy at NatWest Markets. \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if there\u2019s a lot new, given it comes on the heels of the FOMC meeting,\u201d Briggs said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/pw0CUi2.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/fP1CK0o.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/UO6j0gC.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/GImgVgH.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JYCJeEm.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qcLni34.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/iC1YmSV.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qsph2Sm.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vM5brmK.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/LscP3vHv/ipos12.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/1Y2bHjI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/hrsZdEH.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Is This The Start Of A New Bear Market?\n\n&gt; \u201cStocks take an escalator up, but an elevator down.\u201d \u2014 Old investment axiom\n\n&gt; The saying above sure happened yesterday. In the end, the S&amp;P 500 Index fell 5.9% for the worst day since March 16 and the first three-day losing streak in more than three months. What does it mean? We\u2019ve been on record that we expect some type of well-deserved pullback or at least consolidation after the 45% bounce off of the March 23 lows and the best 50-day rally ever. Then add in the fact that June has been the worst month of the year for stocks since 2000 and some type of weakness is perfectly logical here and now.\n\n&gt; \u201cIn many ways, this is one of the most overbought stock markets we\u2019ve ever seen. Now the catch to this is previous times we\u2019ve seen major levels similar to now have been closer to the beginning of bull markets than the end of bull markets,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; This is now one of the greatest surges off a major low ever. It is perfectly normal to see a drawdown of double digits after the initial surge weakens. This could be happening now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We\u2019ve shown that huge up months like April tend to eventually resolve higher, but some near-term weakness is possible.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Also, when more than 90% of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are above their 50-day moving average, this shows solid longer-term results. Again, suggesting that very overbought isn\u2019t always a bad thing.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; There was a huge spike in stocks marking new monthly highs, again historically an overbought signal. This opens the door for some near-term weakness, but is a very positive sign longer-term.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Last, in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 was recently more than 13% above the 50-day moving average, one of the highest levels ever. The good news is one-year later stocks were higher every single time. Yet another clue that historically overbought isn\u2019t always a bad thing for the bulls.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; A record run, over-the-top excitement from small traders, the Nasdaq at 10,000, historically high multiples, and seasonality all could be a factor in why a pullback here could be perfectly normal. In fact, if you are bullish, after a 45% rally, one of the best things would be for prices to reset some here over the coming months. We would be a buyer of weakness and use it as an opportunity for longer-term price appreciation.\n\n*****\n\n# Persistent Volatility Runs Into Resistance &amp; Exuberant Sentiment\n\n&gt; We have all been gobsmacked by velocity and strength of this V-shaped rally off the March 23 bear market low. For the record this rally became an official Ned Davis Research defined bull market on May 26 when DJIA was up 30% from the low when it made a new recovery high after 50 calendar days (see NDR definitions below). And this was on the back of the shortest bear market on record, which lasted only 40 days. Today\u2019s market comeuppance is an important reminder that we need to be patient with this market and heed our cautious analysis and stance.\n\n&gt; This is still the \u201cWorst Six Months\u201d and as we warned in the May Outlook when the market is down during the \u201cBest Six Months\u201d (November-April) as they were in 2020, the \u201cWorst Six Months\u201d (May-October) were down or flat 86% of the time with a median S&amp;P decline of -6.7% since 1950.\n\n&gt; Other seasonal indicators are also flashing the caution sign. This year\u2019s negative January Barometer and breached December DJIA low, point to possible retests of the lows and choppy, volatile trading over the next several months. See the updated composite graph of the seasonal pattern for these 22 years since 1950 in the June Outlook.\n\n&gt; It appears that quite a fair amount of hope was built into the rally. Lots of hope that everything is just going back to the way it was real soon. But COVID cases are on the climb again and folks are concerned that a pause and/or reverse of reopening could delay the economic recovery and derail the bull. Up until the past few days it felt like mid-February again with the market ignoring economic and corporate data as momentum pushed everything higher.\n\n&gt; The jobs report was a bit unbelievable and then Fed Chairman Powell\u2019s candor and reserved outlook at yesterday\u2019s press conference put the fear right back into the market today. Meanwhile the Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDPNow model currently estimates that 2020 Q2 GDP growth will be down -48.5%.\n\n&gt; Sentiment had also become rather exuberant as the Weekly CBOE Equity Only Put/Call ratio we track in the \u201cPulse of the Market\u201d hit 0.43 last week \u2013 its lowest level since the week ending 4/10/2010 about three weeks before the infamous flash crash. Investor\u2019s Intelligence Advisors Sentiment survey Bullish advisors are now up to 56.9%. Correction advisors are down to 22.5% while Bearish advisors have slipped further to 20.6%, putting us at caution levels.\n\n&gt; Technically, things deteriorated rapidly today. After blasting through several levels of resistance we have been tracking as shown in the chart here S&amp;P 500 stalled at 3210 and plunged 5.9% today through 3115 support/resistance and closed just below 3010 support/resistance which sits at the 2019 summer highs. The next major support level below here is 2725 right near where the 50-day moving average turned up in mid-May, which would be a 15.7% correction from the recent recovery high reached this past Monday, June 8.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7d877af1643a7342c0c8622cbc763c92/eb566818257f08b5-2b/s500x750/8228cad8989a5456266c3f0d753168c4d3c3efec.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Ned Davis Research bull and bear market definitions:\n\n&gt; A cyclical bull market requires a 30% rise in the DJIA after 50 calendar days or a 13% rise after 155 calendar days. Reversals of 30% in the Value Line Geometric Index since 1965 also qualify. A cyclical bear market requires a 30% drop in the DJIA after 50 calendar days or a 13% decline after 145 calendar days. Reversals in the Value Line Geometric Index also qualify. Bull and bear markets are measured at peak and trough dates, so both the time and price criteria must be met as of the peak and trough dates.\n\n*****\n\n# More Volatility Likely During June Options Expiration Week and Beyond\n\n&gt; The second Triple Witching Week (Quadruple Witching if you prefer) of the year brings on some volatile trading with losses frequently exceeding gains. NASDAQ has the weakest record on the first trading day of the week. Triple-Witching Friday is usually better, DJIA has been up ten of the last seventeen years.\n\n&gt; Full-week performance is choppy as well, littered with greater than 1% moves in both directions. The week after Triple-Witching Day is horrendous. This week has experienced DJIA losses in 26 of the last 30 years with an average decline of 1.07%. S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have fared slightly better during the week after over the same 30-year span, declining 0.72% and 0.23% respectively on average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cbdc17aecf40cbf412100049a35e7f1b/4c6fa6c95e723529-93/s500x750/0bd7385e1b398b3c223892fe86cd1886d41bc9fd.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8de0bdcd706b729d7e5ebe8fd92670b9/4c6fa6c95e723529-e7/s500x750/fa1a12f3de57328b97c1f4f5a274d24e94fd19de.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/09c9ca9d3a0502b4a8d97976bd73366e/4c6fa6c95e723529-cf/s500x750/498b4d398dde04ebb764b72d962aa53378b29260.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending June 12th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Vn8EIUmbU))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 6.14.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w2a_gQvLdg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$KR** \n&gt; * **$MFA** \n&gt; * **$GRPN** \n&gt; * **$JKS** \n&gt; * **$ORCL** \n&gt; * **$LEN** \n&gt; * **$KMX** \n&gt; * **$TSQ** \n&gt; * **$HRB** \n&gt; * **$MPAA** \n&gt; * **$SWBI** \n&gt; * **$CMC** \n&gt; * **$RGS** \n&gt; * **$TTM** \n&gt; * **$HOME** \n&gt; * **$JBL** \n&gt; * **$DBI** \n&gt; * **$AMSWA** \n&gt; * **$ABM** \n&gt; * **$BNGO** \n&gt; * **$CNTG** \n&gt; * **$LMB** \n&gt; * **$LIVX** \n&gt; * **$ALYA** \n&gt; * **$GAN** \n&gt; * **$INWK** \n&gt; * **$VOLT** \n&gt; * **$UROV** \n&gt; * **$VNCE**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/vM5brmK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/l3jztzJ.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.15.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/shKM8RG.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.16.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PYffarr.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0uE8QeB.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/bNd3sxx.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HdpyR9B.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.18.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DNsufe6.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.19.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FHBG6yj.png))\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.19.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Kroger Co. $32.26\n&gt; **Kroger Co.

        "selftext": "\nEarlier today, I read through the interesting post created by u/oneofthephams. I can't say enough how refreshing it was to read a different type of DD post on this sub. Anyway, keep up the great work!\n\nI had also noticed the Belafonte lyrics accompanying the Izea countdown posts. u/oneofthephams post inspired me to dig a little deeper. \n\nI'll start by saying that this post is for entertainment purposes! Do not use this information as DD or a basis for making an investment decision. This was scraped together in a short period of time while hanging out this evening.\n\nInitially, I was hung up on the Belafonte lyrics on the Izea countdown. When I took a step back and shifted focus, I noticed their was a similar use of a countdown style post by both Izea and Trident. Also, the countdown images posted by Izea contain a silhouette in the shape of what looks awfully similar to the shape of the new Trident product announced in their countdown ad.\n\nInstagram: @tridentgum, countdown post for release of a new product which was referenced by Izea:\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CAOC4rgFEJu/?igshid=aan6mlsbi543\n\nInstagram: @izea, similar use of a countdown post as Trident (shape of silhouette behind number looks similar to the container used for the new release by Trident - sour berry twist. I know what you're thinking, \"that's the silhouette shape of the Izea logo\". Well, you'd be right. No need to poke a hole in a theory if it's been done for you lol. I still like the gum connection:\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CBQQKoblqGF/?igshid=a61e35lod3of\n\nWho owns Trident gum? Fortune 500 company Mondelez! Could they be the new Fortune 500 company that Izea plans to announce a partnership with?\n\nhttps://www.mondelezinternational.com/Our-Brands/Trident\n\nLet's get weird and go out on an even bigger stretch for the fun of it as reinforcement for this PURELY SPECULATIVE THEORY FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES... \n\nWhat's with the Harry Belafonte lyrics? Who knows. Maybe nothing. But the name...what's in a name? Here is mention of both Trident gum and Harry Belafonte on the same page of the November 4th, 1985 edition of New York Magazine:\n\nhttps://books.google.ca/books?id=7McBAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=harry+belafonte+trident+gum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0qmZ9jfA0N&amp;sig=ACfU3U3uvICUMLmDyROISeJnwmKAgA5Jtg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj8lP6Ys_jpAhWPHjQIHbpCB2gQ6AEwAHoECAQQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=harry%20belafonte%20trident%20gum&amp;f=false\n\nSo, Harry Belafonte was seemingly the talk of the town in 1985. What did he have going on that year you might ask? Well, he had a TV special called 'Harry Belafonte in concert' (perhaps he performed 'Jump in line', though I wasn't able to confirm). That's cool, but where's the connection you ask? Who else was popular during that period and happened to be a cast member on that TV special? None other than Bill Cosby! https://m.imdb.com/title/tt2706142/\n\nPrior to being convicted as a sex offender, Bill Cosby was a celebrity spokesperson for Kraft Foods and Jell-O for many years. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Cosby_in_advertising\n\nLet's focus less on Bill Cosby and more on Jell-O. In August of 2011, Kraft Foods announced plans to split into 2 publicly traded companies, an international snack-food company and a North American grocery company. The snack-food company, MONDELEZ INTERNATIONAL, would be the legal successor of Kraft Foods. The grocery company became a new company called Kraft Foods Group. The split was completed in August 2012. Kraft Foods Group would later merge with Heinz to become Kraft Heinz. One of the products in their portfolio is, you guessed it, Jell-O:\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Heinz\n\nAnother note of interest:\n\nMay 21, 2020\n\nKellogg\u2019s Rice Krispies identified by IZEA as 2020\u2019s \u201cMost Influential Cold Cereal Brand\u201d\n\nIZEA\u2019s BrandGraph\u00ae Platform Reveals the Cold Cereal Brand that Controls 26% of the Influencer Share of Voice for Content Volume:\n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/05/21/2036975/0/en/Kellogg-s-Rice-Krispies-identified-by-IZEA-as-2020-s-Most-Influential-Cold-Cereal-Brand.html\n\nWho is one of Kellogg's top rivals? That's right...Mondelez International. Another big player in the food sector who is also a Fortune 500 company? General Mills. \n\nPerhaps one of these companies saw value in a partnership to gain a strategic edge amongst their competitors. Based on the initial line of my ridiculous theory, my guess would be Mondelez.\n\nInteresting to note regarding Mondelez:\n\nCHICAGO, June 10, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mondel\u0113z International, Inc. (NASDAQ: MDLZ) announced that Glen Walter, Executive Vice President and President, North America, will present at the Evercore ISI Virtual Consumer &amp; Retail Summit, on June 16 at 8:00 a.m. ET.\n\nhttps://ir.mondelezinternational.com/news-releases/news-release-details/mondelez-international-present-evercore-isi-virtual-consumer\n\nThat's all for now! Hope you've had a good laugh. I sure did while trying to draw thin parallels from the cryptic social media posts by Izea. \n\nI'm fully prepared to receive negative comments on this post when the news comes out of the actual partner. If you get bent out of shape, you missed the point. This was for fun and wasn't based on any real evidence to suggest any of this is remotely close to being an educated guess.\n\nHowever, if I'm right? Well damn, I guess I'll continue to carry out this sort of bizarre investigative approach! Haha\n\nTake care!",

        "selftext": "Let's try to answer this question !\n\n**Who ?**\n\n\u00ab Wirecard is an international supplier of electronic payment and risk management services. Wirecard offers products and services in the areas of [mobile payments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_payment), [e-commerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce), [digitization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digitization) and finance technology. This traditionally comprises the integration of payment methods, payment transactions via e-commerce as well as payment transactions at the stationary checkout ([POS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_sale)). In these areas, Wirecard currently works in cooperation with 280,000 companies (as of December 2018), including [Allianz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allianz), [KLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KLM), [Qatar Airways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar_Airways),[Rakuten.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakuten.com) and [Transport for London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_for_London), among others. The transaction volume in 2018 was US$125 billion. In the first half of 2019 the transaction volume grew by 37.5 percent to EUR 77.3 billion. \u00bb Wikipedia \n\n**Shareholders ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rzpbs9z98q551.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e65866db19ca77189d307e4f61b528e538b7f374\n\n**Creditors :**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Deutsche Bank took half of Markus shares as a collateral for a loan of 150m \u20ac to Markus not Wirecard\n\n**Market share ?** \n\nThose are the countries using the most Wirecard :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wl1tg5xa8q551.png?width=416&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69082fc467534b0a127e1d42deefff048a4a9824\n\nMarket shares of the European competitors : \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fsz15v5c8q551.png?width=1994&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30d876934f7ee8734a3a58f2c219a05e95d9ba0c\n\n*Side note* : Amongst international competitors there arePaypal, Visa, Apple Pay \u2026\n\n**What happened ?**\n\nAll really begun with this 59 pages report written by KPMG ([https://www.wirecard.com/uploads/Bericht\\_Sonderpruefung\\_KPMG\\_EN\\_200501\\_Disclaimer.pdf](https://www.wirecard.com/uploads/Bericht_Sonderpruefung_KPMG_EN_200501_Disclaimer.pdf)) concerning a forensic special investigation on Wirecard, which basically mean that they are investigating about a **specific case** with the aim of fully clarifying a potential (not necessarily criminally relevant) violation or misconduct, so this is not a annual audit.\n\nIn this report, KPMG complained about the lack of will of Wirecard to give informations, KPMG was unable to obtain standard information that it requested from Wirecard such as bank statements, customer names and contracts as well as transaction data.\n\nThis document was the main reason of the Chris Hohn\u2019s open letter. The famous hedge fund manager published an open letter on April 28 to Thomas Eichelmann, the chairman of Wirecard ([https://www.tcifund.com/files/corporateengageement/wirecard/TCI%20-%20Letter%20to%20Wirecard%2028%20April%202020.pdf](https://www.tcifund.com/files/corporateengageement/wirecard/TCI%20-%20Letter%20to%20Wirecard%2028%20April%202020.pdf)).\n\nIn his letter, he states the audit made by KPMG was inconclusive, \u00ab KPMG explains that it has encountered an \u201cUntersuchungshemmnis\u201d (in English: obstacles to the investigation) \u00bb, basically, 1 billion $ was missing between 2016 and 2018. So it raises questions to how investors, lenders and regulators can be confident that Wirecard\u2019s current and historic accounting is accurate, so they wanted for Wirecard to show some trust by firing Markus the CEO, but today he is still here. He concluded by announcing that he was short selling 1.04% of shares outstanding of Wirecard.\n\n**Since then :** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* TILP filed an investor lawsuit. The lawsuit claims that the KPMG report showed that the group for years had experienced a massive shortfall in compliance\u009d that it had been obliged to disclose to shareholders early on. Why is it important ? Because this law firm has already won cases against Porsche and Volkswagen during the diesel gate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Al Alam a Dubai business payment processor their most significant business partner entered liquidation on May 2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Today the stock dropped 61% and their bonds by more than 40% because EY which was conducting an annual audit said that they were unable to confirm the existence of 2.1b $, and that \u00ab  spurious cash balance \u00bb have been provided to auditor by 3rd party. This missing fund represents 25% of the company. They have to come clean by tomorrow (June 18).\n\n**Conclusion :**\n\nConsidering the online payment business as fast very forward industry, Wirecard is facing two challenges :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* First, they will need to find a managerial equilibrium in a short time\n* Second, they will need earn back trust from current clients and future ones. They may loose more clients in the short term.\n\nThose challenges are actually very hard to tackle in an healthy market but in this one it seems nearly impossible, furthermore, big investors will be selling massively those next few days so we might see more loses.\n\n**I am not a financial advisor but I would say that in the long and short term the stock is going down as well as the company.**",

        "selftext": "**Disclaimer:** I took a position in KBLM (warrants) today. This post is a summary of the DD I did beforehand.\n\n**About the SPAC:**\nName: KBL Merger Corp. IV\nIPO: June, 2017 - $100M\nLeadership team:\n* CEO: Marlene Krauss, M.D. *Previously CEO and Chairman of three KBL SPACs - KBL Healthcare I, II, and III., B.A. Cornell University, M.D. Harvard Medical School, M.B.A. Harvard Business School (Alumni Achievement Award; Dean's Committee).*\n* Chairman: George Hornig. *CEO of RON Transatlantic Financial Holdings, Former COO of Pine Bridge Investments, Credit Suisse Asset Management and Deutsche Bank (Americas), A.B., M.B.A., and J.D. Harvard University.*\n* COO: Joseph A. Williamson *Managing Partner at JAW Capital, Chairman of National Home Care Holdings, Previously co-founder and President of Concord Health Group acquired by KBL Acquisition I and subsequently sold to MultiCare.*\n* The team also has [four scientific advisors with impressive backgrounds](https://kblmerger.com/our-team). This is the first healthcare/biotech SPAC I've invested in, so I'm not sure whether this is normal, but it impressed me that they have just as many scientific advisors as they do directors.\n\n[Here is a video about Dr. Krauss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OWCcnN0J-s) from Harvard Business School's YouTube channel. My takeaway was that she's been a lifelong overachiever in school and in business, knows the healthcare industry/investments inside and out, and comes across as a very geniune person.\n\n**About the target:**\n[CannBioRx](https://cannbiorx.com)\n\nOfficers and Directors:\n* Co-Chairman: [Prof Sir Marc Feldmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Feldmann). His wikipedia says it all.\n* Co-Chairman: [Prof Lawrence Steinman](http://med.stanford.edu/steinmanlab/lawrence_steinman.html) *Professor of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Pediatrics, and Genetics.  He also served as the Chair of the Stanford University Interdepartmental Program in Immunology from 2003-2011.*\n* CEO and CSO: Dr Jonathan Rothbard. [Here is a podcast interview he did last month](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LylpAGuSuHI). Funny story @9:15 when he starts talking about his background.\n\nThere are three CannBioRx group companies:\n**[Katexco Pharmaceuticals](https://cannbiorx.com/katexco/)** - *A second-generation pharmaceutical cannabis company targeting autoimmune diseases by a variety of approaches, including utilizing CBD or related compounds, or CB2 agonists. The company will be targeting multi-billion-dollar markets of multiple sclerosis, gastrointestinal disorders, gout, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and atherosclerosis.* This one sounds the most promising of the three to me. I also found this quote from an [interview with Dr. Rothbard about Katexco](https://thriveglobal.com/stories/the-future-of-healthcare-a-second-generation-of-fda-approved-medical-cannabis-with-dr-jonathan-rothbard/): *\"Katexco is developing cannabis-derived treatments through clinical trials that will eventually be submitted to the FDA, including the world\u2019s first drug to exploit a key receptor on immune cells in the brain with the ability to treat inflammatory diseases like Crohn\u2019s disease, gout and multiple sclerosis\"*\n**[CannBioRex](https://cannbiorx.com/cannbiorex/)** - *pioneer in the field of synthetic non-psychoactive cannabinoids, and the result of a twenty-year collaboration between Professor Sir Marc Feldmann and Professor Raphael Mechoulam, who is a leading expert in cannabis chemistry and successfully identified THC, CBD, and endocannabinoids.* This sentence in particular jumped out at me: *Despite roughly 3,000 pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies existing globally, there are only a handful of companies actively developing synthetic cannabinoids for human and veterinary health.* Like Katexco, this also sounds very promising. The name choice is confusing... it's identical to the parent company except for the 'e' in the name.\n**[180 Theraputics](https://cannbiorx.com/therapeutics/)** - I'll save you the summary, this one does not sound very promising. They have one project targeting treating early-stage fibrosis of the hand. They also have **plans** for a trial to treat frozen shoulder, which affects up to 2% of the population. That's it.\n\n**My cons:**\n* It's been 3 years since the KBLM IPO was completed, and 11 months since they announced their target. We're obviously getting down to crunch time here.\n* The cannabis industry as a whole is still toxic to investors right now. I think a lot of people see Cannabis in a press release and immediately move on these days.\n\n**My pros:**\n* The leadership team of both the SPAC and target seem excellent. Very long track records.\n* Even though I listed the fact that the SPAC is in crunch time as a con, it's my opinion that these warrants are severely undervalued. There is \n* [They sweetened the pot on March 24th](https://spacinsider.com/2020/03/24/kblm-offering-very-attractive-extension-contribution/). The COVID lockdowns were only a week or two old at the time and the market was tanking (like I need to tell you guys). Perhaps they were ready to move forward with a vote but chose to delay until July thinking the business climate would improve / things would be somewhat back to normal. This might just be wishful thinking on my part, but why bother sweetening the pot for non-redeemers if they felt the deal was on thin ice?\n* Their vote is scheduled for July 9th. I don't like holding warrants forever!\n\nI'd like to hear everyone's thoughts on this one. When I posted about it in the weekly thread this morning I was surprised how many people are holding it... I had yet to see KBLM talked about here.",

        "selftext": "I am posting my portfolio and strategies here to gain insight and hopefully learn from those that are much smarter than I am. Please be critical and constructive! \n\nI have decided to split my cash into two portfolios: core holdings and secondary portfolio which has a worth of 50% of my core holdings portfolio (150% total).\n\nThese are my targets for my core holdings portfolio:\n\n|Canadian Utilities (CU)|10.53%|\n|:-|:-|\n|Enbridge (ENB)|10.53%|\n|TD Bank (TD)|13.16%|\n|Canada West Bank (CWB)|13.16%|\n|Northwest Healthcare Properties REIT (NWH)|10.53%|\n|Riocan (REI)|21.05%|\n|Telus (T)|10.53%|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The reason I am drawn to these companies:\n   * I wanted to set up a dividend portfolio in my TFSA and reinvest dividends via DRIPs. These companies had high yields back in March when the pandemic hit and I saw an opportunity to lock in high yields with big, relatively safe Canadian companies that are an integral part of our economy. \n   * Other companies that I considered and may go back to:\n      * Financials: CIX, because it dropped harder than the banks and looking at the charts, I am expecting a breakout soon. I also considered all the other 5 big banks but went with TD due to their exposure to the US market. \n      * REITs: BPY, HR-UN. I am desperate to save enough money to open a DRIP with HR REIT. I believe they are undervalued according to their balance sheets and I did pick up a few shares at $8.20 and wish I had more cash to pour into it at that time. \n      * Communications: RCI, BCE, but decided on Telus due to their EMR market share. Also having first hand experience - their EMR is extremely user friendly and maintenance and administration is cheaper and easier than OSCAR based systems. This is especially true for rural communities with an aging population since all those patients still carry flip phones and most just rely on their landline. Using Facetime or smartphone based tech makes them uncomfortable. Seeing the system in action during this lockdown, especially how well it works with a work from home model has increased my liking for the company since everything is integrated into the EMR. The main problem with OSCAR systems is that not all hospitals are compatible with it and syncing medical records across two different systems is a pain. Telus has made their system compatible with a lot of rural hospitals and thus been able to connect the doctors offices with their local hospitals. \n      * I also considered Northwest Company, and in the future, when I have enough saved for a DRIP, I will be adding that to my TFSA also. The reasoning behind this is they have captured a niche market and are serving underserved areas and developing reliance on their product. The strength of this company is reflected in its' aggressive V-shaped recovery during the pandemic. \n      * I may also swap out ENB for AltaGas, but for now I am comfortable holding ENB at least for a year or so to see how it reacts to the market while I collect dividends. Though, eventually I'd like to transition out of oil and into renewable energy or possibly hold both at the same time depending on my cash at hand. \n* Currently I am DCA-ing my way into the positions of my core holdings. I have currently invested 50% of my total core holdings budget and have a remaining 50% currently sitting as cash, waiting to be deployed. I know everyone says you can't time the market and that's the reason I have decided to DCA - however, I feel like the current rally in markets is premature and a correction is on the horizon which is why I have paused my DCA contributions for now. I want to spread the money out for a longer period of time, possibly past September and into November and possibly even into December. \n* This is where I have my first question - am I just being overly speculative and cautious? Should I just blindly buy stocks systematically every two weeks or is my strategy to pause contributions viable? I found that I ended up DCA-ing upwards as the markets have rallied and missed out on opportunities which I wouldn't have missed out on if I had invested as a lump sum in March. \n* My secondary portfolio is a bit less organized. I have used this portfolio to buy and hold for a few days and then take profits. So basically swing trading, but I wish I had more cash so I could have held on to some of these for longer and bought them earlier. Here are a few trades that I made in the past:\n   * ATE.V: I've been holding this since early April. Currently sitting on about 500 shares. I believe in the product but boy, has management really been bad with communicating with their share holders. Its a long term play, and management has a decent strategy going forward and I will continue to hold unless the company shows signs of completely tanking. \n   * QSR: Bought and sold, made a few bucks in profit in early march. Never intended to hold this long term but I may reevaluate that in the future. Long term I would have to decide between this or A &amp; W income fund.\n   * ATZ: made a tidy profit off Aritizia too, looking to re enter possibly next quarter.\n   * ROOT: Same as ATZ. No intention of reentry. \n   * CGX: bought when it was around $12 and sold when it hit $14. No intention of reentry.\n   * MIR.V: made a 50% (FIFTY!) profit but only had about $50 to put in initially. Cashed out at $80. I want to re enter with about $1K on this.\n   * HR-UN: Yeah, I swing (swung?) traded a REIT. Bought at $8.20 and sold at $10.20 Would have liked to hold it longer but wanted to free up cash. Looking to re enter next quarter. \n   * BMO: So basically I had about $1K sitting in cash and BMO was lagging the other banks as the sector was recovering so I bought as much as I could. Now I feel trapped since I got a great deal at around $61 and am considering moving this to my core holdings, but I already have enough financial sector exposure in my core portfolio. I am up around 20% and feel like if I hold I can make more profit. I am also, at the same time, very tempted to liquidate and carry the funds forward into my future investments which I will highlight below. Any thoughts on strategy regarding this would be appreciated. \n* Future investments in my secondary portfolio:\n   * Currently I'm working on a strategy to invest with my secondary portfolio. Basically I just need to decide cut down this list to about 4-6 companies and decide on entry points:\n      * [WELL](https://WELL.TO)\n      * ATZ\n      * GOOS\n      * BB\n      * FLT\n      * LSPD\n      * CSH-UN\n      * HR-UN\n      * MIR.V\n      * I am also looking at the following but would need to research more and drop some other tickers to pick these up: SVI, PLC, TFII\n   * Basically, I am looking for value and growth in these companies and looking to enter with about $1k for each. Personally I am very drawn towards WELL, ATZ, GOOS, MIR, LSPD and CSH-UN\n* Another question I had was if I am swing trading, should I not do that in my TFSA? I can liquidate a few positions and put them into a taxable account just for swing trading. I would leave my secondary portfolio in my TFSA as a growth only portfolio and separate some funds solely for swing trading (basically play money). \n* Am I better off just converting my cash to USD and investing in TSLA, BRK.B, and Apple, AMD, etc?\n* The reason I am waiting for next quarter to re enter is because I fully believe there will be a market correction and a possible second downturn due to requirements for emergency subsidies being tightened up. The government can only sustain this for so long. Secondly, I don't think losses will be fully realized until next quarter. Thirdly, there is a possibility for a credit crisis and the big banks are fully expecting this which is why they increased their loss provisions according to the latest financial reports. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd now the age old question - \"Why not just buy a couple of ETfs and forget about it?\"\n\nI strongly considered XDV, XDIV, XEI as the majority investments in my core holdings along with a few exposure ETF's like TEC, VHT, some international exposure and small cap value ETFs.   \n\n\nWhy did I decide against it? I feel like ETFs offer less value when it comes to value investing. Sure, they dropped in price when the markets went down but I still feel like the rebound is dampened (as are the drops) which is to be expected because the risk is also lower. However, if I invest $1K into WELL for example, I will receive 100% of the value when it pops up, whereas if I purchase a small cap health/tech ETF which includes WELL,  the ETF would probably return much less value to me, not to mention that during re-balancing, the fund manager could classify WELL to be a large cap company and balance the company out of the ETF since it doesn't meet the requirements anymore and I would have to live with that decision, or go out and buy it but at that point I'd have missed out on most of the growth. \n\nSecondly, I found that most ETFs that hold Canadian banks have a lower dividend yield than if I had just held the banks directly. Granted, it wouldn't be at the same weight and I would probably only hold one or two banks instead of all 5 via an ETF but I don't really care for holding all 5 and especially so if the dividend yield is higher. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore I started investing, I paper traded for years just out of curiosity and I was always interested in stock prices. I did a lot of research and learning before starting to invest and felt like I knew what I was doing. Now I feel like I have no idea what I am doing (lol). My goal for the next year or so is to try and fully understand options trading in order to make weekly income, paper trade and develop a strategy and by next March start options trading. Currently learning about the wheel strategy and am really excited about trying it out. \n\nI also want to gain US market exposure, namely in the tech sector. I feel like a lot of growth is to be had there.\n\nPlease let me know what you think! I need to know where I stand with my investment strategy. Constructive criticism is most welcome!",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve been doing some research and noticed that in regards to a lot of the swings associated with COVID-19, some of the biggest losses are immediately followed big gains, only to have even bigger losses, sometimes in back to back days. For instance:\n\n(Numbers slightly rounded for convenience)\n\n03/09 DJIA dropped -2,000 (total loss 2,000)\n03/10 DJIA jumped +1,100 (total loss 900)\n03/11 DJIA dropped -1,400 (total loss 2,300)\n03/12 DJIA dropped -2,300 (total loss 4,600)\n03/13 DJIA jumped +1,900 (total loss 2,700)\n03/16 DJIA dropped -3,000 (total loss 5,700)\n\n*03-16 was the Monday immediately following the last market close, so still \u201cback-to-back\u201d technically\n\nOverall, a lot of the DJIA biggest ever point changes were bounces back after huge losses. Yesterday ranks as the 4th largest single point loss in Dow History. So a large correction in the opposite would be expected, given the current pattern witnessed. \n\nGranted the markets are volatile as hell as it is, but given what I\u2019ve seen I\u2019m betting on a bounce up today, probably in the 700-800 range followed by a large correction Monday. \n\nA lot of things went into play during this time frame and I\u2019m well aware of that, and I\u2019m looking at mainly just the swings themselves and may not be taking all variables into consideration (almost impossible to do). However, I am curious about others thoughts on this subject. \n\nAm I just being bearish in this mindset, or is the market set for another correction now that the fed has stated they expect the recovery to last a lot longer and not be as much of a \u201cV\u201d shape recovery?

Looking at the all-time data for V &amp; MA, neither particularly falter at any point, which in conjunction with reading the risks section of both companies' 10-Ks, makes me think they're both reasonably safe investments.

        "selftext": "I am new and am trying to learn about reading candlestick charts. Im confused and cant seem to find a good video that explains the interpretation properly. \n\nSo i understand that a candlestick shows high low open close and whether the day was bullish or bearish. I am trying to understand how to better interpet wick length as compared to body. Basically, my interpretation is the following: \n\n* Bullish day with a long upper wick and small bottom wick: To me, this means that sellers tried to push the price higher and succeeded up to a certain point but failed. Buyers thought that the stock was not worth that much so buyers pushed the price down.\n* Bullish day with a short upper wick and a long bottom wick: To me, this means that buyers tried to push the price low but failed. Sellers kept the price higher. \n* Bearish day long upper wick small bottom wick: To me this means again sellers tried to push the price higher but ultimately they failed and buyers controlled the price and pushed it down.\n* Bearish day short upper wick long bottom wick: To me, this means again that sellers brought the price down significantly, but sellers ultimately took control and brought the price back up.\n\nAll in all, my interpretations of the candlesticks are based on the fact thought that: buyers will want the price to be lower so they get the stock cheap, and sellers will want the price higher so they can keep profits. \n\nI decided to check out this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3KRwfj9F8Q&amp;t=312s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3KRwfj9F8Q&amp;t=312s) and apparently my interpretation is completely wrong. At 4:11 he basically says a short upper wick on a bullish day with a long body, basically means buyers had control that day and had \"weak price rejection\". Similarly he says a long upper wick means \"strong price rejection\" and that the sellers were in control. \n\nHow does that make sense? wouldn't a seller want to sell as high as possible, and a buyer buy as low as possible?",

        "selftext": "In this post I want to break down the Cash Covered Put. A strategy I have used for the last 2 months-ish to make a decent amount of money with. My biggest winner has been with American Airlines, and I never owned a single share. What do you think of this strategy?\n\nProfits from AAL: $183\n\nTotal Profits from Theta Strategies: $374\n\nAccount Value: $3000 thus roughly \\~12% Gain\n\nCCP=Cash Covered Put; CC=Covered Call; PCS=Put Credit Spread\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yx91j4xl1x451.png?width=2076&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=411ec824c568cf7d880b23bcbaf16d057f19b71a\n\nCash Covered Put\n\n* In this strategy we won\u2019t be buying put options, but instead we will be selling put options for premium\n* Remember, a put option gives the buyer the right to sell 100 shares of a stock at a certain strike price on or before the expiration day\n\nNow let\u2019s break down a Cash Covered Put:\n\n* Just like a typical Put option you have 3 parts to it: Strike Price, Premium, and Expiration Date\n* The key part of a Cash Covered Put is having enough money to buy 100 shares\n* Because by selling a put you are agreeing to a contract to buy the shares at the strike price and in return you get paid premium for this obligation\n* Having Cash available is key here because the whole idea behind this is if the price falls below the agreed upon strike price then you will be \u201cassigned\u201d shares aka forced to buy the shares at the agreed upon strike price.\n* Being forced to buy shares is the obligation you accepted when you chose to sell puts.\n* If you don\u2019t have the full cash amount available then you will be taking on those shares in margin, which I don\u2019t recommend unless you are an advanced investor. Just like margin can amplify gains it can amplify losses.\n* Now what is the goal here? \n   * The goal of selling puts is to collect premium. This strategy allows you to make money without ever owning the stock OR collect money as you wait for the stock\u2019s price to come down and you get assigned at the strike price you sold.\n\n[Cash Covered Puts Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDpMKDZdJe4)",

        "selftext": "**Investing guide**\n\n**Preface: Why I made this**\u00a0\n\nLet\u2019s start this guide off with an honest truth: I spend an unhealthy amount of time on Youtube. Whether it\u2019s watching Japanese sumo championships, video games I don\u2019t even play, or Mike Tyson absolutely annihilating anyone unlucky enough to box him: I love it all. Thankfully, some of my time has been put to good use. Over the past several years I have learned nearly everything I know about investing, almost exclusively through the platform, and that has changed my life. I have been investing in ETFs for the past 5 years, picking individual stocks for 2, and as of today (June 10, 2020) my portfolio is up over 60% overall. Investing, to me, is the path to financial freedom. The key to spending my life the way I desire and never needing to worry about money or slaving away at a job I don\u2019t enjoy.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ve been interested in investing since high school but I only just started recently because I had no clue where to begin, and entering the investing world intimidated the hell out of me. The education system provided me next to nothing in terms of personal finance, and anyone actually talking about it seemed like some sleaze bag that wanted to sell me something.\n\nI made this guide for anyone feeling that exact same way: I decided to slog through all the books and the hundreds of investment videos I have watched over the years to make a structured list of videos and personal notes that will give anyone, completely for free, the tools they need to begin investing and to succeed in creating wealth over the long term.\u00a0\n\n**Disclaimer:**\u00a0\n\nGetting through this guide will not be easy. At times it will suck, it will be boring, and it will be wildly time consuming. I have included many hours of videos and I expect you to watch each one. I want to be clear: If you cannot sit through a 45 minute video on how to learn to invest, then I would seriously reconsider investing at all. Patience is just as key in the markets as it is in learning new skills.\u00a0\n\nI encourage you to use this guide as an education tool, but not as the definitive answer for how to invest. It is undoubtedly prone to my personal bias and my style of investing, which may or may not not fit your own. Nothing in the investment world is gospel and it is imperative to develop your own strategies, to stay humble, and to continue educating yourself.\n\nHowever, I do believe this guide should provide you with everything you need to begin investing and to be successful in the long term. Most, but not all, of the links provided reflect my own personal investment style, but occasionally I will present several different ideas and allow you to decide what is best for your own portfolio. Almost all of the linked videos are by amazing Youtubers that have tons of additional content, each of them with their own strategies, opinions, and expertise. Check them out.\u00a0\n\nIf you decide you are ready to begin investing I have included my three brokerage recommendations at the bottom of the guide.

Covid has taught us that it is IMPERATIVE for a company to have cash on hand that can cover its short term debt obligations for a bare minimum of 1 quarter with no income. Some concepts in this video are pretty advanced, what I recommend is to \u2014at least\u2014 know how much cash the company currently has on hand in comparison to their current debt. This can be done on yahoo finance by looking at the company's balance sheet.\n\nIf the company has significantly more debt than cash on hand then you need to figure out how much of that debt is short term (due within the next 12 months). If their cash on hand cannot cover that debt, then this company is an extremely risky investment. If this company is forced to shut down for any reason and cannot gain profitable revenue then in-order to avoid bankruptcy they will be required to take out more debt (which will be lent at extremely unfavorable rates) or to issue more shares to avoid bankruptcy. This issuance will dilute the share count and hurt current investors, also the issued shares will be sold at current market price which is likely to be a very low price for the company.\u00a0\n\nBankruptcy totally wipes out the investor and your stock position will go to 0 as the company sells off its assets to pay off bond investors. If the company's assets value are above what they owe to bond holders then the remaining value will be distributed to shareholders.\u00a0\n\n[The Cost of Share Dilution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHAM0VSkqQg) \\-\u00a0\n\nShare dilution explained\n\n**Should I invest now or wait?**\n\n[A WARNING for ALL Investors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhYZU5uXmf4) \\-\u00a0\n\nTime in the market beats timing the market\n\n[The Best Investing Advice of 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKmJNvSvmKw) \\-\u00a0\n\nSame concept - you cannot time the market\u00a0\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqqfltv\\_cSI&amp;list=WL&amp;index=40&amp;t=0s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqqfltv_cSI&amp;list=WL&amp;index=40&amp;t=0s) \\-\u00a0\n\nExamination of the global economy using manufacturing numbers to consider the possibility of market recovery / another crash\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g32q6e3KZ5c&amp;t=320s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g32q6e3KZ5c&amp;t=320s) \\-\u00a0\n\nPresents the idea that holding dividend paying stocks and companies that continue to grow is more powerful than holding a cash position\u00a0\n\n[Waiting to Invest is Costing You...

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve been doing some research and noticed that in regards to a lot of the swings associated with COVID-19, some of the biggest losses are immediately followed big gains, only to have even bigger losses, sometimes in back to back days. For instance:\n\n(Numbers slightly rounded for convenience)\n\n03/09 DJIA dropped -2,000 (total loss 2,000)\n03/10 DJIA jumped +1,100 (total loss 900)\n03/11 DJIA dropped -1,400 (total loss 2,300)\n03/12 DJIA dropped -2,300 (total loss 4,600)\n03/13 DJIA jumped +1,900 (total loss 2,700)\n03/16 DJIA dropped -3,000 (total loss 5,700)\n\n*03-16 was the Monday immediately following the last market close, so still \u201cback-to-back\u201d technically\n\nOverall, a lot of the DJIA biggest ever point changes were bounces back after huge losses. Yesterday ranks as the 4th largest single point loss in Dow History. So a large correction in the opposite would be expected, given the current pattern witnessed. \n\nGranted the markets are volatile as hell as it is, but given what I\u2019ve seen I\u2019m betting on a bounce up today, probably in the 700-800 range followed by a large correction Monday. \n\nA lot of things went into play during this time frame and I\u2019m well aware of that, and I\u2019m looking at mainly just the swings themselves and may not be taking all variables into consideration (almost impossible to do). However, I am curious about others thoughts on this subject. \n\nAm I just being bearish in this mindset, or is the market set for another correction now that the fed has stated they expect the recovery to last a lot longer and not be as much of a \u201cV\u201d shape recovery?  Those of you who are much more experienced in this subject and have time to do more DD and analysis, please let me know your thoughts.",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 8th, 2020.\n\n# **Look for the S&amp;P 500 to turn positive for the year with a boost from the Fed in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/05/look-for-the-sp-500-to-turn-positive-for-the-year-with-a-boost-from-the-fed-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to reassure markets next week the central bank will do whatever it takes to help the economy heal. That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting is the big event for markets in the coming week. There are a few economic reports, including inflation data, the consumer price index Wednesday and producer prices Thursday. Weekly jobless claims will be important Thursday to see if there\u2019s a drop in continuing clams, after May\u2019s employment report showed a surprising record gain of 2.5 million jobs.\n*****\n&gt; The reopening trade was in full swing in the past week, especially Friday when stocks surged on the jobs report, which was expected to show a loss of 8.3 million jobs. The Nasdaq broke above its record high set on Feb. 19, and the S&amp;P 500 was just 1.1% away from turning positive for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Even before the jobs report, investors were loading up on financials, industrials, transports and small caps, which were up more than 8% for the week and 18.4% in the past month. S&amp;P financials were 12.1% higher on the week, S&amp;P industrials were up 10.5, and the NYSE airline index jumped more than 35.4.%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think next week is dominated by the reopening and it will be for another month,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. \u201cWith cyclicals outperforming, small [caps] outperforming, credit spreads coming in and then the bond yields going up, everybody \u2014 all facets of the financial markets \u2014 are sort of suggesting the same outcome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 3,193, a gain of 4.9%, and now traders are watching to see if it can scale the psychological 3,200 level. The Dow closed Friday at 27,110, up 6.8% for the week, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.4%, at 9,814 after reaching an intraday record high of 9,845 Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts say the market will likely look past the protests that broke out in cities across the U.S. after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Four policemen were charged with murder in his death. Looters joined the protests, some of which turned violent, but they quieted down towards the end of the week.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher for a third week in a row, but a change this past week has been the abrupt lurch higher in Treasury yields. The 10-year rose to a high of 0.95% Friday, a quarter-point move in just three sessions. The move was already underway but got a lift Wednesday when ADP jobs data was not nearly as bad as expected. Yields ripped even higher after the May employment report showed the unemployment rate actually fell to 13.3%, instead of climbing to 20%, as expected by economists.\n*****\n&gt; Bond strategists said the Treasury market was now acknowledging the potential for a recovery, but not in the exuberant way the stock market has been. Since March 23, the S&amp;P 500 has risen more than 45%, but it took the 10-year Treasury until this week to get back the yield level it was at when stocks bottomed.\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen said he believes a new bull market has been launched, but there could be pullbacks and some headwinds for the market coming up.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhen GDP is minus 30%, other issues don\u2019t matter. There\u2019s just one issue. But as the economy reopens again, the trade battles will matter again, presidential politics will matter again,\u201d said Paulsen, adding the budget deficit could also matter. \u201cI think we\u2019ll get removed from a sole focus. That isn\u2019t quite there but I think it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed begins its two-day meeting Tuesday, and will release its statement Wednesday afternoon, followed by a video briefing by Powell.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhey would the Fed want to disrupt this with anything?\u201d Paulsen said. \u201cThey\u2019re still going to support the economy. They\u2019re going to stay away from negative rates or yield curve management. They\u2019re not going to do anything to scare the markets. They might certainly reassure people that they are still ready to provide support.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America, said the Fed may clarify where it stands on some of the extraordinary moves it has taken since it cut rates to zero. The Fed has been supporting the markets with asset purchases and multiple programs for commercial paper, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds, for example.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe think right now they\u2019re just trying to get this Main Street lending program to work. The question is are they going to do more things around what they do in terms of forward guidance and next steps of macro easing,\u201d Harris said.\n*****\n&gt; There has been speculation that the Fed would do some type of so-called yield curve control, a program to keep interest rates capped at certain levels. \u201cI think it\u2019s too early for that,\u201d said Harris. He said the Fed would be guaranteeing low rates for a long period of time if it does yield curve control.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYield curve control is basically open-ended quantitative easing,\u201d he said. The Fed is currently buying Treasurys but if it wanted to stop yields from rising too much as the economy improves, it could make targeted purchases.\n*****\n&gt; Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said it\u2019s possible the Fed could announce the yield curve control. \u201cWe\u2019ve said they could implement yield curve control out to three years,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my mind that matches the length of the horizon of the economic projections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Powell has said the economy needs more fiscal help, and he could reiterate those comments Wednesday. President Donald Trump on Friday said he backs more stimulus. So far, the Democrats have put out a marker with their wish list for further spending, but there have been no negotiations.\n*****\n&gt; There was concern the strong jobs report could make it harder to get buy in for another big spending package. But some economists say the recovery needs a boost and states need funding to fill the holes in their budgets from coronavirus-related spending and a lack of tax receipts.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7klaXQm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PKTBzT2.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/a5JkAB6.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/M2x4Qoq.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qtJYfXN.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bjiJWjV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UAi19KJ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GQm4ruO.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uV1U7FN.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/wm2XJND.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yarkiMO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hFblu2G.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Stocks Outpacing Analyst Price Targets\n\n&gt; This morning's jobs report shocked the financial world -- most notably the economists whose job it is to provide estimates. The consensus estimate among economists for May nonfarm payrolls was projecting a loss of more than 7 million jobs. The actual number that was reported did not just show a smaller than expected job loss, but it actually showed a gain in jobs of more than 2.5 million.\n\n&gt; We're seeing a similar situation play out in the equity analyst community. With the S&amp;P 500 now up 40%+ since its low less than three months ago, the average stock in the index is now trading above its consensus analyst price target that looks 12 months out. Analysts have simply not been able to catch up to the rapid rise we've seen for equity prices.\n\n&gt; It's extremely rare to see share prices move above consensus analyst price targets. We don't have the historical daily data on this, but anecdotally we can't remember a time when the spread has been this wide. As shown below, at the end of 2019 when the S&amp;P finished a massive rally, equity prices were 5.5% below the consensus price target. That was seen as a very tight spread prior to what we're seeing now. At the lows in March, the average share price had dropped all the way to $92.50 compared to an average consensus price target of $143.20. That projected a gain of 54.9% at the time!\n\n&gt; Since March 23rd, the average share price has risen from $92.50 up to $138.40, while the average analyst price target has fallen from $143.20 to $136. Current price targets no longer project a gain for the average S&amp;P 500 stock, but rather a 1.7% drop.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/avgpricetarget.png))**\n\n&gt; # Nasdaq's Historical Run\n\n&gt; At its highs earlier this morning, the Nasdaq Composite was within 2% of its record high from earlier in the year. Besides the steep V-shape of the Nasdaq's pattern over the last four months, the other aspect of the chart that stands out is just how steep the 50-day moving average is trending lately.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-50DMAa.png))**\n\n&gt; To illustrate just how steep the Nasdaq's 50-DMA has become, the chart below shows the daily percentage change of the 50-day going back to 1971. Currently, the Nasdaq 50-DMA is rising at an average of over 0.5% per day. That's an incredible slope and a level that has been exceeded only a handful of times in the Nasdaq's 50-year history.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-Composite1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Big Gains From Smaller Tech\n\n&gt; It's still difficult to fathom the moves in the US equity market over the last four months. The fact that the Nasdaq and more specifically the Technology sector aren't far from record highs is definitely something no one was expecting two months ago. There's an old market saying that equities take the stairs up and the elevator down, but in the latest market cycle, the elevator up was almost as fast as the way down!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Nasdaq.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Technology-Sector.png))**\n\n&gt; If you've been following the markets, all you've likely heard up until recently is that large-cap tech, and more specifically, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Facebook (FB), are single-handedly driving the market higher. The reality is not nearly as clear-cut. Given their market caps, the \"Big 5\" (as they're often referred to) have done a lot of heavy lifting, but in terms of performance, they're hardly the only game in town.\n\n&gt; The table below lists Technology sector stocks in the Russell 3000 with market caps of more than $1 billion that are outperforming all of the 'big 5' tech stocks on a YTD basis. Actually, since Amazon is doing so well relative to the rest of the \"big 5\" these are all stocks that are outperforming Amazon. If we looked for stocks that were doing better than the average return of the \"big 5\" the list would be a lot, lot longer (+16.4%).\n\n&gt; Looking through the list of names below, the two top-performing names are Zscaler (ZS) and Twilio (TWLO), which have both more than doubled. Behind these two, DocuSign (DOCU) and Sprout Social (SPT) are both knocking on the door of triple-digits. All 28 of the names listed have market caps of $1 billion, but the average market cap is just over $21 billion, while Nvidia (NVDA) is the largest company on the list with a market cap of $216 billion. For the most part, these aren't names that have been driving the indices, but anyone holding these stocks in their portfolio probably doesn't care!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Tech-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Best 50-Day Rally Ever\n\n&gt; In many ways, what we\u2019ve seen so far in 2020 has been both record-breaking and devastating. From the S&amp;P 500 Index peak on February 19 to the bear market lows March 23, stocks lost 33.9%. Now, 50 trading days later, stocks have gained 39.6%, for the largest 50-day rally since the S&amp;P 500 moved to 500 stocks in 1957.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere are no rollercoasters that can replicate what stocks have done so far in 2020,\u201d exclaimed LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHere\u2019s the catch though: Big 50-day rallies in the past have taken place near the start of new bull markets, and the returns going out a year were quite bullish.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 39.6% gain in 50 days was the greatest 50-day rally ever, besting the previous best in October 1982. What\u2019s important to note here is that many of these rallies took place coming off major market lows, and delivered quite strong returns going out 6 to 12 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/best-fifty-days.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Although we have near-term worries given this historic run, as some sentiment indicators such as put/call ratios are showing some froth, from a bigger picture perspective, this strong 50-day rally offers a reason to think stock prices may be even higher this time next year.\n\n*****\n\n# 2020 In Charts\n\n&gt; 2020 is only five months old, but in many ways it is one of the most historic years we\u2019ve ever seen. \u201c2020 went from moving along nicely, to seeing the worst recession in a generation and the fastest bear market ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cNow stocks are in the midst of one of the best bull runs ever, even though the economy remains extremely weak, thanks to record stimulus and hopes over a vaccine.\u201d\n&gt; \nTo best sum it all up, here are 10 charts that tell the picture of 2020 so far.\n\n&gt; 1.) The 2010s were the first decade in history to go all 10 years without a recession, which of course ended just months into the new decade, as the economy stopped. Stocks gained 13.5% on an annual basis last decade, surprisingly, only the third-best decade over the past four.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 2.) This is an election year, and the S&amp;P 500 Index hasn\u2019t been lower when a President is up for reelection since FDR in 1940. Although this seemed nearly impossible at the March lows, it is looking like this incredible streak could have a chance in 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 3.) One of the first signs something could go wrong in 2020 was stocks fell in January. Historically, this has meant potential trouble for the final 11 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 4.) As fears over COVID-19 gripped the world, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its fastest bear market ever, in only 19 days. To put this in perspective, this was the fastest bear market in the 124-year history of the Dow.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 5.) Mark Twain said \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes\u201d. Looking at history, every 50 years there has been a terrible pandemic and stocks fell more than 30%. We don\u2019t know if the ultimate lows are in this time, but so far, history is rhyming.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 6.) More than 20 million people in the US lost their jobs in April, while the unemployment rate soared to near 15%, the highest since the Great Depression. Record drops in manufacturing, industrial production, retail sales, and consumer spending have all taken place in the past two months as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 7.) A recession is here, ending the streak of 128 months in a row without one. What is unique about the previous expansion was nominal gross domestic product (GDP) grew only 50%, about the average growth seen during the previous expansions, but this expansion was nearly twice as long as the average expansion (10 years versus 5 years).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 8.) The bounce off of the March 23 S&amp;P 500 lows has been historic in many ways. In fact, it was one of the best 20-day rallies ever, with previous best rallies seeing strong returns 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 9.) As scary as it was on the way down, stocks have come roaring back, gaining more than 35% from the March 23 lows. This would classify as the greatest bear market bounce ever, which opens the question: is this more than a bear market bounce and instead the start of a new bull market?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 10.) The number of COVID-19 tests in the US nearly doubled in May versus what was seen in April. Additionally, fewer and fewer tests are coming back positive. Testing is one of the key ways we will beat this and this is a step in the right direction. We\u2019ve also seen new monthly lows in people on ventilators, in the ICU, and in hospitals.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Hard to believe, but there are still 7 months left in 2020. It hasn\u2019t been easy for any of us, and we continue to keep everyone impacted by this pandemic in mind, but we continue to see the glass as half full. The dual benefit of record monetary and fiscal policy should help create a bridge to help those most impacted, while the economy can slowly come back online later this year.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending June 5th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1HAZbHiMUI))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 6.7.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n*(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)*\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$ADBE** \n&gt; * **$UNFI** \n&gt; * **$CHWY** \n&gt; * **$TIF** \n&gt; * **$LULU** \n&gt; * **$COUP** \n&gt; * **$SFIX** \n&gt; * **$LOVE** \n&gt; * **$NEPT** \n&gt; * **$GHM** \n&gt; * **$REVG** \n&gt; * **$GME** \n&gt; * **$HDS** \n&gt; * **$FIVE** \n&gt; * **$SIG** \n&gt; * **$CASY** \n&gt; * **$CVGW** \n&gt; * **$AMC** \n&gt; * **$FCEL** \n&gt; * **$QTNT** \n&gt; * **$PLCE** \n&gt; * **$CHS** \n&gt; * **$THO** \n&gt; * **$GCO** \n&gt; * **$BF.B** \n&gt; * **$LMNR** \n&gt; * **$WSG** \n&gt; * **$PRTY** \n&gt; * **$GES** \n&gt; * **$BBCP** \n&gt; * **$CONN** \n&gt; * **$HEXO** \n&gt; * **$PHR** \n&gt; * **$PVH** \n&gt; * **$RRGB** \n&gt; * **$PLAY** \n&gt; * **$TNP** \n&gt; * **$JW.A** \n&gt; * **$SB** \n&gt; * **$GSM** \n&gt; * **$SRT**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/bgPdMCr.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.8.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/d2EW1kr.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uxSiJJr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.9.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3SIjcG7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cRBrPlt.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.10.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DaheXAm.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9mcHxTl.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.11.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/i8SNjWM.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9xcBZPK.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.12.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Inc. $392.90\n&gt; **Adobe Inc.

        "selftext": "Hey guys. Self described medical-expert here to give you the daily update on the 'rona. I am here to reassure that the Media narrative being spun is FUD, and anyone who fearmongers is a PEDO GUY. I am going to use FACTS and DATA to CRUSH the doubters. \n\nDaily confirmed cases in US is trending DOWN WITH A TINY UPTICK over last week.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/GTRpv3b\n\nYes, there's a small uptick over last week, but with the mass protests occurring now two weeks ago, the notion that we are going to see runaway exponentials beginning again looks extremely unlikely -- a tiny little bump which won't repeat because the protests and the ending of the lockdowns are factors that won't repeat. So we are fine, I'd bet anything and am.\n\nConfirmed deaths looks even better, a straight line downward -- this makes sense too. People are enjoying the sunshine again, higher Vitamin D levels are protecting people.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gBX5weQ\n\nSource on Vitamin D: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-21211/v1\n\nVitamin D is not technically a Vitamin, but a hormone. It protects against viruses, it increases your testosterone levels and protects against obesity and health problems. One of the reasons African-Americans are susceptible to the 'rona is lower vitamin D, also obesity which is itself partly a result of lower Vitamin D. Being low D is the same as being low T.\n\n\nWe can see there are some countries having problems with the 'rona -- Brazil, India are the two biggest. One locked down and the other didn't (Totalitarianism doesn't work!). Both are poor countries with mega-slums. Both are equatorial nations which is why their spike took longer to happen. In the US, most of our people who were highly susceptible to the virus already got infected during the Winter which is why our Summer is looking so good. Brazilians are less rule-abiding than Indians which is why they have a bigger number.\n\nThe seasonal impact from this virus is now undeniable. Countries with exponential curves right now are all equatorial or Southern hemisphere, northern hemisphere is looking fantastic.\n\nThat unfortunately means that there WILL be a second wave in the fall. Make sure you TAN, get the SUNSHINE, make sure you LIFT. Make sure you take Vitamin D to INGEST SUNSHINE IN PILL FORM.\n\nMake sure you stay within six feet of ROBINHOOD USERS and anyone who buys HTZ or CHK and take off your mask and breathe directly into their faces. Let's make the market efficient again!\n\nToday I sold my puts up 40%. I am usually always wrong on my market timing, but that being said:\n\nWe have a V-shaped recovery and an unlimited money printer so I would continue to err on the side of bullishness. I fully believe we continue to set all-time highs in the coming weeks. This is a bear trap! Bet on America.",

It HAS to. However, we won't will see a massive drop in prices. At worst it will be 20%-30% drop in prices. However, I expect a V shaped recovery from the crash. I am currently 25% cash. I am sure there are many investors sitting in the sidelines sitting with mountains of cash waiting to jump right back in and will do so the moment a crash occurs triggering a recovery.\n\nOne of the tragedies of the 21st century is the massive income inequalities in our society. This means the wall street doesn't care about unemployment numbers. People with money will always have money to invest regardless of unemployment numbers and will constantly be looking forward for bargains. Add to that currently there is no safer and better investment than stocks (other than real estate which is a logistical nightmare to invest in). \n\nTLDR: Massive concentration of wealth will result in V shaped recovery when crash (20%-30%) occurs.",

S&amp;P financials were 12.1% higher on the week, S&amp;P industrials were up 10.5, and the NYSE airline index jumped more than 35.4.%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think next week is dominated by the reopening and it will be for another month,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. \u201cWith cyclicals outperforming, small [caps] outperforming, credit spreads coming in and then the bond yields going up, everybody \u2014 all facets of the financial markets \u2014 are sort of suggesting the same outcome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 3,193, a gain of 4.9%, and now traders are watching to see if it can scale the psychological 3,200 level. The Dow closed Friday at 27,110, up 6.8% for the week, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.4%, at 9,814 after reaching an intraday record high of 9,845 Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts say the market will likely look past the protests that broke out in cities across the U.S. after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Four policemen were charged with murder in his death. Looters joined the protests, some of which turned violent, but they quieted down towards the end of the week.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher for a third week in a row, but a change this past week has been the abrupt lurch higher in Treasury yields. The 10-year rose to a high of 0.95% Friday, a quarter-point move in just three sessions. The move was already underway but got a lift Wednesday when ADP jobs data was not nearly as bad as expected. Yields ripped even higher after the May employment report showed the unemployment rate actually fell to 13.3%, instead of climbing to 20%, as expected by economists.\n*****\n&gt; Bond strategists said the Treasury market was now acknowledging the potential for a recovery, but not in the exuberant way the stock market has been. Since March 23, the S&amp;P 500 has risen more than 45%, but it took the 10-year Treasury until this week to get back the yield level it was at when stocks bottomed.\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen said he believes a new bull market has been launched, but there could be pullbacks and some headwinds for the market coming up.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhen GDP is minus 30%, other issues don\u2019t matter. There\u2019s just one issue. But as the economy reopens again, the trade battles will matter again, presidential politics will matter again,\u201d said Paulsen, adding the budget deficit could also matter. \u201cI think we\u2019ll get removed from a sole focus. That isn\u2019t quite there but I think it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed begins its two-day meeting Tuesday, and will release its statement Wednesday afternoon, followed by a video briefing by Powell.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhey would the Fed want to disrupt this with anything?\u201d Paulsen said. \u201cThey\u2019re still going to support the economy. They\u2019re going to stay away from negative rates or yield curve management. They\u2019re not going to do anything to scare the markets. They might certainly reassure people that they are still ready to provide support.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America, said the Fed may clarify where it stands on some of the extraordinary moves it has taken since it cut rates to zero. The Fed has been supporting the markets with asset purchases and multiple programs for commercial paper, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds, for example.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe think right now they\u2019re just trying to get this Main Street lending program to work. The question is are they going to do more things around what they do in terms of forward guidance and next steps of macro easing,\u201d Harris said.\n*****\n&gt; There has been speculation that the Fed would do some type of so-called yield curve control, a program to keep interest rates capped at certain levels. \u201cI think it\u2019s too early for that,\u201d said Harris. He said the Fed would be guaranteeing low rates for a long period of time if it does yield curve control.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYield curve control is basically open-ended quantitative easing,\u201d he said. The Fed is currently buying Treasurys but if it wanted to stop yields from rising too much as the economy improves, it could make targeted purchases.\n*****\n&gt; Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said it\u2019s possible the Fed could announce the yield curve control. \u201cWe\u2019ve said they could implement yield curve control out to three years,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my mind that matches the length of the horizon of the economic projections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Powell has said the economy needs more fiscal help, and he could reiterate those comments Wednesday. President Donald Trump on Friday said he backs more stimulus. So far, the Democrats have put out a marker with their wish list for further spending, but there have been no negotiations.\n*****\n&gt; There was concern the strong jobs report could make it harder to get buy in for another big spending package. But some economists say the recovery needs a boost and states need funding to fill the holes in their budgets from coronavirus-related spending and a lack of tax receipts.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7klaXQm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PKTBzT2.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/a5JkAB6.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/M2x4Qoq.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qtJYfXN.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bjiJWjV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UAi19KJ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GQm4ruO.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uV1U7FN.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/wm2XJND.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yarkiMO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hFblu2G.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Stocks Outpacing Analyst Price Targets\n\n&gt; This morning's jobs report shocked the financial world -- most notably the economists whose job it is to provide estimates. The consensus estimate among economists for May nonfarm payrolls was projecting a loss of more than 7 million jobs. The actual number that was reported did not just show a smaller than expected job loss, but it actually showed a gain in jobs of more than 2.5 million.\n\n&gt; We're seeing a similar situation play out in the equity analyst community. With the S&amp;P 500 now up 40%+ since its low less than three months ago, the average stock in the index is now trading above its consensus analyst price target that looks 12 months out. Analysts have simply not been able to catch up to the rapid rise we've seen for equity prices.\n\n&gt; It's extremely rare to see share prices move above consensus analyst price targets. We don't have the historical daily data on this, but anecdotally we can't remember a time when the spread has been this wide. As shown below, at the end of 2019 when the S&amp;P finished a massive rally, equity prices were 5.5% below the consensus price target. That was seen as a very tight spread prior to what we're seeing now. At the lows in March, the average share price had dropped all the way to $92.50 compared to an average consensus price target of $143.20. That projected a gain of 54.9% at the time!\n\n&gt; Since March 23rd, the average share price has risen from $92.50 up to $138.40, while the average analyst price target has fallen from $143.20 to $136. Current price targets no longer project a gain for the average S&amp;P 500 stock, but rather a 1.7% drop.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/avgpricetarget.png))**\n\n&gt; # Nasdaq's Historical Run\n\n&gt; At its highs earlier this morning, the Nasdaq Composite was within 2% of its record high from earlier in the year. Besides the steep V-shape of the Nasdaq's pattern over the last four months, the other aspect of the chart that stands out is just how steep the 50-day moving average is trending lately.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-50DMAa.png))**\n\n&gt; To illustrate just how steep the Nasdaq's 50-DMA has become, the chart below shows the daily percentage change of the 50-day going back to 1971. Currently, the Nasdaq 50-DMA is rising at an average of over 0.5% per day. That's an incredible slope and a level that has been exceeded only a handful of times in the Nasdaq's 50-year history.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-Composite1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Big Gains From Smaller Tech\n\n&gt; It's still difficult to fathom the moves in the US equity market over the last four months. The fact that the Nasdaq and more specifically the Technology sector aren't far from record highs is definitely something no one was expecting two months ago. There's an old market saying that equities take the stairs up and the elevator down, but in the latest market cycle, the elevator up was almost as fast as the way down!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Nasdaq.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Technology-Sector.png))**\n\n&gt; If you've been following the markets, all you've likely heard up until recently is that large-cap tech, and more specifically, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Facebook (FB), are single-handedly driving the market higher. The reality is not nearly as clear-cut. Given their market caps, the \"Big 5\" (as they're often referred to) have done a lot of heavy lifting, but in terms of performance, they're hardly the only game in town.\n\n&gt; The table below lists Technology sector stocks in the Russell 3000 with market caps of more than $1 billion that are outperforming all of the 'big 5' tech stocks on a YTD basis. Actually, since Amazon is doing so well relative to the rest of the \"big 5\" these are all stocks that are outperforming Amazon. If we looked for stocks that were doing better than the average return of the \"big 5\" the list would be a lot, lot longer (+16.4%).\n\n&gt; Looking through the list of names below, the two top-performing names are Zscaler (ZS) and Twilio (TWLO), which have both more than doubled. Behind these two, DocuSign (DOCU) and Sprout Social (SPT) are both knocking on the door of triple-digits. All 28 of the names listed have market caps of $1 billion, but the average market cap is just over $21 billion, while Nvidia (NVDA) is the largest company on the list with a market cap of $216 billion. For the most part, these aren't names that have been driving the indices, but anyone holding these stocks in their portfolio probably doesn't care!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Tech-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Best 50-Day Rally Ever\n\n&gt; In many ways, what we\u2019ve seen so far in 2020 has been both record-breaking and devastating. From the S&amp;P 500 Index peak on February 19 to the bear market lows March 23, stocks lost 33.9%. Now, 50 trading days later, stocks have gained 39.6%, for the largest 50-day rally since the S&amp;P 500 moved to 500 stocks in 1957.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere are no rollercoasters that can replicate what stocks have done so far in 2020,\u201d exclaimed LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHere\u2019s the catch though: Big 50-day rallies in the past have taken place near the start of new bull markets, and the returns going out a year were quite bullish.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 39.6% gain in 50 days was the greatest 50-day rally ever, besting the previous best in October 1982. What\u2019s important to note here is that many of these rallies took place coming off major market lows, and delivered quite strong returns going out 6 to 12 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/best-fifty-days.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Although we have near-term worries given this historic run, as some sentiment indicators such as put/call ratios are showing some froth, from a bigger picture perspective, this strong 50-day rally offers a reason to think stock prices may be even higher this time next year.\n\n*****\n\n# 2020 In Charts\n\n&gt; 2020 is only five months old, but in many ways it is one of the most historic years we\u2019ve ever seen. \u201c2020 went from moving along nicely, to seeing the worst recession in a generation and the fastest bear market ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cNow stocks are in the midst of one of the best bull runs ever, even though the economy remains extremely weak, thanks to record stimulus and hopes over a vaccine.\u201d\n&gt; \nTo best sum it all up, here are 10 charts that tell the picture of 2020 so far.\n\n&gt; 1.) The 2010s were the first decade in history to go all 10 years without a recession, which of course ended just months into the new decade, as the economy stopped. Stocks gained 13.5% on an annual basis last decade, surprisingly, only the third-best decade over the past four.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 2.) This is an election year, and the S&amp;P 500 Index hasn\u2019t been lower when a President is up for reelection since FDR in 1940. Although this seemed nearly impossible at the March lows, it is looking like this incredible streak could have a chance in 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 3.) One of the first signs something could go wrong in 2020 was stocks fell in January. Historically, this has meant potential trouble for the final 11 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 4.) As fears over COVID-19 gripped the world, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its fastest bear market ever, in only 19 days. To put this in perspective, this was the fastest bear market in the 124-year history of the Dow.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 5.) Mark Twain said \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes\u201d. Looking at history, every 50 years there has been a terrible pandemic and stocks fell more than 30%. We don\u2019t know if the ultimate lows are in this time, but so far, history is rhyming.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 6.) More than 20 million people in the US lost their jobs in April, while the unemployment rate soared to near 15%, the highest since the Great Depression. Record drops in manufacturing, industrial production, retail sales, and consumer spending have all taken place in the past two months as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 7.) A recession is here, ending the streak of 128 months in a row without one. What is unique about the previous expansion was nominal gross domestic product (GDP) grew only 50%, about the average growth seen during the previous expansions, but this expansion was nearly twice as long as the average expansion (10 years versus 5 years).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 8.) The bounce off of the March 23 S&amp;P 500 lows has been historic in many ways. In fact, it was one of the best 20-day rallies ever, with previous best rallies seeing strong returns 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 9.) As scary as it was on the way down, stocks have come roaring back, gaining more than 35% from the March 23 lows. This would classify as the greatest bear market bounce ever, which opens the question: is this more than a bear market bounce and instead the start of a new bull market?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 10.) The number of COVID-19 tests in the US nearly doubled in May versus what was seen in April. Additionally, fewer and fewer tests are coming back positive. Testing is one of the key ways we will beat this and this is a step in the right direction. We\u2019ve also seen new monthly lows in people on ventilators, in the ICU, and in hospitals.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Hard to believe, but there are still 7 months left in 2020. It hasn\u2019t been easy for any of us, and we continue to keep everyone impacted by this pandemic in mind, but we continue to see the glass as half full. The dual benefit of record monetary and fiscal policy should help create a bridge to help those most impacted, while the economy can slowly come back online later this year.\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$ADBE** \n&gt; * **$UNFI** \n&gt; * **$CHWY** \n&gt; * **$TIF** \n&gt; * **$LULU** \n&gt; * **$COUP** \n&gt; * **$SFIX** \n&gt; * **$LOVE** \n&gt; * **$NEPT** \n&gt; * **$GHM** \n&gt; * **$REVG** \n&gt; * **$GME** \n&gt; * **$HDS** \n&gt; * **$FIVE** \n&gt; * **$SIG** \n&gt; * **$CASY** \n&gt; * **$CVGW** \n&gt; * **$AMC** \n&gt; * **$FCEL** \n&gt; * **$QTNT** \n&gt; * **$PLCE** \n&gt; * **$CHS** \n&gt; * **$THO** \n&gt; * **$GCO** \n&gt; * **$BF.B** \n&gt; * **$LMNR** \n&gt; * **$WSG** \n&gt; * **$PRTY** \n&gt; * **$GES** \n&gt; * **$BBCP** \n&gt; * **$CONN** \n&gt; * **$HEXO** \n&gt; * **$PHR** \n&gt; * **$PVH** \n&gt; * **$RRGB** \n&gt; * **$PLAY** \n&gt; * **$TNP** \n&gt; * **$JW.A** \n&gt; * **$SB** \n&gt; * **$GSM** \n&gt; * **$SRT**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/bgPdMCr.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.8.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/d2EW1kr.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uxSiJJr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.9.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3SIjcG7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cRBrPlt.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.10.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DaheXAm.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9mcHxTl.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.11.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/i8SNjWM.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9xcBZPK.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.12.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Inc. $392.90\n&gt; **Adobe Inc.

        "selftext": "The Oracle of Omaha has a reputation as the gentle GOAT, but is there more to this than meets the eye?\n\nIs there something that is often overlooked?\n\nOr is this reputation warranted? (get it...warren, warranted?)\n\nAnyway...Let's begin...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe story begins in 1942, when Warren Buffet bought his first shares at the age of just 11. \n\nThis is same year that his father Howard Buffett ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in the Nebraska district.\n\nHe won, and became a member of Congress in 1943.\n\nBefore this, Howard worked at a small stock brokerage firm.\n\nHe was reelected twice. However, in 1952, he decided against seeking another term and returned to his investment business in Omaha,\u00a0Buffett-Falk &amp; Co., where he worked until shortly before his death in 1964.\n\nBut what about Warren Buffett?\n\nIn 1951, after graduating from Columbia, where he was taught by Benjamin Graham, Buffett worked for three years at his father's firm as an investment salesman. \n\nIn 1954, Buffett accepted a job at Benjamin Graham's partnership, working as a securities analyst.\n\nHis starting salary was $12,000 a year - the equivalent of $114,000 today.\n\nHowever, just two years later, Graham retired and Buffett started his own investment partnership.\n\nHe went to his father's acquaintances to raise Capital for his first fund. \n\nThese were prominent families in Nebraska with big businesses and political connections.\n\nFor example, across the street was the family whose son became the CEO of Coca Cola - that family gave him $10,000.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn 2012, the STOCK Act or The Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act was signed into law.\u00a0 \n\nThe law prohibits the use of non-public information for private profit, including insider trading by members of Congress and other government employees.\n\nRemember, Buffett's father used to be in Congress.\n\n***The only people who were, before 2012, allowed to trade on insider information without having criminal charges brought against them were congressmen.***\n\nRemember, Buffett's father was a stock market broker prior to being elected and going to Congress, hence he had a comprehensive knowledge of the stock market and clearly had an interest in it. \n\nAfter all, it was his father who taught Buffett the ropes early on and had him buy his first shares as an eleven year old.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImagine you are Warren Buffett, and you can:\n\n1). Get insider information to trade on it;\n\n2). Get a six-figure position after College;\n\n3). After a few years, set up your own fund, getting money from wealthy family friends;\n\n4). Pay no dividends to investors and only put a hundred bucks of your own money into the fund;\n\n5). Let the mathematics of compounding work its magic as you bring in more institutional money;\n\n6). Become so connected Politically and connected on Wall Street that you can get special deals, which have practically no risk as you know bailouts are coming. For example, in the 2008 crisis, Berkshire owned stock valued at more than $13 billion in the top recipients of the TARP funds, and Berkshire had at least twice as much dependence on bailed-out banks as any other large investor;\n\n7). Have billions of dollars on hand, remember you aren't paying any dividends to investors, ready for the inevitable economic recession to hit so that you can sweep up cheap assets;\n\n8). Be holier-than-thou (i.e. calling derivatives \"financial weapons of mass destruction\" when, during the height of the 2008 crisis, Berkshire sold more than $2.5 billion worth of credit default swaps. OR what about Buffett's reputation as the saviour in the Great Recession when Berkshire is the majority owner of Moody's, who played a key role in inflating the crisis in 2008 - via their questionable debt and derivative ratings which inflated the mortgage and subprime market).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat about Buffett's status as the GOAT?\n\n[Jim Simons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcy8QaILDJI) has a far superior track record.\n\nBillionaire Chamath Palihapitiya has even stated that [Jeff Bezos is the best investor of our generation](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/12/chamath-palihapitiya-amazons-jeff-bezos-the-best-investor-better-than-warren-buffett.html#:~:text=Chamath%20Palihapitiya%20calls%20Amazon's%20Jeff%20Bezos,investor%2C%20better%20than%20Warren%20Buffett&amp;text=%E2%80%9CPeople%20used%20to%20lambaste%20Jeff,said%20on%20%E2%80%9CSquawk%20Box.%E2%80%9D), not Warren Buffett.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBuffett has missed out on an entire raft of tech and Berkshire has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 in recent years.\n\nBerkshire's best years are found overwhelmingly in the period before the tech era.\n\nAlso, he has been critical of Bitcoin, describing it as \"rat poison squared\"\n\nUltimately, Buffett is worth $73 billion, he doesn't need to have an in-depth understanding of new age tech.\n\nMoreover, Buffett has a huge stake in Finance 1.0, why would he give props to Finance 2.0?\n\nBitcoin as a savings vehicle is misaligned with Berkshire's don't-save-money-invest-it-in-us or consume more of the products of the businesses that Berkshire has a huge stake in, and is also misaligned with Berkshire's Cantillon insider advantages.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's worth noting that Howard Buffett strongly supported the gold standard because he believed it would limit the ability of government to inflate the money supply and spend beyond its means. Here is a direct quote from Howard:\n\n***\"I warn you that politicians of both parties will oppose the restoration of gold, although they may outwardly seemingly favor it,\u00a0unless you are willing to surrender your children and your country to galloping inflation, war and slavery\u00a0then this cause demands your support. For if human liberty is to survive in America, we must win the battle to restore honest money. There is no more important challenge facing us than this issue -- the restoration of your freedom to secure gold in exchange for the fruits of your labors.\"***\n\nHis son Warren, however, hates gold. See the [Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs) as to why.\n\n**Some have even argued that Buffett's success can be summarised by the following:**\n\n**First Deals = Insider Information**\n\n**Last Deals = Cantillon Effect**\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nIs it true... or false?\n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UpTUBgUYgc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UpTUBgUYgc)",

Back-story: March Liquidity Madness\n\n(Skip to part Dos if you have a better memory than a goldfish.)\n\nKnown unknowns, like the spread of COVID-19, US-Iran tensions, supply chain and demand impact, the oil shock, and unknown unknowns injected fear into the market.\n\nFear of a liquidity crisis crashed the market. It would have been far bloodier if JPow hadn't stepped in, using QE infinity to fill the wound with [trillions of dollars](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_recenttrends.htm).\n\nThis monopoly money pump carried (is carrying) the rally longer than even permabulls expected.\n\n# II. Why This Doesn't Solve Underlying Problems\n\nLiquidity problems are a bygone memory, but solvency is *still* a nagging fear.\n\nWhen millions of jobs were lost, many of you said \"they'll come back when the \ud83c\udf7a\ud83e\udda0 / lockdown is over!\"\n\n[They didn't](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000). Consumers aren't spending, it's been 2 months since Trump Bux came in the mail, enhanced unemployment allowances expire next month, corporate debt is rocketing - all this speaks to a looming solvency issue.\n\nMany of you bears have given up on the market, resigning to the belief that \"economic data doesn't matter anymore.\"\n\nIn a bubble, you're right. A bubble will inflate as long as exuberance dominates over reality, but reality eventually comes knocking.\n\nOtherwise, \ud83c\udd71\ufe0fit-c-o-\u2139\ufe0f-n would be @ $500,000, and the SPY $500 memes would soon become prophecies.\n\nI'm not going to join the screeching chorus of false prophets by telling you when the next leg down will be, though if I had to guess, it'll be in November, where any situation looks bad for the market.\n\nIf Donny Pump solidifies his next term, he no longer has to worry about \"[STOCK MARKET @ ALL-TIME HIGH](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1215299143066947584?lang=en)\" for securing re-election.\n\nIf Joe \"[increase corporate tax](https://taxfoundation.org/joe-biden-tax-plan-2020/)\" Biden wins, the stock market drops to the bottom of the list of Presidential priorities.\n\n# III. $MSFT, $V, and $MA: Robinhood-fueled irrational highs.\n\nFun fact: MSFT is @ an all-time-high.

        "selftext": "\u201cDon\u2019t fight the Fed.\u201d That mantra is repeated as fact amongst almost every market participant across the globe (other than Davey Day Trader, who doesn\u2019t know what a central bank is). Based off of that logic, one could reasonably assume that the Fed and Jerome Powell are the reasons for this recent market rally. All of WSB is bullish, and you can\u2019t go more than four posts on WSB without seeing some exhausted money printer meme or a pro-Powell love fest. After a week of reading economic research papers nonstop, I think I have stumbled into something that the market and the Fed won\u2019t see until it is too late to stop.\n\nFull disclosure: I am not an expert and this post should not be construed as anything other than my opinions and theories. This will be an extremely long and conceptual post (with a lot of references to research papers) that focuses more on economics than any financial analysis. It is not hard to understand, but be prepared to read.\n\n**Fed Reaction to Coronavirus**\n\nThe Fed\u2019s reaction to coronavirus was extremely quick. After seeing what worked to stop the financial crisis in 2008, the Fed used the same playbook. Lower rates to near zero, buy treasuries (quantitative easing), buy mortgage backed securities, cut the reserve ratio to 0%. That playbook didn\u2019t work though, the market kept selling off though. The Fed then did something unprecedented, they started buying corporate bond ETFs. They only bought high grade corporate bonds at first, but quickly realized that they had to buy junk bonds in order to keep the corporate bond market stabilized. Recently, the Fed [quietly announced](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-mainstreet/fed-eases-terms-of-main-street-loans-tells-banks-to-start-disbursing-idUSKBN23F2N8) a ramp up of their Main Street lending program, along with guaranteeing 95% of the loans instead of a range of 85-95%. This implies, to me, that banks don\u2019t want to give out loans unless the Fed backstops them more. That will become important later in this post.\n\nThe Fed has also been buying commercial mortgage backed securities. These CMBSs are facing [extremely high levels of delinquency](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/cmbs-delinquencies-climb-in-may-with-hotels-and-retail-faring-worst-58714661). According to that article, 7.6% of all CMBS loans are delinquent as of May, along with 19.3% of hotel loans and 10% of retail loans. A [whistleblower report]{https://www.propublica.org/article/whistleblower-wall-street-has-engaged-in-widespread-manipulation-of-mortgage-funds) indicates that the loans in these securities did not go through much scrutiny and could be massively overpriced as well. These assets are so toxic that the Fed [won\u2019t even take that many of them](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/agency-commercial-mortgage-backed-securities/agency-commercial-mortgage-backed-securities-operations). In fact, the Fed has quietly [reduced their asset purchases](https://i.imgur.com/zlMFwbr.jpg) since the last week of March. This is just background information so I can explain what the Fed has been doing to the market so people can stop attributing the rally to Jerome Powell.\n\n**Reasons For the Rally**\n\nNow that I have explained what the Fed has been doing, I want to explain the reasons for this rally. This rally is driven by retail. How? Delta hedging. Some of you know about delta hedging, but for those who don\u2019t I will explain a quick summary. A retail investors buys a call from a market maker. That market maker, being more risk averse than we are accustomed to, doesn\u2019t like to sell naked options so the market maker will buy enough shares to become delta neutral. That means that as the call they sold goes up in price, they have shares that will cover most or all of their losses. Options are highly leveraged instruments, which is important because it gives retail the leverage that they need to get market makers to pump the market for them.\n\nThe important thing is that the analysts and value investors that are crediting the Fed for this rally don\u2019t understand the options market as well as degenerates like us do. Retail has been [piling in](https://i.imgur.com/xuzFRSw.jpg) to the stock market at an astounding rate, especially into everyone\u2019s favorite [broker](https://i.imgur.com/mNve5Mu.jpg). This data is as of the beginning of May and I suspect it\u2019s a hell of a lot higher. \n\nBloomberg published some more up to date data recently regarding small option traders buying calls. Take a look at [the graph](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ixvGtK3QI_Aw/v0/1400x-1.png) for yourself, it has gone parabolic. The [Bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-09/speculative-fervor-in-u-s-stocks-surges-to-stunning-levels) states, \u201cTraders established fresh bullish positions last week by buying 35.6 million new call options on equities, according to Sundial founder Jason Goepfert. That\u2019s up from a peak of 28.7 million in February, when speculative activity was rampant, he wrote in a note Monday.\u201d The volume from small options traders is estimated to be 50% in that same article, the highest since 2000. Google Trends for [\u201chow to trade options\u201d](https://i.imgur.com/6nf8LTw.png) and [\u201crobinhood trade options\u201d](https://i.imgur.com/4NJwVfh.png) have gone parabolic recently as well. The put/call ratio across all equities is also at [historic lows](https://c.stockcharts.com/c-sc/sc?s=%24CPCE&amp;p=D&amp;b=5&amp;g=1&amp;i=p77530317141), indicating a mass wave of euphoria and a lack of hedges. \n\nAfter seeing all of this, it is clear to me that this is a retail driven bubble and not driven by the Fed after April. Where is retail getting the money for this? The answer lies in the [savings rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PSAVERT). According to the Fed, the savings rate \u201cis calculated as the ratio of personal saving to DPI. Personal saving is equal to personal income less personal outlays and personal taxes; it may generally be viewed as the portion of personal income that is used either to provide funds to capital markets or to invest in real assets such as residences.\u201d As you can see in the graph, the savings rate is now significantly higher than it has ever been before, coming in at 33%. This means that consumers are not spending money, they are saving or investing it. Consumers are also paying down [credit card debt](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TOTALSL) at much higher rates than anticipated. In the month of April, consumer credit had the [largest decrease since tracking began in 1968](https://eyeonhousing.org/2020/06/april-consumer-credit-indicates-recovery-challenges/). Remember the data in this paragraph, I\u2019m going to refer to it later in regards to deflation.\n\n**Effects of Quantitative Easing**\n\nBefore talking more about the bubble, I am going to outline some data that shows the impact of QE on our economy since 2008 up until now.\n\nThe main effect of low interest rates along with quantitative easing is an increase in the money supply. You can see that increase [here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2). Typically throughout history, an expansion in the money supply has lead to an increase in the inflation rate. That [has not happened](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FPCPITOTLZGUSA), the Fed has struggled to hit the target inflation rate since the crisis. With such an increase in the money supply, hyperinflation is stopped by the velocity at which the money moves. In 2006, Ben Bernanke noticed this phenomenon, [stating](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/10/business/worldbusiness/10iht-fed.3490493.html), \u201cthe empirical relationship between money growth and variables such as inflation and nominal output growth has continued to be unstable.\u201d A recent [research paper](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ecolet/v182y2019icp23-25.html) has also found a significant positive correlation between wealth inequality and monetary growth.\n\nVelocity of money is defined by the Fed as: \u201cthe frequency at which one unit of currency is used to purchase domestically- produced goods and services within a given time period. In other words, it is the number of times one dollar is spent to buy goods and services per unit of time. If the velocity of money is increasing, then more transactions are occurring between individuals in an economy.\u201d This velocity has been trending downward in a big way since 2008 (and before), not just in the US but everywhere. Velocity of the M2 money supply in the US broke through the previous low (tracking started in 1960) by 2012. Velocity is now [significantly lower](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V). M2 velocity includes bank reserves though, so let\u2019s take a look at the [velocity of M1](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1V) (which is physical currency and checking account deposits). [Demand deposits](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WDDNS) (checking account balances) have been exploding since 2008, with another massive jump starting in March. This means that cash is not being used and not adding to consumer prices or any economic productivity. I believe all of this to be an effect of QE and a prolonged period of low rates.\n\n**Liquidity Trap**\n\nThere has been a safe asset shortage since the advent of QE, as central banks of developed economies accumulate safe government bonds and US treasuries. This has lead to a shortage of safe assets, driving prices up and yields down artificially. Ricardo Caballero, an MIT economist, said [this](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1257/jep.31.3.29) (warning: PDF) in 2017: \u201cThe ongoing pressures driving the imbalance in safe asset markets has in recent decades helped to drive the steady decline in interest rates on safe assets. However, interest rates on these assets cannot fall much further. When the equilibrium full-employment interest rate needs to be negative, but cannot adjust sufficiently downward, then (other things equal) the equilibrating mechanism is an endogenous decline in safe asset demand through a reduction in aggregate income and wealth. That is, equilibrium is achieved through recession.\u201d At the end of 2019, the Fed owned [36% of all US treasuries](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/funding-covid-19-debt-splurge-risks-the-independence-of-major-central-banks-58610836), with that number only set to increase after their open market operations this year. of April 21st, central banks around the world have bought [5 times](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/central-banks-buy-trillion-financial-assets-g7-march-federal-reserve-2020-4-1029113160) the value of treasuries as they did in 2008.\n\nThis shortage of safe assets has pushed yields down and made it so that banks have no desire to make loans to decrease their reserves. Take a look at the [excess reserves](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/EXCSRESNS) banks have been holding. Since the 2008 crisis, excess reserves have exploded. This means that the bank is sitting on cash that they are doing nothing with. The common belief is that lending goes up as rates go down, since banks have to make more loans in order to sustain the same amount of profit. However, the data does not show that to be the case since the introduction of QE. The key thing that I have noticed in regards to excess returns and loans is that banks do not want to make loans at these low yields, possibly due to the massive unpriced systemic risk of our debt bubble popping. In Q1 2020, banks tightened their loan standards at a rate [comparable to 2008](https://www.barrons.com/articles/banks-are-tightening-lending-standards-like-it-was-2008-again-51588881348).\n\nA liquidity trap is created when low interest rates are low and consumers and institutions decide to save money instead of investing in low yielding bonds. The Fed started paying banks a [small risk free interest rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IOER) in 2008, which moves along with the Fed funds rate. I theorize that the shortage of safe assets and low interest rates has gone past the \u201creversal rate\u201d and accommodative monetary policy has become contractionary. In these uncertain times, banks would rather collect the small guaranteed risk free interest rate instead of introducing their balance sheets to any more risk, especially underpriced risk. The Fed believes that they are stimulating lending by cutting rates to 0. However, banks appear to not want to make non-guaranteed loans and instead are content to sit on their excess reserves. This means that the expansion of the monetary supply is not working as intended and that the money sitting in bank reserves is becoming contractionary. If loans aren\u2019t being made and that money isn\u2019t being spent, then that money may as well not exist in the money supply at all. According to a [Princeton economist](https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/markus/files/25b_reversalrate.pdf) (PDF), quantitative easing raises this reversal interest rate and should only be done after rate cuts are exhausted. This means that the Fed could be unknowingly contracting the money supply, even though it appears that they are massively expanding it on paper.\n\n**Deflation**\n\nDeflation occurs when institutions and individuals don\u2019t spend their money in the real economy, whether by purchasing goods/services or making loans to businesses. The Fed\u2019s [deflation probability](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/STLPPMDEF), which is the possibility that personal consumption expenditures price index change will go below 0 in the next 12 months, spiked from .001 in January to .763 in May. The [probability](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/STLPPM) that we have inflation over 2.5% over the next 12 months has crashed down to .002 as of last month. As shown in the data above, consumers aren\u2019t spending and banks are stockpiling their reserves. This is deflationary and will lead to lower prices, lower corporate earnings, and lower asset prices.\n\nAs mentioned in the data further up in the post, consumer credit dropped at a much quicker rate than expected, even with projections taking coronavirus into account. Economists expected consumer credit to fall by [$14 billion](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-consumer-credit-plummets-in-april-as-credit-card-use-tumbles-by-record-amount-2020-06-05) in April, but it fell by $68.8 billion instead. This was the largest one month drop in consumer borrowing since 1943. The core consumer price index (CPI) also [missed expectations](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/10/us-consumer-price-index-may-2020.html) of a 0-0.1% jump, instead falling by 0.1% for last month. This came after April was the largest drop (-0.4%) on record since data started in 1957.\n\nAccording to [research from the Netherlands central bank](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ecosys/v42y2018i1p45-63.html) (PDF), QE encourages risk taking by market participants and creates asset pricing bubbles. We are seeing bubbles across all asset classes thanks to the levels of debt in the economy (the stock market being an example). We even see debt bubbles too, like the $9 trillion of [corporate debt](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/21/theres-a-9-trillion-corporate-debt-bomb-bubbling-in-the-us-economy.html) (as of 2018) which help fuel these asset bubbles. The research from the Netherlands central bank also shows that asset bubbles popping are worth -4% inflation. An asset price bubble does not signal inflation either. I have picked out some quotes from the researcher that show QE might be leading to deflation:\n\n&gt;Overall, the results suggest that the signaling value of asset prices for inflation is weak and unstable, implying that while QE is effective in boosting asset prices \u2013 one of the main transmission channels of QE \u2212 higher asset prices may not always lead to higher inflation. High asset prices may even precede a low inflation regime. For policymakers this is useful information because, based on the outcome of our models, one cannot presume that QE by definition leads to higher inflation.\n\n&gt;If [\u2026] a surge in asset prices is not supported by real economic developments and therefore becomes unsustainable at some stage, the subsequent asset price collapse may cause a recession. \n&gt;While central banks intend to raise inflation by purchasing government bonds to reduce bond yields, our results indicate that this policy can have the opposite effect on inflation.\n\n**Conclusion: The Fake V-Shaped Recovery**\n\nI conclude after doing this research, that there is no chance of a V-shaped recovery in the economy, despite what the market is signaling. I believe that we are about to enter into a massive deflation cycle that is being assisted inadvertently by the Fed\u2019s policy of QE and the near 0% interest rates. Consumer credit is contracting and banks are stashing extra reserves, meaning that the real money supply is contracting. Default risk on commercial mortgage backed securities, corporate bonds (thanks to lower earnings), and other forms of debt will continue to rise as the economic effects of coronavirus and monetary policy undertaken by the Fed continue to be revealed. Defaults will rise even more if we get prolonged and sustained deflation as the weight of our debt crushes our financial system. I believe that, due to the historically high levels of retail activity in the market, it will crash soon as well. The wealth inequality effect of QE (which Powell denies the existence of) will make it increasingly harder for the economy to recover.\n\nAll of these things will feed off of each other as we get further into a deflationary cycle. It will be very difficult, if not impossible, for the Fed to get out of this crisis when we get into it. Deflation is rare historically and makes monetary policy ineffective, it is a central bank\u2019s worst nightmare. Deflation will dry up economic activity and cause us to go into a depression which will be difficult to get out of.\n\n**tl;dr**: Powell thinks he is injecting money into the economy but it really isn\u2019t going anywhere, the stock market is in a bubble that will pop very soon, corporate bond and CMBS default rates will increase over the coming year, deflation will make debt a heavier burden and cash more valuable, the Fed is powerless to stop it. Our economy enters a deflationary cycle that will be hard to get out of, until the bank reserves find their way into the real economy.\n\nI\u2019ve spent a very long time researching this stuff but I am not an expert in economics or monetary policy, just another idiot on WSB. I look forward to seeing any discussion or disagreement with the ideas that I have discussed.",

        "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/09/robinhood-traders-cash-in-on-the-market-comeback-that-billionaire-investors-missed.html\n\nOne 26-year-old Robinhood trader made $1,500 in less than 24 hours betting on a beaten-down airline stock, while many so-called experts on Wall Street warned about buying into an overvalued stock market that was bound to tumble again amid the coronavirus pandemic. \n\nLast Thursday, Lequon Godbolt, purchased a call option for American Airlines that made him $200 on the millennial-favored stock trading app.\n\nAfter seeing reports that the airline was increasing domestic flying for summer travel, Godbolt bought another call option minutes before the close. When the market opened higher last Friday after a surprisingly positive jobs report, Godbolt raked in his profits. \n\n\u201cI just started taking it seriously about two months ago,\u201d Godbolt \u2014 a New York resident\u2014 told CNBC. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching AAL since the beginning of that time and I felt eventually, once Covid relaxed, markets would move up.\u201d\n\nGodbolt is not alone is his success trading this market. One Chicago-resident flipped his sister\u2019s stimulus check into nearly $10,000. \n\nRobinhood traders lived up to their outlaw name during the coronavirus market downturn. The young investors booked profits \u2014 trading stocks with some of the best returns in the past two months \u2014 while other Wall Street veterans were left scratching their heads. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like momentum begetting momentum,\u201d Tim Welsh, founder and CEO of wealth management consulting firm Nexus Strategy, told CNBC. \u201cThe aspect of just access is really driving a lot of this and the whole upward tick in the markets, again, just fuels demand.\u201d\n\nYoung investors, like Godbolt, appeared to have a prescient understanding of the market, unlike the billionaire hedge fund managers who said stocks would retest their lows. Longtime investor Stanley Druckenmiller \u2014 who misjudged equities\u2019 comeback \u2014 said Monday that the market\u2019s strong performance over the last three weeks has \u201chumbled\u201d him and that he underestimated the power of the Federal Reserve.\n\nEven legendary investor Warren Buffett sold his stake in airlines during the pandemic. Of course, the Berkshire Hathaway chairman is a long-term, bargain shopper and the airline industry\u2019s long-term outlook is yet to be determined. \n\nV-shape after all?\nSigns are pointing to a V-shaped recovery \u2014 a sharp fall in economic activity followed by a dramatic rise \u2014 in the economy. This theory was rejected by economists and investors who found it unrealistic due to the detrimental ramifications of the mandated shutdown of the U.S. economy. \n\nStocks have soared in June, helped by the historic Labor Department jobs report that showed the U.S. economy added a record 2.5 million jobs in May. Wall Street was calling for a decline of 8.3 million. The unemployment rate dropped to 13.3%, far better than the expected 19.5% rate.",

        "selftext": "In this week's edition of DDDD (Data-Driven DD), we'll be exploring the most common way that investors calculate what a stock's actually worth, and then why this valuation method no longer anymore. Also, apparently mods disabled image uploads, so this post is going to be a bit hard to read since I rely a lot on visuals in them; please direct all your complaints to them.\n\n  \n*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so; look at what happened to all the SPY 220p 4/17 bag holders. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*\n\n# The Discounted Cash Flow Model\n\nThe DCF model is the most common model for valuing companies in finance, and hence the fair value of a stock. It\u2019s based on one simple principle: the value of a company is based on the ability of that company to generate cash flows in the future. This principle is used in virtually every other financial instruments, like bonds, and is also used to help aid capital expenditure decisions. This method of valuing a company became popular after the 1929 stock market crash, once the \u201cstonks\u00a0only go up\u201d mentality broke and investors started investing in equities based on value and returns rather than speculation, which drove much of the stock market in the 1920s, but this idea has been used as far back as ancient Egypt.\n\n**Time Value of Money**\n\nBefore looking into the math behind the DCF model, another principle needs to be understood - Time Value of Money. This is the principle that money today, or the Present Value, is worth more than money in the future, or Future Value. The difference in worth can be caused by many things, such as inflation, the interest rate of Treasuries (i.e. risk free rate), and risk of default. This difference of worth is calculated to some interest rate, r, which is then used to calculate the Present Value of some future cash flow.\n\n[Time Value of Money Formula](https://imgur.com/a/1DGJMFj)\n\n**Cost of Capital**\n\nIn the case of valuing a company, what would this rate be? Typically, the Weighted Average Cost of Capital, or WACC is used for this percentage.\n\n[WACC Formula](https://imgur.com/a/pBwR0xB)\n\nWACC in simple terms is the rate of return typically required to be paid by the company to shareholders and bondholders to raise capital from them. In this formula,\n\n*E is the market capitalization of all equity in the company*\n\n*D is the value of all debt in the company*\n\n*V = E+D*\n\n*Tc is the tax rate paid by the company*\n\n*Rd is the cost of debt, for simplicity let\u2019s say this is the average interest rate paid by the company for its outstanding debts*\n\n*Re is the cost of equity. The most common way of calculating this is the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), with the formula below*\n\n[Cost of Equity Formula](https://imgur.com/a/l8hRXa4)\n\nIn this formula,\n\nRf is the risk free rate, which is the interest rate an investor can receive when investing in some risk free asset, like a US treasury\n\n\u03b2 represents the volatility of a company\u2019s stock on the stock market; this value has its own complicated formula but this value can be usually found in most stock trading platforms\n\nRm is the long-term return of equity markets. Hence (Rm - Rf) is typically seen as the equity risk premium, which is the excess returns given by the stock market for taking on the risk of investing in equities rather than treasuries\n\n**Free Cash Flow**\n\nFree cash flow is typically reported as part of a public company\u2019s financial statements and hence can easily be discovered. Intuitively, it\u2019s the company\u2019s ability to generate cash from operations to pay back stock and bond holders, and is calculated by adding non-cash expenses (i.e. depreciation, amortization), subtracting capital expenditures, and adding increases in current assets - liabilities to the post-tax EBIT, or Earnings before Interest and Taxes.\n\n**Putting it all together**\n\n[Enterprise Value Formula](https://imgur.com/a/IXoFalW)\n\nWith all of these in mind, let\u2019s use them to calculate the Enterprise Value of a company. This is done by adding the sums of all future cash flows generated by the company, and discounting it by the weighted average cost of capital. Since a company can have a potentially perpetual stream of cash flows, and future cash flows beyond a few years becomes very unpredictable, we would instead only do this calculation for the first five years, and then add some \u201cTerminal Value\u201d of the company to represent how much the company would be worth by the end of that period, and discount that as well.\n\n[Terminal Value Formula](https://imgur.com/a/3dfSLS9)\n\nTo calculate this Terminal Value, we\u2019ll need to have some rate, g, which represents the \u201cgrowth rate\u201d of the company once it\u2019s mature and no longer growing rapidly (i.e. taking market share).\n\nOnce you add all of the discounted near-term cash flows and discounted Terminal Value, you now have the Enterprise Value. Once you have that, figuring out the fair value of all the equity in a company, or the market cap, is easy.\n\n**Fair Market Cap = Enterprise Value - Total Debt + Cash**\n\n# Where we are right now\n\nLet\u2019s see how recent events have changed the equation for equity valuations today compared to in January for the stock market overall.\n\n**Cost of Equity**\n\nRisk Free Rate - Looking at US Treasuries, this is this most obvious and well-known change in this equation, with yields plummeting from 1.5% from the start of the year to near 0% today.\n\n[Risk Free Rate Graph](https://imgur.com/a/LLcMoDC)\n\nMarket Risk Premium - This one is a bit complicated because it can\u2019t really be immediately calculated and is based largely on investor sentiment. Historically, market risk premium has been between 5% to 6% for the US stock market. This can easily change, however, based on economic and financial conditions. Right now, let\u2019s assume this has remained unchanged, but we\u2019ll get back to this later.\n\n**Cost of Capital**\n\nDebt - Corporate debt this year has exploded, with an [additional $1 Trillion raised by companies](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/29/corporations-raise-1-trillion-in-the-bond-market-after-fed-backstop-double-the-pace-of-last-year.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1591575861873000)\u00a0so far, more than double from last year at the same time of the year\n\nEquity - SPY started at this year at $325; As of time of writing, it\u2019s within 2% of this number\n\nCost of Debt - Despite skyrocketing bond yields in March as the economy experienced a liquidity crisis, bond yields have since stabilized, aided by the Fed backstop, and bonds yields are now at about the same levels as it was at the start of the year.\n\n[Bond Yields](https://imgur.com/a/wFITrco)\n\nSo assuming the risk premium being the same, compared to the start of the year, we have a slightly lower cost of equity from a lower risk free rate, roughly the same cost of debt, and having increased corporate debt, making the debt weigh more proportionally than before in our WACC. Since the cost of debt is usually slightly lower than the cost of equity, this provides a slight downwards pressure towards WACC as well. Thus, WACC has decreased by a small amount since January, due to increased debt levels and decreased risk free rates.\n\n**Free Cash Flow**\n\nFor most non-tech companies, the lockdown has severely hurt their cash flows, with many industries such as airlines burning billions of dollars per month. It\u2019s pretty hard to find up-to-date metrics of what free cash flow is for the S&amp;P500, so instead, I\u2019ll just use earnings as a proxy to make a very rough estimate of what it might look like. According to [one source](https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_051520.pdf) I found, Q1 saw the YoY decline of 14.6%, with an estimated 36% decline in earnings for Q2.\n\nWhat free cash flow looks like for the remainder of the year, and future years depends on two very fundamental questions.\n\nFirst, will there be a second wave of lockdowns later in the year? On one side of this, based on the history of similar pandemics and what most medical experts are saying, a second spike of cases is extremely likely to occur in the fall. On the other hand, the US population seemed to have stopped caring about the virus, and is currently distracted by other problems. It\u2019s unclear whether or not the US population will care enough to lock down the country once again when the second wave hits after being desensitized with the first wave. In fact the first wave never really stopped; the US just started pretending that the pandemic is over and it\u2019s time to go back to business as usual.\n\n[US Daily Cases](https://imgur.com/a/iVirLQ4)\n\n[Daily Cases for Italy; What \"flatten the curve\" actually looks like](https://imgur.com/a/fhaz2IR) \n\nThe second question, assuming the answer to the first question is \u201cNo\u201d, is what kind of recovery the US economy will see. According to [one source](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://conference-board.org/publications/Economic-Forecast-US&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1591575861874000), \u00a0\u201cV\u201d-shaped recovery will see earnings going back to normal as early as 2021. A \u201cU\u201d-shaped recovery, which will represent a recession, could see it take up until 2022 to return back to pre-COVID output levels. If we do see a second wave of lockdowns, then what might be seen is a \u201cW\u201d-shaped recovery, where we\u2019ll see a second steep decline in GDP, and prolong the recession and make it tougher to get towards a recovery as more businesses go bankrupt.\n\n[GDP Projections](https://imgur.com/a/jK78km1)\n\nMissing from this model is an \u201cL\u201d-shaped recovery, similar to what happened in Japan in the 1990s, and the US in the 1930s, which would represent a decade-long depression. This is what I personally believe would look like in [my long-term thesis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gqgwfg/dddd_cycles_and_human_history/), along with some of the most famous investors in the financial world, [like Ray Dalio](https://www.principles.com/the-changing-world-order/).\n\nBack to the DCF Model; we have an additional $1 Trillion of corporate debt. With a total market cap of $32 Trillion, the effect of this on the fair value of equities are negligible. With nearly the same market cap as in the beginning of the year, this would mean the market is pricing in the same Enterprise Value for the market as the start of the year. This implies either one of two things, based on the factors explained about\n\n1. The stock market has priced in a \u201cV\u201d-shaped recovery for earnings, with earnings and free cash flow beyond 2020 to remain unimpaired.\n2. The stock market has priced in a \u201cU\u201d-shaped recovery, but this is offset by a lower WACC as the market risk premium has significantly lowered. This can be caused by a few things, such as decreased perceived risk by investors of companies due to fiscal and monetary stimulus, and inflows of cash that was previously waiting in the sidelines (eg. retail investors), large international funds (eg. Saudi and Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth funds), and yield-seeking institutions as Treasury yields drop to 0%, with no prospect of a rate increase anytime soon.\n\n**Why Fundamentals Might Not Matter Anymore**\n\nThere\u2019s another thing that can explain the recent stock market movements other the reasons explained above of what the stock market was pricing in - a stock market bubble. This happens when speculation in the market overpowers fundamentals, and the money in the market is no longer investing for long-term, earnings-based gains, but rather trying to get short-term gains through speculation. In other words people throwing their money in the stock market aren\u2019t investing because they legitimately think the company has good fundamentals and will give a good return on their investment through earnings in the long term, but because they believe that stocks only go up, and hence they can make a quick buck by throwing some money in it and cashing out later and making money through capital gains. This is how every asset bubble starts, from the Dutch tulip-mania bubble, the English South Sea bubble, the 1920s stock market bubble, the dot com stock market bubble, and the real estate bubble in the 2000s.\n\nTo give an example to illustrate what\u2019s happening, let\u2019s look at one of the first major bankruptcies to have happened during the stock market crash - Whiting Petroleum (WLL). I\u2019ve previously covered WLL, but the most interesting part of it is the dislocation of the valuation of its stock and bonds.\n\nWLL [reached a bankruptcy agreement](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1255474/000119312520118310/d922194dex10.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1591575861876000)\u00a0with some of its key creditors on April 23. To be clear, this agreement has not been agreed upon with all its creditors and has yet to be approved by the court, and represents the best-case outcome for existing WLL shareholders; the court or creditors and reject this and demand better terms, or even worse, request to change the bankruptcy to a Chapter 7 and liquidate all the assets. The agreement was to restructure the corporation such that the bondholder will receive 97% of the restructured company\u2019s equity, and the remaining 3% will be given to existing shareholders and management.\n\nAs of this writing, the price for WLL bonds were all between $15 - $16.50.\n\n[Example WLL Bond Pricing](https://imgur.com/a/ktLeGQo)\n\nUsing this, we can calculate what the bond market is pricing the restructured WLL at; multiplying the market value of all the outstanding bonds by 97% would give you the implied price of it. From the most recent [10-Q](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc%3D/Archives/edgar/data/1255474/000125547420000011/wll-20200331x10q.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1591575861876000), the face value of all notes involved in the bankruptcy agreement is $2.4B. Using the highest bond price of $16.5, or 0.165% of face value, the implied market cap of the restructured WLL would be $2.4B \\* \u00a00.165% \\* 97% = $384M.\n\nWith 91M shares outstanding, this would mean the fair value of the old WLL shares would be $384M \\* 3% / 91M = $0.13. As of writing, the current share price is more than 10 times higher than this, at $1.38.\n\nHow could this be possible? It\u2019s because absolutely no one speculates with bonds, and bond prices are usually entirely grounded in fundamentals; people buying bonds buy it to hold onto it and not to sell it later at a higher price. The opposite is clearly happening with WLL stocks. Noone is buying WLL to receive a small stake in the reorganized corporation once the bankruptcy agreement clears in the best case; if an institution really wanted it, they would have just bought the bonds. Instead, people are buying these shares because they believe they can sell it shortly after for a higher price. This is what\u2019s going on in the stock market right now, which is how bubbles form.\n\n**Making Tendies in a Bubble**\n\nOkay, so you now believe, like me, that the stock market is now in a bubble, and has been in a [longer-term bubble for the last decade](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fzmlsv/spy_1125_150p/). Does this mean that I should sell all my long positions, buy puts, and short the market? Absolutely not. **Never short a bubble**. The whole idea of a bubble is that asset prices no longer reflect its intrinsic value, but is based on sentiment and speculation. Just because it\u2019s overvalued now doesn\u2019t mean it will immediately crash, and there\u2019s nothing stopping it from being even more overvalued in the near future; fundamentals aren\u2019t stopping it anymore. This has been the most clear the past week, with the first wave of COVID-19 cases never actually ending, bad vaccine news, and most US cities literally on fire, yet the stock market is skyrocketing for no apparent reason.\n\nInstead, my personal strategy is to play into this bubble, while holding a substantial amount of VIX calls as a hedge for when the stock market bubble eventually pops. I\u2019m holding VIX calls of multiple strike prices and expiry dates, mostly in Fall, since I personally believe the stock market will go back towards reality once more companies become insolvent (i.e. Fed can no longer help them), and a second spike in cases forces countries around the world to a second wave of lockdowns, as warned by most medical experts.\n\nIn the meanwhile, I\u2019ll be using Technical Analysis, which is most useful for markets on assets with no fundamentals and driven by pure sentiment, to drive my short-term and medium-term strategies. Some of you who have been following me for the past few weeks may know that my previous thesis revolved around SPY never breaking above 293 (+2%), which looked like it was going to happen until it didn\u2019t. This is because according to historical precedents, breaking above this level will bring SPY above the 62% retracement, and 200D EMA, and cause a 1W MACD crossover, which always resulted in a V-shaped recovery and new ATHs soon after. Of course, back then I believed fundamentals still mattered a bit and that this would not happen, but I was clearly wrong and it became clear we're in a short-term super-bubble within the longer-term bubble; SPY will be hitting new ATHs within the next few weeks.\n\nMy personal strategy for playing the bubble is the same as previous weeks, for those that have been following me - if the market is pricing in a V-shaped recovery, go long on the weakest and most beaten-down stocks that are not currently in bankruptcy, since those will be skyrocketing within the next few weeks as we see a rotation of capital from strong stocks like FAANG that have retraced back to their ATHs towards weak stocks, such as airlines, cruises, and banks. In other words, I'm literally inversing my strategy from a few months ago. Two weeks ago, some of these positions included CCL, JPM, and BA, which I entered into as soon as I saw their 1W MACD crossover, and have been doing phenomenally well last week. However, I have since exited BA and JPM and taken profit and rolled them into M, GE, WFC, and DAL, among other positions.\n\n[CCL, Daily](https://imgur.com/a/XZrR7kj)\n\n[BA, Daily](https://imgur.com/a/YXFkNji)\n\n[GE, Daily](https://imgur.com/a/RrZftMq)\n\n[DAL, Daily](https://imgur.com/a/7OrpvTa)\n\nMy strategy for these tickers\u00a0are simple - enter long positions (i.e. calls) as soon as they break the 24% retracement, which acted as a resistance for these industries until recently, and hence means that their stock price will skyrocket once it breaks it, and exit at the 50% retracements. BA and JPM have since hit these marks, so I exited. This week, I\u2019m holding calls from CCL, DAL, WFC, and GE, which has yet to have broken these levels. The market will probably need to consolidate next week because we\u2019ve had a lot of green days in a row, and it\u2019s getting pretty overbought, so I\u2019m not expecting these to print immediately. As I exit all of these positions and take profit, I\u2019ll be rolling half of the profits over towards more VIX calls for more hedging.\n\n# Live Updates\n\nAs always, I'll be posting some thoughts throughout the next few days in this thread below for people interested.\n\n6/7 8PM - Futures very green, especially /RTY, maybe the market is just gonna go for a 5th green day in a row with strong bullish momentum.",

        "selftext": "  \n\nBear season isn't over, and the market is about to get shafted. Here's why:\n\n1. JPOW\n\nThe fed talks recently confirmed the suspicion that the \u201cV-shaped recovery\u201d is a myth, and it\u2019ll take years for the economy to fully recover from this crisis. The feds could never outright say \u201cthe market is cucked\u201d, but they drop hints like these. In addition, inflation rates have decreased from 1.54% in March, to 0.33% in April, to 0.12% in May. We are dangerously close to deflation due to reduced consumer spending, and this is horrible for the economy/markets. \n\n2. Coronavirus\n\nThe fear of a second wave has obviously been around for a while, but it is recently picking up more steam. States like Arizona (who have been open for a while now) have reported a drastic uptick in coronavirus hospitalizations/cases. I know what you\u2019re thinking, with more testing means more cases\u2014which is true. But, more testing does not mean more hospitalizations. \n\n3. Overvaluation \n\nThe Buffet indicator is the composite market value of the market compared to the GDP. Levels over 30% are considered \u201covervalued\u201d, while levels over \u201c60%\u201d are considered \u201cstrongly overvalued\u201d. The last time the markets were considered over-valued was in 2000, during the internet bubble. Levels then were at 71%, and the market subsequently crashed. Currently, the indicator is at 74%.\n\n4. Hints from big money/institutions \n\nIt\u2019s funny how everyone on WSB shat on Buffet for selling his airline stocks at the bottom. Do you really think a bunch of RH autists know more than the smartest investor in the world? No. Furthermore, institutions have begun liquidating more assets, pulling more money out of the market. Again, who do you think knows more about the markets, you? Or the century-old, extremely successful \u201cbig money\u201d firms?\n\nPossible concerns: \n\n1. Trump pump \n\nIf the market gets cucked before his re-election, he stands almost no chance at winning. Trump will do everything in his power to continue pumping the market. We know that JPOW and bunker boy have big beef, and my concern is that orange man bullies JPOW into more Brrrrr and talk of negative yield rates. Trump even claimed he could instantly fire JPOW (which we know isn\u2019t as simple he says). This could continue to pump the market, extending the bubble further. \n\nTLDR: economy will take a while to recover, deflation occurring, market is overvalued, corona hospitalizations increasing, big money / Buffet dropping big hints to sell, but Trump might pump markets up. \n\nPlays: VXX calls, July expiry. Pick your poison with the strike price (whatever your RiSk tOleRanCe is). SPY puts, June/July Expiry. \n\nMy plays: VXX 7/10 45c. XLF 6/19 22p.\n\n\nEdit: furthermore, CCP is anticipating companies being delisted/prevented from being on American markets.

        "selftext": "There is a lot of confusion on how TFSAs work esp. in regards to contributions so here are the bare bones.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTFSAs were introduced in 2009 by Stephen Harper's government, to encourage Canadians to save.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe effect of the TFSA is that ordinary Canadians don't pay any income or capital gains tax on their securities investments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInitial uptake was slow as the contribution rules take some getting used to, but over time the program became a smash hit with Canadians. Apparently Canadians have about 700 billion in TFSAs and that figure will hit a trillion dollars within 5 years. There are about 20 million Canadians with TFSAs, so the uptake is about 80% (as you have to be the age of majority in your province/territory to open a TFSA).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasic TFSA rules are as follows:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStarting at 18 you get a certain amount of contribution room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAccording to the CRA:\n\n**You will accumulate TFSA contribution room for each year even if you do not file an Income Tax and Benefit Return or open a TFSA**.\n\nThe annual TFSA dollar limit for the years **2009 to** **2012** was **$5,000**.\n\nThe annual TFSA dollar limit for the years **2013** and\u00a0**2014**\u00a0was **$5,500**.\n\nThe annual TFSA dollar limit for\u00a0the year **2015**\u00a0was **$10,000.**\n\nThe annual TFSA dollar limit for the years **2016 to 2018** was **$5,500**.\n\nThe annual TFSA dollar limit for the year **2019** is $**6,000**.\n\nThe TFSA annual room limit will be indexed to inflation and rounded to the nearest $500.\n\nInvestment income earned by, and changes in the value of TFSA investments will not affect your TFSA contribution room for the current or future years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/contributions.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/contributions.html)\n\nIf you don't use the room, it accumulates indefinitely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTrades you make in a TFSA are truly tax free. But you cannot claim the dividend tax credit and you cannot claim losses in a TFSA against capital gains whether inside or outside of the TFSA. So do make money and don't lose money in a TFSA. You are stuck with the 15% withholding tax on U.S. dividend distributions unlike the RRSP, due to U.S. tax rules, but you do not pay any capital gains on sale of U.S. shares.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can withdraw \\*both\\* contributions \\*and\\* capital gains, no matter how much, at any time, without penalty. The amount of the withdrawal (contributions+gains) converts into contribution room in the \\*next\\* calendar year. So if you put the withdrawn funds back in the same calendar year you take them out, that burns up your total accumulated contribution room to the extent of the amount that you re-contribute in the same calendar year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nE.g. Say you turned 18 in 2016 in Alberta where the age of majority is 18. It is now sometime in 2020. You have never contributed to a TFSA. You now have $5,500+$5,500+$5,500+$6,000+$6,000 = $28,500 of room in 2020. In 2020 you manage to put $20,000 in to your TFSA and you buy Canadian Megacorp common shares. You now have $8,500 of room remaining in 2020.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSometime in  2021  - it doesn't matter when in 2021 - your shares go to $100K due to the success of the Canadian Megacorp. You also have $6,000 worth of room for 2021 as set by the government. You therefore have $8,500 carried over from 2020+$6,000 = $14,500 of room in 2021.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn 2021 you sell the shares and pull out the $100K. This amount is tax-free and does not even have to be reported. You can do whatever you want with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut: if you put it back in 2021 you will over-contribute by $100,000 - $14,500 = $85,500 and incur a penalty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut if you wait until 2022 you will have $14,500 unused contribution room carried forward from 2021, another $6,000 for 2022, and $100,000 carried forward from the withdrawal 2021, so in 2022 you will have $14,500+$6,000+$100,000 = $120,500 of contribution room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis means that if you choose, you can put the $100,000 back in in 2022 tax-free and still have $20,500 left over. If you do not put the money back in 2021, then in 2022 you will have $120,500+$6,000 = $126,500 of contribution room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is no age limit on how old you can be to contribute, no limit on how much money you can make in the TFSA, and if you do not use the room it keeps carrying forward forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can trade the following:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*stocks listed on an \"approved exchange\" which is the TSX, TSX-V, NASDAQ, NYSE, and about 20 other  exchanges worldwide, but not the US OTC pink sheets.\n\n\\*stock-like securities like ETFs and ETNs, including 2x and 3x leveraged\n\n\\*warrants\n\n\\*mutual funds\n\n\\*cash of any country\n\n\\*government bills and bonds of any country and most corporations\n\n\\*long puts and calls, and covered calls (short out of the money call and long the stock) but not option spreads\n\n\\* gold, silver bullion\n\n\\*shares in certain private companies -- but consult your tax advisor on this\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNothing inherently marginable like commodity, index or stock futures.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou cannot buy on margin in a TFSA. Nothing stopping you from borrowing money from other sources as long as within your contribution limits, but you can't trade on margin in a TFSA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis \"all-purpose\" flexibility is what makes the TFSA program so powerful, probably the most powerful program of its kind in the world, and Canada and the U.K. are the only countires that really have such a program.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe U.S. Roth IRA is superficially similar but much less powerful because contributions are limited by how much you make and there are age and purpose restrictions on withdrawing funds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe only other comparable program is the U.K. Investment Savings Account.",

        "selftext": "This is NOT DD but more so my speculation from scouring the internet and what I have discovered. **Interpret it as you'd like.** (This is also my first Reddit post, so please don't be too harsh)\n\nFor those that have performed DD, you know CEO Ted Murphy has been counting down to Friday, with the first mysterious message this past Sunday. These cryptic posts can be found on IZEA's Twitter and Instagram. Each message has had lyrics to Harry Belafonte's calypso song, *Jump in the Line (Shake, Senora)*.\n\n([Twitter](https://twitter.com/izea) \\---- AND ------ [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/izea/))\n\nAdditionally, with each message there has been a PR directly from IZEA or some sort of news:\n\n(Sunday:  [Zacks upgraded IZEA from Hold to STRONG-BUY](https://zolmax.com/investing/izea-worldwide-nasdaqizea-upgraded-to-strong-buy-at-zacks-investment-research/4246644.html))\n\nMonday: PR from IZEA  [Announces NEW Fortune 500 Customer](http://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/06/08/2045140/0/en/IZEA-Announces-New-Fortune-500-Customer.html)\n\nTuesday: PR from IZEA  [Announces New Contracts with TWO Fortune 500 Retailers](http://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/06/09/2045887/0/en/IZEA-Awarded-New-Contracts-by-Two-Fortune-500-Retailers.html)\n\nSO what is IZEA announcing Friday? Maybe revealing the *NEW* Fortune 500 customer. Maybe revealing the two Retailers that renewed contracts with IZEA, one of them a **Fortune 10** customer.\n\n[Current FORTUNE 10](https://preview.redd.it/83vzg0hu2z351.png?width=639&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d5904999c04eb786904c21c5a6e3626e79288c1)\n\nOn IZEA's [Customers landing page](https://izea.com/managed-services/our-customers/), Wal-Mart is (technically) the only current Fortune 10 company that previously has had a contract with IZEA. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pn2v0ffy2z351.png?width=995&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=471d7a737bf9826697169060a5e62a1baa2473ec\n\nHowever, we know that [Twitch and IZEA are already in bed together](https://izea.com/influencer-marketing/twitch/). And who owns Twitch? Yep, you guessed it...AMAZON. Could Amazon indirectly be the Fortune 10 customer because they own Twitch? Maybe. But Twitch is not on the above Customer's page which was surprising to me.\n\nThis brings me to the Jump in Line lyrics that have been used as captions on each of the Social Media posts so far. The song has had appearances in:\n\n1. [The Little Mermaid](https://youtu.be/5p6DUZUFC7E)\n2. [Beetlejuice](https://youtu.be/QooqZkNk8Bw)\n3. Even [Pitbull and T-Pain made their own version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmuKdoe8MvI) (screenshot of lyrics below so you don't have to listen to the song....)\n4.

That eliminates them from being the Fortune 10 customer. Have they had a previous contract with IZEA? I couldn't find anything publicly but did confirm [the CEO has consulted with Disney before](https://izea.com/company/leadership/ted-murphy/).\n\n* [IZEA HQ is in Orlando, a short drive from Disney World](https://izea.com/contact-us/orlando/) (Keep in mind that Walt Disney Co. is technically HQed in Burbank, CA)\n* A Live-action remake of the Little Mermaid, originally announced back in 2016, was originally scheduled to begin production in April 2020.

A sequel has been shelved as of April 2019.\n* One of the most memorable appearances of this song was in Beetlejuice during the climax of the movie.\n* Warner Music Group ($WMG) - On June 3, WMG officially had its second IPO on Nasdaq (went private in 2011), raising $2 billion with a valuation of $12.75 bilion.\n* Could there be some connection to WMG? Unlikely, since Harry Belafonte released all his albums with RCA Victor which is owned by Sony Music. With no sequel in the works and Sony owning rights to Belafonte's albums, it's hard to find a connection there.\n\n**T-Pain**\n\n* In a \"random\" social media post today, IZEA gave a shoutout to a past marketing campaign for  [Target and Trident Gum](https://www.instagram.com/p/CBN8qj5h0OB/) \n* I reached out to the users tagged on this post to find out how recent the campaign happened but received no responses.\n* HOWEVER, this past February, T-Pain had a pop-up performance in Chicago to unveil his partnership with Trident Gum and drive awareness to their new product Trident VIBES gum.\n* Yes, T-Pain was featured in Pitbull's rendition of Shake Senora, AND partnered with Trident Gum for this recent marketing campaign that IZEA spotlighted on its social media accounts TODAY.\n   * \"The campaign produced 41 pieces of content, 295k+ social interactions, and an engagement rate of 10.32% \ud83c\udfaf Instagram stories drove 11x more click through traffic to the coupon redemption page than Instagram photos in this campaign\"\n*  [Trident's IG post revealing T-Pain partnership](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9Xio9NhifB/) \n* This still seems like a stretch to me, but Target is actually on IZEA's customer's page (link above), right next to Wal-Mart....\n* **Apple**\n* This one seems furthest from likely, but I wanted to include all my findings.\n* In 2009, in season 8 of Dancing with the Stars, Steve Wozniak danced a Samba to this song.\n* It was terrible lol. He got a 10 out of 30, the second lowest score in the history of the show. \"It was the only dance that got 3s or less and was not the celebrity's final dance.\"\n* Steve Wozniak co-founded Apple with Steve Jobs and AAPL, as you know, is #4 in the FORTUNE 10.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, this leaves us with the perpetual question:\n\n# What does it all mean? \n\nWell, I don't fucking know.

        "selftext": "**Asset valuations**\n\nThere is a growing school of thought that the Fed and other central banks are driving an asset bubble when the evidence is wanting. In fact, I\u2019d go further than that and suggest that the Fed can stimulate away and should tolerate richer asset valuations yet.\n\n* First, on stocks, traditional relative measures that were recapped in yesterday\u2019s note showcase how stocks are not cheap but there is nothing particularly out-of-sample going on here. Yet investors are buying on a price relative to forward earnings basis over multiple quarters ahead in anticipation of a rebound. They\u2019re not buying stocks to get a claim on earnings this quarter (or lack thereof\u2026) or last quarter or even this full year\u2019s earnings that will be depressed by the first half experience. In fact, for the S&amp;P500, price compared to 2021 earnings expectations sits at about 20 times (chart 1). If the earnings rebound turns out to be anything close to analysts\u2019 expectations, then maybe\u2026.gasp\u2026stocks are cheap and nobody wants to say as much.\n\n* If so, then daily gyrations aside, stocks could have considerably more room to run. This runs counter to the common narrative that the Fed\u2019s stimulus is driving ridiculous stock valuations rather than viewing such valuations as based upon post-COVID-19 earnings expectations in a recovery (I\u2019ll come back to recovery evidence in a moment).\n\n* Second, given that the Fed looks at broad asset markets, we also need to do so. When I look at commodity valuations, we\u2019ve got a long way to go yet before we get to over valuation. Talked to the oil patch lately? Enough said.\n\n* Housing also doesn\u2019t seem over-valued. One gauge is homebuyer affordability that before the COVID-19 shock was only slightly more affordable than the two decade average. Another is repeat sales home price indices that were climbing by 4.4% y/y before the shock and well below the recent peak rate of growth in early 2018.\n\n* And then of course we have the Fed\u2019s preferred core PCE gauge of inflation that is likely to decelerate sharply over the faces downside risk over the duration of the year. Not only is evidence of asset inflation often overstated, it principally matters when it shows up in broad price signals and that\u2019s not likely to happen for some time.\n\n**Rebound expectations**\n\n* Equity analysts\u2019 earnings expectations are based upon underlying expectations for an economic rebound. In my opinion, there are already signs that the global economy is recovering and quite possibly going V-shaped which should inform a cautiously optimistic bias at the Fed. Heck, that\u2019s not even entirely a forecast as there is evidence that conditions are already headed there such that by the time GDP growth returns to the black in Q3 we\u2019ll already be well into recovery mode.\n\n* Look at the evidence. German restaurant bookings are soaring (chart 2). Chinese air travel has already recovered to well above where it was at the start of the year (chart 3). Global air travel is gradually recovering (chart 4). North American retail foot traffic is starting to recover, albeit out of a deep pit (chart 5). US homebuyer foot traffic is slowly inching higher (chart 6) and mortgage purchase applications have not only recovered the COVID-19 shock but are at levels seen well before the US economy shut down in mid-March (chart 7).\n\n* Is all of this durable? Some will argue this time is different and that we\u2019ll never return to the same activities. I wouldn\u2019t be so sure. As for second-wave COVID-19 risk, yes it\u2019s real, especially as reopening efforts gain speed and social inhibitions toward large gatherings so obviously decline. But will that stop the economy again? Probably not. One reason is that governments can\u2019t afford to do that all over again; to take on balance sheet the shut down economy again could risk deficits rapidly soaking up excess world saving and impairing the ability of companies and households to roll over debt from the last cycle. Governments across the world were running procylical fiscal policy with varying shades of abandon before the shock and this limited their flexibility to address this one.\n\nIs all of this durable? Some will argue this time is different and that we\u2019ll never return to the same activities. I wouldn\u2019t be so sure. As sophisticated as humans like to think we are as a species, we are not. We never change, or maybe we just adapt and move on by doing things differently, spending money in different ways or on different things with varying time periods toward a full recovery. History offers abundant evidence. I\u2019ve been doing this gig in one form or another for about a quarter century which is just barely enough time in the grand sweep of history\u2019s humbling lessons to have learned that every time a shock arises, we\u2019re told we\u2019ll never be the same again and things will never return to some sense of normalcy. We do. Every time that view turns out to be dead wrong. One of my favourite examples was when demographics best sellers told us during the early 1990s recession that an aging population meant fundamentally changed behaviour and we\u2019d never have another housing boom after the 1980s. Oops.\n\nCommentary from Scotia Bank: https://www.scotiabank.com/content/dam/scotiabank/sub-brands/scotiabank-economics/english/documents/closing-points/closingpoints_2020-06-09.pdf",

        "selftext": "**Abstract**\n\nHello all, today we are going to be discussing everyone\u2019s favorite meme stock, ~~Tesla~~ AMD! Before we get into the meat of the arguments for AMD and Intel, this is intended to be a follow up of another pretty crappy post I made a few months back, as such we will go into much further depth than before. Also I will not be providing price targets due to macro environmental circumstances.\n\nIn this post I will first have to cover some terms needed to talk about both companies\u2019 products, and some history. Then I will talk about how both are positioned in the present and the near term (next 6 months to a year), followed by long term speculation which I\u2019ll release later (next week maybe). Please note that I will briefly touch on NVIDIA and their products in the future speculation, but I will not go into depth due to there being a lot of misinformation circulating. I will most likely make another post doing a deep dive into the relation between NVIDIA, Intel, and AMD in late October/December.\n\n*Also note that I do not hold any shares or derivatives in AMD, Intel or NVIDIA.*\n\n**An introduction into the semiconductor industry**\n\nThe semiconductor industry is a massive industry currently valued at a massive 433b1, it is what powers all electronics ranging from the weakest smartwatch all the way up to the largest supercomputers. Semiconductors are made out of silicon oxide with transistors on them which perform logic functions and the likes. The semiconductor market has two large segments, that being the CPU market and the GPU market, with CPUs being used to compute a wide ranging set of data, whereas a GPU is used to perform lots of very repetitive tasks such as rendering. There are four primary companies in this space, that being Intel, AMD, NVIDIA, and ARM (note that Qualcomm and Samsung license their core architectures from ARM).\n\n*Some important terms that are needed to understand basic things that will affect performance/competitiveness.*\n\n1. Architecture: Refers to the design of a product think about it like how a house is built from a frame.\n2. Clock speed: How many cycles a CPU/GPU can perform, each cycle is the effectuation of a certain number of calculations.\n3. IPC: Instructions per clock refers to how many calculations a CPU/GPU can perform per clock cycle.\n4. Core: The \u201cprocessor\u201d in a CPU/GPU that performs the calculation\n5. Thread: present only in CPUs, allow multiple code paths to access a singular core at once thereby ensuring that the core is always fed with information.\n6. Monolithic design: A CPU/GPU using only 1 piece of silicon.\n7. MCM: Multi-chip module, a CPU/GPU that is composed of a multitude of pieces of silicon.\n8. Wafer: A disc of varying size in which the transistors are inlaid on, this will later be cut up into chips\n9. Chips: Smaller pieces of silicon which are typically a final product\n10. Node: Refers to how small a transistor is, measured in nano-meters (NM). Note however, it is more of a marketing term and the real size of the transistors are typically much larger, furthermore different nodes are intended to compete with each other, such as Intel\u2019s 10nm node being intended to be on parity with TSMC\u2019s 7nm node.\n11. Reticle limit: The maximum size a chip can be made on a certain node.\n12. EUV: Extreme ultraviolet, is the cutting edge of semiconductor manufacturing, uses high energy ultraviolet light to imprint the transistors on the wafer, allows for increased efficiency and better yields.\n13. Yields: Defect density of a wafer, if there is a defect on wafer the corresponding chip may be compromised and have to be thrown out or binned lower.\n14. Binning: The practice of sorting chips by how many defects they have, a chip with a lot of defects will have lower performance then one that has none.\n15. Cache: Small, low latency storage that allows for cores to quickly access data. Further divided into L1, L2, and L3 cache, with L1 cache having the lowest latency and lowest storage and L3 having the highest latency and the highest capacity.\n16. Memory/RAM: Fast storage that a CPU can directly access, note that it can not store as much data as traditional solutions, but latency and transfer speed are much higher. There are currently four generations of it, that being DDR1, DDR2, DDR3, and DDR4, with DDR4 being the newest. Memory also has clock speeds which indicates indirectly how fast the data transfer is.\n17. Fab/Foundry: Where wafers are made, the three largest ones are TSMC, Intel and Samsung.\n\n**A brief history of the relation between Intel and AMD**\n\nIntel was founded in 1968 by a few people you may know about, Gordon Moore, Robert Noyce, and Arthur Rock. Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce had left Fairchild Semiconductors with Arthur Rock providing the initial capital. Together the three made the first commercial CPU, the 4004.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nIntel 4004\n\nAMD was founded a year later in 1969 and initially produced memory, but in 1981 they entered in a 10 year partnership with Intel as a secondary supplier as requested by IBM. At the time, most OEMs required a secondary supplier to ensure that they would not become too reliant on one company and to ensure that they would have enough supply should one company have issues. This meant that Intel licensed their technology to AMD so they could produce them at their own fabs.\n\nThis partnership did not last long when in 1984 Intel broke the partnership, and violated the terms which in and after numerous appeals and cases of discovery abuse on the side of Intel resulted in the court's ruling in AMD\u2019s favor in 19902. Because of this AMD was forced to set out and create their own chips, initially copying Intel\u2019s 80C287, which would have been shared under the 10 year partnership. This resulted in Intel suing AMD for patent infringement, however the courts ruled in AMD\u2019s favour citing the previously mentioned case.\n\nAs the decade progressed, and the 2000s rolled around AMD came out with their own products, which handily beat Intel\u2019s own offerings, but the damage was already done. Intel was able to make so much money that they essentially had a monopoly on the CPU market.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nOld benchmark demonstrating AMD's advantage over Intel\n\nBut despite having the performance crown for about 7 years, their market share never came close to that of Intel, and the reason behind this would be revealed in 2009.\n\nIn 2009, the European commission fined Intel $USD 1.4b3. The reason behind this was Intel had bribed OEMs with cash incentives to not use AMD processors. This was to the point that Intel paid Dell 1b per year to not use AMD4. These bribes were so significant that when in 2006, in order not to be laughed out of business, they started to use AMD products, resulting in a massive 50% decrease in profit in 20065. That being said the damage was already done once again, and AMD was relegated to being a secondary competitor to Intel as they had simply run out of money. AMD released the Phenom in 2008, which was thoroughly crushed by the Intel competitors and after three years of refreshing the product with minor improvements, they released the horrible Bulldozer in 2011 which was legendary for its horrible performance, and insane power consumption. In 2016, they were near insolvency, with a share price bottoming out at 2$ per share.\n\nAll the while, Intel made small iterative performance upgrades while making all the money they could ever want. This is why your computer from 2010 is still very serviceable in 2020, 10 years later.\n\nIn 2017, AMD released their new Zen architecture with a massive 40%+ leap in IPC bringing it back into competition with Intel. Furthermore, Zen was an MCM design meaning that you could pair a few small chips to act as one large chip via Infinity Fabric, an interconnect that acted as the highways permitting multiple chips, or chiplets to communicate with each other.\n\n**Intel VS. AMD in the modern age**\n\nA lot has happened in the last 5 years. Currently, Intel\u2019s technology portfolio is a complete and utter disaster, rife with stagnation. For example, Intel\u2019s primary product, Intel\u2019s current offerings are a mere 7% better in applications that only use 1-2 cores, than those of AMD\u2019s while using 50% more energy and having vastly inferior in the increasingly important applications which leverage more than four cores. Intel\u2019s highest end desktop product, the w3175x, coming in at 3k only has 28 cores, whilst the highest end AMD cpu the 3990x, has over double at 64 cores. The performance disparity is clear, AMD is the only viable option for productivity. The story continues in servers where Intel is outclassed in a similar manner to that of the desktop with performance on the AMD side being well over 200% higher. The slaughter continues into laptops where AMD\u2019s 4900HS, completely embarrasses the highest end Intel competition while consuming \u2153 the power. The only performance crown that Intel can claim is gaming, and even then it is a mere 7% higher, due to extreme clock speeds with their newest architecture, when compared to AMD\u2019s design, which is over a year old.\n\nThere are multiple reasons why Intel is so behind in performance, the primary being nodes. Intel\u2019s 10 nm node was slated to launch four years ago. Four years is a very long time for any company, especially for the semiconductor space, and the sole reason why Intel was not severely punished for these stagnations was that they were miles ahead of any competitor. Earlier on I mentioned that AMD had fabs and was a secondary supplier, however as they were approaching insolvency, they sold off their fabs and partnered with Global Foundries, and later TSMC. However TSMC ramped the 7 nm, which was designed to compete with 10nm, extremely fast, handedly taking Intel\u2019s previous position as owning the most advanced fabs. Looking at Intel\u2019s road map, volume 10 nm will most likely hit the market by 2021, if there are no further delays, but TSMC is not sitting still, they are also innovating with the 5 nm, which was designed to compete with Intel\u2019s 7nm hitting markets in 2020. If Intel does not get 10 nm functioning by 2021, it will spell the end of Intel\u2019s fabs. TSMC will be not one, but two nodes ahead of Intel.\n\nThis is also compounded, though to a lesser extent by there being little to no IPC improvements in 5 years, meaning that AMD was free to catch up and in many cases surpass them.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin when it comes to Intel in the near term is their security vulnerabilities. Before 2018, all security vulnerabilities were mainly from software attacks, but that changed with the discovery of Meltdown and Specter. To show how important these issues were, let me illustrate an example. *Say you are a CEO of a major investment firm (lol), and you are using Intel servers to do whatever you need to do, you go about your day, the server is 100% secure from a software standpoint. Night comes, and you decide to look at how profitable your company was this quarter (again lol), but on the front page you see \u201cMajor leak at X company all confidential data was leaked,\u201d you panic and call up your IT guy and he is in a panic, the head lines are correct all company data stored on any server that you own has been leaked and there is nothing you can do about it.* That is the danger of these vulnerabilities. There is absolutely nothing you or your staff could have done, and worse yet, there are over a dozen similarly dangerous vulnerabilities, and over 600 more minor ones. The only way to try and prevent these leaks are to apply patches from Intel, but this results from anywhere between a 10% to a 60% loss in performance, which needs to be made up by buying new servers as you are already at 90-100% capacity. Then you hear that a certain company, AMD, was immune to this attack and their products are vastly superior. This is the major issue plaguing Intel at the moment. For the time being you will see a major rise in server sales as people scramble to buy up servers to remain operational, but in time they will switch to AMD, with AMD forecast to take 10% in Q2 20206, up from near 0% in 2016.\n\n**Intel VS. AMD in the near future**\n\nAt the moment AMD is uniquely positioned, their competition has yet to compete truely with their 1 year old tech, and they are on track to release brand new CPUs this year in late Q3/Q4. As a warning, we are entering grounds of speculation, but do note that this speculation is based on reliable leakers like AdoredTV7 (correctly leaked entire AMD CPU product stack from last year with only minor errors), Moore\u2019s Law is Dead8 (correctly leaked entire CPU product stack form Intel that was released this year with near 0 errors thus far).\n\nAMD: Intel  \n(New product titled Zen 3, releasing this year) (New product released this year)\n\n16 cores with 32 threads N/A\n\n12 cores with 24 threads 10 cores with 20 threads\n\n8 cores with 16 threads 8 cores with 16 threads\n\n6 cores with 12 threads 6 cores with 12 threads\n\nThings to remember\n\n\\- Zen 3 \\~13-15% IPC bump7, with maybe 100ish MHz clock speed bump7, which will allow AMD to claim the final performance crown of gaming from Intel, this coupled with Intel being nowhere in sight will allow AMD to reign supreme in all faculties for a while.\n\n**Final thoughts**\n\nAMD is in an excellent position to capitalize on Intel\u2019s stagnation. The security flaws could have not come at a better time, accelerating the world\u2019s adoption of AMD CPUs and their new products will beat Intel in gaming thanks to the IPC and clock speed increase improving their gaming performance by at least 15%. Overall, Intel is a precarious spot, that being said they have vast sums of cash and they had a few key developments in the past few years which could allow them to catch up in 2022 or 2023. I will discuss that possibility in a later post along with an analysis of how AMD will perform in the GPU market with consoles on their side.\n\n1.

        "selftext": "There seems to be a lot of misinformation around Electra Meccanica (SOLO)\u00a0 so I thought I would share my findings with the group.\n\nSOLO is based out of Vancouver, Canada, where I am from, and\u00a0 is co-founded by their COO/President Henry Reisner.\n\nHenry and his family started in the car Business in the 80s when they founded the company intermeccanica which created high quality Porsche speedster replicas. From my understanding Intermeccanica is still a separate company owned by the Reisner family but they are closely connected to SOLO.\u00a0\n\nThe replica Porsche company has been and still is extremely successful and the family has actually written a book about how they developed the company.\n\nI have actually met with Members of the Reisner family at the international Vancouver auto show where they had their SOLO vehicles on display. They are car people and mentioned how it was extremely important that car people would enjoy how their handles which makes sense with them being Porsche people.\n\nFrom what I understand they made a lot of money to start the company by selling electric versions of their porsche speedster which Bill gates is seen driving around in with Warren Buffet :o\n\nThe product that could potentially make this company\u2019s worth increase greatly is their 1 seater called the solo.\u00a0\n\nThe Single seater has been in small scale production in Asia already and they have a small fleet of those cars already built which can be seen in their Vancouver showroom.\u00a0\n\nAs many have heard their CEO is looking for a production plant in Arizona and other states and we have already seen what a fake press release of a new production plant can do.\n\nThe Largest risk to the company in the short term is IMO is the possibility of not securing a US production site as expected\n\nThe company also has value because to my understanding they are actually producing their own technology and electronics as they are scooping up Phd electrical engineers in the past few years and still are. Companies like rimac who have also developed tech like their received revenue by selling tech to larger car companies who need a fast way into electric cars which is a growing market.\n\nTLDR:\n\nPros:\n\n* Lots of preorders for single seater\u00a0\n* Established Electric Porsche speedster Line (w customers like bill gates and warren buffet )\n* Very likely to soon close on a production facility for Preorders\n* A press release of production facility will Bring us to the moon\n* Good proprietary technology\u00a0\n* Good Driving cars (They are actually car enthusiast not just a group of hippies)\n\nCons:\n\n* Possibility that they may fail to secure a production plant\u00a0\n* IN the long term when the Solo car comes out it may not be perceived well\n\nOverall I think this company is definitely a steal the short term as it should definitely at least reach it\u2019s pre covid levels of about $2.50 and  MUCH higher if they secure a production plant. This company Probably won't be the new tesla but I definitely think some good press about their cars once production starts could really push the company up to the moon\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nAlso if this gets on jay Lenos garage \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83c\udf19 \n(Had to have emojis in there)\n\nReferences:\n\nBuffet and Gates in car:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQWkNXr2ujI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQWkNXr2ujI)\n\nPre Orders:\n\n[https://electrameccanica.com/electra-meccanica-announces-vehicle-pre-orders-now-exceed-64000-units/](https://electrameccanica.com/electra-meccanica-announces-vehicle-pre-orders-now-exceed-64000-units/)\n\nProduction plans and car Info:\n\nhttps://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/\\_d6e0f90ec1740fc6d44522270bb3bc3f/electrameccanica/db/354/2669/pdf/SOLO+June+2020+Investor+Presentation.pdf\n\nInvestor site:\n\n[https://investors.electrameccanica.com](https://investors.electrameccanica.com/)",

        "selftext": "# Hey everyone, here is my take on SNAP (NYSE). Pls let me know your thoughts (supporting/ conflicting) etc. or if there's anything else I need to cover. This is just my opinion of the stock and I could definitely go into way more detail...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## \ud83d\udd25\u00a0Investment Thesis\n\n1. Snapchat has the potential to become the first Western Super App\n2. Snapchat is a bet on innovation, and that innovation wins in the end\n3. Snapchat is leading the way with augmented reality and is a long-term hardware play\n\n#### (1) Snapchat has the potential to become the first Western SuperApp\n\n* On June 11th, Snap announced **Minis**. These are micro applications that third-party devs build for people to use inside of Snapchat.  \n\n   * Snap is starting with 7 Minis with some big partners including Headspace (meditate with friends) and Coachella (coordinate your festival line-up with friends).\n* We can look at the success and misfortunes of other companies who have launched micro applications to see if this is a good move for Snap:  \n\n   * **Bull Case: Snapchat replicates** [**WeChat\u2019s success with Mini Programs**](https://melchers-china.com/wechat-mini-programs-a-rapidly-growing-trading-channel-in-china/)  \n\n      * Mini Programs launched on WeChat in 2017\n      * By August 2019, there were 2.36 million WeChat mini-programs\n      * In 2019, over 300 million people had spent a collective [$115B](http://routenote.com/blog/tencent-made-115-billion-just-from-wechats-mini-apps-in-2019/#:~:text=Tencent%20revealed%20the%20news%20that,expand%20the%20platform%20in%202020.) through WeChat Mini Programs\n      * Chinese research agency Kueclub and Tencent Research &amp; Development found 40% of 8000 research respondents believe they will completely replace standalone apps one day\n      * Since announcing WeChat Mini Programs in [December 2016](https://chinachannel.co/try-wechat-mini-programs-now/), Tencent (owner of WeChat) stock has increased over 130%\n   * **Bear Case: Snapchat follows the sad path of iMessage apps\u2026**  \n\n      * These are small apps that you can access through iMessage on iPhone\n      * Developers seemed to [lose interest](https://www.macrumors.com/2017/03/16/developer-imessage-apps-fading/) in 2017 after 6 months.\n      * Hasn\u2019t grown much beyond Sticker packs\u2026 and certainly nowhere near as big as WeChat Mini Programs\n* My Take:  \n\n   * **Evidence of Success:** Snap has killed it since opening its platform up to developers. Out of [800 apps integrated with Snapkit](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200611005151/en/Snap-Announces-New-Developer-Products-Partnerships-Snap), 20 are in the top 100 of the app store at the moment. Snap Games have also seen a successful start with over [100 million users](https://venturebeat.com/2020/06/11/snap-hits-100-million-players-teams-with-zynga-and-launches-more-chat-games/) since they launched last year. I expect similar success for Snap Minis, and ultimately for them to follow the path of WeChat.\n   * **Snap becomes stickier:** If Minis are successful, it\u2019ll make Snapchat very sticky. Why would people leave the Snap app when so many other convenient services are offered on it? Snap previously made their app sticky with Snap streaks, and now they\u2019re going to make it even more so with Snap minis.\n   * **Growth opportunities:** If everyone is using Snap Minis to plan, shop, and socially book tickets together, non-users will be persuaded to download Snapchat to access these programs specifically.\n   * **Revenue diversification:** Snapchat has a huge opportunity to diversify revenue beyond adverts and brand partnerships, by taking a cut of revenue spent through e-commerce Snap Minis (see above: $115BUSD spent through WeChat mini-programs in 2019).\n\n### (2) Snapchat is the most innovative social media company\n\n* This is pretty clear from all the news articles released about Facebook copying everything Snapchat does\n* Snapchat was [**FastCompany\u2019s most innovative company of 2020\u2026**](https://www.fastcompany.com/most-innovative-companies/2020) a list that also placed Tesla, Shopify, Beyond Meat, and Spotify in the top 15.\n* It\u2019s worth reading more about this [**here**](https://www.fastcompany.com/90457684/snap-most-innovative-companies-2020)\n\n### (3) Snapchat is leading the charge with Augmented Reality and is a long-term hardware play\n\n* **Leading the charge into Augmented Reality:**  \n\n   * According to Mordor Intelligence, the Augmented Reality market is expected to have a CAGR of [152%](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/augmented-reality-market) between 2019 and 2020, and the user base for AR technologies is also expected to grow beyond 1 billion by 2025.\n   * Researchandmarkets.com is more bearish, estimating the [size of the AR market](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200515005267/en/Global-Augmented-Reality-Mixed-Reality-Market-Growth) to only grow at 44.74% (still ridiculously high) to USD 27.44 billion by 2025, up from USD 2.98 billion in 2019.\n   * Snap is positioning itself to take a large proportion of the consumer-facing AR market.  \n\n      * More than [170 million](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-11/snap-says-170-million-use-its-augmented-reality-tools-daily) people use Snapchats Augmented Reality tools daily\n      * Snap recently announced an AR tool called Scan that allows people to digitally interact with anything they see with their iPhone camera  \n\n   * Snap was rated as the #1 most innovative VR/ AR company of 2020 by Fast Company, and if they can use this to capture a large proportion of the consumer AR market (27.44B in 2025 - see above), their revenue and valuation could be off the charts in the medium - long term.\n* **Long-term hardware play**  \n\n   * Following the iPhone and subsequent Android smartphone releases in the past decade, AR glasses have long-believed to be the next major hardware step in computing that will change the way we interact with the world\n   * Evan Spiegel (Snapchat CEO) believes we are unlikely to see mainstream AR glasses for another 10 years\n   * In an interview, Evan Spiegel stated  \n*\u201cSpectacles, because they\u2019re a new type of camera, they\u2019re still event-based in terms of usage. You go on a really cool trip, you\u2019re playing with your kids, whatever it is \u2014 and you want to represent that moment in a totally new way, from your perspective in 3D. So for now, I do think it\u2019s going to continue to be an event-based product.* ***But what\u2019s really exciting is that over time, we\u2019ve seen the capacity for these cameras to evolve from event-based products to products that are used all day long. So, I think we\u2019re just on that journey with Spectacles****. And we\u2019re fortunate that we can continue to invest along that path to get there.\u201d*  \n\n      * While open to interpretation, this could mean that Snapchat is investing in Snap Spectacles, with the aim they will eventually become AR glasses armed with Snapchats AR software to compete with [Apple\u2019s much-anticipated equivalent](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-glasses/).\n   * **EVEN MORE INTERESTING:** On top of Snap\u2019s augmented reality software capabilities, Snap has also announced\u00a0[voice-enabled](https://mashable.com/article/snapchat-voice-scan-lens-finder/)\u00a0lenses called Voice Scan. This is similar to Apple\u2019s Siri or Amazon\u2019s Alexa.  \n\n      * Voice could potentially be used as a control-mechanism for AR glasses later down the track\n   * **My Take:** AR glasses seem to me like an inevitability, however, whether or not Snapchat create them is a pretty huge speculation. However, the upside of this speculation could be **ridiculous**. Using the case of Apple and the iPhone as an example:  \n\n      * There are currently [728 million iPhones ](https://www.statista.com/statistics/755625/iphones-in-use-in-us-china-and-rest-of-the-world/)in use around the world\n      * When Apple announced the iPhone on the 9th of January 2017, its stock price was [$11.94](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/apple-stock-price-in-the-10-years-of-the-iphone-2017-6?r=US&amp;IR=T)USD. Since then it has appreciated over 2500% to $352.08USD. Apple\u2019s market cap was less than $80B when it announced the iPhone, today it is $1T.\n      * If AR achieves a similar reach, then the dominant AR hardware company could see similar success to this.\n\n## \ud83d\udc4eRisks\n\nNo investment is without risks.\n\n* Many people believe Superapps will [fail in the Western world](https://blog.prototypr.io/why-chinas-super-apps-will-never-succeed-in-the-us-64c686c8c5d6), so Snapchat Minis won\u2019t succeed in a big way.  \n\n   * Western world and Asia do have incredibly different internet ecosystems with China effectively jumping straight to mobile\n   * Snap has had recent success with its Snap Kit and Snap Games, however, only time will tell\n* Snapchat is dying and will be replaced by the next social network  \n\n   * Snap still reaches more 13-34-year-olds in the US than Facebook or Instagram. It also reaches more users in the US than TikTok and Twitter combined.\n   * Snapchat growth has significantly underperformed [Instagram](https://www.statista.com/chart/15034/worldwide-user-growth-of-instagram-and-snapchat/). However, it would be worth to look into where the growth comes from (age and country demographics).\n   * It is entirely possible that the next social network could be built on top of Snapchat ([Hoop](https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/hoop-snapchat-app/), [Wink](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/wink-make-new-snap-friends/id1482681335), [YOLO](https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/08/download-yolo-app/) are some of the fastest-growing consumer apps and are all heavily reliant on Snapchat)\n   * Snap isn\u2019t afraid to acquire the next social network, having previously acquired [Bitmoji](https://www.bitmoji.com/) and [Zenly](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.zenly.locator&amp;hl=en_AU)\n* Snapchat has Facebook copying everything they do  \n\n   * [Evan Spiegel doesn\u2019t seem too worried about this](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/evan-spiegel-says-facebook-copying-their-popular-features-is-the-most-fantastic-feeling-ever/articleshow/64379256.cms) so long as Snapchat remain innovative and ahead of the park  \n\n      * *\u201cIf you can create something that is so beautiful and simple that the only thing other people can do is copy it exactly, that is the most fantastic feeling. It is the most fantastic thing in the entire world.\u201d*\n* Snapchat won\u2019t become profitable  \n\n   * One of the biggest tests for Snap will be figuring out a monetization model beyond advertising. No one has cracked this outside of China yet, and Snap\u2019s messaging network of close friends makes it possibly the best positioned to do so.\n* Snap spectacles suck..  \n\n   * They do suck, but as mentioned above they could simply be a step in the process of getting to full AR glasses.\n* Snap is already huge ($23B company), it won\u2019t grow much more  \n\n   * Snap has the long-term potential to be the size of any of the top consumer tech companies. Apple $1.47T (51x Snap), Google $964B (33x), Facebook $653B (23x) and Netflix $184B (6x).\n* Before investing, make sure you read Snapchat\u2019s prospectus and yearly reports to see more risks.\n\n## Current valuation\n\n* Amongst the 35 analysts that cover Snap, the average target price is $18.66\n* At the current price, the consensus is Snapchat is marginally overvalued. However, with plenty of positive information being released at the Snap Partner Summit, this could change when analysts next update their ratings.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n* Worth digging deeper if you\u2019re a patient investor, looking to buy and hold for the long-term (minimum 5-10 years)\n* Could crash again like in 2018 if Snap fails to execute mini-apps etc. or if young generation has a fundamental shift to another social network\n* *Disclosure: I\u2019m long SNAP through underlying equity, but not that long\u2026 it represents a very small proportion of my overall portfolio.

Many converted, many asked questions and many made tendies. then Boom! the Kang Gang was born!\n\n[Kang Gang](https://www.reddit.com/r/KangarooGang/)\n\n[WSB CNBC Post with picture](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h7u3ea/breaking_cnbc_officially_gives_up_stocks_enter/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)\n\nThe Autists that made this possible,\n\nu/suitology, u/A-Ronyells, u/bobsagetsmomma, u/theCramps, u/newanonthrowaway,\n\nKangaroos plays are options. *If you want to hold a stock, go over to* [/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/).\n\n**Options Strategies :** *Basic definitions, if you want to learn more click the link and research for yourself, I am not your mom here to spoon feed you.*\n\n**Straddles:** A straddle is a neutral options strategy that involves simultaneously buying both a put option and a call option for the underlying security with the same strike price and the same expiration date.\n\n[Straddles](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/straddle.asp)\n\n**Strangles:**  A strangle is an options strategy where the investor holds a position in both a call and a put option with different strike prices, but with the same expiration date and underlying asset. A strangle is a good strategy if you think the underlying security will experience a large price movement in the near future but are unsure of the direction. However, it is profitable mainly if the asset does swing sharply in price.\n\n[Strangles](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strangle.asp)\n\n**Butterfly Spread:** A butterfly spread is an options strategy combining bull and gay bear spreads, with a fixed risk and capped profit. These spreads, involving either four calls or four puts are intended as a market-neutral strategy and pay off the most if the underlying does not move prior to option expiration.\n\n[Butterfly](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/butterflyspread.asp)\n\n**Iron Condor:**  An iron condor\u00a0is an options strategy created with four options consisting of two puts (one long and one short) and two calls (one long and one short), and four strike prices, all with the same expiration date. The goal is to profit from low volatility in the underlying asset. In other words, the iron condor earns the maximum profit when the underlying asset closes between the middle strike prices at expiration. *For those Roo's who want to keep shoving tendies in their pouch, during times of low Volatility*\n\n[Iron Condor](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ironcondor.asp)\n\n**Options Plays:**\n\nThe Kang Gang is a sucker for Volatility, This is our favorite play.\n\n[Volatility (VIX)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vix.asp)\n\n**Funds:**\n\n* S&amp;P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (VXX),\n* S&amp;P 500 VIX Mid-Term Futures ETN (VXZ),\n* VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (VIXY),\n* VIX Short-Term ETN (VIIX).\n\n*or if your a real fucking Kang Gang go big and play the with the big dick Roo's*\n\n\\&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Daily Inverse VIX Short-term ETN (XIV)\n* Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (SVXY),\n* Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (UVXY),\n* Daily 2x VIX Short-Term ETN (TVIX),\n* Daily Inverse VIX Medium-Term ETN (ZIV)\n\n**Stonks:**\n\nAnything and everything, sometimes even hedging, As long as you have Calls and Puts on the underlying stock. *(usually VIX)*\n\n**Kang Gang is chill AF!**\n\nWhile we hop on in the daily thread and watch the Bulls and Bears meltdown over \"the LEG DOWN\" or \"LEG UP\" we chillin and know we ain't worried.

        "selftext": "*TL/DR: I'm bearish because of the looming unemployment, the market is already overbought, the fed can't fix every part of the economy, and because of the political and social unrest this year already has and will continue to bring. Would love to hear and discuss counter arguments.*\n\nI've been hearing countless arguments, first from the bears that COVID was undoubtedly the start of the next Great Depression, then from the bulls that were laughing at the bears because J Powell cancelled the recession and the V shape recovery is looking pretty good.  So here we are, 3 months later and the market is heading back toward the all time highs of February.\n\nI can understand a lot of the bulls argument and the \"don't fight the fed\" mentality. Right now, there really isn't a better place to stash your money than stocks. However, if we really sit down and think about what has already happened and what is on the way for the rest of this year, I truly can't see this momentum going through 2020 and into 2021. I still have some individual positions that I will continue to hold, but I am considering putting a lot of money into an inverse S&amp;P500 ETF (SH, SDS, SPXU) and watching as the next year unfolds. My bear argument for the next year:  \n***1)*** ***Unemployment:*** Unemployment is currently sitting at 40 million Americans. Recent study from the University of Chicago ([here](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/20/most-americans-see-layoffs-as-temporary-but-research-shows-otherwise.html)) says that 42% of those people won't have jobs to come back to. Even being conservative on the study and assuming 25%...that is 6 million people permanently unemployed. \n\nEvery company and industry has had to learn to adapt to at home work for the last 3 months, and that's going to cause a lot of companies to take a look at what jobs are really necessary to function and likely leave lower skilled Americans without jobs.\n\n***2) Market was already overbought before COVID and still is:*** Pretty straightforward on this one, coming into 2020 the market was already seriously overbought after the 11 year bull run and was due for a correction. It got a massive correction, but now is right back into overbought territory. PE is 23 and Shiller PE is 28.73 (median is 15.78)...a correction at these levels seems likely even without COVID. Low interest rates have made stocks the only game in town which is why they are being flooded into, but that does not make a lot of these companies well-run businesses worthy of their current valuation. Balance sheets and cash flows matter, and eventually investors are going to expect to see earnings, and a lot of these high flying \"COVID stocks\" won't be able to provide them.\n\n  \n***3)*** ***\"Unlimited\" QE can only do so much:*** I know, don't fight the fed. The fed can print money, but it can't create demand and jobs. If my case about unemployment and overbought markets are even halfway true, the feds printing is only a band-aid that will eventually have to be taken off.\n\nWe also don't really have a great idea of what \"unlimited QE\" even really means or looks like. Does it mean infinite from a dollars scale and/or a time scale? Does this unlimited QE only apply to what the fed considers COVID related issues, or will they just have to keep printing like this in 5 years or 10 years for any decline? Essentially I feel like the market is being completely propped up by the Fed, but that printing cash doesn't actually generate demand and *genuine* cash flows for a company\n\n  \n***4) Political and Social Unrest:*** This is the one that everyone knows about and almost jokes about at this point. Another set of bad news and the market roars higher. How sustainable is it really?\n\nI believe that COVID alone was enough to drag down the market substantially...but we have so much more going on than just COVID. \n\nWe have a President of the #1 economy who blames COVID directly on the #2 economy in the world...which will almost guarantee there is no trade deal happening with China anytime soon. With COVID, Hong Kong, and Trump, the situation with China will only deteriorate as the years go on. \n\nWe have an election year with arguably the most controversial president of all time who is going to use all means necessary to win or defraud the election. Either Trump wins another 4 years and we trust him to rebuild us in a post-COVID world, or he loses and very likely creates what will certainly be a democratic crisis. How many people truly see him going away peacefully? All we need is a couple of close states and \"fake news, election fraud\" are all over his Twitter and Fox News and we have a genuine crisis on our hands. Can't imagine this November-January being pretty in either scenario.\n\nSocial unrest is here to stay. People are furious right now and the cities aren't just burning because of one thing (although police brutality toward African Americans is a MAJOR issue) but because of YEARS of mistreatment and a system that does not work. The system is rigged against those in the bottom, the wealth gap has been growing for years, and I feel that these protests, pushed further by Trump, is society's way of showing that this just isn't sustainable. The masses at the bottom are demanding a true change. I'm not sure if they're going to get it or not, but I'm pretty confident they won't between now and November.\n\nSo...all that being said...I'm shorting the market using inverse ETFs. Who agrees?",

After this report was released, Huawei attempted to obfuscate it's dealings with Skycom leading to another detailed report being released in March of 2013.  (The [2012 report](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-huawei-hp/exclusive-huawei-partner-offered-embargoed-hp-gear-to-iran-idUSBRE8BT0BF20121230) / [2013 report](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-huawei-skycom/exclusive-huawei-cfo-linked-to-firm-that-offered-hp-gear-to-iran-idUKBRE90U0CA20130131) respectively). \n\nIn response to the Reuters articles released in 2012 and 2013, several banks questioned Huawei about its relationship with Skycom. This included HSBC, where both Huawei and Skycom held bank accounts.\n\nIn the U.S. indictment, specifically, Meng is being charged for participating in fraud involving HSBC. But this was a point of contention since the representations she made weren't technically criminal under Canadian law, i.e. no sanctions. What was criminal, however, and what ultimately led to Meng being charged is the actual act of making fraudulent misrepresentations, which is criminal in both the U.S. and Canada as well. ([The full 36 page Supreme Court ruling if you're interested in reading](https://www.scribd.com/document/463254844/2020-BCSC-785-United-States-v-Meng))\n\n**Expected Outcomes**\n\nMoving forward, I think the primary question we have to consider now, is what exactly is going to happen once Meng is extradited to the United States. Were it any other case, this would be a pretty clear cut white collar fraud cause. Of course, this isn't just any case, and the context of the trade tensions between the U.S. and China as well as ongoing geopolitical issues like with the Hong Kong protests, all have to be taken into account.",

        "selftext": "# Oh Snap!\n\n\ud83c\udfa7\u00a0*If you prefer listening to reading, you can listen here:* [*Oh Snap! (Audio Edition)*](https://notboring.substack.com/p/oh-snap-audio-edition)\n\nIn 2012, I invested in Facebook at around $19 per share. In 2013, I sold it for $45. I thought I was a genius. Since then, though, Facebook is up another 5x - I missed out on most of the gains. Back then, people were unconvinced that Facebook could do mobile well. Once they did mobile well, people doubted that they could increase the ad load in the mobile News Feed in order to sustain growth. Wrong again. Facebook has built one of the two best advertising businesses in human history.\n\nWhat I learned: when you think you\u2019ve found the next big platform, don\u2019t worry about the little things. Invest in it, don\u2019t trade it.\u00a0\n\nOver the next five years, Snap has the potential to be as big as today\u2019s biggest tech companies. Becoming the next platform is a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and I think Snap is best positioned to be that platform.\n\nThe stakes are high. The chart below shows the market caps of today\u2019s biggest consumer(ish) tech companies, which provides a rough estimate of the upside in Snap if it\u2019s able to take advantage of the opportunity ahead of it.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xz6pncz553551.png?width=3388&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e4d794f9ec92850bc4be48ced683093b3063199\n\nSnap has had a rough go of it as a public company, and most of us kind of forgot about it. I\u2019m putting everyone back on alert.\u00a0\n\nI haven\u2019t been as excited about a company as I am about Snap in a long time. It checks some major nerd boxes for me:\u00a0\n\n\u2705 **Hype Cycles**: We are catching Snap at the right time, as it\u2019s heading up the Slope of Enlightenment. Others will slowly begin to wake up to Snap\u2019s potential, you heard it here first.\n\n\u2705 **Worldbuilding:** Spiegel and Snap are patiently laddering towards a long-term vision so big that most people missed it.\n\n\u2705 **Mirrorworld:** Snap is building the next major platform - Augmented Reality. Aside from being a lot of fun, AR presents an internet-scale financial opportunity.\n\nWhile most of us were distracted, Evan Spiegel built a new world. Today, Snap is weaving together a complex and defensible suite of products, technology, content, and SDKs that position it to build the next big platform - the one that blends the physical and digital worlds.\u00a0\n\nIf you, like me, missed it, don\u2019t worry. We\u2019re not alone. Scott Galloway declared \u201c[The End of Snap](https://medium.com/s/no-mercy-no-malice/no-mercy-no-malice-the-end-of-snap-tesla-af4499558ce0)\u201d in October 2018. Ben Thompson hasn\u2019t written seriously about the company since [last July](https://stratechery.com/?s=snap), after writing about it almost monthly between 2015 and 2019. There\u2019s a good reason, too.\u00a0\n\n### The Hype Cycle\n\nI want to take you back to a time when the only app on our Nokia phone was Snake, when Britney Spears\u2019 *...Baby One More Time* was #1 on the charts, and one of my all-time favorite movies was released. That movie, *She\u2019s All That,* has a lot in common with Snapchat.\n\nIn case you haven\u2019t watched *She\u2019s All That* recently, I\u2019ll give you a quick rundown.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nZack (Freddie Prinze Jr.) starts the movie as the most popular guy in school, but falls from grace when his girlfriend breaks up with him. In an effort to gain back popularity, he accepts a bet with his best friend Dean: that he can turn Laney Boggs, a dorky art student, into the Prom Queen. Against all odds, and after a persistent effort, Zack and Laney start to like each other, and it looks like Zack might win the bet *and* the girl. But then Dean (*traitor!*) reveals that Zack only asked her to win a bet.\u00a0\n\nZack and Laney break up. They\u2019re both at a new low. Zack takes his sister to prom, and Laney\u2019s planning on skipping altogether until Dean shows up and takes her. Laney loses the Prom Queen crown to Zack\u2019s ex, Taylor, and goes home, where\u2026 ZACK IS WAITING FOR HER!!\u00a0\n\nThey fall in love again by the pool. They kiss. It\u2019s one of the most romantic scenes in cinematic history.\u00a0([You can watch it here](https://youtu.be/GdrDuVImE2c))\n\nAt graduation, we are left with the impression that the best days are ahead for Zack and Laney. And we cry happy tears, and those tears come back any time we hear [Sixpence None the Richer\u2019s \u201cKiss Me\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8N-qO3sPMjc). (Wait, just me? Embarrassing.)\n\nZack and Laney\u2019s journeys look something like this:\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/joi5rv5b53551.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd4287bfb77ae0f23994c3ab5c1216cc68f3768f\n\nCool, so we\u2019ve established that I love *She\u2019s All That*. What does any of this have to do with Snap?\u00a0\n\nWell, hidden beneath those screen grabs is a chart that will be familiar to you if you\u2019ve been reading Not Boring for a while: the Gartner Hype Cycle. According to Gartner itself:\u00a0\n\n&gt;*Gartner Hype Cycles provide a graphic representation of the maturity and adoption of technologies and applications, and how they are potentially relevant to solving real business problems and exploiting new opportunities.*\u00a0\n\nMore simply, Gartner Hype Cycles describe the fact that many technologies, industries, and products come out of the gate hot with an initial use case, get really popular for a little while, then fade as that initial use case fails to live up to the hype. At that point, some products just die - countless flash-in-the-pan apps fall into this category - while others find real practical applications and rise from the ashes to provide ongoing value.\u00a0\n\n**Rocketship to the Peak**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0j6goe7c53551.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d3936e7944084e97e5eefe1085c2c02afbacc7e\n\nSnap certainly fit the left side of the chart. Triggered by cameras on every phone and ephemeral messaging (hence the Ghost logo), Snap shot up to the Peak of Inflated Expectations quickly. Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown ([we don\u2019t talk about him](https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/02/snapchat-reggie-brown/)) launched Snapchat as \u201cPictaboo\u201d in July 2011. By October 2012, Snapchat users were sharing 20 million images per day. By November 2013, two-year-old Snapchat had users sharing 350 million photos per day, and Spiegel reportedly turned down a $3 billion acquisition offer from Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook.\u00a0\n\nSnapchat was a rocketship, even if, or because, it was viewed as just a [sexting app](https://techcrunch.com/2012/05/12/snapchat-not-sexting/). This whole [timeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Snapchat) is worth checking out, but suffice it to say, Snapchat grew spectacularly from its 2011 founding through its March 2, 2017 IPO. Its stock closed at $27.09 the next day, good for a $39 billion market cap. Turns out, though, that three years later, $27.09 is still SNAP\u2019s all-time high.\u00a0\n\n**Elevator Down to the Trough**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/69bwws5d53551.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f84103b592ced1ba560bcf8c1218d81a3e62976d\n\nI remember the SNAP IPO distinctly, because I remember all of our parents asking whether they should buy SNAP. We thought it was way overvalued for a photo messaging app, and it turns out, the market agreed. SNAP\u2019s stock price tumbled 81% from its March 2017 high of $27.09 to an all time low of $4.99 on December 21, 2018. In September 2018, [Recode cited four reasons](https://www.vox.com/2018/9/16/17861692/snap-stock-decline-explained-user-growth-evan-spiegel) for the fall:\u00a0\n\n1. **Slowing Business Growth:** Snap was slow to bring advertisers onto the platform, causing analysts to cut their revenue estimates by 50%.\u00a0\n2. **Increased Competition:** Instagram Stories copied Snapchat, and used Facebook\u2019s distribution to eclipse Snapchat\u2019s Daily Active Users (DAUs).\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uu9jzs2e53551.png?width=764&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc6879855aa2d1f49ee264c8cc5eab80f8d94edb\n\n3. **Losing Users.** Snap redesigned its app in early 2018, pissing off important users. Kylie Jenner\u2019s tweet about the redesign caused SNAP\u2019s market cap to drop $1.3 billion in a day, and Snapchat lost 3 million DAUs in Q2 2018.\n\n[https://twitter.com/KylieJenner/status/966429897118728192?s=20](https://twitter.com/KylieJenner/status/966429897118728192?s=20)\n\n4. **Executive Departures.** Between the IPO and the Recode article, Snap lost its CFO, CSO, VP of Product, VP of Sales, VP of Engineering, and General Counsel. Those executives\u2019 compensation was heavily based on the sagging stock price.\n\nThis is right around the time that Galloway called \u201c[The End of Snap](https://medium.com/s/no-mercy-no-malice/no-mercy-no-malice-the-end-of-snap-tesla-af4499558ce0)\u201d and that Thompson stopped writing quite so frequently about the company (I count 10 articles in 2017, 6 in 2018, 4 in 2019, and 0 in 2020). I\u2019m guilty here too. I\u2019ve written about all of Snap\u2019s contemporaries, but I haven\u2019t talked about Snap. I didn\u2019t hear a lot about Snap and I wasn\u2019t receiving snaps, so I kind of forgot about it. Even when I asked people who have opinions on every company for their opinions on Snap for this piece, I got a lot of, \u201cI don\u2019t knows\u201d and \u201cI haven\u2019t thought much about Snap.\u201d\u00a0\n\nWhat I missed, though, is that I didn\u2019t hear about Snap as much as competitors like TikTok *by design*. TikTok is the greatest virality engine ever built; Snap doesn\u2019t want to go viral. I just tried to Snap something and share it broadly, and I couldn\u2019t figure out how to do it. So while us olds sleep on Snap from the outside, millions of younger best friends spend their entire lives communicating in there. We all underestimated Evan.\u00a0\n\n**Underestimating Evan**\n\nHitting the Trough of Disillusionment is the make or break moment for a company. From down there, the journey up the Slope of Enlightenment is far from guaranteed. Most once-buzzy social companies don\u2019t make it out the other side. RIP Yo, Yik Yak, and Whisper.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u4dhiphi53551.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88329d208be21637e7f2dfa59977306805fba581\n\nGalloway, and many others, predicted that Snap would go the way of Yo, Path, and Myspace. If it was lucky, maybe Disney or Amazon would buy it.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: I think what defines whether a company makes it through the Trough of Disillusionment or not is whether there\u2019s a Worldbuilder or a Shotcaller at the helm.\u00a0\n\nThe companies that fail after the initial hype were Shotcallers: they only had one product in mind and they ran at it hard, backed by big venture dollars. The Yo guys really thought that sending \u201cYo\u201d to each other was the future, communication in its simplest form. When that didn\u2019t work, there was no backup plan.\u00a0\n\nEvan Spiegel didn\u2019t even cross my mind when I was writing [*Two Ways to Predict the Future*](https://notboring.substack.com/p/two-ways-to-predict-the-future), but he really should have. **Evan Spiegel is a Worldbuilder.**\u00a0\n\nIn *Two Ways to Predict the Future*, I wrote that Worldbuilders have three things in common:\u00a0\n\n1. They predict something non-obvious about the way the world is moving before others see it and before the market is ready for their ultimate vision.  \n\n\n* For Spiegel, this was that the camera was going to be the way we all communicate and interact with the world.\n\n1. They create a wedge into the market and leverage it into a much larger opportunity. The public often ridicules or dismisses the initial wedge product.\u00a0  \n\n\n* This one\u2019s too easy. Everyone dismissed Snapchat as a sexting app.\n\n1. They timestamp their vision, whether in public announcements or confidential documents.\u00a0  \n\n\n* This [2018 company-wide memo](https://cheddar.com/media/snap-ceo-evan-spiegel-company-memo-on-2019-strategic-goals-and-profitability) from Spiegel clearly lays out (parts of) the plan, and this tweet from former Snapchat employee Lucy Guo shows that Spiegel has been working on recently-announced Snap Minis for at least four years.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7[**Lucy Guo** @lucy\\_guo@dtrinh Seeing Evan execute his plans 4 years later is heartwarming. I remember when I first heard him brainstorming this and thought \u201cWow, this guy really is a product visionary\u201d](https://twitter.com/lucy_guo/status/1271593254098579457?s=20)\n\n[June 13th 2020](https://twitter.com/lucy_guo/status/1271593254098579457?s=20)\n\n[**28** Likes](https://twitter.com/lucy_guo/status/1271593254098579457?s=20)\n\nWorldbuilders are rare. Bezos, Musk, Carta\u2019s Henry Ward. When you find one, you bet on them. I\u2019m a little late to the party, but not *too* late. Snap is right at the beginning of the climb up the Slope of Enlightenment.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x0futf4k53551.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c83516790b71840e319babfa6eae08a86b34b61\n\nI\u2019m now convinced that when its journey is complete, it will be one of the biggest, most important companies in history.\u00a0\n\n### So What is Snap Building?\n\nIf you\u2019re a Worldbuilder, one of the advantages of being in the Trough of Disillusionment is that it gives you time out of the spotlight to build your world. Over the past year or so, as measured by [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2011-01-01%202020-06-12&amp;geo=US&amp;q=snapchat), Snap had less public interest than it has since early 2015.\u00a0\n\nOver the past two months, though, the new Snap emerged, with two big events driving renewed interest in the company:\u00a0\n\n1. Gangbuster Q1 [earnings](https://investor.snap.com/news-releases/2020/04-21-2020-210949737) and user growth that sent shares up 37% in one day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/seh9ed1l53551.png?width=739&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=571d6cc6e2397a7e195312fd318e83b6f9c5a30b\n\n2. Thursday\u2019s Partner Summit 2020, *in Augmented Reality (AR)*, renewed excitement and convinced me that Snap is the leading contender to make AR real.\n\n[https://youtu.be/BfvubHha69k](https://youtu.be/BfvubHha69k)\n\nLast week, in [*Business is the New Sports*](https://notboring.substack.com/p/business-is-the-new-sports), I wrote about the power of keynotes and product launches in rallying fans around a brand, using Steve Jobs and Elon Musk as the canonical examples. Evan Spiegel and Snap took the torch on Thursday.\n\n[Turner Novak](https://twitter.com/TurnerNovak), who has understood Snap better than anyone [for](https://turner.substack.com/p/a-deep-dive-on-snaps-content-business) [a](https://turner.substack.com/p/how-the-snapchat-redesign-could-affect) [long](https://twitter.com/TurnerNovak/status/1092852491178442754?s=20) [time](https://twitter.com/TurnerNovak/status/1048790251601313793?s=20), wrote a [thorough summary of the event](https://turner.substack.com/p/snap-partner-summit-2020-recap-and), which you should check out, in addition to just watching.\n\nWatching the Summit unfold, I felt like Charlie in *It\u2019s Always Sunny.*\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3a5ygq9n53551.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b75399aecffa834383dbf99969e0f5043741c003\n\nBefore watching the Summit, I thought of Snap as a social media company, a competitor to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, and the rest. It\u2019s not though. Snap isn\u2019t just building a camera-first messaging app; it\u2019s building the platform of the future. It\u2019s building mirrorworld.\u00a0\n\n**Welcome to Mirrorworld**\n\nIn February 2019, Kevin Kelly wrote one of the most thought-provoking essays I\u2019ve read: [*AR Will Spark the Next Big Technology Platform -- Call it Mirrorworld*](https://www.wired.com/story/mirrorworld-ar-next-big-tech-platform/). In it, Kelly describes a digital world mapped 1:1 with the physical world, which we can interact with, experience, and manipulate just like the real world. Mirrorworld, according to Kelly, won\u2019t take place in Virtual Reality (VR), but rather in Augmented Reality (AR). It will blend digital and physical, layering bits\u2019 infinite possibilities on top of atoms\u2019 *realness*.\u00a0\n\nMirrorworld means being able to reproduce that [Travis Scott Fortnite concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYeFAlVC8qU) in a park instead of our basement, with real people, whenever we want, or looking at a restaurant from the street and being able to see the menu and pictures of the dishes. It means having a full suite of digital tools available to enhance our physical experience.\u00a0\n\nIt also means a big business opportunity. The first platform of the digital age was the web. The second was social media. The third, according to Kelly, will be mirrorworld.\u00a0\n\n&gt;*We are now at the dawn of the third platform, which will digitize the rest of the world.* ***Whoever dominates this grand third platform will become among the wealthiest and most powerful people and companies in history****, just as those who now dominate the first two platforms have. Also, like its predecessors, this new platform will unleash the prosperity of thousands more companies in its ecosystem, and a million new ideas\u2014and problems\u2014that weren\u2019t possible before machines could read the world.*\u00a0\n\nKelly points to Microsoft (Hololens) and Magic Leap ([uh oh](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-11/augmented-reality-startup-magic-leap-is-said-to-explore-a-sale)) as the two leading contenders to build mirrorworld.\u00a0\n\nHe doesn\u2019t mention Snap once. But watch this video. What does it make you think of?\u00a0\n\n[https://youtu.be/4jA1RM5\\_WMc](https://youtu.be/4jA1RM5_WMc)\n\nWatching that clip gave me chills. Qi Pan, the Snap Computer Vision Engineer narrating the video, says about Local Lenses:\u00a0\n\n&gt;*Now, Snapchatters can join a persistent, shared AR world built right on top of the physical one. You and your friends can step into these worlds together, collaborating creatively and experiencing a whole new dimension of AR.*\n\nThey\u2019re building fucking mirrorworld!\u00a0\n\n**Snap\u2019s Ladder to Mirrorworld**\n\nWhen I said that Evan Spiegel was a Worldbuilder, I meant it literally. And when you think of Snap as the company that\u2019s building mirrorworld, everything starts to \\*snap\\* into focus.\u00a0\n\nBack in March 2016, when Ben Thompson still wrote about Snapchat, he wrote [Snapchat\u2019s Ladder](https://stratechery.com/2016/snapchats-ladder/). In it, he compared Snapchat to Netflix, in that both were executing \u201cladder-up\u201d strategies: a series of moves that build off of each other with the end goal in mind from the beginning. It\u2019s like a Worldbuilder starting with an unassuming wedge and trading up en route to the ultimate goal.\u00a0\n\nFor Snap, to Thompson, that means starting with Snaps, then building Stories, then Discover, then Feeds and Optionality. The ladder he described built up to \u201cowning messaging in the United States.\u201d\u00a0\n\nWhat Thompson didn\u2019t grasp - nor could anyone outside the company - is that those three rungs were just the first three rungs on a ladder dozens of rungs high. At the top of the ladder, high above \u201cowning messaging in the United States,\u201d is mirrorworld, with Snap as the platform powering it all.\u00a0\n\nTo climb the ladder, Snap is employing the Amazon \u201cFirst and Best Customer\u201d strategy. It builds products for its own app first - like Lenses, its first AR hit - and then opens up the tools to both its community to create within Snapchat, and third-party developers to incorporate Snapchat\u2019s features into third-party apps.\n\nSnap is building a wide-ranging set of products that build off of each other and work together to lead to a future in which Snap powers the mirrorworld. It\u2019s big and complex, so let\u2019s start small. Bitmoji gives a glimpse into Snap\u2019s foresight.\u00a0\n\n**Bitmoji - Those Are Those Stickers That Kinda Look Like Me, Right?**\n\nSnap [acquired Bitstrips](https://www.wsj.com/articles/snapchat-buys-bitmoji-app-for-more-than-100-million-1458876017), the creators of Bitmoji, in March 2016. Thompson thought it was smart because Snap might be able to monetize Bitmoji by selling stickers to Snapchatters and selling companies the ability to create branded stickers. Snap\u2019s plans were much bigger. Now, Bitmoji is a key part of Snapchat\u2019s Chat, Snap Games, Snap Map, and Weather products.\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s how the \u201cfirst and best customer\u201d strategy works at Snap: first, they build for Snapchat, then they open up to 3rd party. Product, then platform. It\u2019s a flywheel.\u00a0\n\nFirst, Snapchat made it really easy to send Bitmoji through the app, pulling new users into the product and retaining existing ones. The first time I used Snapchat was to create my Bitmoji. Now, through [Bitmoji Kit](https://kit.snapchat.com/bitmoji-kit), Bitmoji is available in 3rd-party Android and iOS keyboards, *giving Snapchat reach into nearly every smart mobile device on the planet*.\u00a0\n\nSimilarly, Snap first used Bitmoji in Snap Games, and has now opened up Bitmoji to be used by 3rd party game developers, giving Snapchat a presence in games far beyond the ghost icon.\u00a0This map shows Bitmoji\u2019s reach within Snap and in 3rd party products.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dvn3pl4r53551.png?width=1415&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=311da4c52804c2e5e07486e5798ee2a5e928d235\n\nSnap even built its recently announced Minis - little apps built right into its Chat - on top of its game infrastructure. It\u2019s not difficult to imagine Minis one day being available in all of the keyboards where Bitmoji currently live.\u00a0\n\nBitmoji is Snap\u2019s friendly tentacle into a universe of 3rd party apps and a testing ground for mirrorworld. And that\u2019s *just Bitmoji.* Until like three minutes ago, most of you thought they were just silly cartoons.\n\n**The Camera Company**\n\nSnap\u2019s Camera is an even more powerful platform than Bitmoji, and the main one on top of which they\u2019ll build the mirrorworld. The evolution of Snapchat\u2019s Camera is deserving of an essay in itself, but if you strip away a lot of the complexity (and brilliance) it can be expressed as a ladder.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hlqu5u2s53551.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10b69bcfcc415853e8e1d991c05257b472465f3f\n\nFrom humble beginnings as a camera that may or may not have been used primarily to send dick pics, Snap has built one of the most broadly distributed pieces of AR technology in the world. In some ways, mirrorworld is already here: over 135 million people create AR with Snap every day. And with the announcement of Camera Kit, which allows 3rd party developers to integrate Snap\u2019s Camera into their apps - transitioning the Camera from a product to a platform - that number will rise.\u00a0\n\nCombined with the announcement of Local Lenses, soon millions of people in hundreds of apps will be able to digitally transform the physical neighborhoods in which they live and the way they appear in them.\n\nInstead of Shotcalling - building out the full suite of hardware and software and pushing it onto users - Snap is building the platform on which Snap, its users, and partners will build the mirrorworld together.\u00a0\n\n**And Snap Has the Right Users for a New Platform**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kopf88zs53551.png?width=791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbbe0a47d96170a7f9824a95016a83367c080cdf\n\nSnap has a big, engaged base of users who are the right age to pioneer a new technology platform. It\u2019s in the sweet spot - it has been around long enough to have a large user base, which is necessary to create enough adoption for a new platform, while its users are young enough (and geographically dense enough) to adopt a new spatial platform.\u00a0\n\nTo that end, two stats from the Partner Summit blew my mind:\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dcpfj7st53551.png?width=1137&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5ed6eaea1755517f0d9a30d9e2d84a2ba0b0324\n\nBecause Snap is not designed for virality, it\u2019s really difficult for an outsider to realize just how big it is with this key demographic. On a [September 2019 ](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/talks-at-gs/evan-spiegel.html)[*Talks at GS*](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/talks-at-gs/evan-spiegel.html)[ podcast](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/talks-at-gs/evan-spiegel.html), Spiegel highlighted his user growth strategy: don\u2019t worry too much about attracting older users, just **keep its users engaged while they get older and continue to attract new young users**. Despite the pressure on him to grow DAUs - which he could do by making the product friendlier to older and/or international users - Spiegel realized something magical that Matthew McConaughey\u2019s character in *Dazed and Confused* summarized so succinctly (and creepily):\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tvu5bfmu53551.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e492dc9f946c1ff0819efa6c068dbc412ecd519\n\nBoomers and even older Millennials won\u2019t be the early adopters of a transformative new platform. Just as my Pop Pop wasn\u2019t among the first people to adopt the internet, and my mom wasn\u2019t one of the first people on social media, I won\u2019t be one of the first people in mirrorworld. Snapchat owns the people who will be: young Americans.\u00a0\n\nBecause its users are Gen Z and younger Millennials who appreciate Snap\u2019s values, it can say and do the right things now and build long-term trust with them. Spiegel kicked off the Partner Summit with words of support for the protestors, and his team introduced four new docuseries featuring a black cowboy, the world\u2019s most popular fighter, a transgender hair stylist, and two gay black friends. Facebook can\u2019t do that.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gxa1q5kv53551.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5995a9ee4103566831d35e1d58c8cbfa98a2e14\n\nSnap is on the right side of history, particularly in the eyes of its young demographic. Mirrorworld will be more intertwined with our lives than any previous platform; that level of trust is crucial.\u00a0\n\n### Snappy Conclusion\n\nBecause there are so many pieces to the Snap puzzle, I feel like I\u2019m still just scratching the surface. In addition to the suites around Bitmoji and Camera, Snap also boasts **Minis, Snap Map, Local Business Listings, Voice Control**, **Snap Originals, Happening Now, Ad Kit, Story Kit, Creative Kit, and Login Kit,** and I\u2019m sure I\u2019m missing some.\n\nSnap might be the first American company to become a WeChat-style super app. Its mobile-first streaming business puts Quibi to shame and is approaching Netflix\u2019s US viewership. 125 million people interacted with its news service last year. Through Snap Kit, it powers 20 of the top 100 apps in the iOS and Google Play Store. The Snap Map is a crucial lens into the heart of the protests, offering unfiltered and unbiased views on the ground.\u00a0\n\nAnd we didn\u2019t even talk about any of those products in this piece.\n\nEven if we can\u2019t see it yet, these are not just standalone products. Snap has shown that its products connect in ways that are not obvious to outsiders. Who would have thought that personalized cartoons would serve as a Trojan Horse into games and mobile operating systems?\u00a0\n\nI started untangling and retangling all of the ways that Snap\u2019s products could work together to power the AR platform of the future, and if I can get that map to a legible place, I\u2019ll share it. Without seeing the full picture yet, though, I can already see something beautiful and powerful emerging.\n\nBy spinning a web of connected products, each building and feeding off of the others, Snap has built moats that will make it impervious to feature theft. When it all comes together, Snap will be one of the most important companies in the world.\n\nBusiness is the new sports, and I\u2019m jumping on the Snap bandwagon.\n\nIf you want to read the original, check it out here: [https://notboring.substack.com/p/oh-snap-](https://notboring.substack.com/p/oh-snap-)",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 15th, 2020.\n\n# **After big sell-off, stock market will be wary of virus and Fed testimony in week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/12/after-big-sell-off-stock-market-will-be-wary-of-virus-and-fed-testimony-in-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to reassure markets next week the central bank will do whatever it takes to help the economy heal. That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks could be caught in a tug-of-war in the week ahead, as investors weigh the potential positives of a reopening economy against worry that the coronavirus continues to spread. \n*****\n&gt; In the past week, the S&amp;P 500\u2032s sharp gains briefly drove the index into positive territory for the year, before a bruising sell-off at the end of the week. Stocks were more than 47% above the March 23 low before investors got spooked by signs the coronavirus is picking up in some areas. \n*****\n&gt; The Fed also dampened sentiment when it released economic forecasts Wednesday that showed a slow recovery and interest rates at zero through the end of 2022. Investors will hear more of the same when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks before Congress this Tuesday and Wednesday in his semi-annual economic testimony. He may provide more clarity on the Fed\u2019s bond buying and other policy moves.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales for May are released Tuesday, and that will be an important look at consumer spending activity. It is the most important data in the coming week, other than the weekly jobless claims report on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks rose on Friday with the S&amp;P 500 up more than 1% after Thursday\u2019s sharp sell-off that sent the index down nearly 6%. Treasury yields, which move opposite price, also moved sharply lower as investors moved to the safety of bonds. The 10-year yield was back to 0.70%,  well off the high of 0.95% in the week earlier.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve been overbought for awhile and digesting gains would be natural,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said the fact that 97% of the S&amp;P 500 companies\u2019 stocks were above their 50-day moving average this past week was a warning. The 50-day moving average is a momentum indicator, and if a stock or index rises above it, it is usually a positive, but if they all do, it\u2019s a contrarian warning.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cHistorically that\u2019s just too high ... and also the P/E on the S&amp;P was 25.1 of forward 12-months earnings, which is a 52% premium to the P/E average since 2000,\u201d he said. The P/E, or the price-to-earnings ratio, is an important tool to value stocks, and it averages around 16.5 times.\n*****\n&gt; In the sell-off, stocks that would benefit from the economy\u2019s reopening were the hardest hit. Investors had been jumping into those names, driving them higher at a dizzying pace. They were also the sectors that were last to join the rally, like banks, casinos, airlines and hotels.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOnce the pullback runs its course I think investors will move back again into the sectors and subsectors that were most beaten up in the bear market,\u201d said Stovall.  \n*****\n&gt; Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com, said he lightened up his holdings earlier in the week. \u201cThere were some clues early in the week that the market was vulnerable, like when the S&amp;P closed below 3,191 on Tuesday. You had some feverish trading in some of the very speculative names,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said other headwinds hang over the market, and one big one is the upcoming presidential election, which could become a bigger influence on the market. RealClearPolitics has President Donald Trump trailing former Vice President Joseph Biden by 8.1 points in the latest average of polls.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cTrump\u2019s numbers are just looking so bad, and if the Fed needs to keep interest rates at zero and we have the potential for a resurgence in Covid cases, then Trump is not going to benefit from an economic recovery, and as a result, that gives Biden a better chance of being elected,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily that the market dislikes Biden, but they dislike uncertainty. And a decline in equity prices would be representative of that uncertainty.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Consumer barometer\n&gt; Retail sales are typically a barometer for consumer spending, and when Americans were shut in their homes they did much less shopping than usual. April data showed a 16.7% drop in sales, but consumers did spend online.\n*****\n&gt; Economists are watching Tuesday\u2019s report on May sales closely, particularly after the May jobs report had a large upside surprise. There were 2.5 million jobs added in May, instead of an expected loss of 8.3 million.\n*****\n&gt; Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, said business-to-business spending data for May implies that retail sales were flat compared with April\u2019s depressed level and could be down 22% from a year ago.\n*****\n&gt; Zandi used data from Cortera, which collects information on about $1.5 trillion in business-to-business spending. In an analysis of spending by retailers in May, it found there were gains from April in some categories, including furniture, gasoline stations and restaurants.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cClothing and sporting goods store sales have been crushed, and that continued in May.  Restaurants,  gasoline stations and furniture stores have been hit hard, but showed strong improvement in May. Food and health and personal care stores have done well through the crisis, but gave some of that back in May,\u201d notes Zandi. \u201cOnline retailers, general merchandise stores (which includes WalMart and Target), and building material and garden supply stores (Home Depot and Lowes) have navigated the crisis well, and May was another solid month.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Zandi said weakness in apparel and sporting goods washed out the gains in other areas.\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead \n&gt; Strategists said Powell did not surprise the market with his comments this past week, but his sober approach reminded investors that the Fed policy will have to be in place for a very long time to pull the economy out of its deep rut. That will keep markets on high alert during his two days of testimony.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the cat\u2019s out of the bag. I don\u2019t think he can sugarcoat it. The thing he\u2019s got to worry about is he needs help. He needs Congress and the administration to come up with another fiscal rescue package. He can\u2019t do it on his own,\u201d said Zandi. \u201cHe has to keep the pressure on them and get a piece of legislation before they go on August recess.  ... He\u2019s speaking as much to the American people as he is to the policy makers.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Zandi said the Fed has acted aggressively and swiftly to unfreeze credit markets when they locked up in March, but the economy needs more stimulus ahead of a wave of potential business defaults and with a high level of unemployment. The Fed\u2019s balance sheet has ballooned to $7.2 trillion, and on Wednesday the central bank committed to monthly purchases of $80 billion in Treasury securities and $40 billion in mortgage securities.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think he continues to lay the foundation for policy changes to come,\u201d  said Zandi. \u201cHe\u2019s strongly suggesting there\u2019s going to be more monetary support, and that would come in the form of a few things - it would be performance dependent forward guidance. ... He\u2019s going to make it clear until the economy is at full employment and inflation is at least at target, if not above.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Zandi said Powell may discuss yield curve controls, which would mean the Fed would set targets for interest rate levels in the Treasury market, and make purchases to influence rates. Some economists believe the Fed  will adopt that tool before the end of the year.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think he\u2019s going to more clearly define the amount of QE they\u2019re doing going forward. He\u2019ll try to preserve some optionality, but he\u2019ll try to make it known, they\u2019re buying a lot of bonds for a long time to come,\u201d Zandi said.\n*****\n&gt; But the hearings could be more politicized, and Powell may be criticized by Congress for helping financial markets more than Main Street, said John Briggs, head of strategy at NatWest Markets. \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if there\u2019s a lot new, given it comes on the heels of the FOMC meeting,\u201d Briggs said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/pw0CUi2.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/fP1CK0o.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/UO6j0gC.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/GImgVgH.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JYCJeEm.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qcLni34.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/iC1YmSV.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qsph2Sm.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vM5brmK.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/LscP3vHv/ipos12.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/1Y2bHjI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/hrsZdEH.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Is This The Start Of A New Bear Market?\n\n&gt; \u201cStocks take an escalator up, but an elevator down.\u201d \u2014 Old investment axiom\n\n&gt; The saying above sure happened yesterday. In the end, the S&amp;P 500 Index fell 5.9% for the worst day since March 16 and the first three-day losing streak in more than three months. What does it mean? We\u2019ve been on record that we expect some type of well-deserved pullback or at least consolidation after the 45% bounce off of the March 23 lows and the best 50-day rally ever. Then add in the fact that June has been the worst month of the year for stocks since 2000 and some type of weakness is perfectly logical here and now.\n\n&gt; \u201cIn many ways, this is one of the most overbought stock markets we\u2019ve ever seen. Now the catch to this is previous times we\u2019ve seen major levels similar to now have been closer to the beginning of bull markets than the end of bull markets,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; This is now one of the greatest surges off a major low ever. It is perfectly normal to see a drawdown of double digits after the initial surge weakens. This could be happening now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We\u2019ve shown that huge up months like April tend to eventually resolve higher, but some near-term weakness is possible.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Also, when more than 90% of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are above their 50-day moving average, this shows solid longer-term results. Again, suggesting that very overbought isn\u2019t always a bad thing.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; There was a huge spike in stocks marking new monthly highs, again historically an overbought signal. This opens the door for some near-term weakness, but is a very positive sign longer-term.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Last, in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 was recently more than 13% above the 50-day moving average, one of the highest levels ever. The good news is one-year later stocks were higher every single time. Yet another clue that historically overbought isn\u2019t always a bad thing for the bulls.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; A record run, over-the-top excitement from small traders, the Nasdaq at 10,000, historically high multiples, and seasonality all could be a factor in why a pullback here could be perfectly normal. In fact, if you are bullish, after a 45% rally, one of the best things would be for prices to reset some here over the coming months. We would be a buyer of weakness and use it as an opportunity for longer-term price appreciation.\n\n*****\n\n# Persistent Volatility Runs Into Resistance &amp; Exuberant Sentiment\n\n&gt; We have all been gobsmacked by velocity and strength of this V-shaped rally off the March 23 bear market low. For the record this rally became an official Ned Davis Research defined bull market on May 26 when DJIA was up 30% from the low when it made a new recovery high after 50 calendar days (see NDR definitions below). And this was on the back of the shortest bear market on record, which lasted only 40 days. Today\u2019s market comeuppance is an important reminder that we need to be patient with this market and heed our cautious analysis and stance.\n\n&gt; This is still the \u201cWorst Six Months\u201d and as we warned in the May Outlook when the market is down during the \u201cBest Six Months\u201d (November-April) as they were in 2020, the \u201cWorst Six Months\u201d (May-October) were down or flat 86% of the time with a median S&amp;P decline of -6.7% since 1950.\n\n&gt; Other seasonal indicators are also flashing the caution sign. This year\u2019s negative January Barometer and breached December DJIA low, point to possible retests of the lows and choppy, volatile trading over the next several months. See the updated composite graph of the seasonal pattern for these 22 years since 1950 in the June Outlook.\n\n&gt; It appears that quite a fair amount of hope was built into the rally. Lots of hope that everything is just going back to the way it was real soon. But COVID cases are on the climb again and folks are concerned that a pause and/or reverse of reopening could delay the economic recovery and derail the bull. Up until the past few days it felt like mid-February again with the market ignoring economic and corporate data as momentum pushed everything higher.\n\n&gt; The jobs report was a bit unbelievable and then Fed Chairman Powell\u2019s candor and reserved outlook at yesterday\u2019s press conference put the fear right back into the market today. Meanwhile the Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDPNow model currently estimates that 2020 Q2 GDP growth will be down -48.5%.\n\n&gt; Sentiment had also become rather exuberant as the Weekly CBOE Equity Only Put/Call ratio we track in the \u201cPulse of the Market\u201d hit 0.43 last week \u2013 its lowest level since the week ending 4/10/2010 about three weeks before the infamous flash crash. Investor\u2019s Intelligence Advisors Sentiment survey Bullish advisors are now up to 56.9%. Correction advisors are down to 22.5% while Bearish advisors have slipped further to 20.6%, putting us at caution levels.\n\n&gt; Technically, things deteriorated rapidly today. After blasting through several levels of resistance we have been tracking as shown in the chart here S&amp;P 500 stalled at 3210 and plunged 5.9% today through 3115 support/resistance and closed just below 3010 support/resistance which sits at the 2019 summer highs. The next major support level below here is 2725 right near where the 50-day moving average turned up in mid-May, which would be a 15.7% correction from the recent recovery high reached this past Monday, June 8.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7d877af1643a7342c0c8622cbc763c92/eb566818257f08b5-2b/s500x750/8228cad8989a5456266c3f0d753168c4d3c3efec.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Ned Davis Research bull and bear market definitions:\n\n&gt; A cyclical bull market requires a 30% rise in the DJIA after 50 calendar days or a 13% rise after 155 calendar days. Reversals of 30% in the Value Line Geometric Index since 1965 also qualify. A cyclical bear market requires a 30% drop in the DJIA after 50 calendar days or a 13% decline after 145 calendar days. Reversals in the Value Line Geometric Index also qualify. Bull and bear markets are measured at peak and trough dates, so both the time and price criteria must be met as of the peak and trough dates.\n\n*****\n\n# More Volatility Likely During June Options Expiration Week and Beyond\n\n&gt; The second Triple Witching Week (Quadruple Witching if you prefer) of the year brings on some volatile trading with losses frequently exceeding gains. NASDAQ has the weakest record on the first trading day of the week. Triple-Witching Friday is usually better, DJIA has been up ten of the last seventeen years.\n\n&gt; Full-week performance is choppy as well, littered with greater than 1% moves in both directions. The week after Triple-Witching Day is horrendous. This week has experienced DJIA losses in 26 of the last 30 years with an average decline of 1.07%.

        "selftext": "In The Big Short (2015), Mark Baum and his crew [checked what the people they were betting against knew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCx5Ph7EAxg). It turned out that the people they were betting against knew nothing about the impending housing crash: \"business is good, profits are strong, and the mortgage continues to be the bedrock of the economy\". What Front Point Partners knew was still a secret.\n\nOn the other hand, the doomers in this sub kept repeating the same arguments over and over again: second wave, huge unemployment, etc. That **wasn't a big secret** to anyone. People with money to move markets knew that, and rightfully shrugged it off. I know it's become a meme here, but that's what priced in means.\n\nUnless you know something most people haven't figure out yet, you're not going to beat the market. In high frequency trading, this advantage is done by getting relatively simple information faster than everyone else - rule of thumb, if it's on the news already, it's been arbitraged away. In longer term investing, this is done through predictive models. The medium frequency traders find ways to predict probabilities of momentum and reversal to mean, and the low frequency traders, also known as investors, will model the future cashflows of the business based on macro, industry, and other types of information.\n\nFinally, when you think the market is irrational, just remember that means you're saying you're smarter than almost everyone else in the markets. The likelihood of that for the average Reddit user: 0%. So either, [be faster, smarter, but don't cheat](https://youtu.be/Hhy7JUinlu0?t=381).",

        "selftext": "Occasionally people ask how these loans work. Here's how. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe basics are the same everywhere but I'm doing this from a Canadian perspective which means I'm ignoring the US SEC Regulation T, special memorandum account, overnight maintenance requirement, initial margin, and pattern day trading rule, because all of those are concepts that have no equivalent or application in Canada. I'm also ignoring U.S. risk-based portfolio margin because we also don't have that in Canada, besides, in that case the calculations are based off of a commodity futures risk-based methdology, not rules-based traditional margin. But the basics are the same. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMargin in Canada hasn't really changed since the 1920's, except you have to put up at least 30% nowadays instead of 10% back before the crash of 1929.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Canada you can borrow up to 70% of a position at once for most stocks.  In Canada, the government doesn't regulate margin. The banks do that job themselves, so it hasn't changed much in 100 years. Only difference is that you had to have a lot of money to do it 25 years ago and so far as I know, today banks in Canada will let you open margin accounts without minimums, at least BMO which I am with does.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis means that if you want to buy $10,000 worth of RBC or Apple, you only have to put up $3,000 and your broker lends you the rest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMargin was invented by the Dutch who basically invented the modern financial system in the 1600s. Eventually the British took it over and ran with it, exporting that system to the 13 colonies. After they defeated Napoleon and went on to build the British Empire they exported that system to Canada and Australia for example. But it's really the Dutch who started it all around the time of Vermeer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe concept is that the bank will lend against some of your stock, but not all of it. They want a \"haircut.\" The haircut is the amount they won't lend against. In Canada the haircut is usually 30% but can be 50% and there are some stocks the banks won't lend against at all, like most of the stuff on the TSX-V or on the U.S. pink sheets. Every bank is different, so BMO InvestorLine might lend 50% on one small cap and TD Direct Investing 30% or vice versa for another. But most things are 30%, some are 50% and some are 100% (meaning no loan).   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe leverage is 1/haircut.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo say you have $3,000 and you want to buy on margin. As the bank haircut (margin rate) is 30%, you can buy $3,000/0.3 = $10,000 worth of stock. Obviously you then have a loan of $7,000. You now have $10,000 worth of stock, but remember, the bank won't let you borrow against 30%\\*$10,000 = $3,000. So your collateral is only $7,000. So you now have a $7,000 loan collateralized by $7,000 worth of stock. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the above example, you put up 30% margin, the same as the haircut. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's easy to see that if your total position slides so much as a dollar, you will have less collateral than $7,000 and therefore get what's called a margin call where the bank if it's BMO literally calls you on your cell and they tell you that you have to put up more money in a few hours or sell stock(which automatically pays down the loan to the extent of the sale) so that you have enough collateral to cover your loan, otherwise they wil automatically sell a stock of their choosing at an amount of their choosing. They are also allowed to sell whichever stock they choose automatically without calling you first, in the event of a margin call. That is explicitly set out in your margin agreement.  So obviously you need some \"buffer\" because of volatility, but how much do you borrow?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow you have to understand some math. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntarget margin = 1-(1-x)\\*(1-haircut)\n\nx is the price drawdown\n\ntarget margin is how much margin you have to put up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSay Apple is marginable at 30% (the haircut) by your bank. You decide you want to borrow on margin. But you decide, \"I will allow Apple to slide 40% from what I buy it at before I get a margin call.\" So how much margin should you put up?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntarget margin = 1-(1-0.4)\\*(1-0.3) = 1-0.6\\*0.7 = 1-0.42 = 0.58.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo you have to put up 58% margin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat means if you have $3,000 to invest, you would buy $3,000/0.58 = $5,172 worth of Apple. If Apple is trading at $350 that means it can slide to $210 before you get a margin call. At which point you will have lost 0.4/0.58 = 68.9% of your money. (Remember, leverage is simply 1/margin.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe formula above is simply a rearrangement using basic algebra, of the basic margin equation which is:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**price at margin call = initial price of stock\\*(1-target margin)/(1-haircut)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this is a handy reference.",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 15th, 2020.\n\n# **After big sell-off, stock market will be wary of virus and Fed testimony in week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/12/after-big-sell-off-stock-market-will-be-wary-of-virus-and-fed-testimony-in-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to reassure markets next week the central bank will do whatever it takes to help the economy heal. That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks could be caught in a tug-of-war in the week ahead, as investors weigh the potential positives of a reopening economy against worry that the coronavirus continues to spread. \n*****\n&gt; In the past week, the S&amp;P 500\u2032s sharp gains briefly drove the index into positive territory for the year, before a bruising sell-off at the end of the week. Stocks were more than 47% above the March 23 low before investors got spooked by signs the coronavirus is picking up in some areas. \n*****\n&gt; The Fed also dampened sentiment when it released economic forecasts Wednesday that showed a slow recovery and interest rates at zero through the end of 2022. Investors will hear more of the same when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks before Congress this Tuesday and Wednesday in his semi-annual economic testimony. He may provide more clarity on the Fed\u2019s bond buying and other policy moves.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales for May are released Tuesday, and that will be an important look at consumer spending activity. It is the most important data in the coming week, other than the weekly jobless claims report on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks rose on Friday with the S&amp;P 500 up more than 1% after Thursday\u2019s sharp sell-off that sent the index down nearly 6%. Treasury yields, which move opposite price, also moved sharply lower as investors moved to the safety of bonds. The 10-year yield was back to 0.70%,  well off the high of 0.95% in the week earlier.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve been overbought for awhile and digesting gains would be natural,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said the fact that 97% of the S&amp;P 500 companies\u2019 stocks were above their 50-day moving average this past week was a warning. The 50-day moving average is a momentum indicator, and if a stock or index rises above it, it is usually a positive, but if they all do, it\u2019s a contrarian warning.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cHistorically that\u2019s just too high ... and also the P/E on the S&amp;P was 25.1 of forward 12-months earnings, which is a 52% premium to the P/E average since 2000,\u201d he said. The P/E, or the price-to-earnings ratio, is an important tool to value stocks, and it averages around 16.5 times.\n*****\n&gt; In the sell-off, stocks that would benefit from the economy\u2019s reopening were the hardest hit. Investors had been jumping into those names, driving them higher at a dizzying pace. They were also the sectors that were last to join the rally, like banks, casinos, airlines and hotels.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOnce the pullback runs its course I think investors will move back again into the sectors and subsectors that were most beaten up in the bear market,\u201d said Stovall.  \n*****\n&gt; Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com, said he lightened up his holdings earlier in the week. \u201cThere were some clues early in the week that the market was vulnerable, like when the S&amp;P closed below 3,191 on Tuesday. You had some feverish trading in some of the very speculative names,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said other headwinds hang over the market, and one big one is the upcoming presidential election, which could become a bigger influence on the market. RealClearPolitics has President Donald Trump trailing former Vice President Joseph Biden by 8.1 points in the latest average of polls.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cTrump\u2019s numbers are just looking so bad, and if the Fed needs to keep interest rates at zero and we have the potential for a resurgence in Covid cases, then Trump is not going to benefit from an economic recovery, and as a result, that gives Biden a better chance of being elected,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily that the market dislikes Biden, but they dislike uncertainty. And a decline in equity prices would be representative of that uncertainty.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Consumer barometer\n&gt; Retail sales are typically a barometer for consumer spending, and when Americans were shut in their homes they did much less shopping than usual. April data showed a 16.7% drop in sales, but consumers did spend online.\n*****\n&gt; Economists are watching Tuesday\u2019s report on May sales closely, particularly after the May jobs report had a large upside surprise. There were 2.5 million jobs added in May, instead of an expected loss of 8.3 million.\n*****\n&gt; Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, said business-to-business spending data for May implies that retail sales were flat compared with April\u2019s depressed level and could be down 22% from a year ago.\n*****\n&gt; Zandi used data from Cortera, which collects information on about $1.5 trillion in business-to-business spending. In an analysis of spending by retailers in May, it found there were gains from April in some categories, including furniture, gasoline stations and restaurants.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cClothing and sporting goods store sales have been crushed, and that continued in May.  Restaurants,  gasoline stations and furniture stores have been hit hard, but showed strong improvement in May. Food and health and personal care stores have done well through the crisis, but gave some of that back in May,\u201d notes Zandi. \u201cOnline retailers, general merchandise stores (which includes WalMart and Target), and building material and garden supply stores (Home Depot and Lowes) have navigated the crisis well, and May was another solid month.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Zandi said weakness in apparel and sporting goods washed out the gains in other areas.\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead \n&gt; Strategists said Powell did not surprise the market with his comments this past week, but his sober approach reminded investors that the Fed policy will have to be in place for a very long time to pull the economy out of its deep rut. That will keep markets on high alert during his two days of testimony.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the cat\u2019s out of the bag. I don\u2019t think he can sugarcoat it. The thing he\u2019s got to worry about is he needs help. He needs Congress and the administration to come up with another fiscal rescue package. He can\u2019t do it on his own,\u201d said Zandi. \u201cHe has to keep the pressure on them and get a piece of legislation before they go on August recess.  ... He\u2019s speaking as much to the American people as he is to the policy makers.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Zandi said the Fed has acted aggressively and swiftly to unfreeze credit markets when they locked up in March, but the economy needs more stimulus ahead of a wave of potential business defaults and with a high level of unemployment. The Fed\u2019s balance sheet has ballooned to $7.2 trillion, and on Wednesday the central bank committed to monthly purchases of $80 billion in Treasury securities and $40 billion in mortgage securities.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think he continues to lay the foundation for policy changes to come,\u201d  said Zandi. \u201cHe\u2019s strongly suggesting there\u2019s going to be more monetary support, and that would come in the form of a few things - it would be performance dependent forward guidance. ... He\u2019s going to make it clear until the economy is at full employment and inflation is at least at target, if not above.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Zandi said Powell may discuss yield curve controls, which would mean the Fed would set targets for interest rate levels in the Treasury market, and make purchases to influence rates. Some economists believe the Fed  will adopt that tool before the end of the year.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think he\u2019s going to more clearly define the amount of QE they\u2019re doing going forward. He\u2019ll try to preserve some optionality, but he\u2019ll try to make it known, they\u2019re buying a lot of bonds for a long time to come,\u201d Zandi said.\n*****\n&gt; But the hearings could be more politicized, and Powell may be criticized by Congress for helping financial markets more than Main Street, said John Briggs, head of strategy at NatWest Markets. \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if there\u2019s a lot new, given it comes on the heels of the FOMC meeting,\u201d Briggs said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/pw0CUi2.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/fP1CK0o.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/UO6j0gC.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/GImgVgH.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JYCJeEm.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qcLni34.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/iC1YmSV.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qsph2Sm.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vM5brmK.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/LscP3vHv/ipos12.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/1Y2bHjI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/hrsZdEH.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Is This The Start Of A New Bear Market?\n\n&gt; \u201cStocks take an escalator up, but an elevator down.\u201d \u2014 Old investment axiom\n\n&gt; The saying above sure happened yesterday. In the end, the S&amp;P 500 Index fell 5.9% for the worst day since March 16 and the first three-day losing streak in more than three months. What does it mean? We\u2019ve been on record that we expect some type of well-deserved pullback or at least consolidation after the 45% bounce off of the March 23 lows and the best 50-day rally ever. Then add in the fact that June has been the worst month of the year for stocks since 2000 and some type of weakness is perfectly logical here and now.\n\n&gt; \u201cIn many ways, this is one of the most overbought stock markets we\u2019ve ever seen. Now the catch to this is previous times we\u2019ve seen major levels similar to now have been closer to the beginning of bull markets than the end of bull markets,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; This is now one of the greatest surges off a major low ever. It is perfectly normal to see a drawdown of double digits after the initial surge weakens. This could be happening now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We\u2019ve shown that huge up months like April tend to eventually resolve higher, but some near-term weakness is possible.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Also, when more than 90% of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are above their 50-day moving average, this shows solid longer-term results. Again, suggesting that very overbought isn\u2019t always a bad thing.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; There was a huge spike in stocks marking new monthly highs, again historically an overbought signal. This opens the door for some near-term weakness, but is a very positive sign longer-term.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Last, in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 was recently more than 13% above the 50-day moving average, one of the highest levels ever. The good news is one-year later stocks were higher every single time. Yet another clue that historically overbought isn\u2019t always a bad thing for the bulls.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; A record run, over-the-top excitement from small traders, the Nasdaq at 10,000, historically high multiples, and seasonality all could be a factor in why a pullback here could be perfectly normal. In fact, if you are bullish, after a 45% rally, one of the best things would be for prices to reset some here over the coming months. We would be a buyer of weakness and use it as an opportunity for longer-term price appreciation.\n\n*****\n\n# Persistent Volatility Runs Into Resistance &amp; Exuberant Sentiment\n\n&gt; We have all been gobsmacked by velocity and strength of this V-shaped rally off the March 23 bear market low. For the record this rally became an official Ned Davis Research defined bull market on May 26 when DJIA was up 30% from the low when it made a new recovery high after 50 calendar days (see NDR definitions below). And this was on the back of the shortest bear market on record, which lasted only 40 days. Today\u2019s market comeuppance is an important reminder that we need to be patient with this market and heed our cautious analysis and stance.\n\n&gt; This is still the \u201cWorst Six Months\u201d and as we warned in the May Outlook when the market is down during the \u201cBest Six Months\u201d (November-April) as they were in 2020, the \u201cWorst Six Months\u201d (May-October) were down or flat 86% of the time with a median S&amp;P decline of -6.7% since 1950.\n\n&gt; Other seasonal indicators are also flashing the caution sign. This year\u2019s negative January Barometer and breached December DJIA low, point to possible retests of the lows and choppy, volatile trading over the next several months. See the updated composite graph of the seasonal pattern for these 22 years since 1950 in the June Outlook.\n\n&gt; It appears that quite a fair amount of hope was built into the rally. Lots of hope that everything is just going back to the way it was real soon. But COVID cases are on the climb again and folks are concerned that a pause and/or reverse of reopening could delay the economic recovery and derail the bull. Up until the past few days it felt like mid-February again with the market ignoring economic and corporate data as momentum pushed everything higher.\n\n&gt; The jobs report was a bit unbelievable and then Fed Chairman Powell\u2019s candor and reserved outlook at yesterday\u2019s press conference put the fear right back into the market today. Meanwhile the Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDPNow model currently estimates that 2020 Q2 GDP growth will be down -48.5%.\n\n&gt; Sentiment had also become rather exuberant as the Weekly CBOE Equity Only Put/Call ratio we track in the \u201cPulse of the Market\u201d hit 0.43 last week \u2013 its lowest level since the week ending 4/10/2010 about three weeks before the infamous flash crash. Investor\u2019s Intelligence Advisors Sentiment survey Bullish advisors are now up to 56.9%. Correction advisors are down to 22.5% while Bearish advisors have slipped further to 20.6%, putting us at caution levels.\n\n&gt; Technically, things deteriorated rapidly today. After blasting through several levels of resistance we have been tracking as shown in the chart here S&amp;P 500 stalled at 3210 and plunged 5.9% today through 3115 support/resistance and closed just below 3010 support/resistance which sits at the 2019 summer highs. The next major support level below here is 2725 right near where the 50-day moving average turned up in mid-May, which would be a 15.7% correction from the recent recovery high reached this past Monday, June 8.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7d877af1643a7342c0c8622cbc763c92/eb566818257f08b5-2b/s500x750/8228cad8989a5456266c3f0d753168c4d3c3efec.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Ned Davis Research bull and bear market definitions:\n\n&gt; A cyclical bull market requires a 30% rise in the DJIA after 50 calendar days or a 13% rise after 155 calendar days. Reversals of 30% in the Value Line Geometric Index since 1965 also qualify. A cyclical bear market requires a 30% drop in the DJIA after 50 calendar days or a 13% decline after 145 calendar days. Reversals in the Value Line Geometric Index also qualify. Bull and bear markets are measured at peak and trough dates, so both the time and price criteria must be met as of the peak and trough dates.\n\n*****\n\n# More Volatility Likely During June Options Expiration Week and Beyond\n\n&gt; The second Triple Witching Week (Quadruple Witching if you prefer) of the year brings on some volatile trading with losses frequently exceeding gains. NASDAQ has the weakest record on the first trading day of the week. Triple-Witching Friday is usually better, DJIA has been up ten of the last seventeen years.\n\n&gt; Full-week performance is choppy as well, littered with greater than 1% moves in both directions. The week after Triple-Witching Day is horrendous. This week has experienced DJIA losses in 26 of the last 30 years with an average decline of 1.07%. S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have fared slightly better during the week after over the same 30-year span, declining 0.72% and 0.23% respectively on average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cbdc17aecf40cbf412100049a35e7f1b/4c6fa6c95e723529-93/s500x750/0bd7385e1b398b3c223892fe86cd1886d41bc9fd.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8de0bdcd706b729d7e5ebe8fd92670b9/4c6fa6c95e723529-e7/s500x750/fa1a12f3de57328b97c1f4f5a274d24e94fd19de.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/09c9ca9d3a0502b4a8d97976bd73366e/4c6fa6c95e723529-cf/s500x750/498b4d398dde04ebb764b72d962aa53378b29260.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$KR** \n&gt; * **$MFA** \n&gt; * **$GRPN** \n&gt; * **$JKS** \n&gt; * **$ORCL** \n&gt; * **$LEN** \n&gt; * **$KMX** \n&gt; * **$TSQ** \n&gt; * **$HRB** \n&gt; * **$MPAA** \n&gt; * **$SWBI** \n&gt; * **$CMC** \n&gt; * **$RGS** \n&gt; * **$TTM** \n&gt; * **$HOME** \n&gt; * **$JBL** \n&gt; * **$DBI** \n&gt; * **$AMSWA** \n&gt; * **$ABM** \n&gt; * **$BNGO** \n&gt; * **$CNTG** \n&gt; * **$LMB** \n&gt; * **$LIVX** \n&gt; * **$ALYA** \n&gt; * **$GAN** \n&gt; * **$INWK** \n&gt; * **$VOLT** \n&gt; * **$UROV** \n&gt; * **$VNCE**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/vM5brmK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/l3jztzJ.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.15.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/shKM8RG.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.16.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PYffarr.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0uE8QeB.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/bNd3sxx.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HdpyR9B.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.18.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DNsufe6.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.19.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FHBG6yj.png))\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.19.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Kroger Co. $32.26\n&gt; **Kroger Co.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 15th, 2020.\n\n# **After big sell-off, stock market will be wary of virus and Fed testimony in week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/12/after-big-sell-off-stock-market-will-be-wary-of-virus-and-fed-testimony-in-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to reassure markets next week the central bank will do whatever it takes to help the economy heal. That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks could be caught in a tug-of-war in the week ahead, as investors weigh the potential positives of a reopening economy against worry that the coronavirus continues to spread. \n*****\n&gt; In the past week, the S&amp;P 500\u2032s sharp gains briefly drove the index into positive territory for the year, before a bruising sell-off at the end of the week. Stocks were more than 47% above the March 23 low before investors got spooked by signs the coronavirus is picking up in some areas. \n*****\n&gt; The Fed also dampened sentiment when it released economic forecasts Wednesday that showed a slow recovery and interest rates at zero through the end of 2022. Investors will hear more of the same when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks before Congress this Tuesday and Wednesday in his semi-annual economic testimony. He may provide more clarity on the Fed\u2019s bond buying and other policy moves.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales for May are released Tuesday, and that will be an important look at consumer spending activity. It is the most important data in the coming week, other than the weekly jobless claims report on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks rose on Friday with the S&amp;P 500 up more than 1% after Thursday\u2019s sharp sell-off that sent the index down nearly 6%. Treasury yields, which move opposite price, also moved sharply lower as investors moved to the safety of bonds. The 10-year yield was back to 0.70%,  well off the high of 0.95% in the week earlier.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve been overbought for awhile and digesting gains would be natural,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said the fact that 97% of the S&amp;P 500 companies\u2019 stocks were above their 50-day moving average this past week was a warning. The 50-day moving average is a momentum indicator, and if a stock or index rises above it, it is usually a positive, but if they all do, it\u2019s a contrarian warning.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cHistorically that\u2019s just too high ... and also the P/E on the S&amp;P was 25.1 of forward 12-months earnings, which is a 52% premium to the P/E average since 2000,\u201d he said. The P/E, or the price-to-earnings ratio, is an important tool to value stocks, and it averages around 16.5 times.\n*****\n&gt; In the sell-off, stocks that would benefit from the economy\u2019s reopening were the hardest hit. Investors had been jumping into those names, driving them higher at a dizzying pace. They were also the sectors that were last to join the rally, like banks, casinos, airlines and hotels.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOnce the pullback runs its course I think investors will move back again into the sectors and subsectors that were most beaten up in the bear market,\u201d said Stovall.  \n*****\n&gt; Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com, said he lightened up his holdings earlier in the week. \u201cThere were some clues early in the week that the market was vulnerable, like when the S&amp;P closed below 3,191 on Tuesday. You had some feverish trading in some of the very speculative names,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said other headwinds hang over the market, and one big one is the upcoming presidential election, which could become a bigger influence on the market. RealClearPolitics has President Donald Trump trailing former Vice President Joseph Biden by 8.1 points in the latest average of polls.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cTrump\u2019s numbers are just looking so bad, and if the Fed needs to keep interest rates at zero and we have the potential for a resurgence in Covid cases, then Trump is not going to benefit from an economic recovery, and as a result, that gives Biden a better chance of being elected,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily that the market dislikes Biden, but they dislike uncertainty. And a decline in equity prices would be representative of that uncertainty.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Consumer barometer\n&gt; Retail sales are typically a barometer for consumer spending, and when Americans were shut in their homes they did much less shopping than usual. April data showed a 16.7% drop in sales, but consumers did spend online.\n*****\n&gt; Economists are watching Tuesday\u2019s report on May sales closely, particularly after the May jobs report had a large upside surprise. There were 2.5 million jobs added in May, instead of an expected loss of 8.3 million.\n*****\n&gt; Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, said business-to-business spending data for May implies that retail sales were flat compared with April\u2019s depressed level and could be down 22% from a year ago.\n*****\n&gt; Zandi used data from Cortera, which collects information on about $1.5 trillion in business-to-business spending. In an analysis of spending by retailers in May, it found there were gains from April in some categories, including furniture, gasoline stations and restaurants.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cClothing and sporting goods store sales have been crushed, and that continued in May.  Restaurants,  gasoline stations and furniture stores have been hit hard, but showed strong improvement in May. Food and health and personal care stores have done well through the crisis, but gave some of that back in May,\u201d notes Zandi. \u201cOnline retailers, general merchandise stores (which includes WalMart and Target), and building material and garden supply stores (Home Depot and Lowes) have navigated the crisis well, and May was another solid month.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Zandi said weakness in apparel and sporting goods washed out the gains in other areas.\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead \n&gt; Strategists said Powell did not surprise the market with his comments this past week, but his sober approach reminded investors that the Fed policy will have to be in place for a very long time to pull the economy out of its deep rut. That will keep markets on high alert during his two days of testimony.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the cat\u2019s out of the bag. I don\u2019t think he can sugarcoat it. The thing he\u2019s got to worry about is he needs help. He needs Congress and the administration to come up with another fiscal rescue package. He can\u2019t do it on his own,\u201d said Zandi. \u201cHe has to keep the pressure on them and get a piece of legislation before they go on August recess.  ... He\u2019s speaking as much to the American people as he is to the policy makers.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Zandi said the Fed has acted aggressively and swiftly to unfreeze credit markets when they locked up in March, but the economy needs more stimulus ahead of a wave of potential business defaults and with a high level of unemployment. The Fed\u2019s balance sheet has ballooned to $7.2 trillion, and on Wednesday the central bank committed to monthly purchases of $80 billion in Treasury securities and $40 billion in mortgage securities.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think he continues to lay the foundation for policy changes to come,\u201d  said Zandi. \u201cHe\u2019s strongly suggesting there\u2019s going to be more monetary support, and that would come in the form of a few things - it would be performance dependent forward guidance. ... He\u2019s going to make it clear until the economy is at full employment and inflation is at least at target, if not above.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Zandi said Powell may discuss yield curve controls, which would mean the Fed would set targets for interest rate levels in the Treasury market, and make purchases to influence rates. Some economists believe the Fed  will adopt that tool before the end of the year.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think he\u2019s going to more clearly define the amount of QE they\u2019re doing going forward. He\u2019ll try to preserve some optionality, but he\u2019ll try to make it known, they\u2019re buying a lot of bonds for a long time to come,\u201d Zandi said.\n*****\n&gt; But the hearings could be more politicized, and Powell may be criticized by Congress for helping financial markets more than Main Street, said John Briggs, head of strategy at NatWest Markets. \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if there\u2019s a lot new, given it comes on the heels of the FOMC meeting,\u201d Briggs said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/pw0CUi2.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/fP1CK0o.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/UO6j0gC.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/GImgVgH.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JYCJeEm.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qcLni34.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/iC1YmSV.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qsph2Sm.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vM5brmK.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/LscP3vHv/ipos12.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/1Y2bHjI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/hrsZdEH.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Is This The Start Of A New Bear Market?\n\n&gt; \u201cStocks take an escalator up, but an elevator down.\u201d \u2014 Old investment axiom\n\n&gt; The saying above sure happened yesterday. In the end, the S&amp;P 500 Index fell 5.9% for the worst day since March 16 and the first three-day losing streak in more than three months. What does it mean? We\u2019ve been on record that we expect some type of well-deserved pullback or at least consolidation after the 45% bounce off of the March 23 lows and the best 50-day rally ever. Then add in the fact that June has been the worst month of the year for stocks since 2000 and some type of weakness is perfectly logical here and now.\n\n&gt; \u201cIn many ways, this is one of the most overbought stock markets we\u2019ve ever seen. Now the catch to this is previous times we\u2019ve seen major levels similar to now have been closer to the beginning of bull markets than the end of bull markets,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; This is now one of the greatest surges off a major low ever. It is perfectly normal to see a drawdown of double digits after the initial surge weakens. This could be happening now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We\u2019ve shown that huge up months like April tend to eventually resolve higher, but some near-term weakness is possible.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Also, when more than 90% of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are above their 50-day moving average, this shows solid longer-term results. Again, suggesting that very overbought isn\u2019t always a bad thing.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; There was a huge spike in stocks marking new monthly highs, again historically an overbought signal. This opens the door for some near-term weakness, but is a very positive sign longer-term.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Last, in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 was recently more than 13% above the 50-day moving average, one of the highest levels ever. The good news is one-year later stocks were higher every single time. Yet another clue that historically overbought isn\u2019t always a bad thing for the bulls.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.12.20-blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; A record run, over-the-top excitement from small traders, the Nasdaq at 10,000, historically high multiples, and seasonality all could be a factor in why a pullback here could be perfectly normal. In fact, if you are bullish, after a 45% rally, one of the best things would be for prices to reset some here over the coming months. We would be a buyer of weakness and use it as an opportunity for longer-term price appreciation.\n\n*****\n\n# Persistent Volatility Runs Into Resistance &amp; Exuberant Sentiment\n\n&gt; We have all been gobsmacked by velocity and strength of this V-shaped rally off the March 23 bear market low. For the record this rally became an official Ned Davis Research defined bull market on May 26 when DJIA was up 30% from the low when it made a new recovery high after 50 calendar days (see NDR definitions below). And this was on the back of the shortest bear market on record, which lasted only 40 days. Today\u2019s market comeuppance is an important reminder that we need to be patient with this market and heed our cautious analysis and stance.\n\n&gt; This is still the \u201cWorst Six Months\u201d and as we warned in the May Outlook when the market is down during the \u201cBest Six Months\u201d (November-April) as they were in 2020, the \u201cWorst Six Months\u201d (May-October) were down or flat 86% of the time with a median S&amp;P decline of -6.7% since 1950.\n\n&gt; Other seasonal indicators are also flashing the caution sign. This year\u2019s negative January Barometer and breached December DJIA low, point to possible retests of the lows and choppy, volatile trading over the next several months. See the updated composite graph of the seasonal pattern for these 22 years since 1950 in the June Outlook.\n\n&gt; It appears that quite a fair amount of hope was built into the rally. Lots of hope that everything is just going back to the way it was real soon. But COVID cases are on the climb again and folks are concerned that a pause and/or reverse of reopening could delay the economic recovery and derail the bull. Up until the past few days it felt like mid-February again with the market ignoring economic and corporate data as momentum pushed everything higher.\n\n&gt; The jobs report was a bit unbelievable and then Fed Chairman Powell\u2019s candor and reserved outlook at yesterday\u2019s press conference put the fear right back into the market today. Meanwhile the Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDPNow model currently estimates that 2020 Q2 GDP growth will be down -48.5%.\n\n&gt; Sentiment had also become rather exuberant as the Weekly CBOE Equity Only Put/Call ratio we track in the \u201cPulse of the Market\u201d hit 0.43 last week \u2013 its lowest level since the week ending 4/10/2010 about three weeks before the infamous flash crash. Investor\u2019s Intelligence Advisors Sentiment survey Bullish advisors are now up to 56.9%. Correction advisors are down to 22.5% while Bearish advisors have slipped further to 20.6%, putting us at caution levels.\n\n&gt; Technically, things deteriorated rapidly today. After blasting through several levels of resistance we have been tracking as shown in the chart here S&amp;P 500 stalled at 3210 and plunged 5.9% today through 3115 support/resistance and closed just below 3010 support/resistance which sits at the 2019 summer highs. The next major support level below here is 2725 right near where the 50-day moving average turned up in mid-May, which would be a 15.7% correction from the recent recovery high reached this past Monday, June 8.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7d877af1643a7342c0c8622cbc763c92/eb566818257f08b5-2b/s500x750/8228cad8989a5456266c3f0d753168c4d3c3efec.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Ned Davis Research bull and bear market definitions:\n\n&gt; A cyclical bull market requires a 30% rise in the DJIA after 50 calendar days or a 13% rise after 155 calendar days. Reversals of 30% in the Value Line Geometric Index since 1965 also qualify. A cyclical bear market requires a 30% drop in the DJIA after 50 calendar days or a 13% decline after 145 calendar days. Reversals in the Value Line Geometric Index also qualify. Bull and bear markets are measured at peak and trough dates, so both the time and price criteria must be met as of the peak and trough dates.\n\n*****\n\n# More Volatility Likely During June Options Expiration Week and Beyond\n\n&gt; The second Triple Witching Week (Quadruple Witching if you prefer) of the year brings on some volatile trading with losses frequently exceeding gains. NASDAQ has the weakest record on the first trading day of the week. Triple-Witching Friday is usually better, DJIA has been up ten of the last seventeen years.\n\n&gt; Full-week performance is choppy as well, littered with greater than 1% moves in both directions. The week after Triple-Witching Day is horrendous. This week has experienced DJIA losses in 26 of the last 30 years with an average decline of 1.07%. S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have fared slightly better during the week after over the same 30-year span, declining 0.72% and 0.23% respectively on average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cbdc17aecf40cbf412100049a35e7f1b/4c6fa6c95e723529-93/s500x750/0bd7385e1b398b3c223892fe86cd1886d41bc9fd.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8de0bdcd706b729d7e5ebe8fd92670b9/4c6fa6c95e723529-e7/s500x750/fa1a12f3de57328b97c1f4f5a274d24e94fd19de.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/09c9ca9d3a0502b4a8d97976bd73366e/4c6fa6c95e723529-cf/s500x750/498b4d398dde04ebb764b72d962aa53378b29260.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending June 12th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Vn8EIUmbU))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 6.14.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w2a_gQvLdg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$KR** \n&gt; * **$MFA** \n&gt; * **$GRPN** \n&gt; * **$JKS** \n&gt; * **$ORCL** \n&gt; * **$LEN** \n&gt; * **$KMX** \n&gt; * **$TSQ** \n&gt; * **$HRB** \n&gt; * **$MPAA** \n&gt; * **$SWBI** \n&gt; * **$CMC** \n&gt; * **$RGS** \n&gt; * **$TTM** \n&gt; * **$HOME** \n&gt; * **$JBL** \n&gt; * **$DBI** \n&gt; * **$AMSWA** \n&gt; * **$ABM** \n&gt; * **$BNGO** \n&gt; * **$CNTG** \n&gt; * **$LMB** \n&gt; * **$LIVX** \n&gt; * **$ALYA** \n&gt; * **$GAN** \n&gt; * **$INWK** \n&gt; * **$VOLT** \n&gt; * **$UROV** \n&gt; * **$VNCE**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/vM5brmK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/l3jztzJ.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.15.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/shKM8RG.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.16.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PYffarr.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0uE8QeB.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/bNd3sxx.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HdpyR9B.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.18.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DNsufe6.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.19.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FHBG6yj.png))\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.19.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Kroger Co. $32.26\n&gt; **Kroger Co.

Anyway, keep up the great work!\n\nI had also noticed the Belafonte lyrics accompanying the Izea countdown posts. u/oneofthephams post inspired me to dig a little deeper. \n\nI'll start by saying that this post is for entertainment purposes! Do not use this information as DD or a basis for making an investment decision. This was scraped together in a short period of time while hanging out this evening.\n\nInitially, I was hung up on the Belafonte lyrics on the Izea countdown. When I took a step back and shifted focus, I noticed their was a similar use of a countdown style post by both Izea and Trident. Also, the countdown images posted by Izea contain a silhouette in the shape of what looks awfully similar to the shape of the new Trident product announced in their countdown ad.\n\nInstagram: @tridentgum, countdown post for release of a new product which was referenced by Izea:\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CAOC4rgFEJu/?igshid=aan6mlsbi543\n\nInstagram: @izea, similar use of a countdown post as Trident (shape of silhouette behind number looks similar to the container used for the new release by Trident - sour berry twist. I know what you're thinking, \"that's the silhouette shape of the Izea logo\". Well, you'd be right. No need to poke a hole in a theory if it's been done for you lol. I still like the gum connection:\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CBQQKoblqGF/?igshid=a61e35lod3of\n\nWho owns Trident gum? Fortune 500 company Mondelez! Could they be the new Fortune 500 company that Izea plans to announce a partnership with?\n\nhttps://www.mondelezinternational.com/Our-Brands/Trident\n\nLet's get weird and go out on an even bigger stretch for the fun of it as reinforcement for this PURELY SPECULATIVE THEORY FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES... \n\nWhat's with the Harry Belafonte lyrics? Who knows. Maybe nothing. But the name...what's in a name? Here is mention of both Trident gum and Harry Belafonte on the same page of the November 4th, 1985 edition of New York Magazine:\n\nhttps://books.google.ca/books?id=7McBAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=harry+belafonte+trident+gum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0qmZ9jfA0N&amp;sig=ACfU3U3uvICUMLmDyROISeJnwmKAgA5Jtg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj8lP6Ys_jpAhWPHjQIHbpCB2gQ6AEwAHoECAQQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=harry%20belafonte%20trident%20gum&amp;f=false\n\nSo, Harry Belafonte was seemingly the talk of the town in 1985. What did he have going on that year you might ask? Well, he had a TV special called 'Harry Belafonte in concert' (perhaps he performed 'Jump in line', though I wasn't able to confirm). That's cool, but where's the connection you ask? Who else was popular during that period and happened to be a cast member on that TV special? None other than Bill Cosby! https://m.imdb.com/title/tt2706142/\n\nPrior to being convicted as a sex offender, Bill Cosby was a celebrity spokesperson for Kraft Foods and Jell-O for many years. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Cosby_in_advertising\n\nLet's focus less on Bill Cosby and more on Jell-O. In August of 2011, Kraft Foods announced plans to split into 2 publicly traded companies, an international snack-food company and a North American grocery company. The snack-food company, MONDELEZ INTERNATIONAL, would be the legal successor of Kraft Foods. The grocery company became a new company called Kraft Foods Group. The split was completed in August 2012. Kraft Foods Group would later merge with Heinz to become Kraft Heinz. One of the products in their portfolio is, you guessed it, Jell-O:\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Heinz\n\nAnother note of interest:\n\nMay 21, 2020\n\nKellogg\u2019s Rice Krispies identified by IZEA as 2020\u2019s \u201cMost Influential Cold Cereal Brand\u201d\n\nIZEA\u2019s BrandGraph\u00ae Platform Reveals the Cold Cereal Brand that Controls 26% of the Influencer Share of Voice for Content Volume:\n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/05/21/2036975/0/en/Kellogg-s-Rice-Krispies-identified-by-IZEA-as-2020-s-Most-Influential-Cold-Cereal-Brand.html\n\nWho is one of Kellogg's top rivals? That's right...Mondelez International. Another big player in the food sector who is also a Fortune 500 company? General Mills. \n\nPerhaps one of these companies saw value in a partnership to gain a strategic edge amongst their competitors. Based on the initial line of my ridiculous theory, my guess would be Mondelez.\n\nInteresting to note regarding Mondelez:\n\nCHICAGO, June 10, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mondel\u0113z International, Inc. (NASDAQ: MDLZ) announced that Glen Walter, Executive Vice President and President, North America, will present at the Evercore ISI Virtual Consumer &amp; Retail Summit, on June 16 at 8:00 a.m. ET.\n\nhttps://ir.mondelezinternational.com/news-releases/news-release-details/mondelez-international-present-evercore-isi-virtual-consumer\n\nThat's all for now! Hope you've had a good laugh. I sure did while trying to draw thin parallels from the cryptic social media posts by Izea. \n\nI'm fully prepared to receive negative comments on this post when the news comes out of the actual partner. If you get bent out of shape, you missed the point. This was for fun and wasn't based on any real evidence to suggest any of this is remotely close to being an educated guess.\n\nHowever, if I'm right? Well damn, I guess I'll continue to carry out this sort of bizarre investigative approach! Haha\n\nTake care!",

        "selftext": "Let's try to answer this question !\n\n**Who ?**\n\n\u00ab Wirecard is an international supplier of electronic payment and risk management services. Wirecard offers products and services in the areas of [mobile payments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_payment), [e-commerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce), [digitization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digitization) and finance technology. This traditionally comprises the integration of payment methods, payment transactions via e-commerce as well as payment transactions at the stationary checkout ([POS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_sale)). In these areas, Wirecard currently works in cooperation with 280,000 companies (as of December 2018), including [Allianz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allianz), [KLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KLM), [Qatar Airways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar_Airways),[Rakuten.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakuten.com) and [Transport for London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_for_London), among others. The transaction volume in 2018 was US$125 billion. In the first half of 2019 the transaction volume grew by 37.5 percent to EUR 77.3 billion. \u00bb Wikipedia \n\n**Shareholders ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rzpbs9z98q551.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e65866db19ca77189d307e4f61b528e538b7f374\n\n**Creditors :**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Deutsche Bank took half of Markus shares as a collateral for a loan of 150m \u20ac to Markus not Wirecard\n\n**Market share ?** \n\nThose are the countries using the most Wirecard :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wl1tg5xa8q551.png?width=416&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69082fc467534b0a127e1d42deefff048a4a9824\n\nMarket shares of the European competitors : \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fsz15v5c8q551.png?width=1994&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30d876934f7ee8734a3a58f2c219a05e95d9ba0c\n\n*Side note* : Amongst international competitors there arePaypal, Visa, Apple Pay \u2026\n\n**What happened ?**\n\nAll really begun with this 59 pages report written by KPMG ([https://www.wirecard.com/uploads/Bericht\\_Sonderpruefung\\_KPMG\\_EN\\_200501\\_Disclaimer.pdf](https://www.wirecard.com/uploads/Bericht_Sonderpruefung_KPMG_EN_200501_Disclaimer.pdf)) concerning a forensic special investigation on Wirecard, which basically mean that they are investigating about a **specific case** with the aim of fully clarifying a potential (not necessarily criminally relevant) violation or misconduct, so this is not a annual audit.\n\nIn this report, KPMG complained about the lack of will of Wirecard to give informations, KPMG was unable to obtain standard information that it requested from Wirecard such as bank statements, customer names and contracts as well as transaction data.\n\nThis document was the main reason of the Chris Hohn\u2019s open letter. The famous hedge fund manager published an open letter on April 28 to Thomas Eichelmann, the chairman of Wirecard ([https://www.tcifund.com/files/corporateengageement/wirecard/TCI%20-%20Letter%20to%20Wirecard%2028%20April%202020.pdf](https://www.tcifund.com/files/corporateengageement/wirecard/TCI%20-%20Letter%20to%20Wirecard%2028%20April%202020.pdf)).\n\nIn his letter, he states the audit made by KPMG was inconclusive, \u00ab KPMG explains that it has encountered an \u201cUntersuchungshemmnis\u201d (in English: obstacles to the investigation) \u00bb, basically, 1 billion $ was missing between 2016 and 2018. So it raises questions to how investors, lenders and regulators can be confident that Wirecard\u2019s current and historic accounting is accurate, so they wanted for Wirecard to show some trust by firing Markus the CEO, but today he is still here. He concluded by announcing that he was short selling 1.04% of shares outstanding of Wirecard.\n\n**Since then :** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* TILP filed an investor lawsuit. The lawsuit claims that the KPMG report showed that the group for years had experienced a massive shortfall in compliance\u009d that it had been obliged to disclose to shareholders early on. Why is it important ? Because this law firm has already won cases against Porsche and Volkswagen during the diesel gate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Al Alam a Dubai business payment processor their most significant business partner entered liquidation on May 2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Today the stock dropped 61% and their bonds by more than 40% because EY which was conducting an annual audit said that they were unable to confirm the existence of 2.1b $, and that \u00ab  spurious cash balance \u00bb have been provided to auditor by 3rd party. This missing fund represents 25% of the company. They have to come clean by tomorrow (June 18).\n\n**Conclusion :**\n\nConsidering the online payment business as fast very forward industry, Wirecard is facing two challenges :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* First, they will need to find a managerial equilibrium in a short time\n* Second, they will need earn back trust from current clients and future ones. They may loose more clients in the short term.\n\nThose challenges are actually very hard to tackle in an healthy market but in this one it seems nearly impossible, furthermore, big investors will be selling massively those next few days so we might see more loses.\n\n**I am not a financial advisor but I would say that in the long and short term the stock is going down as well as the company.**",

Perfect for daily commuters that don't have a long drive, and for those that want a cheaper than average electric vehicle.

        "selftext": "**Disclaimer:** I took a position in KBLM (warrants) today. This post is a summary of the DD I did beforehand.\n\n**About the SPAC:**\nName: KBL Merger Corp. IV\nIPO: June, 2017 - $100M\nLeadership team:\n* CEO: Marlene Krauss, M.D. *Previously CEO and Chairman of three KBL SPACs - KBL Healthcare I, II, and III., B.A. Cornell University, M.D. Harvard Medical School, M.B.A. Harvard Business School (Alumni Achievement Award; Dean's Committee).*\n* Chairman: George Hornig. *CEO of RON Transatlantic Financial Holdings, Former COO of Pine Bridge Investments, Credit Suisse Asset Management and Deutsche Bank (Americas), A.B., M.B.A., and J.D. Harvard University.*\n* COO: Joseph A. Williamson *Managing Partner at JAW Capital, Chairman of National Home Care Holdings, Previously co-founder and President of Concord Health Group acquired by KBL Acquisition I and subsequently sold to MultiCare.*\n* The team also has [four scientific advisors with impressive backgrounds](https://kblmerger.com/our-team). This is the first healthcare/biotech SPAC I've invested in, so I'm not sure whether this is normal, but it impressed me that they have just as many scientific advisors as they do directors.\n\n[Here is a video about Dr. Krauss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OWCcnN0J-s) from Harvard Business School's YouTube channel. My takeaway was that she's been a lifelong overachiever in school and in business, knows the healthcare industry/investments inside and out, and comes across as a very geniune person.\n\n**About the target:**\n[CannBioRx](https://cannbiorx.com)\n\nOfficers and Directors:\n* Co-Chairman: [Prof Sir Marc Feldmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Feldmann). His wikipedia says it all.\n* Co-Chairman: [Prof Lawrence Steinman](http://med.stanford.edu/steinmanlab/lawrence_steinman.html) *Professor of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Pediatrics, and Genetics.  He also served as the Chair of the Stanford University Interdepartmental Program in Immunology from 2003-2011.*\n* CEO and CSO: Dr Jonathan Rothbard. [Here is a podcast interview he did last month](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LylpAGuSuHI). Funny story @9:15 when he starts talking about his background.\n\nThere are three CannBioRx group companies:\n**[Katexco Pharmaceuticals](https://cannbiorx.com/katexco/)** - *A second-generation pharmaceutical cannabis company targeting autoimmune diseases by a variety of approaches, including utilizing CBD or related compounds, or CB2 agonists. The company will be targeting multi-billion-dollar markets of multiple sclerosis, gastrointestinal disorders, gout, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and atherosclerosis.* This one sounds the most promising of the three to me. I also found this quote from an [interview with Dr. Rothbard about Katexco](https://thriveglobal.com/stories/the-future-of-healthcare-a-second-generation-of-fda-approved-medical-cannabis-with-dr-jonathan-rothbard/): *\"Katexco is developing cannabis-derived treatments through clinical trials that will eventually be submitted to the FDA, including the world\u2019s first drug to exploit a key receptor on immune cells in the brain with the ability to treat inflammatory diseases like Crohn\u2019s disease, gout and multiple sclerosis\"*\n**[CannBioRex](https://cannbiorx.com/cannbiorex/)** - *pioneer in the field of synthetic non-psychoactive cannabinoids, and the result of a twenty-year collaboration between Professor Sir Marc Feldmann and Professor Raphael Mechoulam, who is a leading expert in cannabis chemistry and successfully identified THC, CBD, and endocannabinoids.* This sentence in particular jumped out at me: *Despite roughly 3,000 pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies existing globally, there are only a handful of companies actively developing synthetic cannabinoids for human and veterinary health.* Like Katexco, this also sounds very promising. The name choice is confusing... it's identical to the parent company except for the 'e' in the name.\n**[180 Theraputics](https://cannbiorx.com/therapeutics/)** - I'll save you the summary, this one does not sound very promising. They have one project targeting treating early-stage fibrosis of the hand. They also have **plans** for a trial to treat frozen shoulder, which affects up to 2% of the population. That's it.\n\n**My cons:**\n* It's been 3 years since the KBLM IPO was completed, and 11 months since they announced their target. We're obviously getting down to crunch time here.\n* The cannabis industry as a whole is still toxic to investors right now. I think a lot of people see Cannabis in a press release and immediately move on these days.\n\n**My pros:**\n* The leadership team of both the SPAC and target seem excellent. Very long track records.\n* Even though I listed the fact that the SPAC is in crunch time as a con, it's my opinion that these warrants are severely undervalued. There is \n* [They sweetened the pot on March 24th](https://spacinsider.com/2020/03/24/kblm-offering-very-attractive-extension-contribution/). The COVID lockdowns were only a week or two old at the time and the market was tanking (like I need to tell you guys). Perhaps they were ready to move forward with a vote but chose to delay until July thinking the business climate would improve / things would be somewhat back to normal. This might just be wishful thinking on my part, but why bother sweetening the pot for non-redeemers if they felt the deal was on thin ice?\n* Their vote is scheduled for July 9th. I don't like holding warrants forever!\n\nI'd like to hear everyone's thoughts on this one. When I posted about it in the weekly thread this morning I was surprised how many people are holding it... I had yet to see KBLM talked about here.",

        "selftext": "I am posting my portfolio and strategies here to gain insight and hopefully learn from those that are much smarter than I am. Please be critical and constructive! \n\nI have decided to split my cash into two portfolios: core holdings and secondary portfolio which has a worth of 50% of my core holdings portfolio (150% total).\n\nThese are my targets for my core holdings portfolio:\n\n|Canadian Utilities (CU)|10.53%|\n|:-|:-|\n|Enbridge (ENB)|10.53%|\n|TD Bank (TD)|13.16%|\n|Canada West Bank (CWB)|13.16%|\n|Northwest Healthcare Properties REIT (NWH)|10.53%|\n|Riocan (REI)|21.05%|\n|Telus (T)|10.53%|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The reason I am drawn to these companies:\n   * I wanted to set up a dividend portfolio in my TFSA and reinvest dividends via DRIPs. These companies had high yields back in March when the pandemic hit and I saw an opportunity to lock in high yields with big, relatively safe Canadian companies that are an integral part of our economy. \n   * Other companies that I considered and may go back to:\n      * Financials: CIX, because it dropped harder than the banks and looking at the charts, I am expecting a breakout soon. I also considered all the other 5 big banks but went with TD due to their exposure to the US market. \n      * REITs: BPY, HR-UN. I am desperate to save enough money to open a DRIP with HR REIT. I believe they are undervalued according to their balance sheets and I did pick up a few shares at $8.20 and wish I had more cash to pour into it at that time. \n      * Communications: RCI, BCE, but decided on Telus due to their EMR market share. Also having first hand experience - their EMR is extremely user friendly and maintenance and administration is cheaper and easier than OSCAR based systems. This is especially true for rural communities with an aging population since all those patients still carry flip phones and most just rely on their landline. Using Facetime or smartphone based tech makes them uncomfortable. Seeing the system in action during this lockdown, especially how well it works with a work from home model has increased my liking for the company since everything is integrated into the EMR. The main problem with OSCAR systems is that not all hospitals are compatible with it and syncing medical records across two different systems is a pain. Telus has made their system compatible with a lot of rural hospitals and thus been able to connect the doctors offices with their local hospitals. \n      * I also considered Northwest Company, and in the future, when I have enough saved for a DRIP, I will be adding that to my TFSA also. The reasoning behind this is they have captured a niche market and are serving underserved areas and developing reliance on their product. The strength of this company is reflected in its' aggressive V-shaped recovery during the pandemic. \n      * I may also swap out ENB for AltaGas, but for now I am comfortable holding ENB at least for a year or so to see how it reacts to the market while I collect dividends. Though, eventually I'd like to transition out of oil and into renewable energy or possibly hold both at the same time depending on my cash at hand. \n* Currently I am DCA-ing my way into the positions of my core holdings. I have currently invested 50% of my total core holdings budget and have a remaining 50% currently sitting as cash, waiting to be deployed. I know everyone says you can't time the market and that's the reason I have decided to DCA - however, I feel like the current rally in markets is premature and a correction is on the horizon which is why I have paused my DCA contributions for now. I want to spread the money out for a longer period of time, possibly past September and into November and possibly even into December. \n* This is where I have my first question - am I just being overly speculative and cautious? Should I just blindly buy stocks systematically every two weeks or is my strategy to pause contributions viable? I found that I ended up DCA-ing upwards as the markets have rallied and missed out on opportunities which I wouldn't have missed out on if I had invested as a lump sum in March. \n* My secondary portfolio is a bit less organized. I have used this portfolio to buy and hold for a few days and then take profits. So basically swing trading, but I wish I had more cash so I could have held on to some of these for longer and bought them earlier. Here are a few trades that I made in the past:\n   * ATE.V: I've been holding this since early April. Currently sitting on about 500 shares. I believe in the product but boy, has management really been bad with communicating with their share holders. Its a long term play, and management has a decent strategy going forward and I will continue to hold unless the company shows signs of completely tanking. \n   * QSR: Bought and sold, made a few bucks in profit in early march. Never intended to hold this long term but I may reevaluate that in the future. Long term I would have to decide between this or A &amp; W income fund.\n   * ATZ: made a tidy profit off Aritizia too, looking to re enter possibly next quarter.\n   * ROOT: Same as ATZ. No intention of reentry. \n   * CGX: bought when it was around $12 and sold when it hit $14. No intention of reentry.\n   * MIR.V: made a 50% (FIFTY!) profit but only had about $50 to put in initially. Cashed out at $80. I want to re enter with about $1K on this.\n   * HR-UN: Yeah, I swing (swung?) traded a REIT. Bought at $8.20 and sold at $10.20 Would have liked to hold it longer but wanted to free up cash. Looking to re enter next quarter. \n   * BMO: So basically I had about $1K sitting in cash and BMO was lagging the other banks as the sector was recovering so I bought as much as I could. Now I feel trapped since I got a great deal at around $61 and am considering moving this to my core holdings, but I already have enough financial sector exposure in my core portfolio. I am up around 20% and feel like if I hold I can make more profit. I am also, at the same time, very tempted to liquidate and carry the funds forward into my future investments which I will highlight below. Any thoughts on strategy regarding this would be appreciated. \n* Future investments in my secondary portfolio:\n   * Currently I'm working on a strategy to invest with my secondary portfolio. Basically I just need to decide cut down this list to about 4-6 companies and decide on entry points:\n      * [WELL](https://WELL.TO)\n      * ATZ\n      * GOOS\n      * BB\n      * FLT\n      * LSPD\n      * CSH-UN\n      * HR-UN\n      * MIR.V\n      * I am also looking at the following but would need to research more and drop some other tickers to pick these up: SVI, PLC, TFII\n   * Basically, I am looking for value and growth in these companies and looking to enter with about $1k for each. Personally I am very drawn towards WELL, ATZ, GOOS, MIR, LSPD and CSH-UN\n* Another question I had was if I am swing trading, should I not do that in my TFSA? I can liquidate a few positions and put them into a taxable account just for swing trading. I would leave my secondary portfolio in my TFSA as a growth only portfolio and separate some funds solely for swing trading (basically play money). \n* Am I better off just converting my cash to USD and investing in TSLA, BRK.B, and Apple, AMD, etc?\n* The reason I am waiting for next quarter to re enter is because I fully believe there will be a market correction and a possible second downturn due to requirements for emergency subsidies being tightened up. The government can only sustain this for so long. Secondly, I don't think losses will be fully realized until next quarter. Thirdly, there is a possibility for a credit crisis and the big banks are fully expecting this which is why they increased their loss provisions according to the latest financial reports. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd now the age old question - \"Why not just buy a couple of ETfs and forget about it?\"\n\nI strongly considered XDV, XDIV, XEI as the majority investments in my core holdings along with a few exposure ETF's like TEC, VHT, some international exposure and small cap value ETFs.   \n\n\nWhy did I decide against it? I feel like ETFs offer less value when it comes to value investing. Sure, they dropped in price when the markets went down but I still feel like the rebound is dampened (as are the drops) which is to be expected because the risk is also lower. However, if I invest $1K into WELL for example, I will receive 100% of the value when it pops up, whereas if I purchase a small cap health/tech ETF which includes WELL,  the ETF would probably return much less value to me, not to mention that during re-balancing, the fund manager could classify WELL to be a large cap company and balance the company out of the ETF since it doesn't meet the requirements anymore and I would have to live with that decision, or go out and buy it but at that point I'd have missed out on most of the growth. \n\nSecondly, I found that most ETFs that hold Canadian banks have a lower dividend yield than if I had just held the banks directly. Granted, it wouldn't be at the same weight and I would probably only hold one or two banks instead of all 5 via an ETF but I don't really care for holding all 5 and especially so if the dividend yield is higher. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore I started investing, I paper traded for years just out of curiosity and I was always interested in stock prices. I did a lot of research and learning before starting to invest and felt like I knew what I was doing. Now I feel like I have no idea what I am doing (lol). My goal for the next year or so is to try and fully understand options trading in order to make weekly income, paper trade and develop a strategy and by next March start options trading. Currently learning about the wheel strategy and am really excited about trying it out. \n\nI also want to gain US market exposure, namely in the tech sector. I feel like a lot of growth is to be had there.\n\nPlease let me know what you think! I need to know where I stand with my investment strategy. Constructive criticism is most welcome!",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve been doing some research and noticed that in regards to a lot of the swings associated with COVID-19, some of the biggest losses are immediately followed big gains, only to have even bigger losses, sometimes in back to back days. For instance:\n\n(Numbers slightly rounded for convenience)\n\n03/09 DJIA dropped -2,000 (total loss 2,000)\n03/10 DJIA jumped +1,100 (total loss 900)\n03/11 DJIA dropped -1,400 (total loss 2,300)\n03/12 DJIA dropped -2,300 (total loss 4,600)\n03/13 DJIA jumped +1,900 (total loss 2,700)\n03/16 DJIA dropped -3,000 (total loss 5,700)\n\n*03-16 was the Monday immediately following the last market close, so still \u201cback-to-back\u201d technically\n\nOverall, a lot of the DJIA biggest ever point changes were bounces back after huge losses. Yesterday ranks as the 4th largest single point loss in Dow History. So a large correction in the opposite would be expected, given the current pattern witnessed. \n\nGranted the markets are volatile as hell as it is, but given what I\u2019ve seen I\u2019m betting on a bounce up today, probably in the 700-800 range followed by a large correction Monday. \n\nA lot of things went into play during this time frame and I\u2019m well aware of that, and I\u2019m looking at mainly just the swings themselves and may not be taking all variables into consideration (almost impossible to do). However, I am curious about others thoughts on this subject. \n\nAm I just being bearish in this mindset, or is the market set for another correction now that the fed has stated they expect the recovery to last a lot longer and not be as much of a \u201cV\u201d shape recovery?  Those of you who are much more experienced in this subject and have time to do more DD and analysis, please let me know your thoughts.",

        "selftext": "I am new and am trying to learn about reading candlestick charts. Im confused and cant seem to find a good video that explains the interpretation properly. \n\nSo i understand that a candlestick shows high low open close and whether the day was bullish or bearish. I am trying to understand how to better interpet wick length as compared to body. Basically, my interpretation is the following: \n\n* Bullish day with a long upper wick and small bottom wick: To me, this means that sellers tried to push the price higher and succeeded up to a certain point but failed. Buyers thought that the stock was not worth that much so buyers pushed the price down.\n* Bullish day with a short upper wick and a long bottom wick: To me, this means that buyers tried to push the price low but failed. Sellers kept the price higher. \n* Bearish day long upper wick small bottom wick: To me this means again sellers tried to push the price higher but ultimately they failed and buyers controlled the price and pushed it down.\n* Bearish day short upper wick long bottom wick: To me, this means again that sellers brought the price down significantly, but sellers ultimately took control and brought the price back up.\n\nAll in all, my interpretations of the candlesticks are based on the fact thought that: buyers will want the price to be lower so they get the stock cheap, and sellers will want the price higher so they can keep profits. \n\nI decided to check out this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3KRwfj9F8Q&amp;t=312s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3KRwfj9F8Q&amp;t=312s) and apparently my interpretation is completely wrong. At 4:11 he basically says a short upper wick on a bullish day with a long body, basically means buyers had control that day and had \"weak price rejection\". Similarly he says a long upper wick means \"strong price rejection\" and that the sellers were in control. \n\nHow does that make sense? wouldn't a seller want to sell as high as possible, and a buyer buy as low as possible?",

What do you think of this strategy?\n\nProfits from AAL: $183\n\nTotal Profits from Theta Strategies: $374\n\nAccount Value: $3000 thus roughly \\~12% Gain\n\nCCP=Cash Covered Put; CC=Covered Call; PCS=Put Credit Spread\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yx91j4xl1x451.png?width=2076&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=411ec824c568cf7d880b23bcbaf16d057f19b71a\n\nCash Covered Put\n\n* In this strategy we won\u2019t be buying put options, but instead we will be selling put options for premium\n* Remember, a put option gives the buyer the right to sell 100 shares of a stock at a certain strike price on or before the expiration day\n\nNow let\u2019s break down a Cash Covered Put:\n\n* Just like a typical Put option you have 3 parts to it: Strike Price, Premium, and Expiration Date\n* The key part of a Cash Covered Put is having enough money to buy 100 shares\n* Because by selling a put you are agreeing to a contract to buy the shares at the strike price and in return you get paid premium for this obligation\n* Having Cash available is key here because the whole idea behind this is if the price falls below the agreed upon strike price then you will be \u201cassigned\u201d shares aka forced to buy the shares at the agreed upon strike price.\n* Being forced to buy shares is the obligation you accepted when you chose to sell puts.\n* If you don\u2019t have the full cash amount available then you will be taking on those shares in margin, which I don\u2019t recommend unless you are an advanced investor. Just like margin can amplify gains it can amplify losses.\n* Now what is the goal here? \n   * The goal of selling puts is to collect premium. This strategy allows you to make money without ever owning the stock OR collect money as you wait for the stock\u2019s price to come down and you get assigned at the strike price you sold.\n\n[Cash Covered Puts Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDpMKDZdJe4)",

        "selftext": "**Investing guide**\n\n**Preface: Why I made this**\u00a0\n\nLet\u2019s start this guide off with an honest truth: I spend an unhealthy amount of time on Youtube. Whether it\u2019s watching Japanese sumo championships, video games I don\u2019t even play, or Mike Tyson absolutely annihilating anyone unlucky enough to box him: I love it all. Thankfully, some of my time has been put to good use. Over the past several years I have learned nearly everything I know about investing, almost exclusively through the platform, and that has changed my life. I have been investing in ETFs for the past 5 years, picking individual stocks for 2, and as of today (June 10, 2020) my portfolio is up over 60% overall. Investing, to me, is the path to financial freedom. The key to spending my life the way I desire and never needing to worry about money or slaving away at a job I don\u2019t enjoy.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ve been interested in investing since high school but I only just started recently because I had no clue where to begin, and entering the investing world intimidated the hell out of me. The education system provided me next to nothing in terms of personal finance, and anyone actually talking about it seemed like some sleaze bag that wanted to sell me something.\n\nI made this guide for anyone feeling that exact same way: I decided to slog through all the books and the hundreds of investment videos I have watched over the years to make a structured list of videos and personal notes that will give anyone, completely for free, the tools they need to begin investing and to succeed in creating wealth over the long term.\u00a0\n\n**Disclaimer:**\u00a0\n\nGetting through this guide will not be easy. At times it will suck, it will be boring, and it will be wildly time consuming. I have included many hours of videos and I expect you to watch each one. I want to be clear: If you cannot sit through a 45 minute video on how to learn to invest, then I would seriously reconsider investing at all. Patience is just as key in the markets as it is in learning new skills.\u00a0\n\nI encourage you to use this guide as an education tool, but not as the definitive answer for how to invest. It is undoubtedly prone to my personal bias and my style of investing, which may or may not not fit your own. Nothing in the investment world is gospel and it is imperative to develop your own strategies, to stay humble, and to continue educating yourself.\n\nHowever, I do believe this guide should provide you with everything you need to begin investing and to be successful in the long term. Most, but not all, of the links provided reflect my own personal investment style, but occasionally I will present several different ideas and allow you to decide what is best for your own portfolio. Almost all of the linked videos are by amazing Youtubers that have tons of additional content, each of them with their own strategies, opinions, and expertise. Check them out.\u00a0\n\nIf you decide you are ready to begin investing I have included my three brokerage recommendations at the bottom of the guide. Good luck!\n\n**Why should you invest?**\n\n[Why Investing is the Best Way to Get Rich | Phil Town](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOVamLc5Etc) -\u00a0\n\nEssential video\n\n[Fresh Prince - If we so rich....](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS5jqXWECbI) \\-\n\nUncle Phil explaining the worry free life investing can provide\n\n**Beginner**\u00a0\n\n[William Ackman: Everything You Need to Know About Finance and Investing in Under an Hour | Big Think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEDIj9JBTC8)\u00a0 \\-\u00a0\n\nThis is a great overview of investing and finance taught by Bill Ackman, who recently made the most successful trade of all time: turning 27 million into 2.6 billion dollars.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRY9gEuoWLA&amp;list=WL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRY9gEuoWLA&amp;list=WL) \\-\u00a0\n\nBroad beginner level investing video - what stocks are, where to buy them, how the buying process works, what brokerages to use, and strategies for protecting your money.

Covid has taught us that it is IMPERATIVE for a company to have cash on hand that can cover its short term debt obligations for a bare minimum of 1 quarter with no income. Some concepts in this video are pretty advanced, what I recommend is to \u2014at least\u2014 know how much cash the company currently has on hand in comparison to their current debt. This can be done on yahoo finance by looking at the company's balance sheet.\n\nIf the company has significantly more debt than cash on hand then you need to figure out how much of that debt is short term (due within the next 12 months). If their cash on hand cannot cover that debt, then this company is an extremely risky investment. If this company is forced to shut down for any reason and cannot gain profitable revenue then in-order to avoid bankruptcy they will be required to take out more debt (which will be lent at extremely unfavorable rates) or to issue more shares to avoid bankruptcy. This issuance will dilute the share count and hurt current investors, also the issued shares will be sold at current market price which is likely to be a very low price for the company.\u00a0\n\nBankruptcy totally wipes out the investor and your stock position will go to 0 as the company sells off its assets to pay off bond investors. If the company's assets value are above what they owe to bond holders then the remaining value will be distributed to shareholders.\u00a0\n\n[The Cost of Share Dilution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHAM0VSkqQg) \\-\u00a0\n\nShare dilution explained\n\n**Should I invest now or wait?**\n\n[A WARNING for ALL Investors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhYZU5uXmf4) \\-\u00a0\n\nTime in the market beats timing the market\n\n[The Best Investing Advice of 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKmJNvSvmKw) \\-\u00a0\n\nSame concept - you cannot time the market\u00a0\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqqfltv\\_cSI&amp;list=WL&amp;index=40&amp;t=0s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqqfltv_cSI&amp;list=WL&amp;index=40&amp;t=0s) \\-\u00a0\n\nExamination of the global economy using manufacturing numbers to consider the possibility of market recovery / another crash\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g32q6e3KZ5c&amp;t=320s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g32q6e3KZ5c&amp;t=320s) \\-\u00a0\n\nPresents the idea that holding dividend paying stocks and companies that continue to grow is more powerful than holding a cash position\u00a0\n\n[Waiting to Invest is Costing You...

The portfolio it builds is extremely diversified and managed by high level algorithms to insure your portfolio is properly balanced and not vulnerable to excess tax loss on realized gains.

I love Wealthfront and the instant, diverse portfolio that they provide which requires 0 work or attention from you personally - my portfolio with them is around 4 years old and currently up 40%.\u00a0\n\nUsing my link will give us both an additional 5000 dollars managed for no fees, and again, I would really appreciate it.\u00a0\n\n\\- redacted for post rules -\n\n**DISCLAIMER**\n\nAll information and data within this guide are solely for informational purposes.

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve been doing some research and noticed that in regards to a lot of the swings associated with COVID-19, some of the biggest losses are immediately followed big gains, only to have even bigger losses, sometimes in back to back days. For instance:\n\n(Numbers slightly rounded for convenience)\n\n03/09 DJIA dropped -2,000 (total loss 2,000)\n03/10 DJIA jumped +1,100 (total loss 900)\n03/11 DJIA dropped -1,400 (total loss 2,300)\n03/12 DJIA dropped -2,300 (total loss 4,600)\n03/13 DJIA jumped +1,900 (total loss 2,700)\n03/16 DJIA dropped -3,000 (total loss 5,700)\n\n*03-16 was the Monday immediately following the last market close, so still \u201cback-to-back\u201d technically\n\nOverall, a lot of the DJIA biggest ever point changes were bounces back after huge losses. Yesterday ranks as the 4th largest single point loss in Dow History. So a large correction in the opposite would be expected, given the current pattern witnessed. \n\nGranted the markets are volatile as hell as it is, but given what I\u2019ve seen I\u2019m betting on a bounce up today, probably in the 700-800 range followed by a large correction Monday. \n\nA lot of things went into play during this time frame and I\u2019m well aware of that, and I\u2019m looking at mainly just the swings themselves and may not be taking all variables into consideration (almost impossible to do). However, I am curious about others thoughts on this subject. \n\nAm I just being bearish in this mindset, or is the market set for another correction now that the fed has stated they expect the recovery to last a lot longer and not be as much of a \u201cV\u201d shape recovery?  Those of you who are much more experienced in this subject and have time to do more DD and analysis, please let me know your thoughts.",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 8th, 2020.\n\n# **Look for the S&amp;P 500 to turn positive for the year with a boost from the Fed in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/05/look-for-the-sp-500-to-turn-positive-for-the-year-with-a-boost-from-the-fed-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to reassure markets next week the central bank will do whatever it takes to help the economy heal. That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting is the big event for markets in the coming week. There are a few economic reports, including inflation data, the consumer price index Wednesday and producer prices Thursday. Weekly jobless claims will be important Thursday to see if there\u2019s a drop in continuing clams, after May\u2019s employment report showed a surprising record gain of 2.5 million jobs.\n*****\n&gt; The reopening trade was in full swing in the past week, especially Friday when stocks surged on the jobs report, which was expected to show a loss of 8.3 million jobs. The Nasdaq broke above its record high set on Feb. 19, and the S&amp;P 500 was just 1.1% away from turning positive for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Even before the jobs report, investors were loading up on financials, industrials, transports and small caps, which were up more than 8% for the week and 18.4% in the past month. S&amp;P financials were 12.1% higher on the week, S&amp;P industrials were up 10.5, and the NYSE airline index jumped more than 35.4.%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think next week is dominated by the reopening and it will be for another month,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. \u201cWith cyclicals outperforming, small [caps] outperforming, credit spreads coming in and then the bond yields going up, everybody \u2014 all facets of the financial markets \u2014 are sort of suggesting the same outcome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 3,193, a gain of 4.9%, and now traders are watching to see if it can scale the psychological 3,200 level. The Dow closed Friday at 27,110, up 6.8% for the week, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.4%, at 9,814 after reaching an intraday record high of 9,845 Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts say the market will likely look past the protests that broke out in cities across the U.S. after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Four policemen were charged with murder in his death. Looters joined the protests, some of which turned violent, but they quieted down towards the end of the week.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher for a third week in a row, but a change this past week has been the abrupt lurch higher in Treasury yields. The 10-year rose to a high of 0.95% Friday, a quarter-point move in just three sessions. The move was already underway but got a lift Wednesday when ADP jobs data was not nearly as bad as expected. Yields ripped even higher after the May employment report showed the unemployment rate actually fell to 13.3%, instead of climbing to 20%, as expected by economists.\n*****\n&gt; Bond strategists said the Treasury market was now acknowledging the potential for a recovery, but not in the exuberant way the stock market has been. Since March 23, the S&amp;P 500 has risen more than 45%, but it took the 10-year Treasury until this week to get back the yield level it was at when stocks bottomed.\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen said he believes a new bull market has been launched, but there could be pullbacks and some headwinds for the market coming up.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhen GDP is minus 30%, other issues don\u2019t matter. There\u2019s just one issue. But as the economy reopens again, the trade battles will matter again, presidential politics will matter again,\u201d said Paulsen, adding the budget deficit could also matter. \u201cI think we\u2019ll get removed from a sole focus. That isn\u2019t quite there but I think it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed begins its two-day meeting Tuesday, and will release its statement Wednesday afternoon, followed by a video briefing by Powell.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhey would the Fed want to disrupt this with anything?\u201d Paulsen said. \u201cThey\u2019re still going to support the economy. They\u2019re going to stay away from negative rates or yield curve management. They\u2019re not going to do anything to scare the markets. They might certainly reassure people that they are still ready to provide support.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America, said the Fed may clarify where it stands on some of the extraordinary moves it has taken since it cut rates to zero. The Fed has been supporting the markets with asset purchases and multiple programs for commercial paper, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds, for example.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe think right now they\u2019re just trying to get this Main Street lending program to work. The question is are they going to do more things around what they do in terms of forward guidance and next steps of macro easing,\u201d Harris said.\n*****\n&gt; There has been speculation that the Fed would do some type of so-called yield curve control, a program to keep interest rates capped at certain levels. \u201cI think it\u2019s too early for that,\u201d said Harris. He said the Fed would be guaranteeing low rates for a long period of time if it does yield curve control.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYield curve control is basically open-ended quantitative easing,\u201d he said. The Fed is currently buying Treasurys but if it wanted to stop yields from rising too much as the economy improves, it could make targeted purchases.\n*****\n&gt; Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said it\u2019s possible the Fed could announce the yield curve control. \u201cWe\u2019ve said they could implement yield curve control out to three years,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my mind that matches the length of the horizon of the economic projections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Powell has said the economy needs more fiscal help, and he could reiterate those comments Wednesday. President Donald Trump on Friday said he backs more stimulus. So far, the Democrats have put out a marker with their wish list for further spending, but there have been no negotiations.\n*****\n&gt; There was concern the strong jobs report could make it harder to get buy in for another big spending package. But some economists say the recovery needs a boost and states need funding to fill the holes in their budgets from coronavirus-related spending and a lack of tax receipts.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7klaXQm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PKTBzT2.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/a5JkAB6.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/M2x4Qoq.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qtJYfXN.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bjiJWjV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UAi19KJ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GQm4ruO.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uV1U7FN.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/wm2XJND.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yarkiMO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hFblu2G.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Stocks Outpacing Analyst Price Targets\n\n&gt; This morning's jobs report shocked the financial world -- most notably the economists whose job it is to provide estimates. The consensus estimate among economists for May nonfarm payrolls was projecting a loss of more than 7 million jobs. The actual number that was reported did not just show a smaller than expected job loss, but it actually showed a gain in jobs of more than 2.5 million.\n\n&gt; We're seeing a similar situation play out in the equity analyst community. With the S&amp;P 500 now up 40%+ since its low less than three months ago, the average stock in the index is now trading above its consensus analyst price target that looks 12 months out. Analysts have simply not been able to catch up to the rapid rise we've seen for equity prices.\n\n&gt; It's extremely rare to see share prices move above consensus analyst price targets. We don't have the historical daily data on this, but anecdotally we can't remember a time when the spread has been this wide. As shown below, at the end of 2019 when the S&amp;P finished a massive rally, equity prices were 5.5% below the consensus price target. That was seen as a very tight spread prior to what we're seeing now. At the lows in March, the average share price had dropped all the way to $92.50 compared to an average consensus price target of $143.20. That projected a gain of 54.9% at the time!\n\n&gt; Since March 23rd, the average share price has risen from $92.50 up to $138.40, while the average analyst price target has fallen from $143.20 to $136. Current price targets no longer project a gain for the average S&amp;P 500 stock, but rather a 1.7% drop.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/avgpricetarget.png))**\n\n&gt; # Nasdaq's Historical Run\n\n&gt; At its highs earlier this morning, the Nasdaq Composite was within 2% of its record high from earlier in the year. Besides the steep V-shape of the Nasdaq's pattern over the last four months, the other aspect of the chart that stands out is just how steep the 50-day moving average is trending lately.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-50DMAa.png))**\n\n&gt; To illustrate just how steep the Nasdaq's 50-DMA has become, the chart below shows the daily percentage change of the 50-day going back to 1971. Currently, the Nasdaq 50-DMA is rising at an average of over 0.5% per day. That's an incredible slope and a level that has been exceeded only a handful of times in the Nasdaq's 50-year history.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-Composite1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Big Gains From Smaller Tech\n\n&gt; It's still difficult to fathom the moves in the US equity market over the last four months. The fact that the Nasdaq and more specifically the Technology sector aren't far from record highs is definitely something no one was expecting two months ago. There's an old market saying that equities take the stairs up and the elevator down, but in the latest market cycle, the elevator up was almost as fast as the way down!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Nasdaq.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Technology-Sector.png))**\n\n&gt; If you've been following the markets, all you've likely heard up until recently is that large-cap tech, and more specifically, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Facebook (FB), are single-handedly driving the market higher. The reality is not nearly as clear-cut. Given their market caps, the \"Big 5\" (as they're often referred to) have done a lot of heavy lifting, but in terms of performance, they're hardly the only game in town.\n\n&gt; The table below lists Technology sector stocks in the Russell 3000 with market caps of more than $1 billion that are outperforming all of the 'big 5' tech stocks on a YTD basis. Actually, since Amazon is doing so well relative to the rest of the \"big 5\" these are all stocks that are outperforming Amazon. If we looked for stocks that were doing better than the average return of the \"big 5\" the list would be a lot, lot longer (+16.4%).\n\n&gt; Looking through the list of names below, the two top-performing names are Zscaler (ZS) and Twilio (TWLO), which have both more than doubled. Behind these two, DocuSign (DOCU) and Sprout Social (SPT) are both knocking on the door of triple-digits. All 28 of the names listed have market caps of $1 billion, but the average market cap is just over $21 billion, while Nvidia (NVDA) is the largest company on the list with a market cap of $216 billion. For the most part, these aren't names that have been driving the indices, but anyone holding these stocks in their portfolio probably doesn't care!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Tech-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Best 50-Day Rally Ever\n\n&gt; In many ways, what we\u2019ve seen so far in 2020 has been both record-breaking and devastating. From the S&amp;P 500 Index peak on February 19 to the bear market lows March 23, stocks lost 33.9%. Now, 50 trading days later, stocks have gained 39.6%, for the largest 50-day rally since the S&amp;P 500 moved to 500 stocks in 1957.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere are no rollercoasters that can replicate what stocks have done so far in 2020,\u201d exclaimed LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHere\u2019s the catch though: Big 50-day rallies in the past have taken place near the start of new bull markets, and the returns going out a year were quite bullish.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 39.6% gain in 50 days was the greatest 50-day rally ever, besting the previous best in October 1982. What\u2019s important to note here is that many of these rallies took place coming off major market lows, and delivered quite strong returns going out 6 to 12 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/best-fifty-days.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Although we have near-term worries given this historic run, as some sentiment indicators such as put/call ratios are showing some froth, from a bigger picture perspective, this strong 50-day rally offers a reason to think stock prices may be even higher this time next year.\n\n*****\n\n# 2020 In Charts\n\n&gt; 2020 is only five months old, but in many ways it is one of the most historic years we\u2019ve ever seen. \u201c2020 went from moving along nicely, to seeing the worst recession in a generation and the fastest bear market ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cNow stocks are in the midst of one of the best bull runs ever, even though the economy remains extremely weak, thanks to record stimulus and hopes over a vaccine.\u201d\n&gt; \nTo best sum it all up, here are 10 charts that tell the picture of 2020 so far.\n\n&gt; 1.) The 2010s were the first decade in history to go all 10 years without a recession, which of course ended just months into the new decade, as the economy stopped. Stocks gained 13.5% on an annual basis last decade, surprisingly, only the third-best decade over the past four.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 2.) This is an election year, and the S&amp;P 500 Index hasn\u2019t been lower when a President is up for reelection since FDR in 1940. Although this seemed nearly impossible at the March lows, it is looking like this incredible streak could have a chance in 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 3.) One of the first signs something could go wrong in 2020 was stocks fell in January. Historically, this has meant potential trouble for the final 11 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 4.) As fears over COVID-19 gripped the world, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its fastest bear market ever, in only 19 days. To put this in perspective, this was the fastest bear market in the 124-year history of the Dow.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 5.) Mark Twain said \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes\u201d. Looking at history, every 50 years there has been a terrible pandemic and stocks fell more than 30%. We don\u2019t know if the ultimate lows are in this time, but so far, history is rhyming.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 6.) More than 20 million people in the US lost their jobs in April, while the unemployment rate soared to near 15%, the highest since the Great Depression. Record drops in manufacturing, industrial production, retail sales, and consumer spending have all taken place in the past two months as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 7.) A recession is here, ending the streak of 128 months in a row without one. What is unique about the previous expansion was nominal gross domestic product (GDP) grew only 50%, about the average growth seen during the previous expansions, but this expansion was nearly twice as long as the average expansion (10 years versus 5 years).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 8.) The bounce off of the March 23 S&amp;P 500 lows has been historic in many ways. In fact, it was one of the best 20-day rallies ever, with previous best rallies seeing strong returns 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 9.) As scary as it was on the way down, stocks have come roaring back, gaining more than 35% from the March 23 lows. This would classify as the greatest bear market bounce ever, which opens the question: is this more than a bear market bounce and instead the start of a new bull market?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 10.) The number of COVID-19 tests in the US nearly doubled in May versus what was seen in April. Additionally, fewer and fewer tests are coming back positive. Testing is one of the key ways we will beat this and this is a step in the right direction.

        "selftext": "Hey guys. Self described medical-expert here to give you the daily update on the 'rona. I am here to reassure that the Media narrative being spun is FUD, and anyone who fearmongers is a PEDO GUY. I am going to use FACTS and DATA to CRUSH the doubters. \n\nDaily confirmed cases in US is trending DOWN WITH A TINY UPTICK over last week.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/GTRpv3b\n\nYes, there's a small uptick over last week, but with the mass protests occurring now two weeks ago, the notion that we are going to see runaway exponentials beginning again looks extremely unlikely -- a tiny little bump which won't repeat because the protests and the ending of the lockdowns are factors that won't repeat. So we are fine, I'd bet anything and am.\n\nConfirmed deaths looks even better, a straight line downward -- this makes sense too. People are enjoying the sunshine again, higher Vitamin D levels are protecting people.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gBX5weQ\n\nSource on Vitamin D: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-21211/v1\n\nVitamin D is not technically a Vitamin, but a hormone. It protects against viruses, it increases your testosterone levels and protects against obesity and health problems. One of the reasons African-Americans are susceptible to the 'rona is lower vitamin D, also obesity which is itself partly a result of lower Vitamin D. Being low D is the same as being low T.\n\n\nWe can see there are some countries having problems with the 'rona -- Brazil, India are the two biggest. One locked down and the other didn't (Totalitarianism doesn't work!). Both are poor countries with mega-slums. Both are equatorial nations which is why their spike took longer to happen. In the US, most of our people who were highly susceptible to the virus already got infected during the Winter which is why our Summer is looking so good. Brazilians are less rule-abiding than Indians which is why they have a bigger number.\n\nThe seasonal impact from this virus is now undeniable. Countries with exponential curves right now are all equatorial or Southern hemisphere, northern hemisphere is looking fantastic.\n\nThat unfortunately means that there WILL be a second wave in the fall. Make sure you TAN, get the SUNSHINE, make sure you LIFT. Make sure you take Vitamin D to INGEST SUNSHINE IN PILL FORM.\n\nMake sure you stay within six feet of ROBINHOOD USERS and anyone who buys HTZ or CHK and take off your mask and breathe directly into their faces. Let's make the market efficient again!\n\nToday I sold my puts up 40%. I am usually always wrong on my market timing, but that being said:\n\nWe have a V-shaped recovery and an unlimited money printer so I would continue to err on the side of bullishness. I fully believe we continue to set all-time highs in the coming weeks. This is a bear trap! Bet on America.",

It HAS to. However, we won't will see a massive drop in prices. At worst it will be 20%-30% drop in prices. However, I expect a V shaped recovery from the crash. I am currently 25% cash. I am sure there are many investors sitting in the sidelines sitting with mountains of cash waiting to jump right back in and will do so the moment a crash occurs triggering a recovery.\n\nOne of the tragedies of the 21st century is the massive income inequalities in our society. This means the wall street doesn't care about unemployment numbers. People with money will always have money to invest regardless of unemployment numbers and will constantly be looking forward for bargains. Add to that currently there is no safer and better investment than stocks (other than real estate which is a logistical nightmare to invest in). \n\nTLDR: Massive concentration of wealth will result in V shaped recovery when crash (20%-30%) occurs.",

However, I can't decide between which of these stocks would be the better investment, assuming I'm planning to hold for 5-10 years. Between AAPL and MSFT, I believe both will perform phenomenally over the next 10 years, but I can't decide which would be the better pick. NFLX is dominating right now and believe they will prevail over Disney+ and Amazon Prime. For MA, I believe it will outperform V as it has been growing faster and is slowly gaining popularity.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 8th, 2020.\n\n# **Look for the S&amp;P 500 to turn positive for the year with a boost from the Fed in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/05/look-for-the-sp-500-to-turn-positive-for-the-year-with-a-boost-from-the-fed-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to reassure markets next week the central bank will do whatever it takes to help the economy heal. That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting is the big event for markets in the coming week. There are a few economic reports, including inflation data, the consumer price index Wednesday and producer prices Thursday. Weekly jobless claims will be important Thursday to see if there\u2019s a drop in continuing clams, after May\u2019s employment report showed a surprising record gain of 2.5 million jobs.\n*****\n&gt; The reopening trade was in full swing in the past week, especially Friday when stocks surged on the jobs report, which was expected to show a loss of 8.3 million jobs. The Nasdaq broke above its record high set on Feb. 19, and the S&amp;P 500 was just 1.1% away from turning positive for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Even before the jobs report, investors were loading up on financials, industrials, transports and small caps, which were up more than 8% for the week and 18.4% in the past month. S&amp;P financials were 12.1% higher on the week, S&amp;P industrials were up 10.5, and the NYSE airline index jumped more than 35.4.%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think next week is dominated by the reopening and it will be for another month,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. \u201cWith cyclicals outperforming, small [caps] outperforming, credit spreads coming in and then the bond yields going up, everybody \u2014 all facets of the financial markets \u2014 are sort of suggesting the same outcome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 3,193, a gain of 4.9%, and now traders are watching to see if it can scale the psychological 3,200 level. The Dow closed Friday at 27,110, up 6.8% for the week, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.4%, at 9,814 after reaching an intraday record high of 9,845 Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts say the market will likely look past the protests that broke out in cities across the U.S. after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Four policemen were charged with murder in his death. Looters joined the protests, some of which turned violent, but they quieted down towards the end of the week.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher for a third week in a row, but a change this past week has been the abrupt lurch higher in Treasury yields. The 10-year rose to a high of 0.95% Friday, a quarter-point move in just three sessions. The move was already underway but got a lift Wednesday when ADP jobs data was not nearly as bad as expected. Yields ripped even higher after the May employment report showed the unemployment rate actually fell to 13.3%, instead of climbing to 20%, as expected by economists.\n*****\n&gt; Bond strategists said the Treasury market was now acknowledging the potential for a recovery, but not in the exuberant way the stock market has been. Since March 23, the S&amp;P 500 has risen more than 45%, but it took the 10-year Treasury until this week to get back the yield level it was at when stocks bottomed.\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen said he believes a new bull market has been launched, but there could be pullbacks and some headwinds for the market coming up.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhen GDP is minus 30%, other issues don\u2019t matter. There\u2019s just one issue. But as the economy reopens again, the trade battles will matter again, presidential politics will matter again,\u201d said Paulsen, adding the budget deficit could also matter. \u201cI think we\u2019ll get removed from a sole focus. That isn\u2019t quite there but I think it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed begins its two-day meeting Tuesday, and will release its statement Wednesday afternoon, followed by a video briefing by Powell.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhey would the Fed want to disrupt this with anything?\u201d Paulsen said. \u201cThey\u2019re still going to support the economy. They\u2019re going to stay away from negative rates or yield curve management. They\u2019re not going to do anything to scare the markets. They might certainly reassure people that they are still ready to provide support.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America, said the Fed may clarify where it stands on some of the extraordinary moves it has taken since it cut rates to zero. The Fed has been supporting the markets with asset purchases and multiple programs for commercial paper, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds, for example.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe think right now they\u2019re just trying to get this Main Street lending program to work. The question is are they going to do more things around what they do in terms of forward guidance and next steps of macro easing,\u201d Harris said.\n*****\n&gt; There has been speculation that the Fed would do some type of so-called yield curve control, a program to keep interest rates capped at certain levels. \u201cI think it\u2019s too early for that,\u201d said Harris. He said the Fed would be guaranteeing low rates for a long period of time if it does yield curve control.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYield curve control is basically open-ended quantitative easing,\u201d he said. The Fed is currently buying Treasurys but if it wanted to stop yields from rising too much as the economy improves, it could make targeted purchases.\n*****\n&gt; Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said it\u2019s possible the Fed could announce the yield curve control. \u201cWe\u2019ve said they could implement yield curve control out to three years,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my mind that matches the length of the horizon of the economic projections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Powell has said the economy needs more fiscal help, and he could reiterate those comments Wednesday. President Donald Trump on Friday said he backs more stimulus. So far, the Democrats have put out a marker with their wish list for further spending, but there have been no negotiations.\n*****\n&gt; There was concern the strong jobs report could make it harder to get buy in for another big spending package. But some economists say the recovery needs a boost and states need funding to fill the holes in their budgets from coronavirus-related spending and a lack of tax receipts.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7klaXQm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PKTBzT2.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/a5JkAB6.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/M2x4Qoq.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qtJYfXN.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bjiJWjV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UAi19KJ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GQm4ruO.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uV1U7FN.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/wm2XJND.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yarkiMO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hFblu2G.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Stocks Outpacing Analyst Price Targets\n\n&gt; This morning's jobs report shocked the financial world -- most notably the economists whose job it is to provide estimates. The consensus estimate among economists for May nonfarm payrolls was projecting a loss of more than 7 million jobs. The actual number that was reported did not just show a smaller than expected job loss, but it actually showed a gain in jobs of more than 2.5 million.\n\n&gt; We're seeing a similar situation play out in the equity analyst community. With the S&amp;P 500 now up 40%+ since its low less than three months ago, the average stock in the index is now trading above its consensus analyst price target that looks 12 months out. Analysts have simply not been able to catch up to the rapid rise we've seen for equity prices.\n\n&gt; It's extremely rare to see share prices move above consensus analyst price targets. We don't have the historical daily data on this, but anecdotally we can't remember a time when the spread has been this wide. As shown below, at the end of 2019 when the S&amp;P finished a massive rally, equity prices were 5.5% below the consensus price target. That was seen as a very tight spread prior to what we're seeing now. At the lows in March, the average share price had dropped all the way to $92.50 compared to an average consensus price target of $143.20. That projected a gain of 54.9% at the time!\n\n&gt; Since March 23rd, the average share price has risen from $92.50 up to $138.40, while the average analyst price target has fallen from $143.20 to $136. Current price targets no longer project a gain for the average S&amp;P 500 stock, but rather a 1.7% drop.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/avgpricetarget.png))**\n\n&gt; # Nasdaq's Historical Run\n\n&gt; At its highs earlier this morning, the Nasdaq Composite was within 2% of its record high from earlier in the year. Besides the steep V-shape of the Nasdaq's pattern over the last four months, the other aspect of the chart that stands out is just how steep the 50-day moving average is trending lately.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-50DMAa.png))**\n\n&gt; To illustrate just how steep the Nasdaq's 50-DMA has become, the chart below shows the daily percentage change of the 50-day going back to 1971. Currently, the Nasdaq 50-DMA is rising at an average of over 0.5% per day. That's an incredible slope and a level that has been exceeded only a handful of times in the Nasdaq's 50-year history.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-Composite1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Big Gains From Smaller Tech\n\n&gt; It's still difficult to fathom the moves in the US equity market over the last four months. The fact that the Nasdaq and more specifically the Technology sector aren't far from record highs is definitely something no one was expecting two months ago. There's an old market saying that equities take the stairs up and the elevator down, but in the latest market cycle, the elevator up was almost as fast as the way down!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Nasdaq.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Technology-Sector.png))**\n\n&gt; If you've been following the markets, all you've likely heard up until recently is that large-cap tech, and more specifically, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Facebook (FB), are single-handedly driving the market higher. The reality is not nearly as clear-cut. Given their market caps, the \"Big 5\" (as they're often referred to) have done a lot of heavy lifting, but in terms of performance, they're hardly the only game in town.\n\n&gt; The table below lists Technology sector stocks in the Russell 3000 with market caps of more than $1 billion that are outperforming all of the 'big 5' tech stocks on a YTD basis. Actually, since Amazon is doing so well relative to the rest of the \"big 5\" these are all stocks that are outperforming Amazon. If we looked for stocks that were doing better than the average return of the \"big 5\" the list would be a lot, lot longer (+16.4%).\n\n&gt; Looking through the list of names below, the two top-performing names are Zscaler (ZS) and Twilio (TWLO), which have both more than doubled. Behind these two, DocuSign (DOCU) and Sprout Social (SPT) are both knocking on the door of triple-digits. All 28 of the names listed have market caps of $1 billion, but the average market cap is just over $21 billion, while Nvidia (NVDA) is the largest company on the list with a market cap of $216 billion. For the most part, these aren't names that have been driving the indices, but anyone holding these stocks in their portfolio probably doesn't care!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Tech-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Best 50-Day Rally Ever\n\n&gt; In many ways, what we\u2019ve seen so far in 2020 has been both record-breaking and devastating. From the S&amp;P 500 Index peak on February 19 to the bear market lows March 23, stocks lost 33.9%. Now, 50 trading days later, stocks have gained 39.6%, for the largest 50-day rally since the S&amp;P 500 moved to 500 stocks in 1957.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere are no rollercoasters that can replicate what stocks have done so far in 2020,\u201d exclaimed LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHere\u2019s the catch though: Big 50-day rallies in the past have taken place near the start of new bull markets, and the returns going out a year were quite bullish.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 39.6% gain in 50 days was the greatest 50-day rally ever, besting the previous best in October 1982. What\u2019s important to note here is that many of these rallies took place coming off major market lows, and delivered quite strong returns going out 6 to 12 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/best-fifty-days.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Although we have near-term worries given this historic run, as some sentiment indicators such as put/call ratios are showing some froth, from a bigger picture perspective, this strong 50-day rally offers a reason to think stock prices may be even higher this time next year.\n\n*****\n\n# 2020 In Charts\n\n&gt; 2020 is only five months old, but in many ways it is one of the most historic years we\u2019ve ever seen. \u201c2020 went from moving along nicely, to seeing the worst recession in a generation and the fastest bear market ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cNow stocks are in the midst of one of the best bull runs ever, even though the economy remains extremely weak, thanks to record stimulus and hopes over a vaccine.\u201d\n&gt; \nTo best sum it all up, here are 10 charts that tell the picture of 2020 so far.\n\n&gt; 1.) The 2010s were the first decade in history to go all 10 years without a recession, which of course ended just months into the new decade, as the economy stopped. Stocks gained 13.5% on an annual basis last decade, surprisingly, only the third-best decade over the past four.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 2.) This is an election year, and the S&amp;P 500 Index hasn\u2019t been lower when a President is up for reelection since FDR in 1940. Although this seemed nearly impossible at the March lows, it is looking like this incredible streak could have a chance in 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 3.) One of the first signs something could go wrong in 2020 was stocks fell in January. Historically, this has meant potential trouble for the final 11 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 4.) As fears over COVID-19 gripped the world, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its fastest bear market ever, in only 19 days. To put this in perspective, this was the fastest bear market in the 124-year history of the Dow.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 5.) Mark Twain said \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes\u201d. Looking at history, every 50 years there has been a terrible pandemic and stocks fell more than 30%. We don\u2019t know if the ultimate lows are in this time, but so far, history is rhyming.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 6.) More than 20 million people in the US lost their jobs in April, while the unemployment rate soared to near 15%, the highest since the Great Depression. Record drops in manufacturing, industrial production, retail sales, and consumer spending have all taken place in the past two months as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 7.) A recession is here, ending the streak of 128 months in a row without one. What is unique about the previous expansion was nominal gross domestic product (GDP) grew only 50%, about the average growth seen during the previous expansions, but this expansion was nearly twice as long as the average expansion (10 years versus 5 years).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 8.) The bounce off of the March 23 S&amp;P 500 lows has been historic in many ways. In fact, it was one of the best 20-day rallies ever, with previous best rallies seeing strong returns 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 9.) As scary as it was on the way down, stocks have come roaring back, gaining more than 35% from the March 23 lows. This would classify as the greatest bear market bounce ever, which opens the question: is this more than a bear market bounce and instead the start of a new bull market?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 10.) The number of COVID-19 tests in the US nearly doubled in May versus what was seen in April. Additionally, fewer and fewer tests are coming back positive. Testing is one of the key ways we will beat this and this is a step in the right direction. We\u2019ve also seen new monthly lows in people on ventilators, in the ICU, and in hospitals.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Hard to believe, but there are still 7 months left in 2020. It hasn\u2019t been easy for any of us, and we continue to keep everyone impacted by this pandemic in mind, but we continue to see the glass as half full. The dual benefit of record monetary and fiscal policy should help create a bridge to help those most impacted, while the economy can slowly come back online later this year.\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$ADBE** \n&gt; * **$UNFI** \n&gt; * **$CHWY** \n&gt; * **$TIF** \n&gt; * **$LULU** \n&gt; * **$COUP** \n&gt; * **$SFIX** \n&gt; * **$LOVE** \n&gt; * **$NEPT** \n&gt; * **$GHM** \n&gt; * **$REVG** \n&gt; * **$GME** \n&gt; * **$HDS** \n&gt; * **$FIVE** \n&gt; * **$SIG** \n&gt; * **$CASY** \n&gt; * **$CVGW** \n&gt; * **$AMC** \n&gt; * **$FCEL** \n&gt; * **$QTNT** \n&gt; * **$PLCE** \n&gt; * **$CHS** \n&gt; * **$THO** \n&gt; * **$GCO** \n&gt; * **$BF.B** \n&gt; * **$LMNR** \n&gt; * **$WSG** \n&gt; * **$PRTY** \n&gt; * **$GES** \n&gt; * **$BBCP** \n&gt; * **$CONN** \n&gt; * **$HEXO** \n&gt; * **$PHR** \n&gt; * **$PVH** \n&gt; * **$RRGB** \n&gt; * **$PLAY** \n&gt; * **$TNP** \n&gt; * **$JW.A** \n&gt; * **$SB** \n&gt; * **$GSM** \n&gt; * **$SRT**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/bgPdMCr.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.8.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/d2EW1kr.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uxSiJJr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.9.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3SIjcG7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cRBrPlt.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.10.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DaheXAm.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9mcHxTl.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.11.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/i8SNjWM.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9xcBZPK.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.12.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Inc. $392.90\n&gt; **Adobe Inc.

        "selftext": "The Oracle of Omaha has a reputation as the gentle GOAT, but is there more to this than meets the eye?\n\nIs there something that is often overlooked?\n\nOr is this reputation warranted? (get it...warren, warranted?)\n\nAnyway...Let's begin...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe story begins in 1942, when Warren Buffet bought his first shares at the age of just 11. \n\nThis is same year that his father Howard Buffett ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in the Nebraska district.\n\nHe won, and became a member of Congress in 1943.\n\nBefore this, Howard worked at a small stock brokerage firm.\n\nHe was reelected twice. However, in 1952, he decided against seeking another term and returned to his investment business in Omaha,\u00a0Buffett-Falk &amp; Co., where he worked until shortly before his death in 1964.\n\nBut what about Warren Buffett?\n\nIn 1951, after graduating from Columbia, where he was taught by Benjamin Graham, Buffett worked for three years at his father's firm as an investment salesman. \n\nIn 1954, Buffett accepted a job at Benjamin Graham's partnership, working as a securities analyst.\n\nHis starting salary was $12,000 a year - the equivalent of $114,000 today.\n\nHowever, just two years later, Graham retired and Buffett started his own investment partnership.\n\nHe went to his father's acquaintances to raise Capital for his first fund. \n\nThese were prominent families in Nebraska with big businesses and political connections.\n\nFor example, across the street was the family whose son became the CEO of Coca Cola - that family gave him $10,000.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn 2012, the STOCK Act or The Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act was signed into law.\u00a0 \n\nThe law prohibits the use of non-public information for private profit, including insider trading by members of Congress and other government employees.\n\nRemember, Buffett's father used to be in Congress.\n\n***The only people who were, before 2012, allowed to trade on insider information without having criminal charges brought against them were congressmen.***\n\nRemember, Buffett's father was a stock market broker prior to being elected and going to Congress, hence he had a comprehensive knowledge of the stock market and clearly had an interest in it. \n\nAfter all, it was his father who taught Buffett the ropes early on and had him buy his first shares as an eleven year old.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImagine you are Warren Buffett, and you can:\n\n1). Get insider information to trade on it;\n\n2). Get a six-figure position after College;\n\n3). After a few years, set up your own fund, getting money from wealthy family friends;\n\n4). Pay no dividends to investors and only put a hundred bucks of your own money into the fund;\n\n5). Let the mathematics of compounding work its magic as you bring in more institutional money;\n\n6). Become so connected Politically and connected on Wall Street that you can get special deals, which have practically no risk as you know bailouts are coming. For example, in the 2008 crisis, Berkshire owned stock valued at more than $13 billion in the top recipients of the TARP funds, and Berkshire had at least twice as much dependence on bailed-out banks as any other large investor;\n\n7). Have billions of dollars on hand, remember you aren't paying any dividends to investors, ready for the inevitable economic recession to hit so that you can sweep up cheap assets;\n\n8). Be holier-than-thou (i.e. calling derivatives \"financial weapons of mass destruction\" when, during the height of the 2008 crisis, Berkshire sold more than $2.5 billion worth of credit default swaps. OR what about Buffett's reputation as the saviour in the Great Recession when Berkshire is the majority owner of Moody's, who played a key role in inflating the crisis in 2008 - via their questionable debt and derivative ratings which inflated the mortgage and subprime market).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat about Buffett's status as the GOAT?\n\n[Jim Simons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcy8QaILDJI) has a far superior track record.\n\nBillionaire Chamath Palihapitiya has even stated that [Jeff Bezos is the best investor of our generation](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/12/chamath-palihapitiya-amazons-jeff-bezos-the-best-investor-better-than-warren-buffett.html#:~:text=Chamath%20Palihapitiya%20calls%20Amazon's%20Jeff%20Bezos,investor%2C%20better%20than%20Warren%20Buffett&amp;text=%E2%80%9CPeople%20used%20to%20lambaste%20Jeff,said%20on%20%E2%80%9CSquawk%20Box.%E2%80%9D), not Warren Buffett.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBuffett has missed out on an entire raft of tech and Berkshire has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 in recent years.\n\nBerkshire's best years are found overwhelmingly in the period before the tech era.\n\nAlso, he has been critical of Bitcoin, describing it as \"rat poison squared\"\n\nUltimately, Buffett is worth $73 billion, he doesn't need to have an in-depth understanding of new age tech.\n\nMoreover, Buffett has a huge stake in Finance 1.0, why would he give props to Finance 2.0?\n\nBitcoin as a savings vehicle is misaligned with Berkshire's don't-save-money-invest-it-in-us or consume more of the products of the businesses that Berkshire has a huge stake in, and is also misaligned with Berkshire's Cantillon insider advantages.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's worth noting that Howard Buffett strongly supported the gold standard because he believed it would limit the ability of government to inflate the money supply and spend beyond its means. Here is a direct quote from Howard:\n\n***\"I warn you that politicians of both parties will oppose the restoration of gold, although they may outwardly seemingly favor it,\u00a0unless you are willing to surrender your children and your country to galloping inflation, war and slavery\u00a0then this cause demands your support. For if human liberty is to survive in America, we must win the battle to restore honest money. There is no more important challenge facing us than this issue -- the restoration of your freedom to secure gold in exchange for the fruits of your labors.\"***\n\nHis son Warren, however, hates gold. See the [Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs) as to why.\n\n**Some have even argued that Buffett's success can be summarised by the following:**\n\n**First Deals = Insider Information**\n\n**Last Deals = Cantillon Effect**\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nIs it true... or false?\n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UpTUBgUYgc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UpTUBgUYgc)",

        "selftext": "Hey. Let me tell you what to short when the bears feast so you won't be caught with your pants around your ankles. Bookmark this for when the time comes.\n\n# I. Back-story: March Liquidity Madness\n\n(Skip to part Dos if you have a better memory than a goldfish.)\n\nKnown unknowns, like the spread of COVID-19, US-Iran tensions, supply chain and demand impact, the oil shock, and unknown unknowns injected fear into the market.\n\nFear of a liquidity crisis crashed the market. It would have been far bloodier if JPow hadn't stepped in, using QE infinity to fill the wound with [trillions of dollars](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_recenttrends.htm).\n\nThis monopoly money pump carried (is carrying) the rally longer than even permabulls expected.\n\n# II. Why This Doesn't Solve Underlying Problems\n\nLiquidity problems are a bygone memory, but solvency is *still* a nagging fear.\n\nWhen millions of jobs were lost, many of you said \"they'll come back when the \ud83c\udf7a\ud83e\udda0 / lockdown is over!\"\n\n[They didn't](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000). Consumers aren't spending, it's been 2 months since Trump Bux came in the mail, enhanced unemployment allowances expire next month, corporate debt is rocketing - all this speaks to a looming solvency issue.\n\nMany of you bears have given up on the market, resigning to the belief that \"economic data doesn't matter anymore.\"\n\nIn a bubble, you're right. A bubble will inflate as long as exuberance dominates over reality, but reality eventually comes knocking.\n\nOtherwise, \ud83c\udd71\ufe0fit-c-o-\u2139\ufe0f-n would be @ $500,000, and the SPY $500 memes would soon become prophecies.\n\nI'm not going to join the screeching chorus of false prophets by telling you when the next leg down will be, though if I had to guess, it'll be in November, where any situation looks bad for the market.\n\nIf Donny Pump solidifies his next term, he no longer has to worry about \"[STOCK MARKET @ ALL-TIME HIGH](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1215299143066947584?lang=en)\" for securing re-election.\n\nIf Joe \"[increase corporate tax](https://taxfoundation.org/joe-biden-tax-plan-2020/)\" Biden wins, the stock market drops to the bottom of the list of Presidential priorities.\n\n# III. $MSFT, $V, and $MA: Robinhood-fueled irrational highs.\n\nFun fact: MSFT is @ an all-time-high. V and MA are nearing their own all-time-highs.\n\nThis quote describes the situation pretty aptly:\n\n&gt;\u201cSwarms of willfully ignorant investors are day-trading their way through the pandemic \u2026 computer algorithms pick up on such trades and pile in to ride the momentum \u2026 in the old days, the little guy mimicked the big boys; right now, it may be the other way around.\"\n\nHere's why I prefer MSFT puts: There's a [90% correlation](https://app.apteo.co/workspaces/2333682638402880697?component=2333953043646645453&amp;utm_source=AppShare&amp;utm_medium=CopyLink&amp;utm_content=ComponentMenuDropdown) between Robinhood MSFT owners and MSFT price.\n\nIn other words, r2 = 0.9 means $MSFT tracks the Robinhood MSFT bandwagon very closely.\n\nWhen the Robinhood masses decide to turn bear, $MSFT will drop hard.\n\nIf you want fries with that, $V and Robinhood V holders has a [correlation coefficient](https://app.apteo.co/workspaces/2333682638402880697?component=2334293385109571140&amp;utm_source=AppShare&amp;utm_medium=CopyLink&amp;utm_content=ComponentMenuDropdown)[ of 0.66](https://app.apteo.co/workspaces/2333682638402880697?component=2334293385109571140&amp;utm_source=AppShare&amp;utm_medium=CopyLink&amp;utm_content=ComponentMenuDropdown) while $MA and Robinhood MA holders has an [r2 of 0.65.](https://app.apteo.co/workspaces/2333682638402880697?component=2334307024256370357&amp;utm_source=AppShare&amp;utm_medium=CopyLink&amp;utm_content=ComponentMenuDropdown)\n\n**TL;DR: Long-dated $MSFT puts (Nov 20 or later).**",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 22nd, 2020.\n\n# **The stock market is running out of steam with reopening trades fading and economic data \u2018uneven\u2019  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/19/the-stock-market-is-running-out-of-steam-with-reopening-trades-fading-and-economic-data-uneven.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to reassure markets next week the central bank will do whatever it takes to help the economy heal. That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; The stock market, so eager to put the entire blow from the pandemic behind it, is now coming to terms that a \u201cV-shaped\u201d recovery might be too rosy a scenario. \n*****\n&gt; With recent spikes in coronavirus cases and fluctuations in the economic data, the market seems to be stuck in a range amid elevated volatility. Market analysts said investors should expect more turbulence ahead because the economic recovery is most likely to be bumpy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market was priced for a continuation of improvement and I think that\u2019s overstating what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said Brian Levitt, Invesco\u2019s global market strategist. \u201cWe are going to have episodes of cases rising. We are going to have a very slow and uneven improvement in the jobs market.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; After soaring more than 40% from the March lows, the S&amp;P 500 turned sideways in the past two weeks, trading at similar levels to early June. The market, which used to turn a blind eye to disastrous news on the thinking that the economy had already bottomed, has become more vulnerable to negative economic headlines as the data begins to give a read on the shape of the recovery.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks came under pressure earlier this week after data showed weekly jobless claims rose more than expected last week, and the number stayed above 1 million for the 13th consecutive week. \n*****\n&gt; And on the virus front, California, Texas, Florida and Arizona have reported an uptick in new infections and hospitalizations amid the reopening. Apple said Friday that it\u2019s again closing some stores in Florida, North Carolina and Arizona due to the spikes in coronavirus cases, which sparked a sell-off in the market, especially among retail stocks.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe economy is going to need more help to bounce back in months to come,\u201d said Matt Miskin, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management. \u201cFor now, volatility and choppy markets remain our base case as an uneven economic recovery likely unfolds.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # \u2018Rolling Ws\u2019\n&gt; The rally in those popular reopening trades \u2014 airlines, cruise lines and hotels \u2014 is seemingly losing steam. Shares of American Airlines and Delta posted their second straight weekly losses. So did Carnival, Norwegian Cruise and MGM Resorts. Those stocks were once the high-beta leaders of the market comeback as investors bet that a successful reopening would take hold. \n*****\n&gt; \u201cAlthough the stock market was suggesting a V-shaped recovery, the more likely scenario is rolling Ws,\u201d Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said in a note.\n*****\n&gt; A similar market pattern happened during the financial crisis, pointed out by Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. After stocks rallied nearly 40% from the 2009 bottom, the market was range-bound for about seven weeks so the fundamentals could catch up, Colas noted.\n*****\n&gt; From a technical perspective, Matthew Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak, is watching if the S&amp;P 500 can break above its recent high of 3,232 or drop below the 3,000 threshold or its 200-day moving average of 3,018 as of Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhichever way it breaks...should be an very important development in trying to determine how this critical juncture in the stock market will be resolved,\u201d Maley said in a note.\n*****\n&gt; # Fed can\u2019t prevent volatility\n&gt; While the flattening virus curve played a big role in the market rebound, it\u2019s no denying that the Federal Reserve\u2019s unprecedented stimulus has been a key driver in lifting stocks from the coronavirus slump. The central bank unleashed another weapon in its arsenal this week, saying it will start buying individual corporate bonds.\n*****\n&gt; As comforting as it is to have the Fed\u2019s support, the central bank can only do so much to ease investor fears.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed can\u2019t prevent the volatility we\u2019re seeing in stocks,\u201d Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest, said in a note. \u201cIt will likely take years for the economy to fully recover and there remain other uncertainties on the path ahead. As such, investors may continue to struggle with this mismatch between markets and the economy before seeing the case for new highs.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell reminded investors again this week in his semiannual testimony before Congress that \u201csignificant uncertainty remains about the timing and strength of the recovery.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Many on Wall Street have also warned that extended policy measures including injection of trillions of cheap money would lead to problems down the road such as hyperinflation.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/bNCgvcfK/finvizmaps2.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/mkTjPTDG/alphatrends61920.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.postimg.cc/pTfkVmPZ/finvizfuts1.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/KYZ2133z/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/3JRjVS09/marketdata1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/SQV7ZFRJ/spxsectors1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/QMkWH1WH/marketpullbacklevels1.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/xCfNH8Kg/marketrallylevels1.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/3w88YJPH/ercal1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/Dzzn76x5/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/XqFWYcpP/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/C19Y06LD/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# 100 Days\n\n&gt; 100 days ago today on March 11th, the WHO made it official and declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. Markets were already under a lot of pressure before the WHO declared the pandemic, but the 100 days since will probably go down as some of the craziest 100 days we'll ever experience, not only in the market but in general society as well. More than enough ink and pixels have been spent discussing the societal impact at large, so we'll spare you and just focus on the markets.\n\n&gt; While much of the declines were already in the rearview mirror by the time the WHO made its announcement, equities still had a steep decline in the immediate aftermath. The large-cap Russell 1000, for example, fell another 19% to its March 23rd closing low, but after the rebound, the net change since the pandemic was officially declared &gt; has been a gain of 14.3%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/061920-Russell-1000.png))**\n\n&gt; As impressive as the Russell 1000's gain has been in the face of the global pandemic, many stocks have done a lot better than that. The table below lists the 25 stocks in the index that have seen the biggest gains so far during this pandemic. Topping the list is Wayfair (W) which has rallied more than 350%. If there is one thing Americans must have realized while they were stuck at home under lockdown it was that they needed some new furniture! Behind Wayfair, two other stocks have more than tripled and both were beaten down stocks from the Energy sector that were trading at less than $2 per share on March 11th. A number of familiar names standout including Moderna (MRNA), Twilio (TWLO), DocuSign (DOCU), Beyond Meat (BYND), and Etsy (ETSY), but looking through the list, there's really a diverse group of names ranging from bombed-out stocks from the Energy sector (8 stocks), Consumer names (7 stocks), and the ever-popular software stocks from the Technology sector (6 stocks). It's definitely been a rocky road for the markets over the last 100 days, but for anyone who had these names in their portfolio, they aren't complaining.

Relative to their 50-DMAs, all 24 S&amp;P 500 industry groups still have rising 50-DMAs. When you consider the fact that the 50-day window spans the period going back to early April, a period encompassing most of what was one of the strongest 50-day rallies on record, the fact that every industry group has a rising 50-DMA isn't all that surprising.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/061920-Rising-50DMA.png))**\n\n&gt; Even though all their 50-DMAs are rising, not every industry group is currently trading above its 50-DMA. While the reading briefly reached 100% in late May and early June, two industry groups have since pulled back below their 50-DMAs, putting the percentage at a still impressive 91.7%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/061920-Above-50-DMA.png))**\n\n&gt; The table below summarizes industry group performance showing YTD performance, where each one is trading relative to its 50-DMA, as well as where the group is trading relative to its 52-week high.\n\n&gt; As mentioned above, all but two groups (Drugs &amp; Biotech and Food &amp; Staples Retail) remain above their 50-DMAs, and another four are less than 2% above their 50-DMA. If Friday's sell-off deepens into next week, the percentage of industry groups above their 50-DMAs has the potential to quickly sink as low as 75%. Of the 22 industry groups that are above their 50-DMAs, Autos and Tech Hardware are the only two greater than 10% above.\n\n&gt; On a YTD basis, the S&amp;P 500 is down less than 4%, but for the vast majority of industry groups, performance has been worse than that. Of the 24 groups shown, 16 are down more than 4% YTD, including eleven that are down over 10%. The worst performers of these losers include Energy, Banks, and Autos. While Energy gets most of the attention for being so weak, Banks are essentially down just as much! On the upside, just two industry groups are up over 10% (Retailers, which is basically Amazon, and Software &amp; Services). Retailing is also the one industry group that is within 1% of a 52-week high and one of seven that is within 4% of a 52-week high.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/061920-Groups-vs-50-DMA.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Credit Market Reversals\n\n&gt; We've noted in detail the massive reversals seen in global equities over the last three months, but outside of equities, we've also seen some other massive moves. One example is credit spreads between the yields of corporate and high yield bonds relative to Treasuries.\n\n&gt; The top chart below shows the spread in yields between the B of A Corporate Index relative to Treasuries going back to 1997, and below that, we show the 50-day rate of change in the spread. Heading into the COVID-crash, spreads on corporate bonds were less than 100 basis points (bps), meaning the corporate bond index was yielding only 1 percentage point more than comparable Treasury yields. In the span of less than two months, though, spreads surged by more than 300 bps to over 400 bps. Not since the depths of the credit crisis in 2009 had we seen spreads widen out more than they did in March. Just as notable as the level is the fact that the speed with which spreads widened during the COVID-crash was similar to the pace during the credit crisis.\n\n&gt; While spreads were quick to spike during both crises, they narrowed nearly as fast both times. Going back to 1997, the most corporate spreads have ever narrowed over a 50-day period was in June 2009. Coming in at a close second place, though, the 50-day period ending in early June was nearly as extreme.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/061820-Corporates.png))**\n\n&gt; Similar to spreads on corporate bonds, the movement in spreads on high yield (junk) credit has been nearly as extreme. While spreads on the B of A High Yield Master Index widened out by only half as much during the COVID-crash as they did during the Financial Crisis, the 50-day move ending in late March was easily more extreme than any other period outside of the credit crisis.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/061820-High-Yield.png))**\n\n&gt; A shown in both charts above, the only time both corporate and high yield spreads narrowed by an amount anywhere close to the amount they narrowed from late March through early June was back in early June of 2009. The chart below of the S&amp;P 500 shows that point from the perspective of the S&amp;P 500. That period in June 2009 was right in the early stages of what turned out to be a multi-year bull market. Given the similar tightening in the credit market now versus back then, should we assume a similar move for equities going forward?\n\n&gt; After the last five months, we'll be the first to say that anything is possible. However, while there are plenty of similarities between the moves in credit markets over the last three months versus the first half of 2009, there are also important distinctions. The most important of these has to do with where the S&amp;P 500 is trading right now. The second chart below shows the historical levels the S&amp;P 500 has traded at relative to its all-time high. Even after the initial narrowing of credit spreads from March through early June 2009, the S&amp;P 500 was still more than 40% off its all-time highs, and therefore still had a lot of climbing to do to get out of the hole. Back in June 2009, to get back to its all-time high from October 2007, the S&amp;P 500 still had to rally another 75%. Today, it's a much different picture as the S&amp;P 500 is already within 10% of its February 2020 all-time high. Could we be in the earlier stages of what turns out to be another long-term bull market? Sure. Will the magnitude of the gains be anything like the gains early on in the bull market that began in 2009? It's unlikely.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/061820-SP500.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Very Slow Recovery In Economic Activity Is Continuing\n\n&gt; As economies around the country slowly recover from COVID-19 and reopenings proceed, economic activity is slowly recovering. For the hardest-hit sectors, though, the recovery is only inching forward. Security checkpoint volumes at US airports are still down 80% YoY, and the trend of improvement is only set to return travel activity to 50% of 2019 levels in September.\n\n&gt; For restaurants, OpenTable data shows covers down by two-thirds from last year, though some of that is because many restaurants remain closed. Among reopened establishments, the number of seated customers are still down almost 40% YoY. About half of restaurants remain closed per the OpenTable data. We discussed this chart and other retail enthusiasm indicators in last night's Closer report, which is available to Bespoke Institutional members.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/061720-High-Frequencyt.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Leading Indicators Turn Positive\n\n&gt; Yesterday, The Conference Board released last month\u2019s reading for its Leading Economic Index (LEI), a composite of leading data series, which showed a month-over-month increase of 2.8%. As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, the return to positive territory follows three straight months of negative monthly growth.\n\n&gt; \u201dWe noted that the pace of the LEI\u2019s deterioration slowed in the April report, potentially suggesting a bottom forming in the US economy,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cYesterday\u2019s print was one of several positive economic data surprises we\u2019ve observed recently, bolstering our optimistic view for economic growth in the second half of the year.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.19.20-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; While the economy still has a ways to go in order to recover from the damage of the prior three months, the composition of May\u2019s LEI advance encourages us. We noted a disconnect in April\u2019s readout in which the financial market indicators tended to be net positive contributors while the \u201creal economy\u201d indicators detracted. May\u2019s release saw a reversal of that trend whereby the economic subindexes played catch-up. Seven of the 10 components were positive contributors led by an improvement in average weekly initial unemployment claims, average weekly manufacturing hours, and building permits. The three negative contributors were the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) New Orders Index, average consumer expectations for business conditions, and the Leading Credit Index.\n\n&gt; The most recent LEI release reinforces our view that an economic bottom is likely behind us. Workers starting to return to jobs that they were unable to do remotely had material effects on May\u2019s readout, and if that trend continues, a stock market trading at stretched valuations would have a stronger foundation under it.\n\n*****\n\n# 3 Charts That Have Our Attention\n\n&gt; Stocks have shaken off the 5.9% S&amp;P 500 Index drop last Thursday by gaining three days in a row before yesterday\u2019s modest weakness. While researching and reading this week, three charts stood out that tell us quite a good deal about how investors have reacted during this volatile market and what could be next.\n\n&gt; \u201cIncredibly, we saw nearly a third of all investors over 65 years old sell their full equity holdings,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWith stocks now back near highs, this is yet another reason to have a plan in place before trouble comes, as making decisions when under duress can lead to the exact wrong decision.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, according to data from Fidelity Investments, nearly 18% of all investors sold their full equity holdings between February and May, while a much higher percentage that were closer to retirement (or in retirement) sold. Some might have bought back in, but odds are that many are feeling quite upset with the record bounce back in stocks here.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.18.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Along these same lines, investors have recently moved to cash at a record pace. In fact, there is now nearly $5 trillion in money market funds, almost twice the levels we saw this time only five years ago. Also, the past three months saw the largest three-month change ever, as investors ran to the safety of cash. If you were looking for a reason stocks could continue to go higher over the longer term, there really is a lot of cash on the sidelines right now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.18.20-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Last, we noted last week that the extreme overbought nature of stocks here is actually consistent with the start of a new bull run, not a bear market bounce, or the end of a bull market. Adding to this, the spread between the number of stocks above their 50-day moving average and 200-day moving average was near the highest level ever. Think about it; with the 45% bounce in the S&amp;P 500, many stocks were above their 50-day moving average, but not nearly as many were above their 200-day moving average. So from a longer-term perspective, there could still be gains to be had.\n\n&gt; Sure enough, looking at other times that had wide spreads, they took place near the start of major bull markets. Near-term the potential is there for a well-deserved pullback, but going out 6 to 12 months, stocks have consistently outperformed.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.18.20-blog-chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Election Year July Performance Tepid\n\n&gt; July historically is the best performing month of the third quarter however, the mostly negative results in August and September tend to make the comparison easy. Two \u201chot\u201d Julys in 2009 and 2010 where DJIA and S&amp;P 500 both gained greater than 6% and a strong performance in 2013 and 2018 have boosted July\u2019s average gains since 1950 to 1.2% and 1.1% respectively. Such strength inevitability stirs talk of a \u201csummer rally\u201d, but beware the hype, as it has historically been the weakest rally of all seasons (page 74, Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac 2020).\n\n&gt; July begins NASDAQ\u2019s worst four months and is the third weakest performing NASDAQ month since 1971, posting a 0.5% average gain. Dynamic trading often accompanies the first full month of summer as the beginning of the second half of the year brings an inflow of new capital. This creates a bullish beginning, a soft week after options expiration and some strength towards the end.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f885bb39aabd998cfc1457d4a0cbfb36/6b8e9304ec3e7ef8-8a/s400x600/ea91fed87507aed1f64cc4ae460a0006a0a987a5.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Election year Julys rank in the bottom half of all election year months. DJIA: 0.5%, 6th worst; S&amp;P 0.4% 6th worst; NASDAQ (since 1972): -0.7% 3rd worst; Russell 2000 (since 1980): -0.2% 3rd worst.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.18.20-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NKE** \n&gt; * **$RAD** \n&gt; * **$DRI** \n&gt; * **$WGO** \n&gt; * **$MKC** \n&gt; * **$WTI** \n&gt; * **$INFO** \n&gt; * **$ACN** \n&gt; * **$KBH** \n&gt; * **$SOHO** \n&gt; * **$FDS** \n&gt; * **$BB** \n&gt; * **$AVAV** \n&gt; * **$LZB** \n&gt; * **$XAIR** \n&gt; * **$CAAS** \n&gt; * **$MCF** \n&gt; * **$BWAY** \n&gt; * **$SNX** \n&gt; * **$GMS** \n&gt; * **$WOR** \n&gt; * **$QMCO** \n&gt; * **$AFMD** \n&gt; * **$EPAC** \n&gt; * **$WUBA** \n&gt; * **$USAT** \n&gt; * **$NG** \n&gt; * **$PDCO** \n&gt; * **$APOG** \n&gt; * **$PRGS** \n&gt; * **$FUL** \n&gt; * **$AEMD** \n&gt; * **$AIH** \n&gt; * **$YRD** \n&gt; * **$STAF** \n&gt; * **$UFAB** \n&gt; * **$CAMP**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/3w88YJPH/ercal1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/Bvmq6f0P/ervol1.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.22.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.22.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oRk1EWr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.23.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/o3y0OMu.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/LnfpSm3.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.24.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Fo1uuw1.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/IUlzLOq.pngg))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.25.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ygKaF2x.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.25.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PlIFXwS.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.26.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/U4g7nNG.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.26.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Nike Inc $95.78\n&gt; **Nike Inc (NKE)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:15 PM ET on Thursday, June 25, 2020.

This wouldn't be alarming if the majority of their losses weren't coming from increased wages/salaries, which they cannot afford at the moment. \n\nIn post COVID-19 with producers slumping as we enter the summer, I don't see how distribution companies can be profitable for the next year, let alone survive the market correction ahead.",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 8th, 2020.\n\n# **Look for the S&amp;P 500 to turn positive for the year with a boost from the Fed in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/05/look-for-the-sp-500-to-turn-positive-for-the-year-with-a-boost-from-the-fed-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to reassure markets next week the central bank will do whatever it takes to help the economy heal. That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting is the big event for markets in the coming week. There are a few economic reports, including inflation data, the consumer price index Wednesday and producer prices Thursday. Weekly jobless claims will be important Thursday to see if there\u2019s a drop in continuing clams, after May\u2019s employment report showed a surprising record gain of 2.5 million jobs.\n*****\n&gt; The reopening trade was in full swing in the past week, especially Friday when stocks surged on the jobs report, which was expected to show a loss of 8.3 million jobs. The Nasdaq broke above its record high set on Feb. 19, and the S&amp;P 500 was just 1.1% away from turning positive for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Even before the jobs report, investors were loading up on financials, industrials, transports and small caps, which were up more than 8% for the week and 18.4% in the past month. S&amp;P financials were 12.1% higher on the week, S&amp;P industrials were up 10.5, and the NYSE airline index jumped more than 35.4.%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think next week is dominated by the reopening and it will be for another month,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. \u201cWith cyclicals outperforming, small [caps] outperforming, credit spreads coming in and then the bond yields going up, everybody \u2014 all facets of the financial markets \u2014 are sort of suggesting the same outcome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 3,193, a gain of 4.9%, and now traders are watching to see if it can scale the psychological 3,200 level. The Dow closed Friday at 27,110, up 6.8% for the week, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.4%, at 9,814 after reaching an intraday record high of 9,845 Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts say the market will likely look past the protests that broke out in cities across the U.S. after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Four policemen were charged with murder in his death. Looters joined the protests, some of which turned violent, but they quieted down towards the end of the week.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher for a third week in a row, but a change this past week has been the abrupt lurch higher in Treasury yields. The 10-year rose to a high of 0.95% Friday, a quarter-point move in just three sessions. The move was already underway but got a lift Wednesday when ADP jobs data was not nearly as bad as expected. Yields ripped even higher after the May employment report showed the unemployment rate actually fell to 13.3%, instead of climbing to 20%, as expected by economists.\n*****\n&gt; Bond strategists said the Treasury market was now acknowledging the potential for a recovery, but not in the exuberant way the stock market has been. Since March 23, the S&amp;P 500 has risen more than 45%, but it took the 10-year Treasury until this week to get back the yield level it was at when stocks bottomed.\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen said he believes a new bull market has been launched, but there could be pullbacks and some headwinds for the market coming up.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhen GDP is minus 30%, other issues don\u2019t matter. There\u2019s just one issue. But as the economy reopens again, the trade battles will matter again, presidential politics will matter again,\u201d said Paulsen, adding the budget deficit could also matter. \u201cI think we\u2019ll get removed from a sole focus. That isn\u2019t quite there but I think it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed begins its two-day meeting Tuesday, and will release its statement Wednesday afternoon, followed by a video briefing by Powell.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhey would the Fed want to disrupt this with anything?\u201d Paulsen said. \u201cThey\u2019re still going to support the economy. They\u2019re going to stay away from negative rates or yield curve management. They\u2019re not going to do anything to scare the markets. They might certainly reassure people that they are still ready to provide support.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America, said the Fed may clarify where it stands on some of the extraordinary moves it has taken since it cut rates to zero. The Fed has been supporting the markets with asset purchases and multiple programs for commercial paper, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds, for example.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe think right now they\u2019re just trying to get this Main Street lending program to work. The question is are they going to do more things around what they do in terms of forward guidance and next steps of macro easing,\u201d Harris said.\n*****\n&gt; There has been speculation that the Fed would do some type of so-called yield curve control, a program to keep interest rates capped at certain levels. \u201cI think it\u2019s too early for that,\u201d said Harris. He said the Fed would be guaranteeing low rates for a long period of time if it does yield curve control.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYield curve control is basically open-ended quantitative easing,\u201d he said. The Fed is currently buying Treasurys but if it wanted to stop yields from rising too much as the economy improves, it could make targeted purchases.\n*****\n&gt; Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said it\u2019s possible the Fed could announce the yield curve control. \u201cWe\u2019ve said they could implement yield curve control out to three years,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my mind that matches the length of the horizon of the economic projections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Powell has said the economy needs more fiscal help, and he could reiterate those comments Wednesday. President Donald Trump on Friday said he backs more stimulus. So far, the Democrats have put out a marker with their wish list for further spending, but there have been no negotiations.\n*****\n&gt; There was concern the strong jobs report could make it harder to get buy in for another big spending package. But some economists say the recovery needs a boost and states need funding to fill the holes in their budgets from coronavirus-related spending and a lack of tax receipts.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7klaXQm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PKTBzT2.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/a5JkAB6.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/M2x4Qoq.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qtJYfXN.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bjiJWjV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UAi19KJ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GQm4ruO.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uV1U7FN.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/wm2XJND.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yarkiMO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hFblu2G.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Stocks Outpacing Analyst Price Targets\n\n&gt; This morning's jobs report shocked the financial world -- most notably the economists whose job it is to provide estimates. The consensus estimate among economists for May nonfarm payrolls was projecting a loss of more than 7 million jobs. The actual number that was reported did not just show a smaller than expected job loss, but it actually showed a gain in jobs of more than 2.5 million.\n\n&gt; We're seeing a similar situation play out in the equity analyst community. With the S&amp;P 500 now up 40%+ since its low less than three months ago, the average stock in the index is now trading above its consensus analyst price target that looks 12 months out. Analysts have simply not been able to catch up to the rapid rise we've seen for equity prices.\n\n&gt; It's extremely rare to see share prices move above consensus analyst price targets. We don't have the historical daily data on this, but anecdotally we can't remember a time when the spread has been this wide. As shown below, at the end of 2019 when the S&amp;P finished a massive rally, equity prices were 5.5% below the consensus price target. That was seen as a very tight spread prior to what we're seeing now. At the lows in March, the average share price had dropped all the way to $92.50 compared to an average consensus price target of $143.20. That projected a gain of 54.9% at the time!\n\n&gt; Since March 23rd, the average share price has risen from $92.50 up to $138.40, while the average analyst price target has fallen from $143.20 to $136. Current price targets no longer project a gain for the average S&amp;P 500 stock, but rather a 1.7% drop.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/avgpricetarget.png))**\n\n&gt; # Nasdaq's Historical Run\n\n&gt; At its highs earlier this morning, the Nasdaq Composite was within 2% of its record high from earlier in the year. Besides the steep V-shape of the Nasdaq's pattern over the last four months, the other aspect of the chart that stands out is just how steep the 50-day moving average is trending lately.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-50DMAa.png))**\n\n&gt; To illustrate just how steep the Nasdaq's 50-DMA has become, the chart below shows the daily percentage change of the 50-day going back to 1971. Currently, the Nasdaq 50-DMA is rising at an average of over 0.5% per day. That's an incredible slope and a level that has been exceeded only a handful of times in the Nasdaq's 50-year history.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-Composite1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Big Gains From Smaller Tech\n\n&gt; It's still difficult to fathom the moves in the US equity market over the last four months. The fact that the Nasdaq and more specifically the Technology sector aren't far from record highs is definitely something no one was expecting two months ago. There's an old market saying that equities take the stairs up and the elevator down, but in the latest market cycle, the elevator up was almost as fast as the way down!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Nasdaq.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Technology-Sector.png))**\n\n&gt; If you've been following the markets, all you've likely heard up until recently is that large-cap tech, and more specifically, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Facebook (FB), are single-handedly driving the market higher. The reality is not nearly as clear-cut. Given their market caps, the \"Big 5\" (as they're often referred to) have done a lot of heavy lifting, but in terms of performance, they're hardly the only game in town.\n\n&gt; The table below lists Technology sector stocks in the Russell 3000 with market caps of more than $1 billion that are outperforming all of the 'big 5' tech stocks on a YTD basis. Actually, since Amazon is doing so well relative to the rest of the \"big 5\" these are all stocks that are outperforming Amazon. If we looked for stocks that were doing better than the average return of the \"big 5\" the list would be a lot, lot longer (+16.4%).\n\n&gt; Looking through the list of names below, the two top-performing names are Zscaler (ZS) and Twilio (TWLO), which have both more than doubled. Behind these two, DocuSign (DOCU) and Sprout Social (SPT) are both knocking on the door of triple-digits. All 28 of the names listed have market caps of $1 billion, but the average market cap is just over $21 billion, while Nvidia (NVDA) is the largest company on the list with a market cap of $216 billion. For the most part, these aren't names that have been driving the indices, but anyone holding these stocks in their portfolio probably doesn't care!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Tech-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Best 50-Day Rally Ever\n\n&gt; In many ways, what we\u2019ve seen so far in 2020 has been both record-breaking and devastating. From the S&amp;P 500 Index peak on February 19 to the bear market lows March 23, stocks lost 33.9%. Now, 50 trading days later, stocks have gained 39.6%, for the largest 50-day rally since the S&amp;P 500 moved to 500 stocks in 1957.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere are no rollercoasters that can replicate what stocks have done so far in 2020,\u201d exclaimed LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHere\u2019s the catch though: Big 50-day rallies in the past have taken place near the start of new bull markets, and the returns going out a year were quite bullish.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 39.6% gain in 50 days was the greatest 50-day rally ever, besting the previous best in October 1982. What\u2019s important to note here is that many of these rallies took place coming off major market lows, and delivered quite strong returns going out 6 to 12 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/best-fifty-days.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Although we have near-term worries given this historic run, as some sentiment indicators such as put/call ratios are showing some froth, from a bigger picture perspective, this strong 50-day rally offers a reason to think stock prices may be even higher this time next year.\n\n*****\n\n# 2020 In Charts\n\n&gt; 2020 is only five months old, but in many ways it is one of the most historic years we\u2019ve ever seen. \u201c2020 went from moving along nicely, to seeing the worst recession in a generation and the fastest bear market ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cNow stocks are in the midst of one of the best bull runs ever, even though the economy remains extremely weak, thanks to record stimulus and hopes over a vaccine.\u201d\n&gt; \nTo best sum it all up, here are 10 charts that tell the picture of 2020 so far.\n\n&gt; 1.) The 2010s were the first decade in history to go all 10 years without a recession, which of course ended just months into the new decade, as the economy stopped. Stocks gained 13.5% on an annual basis last decade, surprisingly, only the third-best decade over the past four.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 2.) This is an election year, and the S&amp;P 500 Index hasn\u2019t been lower when a President is up for reelection since FDR in 1940. Although this seemed nearly impossible at the March lows, it is looking like this incredible streak could have a chance in 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 3.) One of the first signs something could go wrong in 2020 was stocks fell in January. Historically, this has meant potential trouble for the final 11 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 4.) As fears over COVID-19 gripped the world, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its fastest bear market ever, in only 19 days. To put this in perspective, this was the fastest bear market in the 124-year history of the Dow.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 5.) Mark Twain said \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes\u201d. Looking at history, every 50 years there has been a terrible pandemic and stocks fell more than 30%. We don\u2019t know if the ultimate lows are in this time, but so far, history is rhyming.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 6.) More than 20 million people in the US lost their jobs in April, while the unemployment rate soared to near 15%, the highest since the Great Depression. Record drops in manufacturing, industrial production, retail sales, and consumer spending have all taken place in the past two months as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 7.) A recession is here, ending the streak of 128 months in a row without one. What is unique about the previous expansion was nominal gross domestic product (GDP) grew only 50%, about the average growth seen during the previous expansions, but this expansion was nearly twice as long as the average expansion (10 years versus 5 years).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 8.) The bounce off of the March 23 S&amp;P 500 lows has been historic in many ways. In fact, it was one of the best 20-day rallies ever, with previous best rallies seeing strong returns 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 9.) As scary as it was on the way down, stocks have come roaring back, gaining more than 35% from the March 23 lows. This would classify as the greatest bear market bounce ever, which opens the question: is this more than a bear market bounce and instead the start of a new bull market?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 10.) The number of COVID-19 tests in the US nearly doubled in May versus what was seen in April. Additionally, fewer and fewer tests are coming back positive. Testing is one of the key ways we will beat this and this is a step in the right direction. We\u2019ve also seen new monthly lows in people on ventilators, in the ICU, and in hospitals.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Hard to believe, but there are still 7 months left in 2020. It hasn\u2019t been easy for any of us, and we continue to keep everyone impacted by this pandemic in mind, but we continue to see the glass as half full. The dual benefit of record monetary and fiscal policy should help create a bridge to help those most impacted, while the economy can slowly come back online later this year.\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$ADBE** \n&gt; * **$UNFI** \n&gt; * **$CHWY** \n&gt; * **$TIF** \n&gt; * **$LULU** \n&gt; * **$COUP** \n&gt; * **$SFIX** \n&gt; * **$LOVE** \n&gt; * **$NEPT** \n&gt; * **$GHM** \n&gt; * **$REVG** \n&gt; * **$GME** \n&gt; * **$HDS** \n&gt; * **$FIVE** \n&gt; * **$SIG** \n&gt; * **$CASY** \n&gt; * **$CVGW** \n&gt; * **$AMC** \n&gt; * **$FCEL** \n&gt; * **$QTNT** \n&gt; * **$PLCE** \n&gt; * **$CHS** \n&gt; * **$THO** \n&gt; * **$GCO** \n&gt; * **$BF.B** \n&gt; * **$LMNR** \n&gt; * **$WSG** \n&gt; * **$PRTY** \n&gt; * **$GES** \n&gt; * **$BBCP** \n&gt; * **$CONN** \n&gt; * **$HEXO** \n&gt; * **$PHR** \n&gt; * **$PVH** \n&gt; * **$RRGB** \n&gt; * **$PLAY** \n&gt; * **$TNP** \n&gt; * **$JW.A** \n&gt; * **$SB** \n&gt; * **$GSM** \n&gt; * **$SRT**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/bgPdMCr.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.8.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/d2EW1kr.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uxSiJJr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.9.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3SIjcG7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cRBrPlt.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.10.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DaheXAm.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9mcHxTl.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.11.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/i8SNjWM.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9xcBZPK.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.12.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Inc. $392.90\n&gt; **Adobe Inc.

        "selftext": "In this week's edition of DDDD (Data-Driven DD), we'll be exploring the most common way that investors calculate what a stock's actually worth, and then why this valuation method no longer anymore. Also, apparently mods disabled image uploads, so this post is going to be a bit hard to read since I rely a lot on visuals in them; please direct all your complaints to them.\n\n  \n*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so; look at what happened to all the SPY 220p 4/17 bag holders. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*\n\n# The Discounted Cash Flow Model\n\nThe DCF model is the most common model for valuing companies in finance, and hence the fair value of a stock. It\u2019s based on one simple principle: the value of a company is based on the ability of that company to generate cash flows in the future. This principle is used in virtually every other financial instruments, like bonds, and is also used to help aid capital expenditure decisions. This method of valuing a company became popular after the 1929 stock market crash, once the \u201cstonks\u00a0only go up\u201d mentality broke and investors started investing in equities based on value and returns rather than speculation, which drove much of the stock market in the 1920s, but this idea has been used as far back as ancient Egypt.\n\n**Time Value of Money**\n\nBefore looking into the math behind the DCF model, another principle needs to be understood - Time Value of Money. This is the principle that money today, or the Present Value, is worth more than money in the future, or Future Value. The difference in worth can be caused by many things, such as inflation, the interest rate of Treasuries (i.e. risk free rate), and risk of default. This difference of worth is calculated to some interest rate, r, which is then used to calculate the Present Value of some future cash flow.\n\n[Time Value of Money Formula](https://imgur.com/a/1DGJMFj)\n\n**Cost of Capital**\n\nIn the case of valuing a company, what would this rate be? Typically, the Weighted Average Cost of Capital, or WACC is used for this percentage.\n\n[WACC Formula](https://imgur.com/a/pBwR0xB)\n\nWACC in simple terms is the rate of return typically required to be paid by the company to shareholders and bondholders to raise capital from them. In this formula,\n\n*E is the market capitalization of all equity in the company*\n\n*D is the value of all debt in the company*\n\n*V = E+D*\n\n*Tc is the tax rate paid by the company*\n\n*Rd is the cost of debt, for simplicity let\u2019s say this is the average interest rate paid by the company for its outstanding debts*\n\n*Re is the cost of equity. The most common way of calculating this is the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), with the formula below*\n\n[Cost of Equity Formula](https://imgur.com/a/l8hRXa4)\n\nIn this formula,\n\nRf is the risk free rate, which is the interest rate an investor can receive when investing in some risk free asset, like a US treasury\n\n\u03b2 represents the volatility of a company\u2019s stock on the stock market; this value has its own complicated formula but this value can be usually found in most stock trading platforms\n\nRm is the long-term return of equity markets. Hence (Rm - Rf) is typically seen as the equity risk premium, which is the excess returns given by the stock market for taking on the risk of investing in equities rather than treasuries\n\n**Free Cash Flow**\n\nFree cash flow is typically reported as part of a public company\u2019s financial statements and hence can easily be discovered. Intuitively, it\u2019s the company\u2019s ability to generate cash from operations to pay back stock and bond holders, and is calculated by adding non-cash expenses (i.e. depreciation, amortization), subtracting capital expenditures, and adding increases in current assets - liabilities to the post-tax EBIT, or Earnings before Interest and Taxes.\n\n**Putting it all together**\n\n[Enterprise Value Formula](https://imgur.com/a/IXoFalW)\n\nWith all of these in mind, let\u2019s use them to calculate the Enterprise Value of a company. This is done by adding the sums of all future cash flows generated by the company, and discounting it by the weighted average cost of capital. Since a company can have a potentially perpetual stream of cash flows, and future cash flows beyond a few years becomes very unpredictable, we would instead only do this calculation for the first five years, and then add some \u201cTerminal Value\u201d of the company to represent how much the company would be worth by the end of that period, and discount that as well.\n\n[Terminal Value Formula](https://imgur.com/a/3dfSLS9)\n\nTo calculate this Terminal Value, we\u2019ll need to have some rate, g, which represents the \u201cgrowth rate\u201d of the company once it\u2019s mature and no longer growing rapidly (i.e. taking market share).\n\nOnce you add all of the discounted near-term cash flows and discounted Terminal Value, you now have the Enterprise Value. Once you have that, figuring out the fair value of all the equity in a company, or the market cap, is easy.\n\n**Fair Market Cap = Enterprise Value - Total Debt + Cash**\n\n# Where we are right now\n\nLet\u2019s see how recent events have changed the equation for equity valuations today compared to in January for the stock market overall.\n\n**Cost of Equity**\n\nRisk Free Rate - Looking at US Treasuries, this is this most obvious and well-known change in this equation, with yields plummeting from 1.5% from the start of the year to near 0% today.\n\n[Risk Free Rate Graph](https://imgur.com/a/LLcMoDC)\n\nMarket Risk Premium - This one is a bit complicated because it can\u2019t really be immediately calculated and is based largely on investor sentiment. Historically, market risk premium has been between 5% to 6% for the US stock market. This can easily change, however, based on economic and financial conditions. Right now, let\u2019s assume this has remained unchanged, but we\u2019ll get back to this later.\n\n**Cost of Capital**\n\nDebt - Corporate debt this year has exploded, with an [additional $1 Trillion raised by companies](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/29/corporations-raise-1-trillion-in-the-bond-market-after-fed-backstop-double-the-pace-of-last-year.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1591575861873000)\u00a0so far, more than double from last year at the same time of the year\n\nEquity - SPY started at this year at $325; As of time of writing, it\u2019s within 2% of this number\n\nCost of Debt - Despite skyrocketing bond yields in March as the economy experienced a liquidity crisis, bond yields have since stabilized, aided by the Fed backstop, and bonds yields are now at about the same levels as it was at the start of the year.\n\n[Bond Yields](https://imgur.com/a/wFITrco)\n\nSo assuming the risk premium being the same, compared to the start of the year, we have a slightly lower cost of equity from a lower risk free rate, roughly the same cost of debt, and having increased corporate debt, making the debt weigh more proportionally than before in our WACC. Since the cost of debt is usually slightly lower than the cost of equity, this provides a slight downwards pressure towards WACC as well. Thus, WACC has decreased by a small amount since January, due to increased debt levels and decreased risk free rates.\n\n**Free Cash Flow**\n\nFor most non-tech companies, the lockdown has severely hurt their cash flows, with many industries such as airlines burning billions of dollars per month. It\u2019s pretty hard to find up-to-date metrics of what free cash flow is for the S&amp;P500, so instead, I\u2019ll just use earnings as a proxy to make a very rough estimate of what it might look like. According to [one source](https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_051520.pdf) I found, Q1 saw the YoY decline of 14.6%, with an estimated 36% decline in earnings for Q2.\n\nWhat free cash flow looks like for the remainder of the year, and future years depends on two very fundamental questions.\n\nFirst, will there be a second wave of lockdowns later in the year? On one side of this, based on the history of similar pandemics and what most medical experts are saying, a second spike of cases is extremely likely to occur in the fall. On the other hand, the US population seemed to have stopped caring about the virus, and is currently distracted by other problems. It\u2019s unclear whether or not the US population will care enough to lock down the country once again when the second wave hits after being desensitized with the first wave. In fact the first wave never really stopped; the US just started pretending that the pandemic is over and it\u2019s time to go back to business as usual.\n\n[US Daily Cases](https://imgur.com/a/iVirLQ4)\n\n[Daily Cases for Italy; What \"flatten the curve\" actually looks like](https://imgur.com/a/fhaz2IR) \n\nThe second question, assuming the answer to the first question is \u201cNo\u201d, is what kind of recovery the US economy will see. According to [one source](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://conference-board.org/publications/Economic-Forecast-US&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1591575861874000), \u00a0\u201cV\u201d-shaped recovery will see earnings going back to normal as early as 2021. A \u201cU\u201d-shaped recovery, which will represent a recession, could see it take up until 2022 to return back to pre-COVID output levels. If we do see a second wave of lockdowns, then what might be seen is a \u201cW\u201d-shaped recovery, where we\u2019ll see a second steep decline in GDP, and prolong the recession and make it tougher to get towards a recovery as more businesses go bankrupt.\n\n[GDP Projections](https://imgur.com/a/jK78km1)\n\nMissing from this model is an \u201cL\u201d-shaped recovery, similar to what happened in Japan in the 1990s, and the US in the 1930s, which would represent a decade-long depression. This is what I personally believe would look like in [my long-term thesis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gqgwfg/dddd_cycles_and_human_history/), along with some of the most famous investors in the financial world, [like Ray Dalio](https://www.principles.com/the-changing-world-order/).\n\nBack to the DCF Model; we have an additional $1 Trillion of corporate debt. With a total market cap of $32 Trillion, the effect of this on the fair value of equities are negligible. With nearly the same market cap as in the beginning of the year, this would mean the market is pricing in the same Enterprise Value for the market as the start of the year. This implies either one of two things, based on the factors explained about\n\n1. The stock market has priced in a \u201cV\u201d-shaped recovery for earnings, with earnings and free cash flow beyond 2020 to remain unimpaired.\n2. The stock market has priced in a \u201cU\u201d-shaped recovery, but this is offset by a lower WACC as the market risk premium has significantly lowered. This can be caused by a few things, such as decreased perceived risk by investors of companies due to fiscal and monetary stimulus, and inflows of cash that was previously waiting in the sidelines (eg. retail investors), large international funds (eg. Saudi and Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth funds), and yield-seeking institutions as Treasury yields drop to 0%, with no prospect of a rate increase anytime soon.\n\n**Why Fundamentals Might Not Matter Anymore**\n\nThere\u2019s another thing that can explain the recent stock market movements other the reasons explained above of what the stock market was pricing in - a stock market bubble. This happens when speculation in the market overpowers fundamentals, and the money in the market is no longer investing for long-term, earnings-based gains, but rather trying to get short-term gains through speculation. In other words people throwing their money in the stock market aren\u2019t investing because they legitimately think the company has good fundamentals and will give a good return on their investment through earnings in the long term, but because they believe that stocks only go up, and hence they can make a quick buck by throwing some money in it and cashing out later and making money through capital gains. This is how every asset bubble starts, from the Dutch tulip-mania bubble, the English South Sea bubble, the 1920s stock market bubble, the dot com stock market bubble, and the real estate bubble in the 2000s.\n\nTo give an example to illustrate what\u2019s happening, let\u2019s look at one of the first major bankruptcies to have happened during the stock market crash - Whiting Petroleum (WLL). I\u2019ve previously covered WLL, but the most interesting part of it is the dislocation of the valuation of its stock and bonds.\n\nWLL [reached a bankruptcy agreement](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1255474/000119312520118310/d922194dex10.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1591575861876000)\u00a0with some of its key creditors on April 23. To be clear, this agreement has not been agreed upon with all its creditors and has yet to be approved by the court, and represents the best-case outcome for existing WLL shareholders; the court or creditors and reject this and demand better terms, or even worse, request to change the bankruptcy to a Chapter 7 and liquidate all the assets. The agreement was to restructure the corporation such that the bondholder will receive 97% of the restructured company\u2019s equity, and the remaining 3% will be given to existing shareholders and management.\n\nAs of this writing, the price for WLL bonds were all between $15 - $16.50.\n\n[Example WLL Bond Pricing](https://imgur.com/a/ktLeGQo)\n\nUsing this, we can calculate what the bond market is pricing the restructured WLL at; multiplying the market value of all the outstanding bonds by 97% would give you the implied price of it. From the most recent [10-Q](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc%3D/Archives/edgar/data/1255474/000125547420000011/wll-20200331x10q.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1591575861876000), the face value of all notes involved in the bankruptcy agreement is $2.4B. Using the highest bond price of $16.5, or 0.165% of face value, the implied market cap of the restructured WLL would be $2.4B \\* \u00a00.165% \\* 97% = $384M.\n\nWith 91M shares outstanding, this would mean the fair value of the old WLL shares would be $384M \\* 3% / 91M = $0.13. As of writing, the current share price is more than 10 times higher than this, at $1.38.\n\nHow could this be possible? It\u2019s because absolutely no one speculates with bonds, and bond prices are usually entirely grounded in fundamentals; people buying bonds buy it to hold onto it and not to sell it later at a higher price. The opposite is clearly happening with WLL stocks. Noone is buying WLL to receive a small stake in the reorganized corporation once the bankruptcy agreement clears in the best case; if an institution really wanted it, they would have just bought the bonds. Instead, people are buying these shares because they believe they can sell it shortly after for a higher price. This is what\u2019s going on in the stock market right now, which is how bubbles form.\n\n**Making Tendies in a Bubble**\n\nOkay, so you now believe, like me, that the stock market is now in a bubble, and has been in a [longer-term bubble for the last decade](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fzmlsv/spy_1125_150p/). Does this mean that I should sell all my long positions, buy puts, and short the market? Absolutely not. **Never short a bubble**. The whole idea of a bubble is that asset prices no longer reflect its intrinsic value, but is based on sentiment and speculation. Just because it\u2019s overvalued now doesn\u2019t mean it will immediately crash, and there\u2019s nothing stopping it from being even more overvalued in the near future; fundamentals aren\u2019t stopping it anymore. This has been the most clear the past week, with the first wave of COVID-19 cases never actually ending, bad vaccine news, and most US cities literally on fire, yet the stock market is skyrocketing for no apparent reason.\n\nInstead, my personal strategy is to play into this bubble, while holding a substantial amount of VIX calls as a hedge for when the stock market bubble eventually pops. I\u2019m holding VIX calls of multiple strike prices and expiry dates, mostly in Fall, since I personally believe the stock market will go back towards reality once more companies become insolvent (i.e. Fed can no longer help them), and a second spike in cases forces countries around the world to a second wave of lockdowns, as warned by most medical experts.\n\nIn the meanwhile, I\u2019ll be using Technical Analysis, which is most useful for markets on assets with no fundamentals and driven by pure sentiment, to drive my short-term and medium-term strategies. Some of you who have been following me for the past few weeks may know that my previous thesis revolved around SPY never breaking above 293 (+2%), which looked like it was going to happen until it didn\u2019t. This is because according to historical precedents, breaking above this level will bring SPY above the 62% retracement, and 200D EMA, and cause a 1W MACD crossover, which always resulted in a V-shaped recovery and new ATHs soon after. Of course, back then I believed fundamentals still mattered a bit and that this would not happen, but I was clearly wrong and it became clear we're in a short-term super-bubble within the longer-term bubble; SPY will be hitting new ATHs within the next few weeks.\n\nMy personal strategy for playing the bubble is the same as previous weeks, for those that have been following me - if the market is pricing in a V-shaped recovery, go long on the weakest and most beaten-down stocks that are not currently in bankruptcy, since those will be skyrocketing within the next few weeks as we see a rotation of capital from strong stocks like FAANG that have retraced back to their ATHs towards weak stocks, such as airlines, cruises, and banks. In other words, I'm literally inversing my strategy from a few months ago. Two weeks ago, some of these positions included CCL, JPM, and BA, which I entered into as soon as I saw their 1W MACD crossover, and have been doing phenomenally well last week. However, I have since exited BA and JPM and taken profit and rolled them into M, GE, WFC, and DAL, among other positions.\n\n[CCL, Daily](https://imgur.com/a/XZrR7kj)\n\n[BA, Daily](https://imgur.com/a/YXFkNji)\n\n[GE, Daily](https://imgur.com/a/RrZftMq)\n\n[DAL, Daily](https://imgur.com/a/7OrpvTa)\n\nMy strategy for these tickers\u00a0are simple - enter long positions (i.e. calls) as soon as they break the 24% retracement, which acted as a resistance for these industries until recently, and hence means that their stock price will skyrocket once it breaks it, and exit at the 50% retracements. BA and JPM have since hit these marks, so I exited. This week, I\u2019m holding calls from CCL, DAL, WFC, and GE, which has yet to have broken these levels. The market will probably need to consolidate next week because we\u2019ve had a lot of green days in a row, and it\u2019s getting pretty overbought, so I\u2019m not expecting these to print immediately. As I exit all of these positions and take profit, I\u2019ll be rolling half of the profits over towards more VIX calls for more hedging.\n\n# Live Updates\n\nAs always, I'll be posting some thoughts throughout the next few days in this thread below for people interested.\n\n6/7 8PM - Futures very green, especially /RTY, maybe the market is just gonna go for a 5th green day in a row with strong bullish momentum.",

        "selftext": "There seems to be a lot of misinformation around Electra Meccanica (SOLO)\u00a0 so I thought I would share my findings with the group.\n\nSOLO is based out of Vancouver, Canada, where I am from, and\u00a0 is co-founded by their COO/President Henry Reisner.\n\nHenry and his family started in the car Business in the 80s when they founded the company intermeccanica which created high quality Porsche speedster replicas. From my understanding Intermeccanica is still a separate company owned by the Reisner family but they are closely connected to SOLO.\u00a0\n\nThe replica Porsche company has been and still is extremely successful and the family has actually written a book about how they developed the company.\n\nI have actually met with Members of the Reisner family at the international Vancouver auto show where they had their SOLO vehicles on display. They are car people and mentioned how it was extremely important that car people would enjoy how their handles which makes sense with them being Porsche people.\n\nFrom what I understand they made a lot of money to start the company by selling electric versions of their porsche speedster which Bill gates is seen driving around in with Warren Buffet :o\n\nThe product that could potentially make this company\u2019s worth increase greatly is their 1 seater called the solo.\u00a0\n\nThe Single seater has been in small scale production in Asia already and they have a small fleet of those cars already built which can be seen in their Vancouver showroom.\u00a0\n\nAs many have heard their CEO is looking for a production plant in Arizona and other states and we have already seen what a fake press release of a new production plant can do.\n\nThe Largest risk to the company in the short term is IMO is the possibility of not securing a US production site as expected\n\nThe company also has value because to my understanding they are actually producing their own technology and electronics as they are scooping up Phd electrical engineers in the past few years and still are. Companies like rimac who have also developed tech like their received revenue by selling tech to larger car companies who need a fast way into electric cars which is a growing market.\n\nTLDR:\n\nPros:\n\n* Lots of preorders for single seater\u00a0\n* Established Electric Porsche speedster Line (w customers like bill gates and warren buffet )\n* Very likely to soon close on a production facility for Preorders\n* A press release of production facility will Bring us to the moon\n* Good proprietary technology\u00a0\n* Good Driving cars (They are actually car enthusiast not just a group of hippies)\n\nCons:\n\n* Possibility that they may fail to secure a production plant\u00a0\n* IN the long term when the Solo car comes out it may not be perceived well\n\nOverall I think this company is definitely a steal the short term as it should definitely at least reach it\u2019s pre covid levels of about $2.50 and  MUCH higher if they secure a production plant. This company Probably won't be the new tesla but I definitely think some good press about their cars once production starts could really push the company up to the moon\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nAlso if this gets on jay Lenos garage \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83c\udf19 \n(Had to have emojis in there)\n\nReferences:\n\nBuffet and Gates in car:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQWkNXr2ujI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQWkNXr2ujI)\n\nPre Orders:\n\n[https://electrameccanica.com/electra-meccanica-announces-vehicle-pre-orders-now-exceed-64000-units/](https://electrameccanica.com/electra-meccanica-announces-vehicle-pre-orders-now-exceed-64000-units/)\n\nProduction plans and car Info:\n\nhttps://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/\\_d6e0f90ec1740fc6d44522270bb3bc3f/electrameccanica/db/354/2669/pdf/SOLO+June+2020+Investor+Presentation.pdf\n\nInvestor site:\n\n[https://investors.electrameccanica.com](https://investors.electrameccanica.com/)",

        "selftext": "*TL/DR: I'm bearish because of the looming unemployment, the market is already overbought, the fed can't fix every part of the economy, and because of the political and social unrest this year already has and will continue to bring. Would love to hear and discuss counter arguments.*\n\nI've been hearing countless arguments, first from the bears that COVID was undoubtedly the start of the next Great Depression, then from the bulls that were laughing at the bears because J Powell cancelled the recession and the V shape recovery is looking pretty good.  So here we are, 3 months later and the market is heading back toward the all time highs of February.\n\nI can understand a lot of the bulls argument and the \"don't fight the fed\" mentality. Right now, there really isn't a better place to stash your money than stocks. However, if we really sit down and think about what has already happened and what is on the way for the rest of this year, I truly can't see this momentum going through 2020 and into 2021. I still have some individual positions that I will continue to hold, but I am considering putting a lot of money into an inverse S&amp;P500 ETF (SH, SDS, SPXU) and watching as the next year unfolds. My bear argument for the next year:  \n***1)*** ***Unemployment:*** Unemployment is currently sitting at 40 million Americans. Recent study from the University of Chicago ([here](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/20/most-americans-see-layoffs-as-temporary-but-research-shows-otherwise.html)) says that 42% of those people won't have jobs to come back to. Even being conservative on the study and assuming 25%...that is 6 million people permanently unemployed. \n\nEvery company and industry has had to learn to adapt to at home work for the last 3 months, and that's going to cause a lot of companies to take a look at what jobs are really necessary to function and likely leave lower skilled Americans without jobs.\n\n***2) Market was already overbought before COVID and still is:*** Pretty straightforward on this one, coming into 2020 the market was already seriously overbought after the 11 year bull run and was due for a correction. It got a massive correction, but now is right back into overbought territory. PE is 23 and Shiller PE is 28.73 (median is 15.78)...a correction at these levels seems likely even without COVID. Low interest rates have made stocks the only game in town which is why they are being flooded into, but that does not make a lot of these companies well-run businesses worthy of their current valuation. Balance sheets and cash flows matter, and eventually investors are going to expect to see earnings, and a lot of these high flying \"COVID stocks\" won't be able to provide them.\n\n  \n***3)*** ***\"Unlimited\" QE can only do so much:*** I know, don't fight the fed. The fed can print money, but it can't create demand and jobs. If my case about unemployment and overbought markets are even halfway true, the feds printing is only a band-aid that will eventually have to be taken off.\n\nWe also don't really have a great idea of what \"unlimited QE\" even really means or looks like. Does it mean infinite from a dollars scale and/or a time scale? Does this unlimited QE only apply to what the fed considers COVID related issues, or will they just have to keep printing like this in 5 years or 10 years for any decline? Essentially I feel like the market is being completely propped up by the Fed, but that printing cash doesn't actually generate demand and *genuine* cash flows for a company\n\n  \n***4) Political and Social Unrest:*** This is the one that everyone knows about and almost jokes about at this point. Another set of bad news and the market roars higher. How sustainable is it really?\n\nI believe that COVID alone was enough to drag down the market substantially...but we have so much more going on than just COVID. \n\nWe have a President of the #1 economy who blames COVID directly on the #2 economy in the world...which will almost guarantee there is no trade deal happening with China anytime soon. With COVID, Hong Kong, and Trump, the situation with China will only deteriorate as the years go on. \n\nWe have an election year with arguably the most controversial president of all time who is going to use all means necessary to win or defraud the election. Either Trump wins another 4 years and we trust him to rebuild us in a post-COVID world, or he loses and very likely creates what will certainly be a democratic crisis. How many people truly see him going away peacefully? All we need is a couple of close states and \"fake news, election fraud\" are all over his Twitter and Fox News and we have a genuine crisis on our hands. Can't imagine this November-January being pretty in either scenario.\n\nSocial unrest is here to stay. People are furious right now and the cities aren't just burning because of one thing (although police brutality toward African Americans is a MAJOR issue) but because of YEARS of mistreatment and a system that does not work. The system is rigged against those in the bottom, the wealth gap has been growing for years, and I feel that these protests, pushed further by Trump, is society's way of showing that this just isn't sustainable. The masses at the bottom are demanding a true change. I'm not sure if they're going to get it or not, but I'm pretty confident they won't between now and November.\n\nSo...all that being said...I'm shorting the market using inverse ETFs. Who agrees?",

After this report was released, Huawei attempted to obfuscate it's dealings with Skycom leading to another detailed report being released in March of 2013.  (The [2012 report](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-huawei-hp/exclusive-huawei-partner-offered-embargoed-hp-gear-to-iran-idUSBRE8BT0BF20121230) / [2013 report](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-huawei-skycom/exclusive-huawei-cfo-linked-to-firm-that-offered-hp-gear-to-iran-idUKBRE90U0CA20130131) respectively). \n\nIn response to the Reuters articles released in 2012 and 2013, several banks questioned Huawei about its relationship with Skycom. This included HSBC, where both Huawei and Skycom held bank accounts.\n\nIn the U.S. indictment, specifically, Meng is being charged for participating in fraud involving HSBC. But this was a point of contention since the representations she made weren't technically criminal under Canadian law, i.e. no sanctions. What was criminal, however, and what ultimately led to Meng being charged is the actual act of making fraudulent misrepresentations, which is criminal in both the U.S. and Canada as well. ([The full 36 page Supreme Court ruling if you're interested in reading](https://www.scribd.com/document/463254844/2020-BCSC-785-United-States-v-Meng))\n\n**Expected Outcomes**\n\nMoving forward, I think the primary question we have to consider now, is what exactly is going to happen once Meng is extradited to the United States. Were it any other case, this would be a pretty clear cut white collar fraud cause. Of course, this isn't just any case, and the context of the trade tensions between the U.S. and China as well as ongoing geopolitical issues like with the Hong Kong protests, all have to be taken into account.",

        "selftext": "In The Big Short (2015), Mark Baum and his crew [checked what the people they were betting against knew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCx5Ph7EAxg). It turned out that the people they were betting against knew nothing about the impending housing crash: \"business is good, profits are strong, and the mortgage continues to be the bedrock of the economy\". What Front Point Partners knew was still a secret.\n\nOn the other hand, the doomers in this sub kept repeating the same arguments over and over again: second wave, huge unemployment, etc. That **wasn't a big secret** to anyone. People with money to move markets knew that, and rightfully shrugged it off. I know it's become a meme here, but that's what priced in means.\n\nUnless you know something most people haven't figure out yet, you're not going to beat the market. In high frequency trading, this advantage is done by getting relatively simple information faster than everyone else - rule of thumb, if it's on the news already, it's been arbitraged away. In longer term investing, this is done through predictive models. The medium frequency traders find ways to predict probabilities of momentum and reversal to mean, and the low frequency traders, also known as investors, will model the future cashflows of the business based on macro, industry, and other types of information.\n\nFinally, when you think the market is irrational, just remember that means you're saying you're smarter than almost everyone else in the markets. The likelihood of that for the average Reddit user: 0%. So either, [be faster, smarter, but don't cheat](https://youtu.be/Hhy7JUinlu0?t=381).",

        "selftext": "I am posting my portfolio and strategies here to gain insight and hopefully learn from those that are much smarter than I am. Please be critical and constructive! \n\nI have decided to split my cash into two portfolios: core holdings and secondary portfolio which has a worth of 50% of my core holdings portfolio (150% total).\n\nThese are my targets for my core holdings portfolio:\n\n|Canadian Utilities (CU)|10.53%|\n|:-|:-|\n|Enbridge (ENB)|10.53%|\n|TD Bank (TD)|13.16%|\n|Canada West Bank (CWB)|13.16%|\n|Northwest Healthcare Properties REIT (NWH)|10.53%|\n|Riocan (REI)|21.05%|\n|Telus (T)|10.53%|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The reason I am drawn to these companies:\n   * I wanted to set up a dividend portfolio in my TFSA and reinvest dividends via DRIPs. These companies had high yields back in March when the pandemic hit and I saw an opportunity to lock in high yields with big, relatively safe Canadian companies that are an integral part of our economy. \n   * Other companies that I considered and may go back to:\n      * Financials: CIX, because it dropped harder than the banks and looking at the charts, I am expecting a breakout soon. I also considered all the other 5 big banks but went with TD due to their exposure to the US market. \n      * REITs: BPY, HR-UN. I am desperate to save enough money to open a DRIP with HR REIT. I believe they are undervalued according to their balance sheets and I did pick up a few shares at $8.20 and wish I had more cash to pour into it at that time. \n      * Communications: RCI, BCE, but decided on Telus due to their EMR market share. Also having first hand experience - their EMR is extremely user friendly and maintenance and administration is cheaper and easier than OSCAR based systems. This is especially true for rural communities with an aging population since all those patients still carry flip phones and most just rely on their landline. Using Facetime or smartphone based tech makes them uncomfortable. Seeing the system in action during this lockdown, especially how well it works with a work from home model has increased my liking for the company since everything is integrated into the EMR. The main problem with OSCAR systems is that not all hospitals are compatible with it and syncing medical records across two different systems is a pain. Telus has made their system compatible with a lot of rural hospitals and thus been able to connect the doctors offices with their local hospitals. \n      * I also considered Northwest Company, and in the future, when I have enough saved for a DRIP, I will be adding that to my TFSA also. The reasoning behind this is they have captured a niche market and are serving underserved areas and developing reliance on their product. The strength of this company is reflected in its' aggressive V-shaped recovery during the pandemic. \n      * I may also swap out ENB for AltaGas, but for now I am comfortable holding ENB at least for a year or so to see how it reacts to the market while I collect dividends. Though, eventually I'd like to transition out of oil and into renewable energy or possibly hold both at the same time depending on my cash at hand. \n* Currently I am DCA-ing my way into the positions of my core holdings. I have currently invested 50% of my total core holdings budget and have a remaining 50% currently sitting as cash, waiting to be deployed. I know everyone says you can't time the market and that's the reason I have decided to DCA - however, I feel like the current rally in markets is premature and a correction is on the horizon which is why I have paused my DCA contributions for now. I want to spread the money out for a longer period of time, possibly past September and into November and possibly even into December. \n* This is where I have my first question - am I just being overly speculative and cautious? Should I just blindly buy stocks systematically every two weeks or is my strategy to pause contributions viable? I found that I ended up DCA-ing upwards as the markets have rallied and missed out on opportunities which I wouldn't have missed out on if I had invested as a lump sum in March. \n* My secondary portfolio is a bit less organized. I have used this portfolio to buy and hold for a few days and then take profits. So basically swing trading, but I wish I had more cash so I could have held on to some of these for longer and bought them earlier. Here are a few trades that I made in the past:\n   * ATE.V: I've been holding this since early April. Currently sitting on about 500 shares. I believe in the product but boy, has management really been bad with communicating with their share holders. Its a long term play, and management has a decent strategy going forward and I will continue to hold unless the company shows signs of completely tanking. \n   * QSR: Bought and sold, made a few bucks in profit in early march. Never intended to hold this long term but I may reevaluate that in the future. Long term I would have to decide between this or A &amp; W income fund.\n   * ATZ: made a tidy profit off Aritizia too, looking to re enter possibly next quarter.\n   * ROOT: Same as ATZ. No intention of reentry. \n   * CGX: bought when it was around $12 and sold when it hit $14. No intention of reentry.\n   * MIR.V: made a 50% (FIFTY!) profit but only had about $50 to put in initially. Cashed out at $80. I want to re enter with about $1K on this.\n   * HR-UN: Yeah, I swing (swung?) traded a REIT. Bought at $8.20 and sold at $10.20 Would have liked to hold it longer but wanted to free up cash. Looking to re enter next quarter. \n   * BMO: So basically I had about $1K sitting in cash and BMO was lagging the other banks as the sector was recovering so I bought as much as I could. Now I feel trapped since I got a great deal at around $61 and am considering moving this to my core holdings, but I already have enough financial sector exposure in my core portfolio. I am up around 20% and feel like if I hold I can make more profit. I am also, at the same time, very tempted to liquidate and carry the funds forward into my future investments which I will highlight below. Any thoughts on strategy regarding this would be appreciated. \n* Future investments in my secondary portfolio:\n   * Currently I'm working on a strategy to invest with my secondary portfolio. Basically I just need to decide cut down this list to about 4-6 companies and decide on entry points:\n      * [WELL](https://WELL.TO)\n      * ATZ\n      * GOOS\n      * BB\n      * FLT\n      * LSPD\n      * CSH-UN\n      * HR-UN\n      * MIR.V\n      * I am also looking at the following but would need to research more and drop some other tickers to pick these up: SVI, PLC, TFII\n   * Basically, I am looking for value and growth in these companies and looking to enter with about $1k for each. Personally I am very drawn towards WELL, ATZ, GOOS, MIR, LSPD and CSH-UN\n* Another question I had was if I am swing trading, should I not do that in my TFSA? I can liquidate a few positions and put them into a taxable account just for swing trading. I would leave my secondary portfolio in my TFSA as a growth only portfolio and separate some funds solely for swing trading (basically play money). \n* Am I better off just converting my cash to USD and investing in TSLA, BRK.B, and Apple, AMD, etc?\n* The reason I am waiting for next quarter to re enter is because I fully believe there will be a market correction and a possible second downturn due to requirements for emergency subsidies being tightened up. The government can only sustain this for so long. Secondly, I don't think losses will be fully realized until next quarter. Thirdly, there is a possibility for a credit crisis and the big banks are fully expecting this which is why they increased their loss provisions according to the latest financial reports. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd now the age old question - \"Why not just buy a couple of ETfs and forget about it?\"\n\nI strongly considered XDV, XDIV, XEI as the majority investments in my core holdings along with a few exposure ETF's like TEC, VHT, some international exposure and small cap value ETFs.   \n\n\nWhy did I decide against it? I feel like ETFs offer less value when it comes to value investing. Sure, they dropped in price when the markets went down but I still feel like the rebound is dampened (as are the drops) which is to be expected because the risk is also lower. However, if I invest $1K into WELL for example, I will receive 100% of the value when it pops up, whereas if I purchase a small cap health/tech ETF which includes WELL,  the ETF would probably return much less value to me, not to mention that during re-balancing, the fund manager could classify WELL to be a large cap company and balance the company out of the ETF since it doesn't meet the requirements anymore and I would have to live with that decision, or go out and buy it but at that point I'd have missed out on most of the growth. \n\nSecondly, I found that most ETFs that hold Canadian banks have a lower dividend yield than if I had just held the banks directly. Granted, it wouldn't be at the same weight and I would probably only hold one or two banks instead of all 5 via an ETF but I don't really care for holding all 5 and especially so if the dividend yield is higher. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore I started investing, I paper traded for years just out of curiosity and I was always interested in stock prices. I did a lot of research and learning before starting to invest and felt like I knew what I was doing. Now I feel like I have no idea what I am doing (lol). My goal for the next year or so is to try and fully understand options trading in order to make weekly income, paper trade and develop a strategy and by next March start options trading. Currently learning about the wheel strategy and am really excited about trying it out. \n\nI also want to gain US market exposure, namely in the tech sector. I feel like a lot of growth is to be had there.\n\nPlease let me know what you think! I need to know where I stand with my investment strategy. Constructive criticism is most welcome!",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 8th, 2020.\n\n# **Look for the S&amp;P 500 to turn positive for the year with a boost from the Fed in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/05/look-for-the-sp-500-to-turn-positive-for-the-year-with-a-boost-from-the-fed-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to reassure markets next week the central bank will do whatever it takes to help the economy heal. That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting is the big event for markets in the coming week. There are a few economic reports, including inflation data, the consumer price index Wednesday and producer prices Thursday. Weekly jobless claims will be important Thursday to see if there\u2019s a drop in continuing clams, after May\u2019s employment report showed a surprising record gain of 2.5 million jobs.\n*****\n&gt; The reopening trade was in full swing in the past week, especially Friday when stocks surged on the jobs report, which was expected to show a loss of 8.3 million jobs. The Nasdaq broke above its record high set on Feb. 19, and the S&amp;P 500 was just 1.1% away from turning positive for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Even before the jobs report, investors were loading up on financials, industrials, transports and small caps, which were up more than 8% for the week and 18.4% in the past month. S&amp;P financials were 12.1% higher on the week, S&amp;P industrials were up 10.5, and the NYSE airline index jumped more than 35.4.%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think next week is dominated by the reopening and it will be for another month,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. \u201cWith cyclicals outperforming, small [caps] outperforming, credit spreads coming in and then the bond yields going up, everybody \u2014 all facets of the financial markets \u2014 are sort of suggesting the same outcome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 3,193, a gain of 4.9%, and now traders are watching to see if it can scale the psychological 3,200 level. The Dow closed Friday at 27,110, up 6.8% for the week, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.4%, at 9,814 after reaching an intraday record high of 9,845 Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts say the market will likely look past the protests that broke out in cities across the U.S. after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Four policemen were charged with murder in his death. Looters joined the protests, some of which turned violent, but they quieted down towards the end of the week.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher for a third week in a row, but a change this past week has been the abrupt lurch higher in Treasury yields. The 10-year rose to a high of 0.95% Friday, a quarter-point move in just three sessions. The move was already underway but got a lift Wednesday when ADP jobs data was not nearly as bad as expected. Yields ripped even higher after the May employment report showed the unemployment rate actually fell to 13.3%, instead of climbing to 20%, as expected by economists.\n*****\n&gt; Bond strategists said the Treasury market was now acknowledging the potential for a recovery, but not in the exuberant way the stock market has been. Since March 23, the S&amp;P 500 has risen more than 45%, but it took the 10-year Treasury until this week to get back the yield level it was at when stocks bottomed.\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen said he believes a new bull market has been launched, but there could be pullbacks and some headwinds for the market coming up.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhen GDP is minus 30%, other issues don\u2019t matter. There\u2019s just one issue. But as the economy reopens again, the trade battles will matter again, presidential politics will matter again,\u201d said Paulsen, adding the budget deficit could also matter. \u201cI think we\u2019ll get removed from a sole focus. That isn\u2019t quite there but I think it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed begins its two-day meeting Tuesday, and will release its statement Wednesday afternoon, followed by a video briefing by Powell.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhey would the Fed want to disrupt this with anything?\u201d Paulsen said. \u201cThey\u2019re still going to support the economy. They\u2019re going to stay away from negative rates or yield curve management. They\u2019re not going to do anything to scare the markets. They might certainly reassure people that they are still ready to provide support.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America, said the Fed may clarify where it stands on some of the extraordinary moves it has taken since it cut rates to zero. The Fed has been supporting the markets with asset purchases and multiple programs for commercial paper, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds, for example.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe think right now they\u2019re just trying to get this Main Street lending program to work. The question is are they going to do more things around what they do in terms of forward guidance and next steps of macro easing,\u201d Harris said.\n*****\n&gt; There has been speculation that the Fed would do some type of so-called yield curve control, a program to keep interest rates capped at certain levels. \u201cI think it\u2019s too early for that,\u201d said Harris. He said the Fed would be guaranteeing low rates for a long period of time if it does yield curve control.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYield curve control is basically open-ended quantitative easing,\u201d he said. The Fed is currently buying Treasurys but if it wanted to stop yields from rising too much as the economy improves, it could make targeted purchases.\n*****\n&gt; Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said it\u2019s possible the Fed could announce the yield curve control. \u201cWe\u2019ve said they could implement yield curve control out to three years,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my mind that matches the length of the horizon of the economic projections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Powell has said the economy needs more fiscal help, and he could reiterate those comments Wednesday. President Donald Trump on Friday said he backs more stimulus. So far, the Democrats have put out a marker with their wish list for further spending, but there have been no negotiations.\n*****\n&gt; There was concern the strong jobs report could make it harder to get buy in for another big spending package. But some economists say the recovery needs a boost and states need funding to fill the holes in their budgets from coronavirus-related spending and a lack of tax receipts.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7klaXQm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PKTBzT2.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/a5JkAB6.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/M2x4Qoq.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qtJYfXN.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bjiJWjV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UAi19KJ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GQm4ruO.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uV1U7FN.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/wm2XJND.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yarkiMO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hFblu2G.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Stocks Outpacing Analyst Price Targets\n\n&gt; This morning's jobs report shocked the financial world -- most notably the economists whose job it is to provide estimates. The consensus estimate among economists for May nonfarm payrolls was projecting a loss of more than 7 million jobs. The actual number that was reported did not just show a smaller than expected job loss, but it actually showed a gain in jobs of more than 2.5 million.\n\n&gt; We're seeing a similar situation play out in the equity analyst community. With the S&amp;P 500 now up 40%+ since its low less than three months ago, the average stock in the index is now trading above its consensus analyst price target that looks 12 months out. Analysts have simply not been able to catch up to the rapid rise we've seen for equity prices.\n\n&gt; It's extremely rare to see share prices move above consensus analyst price targets. We don't have the historical daily data on this, but anecdotally we can't remember a time when the spread has been this wide. As shown below, at the end of 2019 when the S&amp;P finished a massive rally, equity prices were 5.5% below the consensus price target. That was seen as a very tight spread prior to what we're seeing now. At the lows in March, the average share price had dropped all the way to $92.50 compared to an average consensus price target of $143.20. That projected a gain of 54.9% at the time!\n\n&gt; Since March 23rd, the average share price has risen from $92.50 up to $138.40, while the average analyst price target has fallen from $143.20 to $136. Current price targets no longer project a gain for the average S&amp;P 500 stock, but rather a 1.7% drop.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/avgpricetarget.png))**\n\n&gt; # Nasdaq's Historical Run\n\n&gt; At its highs earlier this morning, the Nasdaq Composite was within 2% of its record high from earlier in the year. Besides the steep V-shape of the Nasdaq's pattern over the last four months, the other aspect of the chart that stands out is just how steep the 50-day moving average is trending lately.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-50DMAa.png))**\n\n&gt; To illustrate just how steep the Nasdaq's 50-DMA has become, the chart below shows the daily percentage change of the 50-day going back to 1971. Currently, the Nasdaq 50-DMA is rising at an average of over 0.5% per day. That's an incredible slope and a level that has been exceeded only a handful of times in the Nasdaq's 50-year history.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-Composite1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Big Gains From Smaller Tech\n\n&gt; It's still difficult to fathom the moves in the US equity market over the last four months. The fact that the Nasdaq and more specifically the Technology sector aren't far from record highs is definitely something no one was expecting two months ago. There's an old market saying that equities take the stairs up and the elevator down, but in the latest market cycle, the elevator up was almost as fast as the way down!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Nasdaq.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Technology-Sector.png))**\n\n&gt; If you've been following the markets, all you've likely heard up until recently is that large-cap tech, and more specifically, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Facebook (FB), are single-handedly driving the market higher. The reality is not nearly as clear-cut. Given their market caps, the \"Big 5\" (as they're often referred to) have done a lot of heavy lifting, but in terms of performance, they're hardly the only game in town.\n\n&gt; The table below lists Technology sector stocks in the Russell 3000 with market caps of more than $1 billion that are outperforming all of the 'big 5' tech stocks on a YTD basis. Actually, since Amazon is doing so well relative to the rest of the \"big 5\" these are all stocks that are outperforming Amazon. If we looked for stocks that were doing better than the average return of the \"big 5\" the list would be a lot, lot longer (+16.4%).\n\n&gt; Looking through the list of names below, the two top-performing names are Zscaler (ZS) and Twilio (TWLO), which have both more than doubled. Behind these two, DocuSign (DOCU) and Sprout Social (SPT) are both knocking on the door of triple-digits. All 28 of the names listed have market caps of $1 billion, but the average market cap is just over $21 billion, while Nvidia (NVDA) is the largest company on the list with a market cap of $216 billion. For the most part, these aren't names that have been driving the indices, but anyone holding these stocks in their portfolio probably doesn't care!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Tech-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Best 50-Day Rally Ever\n\n&gt; In many ways, what we\u2019ve seen so far in 2020 has been both record-breaking and devastating. From the S&amp;P 500 Index peak on February 19 to the bear market lows March 23, stocks lost 33.9%. Now, 50 trading days later, stocks have gained 39.6%, for the largest 50-day rally since the S&amp;P 500 moved to 500 stocks in 1957.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere are no rollercoasters that can replicate what stocks have done so far in 2020,\u201d exclaimed LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHere\u2019s the catch though: Big 50-day rallies in the past have taken place near the start of new bull markets, and the returns going out a year were quite bullish.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 39.6% gain in 50 days was the greatest 50-day rally ever, besting the previous best in October 1982. What\u2019s important to note here is that many of these rallies took place coming off major market lows, and delivered quite strong returns going out 6 to 12 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/best-fifty-days.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Although we have near-term worries given this historic run, as some sentiment indicators such as put/call ratios are showing some froth, from a bigger picture perspective, this strong 50-day rally offers a reason to think stock prices may be even higher this time next year.\n\n*****\n\n# 2020 In Charts\n\n&gt; 2020 is only five months old, but in many ways it is one of the most historic years we\u2019ve ever seen. \u201c2020 went from moving along nicely, to seeing the worst recession in a generation and the fastest bear market ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cNow stocks are in the midst of one of the best bull runs ever, even though the economy remains extremely weak, thanks to record stimulus and hopes over a vaccine.\u201d\n&gt; \nTo best sum it all up, here are 10 charts that tell the picture of 2020 so far.\n\n&gt; 1.) The 2010s were the first decade in history to go all 10 years without a recession, which of course ended just months into the new decade, as the economy stopped. Stocks gained 13.5% on an annual basis last decade, surprisingly, only the third-best decade over the past four.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 2.) This is an election year, and the S&amp;P 500 Index hasn\u2019t been lower when a President is up for reelection since FDR in 1940. Although this seemed nearly impossible at the March lows, it is looking like this incredible streak could have a chance in 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 3.) One of the first signs something could go wrong in 2020 was stocks fell in January. Historically, this has meant potential trouble for the final 11 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 4.) As fears over COVID-19 gripped the world, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its fastest bear market ever, in only 19 days. To put this in perspective, this was the fastest bear market in the 124-year history of the Dow.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 5.) Mark Twain said \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes\u201d. Looking at history, every 50 years there has been a terrible pandemic and stocks fell more than 30%. We don\u2019t know if the ultimate lows are in this time, but so far, history is rhyming.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 6.) More than 20 million people in the US lost their jobs in April, while the unemployment rate soared to near 15%, the highest since the Great Depression. Record drops in manufacturing, industrial production, retail sales, and consumer spending have all taken place in the past two months as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 7.) A recession is here, ending the streak of 128 months in a row without one. What is unique about the previous expansion was nominal gross domestic product (GDP) grew only 50%, about the average growth seen during the previous expansions, but this expansion was nearly twice as long as the average expansion (10 years versus 5 years).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 8.) The bounce off of the March 23 S&amp;P 500 lows has been historic in many ways. In fact, it was one of the best 20-day rallies ever, with previous best rallies seeing strong returns 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 9.) As scary as it was on the way down, stocks have come roaring back, gaining more than 35% from the March 23 lows. This would classify as the greatest bear market bounce ever, which opens the question: is this more than a bear market bounce and instead the start of a new bull market?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 10.) The number of COVID-19 tests in the US nearly doubled in May versus what was seen in April. Additionally, fewer and fewer tests are coming back positive. Testing is one of the key ways we will beat this and this is a step in the right direction. We\u2019ve also seen new monthly lows in people on ventilators, in the ICU, and in hospitals.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Hard to believe, but there are still 7 months left in 2020. It hasn\u2019t been easy for any of us, and we continue to keep everyone impacted by this pandemic in mind, but we continue to see the glass as half full. The dual benefit of record monetary and fiscal policy should help create a bridge to help those most impacted, while the economy can slowly come back online later this year.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending June 5th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1HAZbHiMUI))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 6.7.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n*(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)*\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$ADBE** \n&gt; * **$UNFI** \n&gt; * **$CHWY** \n&gt; * **$TIF** \n&gt; * **$LULU** \n&gt; * **$COUP** \n&gt; * **$SFIX** \n&gt; * **$LOVE** \n&gt; * **$NEPT** \n&gt; * **$GHM** \n&gt; * **$REVG** \n&gt; * **$GME** \n&gt; * **$HDS** \n&gt; * **$FIVE** \n&gt; * **$SIG** \n&gt; * **$CASY** \n&gt; * **$CVGW** \n&gt; * **$AMC** \n&gt; * **$FCEL** \n&gt; * **$QTNT** \n&gt; * **$PLCE** \n&gt; * **$CHS** \n&gt; * **$THO** \n&gt; * **$GCO** \n&gt; * **$BF.B** \n&gt; * **$LMNR** \n&gt; * **$WSG** \n&gt; * **$PRTY** \n&gt; * **$GES** \n&gt; * **$BBCP** \n&gt; * **$CONN** \n&gt; * **$HEXO** \n&gt; * **$PHR** \n&gt; * **$PVH** \n&gt; * **$RRGB** \n&gt; * **$PLAY** \n&gt; * **$TNP** \n&gt; * **$JW.A** \n&gt; * **$SB** \n&gt; * **$GSM** \n&gt; * **$SRT**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/bgPdMCr.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.8.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/d2EW1kr.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uxSiJJr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.9.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3SIjcG7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cRBrPlt.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.10.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DaheXAm.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9mcHxTl.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.11.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/i8SNjWM.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9xcBZPK.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.12.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Inc. $392.90\n&gt; **Adobe Inc.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 8th, 2020.\n\n# **Look for the S&amp;P 500 to turn positive for the year with a boost from the Fed in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/05/look-for-the-sp-500-to-turn-positive-for-the-year-with-a-boost-from-the-fed-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to reassure markets next week the central bank will do whatever it takes to help the economy heal. That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting is the big event for markets in the coming week. There are a few economic reports, including inflation data, the consumer price index Wednesday and producer prices Thursday. Weekly jobless claims will be important Thursday to see if there\u2019s a drop in continuing clams, after May\u2019s employment report showed a surprising record gain of 2.5 million jobs.\n*****\n&gt; The reopening trade was in full swing in the past week, especially Friday when stocks surged on the jobs report, which was expected to show a loss of 8.3 million jobs. The Nasdaq broke above its record high set on Feb. 19, and the S&amp;P 500 was just 1.1% away from turning positive for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Even before the jobs report, investors were loading up on financials, industrials, transports and small caps, which were up more than 8% for the week and 18.4% in the past month. S&amp;P financials were 12.1% higher on the week, S&amp;P industrials were up 10.5, and the NYSE airline index jumped more than 35.4.%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think next week is dominated by the reopening and it will be for another month,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. \u201cWith cyclicals outperforming, small [caps] outperforming, credit spreads coming in and then the bond yields going up, everybody \u2014 all facets of the financial markets \u2014 are sort of suggesting the same outcome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 3,193, a gain of 4.9%, and now traders are watching to see if it can scale the psychological 3,200 level. The Dow closed Friday at 27,110, up 6.8% for the week, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.4%, at 9,814 after reaching an intraday record high of 9,845 Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts say the market will likely look past the protests that broke out in cities across the U.S. after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Four policemen were charged with murder in his death. Looters joined the protests, some of which turned violent, but they quieted down towards the end of the week.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher for a third week in a row, but a change this past week has been the abrupt lurch higher in Treasury yields. The 10-year rose to a high of 0.95% Friday, a quarter-point move in just three sessions. The move was already underway but got a lift Wednesday when ADP jobs data was not nearly as bad as expected. Yields ripped even higher after the May employment report showed the unemployment rate actually fell to 13.3%, instead of climbing to 20%, as expected by economists.\n*****\n&gt; Bond strategists said the Treasury market was now acknowledging the potential for a recovery, but not in the exuberant way the stock market has been. Since March 23, the S&amp;P 500 has risen more than 45%, but it took the 10-year Treasury until this week to get back the yield level it was at when stocks bottomed.\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen said he believes a new bull market has been launched, but there could be pullbacks and some headwinds for the market coming up.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhen GDP is minus 30%, other issues don\u2019t matter. There\u2019s just one issue. But as the economy reopens again, the trade battles will matter again, presidential politics will matter again,\u201d said Paulsen, adding the budget deficit could also matter. \u201cI think we\u2019ll get removed from a sole focus. That isn\u2019t quite there but I think it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed begins its two-day meeting Tuesday, and will release its statement Wednesday afternoon, followed by a video briefing by Powell.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhey would the Fed want to disrupt this with anything?\u201d Paulsen said. \u201cThey\u2019re still going to support the economy. They\u2019re going to stay away from negative rates or yield curve management. They\u2019re not going to do anything to scare the markets. They might certainly reassure people that they are still ready to provide support.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America, said the Fed may clarify where it stands on some of the extraordinary moves it has taken since it cut rates to zero. The Fed has been supporting the markets with asset purchases and multiple programs for commercial paper, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds, for example.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe think right now they\u2019re just trying to get this Main Street lending program to work. The question is are they going to do more things around what they do in terms of forward guidance and next steps of macro easing,\u201d Harris said.\n*****\n&gt; There has been speculation that the Fed would do some type of so-called yield curve control, a program to keep interest rates capped at certain levels. \u201cI think it\u2019s too early for that,\u201d said Harris. He said the Fed would be guaranteeing low rates for a long period of time if it does yield curve control.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYield curve control is basically open-ended quantitative easing,\u201d he said. The Fed is currently buying Treasurys but if it wanted to stop yields from rising too much as the economy improves, it could make targeted purchases.\n*****\n&gt; Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said it\u2019s possible the Fed could announce the yield curve control. \u201cWe\u2019ve said they could implement yield curve control out to three years,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my mind that matches the length of the horizon of the economic projections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Powell has said the economy needs more fiscal help, and he could reiterate those comments Wednesday. President Donald Trump on Friday said he backs more stimulus. So far, the Democrats have put out a marker with their wish list for further spending, but there have been no negotiations.\n*****\n&gt; There was concern the strong jobs report could make it harder to get buy in for another big spending package. But some economists say the recovery needs a boost and states need funding to fill the holes in their budgets from coronavirus-related spending and a lack of tax receipts.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7klaXQm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PKTBzT2.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/a5JkAB6.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/M2x4Qoq.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qtJYfXN.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bjiJWjV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UAi19KJ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GQm4ruO.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uV1U7FN.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/wm2XJND.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yarkiMO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hFblu2G.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Stocks Outpacing Analyst Price Targets\n\n&gt; This morning's jobs report shocked the financial world -- most notably the economists whose job it is to provide estimates. The consensus estimate among economists for May nonfarm payrolls was projecting a loss of more than 7 million jobs. The actual number that was reported did not just show a smaller than expected job loss, but it actually showed a gain in jobs of more than 2.5 million.\n\n&gt; We're seeing a similar situation play out in the equity analyst community. With the S&amp;P 500 now up 40%+ since its low less than three months ago, the average stock in the index is now trading above its consensus analyst price target that looks 12 months out. Analysts have simply not been able to catch up to the rapid rise we've seen for equity prices.\n\n&gt; It's extremely rare to see share prices move above consensus analyst price targets. We don't have the historical daily data on this, but anecdotally we can't remember a time when the spread has been this wide. As shown below, at the end of 2019 when the S&amp;P finished a massive rally, equity prices were 5.5% below the consensus price target. That was seen as a very tight spread prior to what we're seeing now. At the lows in March, the average share price had dropped all the way to $92.50 compared to an average consensus price target of $143.20. That projected a gain of 54.9% at the time!\n\n&gt; Since March 23rd, the average share price has risen from $92.50 up to $138.40, while the average analyst price target has fallen from $143.20 to $136. Current price targets no longer project a gain for the average S&amp;P 500 stock, but rather a 1.7% drop.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/avgpricetarget.png))**\n\n&gt; # Nasdaq's Historical Run\n\n&gt; At its highs earlier this morning, the Nasdaq Composite was within 2% of its record high from earlier in the year. Besides the steep V-shape of the Nasdaq's pattern over the last four months, the other aspect of the chart that stands out is just how steep the 50-day moving average is trending lately.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-50DMAa.png))**\n\n&gt; To illustrate just how steep the Nasdaq's 50-DMA has become, the chart below shows the daily percentage change of the 50-day going back to 1971. Currently, the Nasdaq 50-DMA is rising at an average of over 0.5% per day. That's an incredible slope and a level that has been exceeded only a handful of times in the Nasdaq's 50-year history.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-Composite1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Big Gains From Smaller Tech\n\n&gt; It's still difficult to fathom the moves in the US equity market over the last four months. The fact that the Nasdaq and more specifically the Technology sector aren't far from record highs is definitely something no one was expecting two months ago. There's an old market saying that equities take the stairs up and the elevator down, but in the latest market cycle, the elevator up was almost as fast as the way down!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Nasdaq.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Technology-Sector.png))**\n\n&gt; If you've been following the markets, all you've likely heard up until recently is that large-cap tech, and more specifically, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Facebook (FB), are single-handedly driving the market higher. The reality is not nearly as clear-cut. Given their market caps, the \"Big 5\" (as they're often referred to) have done a lot of heavy lifting, but in terms of performance, they're hardly the only game in town.\n\n&gt; The table below lists Technology sector stocks in the Russell 3000 with market caps of more than $1 billion that are outperforming all of the 'big 5' tech stocks on a YTD basis. Actually, since Amazon is doing so well relative to the rest of the \"big 5\" these are all stocks that are outperforming Amazon. If we looked for stocks that were doing better than the average return of the \"big 5\" the list would be a lot, lot longer (+16.4%).\n\n&gt; Looking through the list of names below, the two top-performing names are Zscaler (ZS) and Twilio (TWLO), which have both more than doubled. Behind these two, DocuSign (DOCU) and Sprout Social (SPT) are both knocking on the door of triple-digits. All 28 of the names listed have market caps of $1 billion, but the average market cap is just over $21 billion, while Nvidia (NVDA) is the largest company on the list with a market cap of $216 billion. For the most part, these aren't names that have been driving the indices, but anyone holding these stocks in their portfolio probably doesn't care!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Tech-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Best 50-Day Rally Ever\n\n&gt; In many ways, what we\u2019ve seen so far in 2020 has been both record-breaking and devastating. From the S&amp;P 500 Index peak on February 19 to the bear market lows March 23, stocks lost 33.9%. Now, 50 trading days later, stocks have gained 39.6%, for the largest 50-day rally since the S&amp;P 500 moved to 500 stocks in 1957.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere are no rollercoasters that can replicate what stocks have done so far in 2020,\u201d exclaimed LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHere\u2019s the catch though: Big 50-day rallies in the past have taken place near the start of new bull markets, and the returns going out a year were quite bullish.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 39.6% gain in 50 days was the greatest 50-day rally ever, besting the previous best in October 1982. What\u2019s important to note here is that many of these rallies took place coming off major market lows, and delivered quite strong returns going out 6 to 12 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/best-fifty-days.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Although we have near-term worries given this historic run, as some sentiment indicators such as put/call ratios are showing some froth, from a bigger picture perspective, this strong 50-day rally offers a reason to think stock prices may be even higher this time next year.\n\n*****\n\n# 2020 In Charts\n\n&gt; 2020 is only five months old, but in many ways it is one of the most historic years we\u2019ve ever seen. \u201c2020 went from moving along nicely, to seeing the worst recession in a generation and the fastest bear market ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cNow stocks are in the midst of one of the best bull runs ever, even though the economy remains extremely weak, thanks to record stimulus and hopes over a vaccine.\u201d\n&gt; \nTo best sum it all up, here are 10 charts that tell the picture of 2020 so far.\n\n&gt; 1.) The 2010s were the first decade in history to go all 10 years without a recession, which of course ended just months into the new decade, as the economy stopped. Stocks gained 13.5% on an annual basis last decade, surprisingly, only the third-best decade over the past four.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 2.) This is an election year, and the S&amp;P 500 Index hasn\u2019t been lower when a President is up for reelection since FDR in 1940. Although this seemed nearly impossible at the March lows, it is looking like this incredible streak could have a chance in 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 3.) One of the first signs something could go wrong in 2020 was stocks fell in January. Historically, this has meant potential trouble for the final 11 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 4.) As fears over COVID-19 gripped the world, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its fastest bear market ever, in only 19 days. To put this in perspective, this was the fastest bear market in the 124-year history of the Dow.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 5.) Mark Twain said \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes\u201d. Looking at history, every 50 years there has been a terrible pandemic and stocks fell more than 30%. We don\u2019t know if the ultimate lows are in this time, but so far, history is rhyming.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 6.) More than 20 million people in the US lost their jobs in April, while the unemployment rate soared to near 15%, the highest since the Great Depression. Record drops in manufacturing, industrial production, retail sales, and consumer spending have all taken place in the past two months as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 7.) A recession is here, ending the streak of 128 months in a row without one. What is unique about the previous expansion was nominal gross domestic product (GDP) grew only 50%, about the average growth seen during the previous expansions, but this expansion was nearly twice as long as the average expansion (10 years versus 5 years).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 8.) The bounce off of the March 23 S&amp;P 500 lows has been historic in many ways. In fact, it was one of the best 20-day rallies ever, with previous best rallies seeing strong returns 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 9.) As scary as it was on the way down, stocks have come roaring back, gaining more than 35% from the March 23 lows. This would classify as the greatest bear market bounce ever, which opens the question: is this more than a bear market bounce and instead the start of a new bull market?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 10.) The number of COVID-19 tests in the US nearly doubled in May versus what was seen in April. Additionally, fewer and fewer tests are coming back positive. Testing is one of the key ways we will beat this and this is a step in the right direction. We\u2019ve also seen new monthly lows in people on ventilators, in the ICU, and in hospitals.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Hard to believe, but there are still 7 months left in 2020. It hasn\u2019t been easy for any of us, and we continue to keep everyone impacted by this pandemic in mind, but we continue to see the glass as half full. The dual benefit of record monetary and fiscal policy should help create a bridge to help those most impacted, while the economy can slowly come back online later this year.\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$ADBE** \n&gt; * **$UNFI** \n&gt; * **$CHWY** \n&gt; * **$TIF** \n&gt; * **$LULU** \n&gt; * **$COUP** \n&gt; * **$SFIX** \n&gt; * **$LOVE** \n&gt; * **$NEPT** \n&gt; * **$GHM** \n&gt; * **$REVG** \n&gt; * **$GME** \n&gt; * **$HDS** \n&gt; * **$FIVE** \n&gt; * **$SIG** \n&gt; * **$CASY** \n&gt; * **$CVGW** \n&gt; * **$AMC** \n&gt; * **$FCEL** \n&gt; * **$QTNT** \n&gt; * **$PLCE** \n&gt; * **$CHS** \n&gt; * **$THO** \n&gt; * **$GCO** \n&gt; * **$BF.B** \n&gt; * **$LMNR** \n&gt; * **$WSG** \n&gt; * **$PRTY** \n&gt; * **$GES** \n&gt; * **$BBCP** \n&gt; * **$CONN** \n&gt; * **$HEXO** \n&gt; * **$PHR** \n&gt; * **$PVH** \n&gt; * **$RRGB** \n&gt; * **$PLAY** \n&gt; * **$TNP** \n&gt; * **$JW.A** \n&gt; * **$SB** \n&gt; * **$GSM** \n&gt; * **$SRT**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/bgPdMCr.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.8.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/d2EW1kr.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uxSiJJr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.9.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3SIjcG7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cRBrPlt.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.10.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DaheXAm.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9mcHxTl.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.11.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/i8SNjWM.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9xcBZPK.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.12.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Inc. $392.90\n&gt; **Adobe Inc.

        "selftext": "The Oracle of Omaha has a reputation as the gentle GOAT, but is there more to this than meets the eye?\n\nIs there something that is often overlooked?\n\nOr is this reputation warranted? (get it...warren, warranted?)\n\nAnyway...Let's begin...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe story begins in 1942, when Warren Buffet bought his first shares at the age of just 11. \n\nThis is same year that his father Howard Buffett ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in the Nebraska district.\n\nHe won, and became a member of Congress in 1943.\n\nBefore this, Howard worked at a small stock brokerage firm.\n\nHe was reelected twice. However, in 1952, he decided against seeking another term and returned to his investment business in Omaha,\u00a0Buffett-Falk &amp; Co., where he worked until shortly before his death in 1964.\n\nBut what about Warren Buffett?\n\nIn 1951, after graduating from Columbia, where he was taught by Benjamin Graham, Buffett worked for three years at his father's firm as an investment salesman. \n\nIn 1954, Buffett accepted a job at Benjamin Graham's partnership, working as a securities analyst.\n\nHis starting salary was $12,000 a year - the equivalent of $114,000 today.\n\nHowever, just two years later, Graham retired and Buffett started his own investment partnership.\n\nHe went to his father's acquaintances to raise Capital for his first fund. \n\nThese were prominent families in Nebraska with big businesses and political connections.\n\nFor example, across the street was the family whose son became the CEO of Coca Cola - that family gave him $10,000.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn 2012, the STOCK Act or The Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act was signed into law.\u00a0 \n\nThe law prohibits the use of non-public information for private profit, including insider trading by members of Congress and other government employees.\n\nRemember, Buffett's father used to be in Congress.\n\n***The only people who were, before 2012, allowed to trade on insider information without having criminal charges brought against them were congressmen.***\n\nRemember, Buffett's father was a stock market broker prior to being elected and going to Congress, hence he had a comprehensive knowledge of the stock market and clearly had an interest in it. \n\nAfter all, it was his father who taught Buffett the ropes early on and had him buy his first shares as an eleven year old.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImagine you are Warren Buffett, and you can:\n\n1). Get insider information to trade on it;\n\n2). Get a six-figure position after College;\n\n3). After a few years, set up your own fund, getting money from wealthy family friends;\n\n4). Pay no dividends to investors and only put a hundred bucks of your own money into the fund;\n\n5). Let the mathematics of compounding work its magic as you bring in more institutional money;\n\n6). Become so connected Politically and connected on Wall Street that you can get special deals, which have practically no risk as you know bailouts are coming. For example, in the 2008 crisis, Berkshire owned stock valued at more than $13 billion in the top recipients of the TARP funds, and Berkshire had at least twice as much dependence on bailed-out banks as any other large investor;\n\n7). Have billions of dollars on hand, remember you aren't paying any dividends to investors, ready for the inevitable economic recession to hit so that you can sweep up cheap assets;\n\n8). Be holier-than-thou (i.e. calling derivatives \"financial weapons of mass destruction\" when, during the height of the 2008 crisis, Berkshire sold more than $2.5 billion worth of credit default swaps. OR what about Buffett's reputation as the saviour in the Great Recession when Berkshire is the majority owner of Moody's, who played a key role in inflating the crisis in 2008 - via their questionable debt and derivative ratings which inflated the mortgage and subprime market).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat about Buffett's status as the GOAT?\n\n[Jim Simons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcy8QaILDJI) has a far superior track record.\n\nBillionaire Chamath Palihapitiya has even stated that [Jeff Bezos is the best investor of our generation](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/12/chamath-palihapitiya-amazons-jeff-bezos-the-best-investor-better-than-warren-buffett.html#:~:text=Chamath%20Palihapitiya%20calls%20Amazon's%20Jeff%20Bezos,investor%2C%20better%20than%20Warren%20Buffett&amp;text=%E2%80%9CPeople%20used%20to%20lambaste%20Jeff,said%20on%20%E2%80%9CSquawk%20Box.%E2%80%9D), not Warren Buffett.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBuffett has missed out on an entire raft of tech and Berkshire has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 in recent years.\n\nBerkshire's best years are found overwhelmingly in the period before the tech era.\n\nAlso, he has been critical of Bitcoin, describing it as \"rat poison squared\"\n\nUltimately, Buffett is worth $73 billion, he doesn't need to have an in-depth understanding of new age tech.\n\nMoreover, Buffett has a huge stake in Finance 1.0, why would he give props to Finance 2.0?\n\nBitcoin as a savings vehicle is misaligned with Berkshire's don't-save-money-invest-it-in-us or consume more of the products of the businesses that Berkshire has a huge stake in, and is also misaligned with Berkshire's Cantillon insider advantages.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's worth noting that Howard Buffett strongly supported the gold standard because he believed it would limit the ability of government to inflate the money supply and spend beyond its means. Here is a direct quote from Howard:\n\n***\"I warn you that politicians of both parties will oppose the restoration of gold, although they may outwardly seemingly favor it,\u00a0unless you are willing to surrender your children and your country to galloping inflation, war and slavery\u00a0then this cause demands your support. For if human liberty is to survive in America, we must win the battle to restore honest money. There is no more important challenge facing us than this issue -- the restoration of your freedom to secure gold in exchange for the fruits of your labors.\"***\n\nHis son Warren, however, hates gold. See the [Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs) as to why.\n\n**Some have even argued that Buffett's success can be summarised by the following:**\n\n**First Deals = Insider Information**\n\n**Last Deals = Cantillon Effect**\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nIs it true... or false?\n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UpTUBgUYgc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UpTUBgUYgc)",

There are a few economic reports, including inflation data, the consumer price index Wednesday and producer prices Thursday. Weekly jobless claims will be important Thursday to see if there\u2019s a drop in continuing clams, after May\u2019s employment report showed a surprising record gain of 2.5 million jobs.\n*****\n&gt; The reopening trade was in full swing in the past week, especially Friday when stocks surged on the jobs report, which was expected to show a loss of 8.3 million jobs. The Nasdaq broke above its record high set on Feb. 19, and the S&amp;P 500 was just 1.1% away from turning positive for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Even before the jobs report, investors were loading up on financials, industrials, transports and small caps, which were up more than 8% for the week and 18.4% in the past month. S&amp;P financials were 12.1% higher on the week, S&amp;P industrials were up 10.5, and the NYSE airline index jumped more than 35.4.%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think next week is dominated by the reopening and it will be for another month,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. \u201cWith cyclicals outperforming, small [caps] outperforming, credit spreads coming in and then the bond yields going up, everybody \u2014 all facets of the financial markets \u2014 are sort of suggesting the same outcome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 3,193, a gain of 4.9%, and now traders are watching to see if it can scale the psychological 3,200 level. The Dow closed Friday at 27,110, up 6.8% for the week, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.4%, at 9,814 after reaching an intraday record high of 9,845 Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts say the market will likely look past the protests that broke out in cities across the U.S. after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Four policemen were charged with murder in his death. Looters joined the protests, some of which turned violent, but they quieted down towards the end of the week.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher for a third week in a row, but a change this past week has been the abrupt lurch higher in Treasury yields. The 10-year rose to a high of 0.95% Friday, a quarter-point move in just three sessions. The move was already underway but got a lift Wednesday when ADP jobs data was not nearly as bad as expected. Yields ripped even higher after the May employment report showed the unemployment rate actually fell to 13.3%, instead of climbing to 20%, as expected by economists.\n*****\n&gt; Bond strategists said the Treasury market was now acknowledging the potential for a recovery, but not in the exuberant way the stock market has been. Since March 23, the S&amp;P 500 has risen more than 45%, but it took the 10-year Treasury until this week to get back the yield level it was at when stocks bottomed.\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen said he believes a new bull market has been launched, but there could be pullbacks and some headwinds for the market coming up.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhen GDP is minus 30%, other issues don\u2019t matter. There\u2019s just one issue. But as the economy reopens again, the trade battles will matter again, presidential politics will matter again,\u201d said Paulsen, adding the budget deficit could also matter. \u201cI think we\u2019ll get removed from a sole focus. That isn\u2019t quite there but I think it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed begins its two-day meeting Tuesday, and will release its statement Wednesday afternoon, followed by a video briefing by Powell.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhey would the Fed want to disrupt this with anything?\u201d Paulsen said. \u201cThey\u2019re still going to support the economy. They\u2019re going to stay away from negative rates or yield curve management. They\u2019re not going to do anything to scare the markets. They might certainly reassure people that they are still ready to provide support.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America, said the Fed may clarify where it stands on some of the extraordinary moves it has taken since it cut rates to zero. The Fed has been supporting the markets with asset purchases and multiple programs for commercial paper, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds, for example.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe think right now they\u2019re just trying to get this Main Street lending program to work. The question is are they going to do more things around what they do in terms of forward guidance and next steps of macro easing,\u201d Harris said.\n*****\n&gt; There has been speculation that the Fed would do some type of so-called yield curve control, a program to keep interest rates capped at certain levels. \u201cI think it\u2019s too early for that,\u201d said Harris. He said the Fed would be guaranteeing low rates for a long period of time if it does yield curve control.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYield curve control is basically open-ended quantitative easing,\u201d he said. The Fed is currently buying Treasurys but if it wanted to stop yields from rising too much as the economy improves, it could make targeted purchases.\n*****\n&gt; Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said it\u2019s possible the Fed could announce the yield curve control. \u201cWe\u2019ve said they could implement yield curve control out to three years,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my mind that matches the length of the horizon of the economic projections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Powell has said the economy needs more fiscal help, and he could reiterate those comments Wednesday. President Donald Trump on Friday said he backs more stimulus. So far, the Democrats have put out a marker with their wish list for further spending, but there have been no negotiations.\n*****\n&gt; There was concern the strong jobs report could make it harder to get buy in for another big spending package. But some economists say the recovery needs a boost and states need funding to fill the holes in their budgets from coronavirus-related spending and a lack of tax receipts.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7klaXQm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PKTBzT2.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/a5JkAB6.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/M2x4Qoq.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qtJYfXN.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bjiJWjV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UAi19KJ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GQm4ruO.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uV1U7FN.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/wm2XJND.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yarkiMO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hFblu2G.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Stocks Outpacing Analyst Price Targets\n\n&gt; This morning's jobs report shocked the financial world -- most notably the economists whose job it is to provide estimates. The consensus estimate among economists for May nonfarm payrolls was projecting a loss of more than 7 million jobs. The actual number that was reported did not just show a smaller than expected job loss, but it actually showed a gain in jobs of more than 2.5 million.\n\n&gt; We're seeing a similar situation play out in the equity analyst community. With the S&amp;P 500 now up 40%+ since its low less than three months ago, the average stock in the index is now trading above its consensus analyst price target that looks 12 months out. Analysts have simply not been able to catch up to the rapid rise we've seen for equity prices.\n\n&gt; It's extremely rare to see share prices move above consensus analyst price targets. We don't have the historical daily data on this, but anecdotally we can't remember a time when the spread has been this wide. As shown below, at the end of 2019 when the S&amp;P finished a massive rally, equity prices were 5.5% below the consensus price target. That was seen as a very tight spread prior to what we're seeing now. At the lows in March, the average share price had dropped all the way to $92.50 compared to an average consensus price target of $143.20. That projected a gain of 54.9% at the time!\n\n&gt; Since March 23rd, the average share price has risen from $92.50 up to $138.40, while the average analyst price target has fallen from $143.20 to $136. Current price targets no longer project a gain for the average S&amp;P 500 stock, but rather a 1.7% drop.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/avgpricetarget.png))**\n\n&gt; # Nasdaq's Historical Run\n\n&gt; At its highs earlier this morning, the Nasdaq Composite was within 2% of its record high from earlier in the year. Besides the steep V-shape of the Nasdaq's pattern over the last four months, the other aspect of the chart that stands out is just how steep the 50-day moving average is trending lately.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-50DMAa.png))**\n\n&gt; To illustrate just how steep the Nasdaq's 50-DMA has become, the chart below shows the daily percentage change of the 50-day going back to 1971. Currently, the Nasdaq 50-DMA is rising at an average of over 0.5% per day. That's an incredible slope and a level that has been exceeded only a handful of times in the Nasdaq's 50-year history.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-Composite1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Big Gains From Smaller Tech\n\n&gt; It's still difficult to fathom the moves in the US equity market over the last four months. The fact that the Nasdaq and more specifically the Technology sector aren't far from record highs is definitely something no one was expecting two months ago. There's an old market saying that equities take the stairs up and the elevator down, but in the latest market cycle, the elevator up was almost as fast as the way down!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Nasdaq.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Technology-Sector.png))**\n\n&gt; If you've been following the markets, all you've likely heard up until recently is that large-cap tech, and more specifically, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Facebook (FB), are single-handedly driving the market higher. The reality is not nearly as clear-cut. Given their market caps, the \"Big 5\" (as they're often referred to) have done a lot of heavy lifting, but in terms of performance, they're hardly the only game in town.\n\n&gt; The table below lists Technology sector stocks in the Russell 3000 with market caps of more than $1 billion that are outperforming all of the 'big 5' tech stocks on a YTD basis. Actually, since Amazon is doing so well relative to the rest of the \"big 5\" these are all stocks that are outperforming Amazon. If we looked for stocks that were doing better than the average return of the \"big 5\" the list would be a lot, lot longer (+16.4%).\n\n&gt; Looking through the list of names below, the two top-performing names are Zscaler (ZS) and Twilio (TWLO), which have both more than doubled. Behind these two, DocuSign (DOCU) and Sprout Social (SPT) are both knocking on the door of triple-digits. All 28 of the names listed have market caps of $1 billion, but the average market cap is just over $21 billion, while Nvidia (NVDA) is the largest company on the list with a market cap of $216 billion. For the most part, these aren't names that have been driving the indices, but anyone holding these stocks in their portfolio probably doesn't care!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Tech-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Best 50-Day Rally Ever\n\n&gt; In many ways, what we\u2019ve seen so far in 2020 has been both record-breaking and devastating. From the S&amp;P 500 Index peak on February 19 to the bear market lows March 23, stocks lost 33.9%. Now, 50 trading days later, stocks have gained 39.6%, for the largest 50-day rally since the S&amp;P 500 moved to 500 stocks in 1957.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere are no rollercoasters that can replicate what stocks have done so far in 2020,\u201d exclaimed LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHere\u2019s the catch though: Big 50-day rallies in the past have taken place near the start of new bull markets, and the returns going out a year were quite bullish.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 39.6% gain in 50 days was the greatest 50-day rally ever, besting the previous best in October 1982. What\u2019s important to note here is that many of these rallies took place coming off major market lows, and delivered quite strong returns going out 6 to 12 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/best-fifty-days.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Although we have near-term worries given this historic run, as some sentiment indicators such as put/call ratios are showing some froth, from a bigger picture perspective, this strong 50-day rally offers a reason to think stock prices may be even higher this time next year.\n\n*****\n\n# 2020 In Charts\n\n&gt; 2020 is only five months old, but in many ways it is one of the most historic years we\u2019ve ever seen. \u201c2020 went from moving along nicely, to seeing the worst recession in a generation and the fastest bear market ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cNow stocks are in the midst of one of the best bull runs ever, even though the economy remains extremely weak, thanks to record stimulus and hopes over a vaccine.\u201d\n&gt; \nTo best sum it all up, here are 10 charts that tell the picture of 2020 so far.\n\n&gt; 1.) The 2010s were the first decade in history to go all 10 years without a recession, which of course ended just months into the new decade, as the economy stopped. Stocks gained 13.5% on an annual basis last decade, surprisingly, only the third-best decade over the past four.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 2.) This is an election year, and the S&amp;P 500 Index hasn\u2019t been lower when a President is up for reelection since FDR in 1940. Although this seemed nearly impossible at the March lows, it is looking like this incredible streak could have a chance in 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 3.) One of the first signs something could go wrong in 2020 was stocks fell in January. Historically, this has meant potential trouble for the final 11 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 4.) As fears over COVID-19 gripped the world, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its fastest bear market ever, in only 19 days. To put this in perspective, this was the fastest bear market in the 124-year history of the Dow.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 5.) Mark Twain said \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes\u201d. Looking at history, every 50 years there has been a terrible pandemic and stocks fell more than 30%. We don\u2019t know if the ultimate lows are in this time, but so far, history is rhyming.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 6.) More than 20 million people in the US lost their jobs in April, while the unemployment rate soared to near 15%, the highest since the Great Depression. Record drops in manufacturing, industrial production, retail sales, and consumer spending have all taken place in the past two months as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 7.) A recession is here, ending the streak of 128 months in a row without one. What is unique about the previous expansion was nominal gross domestic product (GDP) grew only 50%, about the average growth seen during the previous expansions, but this expansion was nearly twice as long as the average expansion (10 years versus 5 years).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 8.) The bounce off of the March 23 S&amp;P 500 lows has been historic in many ways. In fact, it was one of the best 20-day rallies ever, with previous best rallies seeing strong returns 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 9.) As scary as it was on the way down, stocks have come roaring back, gaining more than 35% from the March 23 lows. This would classify as the greatest bear market bounce ever, which opens the question: is this more than a bear market bounce and instead the start of a new bull market?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 10.) The number of COVID-19 tests in the US nearly doubled in May versus what was seen in April. Additionally, fewer and fewer tests are coming back positive. Testing is one of the key ways we will beat this and this is a step in the right direction. We\u2019ve also seen new monthly lows in people on ventilators, in the ICU, and in hospitals.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Hard to believe, but there are still 7 months left in 2020. It hasn\u2019t been easy for any of us, and we continue to keep everyone impacted by this pandemic in mind, but we continue to see the glass as half full. The dual benefit of record monetary and fiscal policy should help create a bridge to help those most impacted, while the economy can slowly come back online later this year.\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$ADBE** \n&gt; * **$UNFI** \n&gt; * **$CHWY** \n&gt; * **$TIF** \n&gt; * **$LULU** \n&gt; * **$COUP** \n&gt; * **$SFIX** \n&gt; * **$LOVE** \n&gt; * **$NEPT** \n&gt; * **$GHM** \n&gt; * **$REVG** \n&gt; * **$GME** \n&gt; * **$HDS** \n&gt; * **$FIVE** \n&gt; * **$SIG** \n&gt; * **$CASY** \n&gt; * **$CVGW** \n&gt; * **$AMC** \n&gt; * **$FCEL** \n&gt; * **$QTNT** \n&gt; * **$PLCE** \n&gt; * **$CHS** \n&gt; * **$THO** \n&gt; * **$GCO** \n&gt; * **$BF.B** \n&gt; * **$LMNR** \n&gt; * **$WSG** \n&gt; * **$PRTY** \n&gt; * **$GES** \n&gt; * **$BBCP** \n&gt; * **$CONN** \n&gt; * **$HEXO** \n&gt; * **$PHR** \n&gt; * **$PVH** \n&gt; * **$RRGB** \n&gt; * **$PLAY** \n&gt; * **$TNP** \n&gt; * **$JW.A** \n&gt; * **$SB** \n&gt; * **$GSM** \n&gt; * **$SRT**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/bgPdMCr.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.8.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/d2EW1kr.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uxSiJJr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.9.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3SIjcG7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cRBrPlt.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.10.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DaheXAm.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9mcHxTl.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.11.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/i8SNjWM.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9xcBZPK.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.12.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Inc. $392.90\n&gt; **Adobe Inc.

        "selftext": "Dear Investors, \nFirst of all, I\u2019m new in this community and your advices already helped me to make a few good picks. So, I would like to share my first due diligence with you. \nI\u2019ve been holding and watching this stock for almost 2 years. Cypress Development (TSX-V: CYP) (OTCQB: CYDVF) is a Canadian mining company, that has one major project I\u2019m focusing on.\nThey have the mining rights for Clayton Valley Project totalling 5,430 acres. Their prefeasibility study showed a highly profitable Lithium reservoir in their claim (source: https://www.cypressdevelopmentcorp.com/news/2020/cypress-development-files-prefeasibility-study-for-clayton-valley-lithium-project-in-nevada/)\nKey facts of the prefeasibility study: \n\nAverage production rate of 15,000 tonnes per day to produce 27,400 tonnes lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) annually over a +40-year mine life.\n\nCapital cost estimate of US$493 million, pre-production, and operating cost estimate averaging US$3,329* per tonne LCE.\n\nAfter-tax net present value at an 8% discount rate (NPV-8%) of US$1.052 billion and an after-tax internal rate of return (IRR) of 25.8% based on a price of $9,500/tonne for lithium carbonate.\n\nProduction based on Probable Mineral Reserve of 222 million tonnes averaging 1,141 ppm Li (1.353 Mt LCE).\n\nMineral Reserves and production plan derived from Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources of 593 million tonnes averaging 1,073 ppm Li (3.387 Mt LCE).\n\nIndustry-low cash cost of US$3,329 per tonne LCE\n\nSo to sum up, they are sitting on a huge depot of lithium in Nevada, USA which has one of the mining-friendliest jurisdiction in the USA (source: https://investingnews.com/innspired/nevada-largest-gold-producer/). They already made a prefeasibility study, which examined the profitability of the claim. Their CEO is Dr. Bill Willoughby, a veteran of mining management, with 38 years of experience in the branch. Another person, who is visible for the public is their Corporate Communication manager Don Myers. He is often guest in mining related podcasts and also does (poor) social media management. \nIMPORTANT: What you don\u2019t read on their website, but what they said in a few podcasts is, that they probably won\u2019t do the lithium mining themselves. They will probably sell the mining rights to another, bigger mining company (can\u2019t provide source on that, you have to look after mining podcasts). \nTheir stock is currently at 0,20 CAD. \nNow for the opportunities/risks: \nOpportunity: \n\nLithium is used for the production of battery cells, especially in the electric car industry \n\nElectromobilty is a current megatrend and highly subsidized by the EU \n\nTesla has a battery production Gigafactory in Nevada (source https://www.tesla.com/gigafactory?redirect=no)\n\nThe price could go high, when they sell the mining rights\n\nAs we all know, Trump is a president, whos aim it is to make the USA more self-sufficient, maybe he will provide laws to make mining of essential material in the USA more profitable\n\n\u00a0\nRisks: \n\nThe stock had not had any bigger rises in the last years, despite good news\n\nSo\u2026 if you were reading this far, you now ask yourself the question: If the inner value is really that high, why is this still a pennystock? \nI can\u2019t answer that with full security. As we all know, the stock market is a psychological market (I\u2019m a psychologist myself, btw). That means the intrinsic value is not essential for the share price. In my opinion their corporate communication is just too bad and it\u2019s not really known. \nSo I\u2019m looking forward to your feedback. You can criticize me, but please be fair, it\u2019s my first DD to post in this forum and I\u2019m pretty new to investing.",

Imperial Oil (an integrated petroleum company majority-owned by Exxon-Mobil).\n\n* Why you should invest:\n\n1. Expectation of recovery in industrials which will lead to increased consumption of petroleum products.\n2.

P/E at 10.16, [integrated oil industry P/E average at 14.0](https://csimarket.com/Industry/Industry_Valuation.php?ind=603). Massively undervalued compared to the industry.\n4. While they suffered a loss of 188million in Q1 2020 due to the OPEC spat, they have sizable cash reserve of over 1.7billion dollars and a quick ratio of 1.05. They are equipped to survive for the long haul.\n5. If you're into dividends, they're still paying dividends all the way up to March at 0.76/share.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Risks:\n\n1. V-shape recovery turns into a L-shape recovery and it turns into a long winter.\n2. Continued tension between Saudi+ Russia and the US O&amp;G pushes oil back below breakeven price again [(approx- $36/bbl)](https://www.reuters.com/article/canada-energy-oilprice-idUSL2N0XE1D620150417)\n\nSource: [Financial Reports of Imperial Oil Corp](https://www.imperialoil.ca/-/media/Imperial/Files/Annual-and-quarterly-reports/2020_q1_interim_report.pdf)",

        "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI work in fine jewelry and time piece sales.\nAs a promotion, from time to time a brand that we carry will reward us with discounts or prizes or often times gift cards.\n\nIt\u2019s more of a fun side benefit they give us but I worked my butt off last year and managed to pull in $1500 in prepaid Visa gift cards.\n\nThese gift cards aren\u2019t meant to be used at any one particular store, they can be used anywhere that visa is excepted as if it were cash.\nUnfortunately I am unable to go to an ATM or bank and make a withdrawal in actual cash.\n\nAny advice on how to actually turn it into cash? Or possibly use this to somehow make me money in an investment?\n(My expenses are extremely low and I don\u2019t want to just use it as my grocery money for the next couple months, I\u2019d rather use my credit card for points and then pay it off immediately)\n\nI called one of those payday loan type places and they buy the cards but only at 50%. So that was a no-go.\nI even tried calling a buddy and asking if he would want one or a few of them in exchange at a 95% rate (he pays $95 for every hundred etc. etc.)\n\nOf course he thought I was scamming him somehow ha ha\n\nI would appreciate any thoughts or ideas before I just give up and end up using it as grocery money",

I got great tips, opened a td account, and put several thousand into some staple stocks. Microsoft, home depot, Visa, Mastercard, etc. Since then, I've seen my earnings climb quite a bit. Now that feels good and all, but honestly it begs more questions. Do I just hold for better gains? Do I buy more? Do I sell everything, quit my job, and enjoy life as a thousandaire? Not looking for granular advice, just general direction. Also curious if anyone is in a similar position.",

It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.

        "selftext": " \n\n&gt;**Investment managers say asset prices are too detached from harsh economic realities** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Hedge funds are getting ready for another slide in stock markets after growing uneasy that surging prices do not reflect the economic problems ahead.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Some managers fear that equity investors \u2014 used to buying the dips during the decade-long bull market that ended in March\u2019s sharp sell-off \u2014 have become too complacent about how quickly economies can recover from the pandemic and how effective stimulus packages from central banks and governments can be.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The S&amp;P 500 index completed its best 50-day run in history on Wednesday, said LPL Financial, closing within 8 per cent of its record high of mid-February.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cThe markets are priced to perfection,\u201d said Danny Yong, founding partner at hedge fund Dymon Asia Capital in Singapore. \u201cThe stability in equity markets does not reflect the job losses and the insolvencies ahead of us globally.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Mr Yong has been buying put options \u2014 which protect against market falls by allowing their owner to sell at a predetermined price \u2014 on stock indices and also on currencies sensitive to risk appetite such as the Australian dollar and the Korean won.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cI believe we will see new lows in global equity markets later this year,\u201d he added. \u201cAs March . . . has shown us, prices cannot diverge from fundamentals for too long.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Other hedge fund managers have expressed concerns about the sharp rebound in stocks from the March lows.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Stanley Druckenmiller, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of George Soros who stepped back from managing outside money a decade ago, recently said he expected a wave of bankruptcies and that a V-shaped economic recovery was a \u201cfantasy\u201d.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Paul Singer\u2019s Elliott Management, which has $40bn in assets, wrote in its most recent letter to investors that, since the impact of the economic downturn was greater than that of the 2008 financial crisis, \u201cour gut tells us that a 50 per cent or deeper decline from the February top might be the ultimate path of global stock markets\u201d.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The fund made money during the first-quarter crash from hedges in stocks and credit, and said it was trying to find new ways of protecting itself against another market fall after some hedges became more expensive.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Despite bleak economic data \u2014 including more than 40m Americans filing for unemployment benefits and an expected record contraction in the eurozone economy in the second quarter \u2014 the S&amp;P 500 has surged almost 40 per cent since its trough in March, leaving it down just 3 per cent for the year.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The index is now trading at more than 22 times expected earnings for the next 12 months, according to FactSet figures, taking the common valuation measure back to levels not seen since the early 2000s.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Mr Yong believes investors could soon discover that the so-called \u201cFed put\u201d \u2014 the concept that the central bank will step in to support markets \u2014 may be reaching its limits.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cSome people believe the Fed\u2019s unconventional measures are limitless but this is not the case,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's now about the \u201cTrump Put\u201d \u2014 how much more stimulus can he push through? I think he \\[President Donald Trump\\] will be constrained by Democrats in the House.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that its hedge-fund clients held a net short position of about $40bn in Euro Stoxx 50 futures.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Global macro hedge funds have sharply reduced their exposures to stocks this year, according to JPMorgan Cazenove.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cIt is entirely possible that there will be a fourth-quarter reckoning, where a second wave of job losses and a prolonged period of business failures tests equity sentiment,\u201d said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Francesco Filia, head of London-based hedge fund Fasanara Capital, is holding 70 per cent of his fund in cash and also using put options and other instruments to hedge his portfolio while he waits for a \u201csevere rupture\u201d in markets.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He sees threats in the trend towards \u201cdeglobalisation,\u201d which could drive inflation higher, and growing political interference in the technology sector, which could hurt shareholder returns.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He expects a potential \u201c2008-style . . . daily liquidity crisis\u201d as investors try to pull money from exchange traded funds that may not be able to meet those redemptions.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;However, many fund managers are reluctant to bet outright against stocks in the face of stimulus efforts from the US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, both of which have argued they have firepower in reserve.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The market hitting new lows \u201cis possible\u201d, said Tom Clarke, who has a low exposure to stocks at a macro fund at William Blair in London.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But he added that government and central bank stimulus packages have \u201ctaken on almost mythical proportions. There\u2019s no doubt in which direction policymakers want markets to go.\u201d",

        "selftext": "The Oracle of Omaha has a reputation as the gentle GOAT, but is there more to this than meets the eye?\n\nIs there something that is often overlooked?\n\nOr is this reputation warranted? (get it...warren, warranted?)\n\nAnyway...Let's begin...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe story begins in 1942, when Warren Buffet bought his first shares at the age of just 11. \n\nThis is same year that his father Howard Buffett ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in the Nebraska district.\n\nHe won, and became a member of Congress in 1943.\n\nBefore this, Howard worked at a small stock brokerage firm.\n\nHe was reelected twice. However, in 1952, he decided against seeking another term and returned to his investment business in Omaha,\u00a0Buffett-Falk &amp; Co., where he worked until shortly before his death in 1964.\n\nBut what about Warren Buffett?\n\nIn 1951, after graduating from Columbia, where he was taught by Benjamin Graham, Buffett worked for three years at his father's firm as an investment salesman. \n\nIn 1954, Buffett accepted a job at Benjamin Graham's partnership, working as a securities analyst.\n\nHis starting salary was $12,000 a year - the equivalent of $114,000 today.\n\nHowever, just two years later, Graham retired and Buffett started his own investment partnership.\n\nHe went to his father's acquaintances to raise Capital for his first fund. \n\nThese were prominent families in Nebraska with big businesses and political connections.\n\nFor example, across the street was the family whose son became the CEO of Coca Cola - that family gave him $10,000.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn 2012, the STOCK Act or The Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act was signed into law.\u00a0 \n\nThe law prohibits the use of non-public information for private profit, including insider trading by members of Congress and other government employees.\n\nRemember, Buffett's father used to be in Congress.\n\n***The only people who were, before 2012, allowed to trade on insider information without having criminal charges brought against them were congressmen.***\n\nRemember, Buffett's father was a stock market broker prior to being elected and going to Congress, hence he had a comprehensive knowledge of the stock market and clearly had an interest in it. \n\nAfter all, it was his father who taught Buffett the ropes early on and had him buy his first shares as an eleven year old.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImagine you are Warren Buffett, and you can:\n\n1). Get insider information to trade on it;\n\n2). Get a six-figure position after College;\n\n3). After a few years, set up your own fund, getting money from wealthy family friends;\n\n4). Pay no dividends to investors and only put a hundred bucks of your own money into the fund;\n\n5). Let the mathematics of compounding work its magic as you bring in more institutional money;\n\n6). Become so connected Politically and connected on Wall Street that you can get special deals, which have practically no risk as you know bailouts are coming. For example, in the 2008 crisis, Berkshire owned stock valued at more than $13 billion in the top recipients of the TARP funds, and Berkshire had at least twice as much dependence on bailed-out banks as any other large investor;\n\n7). Have billions of dollars on hand, remember you aren't paying any dividends to investors, ready for the inevitable economic recession to hit so that you can sweep up cheap assets;\n\n8). Be holier-than-thou (i.e. calling derivatives \"financial weapons of mass destruction\" when, during the height of the 2008 crisis, Berkshire sold more than $2.5 billion worth of credit default swaps. OR what about Buffett's reputation as the saviour in the Great Recession when Berkshire is the majority owner of Moody's, who played a key role in inflating the crisis in 2008 - via their questionable debt and derivative ratings which inflated the mortgage and subprime market).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat about Buffett's status as the GOAT?\n\n[Jim Simons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcy8QaILDJI) has a far superior track record.\n\nBillionaire Chamath Palihapitiya has even stated that [Jeff Bezos is the best investor of our generation](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/12/chamath-palihapitiya-amazons-jeff-bezos-the-best-investor-better-than-warren-buffett.html#:~:text=Chamath%20Palihapitiya%20calls%20Amazon's%20Jeff%20Bezos,investor%2C%20better%20than%20Warren%20Buffett&amp;text=%E2%80%9CPeople%20used%20to%20lambaste%20Jeff,said%20on%20%E2%80%9CSquawk%20Box.%E2%80%9D), not Warren Buffett.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBuffett has missed out on an entire raft of tech and Berkshire has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 in recent years.\n\nBerkshire's best years are found overwhelmingly in the period before the tech era.\n\nAlso, he has been critical of Bitcoin, describing it as \"rat poison squared\"\n\nUltimately, Buffett is worth $73 billion, he doesn't need to have an in-depth understanding of new age tech.\n\nMoreover, Buffett has a huge stake in Finance 1.0, why would he give props to Finance 2.0?\n\nBitcoin as a savings vehicle is misaligned with Berkshire's don't-save-money-invest-it-in-us or consume more of the products of the businesses that Berkshire has a huge stake in, and is also misaligned with Berkshire's Cantillon insider advantages.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's worth noting that Howard Buffett strongly supported the gold standard because he believed it would limit the ability of government to inflate the money supply and spend beyond its means. Here is a direct quote from Howard:\n\n***\"I warn you that politicians of both parties will oppose the restoration of gold, although they may outwardly seemingly favor it,\u00a0unless you are willing to surrender your children and your country to galloping inflation, war and slavery\u00a0then this cause demands your support. For if human liberty is to survive in America, we must win the battle to restore honest money. There is no more important challenge facing us than this issue -- the restoration of your freedom to secure gold in exchange for the fruits of your labors.\"***\n\nHis son Warren, however, hates gold. See the [Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs) as to why.\n\n**Some have even argued that Buffett's success can be summarised by the following:**\n\n**First Deals = Insider Information**\n\n**Last Deals = Cantillon Effect**\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nIs it true... or false?\n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UpTUBgUYgc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UpTUBgUYgc)",

Last month THE OTC DAILY Interviewed Greene Concepts President and CEO Lenny Greene &gt;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ1V5OHkQrg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ1V5OHkQrg)\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/otc-daily-interviews-greene-concepts-140500143.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/otc-daily-interviews-greene-concepts-140500143.html)\n\n**Highlights from the CEO Interview &gt;&gt;**\n\n**Size of the Bottling Plant:** The size of the plant is 60,000 square feet. The company can produce water for other companies via third-party (white-label) manufacturing. Many other companies without a plant may have revenues of up to $30 million per year.\n\n**Quality Benefits of BE WATERTM:** Greene Concepts offers clean, pristine natural spring artesian water in an area cherished by many other businesses because of the favorable water supply. The water holds numerous health benefits to include healthy joints and bones, teeth and tooth decay protection and balanced pH levels.\n\n**Company Valuation:** As of May 1, the company share price closed at .0015 with a current outstanding share count of 862 million equaling a market cap of $1,293,000 which is very undervalued compared to the $3.29 bottling plant asset on the books and the $10 million company valuation in 2018 without a bottling plant at the time and a higher outstanding share count of a billion shares.\n\n**Company Goals and Vision for Success Over the Next 6 - 12 Months:** Finalizing 15 unique deals and taking steps to grow and proliferate sales of our BE WATERTM line. We will continue to expand our white-label production. Greene Concepts can develop scientific formulations for itself and for other companies such as an immune CBD. The company has also developed a complete 24/7 beverage line aimed at providing multiple beverage types for consumers from sunup to sundown. The company anticipates a future up listing to NASDAQ in the future for a win-win for everyone as strong sales begin and continue to take shape.\n\n**About the Company:** \n\nGreene Concepts owns and operates a bottling plant located in Marion, NC valued at $3.29 million which sources water directly from seven different spring and artesian water wells. The bottling plant's capacity is 8 million cases and 192 million individual units.\n\n$INKW",

Imperial Oil (an integrated petroleum company majority-owned by Exxon-Mobil).\n\n* Why you should invest:\n\n1. Expectation of recovery in industrials which will lead to increased consumption of petroleum products.\n2.

While they suffered a loss of 188million in Q1 2020 due to the OPEC spat, they have sizable cash reserve of over 1.7billion dollars and a quick ratio of 1.05. They are equipped to survive for the long haul.\n5. If you're into dividends, they're still paying dividends all the way up to March at 0.76/share.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Risks:\n\n1. V-shape recovery turns into a L-shape recovery and it turns into a long winter.\n2.

        "selftext": "The firm founded by famous bear Jeremy Grantham is worried equities are looking expensive as investors underestimate the coming hit to earnings. \n\nIf there\u2019s one number that Ben Inker is finding particularly hard to wrap his head around amid the COVID crisis, it\u2019s this one \u2013 6 per cent.\n\nThat is the amount by which analysts expect Wall Street\u2019s earnings per share to fall in the fourth quarter of 2020 from a year earlier.\n\nJust 6 per cent. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s how mild the market expects the impact of the biggest global economic hit in a generation to actually be.\n\n\u201cThe fourth quarter in 2019 was one of the best quarters ever for large companies,\u201d Inker tells Chanticleer from his home in Massachusetts, sounding more than a little incredulous.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether investors believe the forecasts they are looking at. I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to take it for the market to wake up to reality. And I don\u2019t know exactly what reality is going to look like.\u201d\n\nBut what he does know is that he\u2019s nervous.\n\nInker is the head of asset allocation at GMO, the firm founded by legendary British investor Jeremy Grantham, who is credited with warning of Japan\u2019s sharemarket bubble in the 1980s, the tech bubble in the early 2000s, and the conditions that led to the global financial crisis (GFC).\n\nA bit of the inherent scepticism of the investors they call the Perma Bear naturally flows through the value-oriented GMO and it\u2019s no surprise that the sharp rally in US equities \u2013 the S&amp;P 500 is now up 36.5 per cent since the market\u2019s low on March 23 \u2013 has forced Inker\u2019s hand.\n\nSo in the midst of the fastest bull market in history, GMO is retreating from equities.\n\n\nJeremy Grantham's GMO fund is pulling back on equities. Domino Postiglione\n\nFor its un-correlated funds (which don\u2019t use a benchmark to measure relative returns) Inker has reduced the net equity exposure to 25 per cent from 55 per cent. The equity exposure of benchmarked funds has been cut in a similar, albeit smaller way. Grantham is completely behind the decisions.\n\n\u201cThis was a big move for us and makes our portfolios look very different to most big portfolios,\u201d Inker explains. \u201cWhich is a scary thing to do.\u201d\n\nBut he says his team was guided by the simple principle that they wouldn\u2019t invest their own money in the market at these levels.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d rather take the risk of looking stupid than \u2026 be in a position where we lost the clients 30 per cent or 40 per cent because the equity market took another leg down.\u201d\n\nInker acknowledges that GMO, which reportedly manages about $80 billion, has had a difficult year, like many investors. Its value orientation meant it underperformed the market as it went down, but Inker says the firm\u2019s funds have largely kept up with the rally, which has limited absolute losses.\n\nGMO increased its equities position when the market was down 30 per cent in mid March, believing stocks were fairly prices for a downturn that would be about twice the severity of the GFC.\n\nWhere GDP fell 3.25 per cent during that period and took seven quarters to reach a new high, GMO expected the COVID-19 crisis to wipe between 6 per cent and 6.5 per cent from GDP, which would not be back to the new high until the end of 2021.\n\nAs such, GMO was banking on steady returns over the course of several years from its equities bet. What it got was what Inker describes as \u201ca monumental rally\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe got the returns we were expecting, we just got them an awful lot faster than we were expecting. And that started to make us nervous.\u201d\n\nGMO\u2019s view is that it is dealing with incredible uncertainty caused by \u201ca virus of which the world has a grand total of five months of experience\u201d and it cannot make post-rally stock valuations, even in the most optimistic of scenarios.\n\nSmall business key to cashflows\nYes, the Federal Reserve has taken incredible, and Inker argues justified, steps to save companies that would have otherwise become bankrupt through no real fault of their own.\n\nBut he doesn\u2019t believe it can stop the hit to earnings that will arrive when the US government\u2019s massive but limited stimulus runs out. \u201cAs we see it, the Federal Reserve can do a lot to help investor confidence, but it can do little to help corporate cashflow.\u201d\n\nThe big problem is small business. The business models of many retailers and restaurants won\u2019t work if they\u2019re only allowed to operate at a percentage of their pre-crisis capacity. Those small businesses employ a lot of people, and it will take a long time for laid of workers to get new jobs. That surge in unemployment can\u2019t help but hit corporate cashflow.\n\nInker faced another problem in retreating from equities \u2013 cash offered now risk, but also no reward.\n\nHis two bets are on emerging market stocks and particularly value stocks.\n\nIf GMO is wrong about the economy, and the recovery is V-shaped, then these value stocks should do well. And if the downturn is prolonged and ugly, Inker thinks he can still win.\n\n\u201cWe think we do have a pretty nice margin of safety here. Value stocks can withstand quite a bad economic outcome and still outperform over the next several years because there just so much cheaper.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.afr.com/chanticleer/rally-leaves-jeremy-grantham-s-gmo-nervous-20200602-p54ym8",

        "selftext": "Today we'll be taking a look through [PwC\u2019s Global Artificial Intelligence Study](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/data-and-analytics/publications/artificial-intelligence-study.html).\n\nLet's get started.\n\n**Part 1/6 - Overall impact of AI:**\n\nThe first real takeaway of the report is just how big of a game changer AI is likely to be, and how much potential value is up for grabs.\n\n***Global GDP could be up to 14% higher in 2030 as a result of AI, according to PwC research.***\n\nThis is the equivalent of an additional $15.7 trillion, therefore making it the biggest commercial opportunity in today's rapidly evolving economy.\n\nFor some context, this is more than the current GDP of Japan, Germany, India and the UK *combined*.\n\nBut what are the main drivers of this immense economic impact?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Part 2/6 - Productivity gains:**\n\nIn the near-term, the biggest potential economic uplift from AI is likely to come from improved productivity.\n\nThis includes the automation of routine tasks, augmenting employees' capabilities and freeing them up to focus on more stimulating and higher-value-adding work.\n\n***As many of their operational processes are highly susceptible to automation, capital-intensive sectors such as manufacturing and transport are likely to see the largest productivity gains from AI.***\n\nIn an increasingly competitive business environment, the impact on productivity could be transformative, and businesses that fail to adapt could quickly find themselves undercut on turnaround times as well as costs.\n\nTherefore, they stand to lose a significant amount of their market share as a result.\n\nOver the period from 2017-2030, labour productivity improvements are expected to account for over 55% of all GDP gains from AI.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Part 3/6 - Consumer Demand:**\n\nEventually, the GDP uplift from product enhancements and subsequent shifts in consumer demand, behaviour and consumption emanating from AI will overtake the productivity gains, potentially delivering more than $9 trillion of additional GDP in 2030.\n\nConsumers will be mostly attracted to higher quality and more personalised products and services.\n\n***This increased consumption creates a virtuous cycle of more data touch-points and hence more data, better insights, better products and hence more consumption.***\n\nThe consumer revolution set off by AI opens the way for massive disruption as both established businesses and new entrants drive innovation and develop new business models. \n\nAI front-runners will have the advantage of superior customer insight.\n\nThe immediate competitive benefits include an improved ability to tap into consumer preferences, tailor their output to match these individual demands and, in doing so, capture an ever bigger slice of the market.\n\nMoreover, the front-runners' ability to shape product developments around this rich supply of consumer data will make it increasingly difficult for slower moving competitors to keep pace.\n\nProvided they execute well, it is likely that the front-runners will have an unassailable advantage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Part 4/6 - Destruction...but opportunity:**\n\nIn terms of job losses from automation, the report makes the argument that new jobs will be created by the shifts in productivity and consumer demand emanating from AI, and through the value chain of AI itself.\n\nIn addition to new types of workers who will focus on thinking creatively about how AI can be developed and applied, a new set of personnel will be required to build, maintain, operate, and regulate these emerging technologies.\n\nAll of this will facilitate the creation of new jobs that would not have existed in a world without AI.\n\n***Although I agree that AI will result in the creation in new jobs, and differentiated skill sets such as creativity will be imperative moving forwards, I think it's likely that we will see a winner takes all economy, whereby the businesses who 'win' will employ more people, however their competitors will be forced to dramatically reduce their workforce and*** [***the overall trend will be destructive in nature***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nFbKzt-uwE)***.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Part 5/6 - Impact on different regions:**\n\nSome economies have the potential to gain more than others in both absolute and relative terms.\n\nChina and North America are likely to see the biggest impact.\n\nIn North America, the potential uplift to GDP from AI will be amplified by the huge opportunities to introduce more productive technologies, many of which are ready to be applied. \n\n***These gains will be accelerated by the advanced technological and consumer readiness for AI, along with the impact of rapid accumulation of assets \u2013 not just technology, but data touch-points and the flows of information and customer insight that come with them.***\n\nIn terms of China, the high proportion of Chinese GDP that comes from manufacturing heightens the potential uplift from introducing more productive technologies. \n\nIt is likely to take some time to build up the technology and expertise needed to implement these capabilities and therefore the GDP boost won\u2019t be as rapid as the US. But by 2030, the productivity gains in China could begin to pull ahead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Part 6/6 - Sector analysis:**\n\nThe report then looks at the potential impact of AI on different sectors.\n\nIt provides Scores based on PwC\u2019s AI impact index evaluation. Potential scores range from 1-5, with 5 indicating the highest potential impact due to AI, and 1 being the lowest.\n\nLet's look at the top three sectors where AI is expected to have the highest potential impact.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**In first place is Healthcare, with a score of 3.7**\n\nThe three areas with the biggest AI potential are:\n\nDetecting small variations from the baseline in patients' health data to support diagnosis\n\nEarly identification of potential pandemics.\n\nand imaging diagnostics (i.e. radiology)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe benefits here are obvious: faster and more accurate diagnoses, which would allow for earlier intervention, and more personalised treatment.\n\nIn terms of timeframe, medical insurance and smarter scheduling is ready to go.\n\nIn the medium term, data-driven diagnostics and virtual drug development are in the works.\n\nLonger term, there could be robot doctors carrying out diagnosis and treatment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA key barrier to overcome is the concern over the privacy and protection of sensitive health data. Also, more advanced applications (i.e. intelligent implants) will take some time to reach their potential and gain acceptance from patients, healthcare providers and regulators.\n\n***They then touch on a use case with massive potential: data-based diagnostic support***\n\n***This involves AI-powered diagnostics, which use the patient's unique history as a baseline against which small deviations flag a possible health condition in need of further investigation and treatment.***\n\nAlthough this will initially be adopted as an aid, the accuracy of the AI system will improve over time and long term it could operate autonomously.\n\nIt's worth noting that the global healthcare market is expected to reach $11.9 trillion by 2022, so whoever executes well here is going to be pretty high up on the Forbes List.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**In second place is the automotive sector, with another score of 3.7**\n\nHowever, it is ranked second as Healthcare is further along in terms of adoption in the long-term, and it is in the long term technologies where the greatest impact lies.\n\nThe three areas with the biggest AI potential are:\n\nAutonomous fleets for ride sharing\n\nSemi-autonomous features such as driver assist\n\nand engine monitoring and predictive, autonomous maintenance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe main benefit to consumers will be 'on demand' flexibility.\n\nReady to go:\u00a0Automated driver assistance systems (e.g. parking assist, lane centering, adaptive cruise control etc.).\n\nIn terms of timeframe, automated driver assistance systems are ready to go.\n\nIn the medium term, there could be on-demand parts manufacturing and maintenance.\n\nLonger term, there is the possibility of engine monitoring and predictive, autonomous maintenance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***The tech still needs development, for example it is more challenging to get an autonomous vehicle to perform safely under extreme weather conditions. Even then, it needs to gain consumer trust and regulatory acceptance.***\n\nAutonomous fleets for ride sharing is the high potential use case; this would allow people to access the vehicle they need at that point, and would be more efficient than the current system.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**In third place is the Financial Services sector, with a score of 3.3**\n\nThe three areas with the biggest AI potential are:\n\nPersonalised financial planning\n\nFraud detection and anti-money laundering\n\nand Process automation, which would apply to both back office and customer facing operations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor consumers, this would offer a more customised solution that would be integrated with others areas of their life.\n\nIn terms of timeframe, robo-advice, automated insurance underwriting and robotic process automation in areas such as finance and compliance is ready to go.\n\nIn the medium term, there could be optimised product design based on consumer preferences.\n\nLonger term, moving from anticipating what will happen (i.e. predictive analytics) to proactively shaping the outcome (i.e. prescriptive analytics) could reduce accident rates or improve consumer outcomes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe main barriers to overcome are consumer trust and regulatory acceptance.\n\n***Undoubtedly, personalised financial planning is a high potential use case - AI could allow clients to manage their finances dynamically to match their goals.***\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwTHGDDHMPc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwTHGDDHMPc)",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 8th, 2020.\n\n# **Look for the S&amp;P 500 to turn positive for the year with a boost from the Fed in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/05/look-for-the-sp-500-to-turn-positive-for-the-year-with-a-boost-from-the-fed-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to reassure markets next week the central bank will do whatever it takes to help the economy heal. That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting is the big event for markets in the coming week. There are a few economic reports, including inflation data, the consumer price index Wednesday and producer prices Thursday. Weekly jobless claims will be important Thursday to see if there\u2019s a drop in continuing clams, after May\u2019s employment report showed a surprising record gain of 2.5 million jobs.\n*****\n&gt; The reopening trade was in full swing in the past week, especially Friday when stocks surged on the jobs report, which was expected to show a loss of 8.3 million jobs. The Nasdaq broke above its record high set on Feb. 19, and the S&amp;P 500 was just 1.1% away from turning positive for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Even before the jobs report, investors were loading up on financials, industrials, transports and small caps, which were up more than 8% for the week and 18.4% in the past month. S&amp;P financials were 12.1% higher on the week, S&amp;P industrials were up 10.5, and the NYSE airline index jumped more than 35.4.%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think next week is dominated by the reopening and it will be for another month,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. \u201cWith cyclicals outperforming, small [caps] outperforming, credit spreads coming in and then the bond yields going up, everybody \u2014 all facets of the financial markets \u2014 are sort of suggesting the same outcome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 3,193, a gain of 4.9%, and now traders are watching to see if it can scale the psychological 3,200 level. The Dow closed Friday at 27,110, up 6.8% for the week, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.4%, at 9,814 after reaching an intraday record high of 9,845 Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts say the market will likely look past the protests that broke out in cities across the U.S. after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Four policemen were charged with murder in his death. Looters joined the protests, some of which turned violent, but they quieted down towards the end of the week.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher for a third week in a row, but a change this past week has been the abrupt lurch higher in Treasury yields. The 10-year rose to a high of 0.95% Friday, a quarter-point move in just three sessions. The move was already underway but got a lift Wednesday when ADP jobs data was not nearly as bad as expected. Yields ripped even higher after the May employment report showed the unemployment rate actually fell to 13.3%, instead of climbing to 20%, as expected by economists.\n*****\n&gt; Bond strategists said the Treasury market was now acknowledging the potential for a recovery, but not in the exuberant way the stock market has been. Since March 23, the S&amp;P 500 has risen more than 45%, but it took the 10-year Treasury until this week to get back the yield level it was at when stocks bottomed.\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen said he believes a new bull market has been launched, but there could be pullbacks and some headwinds for the market coming up.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhen GDP is minus 30%, other issues don\u2019t matter. There\u2019s just one issue. But as the economy reopens again, the trade battles will matter again, presidential politics will matter again,\u201d said Paulsen, adding the budget deficit could also matter. \u201cI think we\u2019ll get removed from a sole focus. That isn\u2019t quite there but I think it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed begins its two-day meeting Tuesday, and will release its statement Wednesday afternoon, followed by a video briefing by Powell.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhey would the Fed want to disrupt this with anything?\u201d Paulsen said. \u201cThey\u2019re still going to support the economy. They\u2019re going to stay away from negative rates or yield curve management. They\u2019re not going to do anything to scare the markets. They might certainly reassure people that they are still ready to provide support.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America, said the Fed may clarify where it stands on some of the extraordinary moves it has taken since it cut rates to zero. The Fed has been supporting the markets with asset purchases and multiple programs for commercial paper, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds, for example.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe think right now they\u2019re just trying to get this Main Street lending program to work. The question is are they going to do more things around what they do in terms of forward guidance and next steps of macro easing,\u201d Harris said.\n*****\n&gt; There has been speculation that the Fed would do some type of so-called yield curve control, a program to keep interest rates capped at certain levels. \u201cI think it\u2019s too early for that,\u201d said Harris. He said the Fed would be guaranteeing low rates for a long period of time if it does yield curve control.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYield curve control is basically open-ended quantitative easing,\u201d he said. The Fed is currently buying Treasurys but if it wanted to stop yields from rising too much as the economy improves, it could make targeted purchases.\n*****\n&gt; Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said it\u2019s possible the Fed could announce the yield curve control. \u201cWe\u2019ve said they could implement yield curve control out to three years,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my mind that matches the length of the horizon of the economic projections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Powell has said the economy needs more fiscal help, and he could reiterate those comments Wednesday. President Donald Trump on Friday said he backs more stimulus. So far, the Democrats have put out a marker with their wish list for further spending, but there have been no negotiations.\n*****\n&gt; There was concern the strong jobs report could make it harder to get buy in for another big spending package. But some economists say the recovery needs a boost and states need funding to fill the holes in their budgets from coronavirus-related spending and a lack of tax receipts.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7klaXQm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PKTBzT2.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/a5JkAB6.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/M2x4Qoq.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qtJYfXN.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bjiJWjV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UAi19KJ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GQm4ruO.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uV1U7FN.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/wm2XJND.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yarkiMO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hFblu2G.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Stocks Outpacing Analyst Price Targets\n\n&gt; This morning's jobs report shocked the financial world -- most notably the economists whose job it is to provide estimates. The consensus estimate among economists for May nonfarm payrolls was projecting a loss of more than 7 million jobs. The actual number that was reported did not just show a smaller than expected job loss, but it actually showed a gain in jobs of more than 2.5 million.\n\n&gt; We're seeing a similar situation play out in the equity analyst community. With the S&amp;P 500 now up 40%+ since its low less than three months ago, the average stock in the index is now trading above its consensus analyst price target that looks 12 months out. Analysts have simply not been able to catch up to the rapid rise we've seen for equity prices.\n\n&gt; It's extremely rare to see share prices move above consensus analyst price targets. We don't have the historical daily data on this, but anecdotally we can't remember a time when the spread has been this wide. As shown below, at the end of 2019 when the S&amp;P finished a massive rally, equity prices were 5.5% below the consensus price target. That was seen as a very tight spread prior to what we're seeing now. At the lows in March, the average share price had dropped all the way to $92.50 compared to an average consensus price target of $143.20. That projected a gain of 54.9% at the time!\n\n&gt; Since March 23rd, the average share price has risen from $92.50 up to $138.40, while the average analyst price target has fallen from $143.20 to $136. Current price targets no longer project a gain for the average S&amp;P 500 stock, but rather a 1.7% drop.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/avgpricetarget.png))**\n\n&gt; # Nasdaq's Historical Run\n\n&gt; At its highs earlier this morning, the Nasdaq Composite was within 2% of its record high from earlier in the year. Besides the steep V-shape of the Nasdaq's pattern over the last four months, the other aspect of the chart that stands out is just how steep the 50-day moving average is trending lately.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-50DMAa.png))**\n\n&gt; To illustrate just how steep the Nasdaq's 50-DMA has become, the chart below shows the daily percentage change of the 50-day going back to 1971. Currently, the Nasdaq 50-DMA is rising at an average of over 0.5% per day. That's an incredible slope and a level that has been exceeded only a handful of times in the Nasdaq's 50-year history.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-Composite1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Big Gains From Smaller Tech\n\n&gt; It's still difficult to fathom the moves in the US equity market over the last four months. The fact that the Nasdaq and more specifically the Technology sector aren't far from record highs is definitely something no one was expecting two months ago. There's an old market saying that equities take the stairs up and the elevator down, but in the latest market cycle, the elevator up was almost as fast as the way down!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Nasdaq.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Technology-Sector.png))**\n\n&gt; If you've been following the markets, all you've likely heard up until recently is that large-cap tech, and more specifically, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Facebook (FB), are single-handedly driving the market higher. The reality is not nearly as clear-cut. Given their market caps, the \"Big 5\" (as they're often referred to) have done a lot of heavy lifting, but in terms of performance, they're hardly the only game in town.\n\n&gt; The table below lists Technology sector stocks in the Russell 3000 with market caps of more than $1 billion that are outperforming all of the 'big 5' tech stocks on a YTD basis. Actually, since Amazon is doing so well relative to the rest of the \"big 5\" these are all stocks that are outperforming Amazon. If we looked for stocks that were doing better than the average return of the \"big 5\" the list would be a lot, lot longer (+16.4%).\n\n&gt; Looking through the list of names below, the two top-performing names are Zscaler (ZS) and Twilio (TWLO), which have both more than doubled. Behind these two, DocuSign (DOCU) and Sprout Social (SPT) are both knocking on the door of triple-digits. All 28 of the names listed have market caps of $1 billion, but the average market cap is just over $21 billion, while Nvidia (NVDA) is the largest company on the list with a market cap of $216 billion. For the most part, these aren't names that have been driving the indices, but anyone holding these stocks in their portfolio probably doesn't care!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Tech-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Best 50-Day Rally Ever\n\n&gt; In many ways, what we\u2019ve seen so far in 2020 has been both record-breaking and devastating. From the S&amp;P 500 Index peak on February 19 to the bear market lows March 23, stocks lost 33.9%. Now, 50 trading days later, stocks have gained 39.6%, for the largest 50-day rally since the S&amp;P 500 moved to 500 stocks in 1957.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere are no rollercoasters that can replicate what stocks have done so far in 2020,\u201d exclaimed LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHere\u2019s the catch though: Big 50-day rallies in the past have taken place near the start of new bull markets, and the returns going out a year were quite bullish.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 39.6% gain in 50 days was the greatest 50-day rally ever, besting the previous best in October 1982. What\u2019s important to note here is that many of these rallies took place coming off major market lows, and delivered quite strong returns going out 6 to 12 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/best-fifty-days.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Although we have near-term worries given this historic run, as some sentiment indicators such as put/call ratios are showing some froth, from a bigger picture perspective, this strong 50-day rally offers a reason to think stock prices may be even higher this time next year.\n\n*****\n\n# 2020 In Charts\n\n&gt; 2020 is only five months old, but in many ways it is one of the most historic years we\u2019ve ever seen. \u201c2020 went from moving along nicely, to seeing the worst recession in a generation and the fastest bear market ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cNow stocks are in the midst of one of the best bull runs ever, even though the economy remains extremely weak, thanks to record stimulus and hopes over a vaccine.\u201d\n&gt; \nTo best sum it all up, here are 10 charts that tell the picture of 2020 so far.\n\n&gt; 1.) The 2010s were the first decade in history to go all 10 years without a recession, which of course ended just months into the new decade, as the economy stopped. Stocks gained 13.5% on an annual basis last decade, surprisingly, only the third-best decade over the past four.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 2.) This is an election year, and the S&amp;P 500 Index hasn\u2019t been lower when a President is up for reelection since FDR in 1940. Although this seemed nearly impossible at the March lows, it is looking like this incredible streak could have a chance in 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 3.) One of the first signs something could go wrong in 2020 was stocks fell in January. Historically, this has meant potential trouble for the final 11 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 4.) As fears over COVID-19 gripped the world, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its fastest bear market ever, in only 19 days. To put this in perspective, this was the fastest bear market in the 124-year history of the Dow.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 5.) Mark Twain said \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes\u201d. Looking at history, every 50 years there has been a terrible pandemic and stocks fell more than 30%. We don\u2019t know if the ultimate lows are in this time, but so far, history is rhyming.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 6.) More than 20 million people in the US lost their jobs in April, while the unemployment rate soared to near 15%, the highest since the Great Depression. Record drops in manufacturing, industrial production, retail sales, and consumer spending have all taken place in the past two months as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 7.) A recession is here, ending the streak of 128 months in a row without one. What is unique about the previous expansion was nominal gross domestic product (GDP) grew only 50%, about the average growth seen during the previous expansions, but this expansion was nearly twice as long as the average expansion (10 years versus 5 years).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 8.) The bounce off of the March 23 S&amp;P 500 lows has been historic in many ways. In fact, it was one of the best 20-day rallies ever, with previous best rallies seeing strong returns 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 9.) As scary as it was on the way down, stocks have come roaring back, gaining more than 35% from the March 23 lows. This would classify as the greatest bear market bounce ever, which opens the question: is this more than a bear market bounce and instead the start of a new bull market?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 10.) The number of COVID-19 tests in the US nearly doubled in May versus what was seen in April. Additionally, fewer and fewer tests are coming back positive. Testing is one of the key ways we will beat this and this is a step in the right direction. We\u2019ve also seen new monthly lows in people on ventilators, in the ICU, and in hospitals.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Hard to believe, but there are still 7 months left in 2020. It hasn\u2019t been easy for any of us, and we continue to keep everyone impacted by this pandemic in mind, but we continue to see the glass as half full. The dual benefit of record monetary and fiscal policy should help create a bridge to help those most impacted, while the economy can slowly come back online later this year.\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$ADBE** \n&gt; * **$CHWY** \n&gt; * **$TIF** \n&gt; * **$LULU** \n&gt; * **$COUP** \n&gt; * **$SFIX** \n&gt; * **$LOVE** \n&gt; * **$NEPT** \n&gt; * **$GHM** \n&gt; * **$REVG** \n&gt; * **$GME** \n&gt; * **$HDS** \n&gt; * **$FIVE** \n&gt; * **$SIG** \n&gt; * **$CASY** \n&gt; * **$CVGW** \n&gt; * **$AMC** \n&gt; * **$FCEL** \n&gt; * **$QTNT** \n&gt; * **$PLCE** \n&gt; * **$CHS** \n&gt; * **$THO** \n&gt; * **$GCO** \n&gt; * **$BF.B** \n&gt; * **$LMNR** \n&gt; * **$WSG** \n&gt; * **$PRTY** \n&gt; * **$GES** \n&gt; * **$BBCP** \n&gt; * **$CONN** \n&gt; * **$HEXO** \n&gt; * **$PHR** \n&gt; * **$PVH** \n&gt; * **$RRGB** \n&gt; * **$PLAY** \n&gt; * **$TNP** \n&gt; * **$JW.A** \n&gt; * **$SB** \n&gt; * **$GSM** \n&gt; * **$SRT**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/bgPdMCr.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.8.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/d2EW1kr.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uxSiJJr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.9.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3SIjcG7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cRBrPlt.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.10.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DaheXAm.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9mcHxTl.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.11.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/i8SNjWM.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9xcBZPK.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.12.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Inc. $392.90\n&gt; **Adobe Inc.

        "selftext": " [https://oracledispatch.com/2020/06/01/gearing-up-for-the-pot-stock-election-run-mjna-crlbf-mctc-curlf/](https://oracledispatch.com/2020/06/01/gearing-up-for-the-pot-stock-election-run-mjna-crlbf-mctc-curlf/) \n\n \n\nThe 2016 general election November vote was one of the biggest catalysts for the cannabis space. 2020 is shaping as potentially another similar situation, with 4 states already on the ballot for legalization (2 for recreational) and another 6 states pushing to get on the ballot (5 for recreational), making it potentially even more explosive for the overall legalization movement than we saw in the historic 2016 process.\n\nThe rationalization for this last claim is about percentage change: the ultimate shift would be to get cannabis legalized on a recreational basis in the majority of the US, thereby putting pressure on the federal government to accept the verdict by states and start removing federal statutes around cannabis, which would likely accelerate the dominoes as a \u201ctipping point\u201d phenomenon.\n\nIn percentage terms, if all states seeking to get on the ballot for recreational \u201cadult use\u201d legalization are successful in doing so, then 2020 will be a bigger shift (provided they all pass) than the movement in 2016.\n\nIn other words, start getting your pot stock portfolio picks together ASAP. Below you will find our thoughts and analysis on some of the more widely discussed names in the space, including: Medical Marijuana Inc (OTCMKTS:MJNA), CRLBF, MCTC Holdings Inc (OTCMKTS:MCTC) aka Cannabis Global Inc. (OTCMKTS:MCTC), and CURLF\n\n**Medical Marijuana Inc (OTCMKTS:MJNA)** isn\u2019t what we would consider a \u201cprime investment pick\u201d in this space. The company has remained on the pink sheets, offering up unaudited financials only for all of its tenure as a publicly traded stock (and we\u2019re talking about years here), despite claiming tens of millions in revenues. In case you\u2019re wondering, this is not remotely typical. As far as we can tell, MJNA is the only stock in the history of the world that fits this description. And it\u2019s certainly not a reassuring idea. Why would you hide on the pink sheets and avoid producing audited financial reports if you are seeing such success?\n\nTo underscore this, the stock has done nothing but slide lower despite the company\u2019s proclamations of ever-growing revenues. Smoke equals fire. We would simply be careful with any company that seems to overpromise and overhype, and then claim the opaque lack of transparency afforded to companies trading on the pink sheets. While we have seen a recent spike following news that Aurora bought out a CBD name (CBD is the main focus of MJNA), we would remain skeptical that the long history here of underperformance in MJNA is likely to change on a sustained basis anytime soon.\n\nMedical Marijuana Inc (OTCMKTS:MJNA) bills itself as an investment holding company that operates in the medical marijuana and industrial hemp markets. Its products range from patented and proprietary based cannabinoid products to seed and stalk or isolated high value extracts manufactured and formulated for the pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and cosmeceutical industries. The company licenses its proprietary testing, genetics, labeling and packaging, tracking, production, and standardization methods for the medicinal cannabinoid industry.\n\nIt engages in the research and development of cannabinoid-based pharmaceuticals; and marketing and distribution of cannabidiol hemp oil-based products. In addition, the company provides management support and services to cooperatives, collectives, health and wellness facilities, and medical clinics; and consulting and securities services to businesses and individuals in the legal cannabis industry.\n\nIt\u2019s subsidiary, Kannaway, is a network sales and marketing company specializing in the sales and marketing of hemp-based botanical products. Kannaway currently hosts weekly online sales meetings and conferences across the United States, offering unique insight and opportunity to sales professionals who are desirous of becoming successful leaders in the sale and marketing of hemp-based botanical products.\n\nMJNA has been acting well over recent days, up something like 30% in that time. Shares of the stock have powered higher over the past month, rallying roughly 75% in that time on strong overall action.\n\nMedical Marijuana Inc (OTCMKTS:MJNA) managed to rope in revenues totaling $16.9M in overall sales during the company\u2019s most recently reported quarterly financial data \u2014 a figure that represents a rate of top line growth of -4.2%, as compared to year-ago data in comparable terms. In addition, the company is battling some balance sheet hurdles, with cash levels struggling to keep up with current liabilities ($6.2M against $11M, respectively).\n\n**Cresco Labs Inc (OTCMKTS:CRLBF)** continues to act like a new leader in the making, with an expanding footprint in terms of market density and geographic range.\n\nMoreover, this is a company very much tied to the process of gradual legalization in the US marketplace, with a widely known brand and a growing scale in terms of distribution relationships.\n\nCresco Labs Inc (OTCMKTS:CRLBF) trumpets itself as a company that manufactures and sells medical cannabis products in the United States. It offers cannabis dry flower; vaporizer forms of cannabis; cannabis oil in capsule, oral and sublingual solutions; cannabis in topical; and other cannabis products.\n\nThe company also provides cannabis infused edibles, including chocolate and toffee confections, fruit-forward gummies, and hard sweet and chews. Cresco Labs Inc. sells its products under the Cresco brand. In addition, it operators a Hope Heal Health dispensary in Fall River, Bristol County, Massachusetts.\n\nIf you\u2019re long this stock, then you\u2019re liking how the stock has responded to the announcement. CRLBF shares have been moving higher over the past week overall, pushing about 8% to the upside on above average trading volume. Shares of the stock have powered higher over the past month, rallying roughly 24% in that time on strong overall action.\n\nCresco Labs Inc (OTCMKTS:CRLBF) generated sales of $54.6M, according to information released in the company\u2019s most recent quarterly financial report. That adds up to a sequential quarter-over-quarter growth rate of 14.2% on the top line. In addition, the company is battling some balance sheet hurdles, with cash levels struggling to keep up with current liabilities ($70.2M against $194.7M, respectively).\n\n**MCTC Holdings Inc (OTCMKTS:MCTC)**, now doing business as Cannabis Global, Inc. (MCTC), has started to emerge as a new focus point for cannabis stock traders in the past few weeks. The company has been an IP leader, with a number of major patents related primarily to infusion technology for CBD, THC, CBG, and THC-V in the works. It\u2019s rare to see substantive IP as a factor in the pot stock space \u2013 most of these names are basically commodity plays \u2013 but MCTC appears to be the genuine item on that note.\n\nTo help reinforce that idea, the company just announced it has completed product development and has begun distribution of its unique tetrahydrocannabivarin (THC-V) coffee and tea products to product beta testers. This comes on the heels of news that the company has been approved as an Amazon.com platform seller for its Hemp You Can Feel branded line of CBD products.\n\nAccording to the release, \u201cCannabis Global has integrated three internally developed technologies into the unique manufacturing process for the industry\u2019s first THC-V beverages. The first of these is the process developed by the Company to produce 70%+ loaded THC-V, controlled release, nanoparticles utilizing laboratory-based, pharmaceutical-grade production equipment. The Company is also utilizing both its internally developed powerization and one step dosing system, ensuring precise dosing and significantly faster production. The Company has filed provisional patents on all three technologies.\u201d\n\nAs noted, Cannabis Global (OTCMKTS:MCTC) has recently filed six patents on cannabinoid extraction technologies and delivery systems. Management is currently working with patent counsel to protect various other technologies it has developed or is currently developing, including its programs pertaining to cannabinoid glycosides, polymeric cannabinoid nanoparticles and nanofibers, and its hemp extract-based alcohol replacement technologies.\n\n\u201cOur unique infusion and production technologies provide Cannabis Global with a product purity advantage as well as a clear path to low cost leadership,\u201d commented CEO Arman Tabatabaei. \u201cThe THC-V cannabinoids are synthesized and entirely free of impurities. While there were some upfront technology development and intellectual property protection costs, we expect our ongoing variable production costs to be less than half of any potential competitor. Via our technologies, we turn one of the cannabis industry\u2019s most expensive items \u2013 pure THC-V cannabinoids \u2013 into a cost-effective solution that sets a new standard for product purity in the cannabinoid-based products marketplace.\u201d\n\nMCTC Holdings Inc (OTCMKTS:MCTC) had no reported sales in its last quarterly financial data. In addition, the company is battling some balance sheet hurdles, with cash levels struggling to keep up with current liabilities ($157K against $1.5M, respectively).\n\n**Curaleaf Holdings Inc (OTCMKTS:CURLF)** shares have been moving steadily higher as the company continues to expand and solidify itself as one of the primary leaders in the space, particularly in the US market.\n\nCURLF shares pushed above their key 200-day simple moving average line two weeks ago, and have held up above that key technical marker on a closing basis since, with two critical tests, both passed nicely thus far. At this point, all of the stock\u2019s major MA\u2019s are curving into a bullish posture on a long-term basis.\n\nCuraleaf Holdings Inc (OTCMKTS:CURLF) promulgates itself as a company that operates as an integrated medical and wellness cannabis operator in the United States. The Company is the parent of Curaleaf, Inc., a leading vertically integrated cannabis operator in the United States. Headquartered in Wakefield, Massachusetts, Curaleaf, Inc. has a presence in 12 states.\n\nCuraleaf, Inc. operates 30 dispensaries, 12 cultivation sites and 9 processing sites with a focus on highly populated, limited license states, including Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York. Curaleaf, Inc. leverages its extensive research and development capabilities to distribute cannabis products in multiple formats with the highest standard for safety, effectiveness, consistent quality and customer care. Curaleaf is committed to being the industry\u2019s leading resource in education and advancement through research and advocacy.\n\nCuraleaf Inc.\u2019s Florida operations were the first in the cannabis industry to receive the Safe Quality Food certification under the Global Food Safety Initiative, setting a new standard of excellence. It cultivates, processes, markets, and/or dispenses a range of cannabis products in various operating markets, including flower, pre-rolls and flower pods, dry-herb vaporizer cartridges, concentrates for vaporizing, concentrates for dabbing, tinctures, lozenges, capsules, and edibles.\n\nShares of the stock have powered higher over the past month, rallying roughly 26% in that time on strong overall action.\n\nCuraleaf Holdings Inc (OTCMKTS:CURLF) generated sales of $129.8M, according to information released in the company\u2019s most recent quarterly financial report. That adds up to a sequential quarter-over-quarter growth rate of 30.3% on the top line. In addition, the company has a strong balance sheet, with cash levels far exceeding current liabilities ($251M against $177.1M).",

        "selftext": "Every now and then, a pennystock comes around that makes you think: How the hell is this a pennystock? How is this valued so low?\n\nWell my coworkers and I have been trading for a long time, and this is very likely one of them. *(Computer geeks are going to love this especially).*\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n$OSS, One Stop Systems, since its IPO in 2018, has been silently building a tech empire behind our backs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(*You're gonna lose your literal mind when you read the next part:*)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**They are officially partnered with:** Apple, Nvidia, Intel, AMD, Boeing, IBM, Lenovo, HP, Lyft, Puma, Toshiba, Thunderbolt, Universal Audio, Focusrite, and Cisco etc... These are only 15 of their 50+ major international partnerships.\n\n*(yes, this is a pennystock.)*\n\n**U.S. Military:** On top of this, OSS also has multiple million-dollar contracts with the U.S. Navy and U.S. Military, as they provide the pre-constructed systems and power required for AI intelligence, DLSS, and large scale data transfer.\n\n*(This sub goes batshit crazy when a pennystock lands even ONE of the above partnerships. They have more than 50 already in motion.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What do they do? What makes them so special?**\n\nOSS in layman\u2019s terms is a company that takes top-end processors and GPUs, and uses their PCIe gen 4.0 expansion technology to merge them into a military-grade/data center supercomputer.\n\nBut aren\u2019t there many companies that can do this? No. They are the only company in the world with a PCIe 4.0 expansion system that can support NVIDIA\u2019s top end GPU\u2019s. (*Nvidia A-100*)\n\nThis means that they own nearly 100% of the market share in Nvidia's latest PCIe GPU technology.\n\n*(PCIe gen 3.0 is the only other option, but is 50% slower than PCIe 4.0.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What else makes them so special?** Their Financials.\n\nCompare their financials to the pennystocks we always talk about on this subreddit. It\u2019s absurd. They ACTUALLY MAKE MONEY.\n\nOSS's latest 10-K showed a record $ 60 MILLION in revenue, a 57% increase YoY.\n\nSome of the biggest companies in the world like Amazon, took over 10 years to make their first dollar. \n\nOSS is only on YEAR 2 and they are only $1 MILLION away from becoming a profitable operation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How is this possible?** Three reasons:\n\n1. They completely dominate the high-end PCIe sector of the tech industry. I challenge you to find a single other PCIe 4.0 expansion system on the market.\n2. Their CEO David Raun has led two companies to record revenues in the PCIe and NVMe industry, and one was bought out by Broadcom.\n3. They are at the forefront of far too many industries that require this level of technology.
