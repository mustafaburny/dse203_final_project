Biggest competitor of PTRA on the EV bus market is a chinese company. Thankfully, a NDAA that was passed in a bipartisan fashion a year ago provides a restriction on funding to be used from a federal transit agency to a Chinese owned or operated company.\n* What specific aspects of the infrastructure bill might advantage PTRA (according to John Allen in the 08-11-2021 press release) :\n   * $800 million a year for 5 years guaranteed\n   * $2.5 billion, up to $5 billion for electric school buses\n   * $2.25 billion to electrify the ports\n   * $7.5 billion for charging infrastructure\n\n**Good reasons to buy in general :**\n\n* Only american EV bus company that also sells charging infrastructure, batteries, and powertrain\n   * Partnership with Thomas (school buses), LG (battery components), Vanhool (coaches), Frieghtliner (delivery trucks), Optimal EV (airport and hospital transit), Komatsu (construction equipment), Lightning motors (sprinter vans)\n* 2 decades of experience in a very young market with plenty of space to grow\n   * Bus with the biggest battery capacity and milage (300-ish miles compared to european buses with 100-200 miles)\n* Politically indifferent\n   * Conservative = protectionism = good for American PTRA\n   * Liberals = weird taxes on carbon emitting businesses = good for PTRA\n\n**The play :**\n\n* Expect a bump in price and price targets when the infrastructure deal passes.\n* Hold that shit till 2035\n\n# Paya Holdings, Inc.\n\n**Fundamentals :**\n\n* NTM TEV / Revenues = 5.05\n* NTM TEV / EBITDA = 18.22\n* Liabilities as a percentage of TEV = 61.7%\n* Mean street target (tip ranks) = 14.50 (44.71% upside, backed by Morgan Stanley, Truist, BTIG)\n\n**Catalyst :**\n\n* Voting to cut warrant-sponsored dilution from 17.7 mil shares to 4.6 mil shares happening on september 10.\n\n**Good reasons to buy in general :**\n\n* Very good multiples for a double digit growth company compared to peers (Paypal, Square, etc.).\n* Profitable as fuck @ 25.7% EBITDA margins\n* Institutions buying up like crazy with zero institution holding a net short position.\n* IV low as hell.\n\n**The play :**\n\n* Expect a bump in price on September 10.\n* Hold or sell that shit after it pops to 15$.

        "selftext": "**Summary:**\n\n* Affirm is a major player in the booming \u201cpoint of sale financing\u201d or \u201cbuy now pay later\u201d niche.\n* Affirm lets online shoppers choose an installment plan at checkout.\n* The point of sale financing market exploded during the pandemic and is expected to keep growing fast.\n* Competitor Afterpay was recently acquired by Square, and there is speculation that Affirm may be an acquisition target.\n\n**What they do:**\n\nAffirm operates a point-of-sale payment solution for consumers. Its payment network allows consumers to pay for purchases with an installment plan.  \n \n\nAffirm pays the merchant the full amount upfront. They charge an APR of 10 to 30 percent, depending on the plan and on the buyer\u2019s credit. The Affirm app makes it easy for buyers to keep track of payments and sends reminders.  \n \n\nAffirm also receives a fee from merchants. Online sellers have found that point-of-sale financing increases sales volume and reduces cart abandonment, so they are willing to pay for the service.  \n \n\nThere were over 12,000 active merchants using the Affirm platform in March 2021, more than double the number in the same quarter of 2020. Active consumers grew 60% to 5.4 million in the same period. Gross merchandise volume grew 83% to $2.3 billion.  \n \n\nAffirm has an exclusive relationship with Shopify ($SHOP), and provides point-of-sale financing to Shopify merchants.  \n \n\nShopify is a leading competitor to Amazon. They are growing at a wild rate: gross merchandise volume was up 119% in the last reported quarter and the number of merchants with Shopify stores has been rising at 126% a year. Shopify now powers over 1.7 million businesses in more than 175 countries.  \n \n\nAffirm\u2019s relationship with Shopify allows them to offer their services to an enormous and rapidly growing customer base.\n\n**Why they\u2019re spiking in interest:**  \n \n\nReddit mentions of $AFRM in the last 8 days leaped 875% from the previous 8-day period.  \n \n\nThe surge was kicked off by the August 3 news that Affirm will work with Apple ($AAPL) to provide installment plans for Apple device purchasers in Canada.  \n \n\nThat announcement was followed on August 5 with news that Square ($SQ) is acquiring Australian buy-now-pay-later provider Afterpay for $29 billion. Affirm shares gained 18% on the combined news.  \n \n\nThe Square/Afterpay combination will provide competition for Affirm, but it also brought attention to the sector.  \n \n\nThere has been speculation that another major player seeking to move into the buy-now-pay-later space will acquire Affirm rather than develop their own system.  \n \n\nShopify (which already owns 7.6% of Affirm), PayPal, and even card giants like Visa and Mastercard have been suggested as potentially interested in acquiring Affirm.  \n \n\nNotable comments from Reddit:  \n \n\n\"I\u2019m long on $AFRM. The financial sector is dinosaurs through and through. If you\u2019ve ever applied for (and received) a mortgage, it\u2019s a nightmare. It requires little imagination on my part for Affirm or \u201cGreen Sky\u201d to open up to home and auto loans.\"\n\n\\- PinBot1138  \n \n\n\u201cPeople should probably get AFRM for when it gets acquired for a free 30%.\u201d  \n \\- Lukebreit  \n \n\nSignal: Over 77% of the $AFRM float is held by institutions. Scottish investment management firm Baillie Gifford is the largest institutional holder, with over $75 million worth of shares.\n\n \n\n**Why $AFRM could be valuable:**\n\nThe buy-now-pay-later has enormous upward momentum. Sales have increased dramatically and the increase is expected to continue. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMcKinsey &amp; Company\u2019s annual POS Financing Survey found that about 60% of consumers are likely to use point-of-sale financing over the next six to 12 months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAffirm founder and CEO Max Levchin has a record of developing successful and innovative payment systems: he\u2019s one of the founders of PayPal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAffirm does not charge late payment fees and has a fixed monthly payment system. This feature is attractive to users who are concerned with the complexities of credit card billing and payment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAffirm\u2019s Net Promoter Score - a measure of customer loyalty - places the company at 78, above Amazon and just below Apple. 64% of transactions are from repeat users, and repeat customers spend an average of $2,200 per year. Delinquency rates were just over 1% in 2020.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSix of 10 analysts covering the stock rate it \u201cBuy\u201d, with the other 4 placing it at \u201cHold\u201d. The consensus price target is $76.71, 14% above the current level.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRapid user growth, high customer retention, and a rapidly expanding market add up to very strong growth prospects for $AFRM.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe stock has dropped to under 50% of its post-IPO surge of $140 per share and has settled into a steady band in the $60-$70 range.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPost-IPO hype often drives new listings to unrealistic valuations. When they drop back to a more realistic level many retail investors become frustrated and drop out. That leaves a core of institutional holders and a strong base for appreciation of positive news.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What the risks are:**\n\nAffirm is not profitable and is not expected to achieve profitability soon. The Company also has a high debt/equity ratio of 87.95%. The Company has adequate working capital but the combination of debt and losses is still a concern.  \n \n\nAffirm operates in a highly competitive market. Right now that market is dominated by relatively new companies like Afterpay, and Klarna. The sector\u2019s rapid growth could attract competition from larger companies with greater financial capacity than Affirm.  \n \n\nAffirm faces credit risk. Default rates have been extremely low, but unexpected events could drive them high enough to affect the Company\u2019s results.  \n \n\nAffirm is exposed to a potential economic downturn. A recession could reduce the discretionary purchases that drive much of the Company\u2019s gross merchandise volume and increase default rates.  \n \n\nThe buy-now-pay-later sector could attract increased government regulation, which could affect the Company's results and stock price.  \n \n\n***Bottom line:***\u00a0*Affirm\u2019s lack of profitability makes it a speculative play. But its rapid revenue growth and established position in an exploding market make it an interesting speculative play. There is strong potential for acquisition and for medium to long-term growth. Watch for the release of Q4 and full FY 2021 results, scheduled for Sept. 9.*",

        "selftext": "Listen up you autistic retards this shit is serious. Coinbase has basically been hoeing hardcore since its direct listing in April. This bitch has been getting reamed for 4 months BUT \\*cue picture\\* let's take a look at the chart and see what's up\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[COIN Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/x6qvq5tiuvk71.png?width=2358&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3eec4721d35b1315ec0be5e51129e93926fc00f)\n\nNow i ain't no fucking artist and i may have a learning disability but I know a cup when i see one and if you look at this chart, even in ur peripheries you'll notice a small cup and handle that's formed in between the support lines, you'll also notice the middle support line recently did an r/S flip i.e. went from being a resistance line to support line.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow with the small cup in place it may be high time for Coinbase to continue this trend up and fill up the bigger cup by flying back to the 420-450 range. Also the velocity at which alt currencies move if there is a decent rally in the next few weeks, there's potential this sees an even bigger push to go back up where it came from. The MACD looks bullish with potentially indicating this reversal will become a rally. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n However, the fundamentals are also insanely undervalued right now. I'm talking this thing has a mufuckin current PE ratio of 28 only considering the first 2 quarters this year i.e. NOT COUNTING any estimates from q3 and q4 this year. I'm talking they made rev of about a billion dollars in FY2020 with about 350 mill in net income, Q1 2021 they made over 1.6 billion in revenue and more than doubled net income relative to the ENTIRE PREVIOUS YEAR.  Q2 2021 they made revenue of 2.23 billion netting 1.6 fucking billion in a damn quarter. They're literally reaching exponential growth as we speak and lets be honest the industry they're in is primed to grow substantially in the foreseeable future. Now if you look at their guidance for q3 and q4 they are not expecting to beat the net income of q2 but they also expect continued profitability and could potentially beat forecasts IF certain coins that are traded on their platform rally hard. For comparison, Square is trading at a FORWARD PE (2024) of 73, PayPal FORWARD PE 2024 of 32, I could go on and on. So really their current annual PE is considerably less than 28 once earnings come in for q3 and q4.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a cash cow of a company fundamentals and technicals seem to be aligning nicely. I think you can't go wrong with far out leaps however you must know that I am retarded and you would be an even bigger retard if you listened to me, jk you prolly can't even read so I'm not worried.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR COIN to the moon fam!!!\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not currently in a position but considering loading the $300 calls exp dec 21",

        "selftext": "Just wondering what people's thoughts are on Affirm earning's on Sep 9th? \n\nSome things I've been considering...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. There is a possibility that earnings could miss estimates... even though they estimated low, around 225 M for this quarter. This would be due to Peloton shitting the bed. Before the Amazon deal... Peloton was Affirm's largest customer. The Peloton collapse will affect Affirm.\n2. According to a Simply Wall Street article anything below $270 M will not be seen by the street as a surprise. So if Affirm beats... it has to be substantial.\n3. So much depends on the guidance they will offer and more info about the Amazon deal. I'd like to see what they predict. I believe the guidance regarding this will determine whether or not the SP rises or sinks. Amazon is a monster... and this deal was huge for Affirm.\n4. It will be really interesting to see Apple's performance in Canada with PayBright. A company that Affirm acquired. I called my local Apple store (in Canada) and spoke with sales supervisor. They told me approximately 2/10 purchases are funded via Paybright! Anecdotal yes... small sample size.. yes... but you can extrapolate this... something to think about.\n5. There is a lot of momentum in this space. We saw this with SQ's all stock offering worth 29 B for After pay.\n6. Affirm has been in business since 2012. Think about all that data and analysis they have collected on borrowers! That's a gold mine and in this day and age data analytics is everything. \n7. Which leads me to potential suitors for Affirm... Apple, Shopify, Amazon, WallMArt... hell I bet even JPM is interested. Considering traditional banking will be taken to the cleaners if they don't do anything... soon. My money is on Shop to take them out as they own 8% already.\n8. Max Levchin the CEO is switched on. He's been here before and can execute. Just look at PayPal.\n\nSo your turn... what do you think?\n\nFull disclosure... 23 calls. Nov $70's and Jan $85's.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, September 8, 2021**\n\n*Hey Psychos! So there was no recap yesterday, got mixed up and didn't have the time*\n\nStocks fell today, extending the previous day\u2019s decline in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) as market participants continue to digest the recent August Job Report and concerns surrounding rising coronavirus infections across the US. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) 0.33% down while the SPY and DIA fell 0.11% and 0.2% respectively. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 1.10%.\n\nYung-Yu Ma. Chief Investment Strategist at BMO Capital said, \u201cWe think the fundamental drivers of strong earnings, an accommodative Fed, and a still healthy appetite for risk taking are really what\u2019s going to support the market for the rest of the year.\u201d \n\nThe Labor Department released their monthly unemployment report, which showed hiring in August slow down dramatically as the US continues to battle massive spikes in coronavirus Delta cases in certain parts of the country, mainly the South/Southeast (according to the CDC, roughly \u2153 of all COVID-related hospitalizations are in Texas and Florida as both states deal with record coronavirus cases and low hospital capacity). Due to this surge and the reimposition of pandemic-era restrictions in areas with high transmission rates, employment numbers came in shockingly low compared to estimates and the previous month\u2019s numbers. Here are the numbers.\n\n* **Change in non-farm payrolls:** \\+235,000 vs. +733,000 expected and a revised +1.053 million in July\n* **Unemployment rate, August:** 5.2% vs. 5.2% expected and 5.4% in July\n* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.6% vs. 0.3% expected and 0.4% in July \n* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 4.3% vs. 3.9% expected and 4.0% in July\n\nPresident Biden said of the report, \u201cWhile I know some wanted to see a larger number today and so did I, what we\u2019ve seen this year is continued growth, month after month, in job creation. This is the kind of growth that makes our economy stronger.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Fed have consistently signaled they will be looking especially closely at labor market data to determine when to start tapering the pandemic-era quantitative easing program. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the August Jobs Report could be his signal to hit the \u201csubstantial further progress mark\u201d the Fed stipulated in December and begin tapering. He said, \u201cI think that one more good job report if it\u2019s in the 850,000 to 1 million range will be sufficient to claim substantial further progress in employment for tapering.\u201d August was not the report they were looking for. \n\nIn its latest Beige Book, which is basically a report by the Federal Reserve on current economic conditions, members said the economy downshifted slightly due to Delta variant concerns. The report stated, \u201cThe deceleration in economic activity was largely attributable to a pullback in dining out, travel, and tourism in most Districts, reflecting safety concerns due to the rise of the Delta variant, and, in many cases, international travel restrictions.\u201d \n\nIn the US, the surge in infections in certain parts of the nation continues unabated, with hospitalizations this weekend roughly 300% higher than Labor Day weekend in 2020, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The surge in patients comes as the highly contagious Delta variant continues to spread across the US, and coincided with a weekend that saw a spike in travel. According to the Transportation Security Administration, more than 3.5 million people travelled across the country on Friday and Saturday for the Labor Day holiday, despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s recommendation for unvaccinated people to refrain from traveling. \n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/07/us-covid-patients-hospitals-surge](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/07/us-covid-patients-hospitals-surge)\n\n[https://www.kq2.com/content/news/Health-officials-urge-caution-as-students-return-to-class-after-long-holiday-weekend--575252751.html](https://www.kq2.com/content/news/Health-officials-urge-caution-as-students-return-to-class-after-long-holiday-weekend--575252751.html)\n\nIn other news, the battle between Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos is heating up! Last week, SpaceX sent a filing to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) accusing Amazon of using regulatory and legal means to stifle and slowdown competition. SpaceX said, \u201cWhile SpaceX has proceeded to deploy more than 1,700 satellites, Amazon has yet to even attempt to address the radiofrequency interference and orbital debris issues that must be resolved before Amazon can deploy its constellation\u201d and suggested \u201cas it falls behind competitors \\[Amazon\\] is more than willing to use regulatory and legal processes to create obstacles designed to delay those competitors from leaving Amazon even further behind\u201d (ouch).\n\nIn response, Amazon said, Whether it is launching satellites with unlicensed antennas, launching rockets without approval, building an unapproved launch tower, or re-opening a factory in violation of a shelter-in-place order, the conduct of SpaceX and other Musk-led companies makes their view plain: rules are for other people, and those who insist upon or even simply request compliance are deserving of derision and ad hominem attacks. If the FCC regulated hypocrisy, SpaceX would keep the commission very busy.\u201d SpaceX won this one IMO, that was a nasty burn. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Job openings in July as measured by JOLTS soared by a staggering 749,000 \u2014 hitting yet another all-time high just shy of 11 million open jobs, enough to eliminate most of the current slack in the labor market.\n* El Salvador became the first country in the world to roll out a digital currency as a form of legal tender, allowing businesses and customers to transact using blockchain. There are some initial teething problems with the launch of the Chivo, the country\u2019s wallet app and locals being unfamiliar with the technology. Digital currencies also fell, though I don\u2019t know unknown if the drop is correlated to the launch in El Salvador\n* Damn, the buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) market is red-hot right now. Following Sqaure\u2019s (SQ) acquisition of Afterpay for $29 billion and Amazon (AMZN) partnering up with Affirm (AFRM) to offer BNPL on Amazon, PayPal (PYPL) is now stepping into the arena by acquiring Japanese BNPL firm Paidy for $2.7 billion\n* Twitter (TWTR) launched a global test of a tool it calls Communities, a feature similar to Facebook Groups that gives users a way to tweet to people with similar interests. This follows the recent launch of Super Follows, where content creators can charge their followers for their content. \n* Applied Materials (AMAT) announced it was releasing two new tools aimed at improving efficiency of making a new class of chips for electric vehicles. The machines announced on Wednesday are designed for chips made from a material called silicon carbide. Such chips are gaining traction in electric vehicles like those made by Tesla Inc because they are more efficient and lighter in weight than standard silicon chips for transmitting power from a car's battery to its motors, helping improve range. Silicon carbide chips are difficult to manufacture because the material is very hard\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* ASML target raised by Wells Fargo (WFC) from $800 to$975 at Overweight.

        "selftext": "Living in today\u2019s word is quite different than growing up in the 80s. For example you can find a job by picking up your phone and possibly be at work within the same day or even hours. If you want to know where a friend or loved one is you do not have to go looking for them or wait until you know they are going to be home you can simply look at their location, and if you need to talk to them you don\u2019t have to go through an operator you can simply just call or text them. Today the amount of work abundance and money making opportunities is honestly quite incredible. But what about money, there was no e-currency or tokens back then, heck the only thing there was were stocks, gold and money. As time went on we started seeing the internet come out and with that is when the e-currencies started being developed like PayPal and such. Now we are developing into a time where your cash is starting to become annoying and the governance of a currency is becoming more widespread known as fraud money. My point is that over a period of only 40 years or so, we have evolved passed using certain pieces of technologies and other every day items that at the time we thought we would never be able to live without, but as time went on these objects became obsolete and other newer, more efficient objects are now the new normal. I believe this is the way the new currency is moving into our world, just in an even expedited manner. Only time will tell though.",

It is now trading at year to date lows and offers significant value upside to patient investors. Following are the highlights from Opera\u2019s Q2 \u201921 results.\n\n* 87% QoQ Revenue Growth to $60.2M \u2014 A beat by $4.1M(7% beat to midpoint)\n* 17% sequential increase in revenue \u2014 Largest increase since going public\n* Breakeven adjusted EBITDA\n* 95% gross margin\n* 49% sequential increase in Opera News revenue\n* Increased FY \u201921 revenue guidance 2nd time this year to $242-247M ( 48% YoY growth at midpoint)\n* Adjusted EBITDA FY \u201921 guidance of $10-$20M\n* Cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities of \\~$200M\n* After Seeing good results, reiterated plans to continue investing AEBITDA growth into growth objectives of growing Opera News in Western markets, scaling Dify in additional geographies and new products, and investing in the Opera Gaming division.\n\n**Opera By the Numbers**\n\nI am using data from 2020 Annual filing(20-F) and the most recent monetization of Opera's 29% preferred shares to make the case on how undervalued Opera is and how market is not giving any valuation to Opera's core business which is generating $245M of annual revenue(FY' 21 estimated) and aggressively investing for future growth by plowing all adjusted EBITDA growth from FY' 20 to expand into new verticals and geographies.\n\n* Market Cap: \\~$1B\n   * Cash, cash equivalent &amp; marketable securities : \\~$200M\n   * Book value of starmaker(35% discount/DLOM) : $55M\n   * Book value of Nanobank : $266M\n   * Book value of Opay(15% discount/DLOM) : $49M\n* Opera Core= 1$B - $200M - $370M = $430M\n   * Opera GM = 95%\n   * Opera's AEBITDA Goal = 25%-30% of revenue\n      * Proved from Q4'20 results that they can operate at 28% AEBITDA margin\n      * Opera's FY'21 Investments - All adjusted EBITDA growth in FY '21 is invested back in business to expand in Europe and N. America\n* Opera FY' 21 Forecast(high end) - $247M revenue, $20M AEBITDA\n   * **Trading at \\~1.7 x FY'21 Est. Revenue**\n\n**The recent $400M Opay funding round from Softbank at $2B valuation and subsequent monetization of 29% of Opera's preferred share in OPay at $50M shows how undervalued Opera minority investments are on the books**.\n\n* Opay is valued at \\~$2B post money, and although Opera has not officially disclosed its latest stake, as per my calculations, Opera\u2019 stake of 13.1%(10.24% Preferred shares + 2.86% Ordinary shares) got diluted to \\~10.5% after the latest $400M funding round from Softbank. Since then, Opera sold 29% of its preferred shares, its latest stake dropped to \\~8% which is now worth \\~$160M compared to $49M which they have on the books.\n* Starmaker\u2019s 19.6% stake is valued on the books at $55M valuing starmaker at \\~$280M. Similar to Opay, Starmaker,  which is profitable and has Q1 FY '21 revenue run rate of \\~$180M -- 41% sequential increase from $127M run rate at end of 2020 -- , is valued on Opera\u2019s book at massive discount.\n* Nanobank, where Opera has 42% stake and valued on books at $266M,  has been sequentially growing at 10-15% since its covid bottom and should reach pre-covid run rate of $120M during Q1 2022.\n\nWhichever multiple one is comfortable with for Opera Core business, which has gross margins of 95% with 25-30% AEBITDA margin profile, growing at 48% YoY in FY'21 and should continue to grow between 20-25% for next several years due to investments into growing new legs in fintech/cashback and gaming and also expanding in Europe and America where advertising impression are 10x better monetized compared to Africa and Asia, where majority of its 400M users are currently located, it is hard not to see how undervalued Opera is.\n\n* If you use 4x revenue multiple with the book valuation on minority stakes, Opera should be valued at \\~1.6B ( \\~$15 per ADS) -- 66% appreciation potential based on $9 SP.\n* If you use 6x multiple with book valuation on minority stakes, Opera should be valued at \\~2.1B ( \\~20 per ADS) --122% Appreciation potential\n* If you use 8x multiple with book valuation on minority stakes, Opera should be valued at \\~2.6B ( \\~25 per ADS) -- 177% Appreciation potential\n* If you start applying growth multiples to Opera with the assumption that Opera can grow faster than 20-25% with modest success in Gaming and Fintech initiatives and get to 20-30% AEBITDA margin profile by FY\u201923, you can assign a 10x-12x revenue multiple to Opera and valuation would be much higher.\n\n**Opera History**\n\nOpera Ltd, the Opera browser company, was established in Norway in 1996  and is one of the few survivors from the Internet Explorer era of early 2000 . It was bought by a consortium led by Yahui Zhou in 2016 for $600M. In 2018, It was listed on Nasdaq as OPRA.\n\nNow, Opera is no longer just a browser company. In fact, its core browser business only contributes about half of its revenue through search and ad monetization. The other half of revenue is contributed by advertising, mostly via its Opera news app which is now a top 10 news app on both android and iOS in all of Africa, Germany, France, UK and now in the US. What Opera has done successfully is to take its browser user base of 300 million MAUs and then get them to other services like News, Fintech and Gaming. Opera calls it Browser+ strategy.\n\nIt also used its browser user base to spin off 2 very successful businesses:\n\n* OPay, a leading mobile wallet and mobile money operator in Nigeria where it had 13.1% stake(as of FY\u2019 20) which most recently raised $400M at $2B valuation.\n* Nanobank, a micro credit provider in emerging markets of Africa, Asia and Latin America where it has 42% stake. Nanobank was doing $117M quarterly revenue at 30% AEBITDA margin pre-covid, but it is still recovering from covid impact in its biggest market - India and had Q2' 21 revenue of $57M at \\~3% AEBITDA margin. Opera merged its fintech business in India and Kenya with Mobi Magic to form Nanobank with 42% stake in August 2020.\n\nIt also opportunistically invested $30M for 19.35% stake in starmaker -- a social network for music lovers and Karaoke artists -- and is growing like a wildfire, 250% YoY growth to $180M run rate in Q1' 21 with sequential acceleration of 41% from $127M revenue run rate in Q4'20.\n\n**Opera Products**\n\n**Opera browser :** Amongst the giants, Apple Safari and Google Chrome, Opera has built a niche and cult following of users who like Opera browser for many of its differentiated features - Integrated Messaging apps, Integrated music players, built in VPN, ad blocker and many more. Opera browser for desktop is available on  MacOS, Windows and Linux and has seen install base growing from 42 million MAUs in 2016 to 80 million MAUs in 2020, a CAGR of 17%. Opera Mobile browser and its data saving browser Opera Mini, have grown from 164 million to 190 million MAUs, a CAGR of 4%.\n\n**Opera GX :** Opera GX, the gaming browser which Opera launched for Gamers with differentiated features like CPU and RAM limiter, Gaming aesthetics, discord integration and Gaming corner which surfaces deals and news related to Games. Since its launch in June 2019, It has grown to over 10 million MAUs in just over 2 years.\n\n**Opera News App :** Opera News is AI based News aggregator which personalizes the news based on their browsing history. It is #1 news app in all of the major African economies  - Nigeria, South Africa, Egypt, Kenya and Ghana. Since its launch in Germany, France, UK and US in Q4'20, It has become #1 or #2 news apps in Germany, France and the UK and in the top 10 in the US. It has grown at 42% CAGR -- from 72 million MAUs in Q4'17 to 211 million MAU in Q4'20 and is growing revenue at 160% YoY as of Q4'20.\n\n**Opera Ad Network :** Opera is one of the top 10 publishers of media impression given its scale in browser and its news app. Instead of relying on 3rd party ad networks, Opera has launched its own ad network, primarily to serve its own ad inventory and since its launch 2 years ago, it has grown at 130% YoY. It is tracking to $80 million in FY'21 revenue, 50% growth in daily revenue run rate year to date.\n\n**Dify :** Opera acquired 2 small companies in 2020 - Pocosys and Fjord bank and used Pocosys to build a new fintech product called Dify which was launched in Spain in Feb '21. Initially Dify will provide an integrated mobile wallet, Debit Card and Cashback for its users with plans to launch additional services like BNPL/Credit and fractionalized share investing to its 50M active users in Europe.\n\n**Opera Gaming :** Early 2021, Opera acquired leading 2D gaming engine company, YoYo Games and launched a Gaming division combining it with its gaming focused browser Opera GX, which has grown quite rapidly to 10M active users since its launch in June 2019. Opera plans to build a gaming community around these 10M+ users and its thousands of GameMaker developers and has plans to launch a steam like service --Gamebox-- to offer gaming publishers a platform to monetize their games.\n\n**Business Model**\n\n* **Search revenue :** Opera primarily makes money from its 80 million desktop MAUs when they conduct searches from its search bar.  Opera has revenue sharing contracts with Google and Yandex.\n* **Advertising revenue :**  Opera makes advertising revenue 2 ways:\n   * Revenue shares from book marked link, speed dials and other forms of affiliate advertising on its browser. Each million Opera GX users bring $2.8M in yearly revenue and Opera is in early innings of monetizing this gaming user base.\n   * Native advertising in its Opera News App, growing at 160% YoY.\n* **Other revenue :** This low margin revenue comes from providing professional services to Opay. This is being phased out completely by FY'21 as Opay has scaled its operation with its own staff.\n\n**Financials**\n\nOpera Search and Advertising revenue have grown at \\~22% CAGR, from $33.5M in Q2' 18 to $60.2M in Q2' 21. This revenue comes at \\~95% gross margin and has AEBITDA margin profile of 20-30%. Opera has been investing for growth so it's AEBITDA margin have fluctuated from 0% to 41% since its IPO.\n\nOpera has forecasted FY' 21 revenue of $242-247M , 48% growth over FY \u201820. It has forecasted FY \u201821 AEBITDA of $10-20M, despite its stated objective of investing up to $100M into scaling its fintech initiative, Dify in FY' 21 and investing for growth in Opera News, Dify and Opera Gaming.\n\nWith covid recovery, momentum in its advertising business, over 10% browser growth in EU, and ramp up of Opera News App in US and Europe, Opera has projected to grow its search and advertising revenue at 25% YoY for next several years.\n\nOpera has always taken a very conservative approach with its forecast and has not assumed any significant contributions from its Fintech(Dify) and Gaming(YoYo Games) initiatives in its FY '21 guidance. Assuming moderate success from these initiatives where Opera is investing over $100M, Opera should easily grow at upwards of 30% YoY for the next several years and reach around $500M revenue in FY \u201823 at 25%+ AEBITDA margins.\n\n**Opera's Minority Stake**\n\n* **Opay -** Opay is leading mobile money wallet in Nigeria and has expanded to Egypt in early '21. In 2019, Opay raised $170M at a valuation of $500M in external funding from Softbank, Meituan and was doing $300M in transaction processing volume(TPV) per month. Since then it has grown to over 10 million MAUs. In 2020, Opay TPV/month grew 4.5 times -- from $450M in Jan to $2B in December. Most recently in June'21, Opay raised $400M at a $2B valuation. Opera also monetized 29% of its preferred share stake for $50M and has left around 8% of stake to participate in future growth of Opay.\n* **Starmaker -** Starmaker app, which has an installed base of over 100 million users,  is a social network for music lovers and Karaoke artists and is top 5 grossing music app in google play store in South East Asia, Middle East, South Asia and Europe.  When Opera invested $30M for a19.35% stake in Nov'18, it had a $17M run rate.  Since then it has been growing like a wildfire -- a CAGR of 157% in 2.5 years --  with YoY growth accelerating recently to 250% to  $180M Q1 '21 run rate and with sequential acceleration of 41% from $127M Q4'20 run rate.\n* **Nanobank -** Nanobank offers Micro lending and other financial services to the underbanked and underserved population in India, Indonesia, Kenya and Mexico via its mobile apps. Last year, Opera merged its micro lending operations in India and Kenya with Mobi Magic to form Nanobank for a 42% stake. Nanobank collectively has over 50 million users of its mobile app and has recently expanded into Mexico with credit card features for its underbanked population. Nanobank was growing revenue at a CAGR of 295% pre covid - scaling from $22M Q1 '19 revenue at 24% AEBITDA margin to $92M  Q4 '19 revenue at 41% AEBITDA margin. It has not yet completely recovered from covid in its largest market India and had $57M Q1 \u201821 revenue at 3% AEBITDA margin. Opera has stated that, with the expansion of Nanobank in Mexico and other Latin American countries, they expect Nanobank to come to pre covid quarterly revenue run rate of $120M at 30%+ AEBITDA margin next year.\n\n**Opera SUM-OF-PART valuation**\n\n1. **Conservative/Bear Case**\n\nStarmaker announced 3x growth in 2020 and $127m run rate at the end of Q4 \u201820. In Q1 \u201821, it has revenue run rate of $180M. I am using $45M as Q1 revenue and applying sequential growth of 25%, 15% and 5% to get to Q4 revenue of $68M.  Using arithmetic series sum over $45M Q1 \u201821 revenue and $68M Q4 \u201821 revenue gives 2021 revenue of $226m \\[ 4\\*(45+68)/2 \\]\n\nOpay does not report revenue run rate but TPV. Since Opay reported 4.5x TPV growth in 2020, TPV grew from $445M in January 2020 to $2B in December 2020. I am taking arithmetic series sum to get the total TPV of $14.7B for 2020 \\[12 \\* (445 + 2000)/2 \\] . Although Opera did not reveal the TPV for March 2021, they stated that the TPV is growing nicely. Along with additional product launches in additional countries, I am projecting 2x growth in TPV in 2021(a deceleration from 4.5x growth in 2020), with a TPV of $2B for Jan 2021 and $4B for Dec 2021. Taking the arithmetic series sum gives an expected 2021 TPV of $36B. I have looked at airtel Mobile Money and M-pesa revenue to TPV ratio ( 0.008 for airtel and 0.006 for M-pesa). Applying the average of 0.007 revenue to TPV ratio, gives Opay 2020 revenue of $103M and 2021 revenue of $252M. Currently Opay services are heavily discounted so their take rate is much lower than more established players like airtel and M-Pesa. Opay reported 2020 revenue of $69M and I am forecasting $21M as Q1 \u201821 revenue and applying 20% sequential growth rate through FY \u201821 gives Q4 \u201821 revenue of $37M. Using Arithmetic series sum, gives forecasted FY \u201821 revenue of $116M.\n\nBefore we do the sum of the part valuation of Opera, let's look at comparable companies :\n\n* Upstart holding(UPST), which is growing 200% YoY in FY \u201821,  is trading at 20x revenue multiple. It has a lower margin profile than Nanobank though . However, I am using only 6x multiple for Nanobank since it is projected to grow revenue at 29% compared to 100% for UPST. Nanobank is expected to achieve pre covid revenue run rate of $120M in Q1 \u201822 and as per my estimate, it should grow more than 100% YoY in FY\u201922.\n* Pinterest and Snap commanded a 50-70x revenue multiple during their 150% growth phase. I am using 8x multiple for starmaker.\n* Klarna, AfterPay, Square commanded 30-40x revenue multiple during 200+% revenue growth, I am using 8x revenue multiple for Opay\n\n**\ud83d\udcf7**\n\nThe above sum of part analysis is done using a super conservative valuation just to highlight the massive disconnect in market valuation of Opera\u2019s stock price. Opera and all its minority stakes are in hyper growth mode, and if one were to apply growth multiples, it can easily more than double this conservative sum-of-part valuation.\n\n1. **Base Case**\n\nThe base case assumes the market will give Opera\u2019s high gross margin(\\~95%) and 25-30% AEBITDA business, a higher multiple with a revenue forecasted to grow at 25% for next several years and valuing Opay and Starmaker which are growing upwards of 150% YoY a 30 to 40 multiple which similar companies have commanded during their hyper growth phase.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n1. **Bull Case**\n\nAs if Opera is not undervalued enough, Opera also has 2 new growth initiatives which could offer \\*significant\\* additional upside to base case.\n\n* Opera has ambitious growth plans with a new fintech initiative, called Dify, in Europe. What I like is the tight coupling of Cashback/Coupons/Payment/CryptoWallet in the browser. Imagine 10% of 50M users of opera browser in Europe use dify, and spend an average of $500/year, Opera could get $2.5B/year of transactions/payment through them. If average cashback is 5% of transaction amount and Opera\u2019s take rate is 30%, dify\u2019s revenue will be $38M/year. Although too soon, if Opera\u2019s is successful in getting 10% of its browser users in Europe to use Dify or gain additional browser users due to popularity of Dify and launch additional product like BNPL, one could argue that Dify, in itself, can grow into $1-2B business in next couple of years. You can see how Klarna, Afterpay are valued in private/public valuations today. For comparison, think Honey, which Paypal bought in 2018 for $4B dollars, for 14 million users generating $100M of revenue and the Cashback aspect of Dify is just one part of the overall Dify value proposition.\n* Opera also recently bought YoYo Games, makers of the popular indie 2D game engine, game maker. Time will tell if they can compete against powerhouses like Unity or Roblox, but you have to give the benefit of doubt to Yahui Zhou, the 60% owner of Opera. He has a knack for identifying boring assets and turning them into growth engines. Who would have thought that the Opera Browser business, which he bought for $600M, can launch many new and exciting businesses and also grow its core with differentiated offerings. We just need to wait and see what the future brings for this.\n* Opera also bought a bank in Europe, Fjord Bank. They have not shared their plans on what they are going to do here, but if they have ambition to be neobank like N26 or revolut, Opera can quickly scale this neobank given its large user base. They can offer investment services once they reach critical mass as part of this fintech offering.\n\nAssuming Dify and Gaming takes off, I do expect significant revenue expansion of Opera Core from $250M-260M in FY \u201821(55% YoY growth), to $360-380M in FY \u201822( 45% YoY growth), and to $480-520M in 2023(26% YoY). This growth would be at 20-30% AEBITDA margin. This type of growth commands a revenue multiple of 20+.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n**Catalyst**\n\n* Continued momentum in Opera Ads, improved monetization of Opera News in US and Europe can provide upside to conservative FY '21 guidance of $245M by $10-$15M\n* Scale out of its fintech initiative Dify to Germany and France to its 50 million MAUs in Europe at low CAC will yield additional revenue upside. Paypal bought Honey for $4B for its 14 million users generating $100M in annual revenue in 2018. If Opera can convert 10-15% of its 50 million users to its Dify/Cashback product, It can contribute $50M+ of incremental revenue in FY '22.\n* Continued growth in its minority stakes - Nanobank, Starmaker and OPay will provide additional upside to already low valuation.\n* A funding event/IPO of Nanobank and Starmaker can further unlock value of its minority stakes.\n* Continued momentum in Opera GX along with launch of Gamebox service will bring a viral effect and can help Opera double its Opera GX MAUs from 10 million to 20 million by early next year, bringing in additional $30M of FY'22 revenue.\n* A potential partnership with Oprah, and marketing Opera as Oprah's browser could bring in visibility and brand awareness in the US and can help Opera gain additional 10+ million users of its product in the US)\n* Continued scrutiny and regulation of big tech in the US and Europe is positive for smaller players like Opera.\n* Once Opera gets institution visibility, I think it can easily trade into $50+ after getting growth multiple.\n\n**Short Report**\n\nOpera was the target of [Hindenburg short report](https://hindenburgresearch.com/opera-phantom-of-the-turnaround/) back in Jan 2020. more than 18 months have passed since then time has proven that short thesis wrong. With the benefit of time on my side, following is the rebuttal to that short report.\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F\\_3HbFJ2\\_vQeKWl\\_JEzgbH7fJXZzniAtMSm80pqBows/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F_3HbFJ2_vQeKWl_JEzgbH7fJXZzniAtMSm80pqBows/edit)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOverall, I think risk-reward weigh heavily on Opera long side and offer significant upside opportunity to patient investors.\n\n*Disclosure/Disclaimer : \\*\\*\\*This is not investment advice or recommendation.

They are chinese so hard to trust. Company could be taken private and nobody knows if they will be relisted. So its a very high risk position. \n\nPAYO is a payment system provider like stripe, paypal and many. I think is overlooked as it only ipoed few months ago.

        "selftext": "Good morning degenerates, autists, and intellectually deficients.\n\nI have been lurking on this sub for the longest time, occasionally making some money on the juicy DDs posted here. Today, I felt like giving back by shining some light on 2 companies that have seemingly been forgotten by our community (retards typically have poor working memory, so you are forgiven). I can't write for shit, so here are some facts in bullet points detailing each play (fundamentals and catalysts/reason to bag hold).\n\n# Proterra\n\n**Fundamentals :**\n\n* NTM TEV / Revenues = 4.88\n* NTM TEV / EBITDA = 23.10\n* Liabilities as a percentage of TEV = 34.1%\n* Mean street target (tip ranks) = 15.50 (46,78% upside, backed by BofA and Citigroup)\n\n**Catalyst :**\n\n* Infrastructure bill baby. $39 billion USD for public transit, with around $7.5 going directly towards replacing buses. Biggest competitor of PTRA on the EV bus market is a chinese company. Thankfully, a NDAA that was passed in a bipartisan fashion a year ago provides a restriction on funding to be used from a federal transit agency to a Chinese owned or operated company.\n* What specific aspects of the infrastructure bill might advantage PTRA (according to John Allen in the 08-11-2021 press release) :\n   * $800 million a year for 5 years guaranteed\n   * $2.5 billion, up to $5 billion for electric school buses\n   * $2.25 billion to electrify the ports\n   * $7.5 billion for charging infrastructure\n\n**Good reasons to buy in general :**\n\n* Only american EV bus company that also sells charging infrastructure, batteries, and powertrain\n   * Partnership with Thomas (school buses), LG (battery components), Vanhool (coaches), Frieghtliner (delivery trucks), Optimal EV (airport and hospital transit), Komatsu (construction equipment), Lightning motors (sprinter vans)\n* 2 decades of experience in a very young market with plenty of space to grow\n   * Bus with the biggest battery capacity and milage (300-ish miles compared to european buses with 100-200 miles)\n* Politically indifferent\n   * Conservative = protectionism = good for American PTRA\n   * Liberals = weird taxes on carbon emitting businesses = good for PTRA\n\n**The play :**\n\n* Expect a bump in price and price targets when the infrastructure deal passes.\n* Hold that shit till 2035\n\n# Paya Holdings, Inc.\n\n**Fundamentals :**\n\n* NTM TEV / Revenues = 5.05\n* NTM TEV / EBITDA = 18.22\n* Liabilities as a percentage of TEV = 61.7%\n* Mean street target (tip ranks) = 14.50 (44.71% upside, backed by Morgan Stanley, Truist, BTIG)\n\n**Catalyst :**\n\n* Voting to cut warrant-sponsored dilution from 17.7 mil shares to 4.6 mil shares happening on september 10.\n\n**Good reasons to buy in general :**\n\n* Very good multiples for a double digit growth company compared to peers (Paypal, Square, etc.).\n* Profitable as fuck @ 25.7% EBITDA margins\n* Institutions buying up like crazy with zero institution holding a net short position.\n* IV low as hell.\n\n**The play :**\n\n* Expect a bump in price on September 10.\n* Hold or sell that shit after it pops to 15$. You do you.\n\nProof of positions : [https://imgur.com/gallery/Ch54jd6](https://imgur.com/gallery/Ch54jd6)\n\n**8000 shares of PAYA @ 10.42 + 100 Sep17'21 10C @ 1.05**\n\n**6000 shares of PTRA @ 11.08**",

        "selftext": "Listen up you autistic retards this shit is serious. Coinbase has basically been hoeing hardcore since its direct listing in April. This bitch has been getting reamed 4 and a half months and counting but \\*cue picture\\* let's take a look at the chart and see what's up\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[CB Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/aqjaxo37nvk71.png?width=2358&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=478a56b2d64a8f5278121224d85d13646b93ade2)\n\nNow i ain't no fucking artist and i may have a learning disability but I know a cup when i see one and if you look at this chart, even in ur peripheries you'll notice a small cup and handle that's formed in between the support lines, you'll also notice the middle support line recently did an r/S flip i.e. went from being a resistance line to support line.\n\nNow with the small cup in place it may be high time for Coinbase to continue this trend up and fill up the bigger cup by flying back to the 420-450 range. Also the velocity at which alt currencies move if there is a decent rally in the next few weeks, there's potential this sees an even bigger push to go back up where it came from. The MACD looks bullish with potentially indicating this reversal will become a rally. \n\n However, the fundamentals are also insanely undervalued right now. I'm talking this thing has a mufuckin current PE ratio of 28 only considering the first 2 quarters this year i.e. NOT COUNTING any estimates from q3 and q4 this year. I'm talking they made rev of about a billion dollars in FY2020 with about 350 mill in net income, Q1 2021 they made over 1.6 billion in revenue and more than doubled net income relative to the ENTIRE PREVIOUS YEAR.  Q2 2021 they made revenue of 2.23 billion netting 1.6 fucking billion in a damn quarter. They're literally reaching exponential growth as we speak and lets be honest the industry they're in is primed to grow substantially in the foreseeable future. Now if you look at their guidance for q3 and q4 they are not expecting to beat the net income of q2 but they also expect continued profitability and could potentially beat forecasts IF certain coins that are traded on their platform rally hard. For comparison, Square is trading at a FORWARD PE (2024) of 73, PayPal FORWARD PE 2024 of 32, I could go on and on. So really their current annual PE is considerably less than 28 once earnings come in for q3 and q4.\n\nThis is a cash cow of a company fundamentals and technicals seem to be aligning nicely. I think you can't go wrong with far out leaps however you must know that I am retarded and you would be an even bigger retard if you listened to me, jk you prolly can't even read so I'm not worried.\n\nTL:DR COIN to the moon fam!!!",

In March, the company started a fund focused on space-related investments, which has risen about 4% since its debut and now has more than $600 million in assets. Meanwhile, the firm\u2019s flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) is up to $22.5 billion, although it\u2019s down 2% year-to-date -- compared with a gain of more than 20% for the S&amp;P 500.",

        "selftext": "So, Alibaba is of course the most discussed stock in the last month on this sub, I think. So I decided to discuss Tencent, instead.\n\nI think Tencent is simply incredible. Let's see why:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **WeChat** \n\nThey own WeChat/Weixin (Weixin is for mainland China, WeChat for everywhere else. I will call it WeChat). WeChat is.. WeChat. Mohnish pabrai calls it \"a bazooka Tencent can fire at will\". It has 1.25 billion users. What can you do on WeChat? Everything. Text, pay for stuff, play games, shop online, anything. Imagine if the following app existed:\n\n* Need something on Amazon? No problem, you can do it directly from WeChat through its mini-app.\n* Need to pay something in a shop? Use TenPay.\n* Need a ride on Uber? Use WeChat mini-app.\n* Need to order food on DoorDash? WeChat.\n\nReplace Amazon with JD, Uber with Didi, DoorDash with Meituan, and you have WeChat. \n\nWeChat is a bazooka beause, if Tencent decides to partner with someone and allows them to integrate in their ecosystem, that business will explode. It happened with Pinduoduo, which mainly works on WeChat: it grew 100% last year.\n\nSince it runs the platform, Tencent gets a commission. Also, it stores all the data that goes through these apps. In 2020, revenue from WeChat was 16.7 billion dollars, out of 74.6 billion in total. WeChat has 3.2 million mini programs on its platform, which transacted 1.6 trillion RMB (247 billion $) in 2020. To get how much this thing is growing, in 2017 it was 210 billion RMB (32b).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Tencent's empire**\n\nTencent has an impressive number of businesses: they have a subscription revenue which is 62% that of Netflix; a media ads business (bigger than the Nyt), games, cloud, mobile payment services. Their business is so wide it is hard to navigate. Some examples:\n\n1. **Gaming**: Tencent has around 50% of market share in China in the mobile gaming industry. In 2020 they made 29.3 billions from games. In 2021 it is probably going to be lower. Online gaming industry in 2020 was 58b, it is expected to grow to 86b in 2027. Mobile gaming is projected to be 70% of the online gaming market in China by then.\n2. **TenPay**: There are two ways to pay for stuff in China: TenPay and AliPay. While in the West switched from cash to cards, and are still in transition, China has skipped a step and went directly to mobile payments. In 2018 already, a walloping 83% of all payments in China were made through mobile. Now it is around 90%. Cards are useless, in China: they account for less than 5% of payments. In the Western world, Google pay and Apple Pay are only now eroding the empire of Visa, Mastercard, American Express etc. China, on the other hand, was to Tencent and Alibaba like a smooth field: they just took over. Apple pay now has around 500 million users world-wide. Tencent has 900 millions. From the last financial report, Tencent shows that revenue of the financial technology and corporate services business increased by 40% year-on-year to RMB 41.9 billion (6. billions). China's mobile payment market is projected to reach 88.4 Billion usd by the year 2027, trailing a CAGR of 47.3%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Tencent's fantastic portfolio**:\n\nBefore you do a cf analysis of Tencent, you need to know that Tencent has a portfolio that is currently valued around 250 billions usd at present. It is like a financial version of Cthulhu, with tentacles everywhere. It is quite hard to navigate/find information about it. They say they are currently invested in over 700 companies, of which only 103 are publicly traded. This guy has put up a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1owpL6WmMK30X19Kw3BziAw39rGJbsfIMOOexdtvAkxU/edit) for you that tracks the most notable public ones.\n\nSome notable busineness Tencent owns (percentages might not be accurate):\n\na) Gaming:\n\n* 100% Riot Games (League of Legends)\n* 40% Epic Games (Fortnite)\n* 81.4% Supercell (Clash of Clans)\n* 10% BlueHole (PUBG)\n* 80% Grinding Gear Games (Path of Exile)\n* 5% Activision Blizzard.\n* 20% Kingsoft (gaming competitor in China &amp; cloud business)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nb) Finance:\n\n* 30% Webank (biggest online bank in China)\n* 2%? Khatabook (digital payments in India)\n* 25% Gojek (same in Indonesia)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nc) Social:\n\n* 50.1% Huya (twitch-like)\n* 38% Douyu (twitch-like)\n* 12% Snapchat\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nd) Music:\n\n* 58% Tencent music\n* 6.8% Spotify\n* 10% Universal music group\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ne) E-commerce:\n\n* 25% Sea ltd (which also makes games, does mobile payments etc)\n* 18% JD\n* 17% Pinduodo\n* 7% Vipshop\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nf) Other\n\n* 20% Meituan (Doordash of China)\n* 15% Nio (ev)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Valuation**\n\nHow do you value Tencent? Currently, Tencent has a market cap of 619.72b, with a P/E of 24 and P/fcf (trailing 12 months) of 22 (Do not forget the investment portfolio, as well). fcf grew 29.4% a year in the last 10 years. Tencent has Microsoft-style profit margins of 35%. Revenue is growing at more than 30% a year, which is insane for a company this size. With its impressive portfolio, Tencent is poised to have a leading role in a country that is growing it GDP at 7%, that soon will catch up with the US, and where around 500 million people are projected to reach middle class in the next 10 years, something which will benefit tech companies the most. Of course, the risks are China regulations, in particular its anti-monopoly campaign; China in general: VIE structure, accounting standards etc. Here is an earnings based model, but take it with a grain of salt. \n\nDiscount rate: 14%. Based on eps without nri. 20 years.\n\n* Best scenario (20%): year 1-10: 25% growth, y 10-20: 10%. Value: 112.13\n* Normal scenario (60%): y1-10: 18%; y10-20: 10%. Value: 70.38\n* Worst scenario (20%): y1-10: 15%. y10-20: 8%. Value: 55.27\n* Fair value: 75.7\n* current price: 64.56. Undervalued by 17.25 % for a 14% return.  \n\n\nOf course it's all about assumptions. If you raise margin of safety, cut down growth estimates etc, you will get a very different number. I think I used a fairly conservative growth estimate, though. I personally think the upside for Tencent is insane., even though it is a behemoth already. It is one of my strongest buys.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI might consider doing a separate post about the risks of investing in Tencent: China regulations etc. For now.. thanks for reading!\n\nSources:\n\n[https://www.businessofapps.com/data/wechat-statistics/](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/wechat-statistics/)\n\n[https://www.notboring.co/p/tencent-the-ultimate-outsider](https://www.notboring.co/p/tencent-the-ultimate-outsider)\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com) &amp; [gurufocus.com/](https://gurufocus.com/)\n\n[https://www.statista.com/topics/4322/apple-pay/](https://www.statista.com/topics/4322/apple-pay/)\n\n[https://daxueconsulting.com/payment-methods-in-china/](https://daxueconsulting.com/payment-methods-in-china/)\n\n[https://static.www.tencent.com/uploads/2021/04/08/960eae1f18dd716fd3a7d704e123d7a5.pdf](https://static.www.tencent.com/uploads/2021/04/08/960eae1f18dd716fd3a7d704e123d7a5.pdf)\n\n[https://min.news/en/economy/aa274e1f9ba05e4b8a246a71d9035681.html](https://min.news/en/economy/aa274e1f9ba05e4b8a246a71d9035681.html)\n\n[https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2020/10/08/2105516/28124/en/Global-Contactless-Payment-Transaction-Market-Report-2020-2027-Market-Expected-to-Grow-at-a-CAGR-of-49-7-U-S-Market-is-Estimated-at-10-Billion-While-China-is-Forecast-to-Grow-at-47.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2020/10/08/2105516/28124/en/Global-Contactless-Payment-Transaction-Market-Report-2020-2027-Market-Expected-to-Grow-at-a-CAGR-of-49-7-U-S-Market-is-Estimated-at-10-Billion-While-China-is-Forecast-to-Grow-at-47.html)\n\n[https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/05/04/2222088/28124/en/China-Online-Gaming-Market-Report-2021-Market-was-Valued-58-Billion-in-2020-and-is-Expected-to-Reach-to-86-Billion-by-2027-Top-Players-are-Tencent-NetEase-Kingsoft-Changyou-Shanda-.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/05/04/2222088/28124/en/China-Online-Gaming-Market-Report-2021-Market-was-Valued-58-Billion-in-2020-and-is-Expected-to-Reach-to-86-Billion-by-2027-Top-Players-are-Tencent-NetEase-Kingsoft-Changyou-Shanda-.html)\n\n[https://kr-asia.com/key-stat-mobile-games-to-take-over-70-of-chinas-gaming-market-in-2020](https://kr-asia.com/key-stat-mobile-games-to-take-over-70-of-chinas-gaming-market-in-2020)",

This charging network should also benefit from the recently passed Biden infrastructure plan (See [Lightning Energy](https://lightningenergy.biz/))\n\n Intro video: [Introduction to Lightning eMotors (Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD1mXFSTIEU)\n\n# Recently they reported their Q2 earnings on August 15.

Full article is very detailed and a recommend to read fully.\n\n**Short term Risks:**\n\nHC Approval. In the short term, it\u2019s all that matters effectively.

For those less inclined to await approval, the intermediate and longer term upside would remain significant, even from those levels, giving a pre-approval *risky* investment or a significantly less risky post-approval investment.\n\nThe business model is extraordinary (discussed below), so if the company executes anywhere near plan, this will be a hyper-growth company that will be a \"must own\" over the next few years as the Graphene industry develops.\n\n**An IP Play on an Innovative Nano-Material, Not a Mining Company:**\n\nZEN was a mining company. It is now an IP nano materials play (\u201cgraphene-enhanced\u201d technology). The company recently announced it is asking shareholders to approve a change to their industry status with the stock market and that it will seek to move to a bigger exchange, hopefully in the US. The company has a graphite deposit which is at the development stage, which costs very little to maintain for now and which won\u2019t be mined for many years, if ever. I expect de minimis expenses for the deposit for the foreseeable future.\n\n**Three Initial Target Markets:**\n\n*Prevention, Detection and Treatment*\n\n1. Personal Protective Equipment (\"PPE,\" e.g., masks, gowns, caps, booties, nitrile gloves (hospitals and restaurants, etc.) and Air Filtration (e.g., HVAC filters),\n2. Detection/Sensors (e.g., game-changing rapid, inexpensive and high accuracy COVID testing, with other tests behind that, such as STDs (a huge and rapidly growing problem), certain types of cancer and other diseases/viruses) and\n3. Therapeutics - both topical and ingested, but that's longer term in nature due to regulatory hurdles and could be tremendous, but let\u2019s leave that for another time. In addition, there are many other potential applications, such as fuel additives to improve efficiency, paints to reduce ice on plane wings, and countless other applications.\n\n**Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):**\n\nZEN\u2019s first market will be the application of its formula to surgical and other masks. The effect of their formula is innovative and game-changing: it is to be applied on an additional layer of mask, which essentially grabs the particle (the formula is hydrophilic) when it hits the mask (either coming at the wearer or from the wearer) and then render it harmless.\n\nThe next PPE application will be for nitrile gloves. Given the tremendous threat posed by MERSA, alone, it seems logical that the company\u2019s customers ultimately also will apply ZEN\u2019s formula to surgical caps, gowns and booties.\n\n**Air Filtration, Air Conditioning Filters:**\n\nThis is an enormous market, with various industry reports reporting it in the many billions of dollars. That\u2019s when things are \u201cnormal\u201d (i.e., pre-COVID). If the mask market is a company-maker, the A/C filtration market is a barn burner. There are millions of office buildings in the US and Canada.\n\nThere are over 6,000 hospitals.\n\nThere are over 21,000 nursing homes and elder care facilities.\n\nThere are airports, airplanes, trains, subways, restaurants, theaters, malls - all are high traffic, often densely packed and require the best quality filters on the market.\n\nAnd all are desperate for solutions to create a safe environment to bring back business.\n\n**Detection and Sensors:**\n\nThe company\u2019s product (separate from the AgO-2 solution) provides next generation rapid, saliva-based antigen detection. In about 8 minutes and at very low cost per test, according to the company, the product uses a patent-pending DNA aptamer that recognizes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein simply through a saliva test.\n\nImagine going to an indoor concert today with 1000s of other people packed in in close proximity and no masks? What if for something like a $10 ticket surcharge, you could arrive at a pre-assigned time (let's say an extra 10-30 min early, depending on the size of the venue and number of entrances), get tested, have a highly accurate answer in 8 min, and then go in to the concert, free of concerns that the 100s of people anywhere near you and the 1000s in the auditorium have COVID.\n\nPlease see the company\u2019s presentation for more details: [ZEN Graphene Solutions](https://www.zengraphene.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021_08ZEN-Investor-Presentation.pdf). The solution appears to be scalable, accurate (making PCR tests look awful) and has the added benefit that aptamers can be adapted to be used for many diseases, well beyond COVID. It's a tremendous market opportunity for the company that cracks this nut and also a very high margin business.\n\n**Therapeutics:**\n\nDown the road, the company is looking to enter the therapeutics market, including both topical and ingested applications. Management believes this market opportunity may be even larger than the aforementioned markets. As these take time to enter and will not drive revenue in the near-term, but also won\u2019t cost much to pursue in the short term, I\u2019ll address them at a later time.\n\n**The Model:**\n\nThe company has initiated a pilot line and is producing roughly 1 million masks per day (1M mpd). The company is also building out a 25M mpd facility nearby their offices that is scheduled to begin ramping production in Nov. The same coating should be applied to many different use cases, so the company thinks about sales in \u201cmasks equivalent\u201d (\u201cme\u201d). For instance, if a typical industrial air filter is 3m x 3m (my slightly educated guess), that would require roughly 100me.\n\n**Margins:**\n\nAssuming GM north of 80%, given that graphite (the underlying commodity) is cheap and plentiful, we\u2019re talking about a nano-material, so very small quantities are required relative to output and revenue.\n\n**OP's Note:** They are currently purchasing Graphene-oxide from a third-party to fullfill production, but anticipate a scaling-up of in-house production over the next year. Price of purchase is proprietary according to Exec. Dir. but claim that their studies of the material they are purchasing fit the bill for the mask-coatings.\n\n**Expenses:**\n\nExpect the company to be running at about $300K per month in opex, which already allows for running the new facility since most of it is automated machinery. Per [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiNxl9nMuZ4) Aug. 11th, opex was $200K/month, but given what the Chairman recently said on a public [investor](https://zoom.us/rec/play/o0pa1AWvr7JeqA8NB9eYv-msGZT6lyORYdfPNtQv0WsGV_xBAQeWx9kktlZAAW3_atTsk3TGZEAB3q1J.f6gqjOS0h0D6ZxTw?continueMode=true&amp;tk=BC-G9Hc3b6WfHM3UmFy3BtwyvR54zN_0CLWXDs2uJ94.DQMAAAAWnR6e9RZvMncxdTZNNVJwbVBlNDBFNUlkV1Z3AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA&amp;uuid=WN_Mt_sG54lRg2JoK-vzA8ctA&amp;_x_zm_rtaid=LzQDuI2dSS2ES6R-FeKTXQ.1629297669865.7b102740d4e41e5d6637da3088f7c22a&amp;_x_zm_rhtaid=39) call, they\u2019re hiring at least a few heads.\n\nFor the sake of conservatism, assume that given the massive ramp in revenue and profitability, they\u2019ll end up spending more than that, so double their current opex number to $400K.\n\n**Capex:**\n\nAssume capex will be around $5M-ish, a good bit of which already has been spent. Regardless, the number is so low as to be inconsequential if the company is generating the kind of cash flow, it will, given their current cash position of something just over $4M plus a bit more than that amount in warrants, many of which are in the money and some of which have acceleration clauses; roughly $8M-ish+, all in, vs a very low burn rate.\n\nObviously, since they\u2019re only beginning to ramp and generate revenue, there is a wide range of profit possibilities. Based on what co has said: Assuming the company makes something toward 4c/mask, based on what would be a conservative assumption, which is using the lower end of the midpoint of the revenue per mask the company mentions in its presentation, which you can review, as noted, above.\n\nLet\u2019s say that at some point in 1H:2022 they\u2019re selling out the 25M mpd. That\u2019s:\n\n25M mpd equivalent x .04 = $1M/day in revenue\n\nx 80%+ GM = $800K/day GP (all numbers in Canadian Dollars)\n\nx 30 days/mo = $24M/mo GP -$400K/mo opex (using low end of what management has said)\n\n= $23.6M EBITDA per month x 12 months = $283.2M EBITDA / year -27% tax rate = $206.7M in Net Income /99M shares (fully diluted) = C$2.09 annualized run rate EPS (approx. $1.66 in USD)\n\n(the company has a $30M NOL that will reduce this on first earnings)\n\n**Balance Sheet:**\n\nWith $4M in cash and more than that in in-the-money warrants, some of which have accelerator clauses, the Company doesn\u2019t need capital. Assuming they get HC approval, are generating meaningful rev and cash flow and want to improve the company\u2019s public profile, I could definitely see this Street-savvy management team raising capital opportunistically.\n\nI\u2019m okay with that: a company that doesn\u2019t need to raise money won\u2019t be forced to do so at unattractive prices, like so many small cap companies. A company growing rapidly with their business accelerating and a long runway will have investors clamoring to get in at scale, so deal terms should be very attractive for all parties involved. Since they don\u2019t need money, they can be opportunistic about whether and at what price they might consider a deal.\n\nIf they continue to hit milestones, any such deal would only be done at multiples of the current price. (Yes, I know that sounds like every other small cap dream, but if you dig into this one, you\u2019ll see it\u2019s quite rational.) Anticipate that the company will seek uplisting on the US markets later this year if Sep 27th shareholder vote passes through.\n\n**Misc:**\n\nLock-up expiration behind us: There was a deal in the spring. The lock up expiration is now well behind us (early Aug).\n\n**Insider Buying:**\n\nThe CEO recently bought 50,000 shares (over $100,000) in the open market. He's already the largest shareholder, owning about 4% of the company. I see this as a vote of confidence in ZEN's prospects of winning HC approval.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n* ZEN is an IP play with a strong management team and an outstanding business model and is creating game-changing \u201cmust have\u201d products, rather than \u201cnice to have\u201d ones.\n* ZEN makes an innovative, proprietary, patent pending silver graphene oxide (AgGO-2) formulation at the nano-scale that will be applied to various materials for many applications.\n* Revenues should start very soon, incremental margins should be very attractive and the company should be profitable and CF+ imminently, *possibly* earning their market cap within a year.\n* If things play out according to base case, the stock should trade at a minimum of C$40+ within 12-24 months, returning well over 10x.\n* ZEN potentially has a very long and steep growth trajectory that could last a very long time. This is the best idea I've seen in years.",

What if for something like a $10 ticket surcharge, you could arrive at a pre-assigned time (let's say an extra 10-30 min early, depending on the size of the venue and number of entrances), get tested, have a highly accurate answer in 8 min, and then go in to the concert, free of concerns that the 100s of people anywhere near you and the 1000s in the auditorium have COVID.\n\nPlease see the company\u2019s presentation for more details: [ZEN Graphene Solutions](https://www.zengraphene.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021_08ZEN-Investor-Presentation.pdf). The solution appears to be scalable, accurate (making PCR tests look awful) and has the added benefit that aptamers can be adapted to be used for many diseases, well beyond COVID. It's a tremendous market opportunity for the company that cracks this nut and also a very high margin business.\n\n**Therapeutics:**\n\nDown the road, the company is looking to enter the therapeutics market, including both topical and ingested applications. Management believes this market opportunity may be even larger than the aforementioned markets. As these take time to enter and will not drive revenue in the near-term, but also won\u2019t cost much to pursue in the short term, I\u2019ll address them at a later time.\n\n**The Model:**\n\nThe company has initiated a pilot line and is producing roughly 1 million masks per day (1M mpd). The company is also building out a 25M mpd facility nearby their offices that is scheduled to begin ramping production in Nov. The same coating should be applied to many different use cases, so the company thinks about sales in \u201cmasks equivalent\u201d (\u201cme\u201d). For instance, if a typical industrial air filter is 3m x 3m (my slightly educated guess), that would require roughly 100me.\n\n**Margins:**\n\nAssuming GM north of 80%, given that graphite (the underlying commodity) is cheap and plentiful, we\u2019re talking about a nano-material, so very small quantities are required relative to output and revenue.\n\n**OP's Note:** They are currently purchasing Graphene-oxide from a third-party to fullfill production, but anticipate a scaling-up of in-house production over the next year. Price of purchase is proprietary according to Exec. Dir. but claim that their studies of the material they are purchasing fit the bill for the mask-coatings.\n\n**Expenses:**\n\nExpect the company to be running at about $300K per month in opex, which already allows for running the new facility since most of it is automated machinery. Per [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiNxl9nMuZ4) Aug. 11th, opex was $200K/month, but given what the Chairman recently said on a public [investor](https://zoom.us/rec/play/o0pa1AWvr7JeqA8NB9eYv-msGZT6lyORYdfPNtQv0WsGV_xBAQeWx9kktlZAAW3_atTsk3TGZEAB3q1J.f6gqjOS0h0D6ZxTw?continueMode=true&amp;tk=BC-G9Hc3b6WfHM3UmFy3BtwyvR54zN_0CLWXDs2uJ94.DQMAAAAWnR6e9RZvMncxdTZNNVJwbVBlNDBFNUlkV1Z3AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA&amp;uuid=WN_Mt_sG54lRg2JoK-vzA8ctA&amp;_x_zm_rtaid=LzQDuI2dSS2ES6R-FeKTXQ.1629297669865.7b102740d4e41e5d6637da3088f7c22a&amp;_x_zm_rhtaid=39) call, they\u2019re hiring at least a few heads.\n\nFor the sake of conservatism, assume that given the massive ramp in revenue and profitability, they\u2019ll end up spending more than that, so double their current opex number to $400K.\n\n**Capex:**\n\nAssume capex will be around $5M-ish, a good bit of which already has been spent. Regardless, the number is so low as to be inconsequential if the company is generating the kind of cash flow, it will, given their current cash position of something just over $4M plus a bit more than that amount in warrants, many of which are in the money and some of which have acceleration clauses; roughly $8M-ish+, all in, vs a very low burn rate.\n\nObviously, since they\u2019re only beginning to ramp and generate revenue, there is a wide range of profit possibilities. Based on what co has said: Assuming the company makes something toward 4c/mask, based on what would be a conservative assumption, which is using the lower end of the midpoint of the revenue per mask the company mentions in its presentation, which you can review, as noted, above.\n\nLet\u2019s say that at some point in 1H:2022 they\u2019re selling out the 25M mpd. That\u2019s:\n\n25M mpd equivalent x .04 = $1M/day in revenue\n\nx 80%+ GM = $800K/day GP (all numbers in Canadian Dollars)\n\nx 30 days/mo = $24M/mo GP -$400K/mo opex (using low end of what management has said)\n\n= $23.6M EBITDA per month x 12 months = $283.2M EBITDA / year -27% tax rate = $206.7M in Net Income /99M shares (fully diluted) = C$2.09 annualized run rate EPS (approx. $1.66 in USD)\n\n(the company has a $30M NOL that will reduce this on first earnings)\n\n**Balance Sheet:**\n\nWith $4M in cash and more than that in in-the-money warrants, some of which have accelerator clauses, the Company doesn\u2019t need capital. Assuming they get HC approval, are generating meaningful rev and cash flow and want to improve the company\u2019s public profile, I could definitely see this Street-savvy management team raising capital opportunistically.\n\nI\u2019m okay with that: a company that doesn\u2019t need to raise money won\u2019t be forced to do so at unattractive prices, like so many small cap companies. A company growing rapidly with their business accelerating and a long runway will have investors clamoring to get in at scale, so deal terms should be very attractive for all parties involved. Since they don\u2019t need money, they can be opportunistic about whether and at what price they might consider a deal.\n\nIf they continue to hit milestones, any such deal would only be done at multiples of the current price. (Yes, I know that sounds like every other small cap dream, but if you dig into this one, you\u2019ll see it\u2019s quite rational.) Anticipate that the company will seek uplisting on the US markets later this year if Sep 27th shareholder vote passes through.\n\n**Misc:**\n\nLock-up expiration behind us: There was a deal in the spring. The lock up expiration is now well behind us (early Aug).\n\n**Insider Buying:**\n\nThe CEO recently bought 50,000 shares (over $100,000) in the open market. He's already the largest shareholder, owning about 4% of the company. I see this as a vote of confidence in ZEN's prospects of winning HC approval.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n* ZEN is an IP play with a strong management team and an outstanding business model and is creating game-changing \u201cmust have\u201d products, rather than \u201cnice to have\u201d ones.\n* ZEN makes an innovative, proprietary, patent pending silver graphene oxide (AgGO-2) formulation at the nano-scale that will be applied to various materials for many applications.\n* Revenues should start very soon, incremental margins should be very attractive and the company should be profitable and CF+ imminently, *possibly* earning their market cap within a year.\n* If things play out according to base case, the stock should trade at a minimum of C$40+ within 12-24 months, returning well over 10x.\n* ZEN potentially has a very long and steep growth trajectory that could last a very long time. This is the best idea I've seen in years.",

After global pandemic situations gets a little better now with the aid of vaccination, CCP does not even allow issuing passport visa for its people to leave country. Example is, foreign students are restricted to fly to United States to resume their education. What they are trying to adopt is, keeping all the people, money and resources within the border of country, with minimal help from foreign countries. Wealthy people from China are doing whatever it takes to bring money to oversea, but it's within stricter control and  closer monitoring of CCP than ever. The idea of communism is to remove the inequality of free market and the gap between rich and poor. It's unfair to the wealthier ones that are willing to put in effort to make a better life but it is what it is. With the global food shortage we eventually have to face, I have heard rumor of China stacking food within its own country as it refuses to rely on global trade with countries that are not their allies. \n\nWith all that said, I am not sure how it may affect the US market or global market.

This post contains no technical analysis, no charts, no p/e, or any of that sort so if you\u2019re that kinda guy this may not be for you, just basic fundamentals and why I think this stock is gonna be many multiples of its current price in eoy, and in 1-5 years time.\n\nSo Comstock Mining is a, mining company located in Nevada in the famous Comstock Lode. They are currently not operating any mine. They did back in 2012-2016 but ultimately it didn\u2019t prove to be worth it due to low gold prices and high costs.\n\n  \n\nSo what are they doing? Lets start with MCU.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n\n**MCU ( Mercury clean up )** \n\nArtisanal and small scale miners still use mercury in huge amounts, because its cost effective to them. Problem is, it is hugely toxic and doesn\u2019t break down on its own. What MCU does is take the dirty soils out of the ground and cleanses them, capturing any mercury and gold left in that soil. The systems are mobile, so when they are done with one project, they can simply ship the unit to the next. Costs are ridiculously good for a mine project, each system and its workers, peripherals etc costs roughly 3m$, they don\u2019t require decade long permits to start a project, unlike normal mines. Comstock currently is operating its very 1st project in the Philippines. There are 2 systems total, one ( project system) in the Comstock Lode, Nevada and one in the Philippines. The Comstock system does only about 25ton/ per hour max, as it is a purely ment to prove this technology. The one in the Philippines does 150 ton/hour, so it is much much faster.\n\nThey also clean up the sand and gravel which then can be sold. They have stated many times, that they can be net positive with only sand and gravel, with no gold. But they have seen gold grades ranging between 1g/ton to 7g/ton in the Philippines. The plan is to have more systems along the Naboc river in the Philippines, from 3 to 4 systems more is something they have said. So imagine a ONE system being able to generate 1m a month ( a figure they have said in calls, being very conservative and that\u2019s with NO GOLD!) the potential here is tremendous.\n\nPhillipines project is estimated to last anywhere from 5 to 9 years, so very long projects.\n\nThey have also been in talks with the government and many more countries. It is a worldwide problem really and they are in UNIQUE position as no one else has this kind of technology.\n\nLODE owns 25% of MCU and 62,5% of the Philippines project.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n\n**LiNiCo \u2013 Lithium recycling**\n\nIn February 2021 Comstock announced the acquisition of 64% of LiNiCo. Linico owns a lithium ion battery recycling plant in Nevada ( ex aqua metals plant), near teslas Gigafactory. It is capaple of recycling a 100.000 tons per annum when in full production, making it the BIGGEST recycling plant in America. They are already taking pre-orders for start up in the 2nd Quarter 2022. Below are the guidance numbers, remember, LODE owns 64%. And those numbers are from produced black mass ALONE. LiNiCo has a 20% stake in Singapore based Green Li-ion which produces 99,99% pure cathodes from the black mass, it is highly more valuable than black mass alone, no numbers given on that as far as I know. They can also produce pure lithium out of the black mass, something no one else is capable of.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5fpt47v4pfl71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1c9d5a0124760945f4ebd85e9f851ad7f7b171f\n\nJust to give some context on LiNiCo\u2019s competition: ABML \u2013 Worth over 1 billion, hasn\u2019t even started building their plant yet. Li-Cycle 1.3B, LiNiCo will produce much more than they do. Redwood is private. Based on just that LiNiCo is very undervalued, the transaction was valued at 17m$ for LODE. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n\n**Renewable process solutions ( RPS )**\n\n[**https://www.comstockmining.com/press-releases/comstock-acquires-renewable-process-solutions/**](https://www.comstockmining.com/press-releases/comstock-acquires-renewable-process-solutions/)\n\nThis one ties this together in my opinion. RPS is an engineering, procurement company. It has built 21 renewable fuel production facilities since 2006. LODE originally quoted an state of the art german manufacturer to build LiNiCo\u2019s crushing, separating machines for LIB recycling, costing over 9m\u20ac with long waiting times, RPS came to picture, engineered better machines for less than a 5m$ with much less lead time. They also made technological breakthroughs as LiNiCo\u2019s original capacity was quoted to be 20.000 tons per annum, they\u2019ve now upgraded it to 100k. So LODE now has IN HOUSE engineering capability, reducing costs dramatically. I believe we are gonna hear from RPS in every line of their business. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n\n**Hemp &amp; Lakeview Energy** \n\n**https://www.comstockmining.com/press-releases/comstock-forms-joint-venture-with-lakeview-energy/**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3nywbni9pfl71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7eebdc54d5316950a6225cd46aaa7dfd784a3590\n\nTheir newest acquisition. Just gonna quote what is said in that pr, since this is so new, nothing else is known. \n\nComstock Mining Inc. (NYSE: LODE) (\u201cComstock\u201d and the \u201cCompany\u201d) today announced the execution of a series of agreements with Lakeview Energy LLC (\u201cLakeview\u201d) and its subsidiaries, pursuant to which the Company acquired 50% of the equity of Lakeview\u2019s subsidiary, LP Biosciences LLC (\u201cLPB\u201d), and agreed to provide the financing needed to retrofit LPB\u2019s pre-existing industrial scale solvent extraction and valorization facility in Merrill, Iowa (\u201cLPB Facility\u201d), for the production of an array of wholesale products from up to 200,000 pounds per day of industrial hemp. ( RPS is bidding on the construction, fitting of these machines ) \n\n**Industry Leading Scale, Quality, Compliance, and Flexibility**\n\nComstock\u2019s Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Corrado DeGasperis, added: \u201cWe are proud to have assembled a world class asset with a team of industry veterans, process engineers, and partners to rapidly retrofit and commence operations with the LPB Facility, thereby setting a global standard for quality, compliance, consistency, flexibility and speed at an extraordinary scale. Once retrofits are complete in mid-2022, the LPB Facility will generate significant free cash flow by servicing the most astute, demanding, and rapidly growing buyers of wholesale hemp products with custom tailored solutions.\u201d\n\nThe LPB Facility is conservatively expected to scale up to its initial nameplate capacity exceeding 200,000 pounds per day and 36,500 tons per year of industrial hemp over its first three years of operations, as it extracts, remediates, and refines oil from industrial hemp to generate annualized revenues exceeding $53,000,000, $154,000,000, and $409,000,000 per year during LPB\u2019s first, second, and third full years of operations, respectively, as shown in the following excerpt from LPB\u2019s internal projections:\n\n**Quantum Computing**\n\n**https://www.comstockmining.com/latest-developments/comstock-invests-15000000-in-initial-seed-round-for-quantum-computing-to-accelerate-material-science-discovery-and-development/**\n\nThis is one big mystery yet, not much is know. I think this is a statement how serious they are in their line of businesses, especially in recycling. They are not just recycling, I think they are innovating. They(GenMat) are in Stealth mode. Direct Wikipedia quote \u201c In business, **stealth mode** is a company's temporary state of secretiveness, usually undertaken to avoid alerting competitors to a pending product launch or another business initiative\u201d\n\nQuote from PR:\n\n\u201c\u201cQuantum computing has the profound potential to resolve urgent challenges of our time, such as global resource scarcity and climate change,\u201d said Corrado De Gasperis, Comstock\u2019s Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \u201cWe have been working for some time on the frontier of new materials development with GenMat\u2019s world-class team and network of quantum computing professionals and material scientists. We believe that their work will make many positive and disruptive contributions, especially in our existing and planned industries. We are honored to participate and provide funding and commercialization support to such an exceptional and growing team of transformational professionals.\u201d\n\nWhile GenMat\u2019s intended offerings will be industry agnostic when it emerges from stealth mode, Comstock is laser focused on applications that accelerate the development of new clean technologies to address resource scarcity by facilitating climate smart mining, electrification, and decarbonization. Consequently, in addition to its investment, Comstock also secured exclusive rights to use GenMat\u2019s quantum technologies to complement and enhance its existing operations and planned technological and new business developments\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n\nUpcoming catalysts\n\nThere is just so much going on that this could go on pages, but I stop here and add some near/mid term catalysts.\n\n\\- them announcing MCU revenue and guidance ( they started in early march, had bad weather, floods, had to reposition few times, 5 weeks delay on some permit oversight) I think its coming soon, they stated they wanted to wait 3 to 4 months before announcing anything, it could be soon.\n\n\\- Dayton SK-1300 release. So I didn\u2019t talk anything about their Dayton resource because I think its not going to be their core business frankly. SK-1300 is a mineral estimate report, It was stated to be released in mid 2021 so it could be any day. They did a magnetic survey of their Dayton/spring valley area and are updating the results soon. I believe this could be a significant catalyst.\n\n\\- Them announcing partners with linico. I 100% believe there is going to be partnership with tesla. They need the battery materials badly, they are literally almost next to each other. Both of them talk about closed loop system, which only makes sense really.\n\n\\- Selling of non mining assets. LODE owns a silver springs property that has been on sale for quite some time, almost 3 years. Delayed atleast a dozen times, the transaction is supposed to go through soon, netting them 13m$.\n\n\\- They have partnership with Tonogold (TNGL) tono pays them monthly interest and big reimbursement next march worth 7m$.\n\n\\- LODE owns roughly 9 million of tono stock ( TNGL 0,13$ per share atm ) \n\n\\- they are under an NDA, Corrado said in Q2 call that we\u2019ll get \u201cClarity\u201d in September/ October time so soon.\n\nIf you got interested PLEASE watch their latest Q2/Q1/annual meeting videos, highly informative and im sure I missed a lot. They have deep joint venture with Tonogold which I didn\u2019t talk about much coz I think its stil long way off. But they own BIG royalties on one of the most richest places on the Comstock lode. Videos tell more on that.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-312zsm6nf4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-312zsm6nf4)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIQZssNbbJU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIQZssNbbJU)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sE9YNJbRmhM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sE9YNJbRmhM)\n\nnot long videos. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCheers. My 1st post and \"DD\" so thats that. I held this through 2019 RS, current position is 12 000 shares with 0,8 avg. I truly believe there is dividends in the future if things go as planned.

        "selftext": "ARK Investment Management is looking to debut a new ETF that will focus on transparency in companies and shun vice and sectors that run afoul of sustainable investing like fossil fuels.\n\nIn an SEC filing, Cathie Wood's shop outlines the fund, which looks to be at least 80% invested in stocks in its benchmark Transparency Index, published by Solactive.\n\n\"Companies operating in the following industries, as determined by the Index provider, are excluded from the Index: (i) alcohol, (ii) banking, (iii) chemicals, (iv) confectionary, (v) fossil fuel transportation, (vi) gambling, (vii) metals, (viii) mineral, (ix) natural gas, (x) oil, and (xi) tobacco,\" ARK says in its filing.\n\nIf approved, the ETF would be the second that Ark has launched this year. In March, the company started a fund focused on space-related investments, which has risen about 4% since its debut and now has more than $600 million in assets. Meanwhile, the firm\u2019s flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) is up to $22.5 billion, although it\u2019s down 2% year-to-date -- compared with a gain of more than 20% for the S&amp;P 500.",

        "selftext": "I   owned some shares of QTS preferred A series stock. When Blackstone    acquired QTS I assumed the stock would simply transfer to a new issue    via Blackstone. It appears instead that I simply am unable to trade the    shares I own, at least that's how it appears in my Fidelity account.   From the announcement today:\n\n&gt;Following  the closing of its acquisition on August 31, 2021  by affiliates of  Blackstone Infrastructure Partners, Blackstone Real  Estate Income  Trust, Inc. and Blackstone Property Partners, QTS Realty  Trust (\"QTS\")  announced that holders of its 6.50% Series A Cumulative  Convertible  Perpetual Preferred Limited Liability Company Units (the  \"New Series A  Preferred Units\") will have the right, until the close of  business on  October 14, 2021, to convert each New Series A Preferred Unit into  $172.84 in cash. Thereafter, holders of New Series A Preferred Units  will have the right to convert each unit into $167.40  in cash. At the  closing of the acquisition, each outstanding share of  QTS 6.50% Series B  Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock was  automatically  converted into one New Series A Preferred Unit.  \nAdditional   information regarding the conversion is included in a notice of   occurrence of a fundamental change that has been distributed to holders   of New Series A Preferred Units. Holders who wish to convert their New   Series A Preferred Units should contact their broker, bank or other   nominee. Computershare is serving as the conversion agent and can be   contacted at c/o Computershare, Voluntary Corporate Actions, 150 Royall   Street Suite V, Canton, MA 02021 or \\[redacted email\\]\n\nIt  appears I should be able to convert the shares to cash but Fidelity  seems not to be able to handle that, at least not via the app. Does  anyone know the way to go about this?",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 6th, 2021.\n\n# **Stocks could look right past the weak jobs report and focus on strong profits - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/03/stocks-could-look-right-past-the-weak-jobs-report-to-another-strong-earnings-season.html)**\n*****\n&gt; With Jackson Hole in the rear-view mirror, August\u2019s employment report could be the next driver for markets.\n*****\n&gt; After a weak jobs report, strategists say investor focus may stay on strong profit growth rather than other potential negatives.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were mixed in the past week ahead of the long Labor Day weekend, with the Nasdaq outperforming, the S&amp;P 500 rising slightly and the Dow flat. The best-performing sectors were on the defensive side, led by real estate investment trusts, utilities, consumer staples and health care.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYou\u2019ve got this Labor Day effect. People are back from vacation\u201d in the coming week, National Securities chief market strategist Art Hogan said.\n*****\n&gt; Hogan said investors expect the trading activity to pick up as a result, but it typically remains slow in the holiday shortened-week. Investors may assess their summer performance and move to lock in gains or add hedges.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf you look back at the last five post-Labor Day weeks that have happened with the market near all-time highs, the post Labor Day week is the worst for September,\u201d Hogan said.\n*****\n&gt; # Year-to-date returns\n*****\n&gt; https://i.imgur.com/I2dgbkQ.png\n*****\n&gt; Friday\u2019s disappointing August jobs report \u2014 with just 235,000 jobs added \u2014 was a dampener for sentiment, but stocks were mixed.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMy outlook for the last several weeks is sideways to moderately higher, and that seems where they\u2019re headed. There isn\u2019t a lot of bearish data accumulating. At worst we go sideways,\u201d said Randy Frederick, Charles Schwab managing director of trading and derivatives.\n*****\n&gt; Frederick said even with worries about the weaker jobs and Covid,-19 investors may continue to focus on profits. Economists blamed the spread of the Covid delta variant for the weaker than expected jobs report.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists say other issues for stocks in September could include the efforts in Congress to pass infrastructure legislation and possible new taxes.\n*****\n&gt; # Ignoring jobs report\n*****\n&gt; Frederick said he expects the market to look beyond the August employment report, which was about 500,000 lower than expected.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s spillover much into next week for the most part,\u201d he added. \u201cThe markets are down a little bit, but I think they\u2019ve taken it in stride better than might be expected.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Weekly jobless claims data Thursday could be even more important than usual because of the big miss in August\u2019s employment report. Jobs data is important because that is one area where Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said he would like to see more improvement before the central bank can decide to slow its bond purchases.\n*****\n&gt; The market has been fixated on the Fed\u2019s move to end its $120 billion a month bond-buying program because it is viewed as a precursor to interest rate hikes. However, Powell has stressed the two are not linked.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf feels like [the jobs report] pushes the announcement of a taper to the November meeting, rather than the September meeting, and for the most part that was consensus,\u201d Hogan said.\n*****\n&gt; Hogan said the market will also be watching any inflation-related data, so that makes Fridays\u2019 producer price index important after it surged last month. The consumer price index, released the following week, will be even more important for the market.\n*****\n&gt; NatWest Markets head of macro strategy John Briggs said the markets will be watching for any Fed-related headlines after the disappointing employment report.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cNext week, you have [New York Fed President John] Williams speaking. His take will be important. He\u2019s viewed as being close to Powell,\u201d Briggs said. Williams is set to speak Wednesday at a briefing on the economy.\n*****\n&gt; # What\u2019s next for stocks\n*****\n&gt; Besides the Fed, the next big event for stocks will be the third-quarter earnings season, which gets underway in early October. Before that, investors will be watching for any company comments on results.\n*****\n&gt; Frederick said the strength of earnings has been propelling stocks and could keep doing so. \u2033The market was so overvalued for awhile until earnings caught up, but earnings were spectacular and now the valuations aren\u2019t as high as they were a few months ago, so we can do this,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings are expected to increase by 29.8% for the third quarter after the second quarter\u2019s stunning 95.6% increase, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s a vacuum of earnings related news,\u201d Frederick said, noting the market could be influenced by geopolitical events in the meantime.\n*****\n&gt; But even if the market loses steam, he doesn\u2019t expect a major sell-off because for now, dip buyers continue to come in whenever the market has a setback.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week up 0.6% at 4,535, versus a 1.5% move higher by the Nasdaq to 15,363, a new high. The Dow was flattish, off 0.2%, at 35,369.\n*****\n&gt; The closely watched 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.32% late Friday, just above where it was a week ago.\n*****\n&gt; https://i.imgur.com/K44V7RZ.png\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/RQEZvdB.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/sQGgDYb.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/LFCW7DN.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/dPxu4zt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/JNw8ELe.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CTw0TPL.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9Nvv3H6.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/G2fLYs4.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/hdl8c3o.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wLwUeqE.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/vaBKcIq.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/8pqcEfu.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/kBuPG6D.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Weakness Day After Labor Day &amp; Sell Rosh Hashanah\n\n&gt; In the last 21 years, only Russell 2000 has registered an average gain of 0.04% on the Tuesday after the long Labor Day weekend. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have struggled with negative average performance. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have been up five of the last nine years, but DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 all have fallen for the last four years on Tuesday. On Wednesday the market\u2019s performance has been varied. DJIA has performed the best, up 76.2% of the time with an average gain of 0.33%. S&amp;P 500 is worst, up only 47.6% of the time with an average gain of 0.25%. NASDAQ has a better record up 52.4% of the time on Wednesday, but a smaller average gain of 0.14%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/6a21f54090531d6af040908d26933cf6/3527e5164e79635b-f2/s500x750/6a6618593a7e03b8f169df02f72c6a0a63c53430.jpg))**\n\n&gt; **Sell Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur**\n\n&gt; As the High Holidays approach you may remember the old saying on the Street, \u201cSell Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur.\u201d It gets tossed around every autumn when the \u201chigh holidays\u201d are on the minds of traders as many of their Jewish colleagues take off to observe the Jewish New Year and Day of Atonement.\n\n&gt; The basis for this, \u201cSell Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur,\u201d pattern is that with many traders and investors busy with religious observance and family, positions are closed out and volume fades creating a buying vacuum. Even in the age of algorithmic, computer, and high frequency trading these seasonal patterns persist as humans still need to turn the machines on and off and feed them money or take it away \u2013 and these algorithms and trading programs are written by people so the human influence is still there.\n\n&gt; Holiday seasonality around official market holidays is something we pay close attention to (page 98 Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac 2021). Actual stats on the most observed Hebrew holidays have been compiled in the table here. We present the data back to 1971 and when the holiday falls on a weekend the prior market close is used. It\u2019s no coincidence that Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur fall in September and/or October, two dangerous and sometimes opportune months.\n\n&gt; Perhaps it\u2019s Talmudic wisdom but, selling stocks before the eight-day span of the high holidays has avoided many declines, especially during uncertain times. While being long Yom Kippur to Passover has produced 64% more advances, half as many losses and average gains of 7.0%. This past year DJIA gained 19.9% from Yom Kippur 2020 to Passover 2021.\n\n&gt; This year the high holidays arrive early on Labor Day eve, September 6, and end Thursday September 16 with Yom Kippur at mid-month one of the strongest days September. But with the market in full rally mode on easy Federal Reserve money and free Federal Government fiscal stimulus month selling ahead of the Jewish High Holidays could trigger a mild correction of 5% or so. The end of September after Triple Witching is notoriously the weakest part of the month, so it may be more prudent to \u201cbuy\u201d later in the month.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/f48b419f71e6b43083843cc8c9eb649b/3527e5164e79635b-8b/s1280x1920/7c4dac70ddf513ac44ee0c3ca901b9d588c20d51.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Here Comes the Worst Month of the Year\n\n&gt; The incredible bull market continues, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up to a record 53 new all-time highs before August is over, topping the previous record from 1964.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8.31.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cAlthough this bull market has laughed at nearly all the worry signs in 2021, let\u2019s not forget that September is historically the worst month of the year for stocks,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cEven last year, in the face of a huge rally off the March 2020 lows, we saw a nearly 10% correction in the middle of September.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8.31.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 hasn\u2019t had so much as a 5% correction since last October and with stocks up more than 100% since March 2020, investors should be open to some potential seasonal weakness. The good news is we remain in the camp that stocks will continue to go higher and investors should use any weakness as an opportunity to add to core equity holdings.\n\n&gt; Let\u2019s be honest, stocks can\u2019t go up forever. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 is about to be up 7 months in a row, one of the longest monthly win streaks ever.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8.31.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It is what happens next that has our attention. As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, after 7-month win streaks, the S&amp;P 500 has been higher six months later 13 out of 14 times, with a very impressive 7.8% average return. This reinforces our belief that in the event of a well-deserved pullback, it would be an opportunity to buy at cheaper prices.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8.31.21-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; With a very highly anticipated Federal Reserve Bank meeting in September, along with continued Delta variant worries, coupled with the fact that stocks haven\u2019t pulled back in a long time, investors should be on the lookout for some seasonal volatility in September. We remain in the camp that any weakness, should it occur, could be short-term and likely be contained in the 5-8% range. This bull market is alive and well and we would view any potential weakness as an opportunity.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # August Payrolls Disappoint\n\n&gt; It seems to be two steps forward, one step back for the U.S. labor market.\n\n&gt; The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released its August employment report this morning, revealing that the domestic economy added a disappointing 235,000 jobs during the month, falling well short of Bloomberg-surveyed economists\u2019 median forecast for a gain of 733,000. This comes on the heels of a strong July during which payrolls climbed by an upwardly revised 1.053 million jobs. The unemployment rate fell to 5.2% in August, in line with expectations, and was paired with an unchanged labor force participation rate, which stayed at 61.7%.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe Delta variant surge is the unsurprising story behind August\u2019s big payroll miss,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cLeisure and hospitality jobs, a proxy for economic reopening, were flat month over month. The good news is that we see promising signs Delta\u2019s effect will wane in coming months and payrolls will resume growing at a fast clip.\u201d\n\n&gt; As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, we remain 5.3 million payrolls shy of February 2020\u2019s peak.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.3.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The other key takeaway from this report is wage pressures are building. Average hourly earnings came in hotter than expected, an increasingly common occurrence, posting a 0.6% month-over-month gain versus expectations for 0.3%, and a 4.3% gain year over year versus expectations for 3.9%. Wages have important implications in the inflation debate, as they and rents are considered to be among the \u201cstickier\u201d components of inflation. Today\u2019s report is likely to bolster those in the camp asserting inflation will be less transitory than the Federal Reserve (Fed) thinks, though it should be noted that the lack of employment growth in lower wage in-person sectors likely contributed to the higher wage numbers.\n\n&gt; Looking ahead, we continue to believe there is reason to expect a strong jobs rebound in coming months. Schools closed for the summer, potential disincentives from enhanced unemployment benefits, and the troublesome Delta variant have all acted as speed limits on the pace of employment growth recently. August\u2019s report, though, figures to be the last where all of these factors remain in full force. Enhanced unemployment benefits are set to expire on Labor Day (ironically), meaning their effects will only be present for part of the September report\u2019s observation window, and will be fully gone by the October report. Schools and daycare facilities, meanwhile, are beginning to reopen, freeing up parents to rejoin the labor force. And, most importantly, we are seeing promising signs that the worst of the latest flare-up in COVID-19 cases may be behind us.\n\n&gt; Zooming out, this job report has the potential to delay the Fed\u2019s tapering timeline. Fed Chair Powell has made it clear that the labor market will serve as his tell regarding when to begin tapering asset purchases. With today\u2019s big payroll miss, it is clear the labor market is under some near term pressure, and while these pressures are likely to dissipate the Fed will probably err on the side of caution to avoid acting prematurely. The next month is sure to be an interesting one for Fed-watchers.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Bullish Sentiment Finally Rises in Back to Back Weeks\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has continued to press higher resulting in a coincident rise in sentiment. The AAII's weekly reading on bullish sentiment rose back above 40% for the first time since the week of July 8th. While 43.4% is not a particularly elevated reading on sentiment (72nd percentile of all periods), the move higher is particularly notable in that it was the first time bullish sentiment has risen in back-to-back weeks since February. That is especially surprising given the fact that bullish sentiment was very elevated at points between now and then, such as back in the spring when it eclipsed 50%. That is also a historically long stretch of time without back-to-back increases in bullish sentiment. As shown in the second chart below, at just over half of a year-long, the only two similar streaks on record were in 1995 and from 1997 to 1998.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/090221-AAII-Bull.png))**\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/090221-AAII-Bull-Back-to-Back.png))**\n\n&gt; Negative sentiment has broadly picked up over the past couple of months. In the AAII survey, bearish sentiment was slightly higher at 33.3% versus 33% last week. While below the peak from only a couple of weeks ago, that is still elevated versus readings from earlier this year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/090221-AAII-Bear.png))**\n\n&gt; Similarly, the Investors Intelligence survey of newsletter writers has also seen bearish sentiment on the rise throughout the summer. This week, it topped 20% for the first time since March 10th. At 21.3%, bearish sentiment in this survey is at the highest level since last October. With that said, the current reading is also well below the 20 year average of 24.19%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/090221-II-Bear.png))**\n\n&gt; As a result of the larger gains to bullish versus bearish sentiment, optimism remains the favored response in the AAII survey. The bull-bear spread rose back into positive double digits this week for the first time since the last week of July.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/090221-AAII-Bull-Bear-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; Given both bullish and bearish sentiments were higher, neutral sentiment has continued to unwind. That reading fell 4.3 percentage points this week to a new low of 23.2%. That was the fourth decline in the past five weeks as neutral sentiment came in at the lowest level since mid-April.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/090221-AAII-Neutral.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Emerging Markets Leave China Behind\n\n&gt; In last night's Closer, we noted the record underperformance of Chinese equities relative to the US over the past six months. As a result of the weakness in Chinese equities, the MSCI Emerging Market ETF (EEM)\u2014which has roughly a 37% weight in Hong Kong and Chinese stocks\u2014is well off of its highs and has been trending lower over the past several months. Today, EEM is up a healthy 1.37%, but that brings it just short of its 50-DMA which recently fell below its 200-DMA. That is also at similar levels to the lower high from the start of this month.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/083121-EEM.png))**\n\n&gt; When factoring out China, emerging markets look much better. Again, the MSCI Emerging Market ETF that excludes China (EMXC) is currently 1.13% below its 52-week high, but the downtrend that has been in place since the early June highs has been on the ropes over the past couple of sessions. Yesterday saw the ETF trade and close right at that downtrend line, but the 1.15% gain today has smashed through it. That leaves EMXC at the highest level since June 15th. The ETF is also at some of the most overbought levels (1.8 standard deviations from its 50-DMA) since then.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/083121-EMXC.png))**\n\n&gt; Pivoting over to bonds, looking at the Fixed Income screen of our Trend Analyzer, the best performer over the past five days is also in the EM space. The USD Emerging Markets Bond ETF (EMB) had been mostly flat throughout the summer trending right alongside its sideways 50- and 200-DMAs. Significant gains last Friday and yesterday led EMB to break out of that range as it reaches some of the highest levels since February today.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/083121-EMB.png))**\n\n&gt; As previously mentioned, EMB has not ventured far from its 50-DMA recently. In fact, the rolling 50-day standard deviation has been right around some of the lowest levels on record since EMB began trading in 2008. Given that lack of volatility, the rip higher this week has resulted in the ETF moving well beyond the upper end of its narrow trading range. In fact, yesterday the ETF closed over 3 standard deviations above its 50-DMA.

Piss off with that. There is no control over the scales or time spans used and it is possible the graphs have been manipulated to present the desired conclusion. At times I think the \u201ceye-balling\u201d was done by a cross-eyed ass-clown jacked to the moobs on crack while spanking the monkey to re-runs of Laverne &amp; Shirley. The sort of guy who beats the bishop in his own Dutch oven. Yeah you just took advice from a guy with an IQ lower than that of a gooseberry.\n\nIn case you are curious the IQ is [2.81](https://www.jetpunk.com/user-quizzes/63858/top-20-iqs-of-fruits).\n\n**What is a correlation?**\n\n[Correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation) measures the degree to which two things move relative to each other. It is a **statistical function** that measures a linear relationship; it is not eye-balled by some crack-taking, Jim Cramer-loving, 1970s sitcom-whacking, glass bottom-wearing savant who failed to get the McMascot job in Buttplug, Idaho.\n\nA correlation value (aka correlation coefficient or R value) is between -1 and +1 inclusive, but is sometimes expressed as a percentage (i.e. -100% &lt;= R &lt;= +100%).\n\n**So what?**\n\nA correlation of +1 means the two things are in lock step, i.e. perfectly correlated. As one moves up, so does the other and vice versa. Think of it like this: between the ages of 1 and 15, as you get older your shoe size also increases, unless your name is Tom Cruise who stopped growing [at age 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lI9CVX4uFSI). This has a correlation of +1. This is like ITM call options: as the price of the underlying stock goes up, then the value of the call option also goes up\u2026.just like the number of tendies. \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\n\nA correlation of -1 means two things move in opposite directions. As one goes up, the other goes down and vice versa. An example: as the stock price increases, the value of the put option decreases. Less tendies.  A perfect negative correlation.\n\nA correlation of 0 means there is no relationship between two independent things.  Think of it like this: if I looked at the ape population for 2021, there would no relationship between daily crayon consumption and the girth of your wife\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s love truncheon. No correlation = random tendies today.\n\n[This ](https://imgur.com/a/6lCiRRZ)is what the correlations look like on a graph:\n\n[......do not read the caption.....](https://preview.redd.it/i72tq6yck2l71.jpg?width=682&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=276ad03476b8951c0caadf77e07db1aadc43a1e1)\n\n**Random Heading Placeholder**\n\nBut you won\u2019t often see perfect positive or negative correlations. You will see values like -0.420 (a relatively weak negative correlation) or +0.69 (a moderately strong positive correlation). The +0.69 value when multiplied by itself gives an R squared value of 0.476 or 47.6%. In this case one variable accounts for about half the movement in the other.\n\n**Limitations of correlation**\n\n* Correlations are based on historical data (such as closing prices or VWAP) and are not predictions of movements in the future.\n* A correlation measures the relative direction of movements, not the size of the movements.\n* Correlation does not imply causation.\n* Whilst it appears there might be a mathematical relationship you might have a [spurious correlation](https://tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations).  For example: from 2000 to 2009 in the USA there is a +0.947 correlation between annual per capita cheese consumption and the number of people who died by getting tangled in their bedsheets. No shit.....but there may have been some on the tangled bedsheets. (Imma let myself out....)\n* No tool should be used in isolation, other statistical tools are available but I can only focus on one thing at once.  Today it is correlations.\n\n**Rough guideline to R values**\n\n* Anything above +0.9 or below -0.9 is very strong,\n* between -0.9 and -0.7 and between +0.7 and +0.9 are strong,\n* other values above 0.5 are moderately strong,\n* anything below 0.5 is weak,\n* close to 0 (e.g. under 0.1) = no relationship.\n\n**How to calculate R**\n\nOpen Excel, paste in the daily data or whatever and then use the CORREL function to calculate the correlation.  If you aren\u2019t sure RTFM.\n\n**Can it be used as a predictor?**\n\nYes it can.\n\nWhen calculating a correlation you typically line up the data day by day (let\u2019s called this \u201cmatched data\u201d). For example, if one data set sits in the range A2:A200 and the other data set sits in range B2:B200 then the formula would be\n\n=CORREL(A2:A200,B2:B200).\n\nBut if you want to see if one variable leads the other, then change the ranges in the CORREL function so that one data set leads the other by one period or more. Try different lead times. For example, to see if the dataset in column A leads the dataset in column B by 1 day, the formula would be =CORREL(A2:A199,B3:B200).\n\nIf this returns a higher correlation value than the matched data correlation then the relationship is getting stronger. Finding leading indicators with strong correlations is hard but don't let that stop you trying.  If you find the secret sauce money glitch, let me know before you post.....\n\n**Are you still reading these headings?**\n\nOk - go forth and multiply your efforts with CORREL and DO NOT make posts with two shitty graphs saying \"Correlated\".  You have been warned.  No CORREL = no tendies. \n\n**TLDR** in case dipshits missed the one at the top of the page: use CORREL and show us the R value.\n\n**Outtro**\n\nObligatory rockets \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83c\udf46 \ud83d\udca6 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83c\udf46 \ud83d\udca6 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80",

Piss off with that. There is no control over the scales or time spans used and it is possible the graphs have been manipulated to present the desired conclusion. At times I think the \u201ceye-balling\u201d was done by a cross-eyed ass-clown jacked to the moobs on crack while spanking the monkey to re-runs of Laverne &amp; Shirley. The sort of guy who beats the bishop in his own Dutch oven. Yeah you just took advice from a guy with an IQ lower than that of a gooseberry.\n\nIn case you are curious the IQ is 2.81 according to jet punk (no link allowed)\n\n**What is a correlation?**\n\n[Correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation) measures the degree to which two things move relative to each other. It is a **statistical function** that measures a linear relationship; it is not eye-balled by some crack-taking, Jim Cramer-loving, 1970s sitcom-whacking, glass bottom-wearing savant who failed to get the McMascot job in Buttplug, Idaho.\n\nA correlation value (aka correlation coefficient or R value) is between -1 and +1 inclusive, but is sometimes expressed as a percentage (i.e. -100% &lt;= R &lt;= +100%).\n\n**So what?**\n\nA correlation of +1 means the two things are in lock step, i.e. perfectly correlated. As one moves up, so does the other and vice versa. Think of it like this: between the ages of 1 and 15, as you get older your shoe size also increases, unless your name is Tom Cruise who stopped growing [at age 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lI9CVX4uFSI). This has a correlation of +1. This is like ITM call options: as the price of the underlying stock goes up, then the value of the call option also goes up\u2026.just like the number of tendies. \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\n\nA correlation of -1 means two things move in opposite directions. As one goes up, the other goes down and vice versa. An example: as the stock price increases, the value of the put option decreases. Less tendies.  A perfect negative correlation.\n\nA correlation of 0 means there is no relationship between two independent things.  Think of it like this: if I looked at the ape population for 2021, there would no relationship between daily crayon consumption and the girth of your wife\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s love truncheon. No correlation = random tendies today.\n\nThis is what the correlations look like on a graph: (no links to Imgur......grrrr)\n\n[do not read the caption](https://preview.redd.it/lcpo4ph5p2l71.jpg?width=682&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14c99f8eb6f7f5edc40ad81f78b0bad924f99b00)\n\n**Random Heading Placeholder**\n\nBut you won\u2019t often see perfect positive or negative correlations. You will see values like -0.420 (a relatively weak negative correlation) or +0.69 (a moderately strong positive correlation). The +0.69 value when multiplied by itself gives an R squared value of 0.476 or 47.6%. In this case one variable accounts for about half the movement in the other.\n\n**Limitations of correlation**\n\n* Correlations are based on historical data (such as closing prices or VWAP) and are not predictions of movements in the future.\n* A correlation measures the relative direction of movements, not the size of the movements.\n* Correlation does not imply causation.\n* Whilst it appears there might be a mathematical relationship you might have a [spurious correlation](https://tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations).  For example: from 2000 to 2009 in the USA there is a +0.947 correlation between annual per capita cheese consumption and the number of people who died by getting tangled in their bedsheets. No shit.....but there may have been some on the tangled bedsheets. (Imma let myself out....)\n* No tool should be used in isolation, other statistical tools are available but I can only focus on one thing at once.  Today it is correlations.\n\n**Rough guideline to R values**\n\n* Anything above +0.9 or below -0.9 is very strong,\n* between -0.9 and -0.7 and between +0.7 and +0.9 are strong,\n* other values above 0.5 are moderately strong,\n* anything below 0.5 is weak,\n* close to 0 (e.g. under 0.1) = no relationship.\n\n**How to calculate R**\n\nOpen Excel, paste in the daily data or whatever and then use the CORREL function to calculate the correlation.  If you aren\u2019t sure RTFM.\n\n**Can it be used as a predictor?**\n\nYes it can.\n\nWhen calculating a correlation you typically line up the data day by day (let\u2019s called this \u201cmatched data\u201d). For example, if one data set sits in the range A2:A200 and the other data set sits in range B2:B200 then the formula would be\n\n=CORREL(A2:A200,B2:B200).\n\nBut if you want to see if one variable leads the other, then change the ranges in the CORREL function so that one data set leads the other by one period or more. Try different lead times. For example, to see if the dataset in column A leads the dataset in column B by 1 day, the formula would be =CORREL(A2:A199,B3:B200).\n\nIf this returns a higher correlation value than the matched data correlation then the relationship is getting stronger. Finding leading indicators with strong correlations is hard but don't let that stop you trying.  If you find the secret sauce money glitch, let me know before you post.....\n\n**Are you still reading these?**\n\nOk - go forth and multiply your efforts with CORREL and DO NOT make posts with two shitty graphs saying \"Correlated\".  You have been warned.  No CORREL = no tendies.\n\n**TLDR** in case dipshits missed the one at the top of the page: use CORREL and show us the R value.\n\n**Outtro**\n\nObligatory rockets \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83c\udf46 \ud83d\udca6 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83c\udf46 \ud83d\udca6 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80",
