        "selftext": "Hey guys, I read into this company and I feel this is a great company to hold for a few short years to a really long term hold. They have more cash than debt and their products are future proof. They make lasers for industrial cutting and 3d sensors etc, and they are in the fiber optic networks and photonics tech business. Their levered free cash flow is 400m with 1.2b debt and  1.5b cash. The only drawback of them i see is that they aren't as diversified with clients as Texas instruments who doesn't have 1 client makeup more than 10% of their revenue, for instance iphone makes up something like 60% of its 3d sensor revenue. I cant remember how much Apple contributed to lumentums 3d sensors revenue but it was north of 60%.",
