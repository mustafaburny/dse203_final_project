Facebook\u2019s Metaverse might be one of the greatest investment opportunities in the 2020s. If you are following Facebook\u2019s Connect 2021 conference you will realize how much deep Facebook now Meta has invested in the platform. They own Oculus which is the first step towards VR/AR metaverse. The application of Metaverse based platforms is immense and beyond gaming and virtually every aspect of our lives. Here are some of the potential companies to benefit from:\n\n1. Unity Software: Virtually all applications will be developed either on Unity or Unreal Engine.\n\n2. Autodesk: They own 3D Max and Maya which again might be used to develop VR/AR applications. Plus they have various Building Information Modelling tools like Revit and Navisworks which might be useful in creating Metaverse beyond gaming.\n\n3. Matterport: 3D scanning \n\n4. Trimble: Again they have Sketchup and various 3D scanning tools\n\n5. Shopify and Amazon: They might be the first ones to create virtual stores.\n\n6. Microsoft: They own Minecraft and have developed \u2018Hololens\u2019\n\n7. Roblox: The platform already works with Oculus.\n\nLet me know if there are any other key players which I have missed.",

        "selftext": "**Introduction and what is the Metaverse?:**\n\nAs you all probably know by now the popular social media company formerly known as Facebook has changed its name to Meta. This has sparked discussions about the Metaverse and its future effect on society, and rightfully so. Although I have seen many posts online and especially on Reddit which don\u2019t quite seem to grasp what the Metaverse is and why it's the future, please note if you are one of these people don\u2019t worry - it\u2019s complicated for sure! This post will explain simply what the Metaverse is and why you should get on board now. I will do my best to explain but if you have any questions please feel free to ask in the comments and I will be sure to reply.\n\nThe Metaverse put simply is the combination of multiple elements of technology, but put more complexly is where virtual reality, blockchain and web3 meet.\n\nThe best way of explaining web3 is to first understand web1 and web2. Web1 is what many may consider the first stage of the internet, if you look at what the first iterations of the internet were, it was just code on a screen. It was complex to use and only really used for sharing scientific work. Web2 is what we now know as the internet. This includes Youtube, Reddit etc. The main downside of web2 is for the longest time other than a domain name you couldn\u2019t own anything online. You could make a video and post it on Youtube, even though you feel you own the video and control it, Youtube at any point can remove the video and even your channel. At any point in time everything online can be controlled by someone else. This is where web3 comes in. Web3 is the next evolution of the internet. Web3 may as well be called the decentralised internet. It allows users to freely use the internet run on blockchain, so anyone can participate without having your personal data involved or monetized.\n\nThis is a big reason crypto based items such as coins and NFT\u2019s have taken off as they are based on web3 technology. For the first time normal everyday people are able to own their own little part of the internet, and no one, including the government, can tell you what to do. It's the next step for total freedom online.\n\nThe Metaverse isn\u2019t a place, the Metaverse isn\u2019t something you can touch. A big mistake I see is people think that there is going to be some sort of invention or overnight change where suddenly the Metaverse is mainstream and that's our lives, no. It will be a gradual change which has already started and will continue to the point that our virtual life is worth more to us than our physical lives.\n\n**Why is the Metaverse the next big thing?:**\n\nI think the best place to start on why the Metaverse will be the next big thing will be to look back at previous technology. 99% of human attention used to be on our physical environment. TV\u2019s dropped that to 85%. Computers dropped that to 70%. Phones dropped that to 50%. It's clear that as technology advances it absorbs more and more of our time and energy. At some point something new will drop that to lower and lower numbers to the point where we are using technology 100% of the time, this may take decades but it's entirely possible. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be something mind-blowing but just imagine some type of augmented reality device which either connects to your brain or you see it through contact lenses, imagine it just helped with basic everyday things like arrows on a road so you don't have to distract yourself with a GPS, or walking into a McDonalds and being able to see the calories of each food item on the menu. These are just basic examples of what the first iteration of augmented reality can do.\n\nThe Metaverse will be the next big thing because **it will be everything.** Anything you could imagine will be in the Metaverse. It can range from anything from gaming to concerts to seeing family members from the other side of the world. There is no beginning, middle and end, it's just infinite code waiting to be filled.\n\n**Real life application and potential benefits:**\n\nOne of the potential benefits I want to start with isn\u2019t about what will be good inside the Metaverse but outside it. A comment I\u2019m seeing a lot online is people saying \u201cI want to work on fixing the real world, not create a fake one\u201d. But I think people are missing the point that this will make the real world better. Imagine the millions of cars we can get off the road and reduce pollution if people no longer had to drive to work and school, and instead would stay at home and work in the Metaverse. Of course this may vary depending on the industry but even if we could get 50% of cars off the road it would be a massive achievement.\n\nAs I write this more and more benefits keep popping in my head, I will just briefly write some ideas but it's really going to be endless. Surgeons can practice their work virtually. Architects can design and walk around buildings before construction. Home buyers can visit a home from their own home. People on lower incomes can travel the world from their living room. Schools can visit any museum. Entrepreneurs and businesses can save money on office space. Lovers of history can travel to any time desired (DINOSAURS!). The list really is endless, so I will stop there.\n\n**Potential negatives and why it won\u2019t matter:**\n\nAs with any new technology there are always downsides. When the microwave first came out people were terrified of it, same with TV, radio, social media and now the Metaverse. I will note that is a good thing. As a society we should always look to protect ourselves and do what's best.\n\nThe Metaverse won\u2019t be perfect. Even nowadays cyber bullying is a major issue and it may not be any better in the Metaverse. We will distance ourselves further from the real world. Spending less and less physical time with our friends and family and more virtual time with them. The thing is though, the negatives don\u2019t matter. Whether it's good or bad technology has always advanced on and those who don\u2019t get on board are left behind. Many said at the birth of the internet that it would be bad but it is undoubtedly the best thing to happen to humanity in the past century, and this will have the same effect. I greatly encourage those to at least have an open mind when it comes to the Metaverse, we are on the dawn of something great and those who capitalise on it will be rewarded.\n\n**How long until the Metaverse is ready and becomes mainstream?:**\n\nI think this is a very hard question. Actually, I think this is an impossible question. You could try and rephrase it to \u2018How long until the internet is ready and becomes mainstream?\u2019 At no point does anyone announce the internet is ready and at no point is it officially called mainstream. At some point it just became what it is.\n\nThe Metaverse creation will be gradual, it will most likely take a decade minimum but my guess is as good as yours. I think the point at which we accept as a society that the Metaverse is ready is when our digital selves are worth more than our physical selves. You even start to see it now. Kids care more about how they look on Fortnite than in real life. Teens care more about how many followers they have on Instagram than in real life. The world has and always will be  changing with technology.\n\n**What to buy and how to make profit:**\n\nI could list any number of companies which could make you great gains in the near future, including FB, MSFT, U, RBLX, AMZN, ADSK etc. and I would be completely wrong! \n\nEven though I and many others may know a lot about the Metaverse, the truth is we won\u2019t be able to predict even 1% of what the final product will be. If you asked a million people before the internet what the most popular websites would be you wouldn\u2019t get a single right answer. No one knows so anyone telling you what to buy don\u2019t actually have a clue. Yes you can make money in the short term but that\u2019s it. Remember the dot com bubble? Watch out for a Metaverse bubble.\n\n**Final thoughts:**\n\nMy thoughts are to tell people now to worry. This isn\u2019t some doomsday device, it\u2019s better to just see it as an extension of your phone. The truth is we are years off of anything serious and no one is going to be forced to use it. I also don\u2019t see any chance of it being stopped by the government as I see some people online say. Sugar and cigarettes are bad but they are legal too. I would recommend anyone to at least try and allocate a small percentage of their portfolio to one of the bigger stock names linked to the Metaverse.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, November 17, 2021**\n\nStocks mostly drifted lower to hover below record levels, as market participants further digested yesterday\u2019s US retail sales report and new corporate earning results from major retailers, which provide further data into consumer spending patterns amid supply-chain disruptions. \n\n**Here are some key numbers for today**\n\n* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): -0.25%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): +0.05%\n* Dow Jones (DIA): -0.58%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): -1.27%\n* Apple (AAPL): +1.75%\n* Target (TGT): -4.73%\n\nThe Department of Commerce released their monthly Retail Sales Report, which showed better than expected consumer spending trends as the holiday season, by far the busiest in the year, continues to play out. Here are the numbers\n\n* Retail Sales: 1.7% increase vs 1.4% expected\n* Core Retail Sales: +1.6%\n* Manufacturing Production: +1.2%\n\nThe solid report suggests that high inflation is not dampening consumer spending. Rising household wealth, thanks to a strong stock market, house prices, and rising wages appear to be cushioning consumers against the highest annual pace of inflation in roughly thirty years. \n\nSteven Wieting, Citigroup\u2019s Global Wealth Chief Investment Strategist said, \u201cThe markets generally are looking at it \\[the pace of inflation\\], benignly - they are not discounting some longer-term inflation of more than 2.5%. You can see this in the pricing out on the yield curve of Treasuries. You can see this in the composition of the market with growth stocks not really being beaten down by any concerns about some lurch higher, tightening of monetary policy. We think that story is largely correct \u2013 it\u2019s benign for markets. It doesn\u2019t mean we get to repeat the returns from the past year, however.\u201d\n\nToday, Target (TGT) and Lowe\u2019s (LOW), two major retailers in the US, both reported better than expected earnings. This comes on the heels of both Walmart (WMT) and Home Depot (HD) both reporting strong earnings results earlier in the week. Here are the numbers (second number were analyst expectation):\n\n**Target (TGT)**: \u201cWith a strong inventory position heading into the peak of the holiday season, our team and our business are ready to serve our guests and poised to deliver continued, strong growth, through the holiday season and beyond,\" said Target Chairman and CEO Brian Cornell in a statement. \n\n* Revenue: $25.7 billion vs. $24.20 billion\n* Comparable Store Sales: +12.7% vs. +8.3%\n* Gross Margin: 28% vs. 29.80%\n* Operating Margin: 7.8% vs. 7.68%\n* Diluted EPS: $3.03 vs. $2.84\n\n**Lowe\u2019s (LOW):** \u201cOur momentum continued this quarter, with U.S. sales comps up nearly 34% on a two-year basis, as our Total Home strategy is resonating with the Pro and DIY customer alike. In the quarter, we drove over 16% growth in Pro and 25% on Lowes.com. We also delivered operating margin expansion by driving productivity through disciplined operational execution and cost management\u201d, said Lowe Chairman, President, and CEO Marvin Ellisoln. \n\n* Revenue: $22.92 billion vs. $22.06 billion \n* Earnings per share: $2.73 vs. $2.36\n* $1.90 billion in profits vs $692 million Q3 2020\n* Same Store Sales: +2.2% vs -1.5%\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The party seems over\u2026 after a blockbuster IPO, shares of EV startup Rivian (RIVN), which had a market cap of $150 billion on essentially 0 revenue, fell 15% today. In my humble opinion, I\u2019d get out if I had profits (not playing this at all). Shares of Lucid Motors (LCID) were also down roughly 5% in sympathy\n* CME Group (CME) the world's largest financial derivatives exchange in the world, trading everything from agricultural products, currencies, energy, interest rates, metals, stock indexes to digital currency futures, announced it was planning to move core trading systems Google Clouds, a massive move in financial markets. Until very recently, it was assumed that cloud computing was ill suited for high frequency trading, forcing these companies to build and develop complicated systems geared for time sensitive markets. If this works, it could reduce the cost of operations by a lot. \n* Fisker (FSR), another EV startup in the market, announced an electric SUV with higher driving range than Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) Model Y. Fisker announced the OCean Ultra SUV, which is planned to begin production next November, has a range of 340 miles and costs $50,000 compared to 300 miles and a cost of $60,000 with the Model Y\n* Apple said Wednesday that it has created a self-service repair program that would allow customers to repair their own devices using genuine Apple parts and tools. The iPhone and Mac maker said Self Service Repair would begin in early 2022 with a focus on the most common serviced modules, including phone display, battery and camera, with additional repair options to be added later in the year. The right to repair has been a big controversy surrounding technology sold by companies. \n* According to recent filings, Elon Musk is roughly halfway done with his pledge to sell 10% of his stake in Tesla (TSLA). You can see it here [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/insider-activity](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/insider-activity)\n* Waymo, which is a subsidiary of Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet, said on Wednesday it is expanding its partnership with United Parcel Service (UPS) to move freight using autonomous trucks between two of the parcel delivery company's Texas facilities during the holiday season. This comes amid a shortage of delivery drivers in the US. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current price target are written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Advance Auto Parts (AAP) with two target raises.

It is not more streamlined like Adobe after deeply rearchitecting for the cloud using Amazon and AWS. \n\n- Autodesk Forge is an API product that may see extensive use in markets like the metaverse, despite Autodesk Maya already being relevant in gaming or movies.\n\n- Autodesk Flex is a counter for piracy of expensive licenced or subscribed products. As I like to put it, piracy means there's a high demand for the product and a problem in its supply. It's a supply chain problem for software. \n\n- Autodesk Build is a spend management software which may be relevant as trillions of dollars continue to be injected into infrastructure markets.  \n\n- Fusion360 is a great introductory tool and funnel into the Autodesk ecosystem that ranges from water infrastructure to cinematic development.\n\n\n\nIMO Autodesk will he a 200B market cap company by 2024.",

The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, underperformed on the day, closing 0.44% lower.\n\nStronger than expected economic data coming out of China helped lift the sentiments of market participants following last week\u2019s inflation report. The world's second-largest economy saw both retail sales and industrial production unexpectedly rise in October in a year-over-year period, suggesting that China\u2019s economy is holding up better than expected amid new stay-in-place restrictions and ongoing power shortages.

The staying power and magnitude of inflationary pressures has, perhaps, become the central question for market participants, with companies across the board reporting rising input costs and price hikes passed on to the consumers to preserve margins.

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, November 17, 2021**\n\nStocks mostly drifted lower to hover below record levels, as market participants further digested yesterday\u2019s US retail sales report and new corporate earning results from major retailers, which provide further data into consumer spending patterns amid supply-chain disruptions. \n\n**Here are some key numbers for today**\n\n* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): -0.25%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): +0.05%\n* Dow Jones (DIA): -0.58%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): -1.27%\n* Apple (AAPL): +1.75%\n* Target (TGT): -4.73%\n\nThe Department of Commerce released their monthly Retail Sales Report, which showed better than expected consumer spending trends as the holiday season, by far the busiest in the year, continues to play out. Here are the numbers\n\n* Retail Sales: 1.7% increase vs 1.4% expected\n* Core Retail Sales: +1.6%\n* Manufacturing Production: +1.2%\n\nThe solid report suggests that high inflation is not dampening consumer spending. Rising household wealth, thanks to a strong stock market, house prices, and rising wages appear to be cushioning consumers against the highest annual pace of inflation in roughly thirty years. \n\nSteven Wieting, Citigroup\u2019s Global Wealth Chief Investment Strategist said, \u201cThe markets generally are looking at it \\[the pace of inflation\\], benignly - they are not discounting some longer-term inflation of more than 2.5%. You can see this in the pricing out on the yield curve of Treasuries. You can see this in the composition of the market with growth stocks not really being beaten down by any concerns about some lurch higher, tightening of monetary policy. We think that story is largely correct \u2013 it\u2019s benign for markets. It doesn\u2019t mean we get to repeat the returns from the past year, however.\u201d\n\nToday, Target (TGT) and Lowe\u2019s (LOW), two major retailers in the US, both reported better than expected earnings. This comes on the heels of both Walmart (WMT) and Home Depot (HD) both reporting strong earnings results earlier in the week. Here are the numbers (second number were analyst expectation):\n\n**Target (TGT)**: \u201cWith a strong inventory position heading into the peak of the holiday season, our team and our business are ready to serve our guests and poised to deliver continued, strong growth, through the holiday season and beyond,\" said Target Chairman and CEO Brian Cornell in a statement. \n\n* Revenue: $25.7 billion vs. $24.20 billion\n* Comparable Store Sales: +12.7% vs. +8.3%\n* Gross Margin: 28% vs. 29.80%\n* Operating Margin: 7.8% vs. 7.68%\n* Diluted EPS: $3.03 vs. $2.84\n\n**Lowe\u2019s (LOW):** \u201cOur momentum continued this quarter, with U.S. sales comps up nearly 34% on a two-year basis, as our Total Home strategy is resonating with the Pro and DIY customer alike. In the quarter, we drove over 16% growth in Pro and 25% on Lowes.com. We also delivered operating margin expansion by driving productivity through disciplined operational execution and cost management\u201d, said Lowe Chairman, President, and CEO Marvin Ellisoln. \n\n* Revenue: $22.92 billion vs. $22.06 billion \n* Earnings per share: $2.73 vs. $2.36\n* $1.90 billion in profits vs $692 million Q3 2020\n* Same Store Sales: +2.2% vs -1.5%\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The party seems over\u2026 after a blockbuster IPO, shares of EV startup Rivian (RIVN), which had a market cap of $150 billion on essentially 0 revenue, fell 15% today. In my humble opinion, I\u2019d get out if I had profits (not playing this at all). Shares of Lucid Motors (LCID) were also down roughly 5% in sympathy\n* CME Group (CME) the world's largest financial derivatives exchange in the world, trading everything from agricultural products, currencies, energy, interest rates, metals, stock indexes to digital currency futures, announced it was planning to move core trading systems Google Clouds, a massive move in financial markets. Until very recently, it was assumed that cloud computing was ill suited for high frequency trading, forcing these companies to build and develop complicated systems geared for time sensitive markets. If this works, it could reduce the cost of operations by a lot. \n* Fisker (FSR), another EV startup in the market, announced an electric SUV with higher driving range than Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) Model Y. Fisker announced the OCean Ultra SUV, which is planned to begin production next November, has a range of 340 miles and costs $50,000 compared to 300 miles and a cost of $60,000 with the Model Y\n* Apple said Wednesday that it has created a self-service repair program that would allow customers to repair their own devices using genuine Apple parts and tools. The iPhone and Mac maker said Self Service Repair would begin in early 2022 with a focus on the most common serviced modules, including phone display, battery and camera, with additional repair options to be added later in the year. The right to repair has been a big controversy surrounding technology sold by companies. \n* According to recent filings, Elon Musk is roughly halfway done with his pledge to sell 10% of his stake in Tesla (TSLA). You can see it here [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/insider-activity](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/insider-activity)\n* Waymo, which is a subsidiary of Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet, said on Wednesday it is expanding its partnership with United Parcel Service (UPS) to move freight using autonomous trucks between two of the parcel delivery company's Texas facilities during the holiday season. This comes amid a shortage of delivery drivers in the US. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current price target are written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Advance Auto Parts (AAP) with two target raises.

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 22nd, 2021.\n\n# **Stocks may be entering an optimal period in the Thanksgiving holiday week - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/19/stocks-may-be-entering-an-optimal-period-in-the-thanksgiving-holiday-week.html)**\n*****\n&gt; If history is a guide, the market should do well in the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday week.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was slightly higher in the past week, buoyed by positive economic reports, particularly the unexpectedly strong 1.7% jump in October\u2019s retail sales. There are a number of economic reports in the week ahead. The most important release is Wednesday\u2019s personal consumption expenditures, which includes the inflation measure most watched by the Federal Reserve.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe last five trading days of November are traditionally positive, since 1950,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. \u201cThere\u2019s a two-thirds likelihood the market is up on the day before Thanksgiving and a 57% likelihood the day after Thanksgiving, and a 71% likelihood that it\u2019s up on Monday.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; This year that holiday rally could depend on whether Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell continues in his role after his term expires in February. Biden has also interviewed Fed Governor Lael Brainard, who is supported by progressive Democrats.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists expect market volatility around the appointment, particularly if it is Brainard. She is viewed as more dovish than Powell, meaning she may be slower to raise interest rates. Elevated levels of inflation have been a concern in the market, and the worry is Brainard would not be as aggressive fighting it with rate hikes if necessary.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBarring a change at the helm of the Fed, I think the market trajectory is going to continue to be higher, as we move toward 2022,\u201d said Jeff Schulze, investment strategist with ClearBridge Investments. \u201cGiven that Brainard is even more dovish than Powell, I think markets would recover very quickly... the markets are unsure whether the new Fed chairman could command consensus within the FOMC to effectively deliver policy,\u201d he added.\n*****\n&gt; Schulze said the economic momentum is improving, and he expects that fourth-quarter gross domestic product could be in the double digits after the disappointing 2% pace of the third quarter. The second reading for the third-quarter GDP is released Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; In the past week, the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index also showed solid, better-than-expected activity in the mid-Atlantic region. \u201cIt really confirms the view that despite supply side constraints, the recovery is on track after the Covid-related slowdown in Q3,\u201d Schulze said. \u201cI think the markets are going to price in better earnings as we move into fourth-quarter earnings and 2022.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But Stovall said the market may take a pause before it moves higher, and he expects a choppy period. The S&amp;P 500 gains on average 7.2% between its October low and the end of the year. But by early November, the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 9% from its low, and was overbought, he said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall also said the market could become concerned again about the spread of Covid in Europe and beyond. Due to a high rate of new cases, the government of Austria announced a three-week lockdown and a vaccine mandate.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks reacted negatively to the Austrian news Friday, though the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained. Stocks were mixed for the week, with the Dow down 1.4% and the Nasdaq up 1.2%, lifted by tech stock gains. The S&amp;P 500 was up 0.3% for the week, ending at 4,697.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere is still upside potential. The worry about inflation and now Covid are reasons for the overbought condition to work itself through,\u201d he said. Stovall added the market could move sideways to lower for awhile, but it should end the year higher. \u201cBut right now, there\u2019s a bit of choppiness because of Covid, because of the Fed chair possibly being replaced the worry about inflation and now and a whole variety of things,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; For investors who watch the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, Wells Fargo bond strategists point out that long-term Treasury yields generally move lower on the Monday and Tuesday before Thanksgiving.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOur take is straightforward, and is essentially the same rationale as for moves around Labor Day: risk appetite is low on both the buy and sell sides,\u201d they said. But later in the week, starting Wednesday, the yield tends to rise.\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/kNp1r79.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/OuJmLXk.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7ZHgmF6.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DfpLdoE.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/b1mYk7A.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Hoh6b9B.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/b00QVfR.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vpWxpUa.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2npJmrq.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/C1h5qy6.jpg))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nhYuSri.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/PtJlpWL.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/EZIiLll.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/zkWnFL7.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/2Gqjuuj.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/ptj8wLh.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Tech is Leading Again\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Information Technology Sector has gained 27% in the past six months, outperforming the broader S&amp;P 500 by more than 10%. But could its run of leadership just be getting started? As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the sector just broke out to fresh relative highs for the first time since September 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chart-11.18.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 14 months without a new relative high may not sound like a lot, but that actually represented the longest streak of underperformance for the tech sector since a more than 3-year run that ended in 2015. And while the sector\u2019s breakout does not mean that it will automatically go on another run of multiyear outperformance, we do believe context is important and that investors should recognize that just because technology has had a strong run recently, over the past 14 months the sector has performed just in line with the broader market. We would also note that these are not all-time relative highs for the sector, as it still sits below its early-2000 peak.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe theme of 2021 has been rotation, rotation, rotation,\u201d said LPL Financial Technical Strategist Scott Brown. \u201cBut technology is the only sector to recently hit a 52-week relative high and we believe that sets up a favorable outlook heading into 2022.\u201d\n\n&gt; From a fundamental perspective, technology continues to be a key enabler of higher productivity and home to many of the fastest growing companies. Despite topping all sectors with 9% earnings growth in 2020, earnings growth this year is on track to exceed 30%.\n\n&gt; So does this mean investors should be shifting all of their assets over to growth stocks again? We don\u2019t necessarily think so, and continue to find opportunities in both growth and value styles. In our proprietary sector trend rankings, technology comes in at #2, trailing only energy and just ahead of financials, both of which sit firmly in the value style and have benefitted from the continued reopening and above trend economic growth. We believe quality growth and more cyclical value companies can both do well in the current environment and remain most negative on defensive sectors such as consumer staples and utilities that have traditionally underperformed during early-to-middle stages of the business cycle.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sentiment Back to Average\n\n&gt; The past week has seen the S&amp;P 500 hover right below but not at record highs. The lack of new highs in price appears to have left individual investors apprehensive as bullish sentiment in the AAII survey pulled back 9.2 percentage points to 38.8%. That was the biggest one-week drop since a 16.5 percentage point decline in the week of September 16th, though back then, bullish sentiment sat much lower at 22.4%. At the current level, bullish sentiment is still within one percentage point of the historical average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111821-AAII-Bull.png))**\n\n\n\n&gt; While bullish sentiment saw a sharp reversal lower, bearish sentiment rose modestly to 27.2%. That is the highest level since the end of October and that remains roughly 3 percentage points below the historical average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111821-AAII-Bear.png))**\n\n&gt; Those inverse moves resulted in the bull-bear spread falling to 11.6. While lower, that still indicates overall sentiment favors optimists.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111821-AAII-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; A greater share of the losses to bullish sentiment shifted to the neutral camp with around a third of respondents reporting as such. That is the highest level since the first week of October. That reading is a few percentage points above the historical average meaning that like bullish and bearish sentiment, current survey readings do not indicate sentiment is elevated or depressed to any sort of notable extent.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111821-AAII-Neutral.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2021 Now Has The Second Most New Highs Ever\n\n&gt; The incredible bull run of 2021 continues, with the S&amp;P 500 Index only 0.02% away from the 66th all-time high this calendar year, tied with (for now) the 65 set in 1964 and behind only the record 77 set in 1995. \u201cWe\u2019ve run out of superlatives to describe what we\u2019ve seen so far this year, so we\u2019ll keep it very simple. Years like this don\u2019t happen very often, so let\u2019s remember to enjoy it,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, 66 new highs this year would be second only to 1995. With about six weeks to go this year, 2021 is on pace to just barely miss setting a new record of new highs, but they say you won\u2019t hit the pitches you don\u2019t swing at and 2021 still has a lot of swings left, so anything is possible.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11.17.21-Blog-Chart1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; As we noted at the start of the month, November has been the best month of the year for stocks and it has been quite strong yet again this year. But be aware that November is historically rather strong early and late, while the middle can be choppy. Suggesting new highs could be a little tough to come by in the near-term, at least until we all get our fill of Turkey next week.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11.17.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Additionally, post-election years can get quite choppy from now until late in December. After the run we\u2019ve had lately, maybe some sideways chop is necessary, but we see further gains ahead through year-end.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11.17.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small and Mid Caps Gain Ground\n\n&gt; Equities broadly have been in rally mode so far this quarter, but in the month of November smaller market caps have generally outperformed. Month to date, the small-cap S&amp;P 600 ETF (IJR) has gained 5.88% as of this morning while the mid-cap S&amp;P 400 ETF (IJH) has risen 4.21%. Large caps as proxied by the S&amp;P 500 (SPY), meanwhile, are up less than 2% MTD. While there is plenty of time left in the month for things to change, the spread between the month-to-date performance of small and mid-caps versus large caps is on pace to be on the wider side of all months of the past twenty years. As shown in the charts below, IJR is currently outperforming SPY MTD by 4.05 percentage points, and that reading is 2.37 percentage points for IJH versus SPY. Those rank in the 91st and 86th percentiles, respectively, of all months of the past twenty years. That also marks the first month with significant outperformance of smaller market caps relative to large caps since the stretch of large-cap underperformance that ran from the fall of last year through this past February.

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 22nd, 2021.\n\n# **Stocks may be entering an optimal period in the Thanksgiving holiday week - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/19/stocks-may-be-entering-an-optimal-period-in-the-thanksgiving-holiday-week.html)**\n*****\n&gt; If history is a guide, the market should do well in the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday week.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was slightly higher in the past week, buoyed by positive economic reports, particularly the unexpectedly strong 1.7% jump in October\u2019s retail sales. There are a number of economic reports in the week ahead. The most important release is Wednesday\u2019s personal consumption expenditures, which includes the inflation measure most watched by the Federal Reserve.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe last five trading days of November are traditionally positive, since 1950,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. \u201cThere\u2019s a two-thirds likelihood the market is up on the day before Thanksgiving and a 57% likelihood the day after Thanksgiving, and a 71% likelihood that it\u2019s up on Monday.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; This year that holiday rally could depend on whether Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell continues in his role after his term expires in February. Biden has also interviewed Fed Governor Lael Brainard, who is supported by progressive Democrats.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists expect market volatility around the appointment, particularly if it is Brainard. She is viewed as more dovish than Powell, meaning she may be slower to raise interest rates. Elevated levels of inflation have been a concern in the market, and the worry is Brainard would not be as aggressive fighting it with rate hikes if necessary.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBarring a change at the helm of the Fed, I think the market trajectory is going to continue to be higher, as we move toward 2022,\u201d said Jeff Schulze, investment strategist with ClearBridge Investments. \u201cGiven that Brainard is even more dovish than Powell, I think markets would recover very quickly... the markets are unsure whether the new Fed chairman could command consensus within the FOMC to effectively deliver policy,\u201d he added.\n*****\n&gt; Schulze said the economic momentum is improving, and he expects that fourth-quarter gross domestic product could be in the double digits after the disappointing 2% pace of the third quarter. The second reading for the third-quarter GDP is released Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; In the past week, the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index also showed solid, better-than-expected activity in the mid-Atlantic region. \u201cIt really confirms the view that despite supply side constraints, the recovery is on track after the Covid-related slowdown in Q3,\u201d Schulze said. \u201cI think the markets are going to price in better earnings as we move into fourth-quarter earnings and 2022.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But Stovall said the market may take a pause before it moves higher, and he expects a choppy period. The S&amp;P 500 gains on average 7.2% between its October low and the end of the year. But by early November, the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 9% from its low, and was overbought, he said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall also said the market could become concerned again about the spread of Covid in Europe and beyond. Due to a high rate of new cases, the government of Austria announced a three-week lockdown and a vaccine mandate.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks reacted negatively to the Austrian news Friday, though the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained. Stocks were mixed for the week, with the Dow down 1.4% and the Nasdaq up 1.2%, lifted by tech stock gains. The S&amp;P 500 was up 0.3% for the week, ending at 4,697.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere is still upside potential. The worry about inflation and now Covid are reasons for the overbought condition to work itself through,\u201d he said. Stovall added the market could move sideways to lower for awhile, but it should end the year higher. \u201cBut right now, there\u2019s a bit of choppiness because of Covid, because of the Fed chair possibly being replaced the worry about inflation and now and a whole variety of things,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; For investors who watch the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, Wells Fargo bond strategists point out that long-term Treasury yields generally move lower on the Monday and Tuesday before Thanksgiving.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOur take is straightforward, and is essentially the same rationale as for moves around Labor Day: risk appetite is low on both the buy and sell sides,\u201d they said. But later in the week, starting Wednesday, the yield tends to rise.\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/kNp1r79.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/OuJmLXk.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7ZHgmF6.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DfpLdoE.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/b1mYk7A.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Hoh6b9B.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/b00QVfR.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vpWxpUa.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2npJmrq.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/C1h5qy6.jpg))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nhYuSri.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/PtJlpWL.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/EZIiLll.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/zkWnFL7.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/2Gqjuuj.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/ptj8wLh.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Tech is Leading Again\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Information Technology Sector has gained 27% in the past six months, outperforming the broader S&amp;P 500 by more than 10%. But could its run of leadership just be getting started? As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the sector just broke out to fresh relative highs for the first time since September 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chart-11.18.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 14 months without a new relative high may not sound like a lot, but that actually represented the longest streak of underperformance for the tech sector since a more than 3-year run that ended in 2015. And while the sector\u2019s breakout does not mean that it will automatically go on another run of multiyear outperformance, we do believe context is important and that investors should recognize that just because technology has had a strong run recently, over the past 14 months the sector has performed just in line with the broader market. We would also note that these are not all-time relative highs for the sector, as it still sits below its early-2000 peak.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe theme of 2021 has been rotation, rotation, rotation,\u201d said LPL Financial Technical Strategist Scott Brown. \u201cBut technology is the only sector to recently hit a 52-week relative high and we believe that sets up a favorable outlook heading into 2022.\u201d\n\n&gt; From a fundamental perspective, technology continues to be a key enabler of higher productivity and home to many of the fastest growing companies. Despite topping all sectors with 9% earnings growth in 2020, earnings growth this year is on track to exceed 30%.\n\n&gt; So does this mean investors should be shifting all of their assets over to growth stocks again? We don\u2019t necessarily think so, and continue to find opportunities in both growth and value styles. In our proprietary sector trend rankings, technology comes in at #2, trailing only energy and just ahead of financials, both of which sit firmly in the value style and have benefitted from the continued reopening and above trend economic growth. We believe quality growth and more cyclical value companies can both do well in the current environment and remain most negative on defensive sectors such as consumer staples and utilities that have traditionally underperformed during early-to-middle stages of the business cycle.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sentiment Back to Average\n\n&gt; The past week has seen the S&amp;P 500 hover right below but not at record highs. The lack of new highs in price appears to have left individual investors apprehensive as bullish sentiment in the AAII survey pulled back 9.2 percentage points to 38.8%. That was the biggest one-week drop since a 16.5 percentage point decline in the week of September 16th, though back then, bullish sentiment sat much lower at 22.4%. At the current level, bullish sentiment is still within one percentage point of the historical average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111821-AAII-Bull.png))**\n\n\n\n&gt; While bullish sentiment saw a sharp reversal lower, bearish sentiment rose modestly to 27.2%. That is the highest level since the end of October and that remains roughly 3 percentage points below the historical average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111821-AAII-Bear.png))**\n\n&gt; Those inverse moves resulted in the bull-bear spread falling to 11.6. While lower, that still indicates overall sentiment favors optimists.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111821-AAII-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; A greater share of the losses to bullish sentiment shifted to the neutral camp with around a third of respondents reporting as such. That is the highest level since the first week of October. That reading is a few percentage points above the historical average meaning that like bullish and bearish sentiment, current survey readings do not indicate sentiment is elevated or depressed to any sort of notable extent.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111821-AAII-Neutral.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2021 Now Has The Second Most New Highs Ever\n\n&gt; The incredible bull run of 2021 continues, with the S&amp;P 500 Index only 0.02% away from the 66th all-time high this calendar year, tied with (for now) the 65 set in 1964 and behind only the record 77 set in 1995. \u201cWe\u2019ve run out of superlatives to describe what we\u2019ve seen so far this year, so we\u2019ll keep it very simple. Years like this don\u2019t happen very often, so let\u2019s remember to enjoy it,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, 66 new highs this year would be second only to 1995. With about six weeks to go this year, 2021 is on pace to just barely miss setting a new record of new highs, but they say you won\u2019t hit the pitches you don\u2019t swing at and 2021 still has a lot of swings left, so anything is possible.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11.17.21-Blog-Chart1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; As we noted at the start of the month, November has been the best month of the year for stocks and it has been quite strong yet again this year. But be aware that November is historically rather strong early and late, while the middle can be choppy. Suggesting new highs could be a little tough to come by in the near-term, at least until we all get our fill of Turkey next week.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11.17.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Additionally, post-election years can get quite choppy from now until late in December. After the run we\u2019ve had lately, maybe some sideways chop is necessary, but we see further gains ahead through year-end.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11.17.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small and Mid Caps Gain Ground\n\n&gt; Equities broadly have been in rally mode so far this quarter, but in the month of November smaller market caps have generally outperformed. Month to date, the small-cap S&amp;P 600 ETF (IJR) has gained 5.88% as of this morning while the mid-cap S&amp;P 400 ETF (IJH) has risen 4.21%. Large caps as proxied by the S&amp;P 500 (SPY), meanwhile, are up less than 2% MTD. While there is plenty of time left in the month for things to change, the spread between the month-to-date performance of small and mid-caps versus large caps is on pace to be on the wider side of all months of the past twenty years. As shown in the charts below, IJR is currently outperforming SPY MTD by 4.05 percentage points, and that reading is 2.37 percentage points for IJH versus SPY. Those rank in the 91st and 86th percentiles, respectively, of all months of the past twenty years. That also marks the first month with significant outperformance of smaller market caps relative to large caps since the stretch of large-cap underperformance that ran from the fall of last year through this past February. Prior to that, you would have to go back to March 2018 to find the last time that small and mid-caps both outperformed large caps by as much as they are this month.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111521-Small-Large-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending November 19th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg_M8Nft2DE))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.21.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * (**$NIU $CRNC $ZH $ZM $URBN $A $KEYS $AFYA $IBEX $ELYS $BBY $DKS $AEO $XPEV $ANF $CBRL $DLTR $OGI $BURL $GPS $JWN $DELL $HPQ $ADSK $PLAN $DADA $VMW $NTNX $FUTU $DE $PDD $JFIN $ELLO**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/C1h5qy6.jpg))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/FJiwStD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/n79Wrb7.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.22.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/aNWXW4J.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.22.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WfbaPVY.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  11.23.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1ByRowi.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 11.23.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JhGm5Eq.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.24.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/CiaKSRL.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.24.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/CtirGik.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.25.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.

Autodesk's Role\n\n[Engaging with Industry 4.0](https://preview.redd.it/kz4g5qfd3zq61.png?width=3840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e45fab6fc951bf329cd89d8beccad8fe7504bb89)\n\n# TL;DR\n\nMeaningful, sustainable, long-term employment.\n\nThe current administration and Federal Reserve are continuing to progress in setting the stage for long-term investments in the American economy. In combination with the USMCA trade deal of 2020, the US will see 250B in investments per year for 8 years in infrastructure spending. We take a look at how Autodesk is a core benefactor of the economic models that govern these investments. I expect Autodesk to triple in size by 2024.\n\n[Autodesk Revenues](https://preview.redd.it/aj4qbyf05zq61.png?width=1276&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfff18884011a16bded7ba20d46e3772fad4a6fe)\n\n# Purpose\n\nTo be frank, I was surprised by the hunger for knowledge and I really enjoyed debating some of the rather brazen people here. WSB has grown and in my view, our committed analysts tend to run head-to-head with Wall Street analysts. We have on-the-ground experience as laborers, customers, and digital-natives that they often filter out of a privileged ignorance.\n\nPart of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation.\n\n\\- Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even rob-the-hood? **(Square DD Complete)**\n\n\\- How do we compare social media incentives? **(Pinterest DD Complete)**\n\n\\- What really is customer service? **(GameStop DD Complete)**\n\n\\- Are we familiar with new international trades that increase Mexican-Texan manufacturing? **(Kansas City Southern Rail DD Complete)**\n\n**-** What are elements behind US lagging industrial sector? **(You are here)**\n\n\\- Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio? *(Cloud Compute DD in Progress)*\n\n\\- Do we understand the consequences of STEAM education (Science, technology, engineering, arts, mathematics)? *(Roblox DD in Progress)*\n\n\\- How knowledgable are we of fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?\n\nAt the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m sharing my writing. I\u2019m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.\n\n# The Employment Problem\n\n&gt;The **Fourth Industrial Revolution** (or **Industry 4.0**) is the ongoing automation of traditional manufacturing and industrial practices, using modern smart technology. Large-scale machine-to-machine communication (M2M) and the internet of things (IoT) are integrated for increased automation, improved communication and self-monitoring, and production of smart machines that can analyze and diagnose issues without the need for human intervention.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A Skill Gap Problem](https://preview.redd.it/sbi6dmoy6zq61.png?width=711&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1cad0f9dc367ce723290f7ae65f97f702812041d)\n\nUltimately, the US is doing a pretty good job at maintaining  its engineering and architecture sectors, but there has been a glaring issue with a skill-gap that effects certain regions more than others. This is largely due to the strained relationship between increase automation vs. difficulty of learning the new tools associated with automation. People get left behind, especially when employment is lost in one factory and a worker is left to join another manufacturer with different standards, machines, or tools. In a nutshell, the barrier to entry for sustainable employment in the industrial sector has gone up in almost every facet.\n\nTools like Autodesk sit at the heart of these kinds of problems, where being able to understand and utilize a tool like Autodesk will dramatically increase your ability to get hired. In the information age, skills associated with Autodesk are ultimately as valuable as learning how to code in software or knowing the value of legislation and finance in other white-collar sectors. Autodesk lags behind these competitive sectors because the nature of industry it exists in with high capital expenditures.\n\nThe problem is a bottleneck problem, and solving the bottleneck will produce a far leaner and more efficient pipeline for industrial productivity, employment, and societal satisfaction.\n\n[Autodesk's recognition of its role, alongside organizations like Adobe.](https://preview.redd.it/kvm8z2md8zq61.png?width=1588&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6d865498e39ddeff11d800b4e8e904d6137539c)\n\n# The Education Solution\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ly24pppuezq61.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ab25ce2945104acb0f3c4d3816cb713db1af238\n\nThe reality here is that the education sector is also a slow-mover where shortcuts carry heavy competitive consequences. Another big element in this process is that high-level skills are ultimately dependent on adoption and communication demands. We need adaptable engineers to be familiar with a fundamental skill set that speak similar \"languages\". Autodesk has generally positioned itself to be one of those tools in a similar way that organizations like Adobe has positioned itself.\n\nWhat I believe will happen is that the incentive of certifications and accelerated programs will increase dramatically as a way to boost lucrative employment and adoption of skills. These training programs will effectively become tickets initiate a good career.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mj3rk4a2gzq61.png?width=2528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bde08f5487ed3afdd3a760fc1b3d7a019eb89ca6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xib18z21hzq61.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bb74a3b31dda0b750b0cb19fdfc4f97a2a4515b\n\n# AutoDesk's Role\n\nAutoDesk targets the EAC sector (engineering, architecture, and construction), so it helps to think about AutoDesk as software that can handle large scale developments focusing on the nature of smaller designs like intricate screws or cars. There is a lot of work that must be completed, with a strong societal demand. This can range from multi-year developments of hospital building in rural areas, or the construction of off-shore windmill farms. This inevitably creates a powerful compounding effect with employment and Autodesk's subscription model and increasing mobile capacities.\n\n\\- As employment increases, subscriptions begin to increase.\n\n\\- As subscription increases, projects of scale are adopted.\n\n\\- As projects of scale increase, employment increases.\n\n\\- As employment increases, the length of subscription increases.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vk4hin3cozq61.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b569a74582ac2699904727002ae3663f530a95c7\n\nThe following is a list of Autodesk's relationship with various opportunities in the near and longterm.\n\n\\- **LEED architecture certification in civil sectors with Autodesk's architecture platform, Revit.**\n\n&gt;**Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design** (**LEED**) is a green building certification program used worldwide. Developed by the non-profit U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) it includes a set of rating systems for the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of green buildings, homes, and neighborhoods which aims to help building owners and operators be environmentally responsible and use resources efficiently.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ee4tjnc7lzq61.png?width=740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc84dacfe3b87538cc1c390b3122001ee54d911a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/343gkyy4lzq61.png?width=2518&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e85ead7fa9f1d7dbabf9550db845312a6bf417b6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vv0kyc9plzq61.png?width=1606&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5895ef4b34a6d7979b441a65bedd24794ff7cba1\n\n\\- **Water maintenance system certifications with AutoDesk's end-to-end water system software, Innovyze**\n\n&gt;Innovyze is a global leader in building innovative, industry-leading software for the water industry for over 35 years; serving thousands of clients including the largest utilities, construction design firms, consultancies and refining plants around the world.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/osvbe3xwlzq61.png?width=2540&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01171822c0c5d78e9957d1121cbc6df64c2994c8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/12v4ndv3mzq61.png?width=1602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e5127af358c0be7792cc83c71a4b58bc6715d84\n\n\\- Robotics certifications with Autodesk robotics software, Powermill\n\n&gt;Fusion 360 with PowerMill CAM software provides expert CNC programming strategies for complex 3- and 5-axis manufacturing (the functional space where robots can move around).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8pfyslzknzq61.png?width=2364&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9661fcf9fed560a4a1d1fb39021723a85c462742\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d2tg9g6pqzq61.png?width=1588&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6359ad43ec16be671ce0dd208932892399cf7745\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCover: [https://luna1.co/3edd28.jpg](https://luna1.co/3edd28.jpg)",

        "selftext": "**Introduction and what is the Metaverse?:**\n\nAs you all probably know by now the popular social media company formerly known as Facebook has changed its name to Meta. This has sparked discussions about the Metaverse and its future effect on society, and rightfully so. Although I have seen many posts online and especially on Reddit which don\u2019t quite seem to grasp what the Metaverse is and why it's the future, please note if you are one of these people don\u2019t worry - it\u2019s complicated for sure! This post will explain simply what the Metaverse is and why you should get on board now. I will do my best to explain but if you have any questions please feel free to ask in the comments and I will be sure to reply.\n\nThe Metaverse put simply is the combination of multiple elements of technology, but put more complexly is where virtual reality, blockchain and web3 meet.\n\nThe best way of explaining web3 is to first understand web1 and web2. Web1 is what many may consider the first stage of the internet, if you look at what the first iterations of the internet were, it was just code on a screen. It was complex to use and only really used for sharing scientific work. Web2 is what we now know as the internet. This includes Youtube, Reddit etc. The main downside of web2 is for the longest time other than a domain name you couldn\u2019t own anything online. You could make a video and post it on Youtube, even though you feel you own the video and control it, Youtube at any point can remove the video and even your channel. At any point in time everything online can be controlled by someone else. This is where web3 comes in. Web3 is the next evolution of the internet. Web3 may as well be called the decentralised internet. It allows users to freely use the internet run on blockchain, so anyone can participate without having your personal data involved or monetized.\n\nThis is a big reason cripto (spelt wrong on purpose as the correct word is not allowed) based items such as coins and NFT\u2019s have taken off as they are based on web3 technology. For the first time normal everyday people are able to own their own little part of the internet, and no one, including the government, can tell you what to do. It's the next step for total freedom online.\n\nThe Metaverse isn\u2019t a place, the Metaverse isn\u2019t something you can touch. A big mistake I see is people think that there is going to be some sort of invention or overnight change where suddenly the Metaverse is mainstream and that's our lives, no. It will be a gradual change which has already started and will continue to the point that our virtual life is worth more to us than our physical lives.\n\n**Why is the Metaverse the next big thing?:**\n\nI think the best place to start on why the Metaverse will be the next big thing will be to look back at previous technology. 99% of human attention used to be on our physical environment. TV\u2019s dropped that to 85%. Computers dropped that to 70%. Phones dropped that to 50%. It's clear that as technology advances it absorbs more and more of our time and energy. At some point something new will drop that to lower and lower numbers to the point where we are using technology 100% of the time, this may take decades but it's entirely possible. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be something mind-blowing but just imagine some type of augmented reality device which either connects to your brain or you see it through contact lenses, imagine it just helped with basic everyday things like arrows on a road so you don't have to distract yourself with a GPS, or walking into a McDonalds and being able to see the calories of each food item on the menu. These are just basic examples of what the first iteration of augmented reality can do.\n\nThe Metaverse will be the next big thing because **it will be everything.** Anything you could imagine will be in the Metaverse. It can range from anything from gaming to concerts to seeing family members from the other side of the world. There is no beginning, middle and end, it's just infinite code waiting to be filled.\n\n**Real life application and potential benefits:**\n\nOne of the potential benefits I want to start with isn\u2019t about what will be good inside the Metaverse but outside it. A comment I\u2019m seeing a lot online is people saying \u201cI want to work on fixing the real world, not create a fake one\u201d. But I think people are missing the point that this will make the real world better. Imagine the millions of cars we can get off the road and reduce pollution if people no longer had to drive to work and school, and instead would stay at home and work in the Metaverse. Of course this may vary depending on the industry but even if we could get 50% of cars off the road it would be a massive achievement.\n\nAs I write this more and more benefits keep popping in my head, I will just briefly write some ideas but it's really going to be endless. Surgeons can practice their work virtually. Architects can design and walk around buildings before construction. Home buyers can visit a home from their own home. People on lower incomes can travel the world from their living room. Schools can visit any museum. Entrepreneurs and businesses can save money on office space. Lovers of history can travel to any time desired (DINOSAURS!). The list really is endless, so I will stop there.\n\n**Potential negatives and why it won\u2019t matter:**\n\nAs with any new technology there are always downsides. When the microwave first came out people were terrified of it, same with TV, radio, social media and now the Metaverse. I will note that is a good thing. As a society we should always look to protect ourselves and do what's best.\n\nThe Metaverse won\u2019t be perfect. Even nowadays cyber bullying is a major issue and it may not be any better in the Metaverse. We will distance ourselves further from the real world. Spending less and less physical time with our friends and family and more virtual time with them. The thing is though, the negatives don\u2019t matter. Whether it's good or bad technology has always advanced on and those who don\u2019t get on board are left behind. Many said at the birth of the internet that it would be bad but it is undoubtedly the best thing to happen to humanity in the past century, and this will have the same effect. I greatly encourage those to at least have an open mind when it comes to the Metaverse, we are on the dawn of something great and those who capitalise on it will be rewarded.\n\n**How long until the Metaverse is ready and becomes mainstream?:**\n\nI think this is a very hard question. Actually, I think this is an impossible question. You could try and rephrase it to \u2018How long until the internet is ready and becomes mainstream?\u2019 At no point does anyone announce the internet is ready and at no point is it officially called mainstream. At some point it just became what it is.\n\nThe Metaverse creation will be gradual, it will most likely take a decade minimum but my guess is as good as yours. I think the point at which we accept as a society that the Metaverse is ready is when our digital selves are worth more than our physical selves. You even start to see it now.

If you asked a million people before the internet what the most popular websites would be you wouldn\u2019t get a single right answer. No one knows so anyone telling you what to buy don\u2019t actually have a clue. Yes you can make money in the short term but that\u2019s it. Remember the dot com bubble? Watch out for a Metaverse bubble.\n\n**Final thoughts:**\n\nMy thoughts are to tell people now to worry. This isn\u2019t some doomsday device, it\u2019s better to just see it as an extension of your phone. The truth is we are years off of anything serious and no one is going to be forced to use it. I also don\u2019t see any chance of it being stopped by the government as I see some people online say. Sugar and cigarettes are bad but they are legal too. I would recommend anyone to at least try and allocate a small percentage of their portfolio to one of the bigger stock names linked to the Metaverse.",

        "selftext": "**Introduction and what is the Metaverse?:**\n\nAs you all probably know by now the popular social media company formerly known as Facebook has changed its name to Meta. This has sparked discussions about the Metaverse and its future effect on society, and rightfully so. Although I have seen many posts online and especially on Reddit which don\u2019t quite seem to grasp what the Metaverse is and why it's the future, please note if you are one of these people don\u2019t worry - it\u2019s complicated for sure! This post will explain simply what the Metaverse is and why you should get on board now. I will do my best to explain but if you have any questions please feel free to ask in the comments and I will be sure to reply.\n\nThe Metaverse put simply is the combination of multiple elements of technology, but put more complexly is where virtual reality, blockchain and web3 meet.\n\nThe best way of explaining web3 is to first understand web1 and web2. Web1 is what many may consider the first stage of the internet, if you look at what the first iterations of the internet were, it was just code on a screen. It was complex to use and only really used for sharing scientific work. Web2 is what we now know as the internet. This includes Youtube, Reddit etc. The main downside of web2 is for the longest time other than a domain name you couldn\u2019t own anything online. You could make a video and post it on Youtube, even though you feel you own the video and control it, Youtube at any point can remove the video and even your channel. At any point in time everything online can be controlled by someone else. This is where web3 comes in. Web3 is the next evolution of the internet. Web3 may as well be called the decentralised internet. It allows users to freely use the internet run on blockchain, so anyone can participate without having your personal data involved or monetized.\n\nThe Metaverse isn\u2019t a place, the Metaverse isn\u2019t something you can touch. A big mistake I see is people think that there is going to be some sort of invention or overnight change where suddenly the Metaverse is mainstream and that's our lives, no. It will be a gradual change which has already started and will continue to the point that our virtual life is worth more to us than our physical lives.\n\n**Why is the Metaverse the next big thing?:**\n\nI think the best place to start on why the Metaverse will be the next big thing will be to look back at previous technology. 99% of human attention used to be on our physical environment. TV\u2019s dropped that to 85%. Computers dropped that to 70%. Phones dropped that to 50%. It's clear that as technology advances it absorbs more and more of our time and energy. At some point something new will drop that to lower and lower numbers to the point where we are using technology 100% of the time, this may take decades but it's entirely possible. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be something mind-blowing but just imagine some type of augmented reality device which either connects to your brain or you see it through contact lenses, imagine it just helped with basic everyday things like arrows on a road so you don't have to distract yourself with a GPS, or walking into a McDonalds and being able to see the calories of each food item on the menu. These are just basic examples of what the first iteration of augmented reality can do.\n\nThe Metaverse will be the next big thing because **it will be everything.** Anything you could imagine will be in the Metaverse. It can range from anything from gaming to concerts to seeing family members from the other side of the world. There is no beginning, middle and end, it's just infinite code waiting to be filled.\n\n**Real life application and potential benefits:**\n\nOne of the potential benefits I want to start with isn\u2019t about what will be good inside the Metaverse but outside it. A comment I\u2019m seeing a lot online is people saying \u201cI want to work on fixing the real world, not create a fake one\u201d. But I think people are missing the point that this will make the real world better. Imagine the millions of cars we can get off the road and reduce pollution if people no longer had to drive to work and school, and instead would stay at home and work in the Metaverse. Of course this may vary depending on the industry but even if we could get 50% of cars off the road it would be a massive achievement.\n\nAs I write this more and more benefits keep popping in my head, I will just briefly write some ideas but it's really going to be endless. Surgeons can practice their work virtually. Architects can design and walk around buildings before construction. Home buyers can visit a home from their own home. People on lower incomes can travel the world from their living room. Schools can visit any museum. Entrepreneurs and businesses can save money on office space. Lovers of history can travel to any time desired (DINOSAURS!). The list really is endless, so I will stop there.\n\n**Potential negatives and why it won\u2019t matter:**\n\nAs with any new technology there are always downsides. When the microwave first came out people were terrified of it, same with TV, radio, social media and now the Metaverse. I will note that is a good thing. As a society we should always look to protect ourselves and do what's best.\n\nThe Metaverse won\u2019t be perfect. Even nowadays cyber bullying is a major issue and it may not be any better in the Metaverse. We will distance ourselves further from the real world. Spending less and less physical time with our friends and family and more virtual time with them. The thing is though, the negatives don\u2019t matter. Whether it's good or bad technology has always advanced on and those who don\u2019t get on board are left behind. Many said at the birth of the internet that it would be bad but it is undoubtedly the best thing to happen to humanity in the past century, and this will have the same effect. I greatly encourage those to at least have an open mind when it comes to the Metaverse, we are on the dawn of something great and those who capitalise on it will be rewarded.\n\n**How long until the Metaverse is ready and becomes mainstream?:**\n\nI think this is a very hard question. Actually, I think this is an impossible question. You could try and rephrase it to \u2018How long until the internet is ready and becomes mainstream?\u2019 At no point does anyone announce the internet is ready and at no point is it officially called mainstream. At some point it just became what it is.\n\nThe Metaverse creation will be gradual, it will most likely take a decade minimum but my guess is as good as yours. I think the point at which we accept as a society that the Metaverse is ready is when our digital selves are worth more than our physical selves. You even start to see it now. Kids care more about how they look on Fortnite than in real life. Teens care more about how many followers they have on Instagram than in real life. The world has and always will be  changing with technology.\n\n**What to buy and how to make profit:**\n\nI could list any number of companies which could make you great gains in the near future, including FB, MSFT, U, RBLX, AMZN, ADSK etc. and I would be completely wrong! \n\nEven though I and many others may know a lot about the Metaverse, the truth is we won\u2019t be able to predict even 1% of what the final product will be. If you asked a million people before the internet what the most popular websites would be you wouldn\u2019t get a single right answer. No one knows so anyone telling you what to buy don\u2019t actually have a clue. Yes you can make money in the short term but that\u2019s it. Remember the dot-com bubble? Watch out for a Metaverse bubble.\n\n**Final thoughts:**\n\nMy thoughts are to tell people now to worry. This isn\u2019t some doomsday device, it\u2019s better to just see it as an extension of your phone. The truth is we are years off of anything serious and no one is going to be forced to use it. I also don\u2019t see any chance of it being stopped by the government as I see some people online say. Sugar and cigarettes are bad but they are legal too.
