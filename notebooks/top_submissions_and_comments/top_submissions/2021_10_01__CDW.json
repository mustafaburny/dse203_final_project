        "selftext": "# Altus\u2019 Business and Competitive Position \n\nAltus is a clean electrification company that develops, owns, and operates solar systems and energy storage for commercial customers, communities, and residential customers. Altus has been profitable for years, with 50-60% EBITDA margins, and expects to grow EBITDA by \\~77% annually through 2024.\n\n**Altus is led by highly capable, seasoned founders**:\n\n* Lars Norell (co-founder and co-CEO) was previously a Principal and Managing Director at Cohen &amp; Company where he served as Head of Capital Markets and subsequently led the Alternative Assets effort. Before joining Cohen &amp; Company, Norell was an MD and Co-Head of US Structured Credit Products at Merrill Lynch. \n* Greg Felton (co-founder and co-CEO) was a partner at Goldman Sachs and the Chief Investment Officer of the Credit Alternatives platform at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.\n\n**Altus is ahead of the pack and expanding its service offerings; capital from + partnership with CBRE should put it even further ahead**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3zg3h3pvw2r71.png?width=1420&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6e5189474922c2f4a25224c172c5b81d299cfce\n\n*Two of the largest players in commercial real estate are on Altus\u2019 side* \n\n* CBAH was formed by CBRE and Blackstone has been a long-time investor in Altus (its ownership is currently 17%). \n* Through Blackstone, Altus has access to the most efficient debt and tax equity financing within a fragmented industry where others do not. \n* CBRE is the world\u2019s largest commercial real estate services firm. CBRE manages 7 billion square feet of commercial real estate and $8 billion of energy spend annually.  \n   * (More detail on CBRE\u2019s ability to directly add value on p.3)\n* CBRE also currently possesses over 20 billion data points stored in its Enterprise Data Platform for the CRE assets it operates; CBRE plans to leverage its Data &amp; Analytic capabilities to create a new software tool capable of analyzing client portfolios to aid in identifying attractive opportunities for Altus Power and for clients.\n* CBRE and Blackstone give Altus a considerable edge over competitors.\n\n*Altus\u2019 customers are highly reliable*\n\n* Not a single payment default in its history of more than a decade\n\n*Multiple additional growth opportunities*\n\n* Altus is beginning to build out EV charging stations at office buildings, which are an ideal place to install EV chargers given that employee cars sit idle all day long. And unlike most charging stations, users can actually see that their electricity is coming directly from a clean source.\n* U.S. cumulative **installed battery storage** is anticipated to **grow at \\~49% annually** to 54 GWh2 by 2030.\n\n## The CBAH Transaction and Valuation\n\n**Interests between all stakeholders are aligned to an exceptional degree and CBRE is in a position to add substantial value**\n\n* Existing investors and management are not only rolling 100% but are also investing $25M in the PIPE.\n* CBRE is investing $75M in the PIPE and has provided a commitment to backstop up to $150M of SPAC redemptions at the same terms as the PIPE.\n* Moreover, CBAH agreed to the \u201cSAIL\u201d promote structure from the get-go, which means the entire promote (which is already capped at 15%) is earned over time as share price appreciates. \n   * The first sponsor shares are earned when shares reach $12.\n\n*\\* Notes regarding CBAH warrants: $11.00 strike price and \u00bc warrant coverage \\**\n\n**Altus is valued at an EBITDA multiple discount to** ***qualitatively*** **comparable (residential) solar companies, which have inferior financials and growth** \n\n[\\*as of 10\\/01](https://preview.redd.it/fsx37cetx2r71.png?width=2328&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=718bd491723d2aa7595c037b6f29160c3cf85a79)\n\n**Altus\u2019 projections are conservative and CBRE can meaningfully add value** \n\n* Their current 900+ MW pipeline represents a \\~2.0x coverage over the 445 MW required to achieve 2022 annualized EBITDA\n* Further, the projections do *not* include the potentially massive windfall from their partnership with CBRE.\n* Unlike the vast majority of SPAC sponsors, CBRE is not only highly incentivized to add value, they are actually in a position to do so in a direct and substantial way.\n\n**CBRE Direct Value Add**\n\n[Note: 2023 EV is conservative given that SPWR is currently valued at \\~28 x 2022 EBITDA.](https://preview.redd.it/033etx89y2r71.png?width=1244&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9d465df62327901b831ad144e7871e400dd036e)\n\n# Potential Risks and Concerns Identified and Addressed\n\n**Altus\u2019 employee count to market cap ratio is dramatically low than peers**\n\nAlthough the comps cited in the investor presentation appear to be *truly comparable* in terms of the quality of leadership, product offering, market position, scale, etc., Altus currently employs far fewer people than its peers (according to LinkedIn).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ux2htm2my2r71.png?width=944&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=901e6a9348875cc7822ceca069e0d710999d8ee6\n\nThis difference is eye-catching; and it\u2019s possibly indicative of a less robust and capable company. To the extent that meeting projections will require increased hiring efforts, both recruiting and integrating capable employees could prove to be a major hurdle. \n\nThere is reason to think this might *not* be cause for concern, though. This low ratio could very well be a result of Altus operating predominantly in the commercial, industrial, and community solar markets \u2013 where customer offtake is much larger and a far smaller salesforce is needed compared to the residential marketplace. Indeed, Altus cites a low customer acquisition cost as a positive differentiator between it and residential solar companies and its margins are significantly higher. (Altus is compared to residential solar companies since there are no public commercial solar companies.) Relatedly, Altus states in the presentation that they rely on contractors and third parties for both installation and sales sourcing. So Altus may employ a relatively high number of contract workers and/or manual workers who do not show up in online searches. \n\n**Public comps are volatile and are now considerably lower (\\~10-15%) than they were when the CBAH deal was announced**\n\nThere is risk of this downward trend extending to the date of the merger (Q4 2021). With that said, this is already factored into the valuation math on p.2, which demonstrates Altus\u2019 discount to comps relative to both 2022 and 2023 EBITDA. And volatility is a double-edged sword, especially with respect to the value of warrants, which should benefit from higher volatility (theoretically, at least). \n\n**Altus lacks a significant technological moat**\n\nAltus does not produce its panels, nor does it have sophisticated proprietary energy storage technology like Stem. Altus does, however, have some software technology IP and data. Here\u2019s what Norell said about this during the analyst day presentation:\n\n&gt;Two years ago \\[we built\\] our own monitoring software, which we named Gaia, and since that time we have also built asset registries and stored all the data coming out of our designs and systems and equipment choices and added the functionalities described on this page... what we were planning to do next is to scale Gaia in two directions... for asset servicing, predictive maintenance of our solar assets using machine learning and AI, and for origination of new customers and assets, develop a customer interface that we can use to originate both commercial and community solar customers. We\u2019ve started collaborating with CBRE on both of these initiatives.\n\nNevertheless, the ultimate benefit of this software and data is not all that clear. So it\u2019s reasonable to assign it little to no value at this point. However, where Altus may have an underappreciated moat is in financing and managing its projects. Unlike residential solar, which has standardized financing, each commercial solar project has a high degree of customization and complexity. Often the work and expense involved in acquiring a customer and securing financing makes deals with commercial customers unworkable. ([Forbes](https://www.google.com/search?q=untpped+comercial+and+industrial+solar&amp;oq=un&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59l2j0i67j35i39j69i60j69i61j69i60l2.839j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)) As mentioned on p.1, Altus is run by executives with deep expertise in structuring complex financial agreements. And Altus\u2019 partnership with Blackstone Credit increases this edge.  \n\nFurther, there are plenty of companies that have achieved significant growth and outperformance despite lacking a technological or consumer brand moat. The most relevant example that jumps to mind is Public Storage (PSA). In the past 20 years, PSA has doubled the S&amp;P 500\u2019s performance \u2013 outpacing the S&amp;P by \\~500%. ([WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/wall-streets-hidden-gem-is-in-public-storage-1455556303)) In the past 10 and 5 years, PSA has outperformed by \\~130% and 60% respectively. This shows the value creation of companies that have exceptional management and execution, especially when such companies are operating in an industry with strong secular growth. There is good reason to believe that Altus is such a company.\n\nDisclaimers: I'm not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice.\n\nDisclosure: I hold 110,000 CBAH warrants.",

        "selftext": "So the news has been consistent for some time now, well since the beginning of the pandemic really, that the supply chains will be interrupted.\n\nThe way I imagine it is similar to a traffic even where a disruption in flow will cause a chain react to the process of smooth traffic.\n\nSo we are here now. We saw the disruption ahead, and it is time that traffic, or supply chains, are slowing down as a result of this interruption.\n\n\nMy view is that business expense software will likely shine in the next year or two. So companies like Coupa Software and Autodesk will see a relative tailwind, while other systems like Oracle, SAP, and Salesforce will see a stress test.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the supply chain crunch?

        "selftext": "Basically i am very bullish on $KPLT at this price $4.85, here's why\n\n1) When u look at the number of buys from insider and institutional holders when this one crash in august due to removal of their guidance, they show smart money actually think the stock price around $3\\~5 is a steal.

The company provides B2B services for millions of SMB and enterprises around the world\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qn847nz0a5s71.png?width=1759&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d05be8973c4bfefe00396c250fb92fe123c5f0ae\n\nThe ideal customer is a small but growing SMB doing business all over the world which needs currency, compliance and business services. Payoneer is an obvious candidate to handles these needs given its global network.\n\n\u00b7 Payoneer offers vendors the ability to move money with a U.S. bank account and pay suppliers, without having to deal with too many banking hurdles or red tape.\n\n\u00b7 A lot of freelancers on Upwork.com use Payoneer because many of them live in countries that Upwork.com can't wire money to.\n\n\u00b7 Once vendors receive funds into their Payoneer account they can either withdraw the cash using their Payoneer provided Master Card or do a direct bank transfer from Payoneer to their local bank. Usually funds arrive within 1-2 business days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cjzym5w1a5s71.png?width=1764&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e77f88b654fe44aca54902b8a4f1d18bb7c519b9\n\nSo, it is basically a bank that includes an accountant to help meet a business\u2019 needs. The one product or feature that is missing is digital coins.\n\nSay a consumer wants to rent an airbnb. They use a credit card (or other payment method) to pay airbnb, a payment gateway facilitates payment acceptance. The payment is then processed and Airbnb ends up with the money from the transaction. Airbnb has now gathered cash through its acquirers (e.g., Adyen, ACI). Airbnb now needs to distribute funds to its SMB sellers. Airbnb uses payoneer to disburse funds to sellers. From this example, you can see Payoneer isn't competing with companies like Adyen or other acquirers/ processors, even though they are processing payments.\n\nPayoneer signs up individual sellers, which allows the sellers to use payoneer across platforms (e.g., facebook marketplace and amazon). Hyperwallet (owned by PayPal) is one of their competitors, but Hyperwallet operates completely differently, they sign up users via the platform, but this means you can't use hyperwallet for your business on both amazon and fb marketplace without going through the onboarding process again. Given the trend towards SMB sellers operating across multiple marketplaces, this is a huge benefit for payoneer, and makes PayPal's offering a lot less competitive. It also means Payoneer owns the seller relationship in a way that PayPal doesn't do as effectively, and makes it easier for them to package other offerings (e.g., working capital). These other offerings provide a two-fold benefit - their customer relationships become stronger, so revenue is seen as more recurring and investors will pay a higher multiple; and they'll make more money per customer.\n\nMy view is that Payoneer should see an S-type growth curve, where they'll hit a critical mass of users and see exponential growth, like cashapp, or venmo. Their investor presentation projects 25% revenue growth over the next couple years, I think this is super conservative, especially considering that 25% growth rate doesn't account for the two travel related marketplaces that got screwed by covid. Once they hit that critical mass of users, they'll pop off, sales &amp; marketing expenses will drop, and they'll become profitable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5xuonwi2a5s71.png?width=1556&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b57e5a829bbcb5d58f51cbdc2e426ceca0ccd2a3\n\nThe company\u2019s focus on investing for future services is actually what gets me most excited as it may ward off near-term investor interest and improves its competitive position. It\u2019s also a sign of a mature management team. The opportunity to provide additional services such as working capital, compliance and tax services seems like an obvious strategic move to drive growth. Specifically, working capital is far and away the most important service and something SMBs are desperate for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zi2sl613a5s71.png?width=1664&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e959a0115d4cbb201b531f77ae5276a31026a7d1\n\nWho are their customers and where are they know? 5 million businesses in 190 countries. Customers include Amazon, Wish, Lazada (owned by Alibaba) Shopee, and Ebay. Weird right, they work with Ebay given Paypal does too. This is because they work with countries and specific clients that Paypal not accept into their platform. Investors need to understand that sometimes people have to use other platforms because they the Paypal\u2019s or banks are NOT willing to take the risk. Sure the risk is probably higher but the amount of people that need access to capital or payment process is high when many banks in many countries do not approve people for such type of access.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r1kinxk3a5s71.png?width=1631&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74cd5a7bdb3d3934ce730e1dd9aa9204ff72b259\n\n# Payoneer vs PayPal\n\nThe growth of Payoneer\u2019s global network included a move into India in April 2016, following a partnership with Pune-based IndusInd Bank and expressions of interest in its services from more than 10,000 freelancers and small businesses across the country. \n\n2018 PayPal study suggest that India\u2019s freelancers represent around one quarter of the world\u2019s gig workforce.\n\n**In August 2019, Payoneer announced a year-on-year increase of 400% in its customer base and a threefold increase in payment volumes processed in India.**\n\n*\u201cPayPal says to shut domestic payments business in India\u201d \\~ Reuters*\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - PayPal Holdings Inc will wind down its domestic payments business in India from April 1,2021 the company said in a statement on Friday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gcipi9b4a5s71.png?width=1743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3b20d766db9f0b8302c16582755758489bc479e\n\nB2B global marketplace. The attractiveness of FinTech can be summarized in a few words, namely, \u201cscale\u201d and \u201cnetwork effects\u201d. From the metrics Payoneer shared, it looks like they\u2019re benefitting from these dynamics. Analysts estimate the global B2B market at tens of trillions $ and cross-border payments at $300bn. Obviously the pandemic only accelerated these trends. (From the presentation, it looks like company B2B AR/AP volume more than doubled at 140% in 2020 although the CFO later cited a 53% increase in volumes so not sure exactly how to interpret that.)\n\nVolume and customer growth drives revenues. Volumes grew over 53% in 2020 (67% adjusted for the pandemic) and are expected to grow at 44% and 33% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, which translates into 25% annual revenue growth per year for the next two years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ghmjbjt4a5s71.png?width=1721&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c9dcfa310f5e6a4bc90b66fbf9fc8b018377aa7\n\nThe benefits of network effects cannot be overstated as Paypal has proven. As a company acquires more customers, the value of its network increases. Payoneer\u2019s business model leverages this same dynamic. Moreover, its network would be very difficult to replicate. The company\u2019s global platform includes over 80 banks and clearing partners in over 100 countries. The company also provides customers data about its transactions, which I believe will be increasingly useful and sticky.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z9x3x8b5a5s71.png?width=1797&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=caa49b84156468b94a9f50b9a23ffb208340eba3\n\nWhat do I think the future holds for Payoneer? I actually think there are several exits for this company.\n\n**Growth:**\n\nNote that Payoneer currently doesn\u2019t do B2C, hence it may be quite common for retail to never even have heard of it, unless they are a business or in the gig economy. That is one of the problems for the stock, no one has heard of it (yet) because it works quietly behind the scenes. Given enough funding, who knows, Payoneer may well expand to B2C. Alibaba initially started as B2B as well but has since expanded to B2C (Taobao).\n\nWe just need Payoneer to be 5% of PayPal (ie. $15B market cap) in order for stock price to be in the $30-$40 range. ($6B market cap corresponds to around $13-$15 stock price.) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/95silwp5a5s71.png?width=1748&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f10a138995c52367baa00ed4a10e9287c5da04ee\n\n**Acquisition:**  \n Large international payments processer buys them. Could be Paypal, Square, Stripe, First Data, etc. consolidation WILL happen in this space and I think short-term Payoneer will acquire some companies and then be sold to a bigger company. Think of this as how banks in the USA were allowed to merge in 1995 given the law that passed. Before you had 100,000 banks then it was 50,000 banks, then 10,000 banks and now like 5,000 banks but the top 10 banks make up a large % of the business/volume.\n\nWildcard: CRM business buys them. What many people do not realize is that CRM\u2019s have been changing the game. First it was to help you sell with marketing tools, then it is to improve communication within the team, then it will be storage, and legal transactions then it will be financial transaction. They are literally going to control the beginning to the end of the customer relationship and all of that data they possess is very valuable to help their customers grow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not financial advice, i am not a financial advisor. I have a long position with the warrants that i purchased in February and are therefore in the red.",

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, October 8, 2021**\n\nStocks closed the day modestly in the red but capped off the first week of October in the green as market participants digested the Labor Department\u2019s September Job Report. The move to the upside earlier in the week came after Senate came to an agreement to raise the debt ceiling into early December, helping avoid a catastrophic government default. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed the day 0.18% lower but the week 1.12% higher, the Nasdaq (QQQ) closed the day 0.5% lower but the week 0.69% higher, and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed the day even and the week 1.41% higher.\n\nAfter the first negative month all year, the move higher in equities came after the Senate came to an agreement to raise the debt ceiling until early December, preventing a catastrophic government that would\u2019ve taken place around Oct 18. On Thursday, the chamber voted to raise the debt limit by $480 billion. \n\nWith concerns over a government default dissipating, market participants turned their attention to the latest monthly jobs report from the Labor market, which showed the second consecutive month of payroll gains greatly lagging behind estimates. Non-farm payrolls rose by only 194,000 in September versus the 500,000 expected. The unemployment rate fell more than expected to 4.8%, though this positive development came alongside a disappointing drop in the labor force participation rate to 61.6%, versus 61.7% in August. And the size of the civilian labor force actually contracted in September, with the gap between the size of the labor force in February 2020 and last month topping 3 million. \n\nThough employers added just 194,000 jobs in September, the economy has now regained half of the jobs deficit it faced in December, compared with pre-pandemic employment levels. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last month that he'd only need to see a \"decent\" September U.S. jobs report to be ready to begin to taper in November. It is very likely the tapering of quantitative easing will be announced this month and commence in November. \n\nFriday's jobs report stood in stark contrast to other, stronger-than-expected data on the state of the labor market in the U.S. New weekly jobless claims came in at their second-lowest since March 2020. Here are the numbers \n\n* **Initial unemployment claims:** 326,000 vs. 348,000 expected and an upwardly revised 364,000 during prior week\n* **Continuing claims:** 2.714 million vs. 2.766 million expected and an upwardly revised 2.811 million during prior week \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The[ Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said Friday that it reached a deal ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-minimum-corporate-tax-rate-162842722.html)among 136 countries to ensure major companies pay a minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. \"The landmark deal, agreed by 136 countries and jurisdictions representing more than 90% of global GDP, will also reallocate more than USD 125 billion of profits from around 100 of the world\u2019s largest and most profitable MNEs to countries worldwide, ensuring that these firms pay a fair share of tax wherever they operate and generate profits,\" the OECD said in a statement\n* Facebook (FB) said some users were once again having trouble accessing its product on Friday, another disruption following the hours-long one earlier this week and another blow to the already beleaguered company. \u201cWe\u2019re aware that some people are having trouble accessing our apps and products,\u201d Facebook [said in a post](https://twitter.com/Facebook/status/1446556732977778695) on Twitter. \u201cWe\u2019re working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible and we apologize for any inconvenience.\u201d \n* Elon Musk announced Tesla is moving its headquarters from Silicon Valley to Austin, Texas. He said that Tesla plans to expand its activities in California but that the company\u2019s ability to scale up in the San Francisco Bay Area is limited.\n* EU antitrust regulators are following up on a complaint by Slack Technologies, which is owned by Salesforce (CRM) by asking Microsoft's rivals if its Teams app integrated with its Office product is anti-competitive. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* AON target raised by Wells Fargo from $306 to $321 at Ovoverweight.

        "selftext": "We are officially in October and it is proving to be rather turbulent. Coming off of one of the worst days all year, the major indices did rebound and take back some of the losses. Today is a write up where I go through all the old alerts, push a reset, and create many new ones. \n\nIt was no surprise that we the S&amp;P had its first red month all year last month. The question is will our portfolios keep being drug down by inflation and debt ceiling woes. If you are not already, now is the time to dollar cost average on your long term positions, and pick yourself out some new mid term positions that you think will perform well in the winter months. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n#  First let's take a look at some of my favorites.\n\n**TQQQ** has given up a lot of ground since it's all time high on September 7th. It is now approaching the 180MA, and the RSI is really low. It could be a great time to average into this position. If you prefer options, a bounce of the 180 alerts has been set. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ceb8y1sjqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3611585e424b757718c9dba3f0afefadb634c9a8\n\n **UPRO** is not as bad as **TQQQ**, and that is quite normal according to Trend Spider's seasonality. Usually this time of year, the Nasdaq does worse out of all the indices. Now we see that tech is getting hammered. I'd also DCA into this one.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vh23d1szjqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a31491eb4a487f24f2f872db5e11f32ca41e89e\n\n **UDOW** is probably a great pick up right now for your buy and hold portfolio. It is riding along the 180MA, and if you can get an entry there, start to DCA.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o66oyzrzjqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3dc213a55397d60bda38aba21253948b96b66579\n\n **SOXL** is notorious in our community for money printing swings. I'd say it might have bottomed out of now. There seems to be a 50/50 chance over the past decade that SOXL is up/down in October. Since it is already down, I'd say grab some, and continue to as long as it is going down. Red day buy; green day hold. Let it run until mid November. Hope you are paying attention :D \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j6vay1szjqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=514b94aa0482e335d9bb7f44031b54edef361497\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n#  Crypto \n\n **CRO**, the native Crypto.com token and one of my favorites right now has made a wonderful recovery bounce off of the 180MA. It is now back at 18 cents. Don't sleep on this one. They are now the sponsors of the UFC and the Philadelphia 76ers. I think this is a 10x play. I think the right play here is buy what you can afford: $400, $4000 or $40000. Stake those in their app (for up to 14%apy), since it is a long term play anyways we don't need to use this money. After, you will unlock their metal Visa card. My recommendation is run all your monthly expenses through it and you'll be getting 2-5% back in **CRO** which you continue holding.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wowtpr22kqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6294fca8217fde87067615877a990b4f57565db3\n\n \n\n**BTC** has made a huge recovery this week, and if you are already diversified with BTC exposure congratulate yourself. If not, maybe its time to start considering it. If traditional equity markets are not doing well, money sometimes flows to crypto - and vice versa. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4g8tbdb3kqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1fcc81b846310ed2c490c7dd4498fc90d0cda68\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n#  Alerts \n\n A **WMT** opportunity found by my VIP Discord members. First of all, the seasonality improves a lot in November and the RSI looks way to over sold. I like a bounce off of the the lower support of a paralell channel that it seems to be trading in. This could be a good chance for some EOY calls either now, or wait for bounce.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qztvc4h8kqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=012816a5a8ba2a561beaadecb7a9fee4cc4d3b7a\n\n **XHB**, a homebuilders ETF, LEAPS look ripe for the picking. This would be a long term position with exposure to the US new homes sector, which I don't think will slow down any time soon.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d3sallk9kqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09d918825aedf4ff92ceb2917309b12ba69ccba8\n\n Here is an interesting opportunity for some puts on **CRM** I believe to have found. We are close to all time high, and the seasonality starts to suck going into December. I can't really say the exact point where we buy the puts, but I think maybe around $280. We can even buy vertical spreads for $270/$260 with a December expiration. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kctpebkakqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3d15a26bfe10680a774553e53c78204b3a97a3e\n\n **NKE** has also taken a beating and will probably have decent holiday sales as always. Actually, this alert was already set and expired before it triggered. It is basically riding along the 180MA and the YTD VWAP. Could be a good pick up now, or wait for a confirmation bounce.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nu6sb4jbkqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8f911359729ed6031498e5aae401a786bf2ff98\n\n Same with my **HD** alert. It triggered last week but I was on vacation and missed it. If you bought, you'd be making money. I'll be resetting the alerts for a VWAP bounce and trying again.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tb2uejeckqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=985ad4ea1a62d29579da96945a756cc0da8a614c\n\n I'm still liking these **SPOT** puts as I don't believe in the long term growth of this company. It seems like the resistance drawn out is true and is holding. If continues, there is an opportunity to arb calls and puts between the resistance and glass bottom (yellow). \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hcie2cgdkqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10f8bd58cebd73066512ce8e675a98095ac1cdae\n\n Still continue to play **DIS** on its yoyo like bounce on the glass bottom. Usually **DIS's** seasonality improves in the winter months, especially in November. I still like EOY calls, probably taking profit in November.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2lclpzaekqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=329098a02d6d7b241e153cb149a12cb84693ba8a\n\n It is interesting that this time, when BTC ran, **EBON** didn't. One of my highest conviction plays, I'll wait for the bounce down from the 50MA as usual. **EBON** is a crap company, with crap products, that industry insiders joke about.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ozpj252fkqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3bb701f35e2d14a8945e771a8787425fc8698885\n\n **MCB** is a tricky play, but, like I thought, it is holding resistance. I think its a matter of time before it pulls back. If we see it break the resistance, then I'll cut. Go small here.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vf7usk4gkqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d18e08d1ea0c8c33cbfbf1fc788e3566e3ec7ffb\n\n **SBUX** is around major supports and has somewhat of a nice volume shelf propping it up. Seasonality is good for October and November as cold caffeine addicted shoppers go out and need warm pick-me-uppers. I like calls off of the volume shelf expiring EOY and taking profits possibly in November.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n2lkvt0hkqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bfe6ac15beda08ad064d92c429436c65b943e2f0\n\n Lastly for today, I still like **T** puts off of the 50MA. Another company that I don't believe in long term growth; this is a good opportunity to continue the ride down. I would keep positions small and take profits quick, although it seems that there is more than a 50% chance that month over month is negative.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rpqh90yhkqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0dca69da6cd687c47ad06854a75b9fa5779f1ccd\n\n \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n    Disclaimer: The comments opinions and analysis expressed herein are for informational and educational purpose only and should not be considered as individual advice or recommendations.",

        "selftext": "I'm sure some of you have heard a little bit about the ORB Strategy whether that be through different online communities or educational content. This is a very simple, easy to use strategy that allows you to see when breakouts or breakdowns are happening on a specific stock. I am going to show you how the strategy works and how to use it as well as give you the studies to put on your ThinkorSwim charts, give you the scanners to scan for stocks that had a breakout or breakdown, and give you an easy to read column to add to your watchlist to see what stocks are breaking up or down. Let\u2019s jump into it!\n\n### How It Works\n\nThere are several ways to trade this strategy but first let's talk real quick about how it works. The way the opening range strategy works is it takes the highest price of a stock within the first 30 minutes of the day and the low of the first 30 minutes of the day and draws lines for both. So let's breakdown a quick example. Say TSLA opens the day at $575, then within the first 30 minutes it has a high of $578 and a low of $571 within that first 30 minutes of the market being open. This strategy will draw a line at $278 and a line at $271 on your chart. Then you can play the chart multiple ways off of those lines, let\u2019s take a look at the most common strategies.\n\nThe strategy will also create a grey box highlighting the first 30 minutes of the day. It will also draw a line at the \"midpoint\" or the middle of the opening range high and low.\n\nYou can check out the full article and other useful stock information here: [https://thebreadmakerr.com](https://thebreadmakerr.com)\n\n### Opening Range Breakout\n\n[TGT Orb Breakout Chart Example](https://preview.redd.it/psb4y7bsp3u71.jpg?width=1456&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e9c4b29019dc108da2c1f3d126ff4c5afc04324)\n\nAs you can see from the chart above, all the lines and data are already drawn out for you. You can also see the stock break above the red line, that would ideally be your entry for a long or call position. You can then see the stock has a nice run-up after the breakout. This is the most common way to play the ORB strategy.\n\n### Opening Range Breakdown\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[CRM Orb Breakdown Chart Example](https://preview.redd.it/zrqpxizwp3u71.jpg?width=1456&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69695c894ee8168537b4f6e4f652c3ec171df4ae)\n\nThe second most common is the Opening Range Breakdown, this is essentially the opposite of the breakout, you are watching for the stock to break the bottom ORB line and then you would enter a short or put position and as you can see the stock continues to dive lower.\n\n### Opening Range - Support/Resistance\n\n[AIG Orb Support\\/Resistance Chart Example](https://preview.redd.it/n0tutez4q3u71.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4dfebb4e620b2cbdbcda3cce62e5381a55adda1)\n\nThe final way to play this is as an intraday Support/Resistance channel. AIG chart above is a good example of that. You can see how the stock just traded a little sideways right on that bottom ORB and then bounced up off of it. You can play this the reverse way as well if the stock trades sideways up at the top of the ORB.\n\n***Important Tips:***\n\n* When playing this strategy make sure you are utilizing the 5 minute chart.\n* When using the breakout or breakdown strategy, DO NOT enter the trade until the 5 minute candle has closed above or below the top or bottom orb.\n\n### Scanners\n\nI will also provide a scanner that will scan for all the stocks that are above the top ORB as well as all the stocks that are below the bottom ORB. This is great because maybe you don't have a lot of stocks on your watchlist, well this will scan the whole market for stocks and pull all the ones that have a breakout or breakdown. The possibilities of finding a trade everyday are endless! This scanner always finds a bunch of stocks everyday for you to trade.\n\nHere are all the studies you can add to your ThinkorSwim platform to get started with trading the ORB strategy:\n\n#### Opening Range Breakout Chart Study:\n\n[**http://tos.mx/U3wNJQ**](http://tos.mx/U3wNJQ)\n\n**Opening Range Breakout(Above Top ORB) Scanner:**\n\n[**http://tos.mx/OfhG4K**](http://tos.mx/OfhG4K)\n\n**Opening Range Breakdown(Below Bottom ORB) Scanner:**\n\n[**http://tos.mx/yHriZl**](http://tos.mx/yHriZl)\n\nHopefully you find this information helpful and it makes trading easier for you.

The company provides B2B services for millions of SMB and enterprises around the world\n\nThe growth of Payoneer\u2019s global network included a move into India in April 2016, following a partnership with Pune-based IndusInd Bank and expressions of interest in its services from more than 10,000 freelancers and small businesses across the country.\n\n2018 PayPal study suggest that India\u2019s freelancers represent around one quarter of the world\u2019s gig workforce.\n\n**In August 2019, Payoneer announced a year-on-year increase of 400% in its customer base and a threefold increase in payment volumes processed in India.**\n\n*\u201cPayPal says to shut domestic payments business in India\u201d \\~ Reuters*\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - PayPal Holdings Inc will wind down its domestic payments business in India from April 1,2021 the company said in a statement on Friday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9rrj0833sat71.png?width=1743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad4715120c225a20fd5da5d8da4fb89bbc4b83b5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uowbl3v8sat71.png?width=1759&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a560d2142e3760e7d89d193d6b62955c6893bed8\n\nThe ideal customer is a small but growing SMB doing business all over the world which needs currency, compliance and business services. Payoneer is an obvious candidate to handles these needs given its global network.\n\n\u00b7 Payoneer offers vendors the ability to move money with a U.S. bank account and pay suppliers, without having to deal with too many banking hurdles or red tape.\n\n\u00b7 A lot of freelancers on Upwork.com use Payoneer because many of them live in countries that Upwork.com can't wire money to.\n\n\u00b7 Once vendors receive funds into their Payoneer account they can either withdraw the cash using their Payoneer provided Master Card or do a direct bank transfer from Payoneer to their local bank. Usually funds arrive within 1-2 business days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o40qgu9asat71.png?width=1764&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5596b4dd2c17be9682661b158ef44b1c333e3cd\n\nSo, it is basically a bank that includes an accountant to help meet a business\u2019 needs. The one product or feature that is missing is digital coins.\n\nSay a consumer wants to rent an airbnb. They use a credit card (or other payment method) to pay airbnb, a payment gateway facilitates payment acceptance. The payment is then processed and Airbnb ends up with the money from the transaction. Airbnb has now gathered cash through its acquirers (e.g., Adyen, ACI). Airbnb now needs to distribute funds to its SMB sellers. Airbnb uses payoneer to disburse funds to sellers. From this example, you can see Payoneer isn't competing with companies like Adyen or other acquirers/ processors, even though they are processing payments.\n\nPayoneer signs up individual sellers, which allows the sellers to use payoneer across platforms (e.g., facebook marketplace and amazon). Hyperwallet (owned by PayPal) is one of their competitors, but Hyperwallet operates completely differently, they sign up users via the platform, but this means you can't use hyperwallet for your business on both amazon and fb marketplace without going through the onboarding process again. Given the trend towards SMB sellers operating across multiple marketplaces, this is a huge benefit for payoneer, and makes PayPal's offering a lot less competitive. It also means Payoneer owns the seller relationship in a way that PayPal doesn't do as effectively, and makes it easier for them to package other offerings (e.g., working capital). These other offerings provide a two-fold benefit - their customer relationships become stronger, so revenue is seen as more recurring and investors will pay a higher multiple; and they'll make more money per customer.\n\nMy view is that Payoneer should see an S-type growth curve, where they'll hit a critical mass of users and see exponential growth, like cashapp, or venmo. Their investor presentation projects 25% revenue growth over the next couple years, I think this is super conservative, especially considering that 25% growth rate doesn't account for the two travel related marketplaces that got screwed by covid. Once they hit that critical mass of users, they'll pop off, sales &amp; marketing expenses will drop, and they'll become profitable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4f5p7p4bsat71.png?width=1556&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8fdc4fe48c2b315e52e72f9f2298774b25797e44\n\nThe company\u2019s focus on investing for future services is actually what gets me most excited as it may ward off near-term investor interest and improves its competitive position. It\u2019s also a sign of a mature management team. The opportunity to provide additional services such as working capital, compliance and tax services seems like an obvious strategic move to drive growth. Specifically, working capital is far and away the most important service and something SMBs are desperate for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qf2jitgcsat71.png?width=1664&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa1c99eea1a28ffd6daea019c3487fd5cb81d491\n\nWho are their customers and where are they know? 5 million businesses in 190 countries. Customers include Amazon, Wish, Lazada (owned by Alibaba) Shopee, and Ebay. Weird right, they work with Ebay given Paypal does too. This is because they work with countries and specific clients that Paypal not accept into their platform. Investors need to understand that sometimes people have to use other platforms because they the Paypal\u2019s or banks are NOT willing to take the risk. Sure the risk is probably higher but the amount of people that need access to capital or payment process is high when many banks in many countries do not approve people for such type of access.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2pnuk7qdsat71.png?width=1631&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b8660ceffe034f8b7498e9ecbbcff125319603f\n\nB2B global marketplace. The attractiveness of FinTech can be summarized in a few words, namely, \u201cscale\u201d and \u201cnetwork effects\u201d. From the metrics Payoneer shared, it looks like they\u2019re benefitting from these dynamics. Analysts estimate the global B2B market at tens of trillions $ and cross-border payments at $300bn. Obviously the pandemic only accelerated these trends. (From the presentation, it looks like company B2B AR/AP volume more than doubled at 140% in 2020 although the CFO later cited a 53% increase in volumes so not sure exactly how to interpret that.)\n\nVolume and customer growth drives revenues. Volumes grew over 53% in 2020 (67% adjusted for the pandemic) and are expected to grow at 44% and 33% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, which translates into 25% annual revenue growth per year for the next two years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/od34rmcfsat71.png?width=1721&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ccf0f50c53f232f0aba3f9fa8c991bf7ca57bebf\n\nThe benefits of network effects cannot be overstated as Paypal has proven. As a company acquires more customers, the value of its network increases. Payoneer\u2019s business model leverages this same dynamic. Moreover, its network would be very difficult to replicate. The company\u2019s global platform includes over 80 banks and clearing partners in over 100 countries. The company also provides customers data about its transactions, which I believe will be increasingly useful and sticky.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v11jgevfsat71.png?width=1797&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa74e5f35fab8445965b808f51c9ffc127c9b996\n\nWhat do I think the future holds for Payoneer? I actually think there are several exits for this company.\n\n**Growth:**\n\nNote that Payoneer currently doesn\u2019t do B2C, hence it may be quite common for retail to never even have heard of it, unless they are a business or in the gig economy. That is one of the problems for the stock, no one has heard of it (yet) because it works quietly behind the scenes. Given enough funding, who knows, Payoneer may well expand to B2C. Alibaba initially started as B2B as well but has since expanded to B2C (Taobao).\n\nWe just need Payoneer to be 5% of PayPal (ie. $15B market cap) in order for stock price to be in the $30-$40 range. ($6B market cap corresponds to around $13-$15 stock price.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wmk4m3ahsat71.png?width=1748&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2750ff0f2636323c20a686f11243fc2af5fbd085\n\n\\*\\*Acquisition:\\*\\*Large international payments processer buys them. Could be Paypal, Square, Stripe, First Data, etc. consolidation WILL happen in this space and I think short-term Payoneer will acquire some companies and then be sold to a bigger company. Think of this as how banks in the USA were allowed to merge in 1995 given the law that passed. Before you had 100,000 banks then it was 50,000 banks, then 10,000 banks and now like 5,000 banks but the top 10 banks make up a large % of the business/volume.\n\nWildcard: CRM business buys them. What many people do not realize is that CRM\u2019s have been changing the game. First it was to help you sell with marketing tools, then it is to improve communication within the team, then it will be storage, and legal transactions then it will be financial transaction. They are literally going to control the beginning to the end of the customer relationship and all of that data they possess is very valuable to help their customers grow.\n\nThis is not financial advice, i am not a financial advisor. I have a long position with the warrants that i purchased in February and are therefore in the red.",

The company provides B2B services for millions of SMB and enterprises around the world\n\nThe growth of Payoneer\u2019s global network included a move into India in April 2016, following a partnership with Pune-based IndusInd Bank and expressions of interest in its services from more than 10,000 freelancers and small businesses across the country.\n\n2018 PayPal study suggest that India\u2019s freelancers represent around one quarter of the world\u2019s gig workforce.\n\n**In August 2019, Payoneer announced a year-on-year increase of 400% in its customer base and a threefold increase in payment volumes processed in India.**\n\n*\u201cPayPal says to shut domestic payments business in India\u201d \\~ Reuters*\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - PayPal Holdings Inc will wind down its domestic payments business in India from April 1,2021 the company said in a statement on Friday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2jpn0g1g1mt71.png?width=1743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a1a64476a3317afae3108fef508fcbb30e82334\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dznwfh1g1mt71.png?width=1759&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5124881de74bd5776ffa602093e2fb4b0dc1a33\n\nThe ideal customer is a small but growing SMB doing business all over the world which needs currency, compliance and business services. Payoneer is an obvious candidate to handles these needs given its global network.\n\n\u00b7 Payoneer offers vendors the ability to move money with a U.S. bank account and pay suppliers, without having to deal with too many banking hurdles or red tape.\n\n\u00b7 A lot of freelancers on Upwork.com use Payoneer because many of them live in countries that Upwork.com can't wire money to.\n\n\u00b7 Once vendors receive funds into their Payoneer account they can either withdraw the cash using their Payoneer provided Master Card or do a direct bank transfer from Payoneer to their local bank. Usually funds arrive within 1-2 business days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ursv3xni1mt71.png?width=1764&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=416a02f6f69d40160a25368aa5b52412a43dc03f\n\nSo, it is basically a bank that includes an accountant to help meet a business\u2019 needs. The one product or feature that is missing is digital coins.\n\nSay a consumer wants to rent an airbnb. They use a credit card (or other payment method) to pay airbnb, a payment gateway facilitates payment acceptance. The payment is then processed and Airbnb ends up with the money from the transaction. Airbnb has now gathered cash through its acquirers (e.g., Adyen, ACI). Airbnb now needs to distribute funds to its SMB sellers. Airbnb uses payoneer to disburse funds to sellers. From this example, you can see Payoneer isn't competing with companies like Adyen or other acquirers/ processors, even though they are processing payments.\n\nPayoneer signs up individual sellers, which allows the sellers to use payoneer across platforms (e.g., facebook marketplace and amazon). Hyperwallet (owned by PayPal) is one of their competitors, but Hyperwallet operates completely differently, they sign up users via the platform, but this means you can't use hyperwallet for your business on both amazon and fb marketplace without going through the onboarding process again. Given the trend towards SMB sellers operating across multiple marketplaces, this is a huge benefit for payoneer, and makes PayPal's offering a lot less competitive. It also means Payoneer owns the seller relationship in a way that PayPal doesn't do as effectively, and makes it easier for them to package other offerings (e.g., working capital). These other offerings provide a two-fold benefit - their customer relationships become stronger, so revenue is seen as more recurring and investors will pay a higher multiple; and they'll make more money per customer.\n\nMy view is that Payoneer should see an S-type growth curve, where they'll hit a critical mass of users and see exponential growth, like cashapp, or venmo. Their investor presentation projects 25% revenue growth over the next couple years, I think this is super conservative, especially considering that 25% growth rate doesn't account for the two travel related marketplaces that got screwed by covid. Once they hit that critical mass of users, they'll pop off, sales &amp; marketing expenses will drop, and they'll become profitable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fpkfaeej1mt71.png?width=1556&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=271bbdbdf04feb827fb0328d559a6c35f712fe83\n\nThe company\u2019s focus on investing for future services is actually what gets me most excited as it may ward off near-term investor interest and improves its competitive position. It\u2019s also a sign of a mature management team. The opportunity to provide additional services such as working capital, compliance and tax services seems like an obvious strategic move to drive growth. Specifically, working capital is far and away the most important service and something SMBs are desperate for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/46ucpp0l1mt71.png?width=1664&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa8f9ebe61044697e9d25ce87d60dbfff21ac5b4\n\nWho are their customers and where are they know? 5 million businesses in 190 countries. Customers include Amazon, Wish, Lazada (owned by Alibaba) Shopee, and Ebay. Weird right, they work with Ebay given Paypal does too. This is because they work with countries and specific clients that Paypal not accept into their platform. Investors need to understand that sometimes people have to use other platforms because they the Paypal\u2019s or banks are NOT willing to take the risk. Sure the risk is probably higher but the amount of people that need access to capital or payment process is high when many banks in many countries do not approve people for such type of access.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8xllcnxl1mt71.png?width=1631&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd07935b0b199fd61526d416977a3356edeee74a\n\nB2B global marketplace. The attractiveness of FinTech can be summarized in a few words, namely, \u201cscale\u201d and \u201cnetwork effects\u201d. From the metrics Payoneer shared, it looks like they\u2019re benefitting from these dynamics. Analysts estimate the global B2B market at tens of trillions $ and cross-border payments at $300bn. Obviously the pandemic only accelerated these trends. (From the presentation, it looks like company B2B AR/AP volume more than doubled at 140% in 2020 although the CFO later cited a 53% increase in volumes so not sure exactly how to interpret that.)\n\nVolume and customer growth drives revenues. Volumes grew over 53% in 2020 (67% adjusted for the pandemic) and are expected to grow at 44% and 33% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, which translates into 25% annual revenue growth per year for the next two years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/485pmwpm1mt71.png?width=1721&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8daa57cf167cfc5c1b01a8aa204a423591962be\n\nThe benefits of network effects cannot be overstated as Paypal has proven. As a company acquires more customers, the value of its network increases. Payoneer\u2019s business model leverages this same dynamic. Moreover, its network would be very difficult to replicate. The company\u2019s global platform includes over 80 banks and clearing partners in over 100 countries. The company also provides customers data about its transactions, which I believe will be increasingly useful and sticky.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kvevrmgn1mt71.png?width=1797&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8cdb86125b0e06bde979bcaf48804903e0de4d98\n\nWhat do I think the future holds for Payoneer? I actually think there are several exits for this company.\n\n**Growth:**\n\nNote that Payoneer currently doesn\u2019t do B2C, hence it may be quite common for retail to never even have heard of it, unless they are a business or in the gig economy. That is one of the problems for the stock, no one has heard of it (yet) because it works quietly behind the scenes. Given enough funding, who knows, Payoneer may well expand to B2C. Alibaba initially started as B2B as well but has since expanded to B2C (Taobao).\n\nWe just need Payoneer to be 5% of PayPal (ie. $15B market cap) in order for stock price to be in the $30-$40 range. ($6B market cap corresponds to around $13-$15 stock price.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3cqivcao1mt71.png?width=1748&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5cc3a4a9e6fe91197b98a14a09dc2f053fd8ce0d\n\n\\*\\*Acquisition:\\*\\*Large international payments processer buys them. Could be Paypal, Square, Stripe, First Data, etc. consolidation WILL happen in this space and I think short-term Payoneer will acquire some companies and then be sold to a bigger company. Think of this as how banks in the USA were allowed to merge in 1995 given the law that passed. Before you had 100,000 banks then it was 50,000 banks, then 10,000 banks and now like 5,000 banks but the top 10 banks make up a large % of the business/volume.\n\nWildcard: CRM business buys them. What many people do not realize is that CRM\u2019s have been changing the game. First it was to help you sell with marketing tools, then it is to improve communication within the team, then it will be storage, and legal transactions then it will be financial transaction. They are literally going to control the beginning to the end of the customer relationship and all of that data they possess is very valuable to help their customers grow.\n\nThis is not financial advice, i am not a financial advisor. I have a long position with the warrants that i purchased in February and are therefore in the red.",

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, October 8, 2021**\n\nStocks closed the day modestly in the red but capped off the first week of October in the green as market participants digested the Labor Department\u2019s September Job Report. The move to the upside earlier in the week came after Senate came to an agreement to raise the debt ceiling into early December, helping avoid a catastrophic government default. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed the day 0.18% lower but the week 1.12% higher, the Nasdaq (QQQ) closed the day 0.5% lower but the week 0.69% higher, and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed the day even and the week 1.41% higher.\n\nAfter the first negative month all year, the move higher in equities came after the Senate came to an agreement to raise the debt ceiling until early December, preventing a catastrophic government that would\u2019ve taken place around Oct 18. On Thursday, the chamber voted to raise the debt limit by $480 billion. \n\nWith concerns over a government default dissipating, market participants turned their attention to the latest monthly jobs report from the Labor market, which showed the second consecutive month of payroll gains greatly lagging behind estimates. Non-farm payrolls rose by only 194,000 in September versus the 500,000 expected. The unemployment rate fell more than expected to 4.8%, though this positive development came alongside a disappointing drop in the labor force participation rate to 61.6%, versus 61.7% in August. And the size of the civilian labor force actually contracted in September, with the gap between the size of the labor force in February 2020 and last month topping 3 million. \n\nThough employers added just 194,000 jobs in September, the economy has now regained half of the jobs deficit it faced in December, compared with pre-pandemic employment levels. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last month that he'd only need to see a \"decent\" September U.S. jobs report to be ready to begin to taper in November. It is very likely the tapering of quantitative easing will be announced this month and commence in November. \n\nFriday's jobs report stood in stark contrast to other, stronger-than-expected data on the state of the labor market in the U.S. New weekly jobless claims came in at their second-lowest since March 2020. Here are the numbers \n\n* **Initial unemployment claims:** 326,000 vs. 348,000 expected and an upwardly revised 364,000 during prior week\n* **Continuing claims:** 2.714 million vs. 2.766 million expected and an upwardly revised 2.811 million during prior week \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The[ Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said Friday that it reached a deal ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-minimum-corporate-tax-rate-162842722.html)among 136 countries to ensure major companies pay a minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. \"The landmark deal, agreed by 136 countries and jurisdictions representing more than 90% of global GDP, will also reallocate more than USD 125 billion of profits from around 100 of the world\u2019s largest and most profitable MNEs to countries worldwide, ensuring that these firms pay a fair share of tax wherever they operate and generate profits,\" the OECD said in a statement\n* Facebook (FB) said some users were once again having trouble accessing its product on Friday, another disruption following the hours-long one earlier this week and another blow to the already beleaguered company. \u201cWe\u2019re aware that some people are having trouble accessing our apps and products,\u201d Facebook [said in a post](https://twitter.com/Facebook/status/1446556732977778695) on Twitter. \u201cWe\u2019re working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible and we apologize for any inconvenience.\u201d \n* Elon Musk announced Tesla is moving its headquarters from Silicon Valley to Austin, Texas. He said that Tesla plans to expand its activities in California but that the company\u2019s ability to scale up in the San Francisco Bay Area is limited.\n* EU antitrust regulators are following up on a complaint by Slack Technologies, which is owned by Salesforce (CRM) by asking Microsoft's rivals if its Teams app integrated with its Office product is anti-competitive. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* AON target raised by Wells Fargo from $306 to $321 at Ovoverweight.

        "selftext": "# Altus\u2019 Business and Competitive Position \n\nAltus is a clean electrification company that develops, owns, and operates solar systems and energy storage for commercial customers, communities, and residential customers. Altus has been profitable for years, with 50-60% EBITDA margins, and expects to grow EBITDA by \\~77% annually through 2024.\n\n**Altus is led by highly capable, seasoned founders**:\n\n* Lars Norell (co-founder and co-CEO) was previously a Principal and Managing Director at Cohen &amp; Company where he served as Head of Capital Markets and subsequently led the Alternative Assets effort. Before joining Cohen &amp; Company, Norell was an MD and Co-Head of US Structured Credit Products at Merrill Lynch. \n* Greg Felton (co-founder and co-CEO) was a partner at Goldman Sachs and the Chief Investment Officer of the Credit Alternatives platform at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.\n\n**Altus is ahead of the pack and expanding its service offerings; capital from + partnership with CBRE should put it even further ahead**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3zg3h3pvw2r71.png?width=1420&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6e5189474922c2f4a25224c172c5b81d299cfce\n\n*Two of the largest players in commercial real estate are on Altus\u2019 side* \n\n* CBAH was formed by CBRE and Blackstone has been a long-time investor in Altus (its ownership is currently 17%). \n* Through Blackstone, Altus has access to the most efficient debt and tax equity financing within a fragmented industry where others do not. \n* CBRE is the world\u2019s largest commercial real estate services firm. CBRE manages 7 billion square feet of commercial real estate and $8 billion of energy spend annually.  \n   * (More detail on CBRE\u2019s ability to directly add value on p.3)\n* CBRE also currently possesses over 20 billion data points stored in its Enterprise Data Platform for the CRE assets it operates; CBRE plans to leverage its Data &amp; Analytic capabilities to create a new software tool capable of analyzing client portfolios to aid in identifying attractive opportunities for Altus Power and for clients.\n* CBRE and Blackstone give Altus a considerable edge over competitors.\n\n*Altus\u2019 customers are highly reliable*\n\n* Not a single payment default in its history of more than a decade\n\n*Multiple additional growth opportunities*\n\n* Altus is beginning to build out EV charging stations at office buildings, which are an ideal place to install EV chargers given that employee cars sit idle all day long. And unlike most charging stations, users can actually see that their electricity is coming directly from a clean source.\n* U.S. cumulative **installed battery storage** is anticipated to **grow at \\~49% annually** to 54 GWh2 by 2030.\n\n## The CBAH Transaction and Valuation\n\n**Interests between all stakeholders are aligned to an exceptional degree and CBRE is in a position to add substantial value**\n\n* Existing investors and management are not only rolling 100% but are also investing $25M in the PIPE.\n* CBRE is investing $75M in the PIPE and has provided a commitment to backstop up to $150M of SPAC redemptions at the same terms as the PIPE.\n* Moreover, CBAH agreed to the \u201cSAIL\u201d promote structure from the get-go, which means the entire promote (which is already capped at 15%) is earned over time as share price appreciates. \n   * The first sponsor shares are earned when shares reach $12.\n\n*\\* Notes regarding CBAH warrants: $11.00 strike price and \u00bc warrant coverage \\**\n\n**Altus is valued at an EBITDA multiple discount to** ***qualitatively*** **comparable (residential) solar companies, which have inferior financials and growth** \n\n[\\*as of 10\\/01](https://preview.redd.it/fsx37cetx2r71.png?width=2328&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=718bd491723d2aa7595c037b6f29160c3cf85a79)\n\n**Altus\u2019 projections are conservative and CBRE can meaningfully add value** \n\n* Their current 900+ MW pipeline represents a \\~2.0x coverage over the 445 MW required to achieve 2022 annualized EBITDA\n* Further, the projections do *not* include the potentially massive windfall from their partnership with CBRE.\n* Unlike the vast majority of SPAC sponsors, CBRE is not only highly incentivized to add value, they are actually in a position to do so in a direct and substantial way.\n\n**CBRE Direct Value Add**\n\n[Note: 2023 EV is conservative given that SPWR is currently valued at \\~28 x 2022 EBITDA.](https://preview.redd.it/033etx89y2r71.png?width=1244&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9d465df62327901b831ad144e7871e400dd036e)\n\n# Potential Risks and Concerns Identified and Addressed\n\n**Altus\u2019 employee count to market cap ratio is dramatically low than peers**\n\nAlthough the comps cited in the investor presentation appear to be *truly comparable* in terms of the quality of leadership, product offering, market position, scale, etc., Altus currently employs far fewer people than its peers (according to LinkedIn).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ux2htm2my2r71.png?width=944&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=901e6a9348875cc7822ceca069e0d710999d8ee6\n\nThis difference is eye-catching; and it\u2019s possibly indicative of a less robust and capable company. To the extent that meeting projections will require increased hiring efforts, both recruiting and integrating capable employees could prove to be a major hurdle. \n\nThere is reason to think this might *not* be cause for concern, though. This low ratio could very well be a result of Altus operating predominantly in the commercial, industrial, and community solar markets \u2013 where customer offtake is much larger and a far smaller salesforce is needed compared to the residential marketplace. Indeed, Altus cites a low customer acquisition cost as a positive differentiator between it and residential solar companies and its margins are significantly higher. (Altus is compared to residential solar companies since there are no public commercial solar companies.) Relatedly, Altus states in the presentation that they rely on contractors and third parties for both installation and sales sourcing. So Altus may employ a relatively high number of contract workers and/or manual workers who do not show up in online searches. \n\n**Public comps are volatile and are now considerably lower (\\~10-15%) than they were when the CBAH deal was announced**\n\nThere is risk of this downward trend extending to the date of the merger (Q4 2021). With that said, this is already factored into the valuation math on p.2, which demonstrates Altus\u2019 discount to comps relative to both 2022 and 2023 EBITDA. And volatility is a double-edged sword, especially with respect to the value of warrants, which should benefit from higher volatility (theoretically, at least). \n\n**Altus lacks a significant technological moat**\n\nAltus does not produce its panels, nor does it have sophisticated proprietary energy storage technology like Stem. Altus does, however, have some software technology IP and data. Here\u2019s what Norell said about this during the analyst day presentation:\n\n&gt;Two years ago \\[we built\\] our own monitoring software, which we named Gaia, and since that time we have also built asset registries and stored all the data coming out of our designs and systems and equipment choices and added the functionalities described on this page... what we were planning to do next is to scale Gaia in two directions... for asset servicing, predictive maintenance of our solar assets using machine learning and AI, and for origination of new customers and assets, develop a customer interface that we can use to originate both commercial and community solar customers. We\u2019ve started collaborating with CBRE on both of these initiatives.\n\nNevertheless, the ultimate benefit of this software and data is not all that clear. So it\u2019s reasonable to assign it little to no value at this point. However, where Altus may have an underappreciated moat is in financing and managing its projects. Unlike residential solar, which has standardized financing, each commercial solar project has a high degree of customization and complexity. Often the work and expense involved in acquiring a customer and securing financing makes deals with commercial customers unworkable. ([Forbes](https://www.google.com/search?q=untpped+comercial+and+industrial+solar&amp;oq=un&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59l2j0i67j35i39j69i60j69i61j69i60l2.839j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)) As mentioned on p.1, Altus is run by executives with deep expertise in structuring complex financial agreements. And Altus\u2019 partnership with Blackstone Credit increases this edge.  \n\nFurther, there are plenty of companies that have achieved significant growth and outperformance despite lacking a technological or consumer brand moat. The most relevant example that jumps to mind is Public Storage (PSA). In the past 20 years, PSA has doubled the S&amp;P 500\u2019s performance \u2013 outpacing the S&amp;P by \\~500%. ([WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/wall-streets-hidden-gem-is-in-public-storage-1455556303)) In the past 10 and 5 years, PSA has outperformed by \\~130% and 60% respectively. This shows the value creation of companies that have exceptional management and execution, especially when such companies are operating in an industry with strong secular growth. There is good reason to believe that Altus is such a company.\n\nDisclaimers: I'm not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice.\n\nDisclosure: I hold 110,000 CBAH warrants.",

        "selftext": "We are officially in October and it is proving to be rather turbulent. Coming off of one of the worst days all year, the major indices did rebound and take back some of the losses. Today is a write up where I go through all the old alerts, push a reset, and create many new ones. \n\nIt was no surprise that we the S&amp;P had its first red month all year last month. The question is will our portfolios keep being drug down by inflation and debt ceiling woes. If you are not already, now is the time to dollar cost average on your long term positions, and pick yourself out some new mid term positions that you think will perform well in the winter months. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n#  First let's take a look at some of my favorites.\n\n**TQQQ** has given up a lot of ground since it's all time high on September 7th. It is now approaching the 180MA, and the RSI is really low. It could be a great time to average into this position. If you prefer options, a bounce of the 180 alerts has been set. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ceb8y1sjqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3611585e424b757718c9dba3f0afefadb634c9a8\n\n **UPRO** is not as bad as **TQQQ**, and that is quite normal according to Trend Spider's seasonality. Usually this time of year, the Nasdaq does worse out of all the indices. Now we see that tech is getting hammered. I'd also DCA into this one.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vh23d1szjqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a31491eb4a487f24f2f872db5e11f32ca41e89e\n\n **UDOW** is probably a great pick up right now for your buy and hold portfolio. It is riding along the 180MA, and if you can get an entry there, start to DCA.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o66oyzrzjqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3dc213a55397d60bda38aba21253948b96b66579\n\n **SOXL** is notorious in our community for money printing swings. I'd say it might have bottomed out of now. There seems to be a 50/50 chance over the past decade that SOXL is up/down in October. Since it is already down, I'd say grab some, and continue to as long as it is going down. Red day buy; green day hold. Let it run until mid November. Hope you are paying attention :D \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j6vay1szjqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=514b94aa0482e335d9bb7f44031b54edef361497\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n#  Crypto \n\n **CRO**, the native Crypto.com token and one of my favorites right now has made a wonderful recovery bounce off of the 180MA. It is now back at 18 cents. Don't sleep on this one. They are now the sponsors of the UFC and the Philadelphia 76ers. I think this is a 10x play. I think the right play here is buy what you can afford: $400, $4000 or $40000. Stake those in their app (for up to 14%apy), since it is a long term play anyways we don't need to use this money. After, you will unlock their metal Visa card. My recommendation is run all your monthly expenses through it and you'll be getting 2-5% back in **CRO** which you continue holding.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wowtpr22kqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6294fca8217fde87067615877a990b4f57565db3\n\n \n\n**BTC** has made a huge recovery this week, and if you are already diversified with BTC exposure congratulate yourself. If not, maybe its time to start considering it. If traditional equity markets are not doing well, money sometimes flows to crypto - and vice versa. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4g8tbdb3kqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1fcc81b846310ed2c490c7dd4498fc90d0cda68\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n#  Alerts \n\n A **WMT** opportunity found by my VIP Discord members. First of all, the seasonality improves a lot in November and the RSI looks way to over sold. I like a bounce off of the the lower support of a paralell channel that it seems to be trading in. This could be a good chance for some EOY calls either now, or wait for bounce.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qztvc4h8kqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=012816a5a8ba2a561beaadecb7a9fee4cc4d3b7a\n\n **XHB**, a homebuilders ETF, LEAPS look ripe for the picking. This would be a long term position with exposure to the US new homes sector, which I don't think will slow down any time soon.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d3sallk9kqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09d918825aedf4ff92ceb2917309b12ba69ccba8\n\n Here is an interesting opportunity for some puts on **CRM** I believe to have found. We are close to all time high, and the seasonality starts to suck going into December. I can't really say the exact point where we buy the puts, but I think maybe around $280. We can even buy vertical spreads for $270/$260 with a December expiration. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kctpebkakqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3d15a26bfe10680a774553e53c78204b3a97a3e\n\n **NKE** has also taken a beating and will probably have decent holiday sales as always. Actually, this alert was already set and expired before it triggered. It is basically riding along the 180MA and the YTD VWAP. Could be a good pick up now, or wait for a confirmation bounce.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nu6sb4jbkqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8f911359729ed6031498e5aae401a786bf2ff98\n\n Same with my **HD** alert. It triggered last week but I was on vacation and missed it. If you bought, you'd be making money. I'll be resetting the alerts for a VWAP bounce and trying again.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tb2uejeckqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=985ad4ea1a62d29579da96945a756cc0da8a614c\n\n I'm still liking these **SPOT** puts as I don't believe in the long term growth of this company. It seems like the resistance drawn out is true and is holding. If continues, there is an opportunity to arb calls and puts between the resistance and glass bottom (yellow). \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hcie2cgdkqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10f8bd58cebd73066512ce8e675a98095ac1cdae\n\n Still continue to play **DIS** on its yoyo like bounce on the glass bottom. Usually **DIS's** seasonality improves in the winter months, especially in November. I still like EOY calls, probably taking profit in November.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2lclpzaekqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=329098a02d6d7b241e153cb149a12cb84693ba8a\n\n It is interesting that this time, when BTC ran, **EBON** didn't. One of my highest conviction plays, I'll wait for the bounce down from the 50MA as usual. **EBON** is a crap company, with crap products, that industry insiders joke about.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ozpj252fkqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3bb701f35e2d14a8945e771a8787425fc8698885\n\n **MCB** is a tricky play, but, like I thought, it is holding resistance. I think its a matter of time before it pulls back. If we see it break the resistance, then I'll cut. Go small here.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vf7usk4gkqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d18e08d1ea0c8c33cbfbf1fc788e3566e3ec7ffb\n\n **SBUX** is around major supports and has somewhat of a nice volume shelf propping it up. Seasonality is good for October and November as cold caffeine addicted shoppers go out and need warm pick-me-uppers. I like calls off of the volume shelf expiring EOY and taking profits possibly in November.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n2lkvt0hkqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bfe6ac15beda08ad064d92c429436c65b943e2f0\n\n Lastly for today, I still like **T** puts off of the 50MA. Another company that I don't believe in long term growth; this is a good opportunity to continue the ride down. I would keep positions small and take profits quick, although it seems that there is more than a 50% chance that month over month is negative.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rpqh90yhkqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0dca69da6cd687c47ad06854a75b9fa5779f1ccd\n\n \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n    Disclaimer: The comments opinions and analysis expressed herein are for informational and educational purpose only and should not be considered as individual advice or recommendations.",
