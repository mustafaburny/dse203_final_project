A group of investors, including Palantir, committed to invest a combined $230 million into the Babylon transaction...\n\n...By participating in the PIPE, or private investment in public equity, Palantir is guaranteed ownership of a certain amount of stock once the transaction closes and the shares in the operating company start trading.\n\nWhile many tech companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) have large venture groups that back start-ups at various stages, Palantir\u2019s focus on SPACs is unique among strategic investors. It means Palantir is betting on more mature companies that are often already valued in the billions of dollars.\"\n\n# PLTR vs Tyler Technologies, Verint, Splunk, and Cognizant\n\n* Cognizant lagging\n* Others in a uptrend\n* Tyler Technologies on a rocket ship.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tzowz5kjbp471.png?width=3254&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84397da7bafffd00d433817e9a36d414e11762fe\n\n# 6/11 Total Flow\n\n* Strong close for PLTR\n* 83.3% bullish\n* 77% call volume\n* 71% ask\n* 96.8% call premium\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wroxdlycdp471.png?width=3450&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f91eb28f61f137066123dc1d13311f8882a826f6\n\n# $26c 7/9 unusual whal alert on 6/10\n\n[Unusual Whale Alert](https://preview.redd.it/957tm5wacp471.png?width=1496&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39c8aec29748f567ff4a2d1a8b7ff5af011bc838)\n\n# Big option trades around alert\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ohjy3tadcp471.png?width=1476&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7d40d8712ee6dedf1d6dddd95cbfc85d7dc4c29\n\n# Six found in the flow - 4 to 2 bullish\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7scyl636cp471.png?width=2678&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=253616663a41c103d2273a3b5a4e45418fa8bbc3\n\n# BarChart Put/Call Ratio\n\nThe Volume numbers reflect options traded during the current session.\n\nPut Volume Total: 68,054\n\nCall Volume Total: 253,701\n\nPut/Call Volume Ratio: 0.27\n\nPut Open Interest Total: 1,064,215\n\nCall Open Interest Total: 2,002,737\n\nPut/Call Open Interest Ratio: 0.5\n\n# TA Notes\n\n* Bullish targets: 26.68 - 29.63 - 32.59\n* Bearish targets: 20.16 - 17.11\n* Support @ 23.02 - 22\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sagyigp8gp471.png?width=3254&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d00e35b8d990a92321459ec330cf0a3ac05e4bd\n\n# 1 Week Timeframe Bullish Bias\n\n* Broke out of downtrend\n* Looking for 27-32 pt\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9krnjzedsp471.png?width=7094&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=196f962f6330834c360267734f03457960b3dc3b\n\n# 1D RSI \n\n* Still has some room to run\n* Above 50 is bullish\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r25s55xxfp471.png?width=3254&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67b21c8deb1f4d5985ac5658bb4abd6cf51af67f\n\n# 3 Day MACD\n\n* Crossover\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ukchtovrsp471.png?width=7094&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f216d3bd264ba7e2b33b89149160fe89acf6bf6\n\n# Positions\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ys9cdwqbtp471.png?width=1226&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6520f89fbd3c3693d99e8749bf6a31a18b54c54d\n\nThanks for reading,\n\n**\ud83c\udf12 The Nightman Charteth \ud83d\udd8d\ufe0f**",

        "selftext": "I am trying to build a strategic Option position (using Interactive Broker) and I want to understand how it works before submitting my order. I understand the mathematics of it, and I want to know the followings:\n\n1- In my Long Butter Fly call (Buy 1 Call at low - Sell 2 Calls at Mid - Buy 1 Call at High) if before expiry, my position goes to loss due to day-to-day volatility, would my broker automatically sell my position, or I can wait until it goes back to profit, until and before my experience date? Is there any variable that I should be cognizant of in order to avoid my broker selling my position?\n\n3- Can I sell the whole butterfly at any time in time, if I find it profitable?the market, but I was wondering if there is any chance, that anybody (or market) would want to exercise that Call that I sold (when the call goes to profit) before expiry so that it makes me cover the position? Or I can keep the butterfly as is, until the expiry date with no concern of market volatility and changes?\n\n3- Can I sell the whole butterfly at anytime in time, if I find it profitable?\n\n4- When I place my butterfly order (all in 1 order), is it possible that one of these positions wouldn't be filled at the time (due to pricing or technicality), and that put me at risk for the calls that I sold? Is there any way to avoid order submission if the broker cannot fill it altogether?",

        "selftext": "Hi guys,\n\nI've created a Regular Bullish MACD divergence scanner based on Dr. Alexander Elder book's, one of my referents when it comes to trading.\n\nIt's not my intention to say this is a \"gold mine\", especially because this scanner is almost impossible to find on the internet. However, I've tested it and I think it gives really nice outputs.\n\nToday, June 19th, after running the scanner for the S&amp;P 500 list, these are the results:\n\nWeekly time frame: CTXS\n\nDaily time frame: ALK\n\n4HR time frame: HD, NKE, DE, PNC, PGR, HPQ, SWK, BBY, MLM, DRI, PHM, WHR, UAA, UA, LEG, VNT\n\nExample for NKE 4 HR time frame:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h2mt6h4bcb671.png?width=2184&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=319acf395be73d06569302ba82d8845d3c6b0505\n\nWhat you guys think ?
