Do we know what they're working on, what their long term goals/plans are? For example, I know that I'm long in AMD because the roadmap for that company is pretty clear for the next few years and I'm confident that the new technology they are working on will be better than their competitors and result in them gaining more of the market share.

        "selftext": "# Stonk Picks For The Week\n\nI posted last Sunday in [r/Options](https://www.reddit.com/r/Options/) my [plays for the week](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/jqlhvn/i_draw_with_crayons_so_you_dont_have_to_made_4k/) and updated the thread Monday morning when I entered the position. Last week I netted about $1,500 on $80,000 or roughly 2%. Not bad considering most stonks ended lower for the week and a few of my positions were looking at risk of being assigned. [The week prior](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jmbuff/i_draw_with_crayons_so_you_dont_have_to_this/) I netted $4k on $75,000 or 5% return.\n\nPlease refrain from any comments such as \"only 1% per week dude you suck\". 1% per week will double your account in about 80 week. So yes that's all I aim for.\n\n**What am I doing?**\n\nI do technical analysis and selling cash-secured-puts 1 to 3 weeks out on stocks that are nearing key levels of support. My goal is to collect premium, but should I get assigned I have absolutely zero problem running the wheel on stocks I want to own. As a backstory I nearly blew up my account doing WSB-style plays in March but have regained all of my account and then some running this strategy since April. What I do now is basically wheeling on weekly puts.\n\nI watch over 200 stocks, I would say its 90% waiting game and 10% true technical analysis. My levels work, but it's normally because I am patiently waiting for an entry point. Yes that's a lot of tickers to watch, but I research my stocks on weekends and then monitor additional plays &amp; levels during the weekday to see if there is an obvious setup I want to participate in.\n\n**Here's a few things regarding my strategy**\n\n**1.** I don't do spreads because if the stock price blows past your long strike and you assume max loss you need a lot of capital to actually be assigned the shares. For that reason I don't really see spreads as a \"Theta Gang\" play and is still very high risk.\n\n**2.** I only sell cash-secured puts with the capability to be assigned if need be. My goal is to never take a loss on a position and always wheel it back to profitability. If something has changed fundamentally with the stock then yes I will close the position and realize the loss.\n\n**3.** If IV on a ticker is very low, then yes I will outright buy shares instead.\n\n**4.** I only aim for 1-4% per week collecting on theta and an occasional earnings theta yolo. No call-buying, no spreads, only put-selling!\n\nHonestly, that's about it. I'll go through some tickers on my watchlist this weekend and what I currently have open.\n\n# Open Positions From Last Week\n\n**BABA**: 1x CSP $260 strike 20 Nov expiration, 1x CSP $245 strike Nov 20 expiration.\n\nI opened the $260 strike put last week when the stock dipped, then opened the $245 strike put on Friday after the stock dipped for a second time. The $260 was down about 25% when I opened the $245 and I saw it as free money to get me back to at very minimum break-even on this particular ticker by this upcoming Friday the 20th. These 2 CSPs are taking up a fuckload of my buying power, so I will need to close them if I want to open up additional positions because I don't like being over-leveraged. If BABA gets a pop on Monday, I'll close out one or both and free up some capital if I want to enter new positions.\n\n# Chart Rules\n\n**Pink Lines** = Trading range &amp; channel. I find stocks typically trade within certain channels until an event, such as earnings or some news which changes the fundamentals of the stock price changes the trend and a new channel is formed.\n\n**Blue Lines** = Key areas of support/resistance. I don't like focusing on supp/res levels every $2 down like some people do. I look at the bigger picture and find where where key levels of buyers come in to grab the stock. I'll try to sell puts there.\n\n# Master Plays This Week\n\n**LULU - 4 week earnings run-up play**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1li7lsn4yhz51.png?width=2430&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a52ab2615fbdc745084ff5eecfc0c3de87a55ce\n\nLULU has been trading in the same range for the last 5 months unable to hold the break-out, but not falling below support either. I'm feeling comfortable owning this stock around $310 range and expecting a potential run-up into earnings set to report mid December. I will look to sell Dec 18 puts to collect on earnings IV and see a potentially pump in the next few weeks. These will be about 4-5 weeks out, so I'll even sell closer to an at-the-money strike and hopefully find a good return. LULU IV isn't the best and the stock price will require a lot of buying power so I will keep an eye on some opportunities this week instead of jumping right into the play Monday AM.\n\n**Positions I'm looking at**:\n\nDec 18 $300 strike put for $9.50 or $950 in premium, 3.17% return in 5 weeks\n\n**OR**\n\nDec 18 $310 strike put for $12.50 or $1,250 in premium, 4.0% return in 5 weeks\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**DOCU - Earnings December 3rd**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/py6frev5yhz51.png?width=2434&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b547e7f2b24e661e5e1e1b069b4a915344faad7f\n\nI made some money on DOCU 2 weeks ago. Last week stock price was crushed by vaccine news which turned out to be nothing but fluff. We can see DOCU is once again trading at the lower range of the trend/channel (pink lines). The trend is still up, but the stock price has been highly volatile failing each break-out and returning into the channel. I like selling $195 or even $200 strike puts if I can. All depends how we open Monday. DOCU is set to report earnings December 3rd.\n\n**Positions I'm looking at:**\n\nDec 4 $200 strike put for $11.00 or $1,100 premium, a return of 5.5% in 3 weeks\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**AMD - A spin-off from NVDA earnings.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z39ri90cyhz51.png?width=2304&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43185021db634a624327cadaae0792e097e98b83\n\nI made some good money selling puts on AMD back in June/July when the stock was trading completely flat for 2 months. The price action from May-August is very similar to what it's doing now, just at lower stock price back then. Looks like it's been in a similar range for the last few weeks. NVDA options are quite expensive, so I'll be using AMD as a proxy and playing that. Looking at the fancy crayola support/resistance lines I drew I think there will be buyers if we get down to $78 or $74. I'm comfortable **HODL**ing AMD at those levels and run the wheel if I need to. In my opinion, we can see a bullish bounce from NVDA earnings. If you have the capital and want to sell against NVDA I think there is a similar play that can be found there.\n\n**Positions:**\n\nAMD Nov 27 $78 strike puts for $1.10, a return of 1.4% in 2 weeks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TDOC - TELEDOC**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nr8v2rbdyhz51.png?width=2300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5d4f41ae7c40013b0a00df854479fca014b6577\n\nTDOC is a newly added ticker to my watchlist and I think will have good potential in the future. You might be seeing me enter this trade quite a few times in the next weeks. The TDOC chart has been highly volatile recently. I wouldn't say technicals don't matter, but it's quite possible this stock just blows past any support/resistance with ease. The stock has had a pretty good dip in last week's trading sessions and trading down 30% from the August highs. I'm comfortable selling the $175 strike put and owning the stock at that price if it continues to dip.\n\n**Positions:**\n\nNov 27 $175 put for $4.30, or 2.5% return in 2 weeks.\n\nA lot depends how we open Monday, if market has a melt-up we simply wait until entry points become favorable to us. That might not be until later in the week, but patience is always key in the stonk market. If we open down then we can sell the positions mentioned at 1 or 2 strikes lower for the same premium, that's a win-win. Don't forget we have a monthly options expiration this week and it could be volatile.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope y'all had a good weekend, **lets get this bread**.\n\n**10am UPDATE:**\n\nClosed 1 of my BABA CSP's for a 15% gain, will let the other ride to expiration or close at 90% to free up capital if I want another play.\n\nAt the market open everything was moving fast. Wish I got in when everything was pretty red, but it climbed quick shortly after open. Entered only 2 positions so far, AMD + TDOC, I think I will add DOCU in there as well. I'm still liking most plays on my list, but going to sit tight for now. Lots of opportunities out there. Good luck all! Will post another update \n\n**Positions**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7zcicbkdamz51.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df7ebc4702398c8337b485acbffd9caf78e196c9",

        "selftext": "Ok so my first official DD but I\u2019ve got some conviction around it so I thought I\u2019d get the beautiful masses to opine\n\nMy thesis is MRVL is undervalued and primed for a earnings, EOY and 2021 run. Four main points:\n\n1. The whole chip sector is exploding between the tech wave, 5g, cloud, etc (and even the beloved palantir needing chips as they grow like crazy). And MRVL is focused on 5g and cloud infrastructure specifically and kickin ass in these markets\n\n2. Within this sector, MRVL is a value play at 20x PE. That\u2019s compared to a company like Nvidia at 85 and AMD at 120! But they all 3 have comparable gross profit margins. This means that as things keep looking up this offers bigger growth potential than the big players\n\n3. MRVL price has been depressed because they made a huge acquisition in October of INPHI. This gives them huge further growth potential into their strengths of 5g and cloud.  And this merger is virtually guaranteed not at some level questionable like the ARM-NVDA deal. \n\nAND this makes them a great acquisition target for a big player cuz they have a ton of assets at a lowish price. \n\nHere\u2019s the MRVL CEO talking about the acquisition:\nMarvell Tech CEO on acquiring data center company Inphi, 5G growth\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/10/29/marvell-tech-ceo-on-acquiring-data-center-company-inphi-5g-growth.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.Message\n\n4. MRVL has huge institutional ownership (at 89%!) so if we do start to get some price movement the float is small enough that we could see a 10-20% move in share price fast as retail fomos in. Especially in the event of an acquisition.  Also this should reinforce that smart money sees this as a great play. \n\n\nWith earnings coming up on 12/3 I think we see a modest run into it and then a pop on earnings. Yes I said it a pop! Not a pull back like most other tech because this is the first time we hear all the details of this acquisition and it\u2019s potential huge value that MRVL hasn\u2019t run on. \n\nI\u2019m taking a short and long term position for lower risk. If we do get a good earnings run up I\u2019ll flip my short term calls into shares for the long term. \n\n100 12/11 46c\n50 1/21/22 50c \n\nTLDR: buy MRVL. You\u2019ll thank me later\n\n\nSide note: I\u2019m a big fan of the strategy of buying leaps then selling super otm weeklies against them and buying shares with that money to build a position for free essentially with the leaps as long term leverage. This is my plan for my MRVL leaps once earnings passes. This strategy has been working out for me on SPY but I\u2019d love to hear peoples thoughts on any pitfalls they see.",

My crayons attempt to analyze all likely possibilities. Think of this analysis as a butterfly chart, allowing guidance over a variety of scenarios. Think of this analysis as entering and exit points.\n\n**11/26 SPY Recap**\n\nSPY must have overeaten during Thanksgiving because it was sluggish on Friday (11/26). SPY fell out of its uptrend channel around 9:30 AM ish MST and dipped to its low point of the day, 362.58, before quickly rebounding. SPY reached a high of 364.18 and closed at 363.67.\n\n[15m chart](https://preview.redd.it/e4ge9fwnl7261.png?width=2172&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ab5da8a655f9f863a015293dfd4a043fcf29111)\n\nSPY has been consolidating since 11/24 midday. It is currently at the top of its consolidation rectangle, as highlighted below. We shall see if SPY can break out on Monday or if it will bounce off resistance and head back down to 361 ish and below. We could have one more day of consolidation, based on past charting.\n\n[30m chart](https://preview.redd.it/k1dct1fyl7261.png?width=2226&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=868e9285d8a2b311db1ac386cda29c6b363b9939)\n\nFrom 11/25 Recap: \u201cSPY consolidated from 11/9 - 11/13 before breaking out 1.5%. She consolidated for about 2 days and 9 hours, from 11/13 - 11/17 (over the weekend). However, after consolidating, SPY fell about 1.14%. After the fall, SPY consolidated for about 5 days and 17 hours from 11/18 - 11/24 (over the weekend). Spy jumped about 1.46% before the current consolidation channel.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday will be the start of SPY\u2019s 4th day of consolidation, so something has to give IMO, but she could consolidate on Monday, so watch out for pump fakes. You may want to extend the consolidation channel to be safe. However, if SPY breaks out, expect a 1-2% movement in either direction, as highlighted below.\n\n[30m chart](https://preview.redd.it/020y89jnm7261.png?width=2170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d438b4dfe8d9db618a865fea7f284fef6bc5ab3b)\n\nAs stated in an earlier analysis, I'm bullish on SPY if it stays above 358 ish. SPY continues to toy around with a w-shaped recovery as highlighted below. On the daily chart, I'm looking for PSY to break through resistance and find new support. If support looks healthy, you could sell your wife's wedding ring and look at a late Dec. 380c. lotto.\n\n[1d chart](https://preview.redd.it/7epbtq32n7261.png?width=2106&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09c6775f740717f7413f7a6a515c75bc6b7e45d1)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*EASY MODE ACTIVATED\\*\\*\\*\\* or Merry Christmas You filthy Animal\n\n**11/30 - 12/28 AMD Possibilities or Is AMD on Santa\u2019s Nice List?**\n\n* If AMD punches through 87.18 resistance finds and news support, you could look at a 90c exp. 12/11 and hope that it hits between 90-93.2+ and trim.

Barbara Comstock (VA-10)**\n\nComstock lost her 2018 re-election bid and I don't necessarily think she is a WSBer (she doesn't trade nearly as many meme stocks as the other guys on this list) but I do blame her for turning off the ATM that was 2016-2018 $MU.\n\nShe bought \\~$75,000 worth of Micron Technology stock on 6/25/18, just days before the first stretch in years when the stock wasn't literally printing money. MU lost half its value in the next 6 months, and still hasn't recovered to the price she purchased it at.\n\n---\n\n**#5. Rep. Alan Lowenthal (CA-47)**\n\n***Favorite meme stocks: SPCE, GLD***\n\nLowenthal is actually one of the more successful traders on this list, having gotten in to $GLD in September of 2019. He also timed his exit from $SPCE pretty well, selling about half of his position right at the mid-February peak.\n\nIf I had to guess, I'd say Lownethal just lurks the sub looking for opportunities to inverse WSB.\n\n---\n\n**#4. Rep. Josh Gottheimer (NJ-5)**\n\n***Favorite meme stocks: SNAP, TSLA, GE, NVDA, LULU, AMD***\n\nThe Josh Gottheimer story is a story of perseverance and diamond hands. I'm pretty sure this guy read some DD on here that said SNAP was going to moon after its IPO, because he bought into the stock just days after it went public. He caught the falling knife right on its tip as his position lost 75% of its value over the next couple years. A less man would have cut the loss, but Gottheimer just kept buying up more $SNAP even as it was losing him money. Those of you who have an eye on the markets (perhaps a minority) will know that his grit and determination was rewarded handsomely in the last couple months.\n\n---\n\n**#3. Sen. Pat Roberts (Kansas)**\n\n***Favorite meme stocks: TSLA, GLD, BYND, NVDA, GE***\n\nPat Roberts is another guy that I think just comes here to inverse the sub. Roberts made an impeccably well-timed TSLA play a few months ago when he bought in on August 3rd, just a few days before the August run-up began and then sold on September 1st, just before the early September drop.\n\nInsider trading or inversing WSB? You decide.\n\nWSB must be big in Kansas, because the next guy up is the fellow who was just elected to fill the vacancy being left by Roberts upcoming departure from the senate.\n\n---\n\n**#2. Rep. Roger Marshall (KS-1)**\n\n***Favorite meme stocks: JNUG, TSLA, SNAP, MU, ROKU, AMD, NVDA, LULU***\n\nMarshall got a big promotion to the Senate a few days ago, and if that didn't work out he probably would have switched to day-trading full time. He was already day-trading JNUG within a few months of entering office, buying and then selling thousands of dollars worth of the stock between market open and close.\n\nWhat Marshall really lacks is patience, as he recently entered then prematurely exited a position in ROKU in mid-September, missing out on big gains in the weeks to follow.\n\n---\n\n**#1 Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (Rhode Island)**\n\n***Favorite meme stocks: GME, TSLA, GE, NVDA***\n\nThe story of Sheldon Whitehouse is not a happy story, but it's a story that some of you might be told of many a member of this community. He had the right ideas, but just did not have strong enough hands to see them through.\n\nOn July 28, 2017, Whitehouse entered a position in $TSLA. Seeing a modest 3% gain through the month of August, he doubled down on his position on August 24th, 2017.\n\nAlthough he soon began to lose money as $TSLA sank, in Elon he still trusted, and he bought more $TSLA yet again in December of 2018.\n\nSadly for Whitehouse, we now reach the heartbreaking part of the story. Seeing a 30% loss on the investments into TSLA he'd been making over the last 2 years, Whitehouse lost faith and sold the entirety of the position on August 27th, 2019.\n\nAfter holding TSLA for over 2 years at a loss, he sold within weeks of what would become a yearlong, nearly 1000% run-up.",

        "selftext": " \n\nWe all know SPY at ATHs, Dow 30k, PLTR is fucking moving, EV insanity blah blah blah. But I just know there is some bleary eyed idiot from Stocks and Investing here that is like I just CANT bring myself to take these kind of risks, look how expensive the market is!!!\n\nEven though the market is at all time highs, and basically the market has been trading flat other than yesterday, there is crazy volatility underneath the surface. For almost a decade, growth stocks (high top line growth, high multiples, etc) have outperformed value because 1) growth was hard to find as the economy was dog shit 2) interest rates dropped like a stone from 4 down to 1.4% pre-covid which makes cash flows in the out year more valuable today when you discount them back 3) usually high period of disruption due to technology (connectivity, shift to mobile, computing increases, etc). **But basically, when growth is hard to find, you are willing to pay the fuck up for future earnings growth.**\n\nBut boys. Let me tell ya, economic growth is coming the fuck back. One, the Fed goes fucking brrr - and ole Yellen is back in the saddle.1) The Fed is basically a permeant backstop now which basically changes the equation of risk for both investors and companies. 2) The Dems will, and should, print money with reckless abandon. Because the US dollar is the global reserve currency they should print dough until the dollar fucking breaks. And it basically hasn't budged even though the US has spent 7 trilly on Stimulus. 3) Savings rates in both the US and Canada are at all time highs, with interest rates at all time lows. Have you seen the fucking housing market? Not only is there lots of money on the sidelines, **demand is coming online in sync across the globe.** You may never see a demand spike like you are about to see in areas like Leisure / Travel. Hotels in Honolulu aren't going from 150$/night back to $400 next year. Mother fucker they are going to 600. Every live sporting event, concert, festival, restaurant will be fucking PACKED. **4)** The fed changed their inflation policy from 2%, to an average metric - basically meaning they will run the economy hot to bring average inflation up to 2-2.5% over an observed time period. Well inflation has been sub 1.5% for YEARS and they will run this fucker HOT at 5-6% GDP before they touch rates. **Most important thing here is that rates are going up on the ten year, there will be unreal demand for things most affected by the virus, and the relative valuation of low pe stocks is going to start looking reallll good realll fast.**\n\nSo what does this mean? You want to be in early cycle cyclicals right now. Industrials, Materials, Banks. You also wanna be in travel/restaurants. Energy will rock too, but its kind of dog shit and you can leave it be.\n\nCurve ball though - I'm one of those blind ass tech bulls. I'm not here to tell you that GM is better than TSLA, they aren't. But when you can pay 15x for 100% EPS growth from GM you're going to do that instead of paying 300x for the same rate at Tesla. Same thing with software. I jerk off that business model and the trap door isn't going to fall out, its just not going to do fucking well on a relative basis.\n\nI don't wanna sell my tech shit, but I wanna participate in this reopening lunacy. So how do I do it? Buy shit thats going to do well if some government shut the place down. I'm talking DOCU, PTON, ZM, COUP, OKTA, I dunno, whatever software you want. But balance this shit with long dated calls in reopening stuff. If your calls expiry worthless, your tech shit will be up so much you won't care. If tech is flat to down you'll mint on the calls. I control 16x in shares vs my outlay for the calls, basically the size of the rest of my portfolio in Reopening calls June 21-Jan 22. Sharpe ratio (return/vol) for the last two months is 5.2. Psychologically, the lockdown headlines just aren't doing it anymore. LA, NYC, Chicago, France, Germany, Canada, all locked down, market it looking through it. AZN puts out a garbage vaccine release and value is smoking hot. You'll see more catalysts as these places reopen, first innoculations are announced, general availability, etc. AND cases will start to seasonally decline around March when it gets warmer out. And if you don't think this shit is seasonal, you're dumb. You think we just found the magic in July? Shut up.\n\nLong WFH - AMD, PLTR, ZM, PTON, DOCU, SQ\n\nLong Reopening Calls - AMC, XLF, KRE, XLE, LYFT, JETS",

Company\u2019s products are beloved by all the losers in your life (i.e. your loser childhood friend who works at McDonald\u2019s and spends all their paycheck towards RH YOLO trades, weed, and video games).\n\nThis is the number one seller of high-performance computer memory, cases, power supplies, coolers and gaming keyboards as well as #2 in performance controllers and streaming gear. Per Andy Paul (CEO) in their most recent earnings call, he reported that most of their product lines maintain a top 3 US market share positions, with several number one positions according to data from NPD group.\n\n\n**So what? Why should I care?**\n\nListen you retard. When there\u2019s unexpected nudity during that HBO show that you watch on Sunday night, you say thank you. You don\u2019t stop and ask, \u201cMan, I thought this show was rated PG. Why is there nudity?\u201d Similarly, when someone tells you about a promising stock that is going to double, triple, and quadruple from the current price point, you fucking listen and continue to read the wisdom documented in this long ass fucking post.\n\nCorsair generates their revenue from two segments.\n\nSegment 1: Gamer/Creator Peripherals.\n\nFor you retards who can\u2019t understand big words like peripherals, this segment includes gaming keyboards, mice, controllers, headsets and other streaming equipment such as capture cards and microphones. And I am not talking about $10 mice or $20 keyboards that your broke ass buy at Staples. These are high margin, high end, top of the line gaming/computer peripherals used by those talent-less hacks streaming live on Twitch, YouTube, OnlyFans, etc for \u201cdonations\u201d. Today, 71% of millennial gamers in the US watch gaming video content on streaming platforms for an average of almost 6 hours per week. There are over 6 million committed streamers in the world today who viewed over 12 billion streaming hours in 2019 alone.\n\nThe revenue in this segment spiked 129% YOY in the most recent quarter to $161.1 million. It made up for 35% of CRSR\u2019s total revenue. This is high fucking margin business, which means Corsair is a winner that rips off those losers mentioned above. Their gross margin was 37.1% in the most recent quarter.\n\nSegment 2: Gaming Components and Systems.\n\nThis segment includes sales of equipment such as computer cases, RAM, cooling solutions, power supply units and pre-built gaming PCs. You know those losers with a big ass gaming desktop PCs with \ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc3b LED lights around the case? Those \ud83e\udd21 s spend shit load of money on these gaming systems because it makes them feel important when they play video games with other losers. The gross margin for this segment is 28%. Not too shabby.\n\nIn the most recent filing, their total revenue increased 60.7% YOY to $457.1 million and the gross margin jumped significantly. Adjusted operating income increased 194% to $61.4 mil.\n\n**Ok. So they rocked this quarter. But what about their future? What is their outlook?**\n\nWell you ungrateful greedy f*ck, CRSR is well positioned to benefit from long term growth trends in the gaming hardware market, making it an ideal play for retards like you who can only ask questions like, \u201cPS5 or the new XBOX? SNE or MSFT?\u201d. No you retard. Those stocks are not gaming pure plays, and they are not fucking cheap. Your broke ass can\u2019t afford them. \n\nCRSR can rely on the gamer and creator peripherals business to drive sustained growth in the future. Why? Because of the fast growing e-sports market. According to some smart ass industry experts, they estimate that the global e-sports market could clock a compound annual growth rate of over 24% thru 2027. That means, the demand for video game streaming equipment and other peripherals is expected to increase in the coming years, adding $2.8 billion worth of incremental revenue over the next four years in this market alone.\n\nCRSR reportedly has 18.3% of the peripherals market today and controls 41.9% of the PC components market. The entire PC gaming hardware market is expected to add $3.6 billion in incremental revenue this year, thanks to all the losers playing games at home due to COVID. The total market size for PC gaming hardware market today is $40 billion, of which 83% was spending from competitive and committed gamers. These are true retards who will spend between $1,000 to over $1,800 on gaming hardware and accessories. \n\n**But the stock ran up quite a bit. Should I wait will it drops?**\n\nThe stock is still cheap. Their POS (Price to Sales) ratio is 1.91. In comparison, Logitech\u2019s POS is at 4.3. Additionally, CRSR is currently priced at 80x trailing earnings and has a forward P/E ratio of 26. Both are favorable compared to their peers.\n\nBecause of COVID, upcoming holidays and other factors/trends that are favorable to Corsair (i.e. anticipated next generation gaming hardware/GPU to be launched by NVDA and AMD), CRSR is expected to generate full year revenue of $1.6 billion this year (which is 45% increase YOY)\n\n- Second Wave COVID: Will force consumers to stay at home and people will need other activities apart from binging Netflix.\n\n- Holiday Retail Sales Outlook is still positive. Gaming products will be boosted by Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Christmas shopping.\n\n- People are upgrading their home PCs. As more people stay at home or work from home, more attention is being paid to the home PC and people are spending $ on upgrades.\n\nThey focus heavily on the higher end of the market, with product focus on performance and innovation. With gaming growing rapidly and big money flowing into this market, demand for performance is increasing. CRSR\u2019s products meet the expectation of what the gamers want (i.e. speed, precision, reliability, great processing power, etc)\n\nAlthough the competitive and committed gamers accounted for 83% of the $40 billion spend in the global market for PC and streaming gears in 2019, that only accounts for 18% of the worldwide total of 524 million PC gamers in 2019 with the remaining being casual gamers, who do not often rely on specialized high end gears yet. (Translation,there is untapped market of 82% among the 524 million PC gamers who have yet discovered the beauty of high end gaming stuff)\n\nIf the average spend of this group of gamers were to significantly move up going forward, then the market will also grow by multiples (for high end gaming stuff). \n\nThis stock is currently undervalued compared to its peers like Logitech and Razor. Not only that, the current P/E ratio of CRSR is roughly 3% below the overall P/E of NASDAQ. Additionally, looking at POS (Price to Sales) and MCS (Market Cap to Sales), CRSR is cheap by discount of 57% and 45% respectively to the NASDAQ. Sales are expected to grow next year by more than 30%.\n\n**Risks**\n\nF*ck risks. F*ck that mindset. This company is already profitable and prints money. If you retards can blindly throw money at losers like GME and NKLA, you can throw money at a company with actual sales, actual products and actual profits.\n\n**Price Target**\n\n$40+ per share by May 2021. You can play the call option or you can just buy the stock.\nEither way, it will get to $40 range and above once this stock\u2019s valuation catches up with the rest of the market. By end of 2021, I expect this stock to be $70-80. Oh, and for you retards who are risk averse, this stock is considered \u201cStay at Home\u201d stocks. It will moon during the pandemic, and it will moon after the pandemic.",

        "selftext": "Apple last week released the following new Macs.\n\n\\- MacBook Air\n\n\\- MacBook Pro 13 inch\n\n\\- Mac mini\n\nThese 3 Macs all share same chip, [Apple M1](https://www.apple.com/mac/m1/). So Apple is no longer putting Intel CPU in their new Mac product lines.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo you might wonder, how good is this chip?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBased on the leak (and official ones will be released in 2 days when people start receiving their macs), it appears that the new MacBook **Air** destroys the last year's top of the line MacBook **Pro** 16 inch's performance in benchmark, according to what is listed on Geekbench. It also means that Mac mini, which costs ($699) stumps all previous MBP's performances.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n||[2020 MacBook Air ($999)](https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/macbook-air-late-2020) , 2020 Mac mini ($699), 2020 MacBook Pro 13inch ($1299)|[2019 Macbook Pro 16inch &amp; CPU upgraded ($2999)](https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/macbook-pro-16-inch-late-2019)|[2019 MacBook Air ($999)](https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/macbook-air-early-2020-intel-core-i7-1060ng7-1-2-ghz-4-cores)|[i7-9700k](https://browser.geekbench.com/processors/intel-core-i7-9700k)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Single-core Score (Geekbench5)|**1717**|1095|1138|1289|\n|Multi-core Score (Geekbench5)|**7380**|6869|3072|7267|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI see that this leap in performance is far greater than what AMD did when they first announced their Ryzen1,2,3 product lines in past few years, and I dare to say that we might be observing start of new era where Apple silicon for laptop computer will be dominating over Intel/AMD going forward for next few years, similar to how their *A* series silicon in iPhone started dominating over all other mobile chips in smartphones, and the gap has not been closing.\n\nThe new M1 chip's single core score of 1717 [outshines](https://browser.geekbench.com/processor-benchmarks) all of consumer level CPUs, and its multicore performance is similar to that of i7-9700k. You need to understand that TDP difference between these M1 and i7-9700k chips are huge. M1 runs with 10watt\\~20watt TDP while i7-9700k has 95watt TDP .\n\nIn short, laptop processor M1 is doing much work with much less energy (less heat) than i7-9700k, which is a desktop processor, and that is how Apple was able to release new MacBook Air this year without any cooling fans. You can't imagine running Intel i7 cpu without cooling fan. This just shows tech level differences and how much Apple was able to achieve by spending on research with billions in their cash reserve.\n\nThe M1 chip, without need of any separate graphic card offers GPU performance similar to RX 570 or GTX 1060. The intel's counterpart onboard graphic chip, Intel UHD630, has much worse GPU performance than M1, and they are incomparable.\n\nApple will be working on improved version of M1 chip, (possibly known as M1X), so that they can put them into MacBook Pro 16inch product lines, and higher end version of Mac mini, and I foresee that to be much faster than any other laptop CPUs out in the wild today, and on par with high end desktop processors.\n\nOf course, the shift in momentum in userbase or AAPL's stock price won't happen in a single day or in single month, just like how release of the first iPhone or Apple's first SoC A4 (which were great innovations at the time but were incomprehensible for many fund managers, as well as to Warren Buffet) at that time of release didn't pop AAPL's stock price 10x times in one day or one month.\n\nHowever, I think AAPL will be gradually increase market share in laptop computer markets over time, and also be able to make more profits due to simpler logistic (They now only need to produce/maintain one M1 line compared to having to embed 11 different intel chips, and having to work with Intel), and possibly expand their influence over to the desktop computer as well in the future.\n\nTL DR:\n\n\\- Apple M1 chip dominates.\n\n\\- Buy $AAPL stocks in your IRA/401k.\n\n\\- Buy $AAPL LEAP call options 2022-09-16 at $120 strike price, and don't look back.",

        "selftext": "Don't think I've seen too many discussions on here about Apple's new M1 based Macs - maybe i missed them when the M1 was first released.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTech reviewers are unanimously orgasming and drooling over this new ARM based Apple-designed chip because it fucking destroys Intel/AMD chips in both performance, efficiency and cost.\n\nSeriously, as a life long PC Gamer + MacBook Pro user, the stats on these new chips are amazing and I'm genuinely concerned about Intel's future in the consumer segment. How will beefier desktop versions of these chips perform with superior cooling. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe M1 chips are first generation, 'low-end' chipsets which are the first offerings from Apple for it's Mac. I think we will be blown away once again once they release their 'pro' chips for higher end machines (MBP high end, Mac Pro, iMac, etc).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCould licensing this chip technology and design out to PC manufacturers in the future be a viable new vertical for Apple (would this make sense for them to do? It's a solid XX-XXX digit $Billion TAM) Most other PCs can't fully utilize ARM chips because Windows is a POS. Apple is in the unique position to control every aspect of product design so it make sense that they've been able to come out with a laptop generation which is the largest leap in price/performance in recent history.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust some anecdotal tweets I read\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/56g6n19tzb061.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1cf4e0f6d0e794ce9e1c800a31ad5987e87b1d26\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gvnhc9gv0c061.png?width=596&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7bd74f8ec1da9a72a0813c9ddcef121213ec67f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ln7u0mpa1c061.png?width=619&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=465d7fa8926293c426ad533a00dce0a0caf21baa\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSeriously wtf, this chip out performs the top spec Intel chip from last year in REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS to an insane degree. When a sub $1400 M1 MacBook Air can run laps around a $6000 2019 16inch Intel MacBook Pro, you know Intel is truly fucked.\n\nNow in terms of $AAPL, obviously this hasn't affected the stock at all because Macs are now such a small % of their business. I think that the Mac/iPad segment is going to start to see growth once again when the true potential of the new chipset is realized and discovered by the market. Potentially they can start selling these chips to OEMs in a few years time? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso where are all the Windows peasants who spam comments about how Apple hardware is overpriced and doesn't perform as well as similarly priced Windows machines.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLinks:\n\n[https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition](https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition)\n\n[https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review](https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review)\n\n[https://www.anandtech.com/tag/apple-m1](https://www.anandtech.com/tag/apple-m1)\n\n[https://9to5mac.com/2020/11/11/macbook-air-with-m1-chip-beats-16-inch-macbook-pro-performance-in-benchmark-test/](https://9to5mac.com/2020/11/11/macbook-air-with-m1-chip-beats-16-inch-macbook-pro-performance-in-benchmark-test/)\n\n[https://twitter.com/twostraws/status/1328704598962565122](https://twitter.com/twostraws/status/1328704598962565122)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions: long AF AAPL for life, INTEL AMD NVIDIA WATCHOUT",

        "selftext": "**TLDR:**\n\nIn one sentence a TML is an institutional quality stock in a leading industry group with superior fundamentals and technicals. These are monster stocks which over the course of weeks and months increase +100% to +5,000% . These stocks are disruptors which change how we work, live, or play.\n\nTMLs are popular with traders/investors whose methodology is based on the CANSLIM system developed by William O'Neil. He called them Model Book Stocks. Huge winners worth studying to identify common characteristics that they all share  O'Neil studied over 1000 model book stocks going back to the 1880s. Many are shown and discussed in these must read books\n\n* How To Make Money in Stocks, William O'Neil\n*  Monster Stocks: How They Set Up, Run Up, Top and Make You Money , John Boik\n* The Lifecycle Trade: How to Win at Trading IPOs and Super Growth Stocks, Eric Krull, Kathy Donnelly, and Kurt Dail \n\n**A few Historical Examples** from William O'Neil's How To Find &amp; Own America's Greatest Opportunities\n\nApple 2003  [https://imgur.com/2Egn9z5](https://imgur.com/2Egn9z5)\n\nNetflix 2009 [https://imgur.com/BHCtJpo](https://imgur.com/BHCtJpo)\n\nHome Depot 1982 [https://imgur.com/tBU3JgU](https://imgur.com/tBU3JgU)\n\nQualcomm 1997 [https://imgur.com/oYPItOW](https://imgur.com/oYPItOW)\n\nYahoo 1996 [https://imgur.com/ToOxnQJ](https://imgur.com/ToOxnQJ)\n\n**So what are the Fundamental characteristics of a TML? You want to see superior:**\n\n* Quarterly Sales Growth &gt; 25% YoY\n* Quarterly Earnings Growth &gt; 25% YoY\n* Pre+After Tax Margins &gt;20% Recent Quarters\n* ROE &gt;17%\n* Annual Earnings Ests for the next year &gt; 25%\n\nAnd above all else you want the stock to have a great story- A new and innovative product or service  that changes how we work live or play. Not every TML will have all of these criteria, but in general their record should be outstanding with regards to most of them. The higher these values the better. Earnings and Sales growth over 100% YoY is ideal. Annual Estimates for next year over 100% would be exceptional.\n\nTMLs are also often in the Top 20 Industry groups at the times of their runs. The TML is the leader of an overall top group which is riding the tailwinds of changing environments. Recent examples $SE $SHOP $AMZN Retail-Internet and $TSLA $NIO Electric Vehicles (Auto Manufacturers)\n\nAdditionally base liquidity is required for these stocks to be institutional quality. Dollar Volume &gt; $30 Million is essential and most should have DV much higher than that. Accumulation by big hedge funds and mutual funds like Fidelity Contrafund are what move the markets. They won't touch a promising stock unless it has liquidity.\n\n**Now for Technical (Price Action) Characteristics of TMLs.**\n\nThey should be:\n\n* Above a Rising 30 Week Moving Average\n* Breaking out of a Stage 1 or Stage 2 Base\n* Trending above Key Moving Averages (10, 21ema, 50sma)\n* Volume and Price contractions within bases\n* Up/Down Vol&gt; 1.2\n* Huge gaps up on volume after Earning Beat\n* And most importantly they must be showing Relative Strength, meaning they are outperforming the vast majority of stocks in the market. This. is. vital.\n\nDuring corrections and overall market weakness they should be near all time highs, above their longer term moving averages.  They should be standing out like a sore thumb and yelling \"Buy me\".  And during Market Uptrends they should be trending above the shorter term moving averages, forming sideways price shelfs during small pullbacks and then breaking out again. Most stay above their 50 SMAs and even 21 emas for extended periods of time.\n\n**So how to scan for them:**\n\nUse MarketSmith, the IBD Stock Screener, Finviz, or another screener and screen for the fundamental criteria mentioned above combined with the stock over the 200+50 SMA.  It's helpful to have multiple screens splitting up the criteria for instance one scan for the earnings and one for sales.\n\nHere is an example Finviz TML Scan: [https://imgur.com/a/CzwHdM8](https://imgur.com/a/CzwHdM8)\n\n**Recent examples to study**\n\n$LVGO 2020  \n$TSLA 2019-2020  \n$DOCU 2019-2020  \n$PTON 2020  \n$SHOP 2016-2020  \n$AMD 2018  \n$ZM 2020",

        "selftext": "Beginner options trader here and have being doing a lot of research via Youtube and this subreddit.  Took my time trying to educate myself on the basics and came to the conclusion that a CSP and the wheel strategy is something I wanted to pursue and learn more about.\n\nI have 30k in my RH account and decided to get my feet wet. I followed the general guide of roughly -0.30 Delta with a 70% of profit.  So this is what I did.\n\n\\- AMD DEC18 $75 PUT @ $1.25.  Stock was trading at $84 when I did the CSP on Monday 11/9.  This is a stock I don't mind owning.\n\n\\- The next day, stock price dropped to about $78 that same option was now approx $3.50 but as of now has come back to approx $1.80.  I understand that the closer it is to being ITM then the option cost increases.\n\nI feel like locking up $7500 for $125 on Dec 18 prob wasn't worth it?  I don't mind being assigned b/c I would just turn around and do a CC with the potential for capital gains.  My question is this:\n\nI have a few questions I was hoping I could get some advice on.\n\n1. **Should I sell puts on a weekly basis instead with it being closer to the stock price for a higher premium?**  The idea being, I get the premium with a higher chance of being assigned, then turn around  and do a CC not to far above for a higher premium again.  The CC is then either exercised or ends or I buy to close on Friday.  Rinse and repeat.\n2. **Is it wise selling more than one put for the same stock?  Meaning, I could sell 2 to 3 puts of AMD**\n\nI'm not confident with rolling yet and I'm doing some more research as it's still going over my head a bit.  I don't want to risk doing it until I have a complete understanding of it.\n\nI hope I've explained myself enough where the above doesn't sound like a crazy person.",

        "selftext": "Listen up bitches.  I was bored pondering my thoughts and my wittle autistic brain started running wild.  It got me thinking.  AMD currently has a market cap of 90 bill and assuming they continue to dominate then they will most certainly replace Intel who has a market cap of double round 186.  Assuming this I concur AMD will be roughly the same size as Intel in 5 years and be double what it is now giving it a stock price around 160.  However assuming they continue to innovate they will sport a higher pe ratio.  Intel has a pe of 10 while AMD currently holds at 100.  Lets be bearish and assume AMD trades at a pe of 50 in 5 years.  Given that multiple of 5 lets multiply that by 160 and bam!  I have a price target of 800 for AMD by 2025.  Does this math even make sense or am I just retarded?",

        "selftext": "(((I wanted to post this yesterday, which is the best day to buy, but forgot about it. Still is a very good option to buy if you ever see a dip (doubt it))))\n\nHello wsber, how're you doing to day? Are you all looking for a play that has huge upside potential with very little down side risk, does that ring a bell?\nReason for the post today is something just came across my deck. It's perhaps the best thing I've seen in the last 6 month. Do you have 60 seconds for me to share the idea with you, do you have a minute?\n\nName of the company, Ebay, it's is a low cutting e-commerce company that has really high margin profits compare to its competition. The stock now at 49, down from ATH at 61 several months ago. It's average price target is 55$. Its PE is 6.7 compare to Etsy's ~71, while they basically having similar bussiness model, make the stock really undervalued.\n   In addition, the next month gonna be the best month of Ebay as the world go back into lockdown. Online sale will soar back, especially electronic sale. This is where everything Ebay favor due to the new Xbox, PS5, Nvidia new card, AMD cards and chips. They are all in shortage due to scalpers making big money reselling them on ebay. This shortage will last long and each of them sold will get ebay the juicy 10%.\n\n\n\n\nPosition: 55c or 60c(yolo+ dirt cheap) exp 01/15/2021 or \n02/2021. The 55c will be the safest 100% profit option that you have ever buy. The only problem is that you didn't buy more.",

        "selftext": "I'm new to investing and the stockmarket so please forgive me if I haven't posted enough info about what I want to do. And apologies in advance if I'm flagrantly misusing the wrong terminology too!\n\nThat being said, I have a lot of knowledge of video games so I wanted to first invest in esports and video game streaming.\n\nI am currently interested in Tencent, Huya and Activision Blizzard.\n\nTencent because they have League of Legends and the tournaments associated... as well a large holding in Huya and Douya who are set to merge creating a massive video game streaming service in China akin to Twitch. Tencent are also a very large multi-media company owning many other communications and technology businesses etc\n\nHuya since they are a large streaming platform and is quite a cheap stock (for me).\n\nActivision-Blizzard since they have some good video game IP's and a good hold of esports tournaments and video games which I think will grow. They own the esports competitions in which their games take place.\n\nIn general, I'm not sure about EA and tournaments for sports games, I just don't think it will grow like games akin to CS:GO, LoL, SC2. Activision Blizzard does have some failing games I think right now. Activions-Blizzards own Overwatch and Hearthstone games are dying and I don't see anything big coming out. CoD Warzone has proved popular but I dont think the new CoD's will generate near enough excitement as they used to.\n\nPerhaps I should invest in some hyper casual games and mobile apps too (Sciplay, King etc) but I am curious as to what others think!\n\nTo diversify and invest in some infrastructure im thinking to invest in AMD or Nvidia and perhaps MSI as well.\n\nAgain this is my first dip into the lake, and I wanted to start with video game related stocks. I will definitely invest in others to diversify my portfolio. What do other people think with video games right now, and is it a good place for me to start? I find the whole sector really interesting and it's something close to my heart as a passionate long time video gamer :)",

So, I have deposited and invested in the stock market all the money I managed to save up in the last month as I deposited 3500$ in my eToro portfolio on the 12th of November and I am already up more than 7% in just two weeks. \n\nAs my portfolio has constantly outperform the big 3 indexes the Nasdaq100, the SP500 and the Dow Jones 30 almost every day since starting my portfolio. Here is a comparison of my portfolio vs the indexes since starting as I am up over 7%. [Portfolio v Index](https://ibb.co/pRnQLQf)\n\nSo i wondered? Is it really bad to own more stocks? Is less &gt; more? What is your opinion on this subject? I believe that it is way better to be invested in more companies and to add and grow your position in time as you also see how the companies evolve and you can also do some price averaging.\n\nSo here is my current portfolio composition as I split all my money equally to start, I will go into very few little details about everyone so I don\u2019t make this a 2 hour read time.\n\nI will start now by going alphabetically and not in the most important order as the first company that I own is BYD which is a rival company for both Tesla and NIO in the EV market as they focus on cars, new energy solutions and electronics. They are also developing a lot of commercial EV like buses, coaches and taxis which will be a great addressable market for them as they are not rivaled in those segments at the moment. The company has gone up a lot in value this year as you can see in this graph and have a Forward P/E of more than 100 but I believe this company will greatly expand its sales and be one of the leaders in the segment especially in China which is the biggest EV market.

They are the biggest company in the world and they continue to expand with new products and services every day, I don\u2019t see this company going down in the short term or the long term as they have pretty expensive at a 35 P/E but earnings are still rising especially with more subscription based income coming in with the release of the Apple One Bundle.

        "selftext": "So I have stock in INTC and AMD and today has been a weird day and I am trying to work out what happened. So I know if stock goes up and down it affects the NASDAQ index, but somehow it works the otherway around aswell. Intel was at 3-4% green for a long time, but at the end of the day NASDAQ tanked and so did intel and AMD. How does the falling of big companies like FB and AAPL affect the stocks on AMD and INTC. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStill kind of a noob on the subject so any help is appreciated.",
