        "selftext": "WDC is a hard drive and storage solutions company with promising fundamentals and very low current price. They have an earnings report on the 30th that I am almost certain will be positive considering I work at target and these things have been flying off the shelves from people working at home an needing either extra drive space or an external drive. There\u2019s also the cloud computing aspect to take into account. Since were all retards here I\u2019m sure none ya know that the could use actually just massive server rooms filled with thousands of TB of special hard drives and with everything going in the direction of cloud storage companies will need to build more and more storage facilities eventually.\n\nWhat do the rest of you think?",
