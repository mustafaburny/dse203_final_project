        "selftext": "I'm brand new to the game at 41 years old. I had a little savings and thought now would be a good time to get in and get my feet wet with the basics, learn the ins and outs, I've been doing a lot of research on Etrade, Ameri, Stash, and Yahoo Fin. Anyway, I got in on CARR at $14.22 when it dipped and i'm seeing it going up, already about to meet the 52wk high. I've seen a couple quotes of the target price being at $21.00. I am interested in long-term investing, but also doing some day trading. So far, the day trading hasn't been very profitable by spreading out my buys (about $1K worth). I'm focusing on the 5G sector (AMD, TSM, GLW, RTX). Anyway, my question is to anyone willing to help a rookie out...should I set a sell limit at $21 for CARR and just take my profits and reinvest in something else, maybe set it a $1 lower and settle for those earnings, or should I let it ride for the long-haul? Thank you to anyone willing to take the time to offer any comments, ideas, or suggestions!",
