        "selftext": "3 companies will be added to SP500 which are: \"Match Group Inc. (NASD:MTCH) which will replace Perrigo Company plc (NYSE:PRGO) in the S&amp;P 500, Ceridian HCM Holding Inc. (NYSE:CDAY), and Brown &amp; Brown Inc. (NYSE:BRO) will move to the S&amp;P 500, replacing Unum Group (NYSE:UNM) and NOV Inc.\"(Nyse:Nov.)\n\n3 companies will also change in sp400 midcap and sp600 smallcap index. A notable change is \"Healthcare Services Group which will replace MicroStrategy Inc. (NASD:MSTR) in the S&amp;P SmallCap 600. \" Source: PrNewsWire.  The changes will happen on September 20th Monday.\n\nMicrostrategy will no longer be in any S&amp;P index, the company worth 7 billion dollars is too high to be in the 2 billion or under smallcap index but was not upgraded to midcap index. I was suprised on some companies not being added to sp500 such as dell or zoom. What other stocks could be added in the sp500 in the future?",
