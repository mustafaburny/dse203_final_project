Plans already in motion to spin up a public offering for their COVID-19 Treatment company Vicromax.\n\nBioSig bought an antiviral which has shown great promise. Their study was just published in [medical journal](https://f1000research.com/articles/9-361). They submitted to be [approved for FDA Phase 2](https://www.biosig.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/188/mayo-clinic-preparing-to-commence-phase-ii-fda-clinical) Trials on April 16th. The FDA has 30 days to object or they are automatically approved to continue.\n\nOnce an IND is submitted, the FDA has 30 days to object to the IND or it automatically becomes effective and clinical trials may begin.
