The US is considering imposing export restrictions on China's Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC)\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/05/us-considers-blacklisting-chinas-largest-chipmaker-as-tech-tensions-escalate.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/05/us-considers-blacklisting-chinas-largest-chipmaker-as-tech-tensions-escalate.html)\n\nWhat's that? They're a partially government owned company that manufactures semiconductors for companies like Qualcomm ($QCOM), Broadcom ($AVGO), and Texas Instruments ($TXN)\n\nWith tech overbought on a level not seen since the dot-com bubble and the China trade war potentially cutting off one of the key manufacturers of semiconductors to the three major companies that can make 5g chipsets, I'm not very bullish on technology right now.\n\nThe SoC used to implement wireless modems in most of our mobile devices is made by $QCOM and they rely on SMIC to manufacture it.\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-smic/qualcomm-turns-to-chinas-smic-for-snapdragon-chip-production-idUSKBN0F825Y20140703](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-smic/qualcomm-turns-to-chinas-smic-for-snapdragon-chip-production-idUSKBN0F825Y20140703)\n\nNot only this but there were major security flaws in Qualcomm chips disclosed recently: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2020/08/06/hundreds-of-millions-of-android-phones-can-spy-on-users-as-400-snapdragon-security-flaws-confirmed-qualcomm-google-lg-samsung-oneplus/#336b149660b2](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2020/08/06/hundreds-of-millions-of-android-phones-can-spy-on-users-as-400-snapdragon-security-flaws-confirmed-qualcomm-google-lg-samsung-oneplus/#336b149660b2) \n\nAlso, Qualcomm's modems are not only found in Android devices: [https://www.macworld.com/article/3527277/qualcomm-x60-5g-modem-apple-iphone.html](https://www.macworld.com/article/3527277/qualcomm-x60-5g-modem-apple-iphone.html) \n\n[https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21138264/apple-5g-antenna-qualcomm-x55-modem-mmwave-iphone-2020-rumor](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21138264/apple-5g-antenna-qualcomm-x55-modem-mmwave-iphone-2020-rumor)\n\nbut also the iPhone, and they're making the 5g modem for the iPhone too.\n\nSo you can see why the stock has run up so high! The China trade war will slow 5g adoption, and short term this will be bad for tech stocks.\n\nHave a look at my shitty $QCOM TA, and see how this is unprecedented this is.

        "selftext": " **Psycho Market Recap - Friday, September 4, 2020**\n\nStocks continued falling on Friday after a sell-off yesterday led the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ to close their worst session in months. Remarkably, however, benchmarks and big tech companies were able to rebound from deep in the red to finish the day modestly red. However, in context we are amid an incredible rally off the COVID-induced lows in March.\n\nThe S&amp;P finished the day 1.06% down, the Nasdaq 1.97% down, and the Dow 0.74% down.\n\nAt one point, the Nasdaq fell as much as 5% paring losses, as the pullback in tech stocks continued. The index is now firmly below the 12,000, after crossing that threshold for the first time on Wednesday. Interestingly, energy, utilities, and financial sectors outperformed the broader, falling no more than 1.6% each.\n\n\u201cThursday\u2019s mini-crash left the door open for more selling, and investors have rushed through it today in a hurry to take profits before more downside arrives,\u201d said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG.\n\nThe market ran out of steam and encountered heavy profit-taking to form a pullback. These pullbacks are healthy and allow the stage for investors to average down or enter new positions.\n\nThursday\u2019s plunge came in absence of a clear external catalyst, with newly released data on weekly jobless claims topping expectations Thursday morning, hitting single digit unemployment rate of 8.4% vs estimates of 10.2%. Furthermore, developments around a coronavirus vaccine candidate seem to be going well with the CDC announcing to states to prepare for a vaccine distribution by Nov 1. This is in contrast to the WHO making a release today with a new model that projects 1.9M more deaths by end of 2020 due to COVID.\n\nOn other fronts mail-in voting will go ahead as planned. The stimulus talks still seem to be going nowhere with Democrats and Republicans unable to agree on the terms. This morning economic adviser Larry Kudlow, in an interview with Bloomberg, said that \u201cwe can absolutely live with it (coronavirus)\u201d and \u201cthe economy is on a self-sustaining path to recovery\u2026 and will continue along those lines to surprise on the upside\u201d. This was in response to a question of what would happen in case Democrats and Republicans could not agree on a package by years end.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* After beginning the day deeply in the red, big tech stocks were mostly able to recover  \n\n   * Apple ($AAPL) went from 8.04% down to finishing 0.7% down\n   * Amazon ($AMZN) went from 7% down to 2.15% down\n   * Microsoft \u201c($MSFT) went from 5.6% down to finishing 1.4% down.\n* The volatility index (VIX) finished 8.8% down\n* Broadcomm ($AVGO ) reported better than expected results. Today got upgraded by UBS Group from $335 to $425, by JP Morgan Chase from $365 to $420, and Keycorp from $360 to $410. The stock performed healthily clocking a 3% gain.\n* $PVH price target raised by Barclays from $51 to $58 and by Deutsche Bank from $42 to $59. Stock is currently at $61.50\n* Shares of Carnival Corporation ($CCL) rose 5% after the company said it would be resuming some cruise operations under its Costa brand this weekend\n* Rocket Companies ($RKT) Reported earnings 2 days ago, finished 7% down on the day.\n* Camping World ($CWH) saw its CEO buy $100k in its shares, and recently also saw a dividend increase announcement on 8/24/2020 by 12% from $0.08 to $0.09\n\nThoughts of a Psycho Trader....",

        "selftext": "This confirms months of speculation...here are the initial thoughts from analysts.\n\n**Needham** \\- \"Will It Be Game Changing? We Shall See.\"\n\n\"We believe the acquisition represents a big risk but with potential huge awards. From a financial perspective, this acquisition is the largest deal in NVIDIA's history. We are not concerned about the size of the deal because NVIDIA generated $4.3BN of free cash flow in FY20 and is on track to generate $5.2BN in FY21, and hence we expect it to make up the $12BN in cash fairly quickly, even without a contribution from Arm. Additionally, the dilution represents only 7% of total shares - not a major event, in our view.\"\n\n\"Strategically, we believe there are several advantages: in the near-term, Arm IP is ubiquitous in the mobile phone and tablet markets with 95% share. NVDA can harvest that steady cash flow stream to finance growth. ARM has a cumulative number of licenses signed of 1,767 as of F4Q19 and 22.8 billion royalty units as reported by licensee. Longer-term, Arm is gaining inroads in the all the major secular growth drivers in technology including cloud and infrastructure equipment, edge IoT, robotics and self-driving vehicles. Arm technology is being used in advanced MCUs for IoT devices such as communication chips and sensors and broad range of networking equipment.\"\n\n\"On the skeptical side of the equation, we wonder about the anti-trust factors as Arm is the \"Arms-dealer\" in the semiconductor industry with a long list of customers, which include competitors, such as TI, MRVL, AMD, IFX, QCOM, AAPL, Samsung, NXPI, AVGO and others. We also need to have a better understanding of the long-term revenue ramp and overall TAM. Arm's net sales have been lackluster for the past two fiscal years, growing 3% in FY19 and declining in FY18 due to deterioration in overall business conditions in the semiconductor industry.\"\n\n**Jefferies**\u00a0\\- \"NVDA + ARM = $50 EPS Power in 2025\"\n\n\" We view the deal as transformative, positioning NVDA not just to capture 80% of the ecosystem value in the data center, but also unify the compute ecosystem between the edge and data center. We think the merged company has a 5-yr EPS power of $50, and increase our price target to $680, and bull-case to $1,000.\"\n\n\"We estimate the deal to be slightly accretive the first year after close.\"\n\n\"Transformative Deal - Heterogeneous Data Center Scale Solution Provider: In previous computing eras, one ecosystem typically controlled 80% of the profits of the ecosystem \u2013 in PCs it was Wintel, in Smartphones it is Apple. Due to the ecosystem it has created in Acceleration (processor, interconnect (MLNX), software stack including CUDA and vertical market software), we\u2019ve argued that Nvidia was best positioned to capture 80% of the profits of the Parallel Processing Era. However, with ARM, we think Nvidia is poised to also offer general purpose, heterogeneous data center scale solutions and ultimately capture up to 80% of the value of the serial processing part of the data center ecosystem as well. We also think that ARM gives it a larger moat in the data center.\"\n\n\"Transformative Deal - Unifying the Edge with the Data Center: the Cell Phone / Server Computing Era was the first where compute bifurcated, and two separate ecosystems operated in parallel (Apple\u2019s ecosystem in the Smartphone, and Wintel in the data center). Should Nvidia successfully acquire ARM, then the compute ecosystem will be unified from edge to data center, and we would expect Nvidia to offer more highly integrated compute solutions across the entire compute ecosystem, and realize the lion\u2019s share of the profits in this 4th Tectonic Shift in Computing.\"\n\n\"Five-year EPS Power of $50. We believe this is a differentiated interpretation of NVidia's earnings potential which stems from our view that Nvidia is supplying an ecosystem in the data center, much like Apple supplies to the smart phone market, or Intel and Microsoft did in PCs. In contrast to other traditional semiconductor competitors, Nvidia's ecosystem extends beyond processors, to high speed interconnect (MLNX) and a software stack. During the PC Era, Microsoft's PC operating profit was similar to Intel's, and we think Nvidia's earnings potential framework should be modeled more like Wintel, with half of its earnings power coming from the ecosystem that it created. We model Nvidia Data Center processor revenues of $34bn in 2025, and Data Center Ecosystem (software) of an additional $34bn.\"\n\n**RBC -** \"We continue to believe the same three major points: 1) biggest hurdle in our view is approval/official closing of transaction; 2) if the transaction closes, we think this would be a notable negative for Intel and a notable positive for Nvidia; and 3) with Apple, Amazon, and now Nvidia, a robust software ecosystem is ready to support an ARM-based server environment over the long term.\"\n\n\" What do Apple and Nvidia have in common? Access to successful software ecosystems. Since x86 has been the dominant player in the server market, Nvidia could argue that the transaction would create more competition against the x86 market. Currently, the market is largely Intel \\~85\u201390% (x86) and AMD 8\u201310% (x86) and a few points \u201cOther\u201d depending on how one defines the total market. If Nvidia puts research and development dollars behind the transaction, an ecosystem to compete against x86 would be possible, in our view, given Nvidia\u2019s success with CUDA. Finally, AWS has a new Graviton product based on ARM architecture. It is arguably a stable/solid alternative given its lower power consumption. We\u2019ve seen this story twice in the past in the Flops/Watt (GPU&gt;CPU) and TCO (AMD&gt;INTC\"\n\n**Raymond James** \\- \" As we had suspected earlier, much of the justification for the deal in the presentation centers on the datacenter market. Based on our initial read of the presentation, we view this as an assault on Intel\u2019s server CPU business. The intention would seem to be to become able to offer server customers a broader roadmap that covers both CPU, GPU and server. It\u2019s yet unclear however about how a NVDA datacenter business that would offer server CPUs benefit from NVDA owning ARM as opposed to simply being a licensee. Nonetheless, we do view this as a move on NVDA\u2019s part to compete more fully with both INTC and AMD in the server pace. MRVL is also an ARM licensee for server CPUs, but since MRVL has already announced that they would only pursue custom server CPU engagements going forward, we don\u2019t expect much impact to MRVL. Undoubtedly, the combination of ARM\u2019s leading processor IP with NVDA\u2019s GPU and AI IP will create a powerful combination. But it\u2019s not immediately clear how NVDA intends to leverage having ARM under their own ownership, and will expect that vision to be part of the company\u2019s presentation.\n\n\"The presentation notes that NVDA intends to continue ARM\u2019s open licensing model and NVDA IP would also be added to ARM\u2019s licensing business. That could certainly become additive to the revenue for the total licensing business, but more details will need to be provided to understand the potential revenue synergies.\"\n\n\"The transaction requires regulatory approval the U.K., China, the European Union and the United States. China approval will naturally be viewed as a risk given US/China trade tensions. Since ARM IP is the foundation of nearly all handsets and IOT devices, we would expect the deal to be highly scrutinized, and we would expect that NVDA would need to provide assurances that it will continue an open licensing model. NVDA is an ARM licensee, but ARM processors is a small part of NVDA\u2019s business, limited to the automotive business (3% of revenue) and the Nintendo Switch custom processor (4% of revenue, by our estimates). Therefore, since there is a very small part of revenue in which NVDA competes with ARM licensees, we don\u2019t expect that to raise significant regulatory concerns.\"",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, September 2, 2020**\n\nStocks continued advancing on Wednesday, with investors encouraged by positive economic data and moderating COVID-19 infection rate in previous epicenters. Tech stocks once again led the charge, with industry bellwethers like Amazon ($AMZN) and Google ($GOOG) all opening at new record high. Apple ($AAPL) and Tesla ($TSLA) pulled back sharply from their post-stock split highs.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday during a congressional hearing of the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis that he believed a bipartisan agreement on further fiscal stimulus \u201cstill should be reached. \n\nNewly announced economic data continues to surpass Wall St estimates. The ISM manufacturing index hit its highest levels since Aug 2018 and construction spending increasing. However, reports on the labor market are showing slower recovery. Per CNBC, \u2018private payroll gains in August totaled 428,000, or less than half the 1 million jobs expected\u2019.\n\nFollowing the best month in decades, investors appear hopeful and active in a usually slow month. There\u2019s hope that increasingly better economic data, support from the Federal Reserve, the potential for fiscal stimulus, and a vaccine in the short, and states reopening can continue to push the market higher.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Macy\u2019s ($M) temporarily alleviated fears of bankruptcy with a surprisingly encouraging earnings report. Stock was modestly down today.\n* AMC\u2019s ($AMC) news that it would be reopening more theaters this weekend. Stock was up 16% today.\n* Intel $INTC launches 11th Gen Intel processors with, reportedly the world\u2019s best processors for thin-and-light laptops. More than 150 designs based on 11th  Gen Intel Core processors are expected\n* Amarin[ $](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMRN&amp;src=cashtag_click)AMRN declined 28% on midday Wednesday as oral arguments on its appeal of a March ruling invalidating certain patents of its heart drug Vascepa begin\n* Berenberg decreased ($AAL) American Airlines price target from $14 to $10. (which is strange considering that today, they upgraded ($LUV) Southwest Airlines)\n* ($SDC) Smile Direct Club insiders (CEO, CFO and Director) purchased a combined 1.96 Million shares of stock for about $16 Million. Shares are up 23% so far in the day\n* Nvidia ($NVDA) has been on a tear recently.

        "selftext": " **Psycho Market Recap - Friday, September 4, 2020**\n\nStocks continued falling on Friday after a sell-off yesterday led the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ to close their worst session in months. Remarkably, however, benchmarks and big tech companies were able to rebound from deep in the red to finish the day modestly red. However, in context we are amid an incredible rally off the COVID-induced lows in March.\n\nThe S&amp;P finished the day 1.06% down, the Nasdaq 1.97% down, and the Dow 0.74% down.\n\nAt one point, the Nasdaq fell as much as 5% paring losses, as the pullback in tech stocks continued. The index is now firmly below the 12,000, after crossing that threshold for the first time on Wednesday. Interestingly, energy, utilities, and financial sectors outperformed the broader, falling no more than 1.6% each.\n\n\u201cThursday\u2019s mini-crash left the door open for more selling, and investors have rushed through it today in a hurry to take profits before more downside arrives,\u201d said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG.\n\nThe market ran out of steam and encountered heavy profit-taking to form a pullback. These pullbacks are healthy and allow the stage for investors to average down or enter new positions.\n\nThursday\u2019s plunge came in absence of a clear external catalyst, with newly released data on weekly jobless claims topping expectations Thursday morning, hitting single digit unemployment rate of 8.4% vs estimates of 10.2%. Furthermore, developments around a coronavirus vaccine candidate seem to be going well with the CDC announcing to states to prepare for a vaccine distribution by Nov 1. This is in contrast to the WHO making a release today with a new model that projects 1.9M more deaths by end of 2020 due to COVID.\n\nOn other fronts mail-in voting will go ahead as planned. The stimulus talks still seem to be going nowhere with Democrats and Republicans unable to agree on the terms. This morning economic adviser Larry Kudlow, in an interview with Bloomberg, said that \u201cwe can absolutely live with it (coronavirus)\u201d and \u201cthe economy is on a self-sustaining path to recovery\u2026 and will continue along those lines to surprise on the upside\u201d. This was in response to a question of what would happen in case Democrats and Republicans could not agree on a package by years end.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* After beginning the day deeply in the red, big tech stocks were mostly able to recover  \n\n   * Apple ($AAPL) went from 8.04% down to finishing 0.7% down\n   * Amazon ($AMZN) went from 7% down to 2.15% down\n   * Microsoft \u201c($MSFT) went from 5.6% down to finishing 1.4% down.\n* The volatility index (VIX) finished 8.8% down\n* Broadcomm ($AVGO ) reported better than expected results. Today got upgraded by UBS Group from $335 to $425, by JP Morgan Chase from $365 to $420, and Keycorp from $360 to $410. The stock performed healthily clocking a 3% gain.\n* $PVH price target raised by Barclays from $51 to $58 and by Deutsche Bank from $42 to $59. Stock is currently at $61.50\n* Shares of Carnival Corporation ($CCL) rose 5% after the company said it would be resuming some cruise operations under its Costa brand this weekend\n* Rocket Companies ($RKT) Reported earnings 2 days ago, finished 7% down on the day.\n* Camping World ($CWH) saw its CEO buy $100k in its shares, and recently also saw a dividend increase announcement on 8/24/2020 by 12% from $0.08 to $0.09\n\nThoughts of a Psycho Trader....",
