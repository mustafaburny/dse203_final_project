        "selftext": "First of all, I am incredibly privileged. When my grandpa passed away in March, I inherited $30,000. I had $10,000 saved up as well from working the prior summer and that $10,000 was already invested in the stock market. In high school I found out about stocks in my economics class and the day I turned 18 I invested every penny I had. \n\nOnce again, I am privileged to be able to invest this money at all.. I have a college fund to pay my tuition, I don\u2019t have to worry about when my next meal is coming, and I have the freedom to spend my money as I choose. \n\nAnyways, in March &amp; April when the market crashed I decided it was time to really dive into the stock market. I spent about 5 hours every day researching companies and I\u2019m here to share what I\u2019ve learned. \n\nIn my opinion, **the** **companies** **you** **invest** **in** **should** **be** **an** **extension** **of** **your** **worldview.** Where do you think the world will be in 10 years+ and what industries will prosper from the change. As I was raised in a liberal family and hold these values, I\u2019m quite concerned with **Climate** **Change**. I\u2019ve taken college classes in this realm since and learned more about the risks we face. I believe that any company whose mission revolves around mitigating the climate crisis will prosper in the coming decades. \n\n------------------------------------\n\nThat being said, I\u2019ll list the companies I hold and a very brief synopsis of what they do and why I hold their stock. **Please** **do** **your** **own** **research**; this is only meant to introduce young investors to a certain mindset that I hold and the companies that I choose to support. \n\n--------------------------\n\n**Tesla** **(TSLA)** \n\nportfolio weight: **22.86%**\n\ngain/loss **1026%** **gain**\n\nYou guys all know what Tesla is about. They are the premier EV company with goals of cutting battery costs by 56% and producing 20,000,000+ cars in the decade. They also have a growing energy business with solar roofs, panels, battery storage and an autobidder software. Tesla is priced insanely high by traditional metrics. If these metrics are your investing style then it\u2019s not for you. If you\u2019re like me, and you look for companies to hold for decades then I believe Tesla is one of the best investments out there. What other company will benefit from the transition to renewables in response to climate change and changing political conditions?\n\n----------------------------------\n\n**MP** **Materials** **(MP)**\n\nportfolio weight: **12.68%**\n\ngain/loss: **197%**  **gain**\n\nMP is the only active rare earth mineral miner in the U.S. They produce neodymium concentrates which are important components in NDPR magnets; used in EV motors, wind turbines, electronics &amp; much more. \n\nI bought MP during their early pre-merger days and have already seen considerable profits in a few months. I\u2019ve been shaving this position to keep it around 10% because it is a commodity play which can be quite risky. That being said, rare earths are expected to appreciate substantially in price as EV demand increases. Furthermore, MP is moving downstream to refine their rare earths themselves, as they currently ship them to China to be refined, and in the future they plan on manufacturing their own NDPR batteries. This will increase their margins greatly. \n\n----------------------------------\n\n**Planet** **13** **(PLNHF)**\n\nportfolio weight **5.35%**\n\ngain/loss: **147.71** **gain**\n\nThis one is a MJ stock and I\u2019m focusing mostly on my Climate Change investments on this post so I\u2019ll keep it brief. They own a superstore in Vegas and have their own brands. I believe the MJ industry is going to explode soon and PLNHF will benefit. \n\n--------------------------------------\n\n**Jinko** **Solar** **(JKS)**\n\nportfolio weight: **4.91%**\n\ngain/loss: **268.88%** **gain**\n\nJinko Solar is a leading solar panel manufacturer in China. They\u2019ve seen market consolidation in China and are poised to benefit from increasing demand and incentives around solar energy. Specifically, South East Asia is expected to see dramatic growth in renewables as China/India are responsible for a large portion of global emissions and are also seeing considerable growth in GDP and population. It\u2019s a play on the South East Asian economy and renewable industry. \n\n-------------------------------------\n\n**SolarEdge** **(SEDG)**:\n\nportfolio weight: **4.89%**\n\ngain/loss: **108.5%** **gain**\n\nSolarEdge is the global leader in panel inverters, which turn the sun\u2019s D.C. current into usable electricity for households (A.C. current). The inverter space is a much more consolidated industry with higher margins than panels. They trade at a more expensive multiple and are expected to see dramatic top and bottom line growth in the coming years. Solar panels need inverters to perform; simple as that. With fewer companies focused on this space, I expect the top players to have a large market share and grow along with the solar energy market. SEDG is also expanding into the energy storage and EV charging markets with recent acquisitions. \n\n--------------------------------------\n\n**Enphase** **Energy** **(ENPH)**\n\nportfolio weight: **4.43%** \n\ngain/loss: **203.08%** **gain**\n\nEnphase is also in the inverter market, with their differentiated microinverters. Micro Inverters are generally used in smaller systems and optimal for residential solar. Everything said above about the inverter market is true for Enphase as well. Enphase\u2019s business goes beyond inverters though. They are targeting a full residential energy ecosystem, with storage and their \u201cEnlighten\u201d software App, which will manage home energy usage and sell excess energy back to the grid. Enphase is very much a play on a future decentralized microgrid, with homes trading energy to each other as prices fluctuate. \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n**Canadian** **Solar** **(CSIQ)**\n\nportfolio weight: **4.42%**\n\ngain/loss: **118.32%** *gain**\n\nCanadian Solar is another panel manufacturing company. They are also seeing growth in market share as smaller players struggle during the pandemic. CSIQ is a low cost producer with residential, commercial and grid level projects. They are planning on expanding their recurring revenue stream through full and partial ownership of solar projects. You can read more about this on the IR page. CSIQ is a pure solar play with an international footprint and vast management expertise. They will certainly benefit from any movement towards renewables, especially if legislation is passed to set a price on carbon. \n\n--------------------------\n\n**Lemonade** **LMND** \n\nportfolio weight: **3.93%**\n\ngain/loss: **112.52** **gain**\n\nLemonade is not a climate change related investment. It\u2019s highly speculative but I think their management team and business model is really cool so I put some money in (and quickly more than doubled it). I\u2019ll be brief here, but basically they are a home/renter/pet insurance company that takes a flat 25% cut of premiums as revenue and uses the remaining money to pay out claims. They aim to align incentives by donating anything left over beyond the 25% to a charity of customers choosing. Also, their use of AI makes the registration and claims process seamless and \u201cdelights\u201d customers. \n\n----------------------------\n\n**TPI** **Composites** **(TPIC)**\n\nportfolio weight: **3.73%**\n\ngain/loss: **153.99%** **gain**\n\nTPIC manufacturers wind blade composites. They supply the top five wind turbine companies outside of China. I wrote about them on prior posts so I\u2019ll just copy &amp; paste here:\n63% of total wind blade manufacturing is outsourced to companies like TPI and they are the market leader in this space with about 20% market share globally. The business currently has low margins, but they target a 12% EBITDA margin for the future, and they trade at a measly 0.74 P/S ratio currently. They are also expanding into EV composite manufacturing and have a contract with Workhorse to manufacture vehicle parts for them.\n-----------------------------\n\n**Skyworks** **Solutions** **(SWKS)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.83%**\n\ngain/loss: **60.57%** **gain**\n\nSkyworks is a semiconductor focused on connectivity chips for all kinds of devices. They aren\u2019t climate change related which is the point of this post so I\u2019ll leave it at that.\n\n----------------------------\n\n**Tattooed** **Chef** **(TTCF)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.65%**\n\ngain/loss: **55.90** **gain**\n\nTattooed Chef is a play on the rising plant-based food trend. They make a variety of frozen food items, widely available in Walmart, Costco and Target. They are expanding into Whole Foods, Trader Joe\u2019s and many more stores, where I expect them to be very successful. The plant based market is exploding for a couple of reasons. Firstly, there is more research on the health benefits of a plant based diet, with athletes such as Chris Paul &amp; Todd Gurley endorsing these brands. Also, consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the threat of climate change and how avoiding red meat can have a positive impact on the planet. I expect TTCF to benefit off of these trends and continue innovating in the plant-based space. I bought in 3 weeks ago and the price has exploded since then. \n\n-------------------------\n\n**Workhorse** **(WKHS)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.60%**\n\ngain/loss: **35.90%** **gain**\n\nWorkhorse is an electric delivery van company. They manufacture last mile electric vehicles and are developing drones to further decrease last mile delivery costs. They are a play on the e-commerce industry and electrification of vehicles. I\u2019m invested in them because last mile delivery is responsible for a large chunk of transportation carbon emissions and in desperate need of electrification. I also believe that Workhorse will get a large chunk of the upcoming USPS contract which will provide a stable revenue stream.\n---------------------\n\n**Aphria** **(APHA)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.45%**\n\ngain/loss: **53%** **gain**\n\nAphria is another MJ play for me. Once again they aren\u2019t a climate change investment so I\u2019ll keep it brief. They just finalized a merger with Tilray, making them the biggest cannabis producer in the world. They are based in Canada and I believe they will be the market leader in Europe, due to their infrastructure advantage through owning CC Pharma.\n\n----------------------------\n\n**Vestas** **Wind** **Systems** **(VWDRY)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.40%**\n\ngain/loss: **197.44%** **gain**\n\nVestas is the global leader in wind turbine manufacturing and installation. They are one of the few pure wind plays in the stock market, making them an attractive choice for anybody looking to get exposure to wind. A big driver if future growth will be their service and maintainace business, which their management team has been focused on in recent quarters. This is a higher margin business with consistent recurring revenues. \n\n----------------------------\n\n**Facebook** **(FB)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.38%**\n\ngain/loss: **20.61%** **gain\n\nI\u2019m selling out of FB very soon but I still hold them for now. FB is an incredible business and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll see growth in the future, but it just isn\u2019t for me (anymore). I consider ethics a lot in my investments, which many of you may consider stupid but idc. \n\n---------------------------\n\n**Hannon** **Armstrong** **(HASI)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.18%**\n\ngain/loss: **57.40%** **gain**\n\nHASI is a REIT, which solely makes climate change related investments. They invest in the land under solar projects, energy efficient buildings and much more. HASI is a great dividend play and I expect their stock price to appreciate as climate change worries are exacerbated in the future. \n\n---------------------------\n\n**Beyond** **Meat** **(BYND)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.10%**\n\ngain/loss: **21.24%** **gain**\n\nI made a post with some DD earlier this year on Beyond so I\u2019ll just link that below:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/if9tmj/beyond_meat_bynd_fundamental_analysis_with_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\n---------------------------\n\n**Brookefield** **Renewable** **Partners** **(BEPC)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.06%**\n\ngain/loss: **87.23%** **gain**\n\nBEPC owns and operates a portfolio of renewable energy assets. Earlier this year they completed a merger with Terraform Power, expanding their solar &amp; wind footprint. They are also the primer owner of hydroelectric power plants, which produce a consistent source of electricity. BEPC has a strong management team and owns valuable assets that will greatly appreciate in value as government incentives expand around renewable energy consumption. They also pay a nice dividend. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n**Disney** **(DIS)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.03%**\n\ngain/loss: **50.06%** **gain** \n\nI\u2019m invested in Disney mostly for some portfolio diversity. I\u2019m a big fan of their streaming platform and business strategy revolving around that. This one isn\u2019t climate change related so I\u2019ll leave it at that.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**First** **Solar** **(FSLR)**\n\nportfolio weight: **1.84%**\n\ngain/loss: **70.47%** **gain**\n\nFirst Solar is an American based panel manufacturer and projects operator. They used differentiated technology with Cadmoum Telluride panels, which are supposed to increase output and lifetime at a higher cost. FSLR is just another play on the growing solar industry, and being U.S. based seems to reward them a higher earnings multiple in the market than their peers. They also have a beautiful balance sheet. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n**Trulieve** **Cannabis** **(TCNFF)**\n\nportfolio weight: **1.44%**\n\ngain/loss: **5.33%** **gain**\n\nTrulieve is another Cannabis play. This one based in the U.S. with a large medical market in Florida. Nuff said. (Do your own research) \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**Star** **Peak** **Energy** **Transition** **(STPK)**\n\nportfolio weight **1.43%**\n\ngain/loss: **55.45%** **gain**\n\nStar peak is a brand new holding for me and already shot up like crazy. It\u2019s one of these merger companies (the word is censored on this subreddit). merging with Stem energy storage. Stem is involved in the battery storage industry, with mostly grid level storage systems. They currently have an even larger market share than Tesla and my reason for holding this stock is mostly as a hedge against Tesla\u2019s energy business. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n**Shopify** **(SHOP)**\n\nportfolio weight: **1.10%**\n\ngain/loss: **18.19%** **gain**\n\nShopify is an eCommerce platform, which allows customers to seamlessly design their own website and process payments. I\u2019ve used Shopify in the past and am a big fan of the business, which is a big part of why I\u2019m invested. They have a steep valuation but I plan on holding for 10+ years. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nTotal gain: **181.52%**\n\n(Note: I\u2019ve taken some profits on a few of my stocks so the unrealized gain from my current holdings is less than my \u201ctotal\u201d gain by a few % points.)\n\n--------------------------\n\nYes, I\u2019m young and idealistic and have a lot to learn but I do know a few things. Here\u2019s some of the lessons I\u2019ve learned along my 1 and a half year journey in the market. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n\nBy investing in a company, you are supporting them financially. Buying pressure on companies\u2019 stocks increases the price and allows them to raise capital more efficiently. It might be hard to hear, but **when** **you** **buy** **Exxon** **stock**, **you** **are** **helping** **them** **destroy** **our** **planet**. The same is true vice versa.  \n\n**Don\u2019t** **listen** to** **anybody** **on** **reddit**. Seriously. Nobody here knows any better than you. Do your own research, form your own judgements. If you\u2019re gonna pick individual stocks then following advice on reddit is not the way to go. Reading through investor relations pages is the best way to go. Watch videos and read articles about both sides of the story with different companies. Don\u2019t take these videos as facts though, just absorb what other people think and judge the validity of the information for yourself. It\u2019s important to **become** **an** **independent** **thinker**. This is a slow process but eventually you\u2019ll get the hang of things.\n\n**Invest** **with** **a** **10+** **year** **timeline**. This is especially true if you\u2019re young like myself. Don\u2019t concern yourself with daily or even monthly swings in a stock. Ask yourself if the company will be worth substantially more in a decade. If not, then say, if so then buy and hold. Don\u2019t try to time the market or swing trade. You\u2019re just bringing on unnecessary risk. Buy and hold and buy some more. \n\n**Assess** **your** **own** **risk** **tolerance**. As I\u2019m sure several people will point out, my portfolio is incredibly speculative and risky from a traditional viewpoint. I have a really fucking high risk tolerance, so I invest with a \u201criskier\u201d mindset. If I were to lose all my money tomorrow, I\u2019d be fine. I\u2019m going to have a college degree in a couple years and I\u2019m not worried about being able to find a job. My reason for investing is about having the financial freedom to do whatever I want in life, and not worry about money in the future. If you\u2019re investing for retirement or to pay off student loans, then I recommend taking a more conservative approach and maybe buying some index funds. However, if you\u2019re young and have a stomach for risk like myself, then go crazy.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nIn conclusion, I\u2019ve had an incredible year or so in the market. I don\u2019t expect to have even close to these same returns in the future, but I\u2019ve learned a thing or two and I\u2019m here to share this information. You may disagree with everything I said and all the stocks I own and that\u2019s okay! Don\u2019t copy my portfolio and take everything I say with a grain of salt, however I hope you find some wisdom from this post!",

        "selftext": "ALISO VIEJO, Calif. &amp; GREAT FALLS, Va.--([BUSINESS WIRE](https://www.businesswire.com/))--indie Semiconductor, a next generation automotive semiconductor and software innovator, and Thunder Bridge Acquisition II, Ltd. (Nasdaq: THBR), a special purpose acquisition company, today announced they have entered into a definitive agreement for a business combination that would result in the combined entity continuing as a publicly listed company. Upon closing of the transaction, the combined operating entity will be named indie Semiconductor, Inc. and will be listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbol INDI. The transaction reflects an implied equity value for the combined company of roughly $1.4 billion.\n\nindie is at the forefront of disruptive automotive megatrends spanning ADAS/Autonomous, Connectivity, User Experience and Vehicle Electrification. Today, indie\u2019s automotive semiconductor portfolio addresses a $16 billion market, according to IHS, which is expected to exceed $38 billion by 2025 driven by strong demand for silicon and software content in automobiles. indie\u2019s best-in-class, mixed signal system-on-a-chip (SoC) solutions are currently on 12 Tier 1 approved vendor lists, contributing to a strategic backlog position of more than $2 billion, defined as projected revenues based on existing contracts, design and pricing terms and historic production trends.\n\n\u201cThunder Bridge II has found an outstanding merger partner in indie Semiconductor,\u201d said Gary Simanson, president and CEO of Thunder Bridge II. \"Donald McClymont and his team have established a leadership franchise with a differentiated product offering, having shipped over 100 million units to Tier 1 automotive suppliers globally. By virtue of our combination, we believe that indie will have the financial firepower to accelerate the Company\u2019s strategic growth initiatives and help create an Autotech pureplay powerhouse.\u201d\n\n\u201cindie is empowering the Autotech revolution with our highly innovative system solutions,\u201d said Donald McClymont, indie\u2019s co-founder, chairman and chief executive officer. \u201cOur mixed signal SoC platforms are enabling a diverse set of rapidly emerging automotive megatrends that have reached an inflection point. Accordingly, we are excited to partner with Thunder Bridge II at this key growth juncture to capitalize on our existing design win pipeline, extend indie\u2019s product reach, drive scale and further consolidate within Autotech, ultimately creating shareholder value as a public company.\u201d\n\nUpon the closing of the transaction, the combined company will be led by indie\u2019s management team. Prior to founding indie, Donald McClymont held executive roles at Axiom, Skyworks and Conexant. He is joined by Co-founder and President Ichiro Aoki, Ph.D., and Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Scott Kee, Ph.D., as well as Chief Financial Officer and EVP of Strategy, Thomas Schiller, who previously led highly successful IPOs and M&amp;A initiatives at Skyworks, Conexant and Rockwell Semiconductor Systems. Together, the indie management team has demonstrated a track record of scaling new business and creating extraordinary shareholder value. indie is headquartered in Aliso Viejo, California, and has a global footprint of design centers and sales offices across the U.S., Europe and Asia.\n\n**Transaction Overview**\n\nThe transaction reflects an implied equity value of the combined company of $1.4 billion, based on current assumptions, with a $10.00 per share PIPE subscription price. Upon closing, the combined company will receive up to $495 million in cash, comprised of a $150 million PIPE and up to $345 million in cash held in trust by Thunder Bridge II, assuming no redemptions by THBR shareholders.
